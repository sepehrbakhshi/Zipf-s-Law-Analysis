arriving
at
vienna
early
next
morning
should
have
arrived
at
646
but
train
was
an
hour
late
budapesth
seems
a
wonderful
place
from
the
glimpse
which
i
got
of
it
from
the
train
and
the
little
i
could
walk
through
the
streets
i
feared
to
go
very
far
from
the
station
as
we
had
arrived
late
and
would
start
as
near
the
correct
time
as
possible
the
impression
i
had
was
that
we
were
leaving
the
west
and
entering
the
east
the
most
western
of
splendid
bridges
over
the
danube
which
is
here
of
noble
width
and
depth
took
us
among
the
traditions
of
turkish
rule
we
left
in
pretty
good
time
and
came
after
nightfall
to
klausenburgh
here
i
stopped
for
the
night
at
the
hotel
royale
i
had
for
dinner
or
rather
supper
a
chicken
done
up
some
way
with
red
pepper
which
was
very
good
but
thirsty
mem
get
recipe
for
mina
i
asked
the
waiter
and
he
said
it
was
called
paprika
hendl
and
that
as
it
was
a
national
dish
i
should
be
able
to
get
it
anywhere
along
the
carpathians
i
found
my
smattering
of
german
very
useful
here
indeed
i
dont
know
how
i
should
be
able
to
get
on
without
it
having
had
some
time
at
my
disposal
when
in
london
i
had
visited
the
british
museum
and
made
search
among
the
books
and
maps
in
the
library
regarding
transylvania
it
had
struck
me
that
some
foreknowledge
of
the
country
could
hardly
fail
to
have
some
importance
in
dealing
with
a
nobleman
of
that
country
i
find
that
the
district
he
named
is
in
the
extreme
east
of
the
country
just
on
the
borders
of
three
states
transylvania
moldavia
and
bukovina
in
the
midst
of
the
carpathian
mountains
one
of
the
wildest
and
least
known
portions
of
europe
i
was
not
able
to
light
on
any
map
or
work
giving
the
exact
locality
of
the
castle
dracula
as
there
are
no
maps
of
this
country
as
yet
to
compare
with
our
own
ordnance
survey
maps
but
i
found
that
bistritz
the
post
town
named
by
count
dracula
is
a
fairly
wellknown
place
i
shall
enter
here
some
of
my
notes
as
they
may
refresh
my
memory
when
i
talk
over
my
travels
with
mina
in
the
population
of
transylvania
there
are
four
distinct
nationalities
saxons
in
the
south
and
mixed
with
them
the
wallachs
who
are
the
descendants
of
the
dacians
magyars
in
the
west
and
szekelys
in
the
east
and
north
i
am
going
among
the
latter
who
claim
to
be
descended
from
attila
and
the
huns
this
may
be
so
for
when
the
magyars
conquered
the
country
in
the
eleventh
century
they
found
the
huns
settled
in
it
i
read
that
every
known
superstition
in
the
world
is
gathered
into
the
horseshoe
of
the
carpathians
as
if
it
were
the
centre
of
some
sort
of
imaginative
whirlpool
if
so
my
stay
may
be
very
interesting
mem
i
must
ask
the
count
all
about
them
i
did
not
sleep
well
though
my
bed
was
comfortable
enough
for
i
had
all
sorts
of
queer
dreams
there
was
a
dog
howling
all
night
under
my
window
which
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
or
it
may
have
been
the
paprika
for
i
had
to
drink
up
all
the
water
in
my
carafe
and
was
still
thirsty
towards
morning
i
slept
and
was
wakened
by
the
continuous
knocking
at
my
door
so
i
guess
i
must
have
been
sleeping
soundly
then
i
had
for
breakfast
more
paprika
and
a
sort
of
porridge
of
maize
flour
which
they
said
was
mamaliga
and
eggplant
stuffed
with
forcemeat
a
very
excellent
dish
which
they
call
impletata
mem
get
recipe
for
this
also
i
had
to
hurry
breakfast
for
the
train
started
a
little
before
eight
or
rather
it
ought
to
have
done
so
for
after
rushing
to
the
station
at
730
i
had
to
sit
in
the
carriage
for
more
than
an
hour
before
we
began
to
move
it
seems
to
me
that
the
further
east
you
go
the
more
unpunctual
are
the
trains
what
ought
they
to
be
in
china
all
day
long
we
seemed
to
dawdle
through
a
country
which
was
full
of
beauty
of
every
kind
sometimes
we
saw
little
towns
or
castles
on
the
top
of
steep
hills
such
as
we
see
in
old
missals
sometimes
we
ran
by
rivers
and
streams
which
seemed
from
the
wide
stony
margin
on
each
side
of
them
to
be
subject
to
great
floods
it
takes
a
lot
of
water
and
running
strong
to
sweep
the
outside
edge
of
a
river
clear
at
every
station
there
were
groups
of
people
sometimes
crowds
and
in
all
sorts
of
attire
some
of
them
were
just
like
the
peasants
at
home
or
those
i
saw
coming
through
france
and
germany
with
short
jackets
and
round
hats
and
homemade
trousers
but
others
were
very
picturesque
the
women
looked
pretty
except
when
you
got
near
them
but
they
were
very
clumsy
about
the
waist
they
had
all
full
white
sleeves
of
some
kind
or
other
and
most
of
them
had
big
belts
with
a
lot
of
strips
of
something
fluttering
from
them
like
the
dresses
in
a
ballet
but
of
course
there
were
petticoats
under
them
the
strangest
figures
we
saw
were
the
slovaks
who
were
more
barbarian
than
the
rest
with
their
big
cowboy
hats
great
baggy
dirtywhite
trousers
white
linen
shirts
and
enormous
heavy
leather
belts
nearly
a
foot
wide
all
studded
over
with
brass
nails
they
wore
high
boots
with
their
trousers
tucked
into
them
and
had
long
black
hair
and
heavy
black
moustaches
they
are
very
picturesque
but
do
not
look
prepossessing
on
the
stage
they
would
be
set
down
at
once
as
some
old
oriental
band
of
brigands
they
are
however
i
am
told
very
harmless
and
rather
wanting
in
natural
selfassertion
it
was
on
the
dark
side
of
twilight
when
we
got
to
bistritz
which
is
a
very
interesting
old
place
being
practically
on
the
frontierfor
the
borgo
pass
leads
from
it
into
bukovinait
has
had
a
very
stormy
existence
and
it
certainly
shows
marks
of
it
fifty
years
ago
a
series
of
great
fires
took
place
which
made
terrible
havoc
on
five
separate
occasions
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
underwent
a
siege
of
three
weeks
and
lost
13000
people
the
casualties
of
war
proper
being
assisted
by
famine
and
disease
count
dracula
had
directed
me
to
go
to
the
golden
krone
hotel
which
i
found
to
my
great
delight
to
be
thoroughly
oldfashioned
for
of
course
i
wanted
to
see
all
i
could
of
the
ways
of
the
country
i
was
evidently
expected
for
when
i
got
near
the
door
i
faced
a
cheerylooking
elderly
woman
in
the
usual
peasant
dresswhite
undergarment
with
long
double
apron
front
and
back
of
coloured
stuff
fitting
almost
too
tight
for
modesty
when
i
came
close
she
bowed
and
said
the
herr
englishman
yes
i
said
jonathan
harker
she
smiled
and
gave
some
message
to
an
elderly
man
in
white
shirtsleeves
who
had
followed
her
to
the
door
he
went
but
immediately
returned
with
a
letter
my
friendwelcome
to
the
carpathians
i
am
anxiously
expecting
you
sleep
well
tonight
at
three
tomorrow
the
diligence
will
start
for
bukovina
a
place
on
it
is
kept
for
you
at
the
borgo
pass
my
carriage
will
await
you
and
will
bring
you
to
me
i
trust
that
your
journey
from
london
has
been
a
happy
one
and
that
you
will
enjoy
your
stay
in
my
beautiful
land
your
friend
dracula
4
mayi
found
that
my
landlord
had
got
a
letter
from
the
count
directing
him
to
secure
the
best
place
on
the
coach
for
me
but
on
making
inquiries
as
to
details
he
seemed
somewhat
reticent
and
pretended
that
he
could
not
understand
my
german
this
could
not
be
true
because
up
to
then
he
had
understood
it
perfectly
at
least
he
answered
my
questions
exactly
as
if
he
did
he
and
his
wife
the
old
lady
who
had
received
me
looked
at
each
other
in
a
frightened
sort
of
way
he
mumbled
out
that
the
money
had
been
sent
in
a
letter
and
that
was
all
he
knew
when
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
count
dracula
and
could
tell
me
anything
of
his
castle
both
he
and
his
wife
crossed
themselves
and
saying
that
they
knew
nothing
at
all
simply
refused
to
speak
further
it
was
so
near
the
time
of
starting
that
i
had
no
time
to
ask
any
one
else
for
it
was
all
very
mysterious
and
not
by
any
means
comforting
just
before
i
was
leaving
the
old
lady
came
up
to
my
room
and
said
in
a
very
hysterical
way
must
you
go
oh
young
herr
must
you
go
she
was
in
such
an
excited
state
that
she
seemed
to
have
lost
her
grip
of
what
german
she
knew
and
mixed
it
all
up
with
some
other
language
which
i
did
not
know
at
all
i
was
just
able
to
follow
her
by
asking
many
questions
when
i
told
her
that
i
must
go
at
once
and
that
i
was
engaged
on
important
business
she
asked
again
do
you
know
what
day
it
is
i
answered
that
it
was
the
fourth
of
may
she
shook
her
head
as
she
said
again
oh
yes
i
know
that
i
know
that
but
do
you
know
what
day
it
is
on
my
saying
that
i
did
not
understand
she
went
on
it
is
the
eve
of
st
georges
day
do
you
not
know
that
tonight
when
the
clock
strikes
midnight
all
the
evil
things
in
the
world
will
have
full
sway
do
you
know
where
you
are
going
and
what
you
are
going
to
she
was
in
such
evident
distress
that
i
tried
to
comfort
her
but
without
effect
finally
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
implored
me
not
to
go
at
least
to
wait
a
day
or
two
before
starting
it
was
all
very
ridiculous
but
i
did
not
feel
comfortable
however
there
was
business
to
be
done
and
i
could
allow
nothing
to
interfere
with
it
i
therefore
tried
to
raise
her
up
and
said
as
gravely
as
i
could
that
i
thanked
her
but
my
duty
was
imperative
and
that
i
must
go
she
then
rose
and
dried
her
eyes
and
taking
a
crucifix
from
her
neck
offered
it
to
me
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
as
an
english
churchman
i
have
been
taught
to
regard
such
things
as
in
some
measure
idolatrous
and
yet
it
seemed
so
ungracious
to
refuse
an
old
lady
meaning
so
well
and
in
such
a
state
of
mind
she
saw
i
suppose
the
doubt
in
my
face
for
she
put
the
rosary
round
my
neck
and
said
for
your
mothers
sake
and
went
out
of
the
room
i
am
writing
up
this
part
of
the
diary
whilst
i
am
waiting
for
the
coach
which
is
of
course
late
and
the
crucifix
is
still
round
my
neck
whether
it
is
the
old
ladys
fear
or
the
many
ghostly
traditions
of
this
place
or
the
crucifix
itself
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
not
feeling
nearly
as
easy
in
my
mind
as
usual
if
this
book
should
ever
reach
mina
before
i
do
let
it
bring
my
goodbye
here
comes
the
coach





5
may
the
castlethe
grey
of
the
morning
has
passed
and
the
sun
is
high
over
the
distant
horizon
which
seems
jagged
whether
with
trees
or
hills
i
know
not
for
it
is
so
far
off
that
big
things
and
little
are
mixed
i
am
not
sleepy
and
as
i
am
not
to
be
called
till
i
awake
naturally
i
write
till
sleep
comes
there
are
many
odd
things
to
put
down
and
lest
who
reads
them
may
fancy
that
i
dined
too
well
before
i
left
bistritz
let
me
put
down
my
dinner
exactly
i
dined
on
what
they
called
robber
steakbits
of
bacon
onion
and
beef
seasoned
with
red
pepper
and
strung
on
sticks
and
roasted
over
the
fire
in
the
simple
style
of
the
london
cats
meat
the
wine
was
golden
mediasch
which
produces
a
queer
sting
on
the
tongue
which
is
however
not
disagreeable
i
had
only
a
couple
of
glasses
of
this
and
nothing
else
when
i
got
on
the
coach
the
driver
had
not
taken
his
seat
and
i
saw
him
talking
with
the
landlady
they
were
evidently
talking
of
me
for
every
now
and
then
they
looked
at
me
and
some
of
the
people
who
were
sitting
on
the
bench
outside
the
doorwhich
they
call
by
a
name
meaning
wordbearercame
and
listened
and
then
looked
at
me
most
of
them
pityingly
i
could
hear
a
lot
of
words
often
repeated
queer
words
for
there
were
many
nationalities
in
the
crowd
so
i
quietly
got
my
polyglot
dictionary
from
my
bag
and
looked
them
out
i
must
say
they
were
not
cheering
to
me
for
amongst
them
were
ordogsatan
pokolhell
stregoicawitch
vrolok
and
vlkoslakboth
of
which
mean
the
same
thing
one
being
slovak
and
the
other
servian
for
something
that
is
either
werewolf
or
vampire
mem
i
must
ask
the
count
about
these
superstitions
when
we
started
the
crowd
round
the
inn
door
which
had
by
this
time
swelled
to
a
considerable
size
all
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
pointed
two
fingers
towards
me
with
some
difficulty
i
got
a
fellowpassenger
to
tell
me
what
they
meant
he
would
not
answer
at
first
but
on
learning
that
i
was
english
he
explained
that
it
was
a
charm
or
guard
against
the
evil
eye
this
was
not
very
pleasant
for
me
just
starting
for
an
unknown
place
to
meet
an
unknown
man
but
every
one
seemed
so
kindhearted
and
so
sorrowful
and
so
sympathetic
that
i
could
not
but
be
touched
i
shall
never
forget
the
last
glimpse
which
i
had
of
the
innyard
and
its
crowd
of
picturesque
figures
all
crossing
themselves
as
they
stood
round
the
wide
archway
with
its
background
of
rich
foliage
of
oleander
and
orange
trees
in
green
tubs
clustered
in
the
centre
of
the
yard
then
our
driver
whose
wide
linen
drawers
covered
the
whole
front
of
the
boxseatgotza
they
call
themcracked
his
big
whip
over
his
four
small
horses
which
ran
abreast
and
we
set
off
on
our
journey
i
soon
lost
sight
and
recollection
of
ghostly
fears
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
as
we
drove
along
although
had
i
known
the
language
or
rather
languages
which
my
fellowpassengers
were
speaking
i
might
not
have
been
able
to
throw
them
off
so
easily
before
us
lay
a
green
sloping
land
full
of
forests
and
woods
with
here
and
there
steep
hills
crowned
with
clumps
of
trees
or
with
farmhouses
the
blank
gable
end
to
the
road
there
was
everywhere
a
bewildering
mass
of
fruit
blossomapple
plum
pear
cherry
and
as
we
drove
by
i
could
see
the
green
grass
under
the
trees
spangled
with
the
fallen
petals
in
and
out
amongst
these
green
hills
of
what
they
call
here
the
mittel
land
ran
the
road
losing
itself
as
it
swept
round
the
grassy
curve
or
was
shut
out
by
the
straggling
ends
of
pine
woods
which
here
and
there
ran
down
the
hillsides
like
tongues
of
flame
the
road
was
rugged
but
still
we
seemed
to
fly
over
it
with
a
feverish
haste
i
could
not
understand
then
what
the
haste
meant
but
the
driver
was
evidently
bent
on
losing
no
time
in
reaching
borgo
prund
i
was
told
that
this
road
is
in
summertime
excellent
but
that
it
had
not
yet
been
put
in
order
after
the
winter
snows
in
this
respect
it
is
different
from
the
general
run
of
roads
in
the
carpathians
for
it
is
an
old
tradition
that
they
are
not
to
be
kept
in
too
good
order
of
old
the
hospadars
would
not
repair
them
lest
the
turk
should
think
that
they
were
preparing
to
bring
in
foreign
troops
and
so
hasten
the
war
which
was
always
really
at
loading
point
beyond
the
green
swelling
hills
of
the
mittel
land
rose
mighty
slopes
of
forest
up
to
the
lofty
steeps
of
the
carpathians
themselves
right
and
left
of
us
they
towered
with
the
afternoon
sun
falling
full
upon
them
and
bringing
out
all
the
glorious
colours
of
this
beautiful
range
deep
blue
and
purple
in
the
shadows
of
the
peaks
green
and
brown
where
grass
and
rock
mingled
and
an
endless
perspective
of
jagged
rock
and
pointed
crags
till
these
were
themselves
lost
in
the
distance
where
the
snowy
peaks
rose
grandly
here
and
there
seemed
mighty
rifts
in
the
mountains
through
which
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
we
saw
now
and
again
the
white
gleam
of
falling
water
one
of
my
companions
touched
my
arm
as
we
swept
round
the
base
of
a
hill
and
opened
up
the
lofty
snowcovered
peak
of
a
mountain
which
seemed
as
we
wound
on
our
serpentine
way
to
be
right
before
us
look
isten
szekgods
seatand
he
crossed
himself
reverently
as
we
wound
on
our
endless
way
and
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
behind
us
the
shadows
of
the
evening
began
to
creep
round
us
this
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
the
snowy
mountaintop
still
held
the
sunset
and
seemed
to
glow
out
with
a
delicate
cool
pink
here
and
there
we
passed
cszeks
and
slovaks
all
in
picturesque
attire
but
i
noticed
that
goitre
was
painfully
prevalent
by
the
roadside
were
many
crosses
and
as
we
swept
by
my
companions
all
crossed
themselves
here
and
there
was
a
peasant
man
or
woman
kneeling
before
a
shrine
who
did
not
even
turn
round
as
we
approached
but
seemed
in
the
selfsurrender
of
devotion
to
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
the
outer
world
there
were
many
things
new
to
me
for
instance
hayricks
in
the
trees
and
here
and
there
very
beautiful
masses
of
weeping
birch
their
white
stems
shining
like
silver
through
the
delicate
green
of
the
leaves
now
and
again
we
passed
a
leiterwagonthe
ordinary
peasants
cartwith
its
long
snakelike
vertebra
calculated
to
suit
the
inequalities
of
the
road
on
this
were
sure
to
be
seated
quite
a
group
of
homecoming
peasants
the
cszeks
with
their
white
and
the
slovaks
with
their
coloured
sheepskins
the
latter
carrying
lancefashion
their
long
staves
with
axe
at
end
as
the
evening
fell
it
began
to
get
very
cold
and
the
growing
twilight
seemed
to
merge
into
one
dark
mistiness
the
gloom
of
the
trees
oak
beech
and
pine
though
in
the
valleys
which
ran
deep
between
the
spurs
of
the
hills
as
we
ascended
through
the
pass
the
dark
firs
stood
out
here
and
there
against
the
background
of
latelying
snow
sometimes
as
the
road
was
cut
through
the
pine
woods
that
seemed
in
the
darkness
to
be
closing
down
upon
us
great
masses
of
greyness
which
here
and
there
bestrewed
the
trees
produced
a
peculiarly
weird
and
solemn
effect
which
carried
on
the
thoughts
and
grim
fancies
engendered
earlier
in
the
evening
when
the
falling
sunset
threw
into
strange
relief
the
ghostlike
clouds
which
amongst
the
carpathians
seem
to
wind
ceaselessly
through
the
valleys
sometimes
the
hills
were
so
steep
that
despite
our
drivers
haste
the
horses
could
only
go
slowly
i
wished
to
get
down
and
walk
up
them
as
we
do
at
home
but
the
driver
would
not
hear
of
it
no
no
he
said
you
must
not
walk
here
the
dogs
are
too
fierce
and
then
he
added
with
what
he
evidently
meant
for
grim
pleasantryfor
he
looked
round
to
catch
the
approving
smile
of
the
restand
you
may
have
enough
of
such
matters
before
you
go
to
sleep
the
only
stop
he
would
make
was
a
moments
pause
to
light
his
lamps
when
it
grew
dark
there
seemed
to
be
some
excitement
amongst
the
passengers
and
they
kept
speaking
to
him
one
after
the
other
as
though
urging
him
to
further
speed
he
lashed
the
horses
unmercifully
with
his
long
whip
and
with
wild
cries
of
encouragement
urged
them
on
to
further
exertions
then
through
the
darkness
i
could
see
a
sort
of
patch
of
grey
light
ahead
of
us
as
though
there
were
a
cleft
in
the
hills
the
excitement
of
the
passengers
grew
greater
the
crazy
coach
rocked
on
its
great
leather
springs
and
swayed
like
a
boat
tossed
on
a
stormy
sea
i
had
to
hold
on
the
road
grew
more
level
and
we
appeared
to
fly
along
then
the
mountains
seemed
to
come
nearer
to
us
on
each
side
and
to
frown
down
upon
us
we
were
entering
on
the
borgo
pass
one
by
one
several
of
the
passengers
offered
me
gifts
which
they
pressed
upon
me
with
an
earnestness
which
would
take
no
denial
these
were
certainly
of
an
odd
and
varied
kind
but
each
was
given
in
simple
good
faith
with
a
kindly
word
and
a
blessing
and
that
strange
mixture
of
fearmeaning
movements
which
i
had
seen
outside
the
hotel
at
bistritzthe
sign
of
the
cross
and
the
guard
against
the
evil
eye
then
as
we
flew
along
the
driver
leaned
forward
and
on
each
side
the
passengers
craning
over
the
edge
of
the
coach
peered
eagerly
into
the
darkness
it
was
evident
that
something
very
exciting
was
either
happening
or
expected
but
though
i
asked
each
passenger
no
one
would
give
me
the
slightest
explanation
this
state
of
excitement
kept
on
for
some
little
time
and
at
last
we
saw
before
us
the
pass
opening
out
on
the
eastern
side
there
were
dark
rolling
clouds
overhead
and
in
the
air
the
heavy
oppressive
sense
of
thunder
it
seemed
as
though
the
mountain
range
had
separated
two
atmospheres
and
that
now
we
had
got
into
the
thunderous
one
i
was
now
myself
looking
out
for
the
conveyance
which
was
to
take
me
to
the
count
each
moment
i
expected
to
see
the
glare
of
lamps
through
the
blackness
but
all
was
dark
the
only
light
was
the
flickering
rays
of
our
own
lamps
in
which
the
steam
from
our
harddriven
horses
rose
in
a
white
cloud
we
could
see
now
the
sandy
road
lying
white
before
us
but
there
was
on
it
no
sign
of
a
vehicle
the
passengers
drew
back
with
a
sigh
of
gladness
which
seemed
to
mock
my
own
disappointment
i
was
already
thinking
what
i
had
best
do
when
the
driver
looking
at
his
watch
said
to
the
others
something
which
i
could
hardly
hear
it
was
spoken
so
quietly
and
in
so
low
a
tone
i
thought
it
was
an
hour
less
than
the
time
then
turning
to
me
he

whilst
he
was
speaking
the
horses
began
to
neigh
and
snort
and
plunge
wildly
so
that
the
driver
had
to
hold
them
up
then
amongst
a
chorus
of
screams
from
the
peasants
and
a
universal
crossing
of
themselves
a
calche
with
four
horses
drove
up
behind
us
overtook
us
and
drew
up
beside
the
coach
i
could
see
from
the
flash
of
our
lamps
as
the
rays
fell
on
them
that
the
horses
were
coalblack
and
splendid
animals
they
were
driven
by
a
tall
man
with
a
long
brown
beard
and
a
great
black
hat
which
seemed
to
hide
his
face
from
us
i
could
only
see
the
gleam
of
a
pair
of
very
bright
eyes
which
seemed
red
in
the
lamplight
as
he
turned
to
us
he
said
to
the
driver
you
are
early
tonight
my
friend
the
man
stammered
in
reply
the
english
herr
was
in
a
hurry
to
which
the
stranger
replied
that
is
why
i
suppose
you
wished
him
to
go
on
to
bukovina
you
cannot
deceive
me
my
friend
i
know
too
much
and
my
horses
are
swift
as
he
spoke
he
smiled
and
the
lamplight
fell
on
a
hardlooking
mouth
with
very
red
lips
and
sharplooking
teeth
as
white
as
ivory
one
of
my
companions
whispered
to
another
the
line
from
burgers
lenore
denn

for
the
dead

the
strange
driver
evidently
heard
the
words
for
he
looked
up
with
a
gleaming
smile
the
passenger
turned
his
face
away
at
the
same
time
putting
out
his
two
fingers
and
crossing
himself
give
me
the
herrs
luggage
said
the
driver
and
with
exceeding
alacrity
my
bags
were
handed
out
and
put
in
the
calche
then
i
descended
from
the
side
of
the
coach
as
the
calche
was
close
alongside
the
driver
helping
me
with
a
hand
which
caught
my
arm
in
a
grip
of
steel
his
strength
must
have
been
prodigious
without
a
word
he
shook
his
reins
the
horses
turned
and
we
swept
into
the
darkness
of
the
pass
as
i
looked
back
i
saw
the
steam
from
the
horses
of
the
coach
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
and
projected
against
it
the
figures
of
my
late
companions
crossing
themselves
then
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
and
called
to
his
horses
and
off
they
swept
on
their
way
to
bukovina
as
they
sank
into
the
darkness
i
felt
a
strange
chill
and
a
lonely
feeling
came
over
me
but
a
cloak
was
thrown
over
my
shoulders
and
a
rug
across
my
knees
and
the
driver
said
in
excellent
german
the
night
is
chill
mein
herr
and
my
master
the
count
bade
me
take
all
care
of
you
there
is
a
flask
of
slivovitz
the
plum
brandy
of
the
country
underneath
the
seat
if
you
should
require
it
i
did
not
take
any
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
know
it
was
there
all
the
same
i
felt
a
little
strangely
and
not
a
little
frightened
i
think
had
there
been
any
alternative
i
should
have
taken
it
instead
of
prosecuting
that
unknown
night
journey
the
carriage
went
at
a
hard
pace
straight
along
then
we
made
a
complete
turn
and
went
along
another
straight
road
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
simply
going
over
and
over
the
same
ground
again
and
so
i
took
note
of
some
salient
point
and
found
that
this
was
so
i
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
the
driver
what
this
all
meant
but
i
really
feared
to
do
so
for
i
thought
that
placed
as
i
was
any
protest
would
have
had
no
effect
in
case
there
had
been
an
intention
to
delay
byandby
however
as
i
was
curious
to
know
how
time
was
passing
i
struck
a
match
and
by
its
flame
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
midnight
this
gave
me
a
sort
of
shock
for
i
suppose
the
general
superstition
about
midnight
was
increased
by
my
recent
experiences
i
waited
with
a
sick
feeling
of
suspense
then
a
dog
began
to
howl
somewhere
in
a
farmhouse
far
down
the
roada
long
agonised
wailing
as
if
from
fear
the
sound
was
taken
up
by
another
dog
and
then
another
and
another
till
borne
on
the
wind
which
now
sighed
softly
through
the
pass
a
wild
howling
began
which
seemed
to
come
from
all
over
the
country
as
far
as
the
imagination
could
grasp
it
through
the
gloom
of
the
night
at
the
first
howl
the
horses
began
to
strain
and
rear
but
the
driver
spoke
to
them
soothingly
and
they
quieted
down
but
shivered
and
sweated
as
though
after
a
runaway
from
sudden
fright
then
far
off
in
the
distance
from
the
mountains
on
each
side
of
us
began
a
louder
and
a
sharper
howlingthat
of
wolveswhich
affected
both
the
horses
and
myself
in
the
same
wayfor
i
was
minded
to
jump
from
the
calche
and
run
whilst
they
reared
again
and
plunged
madly
so
that
the
driver
had
to
use
all
his
great
strength
to
keep
them
from
bolting
in
a
few
minutes
however
my
own
ears
got
accustomed
to
the
sound
and
the
horses
so
far
became
quiet
that
the
driver
was
able
to
descend
and
to
stand
before
them
he
petted
and
soothed
them
and
whispered
something
in
their
ears
as
i
have
heard
of
horsetamers
doing
and
with
extraordinary
effect
for
under
his
caresses
they
became
quite
manageable
again
though
they
still
trembled
the
driver
again
took
his
seat
and
shaking
his
reins
started
off
at
a
great
pace
this
time
after
going
to
the
far
side
of
the
pass
he
suddenly
turned
down
a
narrow
roadway
which
ran
sharply
to
the
right
soon
we
were
hemmed
in
with
trees
which
in
places
arched
right
over
the
roadway
till
we
passed
as
through
a
tunnel
and
again
great
frowning
rocks
guarded
us
boldly
on
either
side
though
we
were
in
shelter
we
could
hear
the
rising
wind
for
it
moaned
and
whistled
through
the
rocks
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
crashed
together
as
we
swept
along
it
grew
colder
and
colder
still
and
fine
powdery
snow
began
to
fall
so
that
soon
we
and
all
around
us
were
covered
with
a
white
blanket
the
keen
wind
still
carried
the
howling
of
the
dogs
though
this
grew
fainter
as
we
went
on
our
way
the
baying
of
the
wolves
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
as
though
they
were
closing
round
on
us
from
every
side
i
grew
dreadfully
afraid
and
the
horses
shared
my
fear
the
driver
however
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
he
kept
turning
his
head
to
left
and
right
but
i
could
not
see
anything
through
the
darkness
suddenly
away
on
our
left
i
saw
a
faint
flickering
blue
flame
the
driver
saw
it
at
the
same
moment
he
at
once
checked
the
horses
and
jumping
to
the
ground
disappeared
into
the
darkness
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
less
as
the
howling
of
the
wolves
grew
closer
but
while
i
wondered
the
driver
suddenly
appeared
again
and
without
a
word
took
his
seat
and
we
resumed
our
journey
i
think
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
and
kept
dreaming
of
the
incident
for
it
seemed
to
be
repeated
endlessly
and
now
looking
back
it
is
like
a
sort
of
awful
nightmare
once
the
flame
appeared
so
near
the
road
that
even
in
the
darkness
around
us
i
could
watch
the
drivers
motions
he
went
rapidly
to
where
the
blue
flame
aroseit
must
have
been
very
faint
for
it
did
not
seem
to
illumine
the
place
around
it
at
alland
gathering
a
few
stones
formed
them
into
some
device
once
there
appeared
a
strange
optical
effect
when
he
stood
between
me
and
the
flame
he
did
not
obstruct
it
for
i
could
see
its
ghostly
flicker
all
the
same
this
startled
me
but
as
the
effect
was
only
momentary
i
took
it
that
my
eyes
deceived
me
straining
through
the
darkness
then
for
a
time
there
were
no
blue
flames
and
we
sped
onwards
through
the
gloom
with
the
howling
of
the
wolves
around
us
as
though
they
were
following
in
a
moving
circle
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
the
driver
went
further
afield
than
he
had
yet
gone
and
during
his
absence
the
horses
began
to
tremble
worse
than
ever
and
to
snort
and
scream
with
fright
i
could
not
see
any
cause
for
it
for
the
howling
of
the
wolves
had
ceased
altogether
but
just
then
the
moon
sailing
through
the
black
clouds
appeared
behind
the
jagged
crest
of
a
beetling
pineclad
rock
and
by
its
light
i
saw
around
us
a
ring
of
wolves
with
white
teeth
and
lolling
red
tongues
with
long
sinewy
limbs
and
shaggy
hair
they
were
a
hundred
times
more
terrible
in
the
grim
silence
which
held
them
than
even
when
they
howled
for
myself
i
felt
a
sort
of
paralysis
of
fear
it
is
only
when
a
man
feels
himself
face
to
face
with
such
horrors
that
he
can
understand
their
true
import
all
at
once
the
wolves
began
to
howl
as
though
the
moonlight
had
had
some
peculiar
effect
on
them
the
horses
jumped
about
and
reared
and
looked
helplessly
round
with
eyes
that
rolled
in
a
way
painful
to
see
but
the
living
ring
of
terror
encompassed
them
on
every
side
and
they
had
perforce
to
remain
within
it
i
called
to
the
coachman
to
come
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
only
chance
was
to
try
to
break
out
through
the
ring
and
to
aid
his
approach
i
shouted
and
beat
the
side
of
the
calche
hoping
by
the
noise
to
scare
the
wolves
from
that
side
so
as
to
give
him
a
chance
of
reaching
the
trap
how
he
came
there
i
know
not
but
i
heard
his
voice
raised
in
a
tone
of
imperious
command
and
looking
towards
the
sound
saw
him
stand
in
the
roadway
as
he
swept
his
long
arms
as
though
brushing
aside
some
impalpable
obstacle
the
wolves
fell
back
and
back
further
still
just
then
a
heavy
cloud
passed
across
the
face
of
the
moon
so
that
we
were
again
in
darkness
when
i
could
see
again
the
driver
was
climbing
into
the
calche
and
the
wolves
had
disappeared
this
was
all
so
strange
and
uncanny
that
a
dreadful
fear
came
upon
me
and
i
was
afraid
to
speak
or
move
the
time
seemed
interminable
as
we
swept
on
our
way
now
in
almost
complete
darkness
for
the
rolling
clouds
obscured
the
moon
we
kept
on
ascending
with
occasional
periods
of
quick
descent
but
in
the
main
always
ascending
suddenly
i
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
driver
was
in
the
act
of
pulling
up
the
horses
in
the
courtyard
of
a
vast
ruined
castle
from
whose
tall
black
windows
came
no
ray
of
light
and
whose
broken
battlements
showed
a
jagged
line
against
the
moonlit
sky

mayi
must
have
been
asleep
for
certainly
if
i
had
been
fully
awake
i
must
have
noticed
the
approach
of
such
a
remarkable
place
in
the
gloom
the
courtyard
looked
of
considerable
size
and
as
several
dark
ways
led
from
it
under
great
round
arches
it
perhaps
seemed
bigger
than
it
really
is
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
see
it
by
daylight
when
the
calche
stopped
the
driver
jumped
down
and
held
out
his
hand
to
assist
me
to
alight
again
i
could
not
but
notice
his
prodigious
strength
his
hand
actually
seemed
like
a
steel
vice
that
could
have
crushed
mine
if
he
had
chosen
then
he
took
out
my
traps
and
placed
them
on
the
ground
beside
me
as
i
stood
close
to
a
great
door
old
and
studded
with
large
iron
nails
and
set
in
a
projecting
doorway
of
massive
stone
i
could
see
even
in
the
dim
light
that
the
stone
was
massively
carved
but
that
the
carving
had
been
much
worn
by
time
and
weather
as
i
stood
the
driver
jumped
again
into
his
seat
and
shook
the
reins
the
horses
started
forward
and
trap
and
all
disappeared
down
one
of
the
dark
openings
i
stood
in
silence
where
i
was
for
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
of
bell
or
knocker
there
was
no
sign
through
these
frowning
walls
and
dark
window
openings
it
was
not
likely
that
my
voice
could
penetrate
the
time
i
waited
seemed
endless
and
i
felt
doubts
and
fears
crowding
upon
me
what
sort
of
place
had
i
come
to
and
among
what
kind
of
people
what
sort
of
grim
adventure
was
it
on
which
i
had
embarked
was
this
a
customary
incident
in
the
life
of
a
solicitors
clerk
sent
out
to
explain
the
purchase
of
a
london
estate
to
a
foreigner
solicitors
clerk
mina
would
not
like
that
solicitorfor
just
before
leaving
london
i
got
word
that
my
examination
was
successful
and
i
am
now
a
fullblown
solicitor
i
began
to
rub
my
eyes
and
pinch
myself
to
see
if
i
were
awake
it
all
seemed
like
a
horrible
nightmare
to
me
and
i
expected
that
i
should
suddenly
awake
and
find
myself
at
home
with
the
dawn
struggling
in
through
the
windows
as
i
had
now
and
again
felt
in
the
morning
after
a
day
of
overwork
but
my
flesh
answered
the
pinching
test
and
my
eyes
were
not
to
be
deceived
i
was
indeed
awake
and
among
the
carpathians
all
i
could
do
now
was
to
be
patient
and
to
wait
the
coming
of
the
morning
just
as
i
had
come
to
this
conclusion
i
heard
a
heavy
step
approaching
behind
the
great
door
and
saw
through
the
chinks
the
gleam
of
a
coming
light
then
there
was
the
sound
of
rattling
chains
and
the
clanking
of
massive
bolts
drawn
back
a
key
was
turned
with
the
loud
grating
noise
of
long
disuse
and
the
great
door
swung
back
within
stood
a
tall
old
man
clean
shaven
save
for
a
long
white
moustache
and
clad
in
black
from
head
to
foot
without
a
single
speck
of
colour
about
him
anywhere
he
held
in
his
hand
an
antique
silver
lamp
in
which
the
flame
burned
without
chimney
or
globe
of
any
kind
throwing
long
quivering
shadows
as
it
flickered
in
the
draught
of
the
open
door
the
old
man
motioned
me
in
with
his
right
hand
with
a
courtly
gesture
saying
in
excellent
english
but
with
a
strange
intonation
welcome
to
my
house
enter
freely
and
of
your
own
will
he
made
no
motion
of
stepping
to
meet
me
but
stood
like
a
statue
as
though
his
gesture
of
welcome
had
fixed
him
into
stone
the
instant
however
that
i
had
stepped
over
the
threshold
he
moved
impulsively
forward
and
holding
out
his
hand
grasped
mine
with
a
strength
which
made
me
wince
an
effect
which
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
it
seemed
as
cold
as
icemore
like
the
hand
of
a
dead
than
a
living
man
again
he
said
welcome
to
my
house
come
freely
go
safely
and
leave
something
of
the
happiness
you
bring
the
strength
of
the
handshake
was
so
much
akin
to
that
which
i
had
noticed
in
the
driver
whose
face
i
had
not
seen
that
for
a
moment
i
doubted
if
it
were
not
the
same
person
to
whom
i
was
speaking
so
to
make
sure
i
said
interrogatively
count
dracula
he
bowed
in
a
courtly
way
as
he
replied
i
am
dracula
and
i
bid
you
welcome
mr
harker
to
my
house
come
in
the
night
air
is
chill
and
you
must
need
to
eat
and
rest
as
he
was
speaking
he
put
the
lamp
on
a
bracket
on
the
wall
and
stepping
out
took
my
luggage
he
had
carried
it
in
before
i
could
forestall
him
i
protested
but
he
insisted
nay
sir
you
are
my
guest
it
is
late
and
my
people
are
not
available
let
me
see
to
your
comfort
myself
he
insisted
on
carrying
my
traps
along
the
passage
and
then
up
a
great
winding
stair
and
along
another
great
passage
on
whose
stone
floor
our
steps
rang
heavily
at
the
end
of
this
he
threw
open
a
heavy
door
and
i
rejoiced
to
see
within
a
welllit
room
in
which
a
table
was
spread
for
supper
and
on
whose
mighty
hearth
a
great
fire
of
logs
freshly
replenished
flamed
and
flared
the
count
halted
putting
down
my
bags
closed
the
door
and
crossing
the
room
opened
another
door
which
led
into
a
small
octagonal
room
lit
by
a
single
lamp
and
seemingly
without
a
window
of
any
sort
passing
through
this
he
opened
another
door
and
motioned
me
to
enter
it
was
a
welcome
sight
for
here
was
a
great
bedroom
well
lighted
and
warmed
with
another
log
firealso
added
to
but
lately
for
the
top
logs
were
freshwhich
sent
a
hollow
roar
up
the
wide
chimney
the
count
himself
left
my
luggage
inside
and
withdrew
saying
before
he
closed
the
door
you
will
need
after
your
journey
to
refresh
yourself
by
making
your
toilet
i
trust
you
will
find
all
you
wish
when
you
are
ready
come
into
the
other
room
where
you
will
find
your
supper
prepared
the
light
and
warmth
and
the
counts
courteous
welcome
seemed
to
have
dissipated
all
my
doubts
and
fears
having
then
reached
my
normal
state
i
discovered
that
i
was
half
famished
with
hunger
so
making
a
hasty
toilet
i
went
into
the
other
room
i
found
supper
already
laid
out
my
host
who
stood
on
one
side
of
the
great
fireplace
leaning
against
the
stonework
made
a
graceful
wave
of
his
hand
to
the
table
and
said
i
pray
you
be
seated
and
sup
how
you
please
you
will
i
trust
excuse
me
that
i
do
not
join
you
but
i
have
dined
already
and
i
do
not
sup
i
handed
to
him
the
sealed
letter
which
mr
hawkins
had
entrusted
to
me
he
opened
it
and
read
it
gravely
then
with
a
charming
smile
he
handed
it
to
me
to
read
one
passage
of
it
at
least
gave
me
a
thrill
of
pleasure
i
must
regret
that
an
attack
of
gout
from
which
malady
i
am
a
constant
sufferer
forbids
absolutely
any
travelling
on
my
part
for
some
time
to
come
but
i
am
happy
to
say
i
can
send
a
sufficient
substitute
one
in
whom
i
have
every
possible
confidence
he
is
a
young
man
full
of
energy
and
talent
in
his
own
way
and
of
a
very
faithful
disposition
he
is
discreet
and
silent
and
has
grown
into
manhood
in
my
service
he
shall
be
ready
to
attend
on
you
when
you
will
during
his
stay
and
shall
take
your
instructions
in
all
matters
the
count
himself
came
forward
and
took
off
the
cover
of
a
dish
and
i
fell
to
at
once
on
an
excellent
roast
chicken
this
with
some
cheese
and
a
salad
and
a
bottle
of
old
tokay
of
which
i
had
two
glasses
was
my
supper
during
the
time
i
was
eating
it
the
count
asked
me
many
questions
as
to
my
journey
and
i
told
him
by
degrees
all
i
had
experienced
by
this
time
i
had
finished
my
supper
and
by
my
hosts
desire
had
drawn
up
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
begun
to
smoke
a
cigar
which
he
offered
me
at
the
same
time
excusing
himself
that
he
did
not
smoke
i
had
now
an
opportunity
of
observing
him
and
found
him
of
a
very
marked
physiognomy
his
face
was
a
stronga
very
strongaquiline
with
high
bridge
of
the
thin
nose
and
peculiarly
arched
nostrils
with
lofty
domed
forehead
and
hair
growing
scantily
round
the
temples
but
profusely
elsewhere
his
eyebrows
were
very
massive
almost
meeting
over
the
nose
and
with
bushy
hair
that
seemed
to
curl
in
its
own
profusion
the
mouth
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
under
the
heavy
moustache
was
fixed
and
rather
cruellooking
with
peculiarly
sharp
white
teeth
these
protruded
over
the
lips
whose
remarkable
ruddiness
showed
astonishing
vitality
in
a
man
of
his
years
for
the
rest
his
ears
were
pale
and
at
the
tops
extremely
pointed
the
chin
was
broad
and
strong
and
the
cheeks
firm
though
thin
the
general
effect
was
one
of
extraordinary
pallor
hitherto
i
had
noticed
the
backs
of
his
hands
as
they
lay
on
his
knees
in
the
firelight
and
they
had
seemed
rather
white
and
fine
but
seeing
them
now
close
to
me
i
could
not
but
notice
that
they
were
rather
coarsebroad
with
squat
fingers
strange
to
say
there
were
hairs
in
the
centre
of
the
palm
the
nails
were
long
and
fine
and
cut
to
a
sharp
point
as
the
count
leaned
over
me
and
his
hands
touched
me
i
could
not
repress
a
shudder
it
may
have
been
that
his
breath
was
rank
but
a
horrible
feeling
of
nausea
came
over
me
which
do
what
i
would
i
could
not
conceal
the
count
evidently
noticing
it
drew
back
and
with
a
grim
sort
of
smile
which
showed
more
than
he
had
yet
done
his
protuberant
teeth
sat
himself
down
again
on
his
own
side
of
the
fireplace
we
were
both
silent
for
a
while
and
as
i
looked
towards
the
window
i
saw
the
first
dim
streak
of
the
coming
dawn
there
seemed
a
strange
stillness
over
everything
but
as
i
listened
i
heard
as
if
from
down
below
in
the
valley
the
howling
of
many
wolves
the
counts
eyes
gleamed
and
he
said
listen
to
themthe
children
of
the
night
what
music
they
make
seeing
i
suppose
some
expression
in
my
face
strange
to
him
he
added
ah
sir
you
dwellers
in
the
city
cannot
enter
into
the
feelings
of
the
hunter
then
he
rose
and
said
but
you
must
be
tired
your
bedroom
is
all
ready
and
tomorrow
you
shall
sleep
as
late
as
you
will
i
have
to
be
away
till
the
afternoon
so
sleep
well
and
dream
well
with
a
courteous
bow
he
opened
for
me
himself
the
door
to
the
octagonal
room
and
i
entered
my
bedroom
i
am
all
in
a
sea
of
wonders
i
doubt
i
fear
i
think
strange
things
which
i
dare
not
confess
to
my
own
soul
god
keep
me
if
only
for
the
sake
of
those
dear
to
me





7
mayit
is
again
early
morning
but
i
have
rested
and
enjoyed
the
last
twentyfour
hours
i
slept
till
late
in
the
day
and
awoke
of
my
own
accord
when
i
had
dressed
myself
i
went
into
the
room
where
we
had
supped
and
found
a
cold
breakfast
laid
out
with
coffee
kept
hot
by
the
pot
being
placed
on
the
hearth
there
was
a
card
on
the
table
on
which
was
written
i
have
to
be
absent
for
a
while
do
not
wait
for
med
i
set
to
and
enjoyed
a
hearty
meal
when
i
had
done
i
looked
for
a
bell
so
that
i
might
let
the
servants
know
i
had
finished
but
i
could
not
find
one
there
are
certainly
odd
deficiencies
in
the
house
considering
the
extraordinary
evidences
of
wealth
which
are
round
me
the
table
service
is
of
gold
and
so
beautifully
wrought
that
it
must
be
of
immense
value
the
curtains
and
upholstery
of
the
chairs
and
sofas
and
the
hangings
of
my
bed
are
of
the
costliest
and
most
beautiful
fabrics
and
must
have
been
of
fabulous
value
when
they
were
made
for
they
are
centuries
old
though
in
excellent
order
i
saw
something
like
them
in
hampton
court
but
there
they
were
worn
and
frayed
and
motheaten
but
still
in
none
of
the
rooms
is
there
a
mirror
there
is
not
even
a
toilet
glass
on
my
table
and
i
had
to
get
the
little
shaving
glass
from
my
bag
before
i
could
either
shave
or
brush
my
hair
i
have
not
yet
seen
a
servant
anywhere
or
heard
a
sound
near
the
castle
except
the
howling
of
wolves
some
time
after
i
had
finished
my
meali
do
not
know
whether
to
call
it
breakfast
or
dinner
for
it
was
between
five
and
six
oclock
when
i
had
iti
looked
about
for
something
to
read
for
i
did
not
like
to
go
about
the
castle
until
i
had
asked
the
counts
permission
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
room
book
newspaper
or
even
writing
materials
so
i
opened
another
door
in
the
room
and
found
a
sort
of
library
the
door
opposite
mine
i
tried
but
found
it
locked
in
the
library
i
found
to
my
great
delight
a
vast
number
of
english
books
whole
shelves
full
of
them
and
bound
volumes
of
magazines
and
newspapers
a
table
in
the
centre
was
littered
with
english
magazines
and
newspapers
though
none
of
them
were
of
very
recent
date
the
books
were
of
the
most
varied
kindhistory
geography
politics
political
economy
botany
geology
lawall
relating
to
england
and
english
life
and
customs
and
manners
there
were
even
such
books
of
reference
as
the
london
directory
the
red
and
blue
books
whitakers
almanac
the
army
and
navy
lists
andit
somehow
gladdened
my
heart
to
see
itthe
law
list
whilst
i
was
looking
at
the
books
the
door
opened
and
the
count
entered
he
saluted
me
in
a
hearty
way
and
hoped
that
i
had
had
a
good
nights
rest
then
he
went
on
i
am
glad
you
found
your
way
in
here
for
i
am
sure
there
is
much
that
will
interest
you
these
companionsand
he
laid
his
hand
on
some
of
the
bookshave
been
good
friends
to
me
and
for
some
years
past
ever
since
i
had
the
idea
of
going
to
london
have
given
me
many
many
hours
of
pleasure
through
them
i
have
come
to
know
your
great
england
and
to
know
her
is
to
love
her
i
long
to
go
through
the
crowded
streets
of
your
mighty
london
to
be
in
the
midst
of
the
whirl
and
rush
of
humanity
to
share
its
life
its
change
its
death
and
all
that
makes
it
what
it
is
but
alas
as
yet
i
only
know
your
tongue
through
books
to
you
my
friend
i
look
that
i
know
it
to
speak
but
count
i
said
you
know
and
speak
english
thoroughly
he
bowed
gravely
i
thank
you
my
friend
for
your
all
tooflattering
estimate
but
yet
i
fear
that
i
am
but
a
little
way
on
the
road
i
would
travel
true
i
know
the
grammar
and
the
words
but
yet
i
know
not
how
to
speak
them
indeed
i
said
you
speak
excellently
not
so
he
answered
well
i
know
that
did
i
move
and
speak
in
your
london
none
there
are
who
would
not
know
me
for
a
stranger
that
is
not
enough
for
me
here
i
am
noble
i
am
boyar
the
common
people
know
me
and
i
am
master
but
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
he
is
no
one
men
know
him
notand
to
know
not
is
to
care
not
for
i
am
content
if
i
am
like
the
rest
so
that
no
man
stops
if
he
see
me
or
pause
in
his
speaking
if
he
hear
my
words
ha
ha
a
stranger
i
have
been
so
long
master
that
i
would
be
master
stillor
at
least
that
none
other
should
be
master
of
me
you
come
to
me
not
alone
as
agent
of
my
friend
peter
hawkins
of
exeter
to
tell
me
all
about
my
new
estate
in
london
you
shall
i
trust
rest
here
with
me
awhile
so
that
by
our
talking
i
may
learn
the
english
intonation
and
i
would
that
you
tell
me
when
i
make
error
even
of
the
smallest
in
my
speaking
i
am
sorry
that
i
had
to
be
away
so
long
today
but
you
will
i
know
forgive
one
who
has
so
many
important
affairs
in
hand
of
course
i
said
all
i
could
about
being
willing
and
asked
if
i
might
come
into
that
room
when
i
chose
he
answered
yes
certainly
and
added
you
may
go
anywhere
you
wish
in
the
castle
except
where
the
doors
are
locked
where
of
course
you
will
not
wish
to
go
there
is
reason
that
all
things
are
as
they
are
and
did
you
see
with
my
eyes
and
know
with
my
knowledge
you
would
perhaps
better
understand
i
said
i
was
sure
of
this
and
then
he
went
on
we
are
in
transylvania
and
transylvania
is
not
england
our
ways
are
not
your
ways
and
there
shall
be
to
you
many
strange
things
nay
from
what
you
have
told
me
of
your
experiences
already
you
know
something
of
what
strange
things
there
may
be
this
led
to
much
conversation
and
as
it
was
evident
that
he
wanted
to
talk
if
only
for
talkings
sake
i
asked
him
many
questions
regarding
things
that
had
already
happened
to
me
or
come
within
my
notice
sometimes
he
sheered
off
the
subject
or
turned
the
conversation
by
pretending
not
to
understand
but
generally
he
answered
all
i
asked
most
frankly
then
as
time
went
on
and
i
had
got
somewhat
bolder
i
asked
him
of
some
of
the
strange
things
of
the
preceding
night
as
for
instance
why
the
coachman
went
to
the
places
where
he
had
seen
the
blue
flames
he
then
explained
to
me
that
it
was
commonly
believed
that
on
a
certain
night
of
the
yearlast
night
in
fact
when
all
evil
spirits
are
supposed
to
have
unchecked
swaya
blue
flame
is
seen
over
any
place
where
treasure
has
been
concealed
that
treasure
has
been
hidden
he
went
on
in
the
region
through
which
you
came
last
night
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
for
it
was
the
ground
fought
over
for
centuries
by
the
wallachian
the
saxon
and
the
turk
why
there
is
hardly
a
foot
of
soil
in
all
this
region
that
has
not
been
enriched
by
the
blood
of
men
patriots
or
invaders
in
old
days
there
were
stirring
times
when
the
austrian
and
the
hungarian
came
up
in
hordes
and
the
patriots
went
out
to
meet
themmen
and
women
the
aged
and
the
children
tooand
waited
their
coming
on
the
rocks
above
the
passes
that
they
might
sweep
destruction
on
them
with
their
artificial
avalanches
when
the
invader
was
triumphant
he
found
but
little
for
whatever
there
was
had
been
sheltered
in
the
friendly
soil
but
how
said
i
can
it
have
remained
so
long
undiscovered
when
there
is
a
sure
index
to
it
if
men
will
but
take
the
trouble
to
look
the
count
smiled
and
as
his
lips
ran
back
over
his
gums
the
long
sharp
canine
teeth
showed
out
strangely
he
answered
because
your
peasant
is
at
heart
a
coward
and
a
fool
those
flames
only
appear
on
one
night
and
on
that
night
no
man
of
this
land
will
if
he
can
help
it
stir
without
his
doors
and
dear
sir
even
if
he
did
he
would
not
know
what
to
do
why
even
the
peasant
that
you
tell
me
of
who
marked
the
place
of
the
flame
would
not
know
where
to
look
in
daylight
even
for
his
own
work
even
you
would
not
i
dare
be
sworn
be
able
to
find
these
places
again
there
you
are
right
i
said
i
know
no
more
than
the
dead
where
even
to
look
for
them
then
we
drifted
into
other
matters
come
he
said
at
last
tell
me
of
london
and
of
the
house
which
you
have
procured
for
me
with
an
apology
for
my
remissness
i
went
into
my
own
room
to
get
the
papers
from
my
bag
whilst
i
was
placing
them
in
order
i
heard
a
rattling
of
china
and
silver
in
the
next
room
and
as
i
passed
through
noticed
that
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
the
lamp
lit
for
it
was
by
this
time
deep
into
the
dark
the
lamps
were
also
lit
in
the
study
or
library
and
i
found
the
count
lying
on
the
sofa
reading
of
all
things
in
the
world
an
english
bradshaws
guide
when
i
came
in
he
cleared
the
books
and
papers
from
the
table
and
with
him
i
went
into
plans
and
deeds
and
figures
of
all
sorts
he
was
interested
in
everything
and
asked
me
a
myriad
questions
about
the
place
and
its
surroundings
he
clearly
had
studied
beforehand
all
he
could
get
on
the
subject
of
the
neighbourhood
for
he
evidently
at
the
end
knew
very
much
more
than
i
did
when
i
remarked
this
he
answered
well
but
my
friend
is
it
not
needful
that
i
should
when
i
go
there
i
shall
be
all
alone
and
my
friend
harker
jonathannay
pardon
me
i
fall
into
my
countrys
habit
of
putting
your
patronymic
firstmy
friend
jonathan
harker
will
not
be
by
my
side
to
correct
and
aid
me
he
will
be
in
exeter
miles
away
probably
working
at
papers
of
the
law
with
my
other
friend
peter
hawkins
so
we
went
thoroughly
into
the
business
of
the
purchase
of
the
estate
at
purfleet
when
i
had
told
him
the
facts
and
got
his
signature
to
the
necessary
papers
and
had
written
a
letter
with
them
ready
to
post
to
mr
hawkins
he
began
to
ask
me
how
i
had
come
across
so
suitable
a
place
i
read
to
him
the
notes
which
i
had
made
at
the
time
and
which
i
inscribe
here
at
purfleet
on
a
byroad
i
came
across
just
such
a
place
as
seemed
to
be
required
and
where
was
displayed
a
dilapidated
notice
that
the
place
was
for
sale
it
is
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
of
ancient
structure
built
of
heavy
stones
and
has
not
been
repaired
for
a
large
number
of
years
the
closed
gates
are
of
heavy
old
oak
and
iron
all
eaten
with
rust
the
estate
is
called
carfax
no
doubt
a
corruption
of
the
old
quatre
face
as
the
house
is
foursided
agreeing
with
the
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
it
contains
in
all
some
twenty
acres
quite
surrounded
by
the
solid
stone
wall
above
mentioned
there
are
many
trees
on
it
which
make
it
in
places
gloomy
and
there
is
a
deep
darklooking
pond
or
small
lake
evidently
fed
by
some
springs
as
the
water
is
clear
and
flows
away
in
a
fairsized
stream
the
house
is
very
large
and
of
all
periods
back
i
should
say
to
medival
times
for
one
part
is
of
stone
immensely
thick
with
only
a
few
windows
high
up
and
heavily
barred
with
iron
it
looks
like
part
of
a
keep
and
is
close
to
an
old
chapel
or
church
i
could
not
enter
it
as
i
had
not
the
key
of
the
door
leading
to
it
from
the
house
but
i
have
taken
with
my
kodak
views
of
it
from
various
points
the
house
has
been
added
to
but
in
a
very
straggling
way
and
i
can
only
guess
at
the
amount
of
ground
it
covers
which
must
be
very
great
there
are
but
few
houses
close
at
hand
one
being
a
very
large
house
only
recently
added
to
and
formed
into
a
private
lunatic
asylum
it
is
not
however
visible
from
the
grounds
when
i
had
finished
he
said
i
am
glad
that
it
is
old
and
big
i
myself
am
of
an
old
family
and
to
live
in
a
new
house
would
kill
me
a
house
cannot
be
made
habitable
in
a
day
and
after
all
how
few
days
go
to
make
up
a
century
i
rejoice
also
that
there
is
a
chapel
of
old
times
we
transylvanian
nobles
love
not
to
think
that
our
bones
may
lie
amongst
the
common
dead
i
seek
not
gaiety
nor
mirth
not
the
bright
voluptuousness
of
much
sunshine
and
sparkling
waters
which
please
the
young
and
gay
i
am
no
longer
young
and
my
heart
through
weary
years
of
mourning
over
the
dead
is
not
attuned
to
mirth
moreover
the
walls
of
my
castle
are
broken
the
shadows
are
many
and
the
wind
breathes
cold
through
the
broken
battlements
and
casements
i
love
the
shade
and
the
shadow
and
would
be
alone
with
my
thoughts
when
i
may
somehow
his
words
and
his
look
did
not
seem
to
accord
or
else
it
was
that
his
cast
of
face
made
his
smile
look
malignant
and
saturnine
presently
with
an
excuse
he
left
me
asking
me
to
put
all
my
papers
together
he
was
some
little
time
away
and
i
began
to
look
at
some
of
the
books
around
me
one
was
an
atlas
which
i
found
opened
naturally
at
england
as
if
that
map
had
been
much
used
on
looking
at
it
i
found
in
certain
places
little
rings
marked
and
on
examining
these
i
noticed
that
one
was
near
london
on
the
east
side
manifestly
where
his
new
estate
was
situated
the
other
two
were
exeter
and
whitby
on
the
yorkshire
coast
it
was
the
better
part
of
an
hour
when
the
count
returned
aha
he
said
still
at
your
books
good
but
you
must
not
work
always
come
i
am
informed
that
your
supper
is
ready
he
took
my
arm
and
we
went
into
the
next
room
where
i
found
an
excellent
supper
ready
on
the
table
the
count
again
excused
himself
as
he
had
dined
out
on
his
being
away
from
home
but
he
sat
as
on
the
previous
night
and
chatted
whilst
i
ate
after
supper
i
smoked
as
on
the
last
evening
and
the
count
stayed
with
me
chatting
and
asking
questions
on
every
conceivable
subject
hour
after
hour
i
felt
that
it
was
getting
very
late
indeed
but
i
did
not
say
anything
for
i
felt
under
obligation
to
meet
my
hosts
wishes
in
every
way
i
was
not
sleepy
as
the
long
sleep
yesterday
had
fortified
me
but
i
could
not
help
experiencing
that
chill
which
comes
over
one
at
the
coming
of
the
dawn
which
is
like
in
its
way
the
turn
of
the
tide
they
say
that
people
who
are
near
death
die
generally
at
the
change
to
the
dawn
or
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
any
one
who
has
when
tired
and
tied
as
it
were
to
his
post
experienced
this
change
in
the
atmosphere
can
well
believe
it
all
at
once
we
heard
the
crow
of
a
cock
coming
up
with
preternatural
shrillness
through
the
clear
morning
air
count
dracula
jumping
to
his
feet
said
why
there
is
the
morning
again
how
remiss
i
am
to
let
you
stay
up
so
long
you
must
make
your
conversation
regarding
my
dear
new
country
of
england
less
interesting
so
that
i
may
not
forget
how
time
flies
by
us
and
with
a
courtly
bow
he
quickly
left
me
i
went
into
my
own
room
and
drew
the
curtains
but
there
was
little
to
notice
my
window
opened
into
the
courtyard
all
i
could
see
was
the
warm
grey
of
quickening
sky
so
i
pulled
the
curtains
again
and
have
written
of
this
day





8
mayi
began
to
fear
as
i
wrote
in
this
book
that
i
was
getting
too
diffuse
but
now
i
am
glad
that
i
went
into
detail
from
the
first
for
there
is
something
so
strange
about
this
place
and
all
in
it
that
i
cannot
but
feel
uneasy
i
wish
i
were
safe
out
of
it
or
that
i
had
never
come
it
may
be
that
this
strange
nightexistence
is
telling
on
me
but
would
that
that
were
all
if
there
were
any
one
to
talk
to
i
could
bear
it
but
there
is
no
one
i
have
only
the
count
to
speak
with
and
hei
fear
i
am
myself
the
only
living
soul
within
the
place
let
me
be
prosaic
so
far
as
facts
can
be
it
will
help
me
to
bear
up
and
imagination
must
not
run
riot
with
me
if
it
does
i
am
lost
let
me
say
at
once
how
i
standor
seem
to
i
only
slept
a
few
hours
when
i
went
to
bed
and
feeling
that
i
could
not
sleep
any
more
got
up
i
had
hung
my
shaving
glass
by
the
window
and
was
just
beginning
to
shave
suddenly
i
felt
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
heard
the
counts
voice
saying
to
me
goodmorning
i
started
for
it
amazed
me
that
i
had
not
seen
him
since
the
reflection
of
the
glass
covered
the
whole
room
behind
me
in
starting
i
had
cut
myself
slightly
but
did
not
notice
it
at
the
moment
having
answered
the
counts
salutation
i
turned
to
the
glass
again
to
see
how
i
had
been
mistaken
this
time
there
could
be
no
error
for
the
man
was
close
to
me
and
i
could
see
him
over
my
shoulder
but
there
was
no
reflection
of
him
in
the
mirror
the
whole
room
behind
me
was
displayed
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
man
in
it
except
myself
this
was
startling
and
coming
on
the
top
of
so
many
strange
things
was
beginning
to
increase
that
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
which
i
always
have
when
the
count
is
near
but
at
the
instant
i
saw
that
the
cut
had
bled
a
little
and
the
blood
was
trickling
over
my
chin
i
laid
down
the
razor
turning
as
i
did
so
half
round
to
look
for
some
sticking
plaster
when
the
count
saw
my
face
his
eyes
blazed
with
a
sort
of
demoniac
fury
and
he
suddenly
made
a
grab
at
my
throat
i
drew
away
and
his
hand
touched
the
string
of
beads
which
held
the
crucifix
it
made
an
instant
change
in
him
for
the
fury
passed
so
quickly
that
i
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
ever
there
take
care
he
said
take
care
how
you
cut
yourself
it
is
more
dangerous
than
you
think
in
this
country
then
seizing
the
shaving
glass
he
went
on
and
this
is
the
wretched
thing
that
has
done
the
mischief
it
is
a
foul
bauble
of
mans
vanity
away
with
it
and
opening
the
heavy
window
with
one
wrench
of
his
terrible
hand
he
flung
out
the
glass
which
was
shattered
into
a
thousand
pieces
on
the
stones
of
the
courtyard
far
below
then
he
withdrew
without
a
word
it
is
very
annoying
for
i
do
not
see
how
i
am
to
shave
unless
in
my
watchcase
or
the
bottom
of
the
shavingpot
which
is
fortunately
of
metal
when
i
went
into
the
diningroom
breakfast
was
prepared
but
i
could
not
find
the
count
anywhere
so
i
breakfasted
alone
it
is
strange
that
as
yet
i
have
not
seen
the
count
eat
or
drink
he
must
be
a
very
peculiar
man
after
breakfast
i
did
a
little
exploring
in
the
castle
i
went
out
on
the
stairs
and
found
a
room
looking
towards
the
south
the
view
was
magnificent
and
from
where
i
stood
there
was
every
opportunity
of
seeing
it
the
castle
is
on
the
very
edge
of
a
terrible
precipice
a
stone
falling
from
the
window
would
fall
a
thousand
feet
without
touching
anything
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
a
sea
of
green
tree
tops
with
occasionally
a
deep
rift
where
there
is
a
chasm
here
and
there
are
silver
threads
where
the
rivers
wind
in
deep
gorges
through
the
forests
but
i
am
not
in
heart
to
describe
beauty
for
when
i
had
seen
the
view
i
explored
further
doors
doors
doors
everywhere
and
all
locked
and
bolted
in
no
place
save
from
the
windows
in
the
castle
walls
is
there
an
available
exit
the
castle
is
a
veritable
prison
and
i
am
a
prisoner

iii
jonathan
harkers
journalcontinued
when
i
found
that
i
was
a
prisoner
a
sort
of
wild
feeling
came
over
me
i
rushed
up
and
down
the
stairs
trying
every
door
and
peering
out
of
every
window
i
could
find
but
after
a
little
the
conviction
of
my
helplessness
overpowered
all
other
feelings
when
i
look
back
after
a
few
hours
i
think
i
must
have
been
mad
for
the
time
for
i
behaved
much
as
a
rat
does
in
a
trap
when
however
the
conviction
had
come
to
me
that
i
was
helpless
i
sat
down
quietlyas
quietly
as
i
have
ever
done
anything
in
my
lifeand
began
to
think
over
what
was
best
to
be
done
i
am
thinking
still
and
as
yet
have
come
to
no
definite
conclusion
of
one
thing
only
am
i
certain
that
it
is
no
use
making
my
ideas
known
to
the
count
he
knows
well
that
i
am
imprisoned
and
as
he
has
done
it
himself
and
has
doubtless
his
own
motives
for
it
he
would
only
deceive
me
if
i
trusted
him
fully
with
the
facts
so
far
as
i
can
see
my
only
plan
will
be
to
keep
my
knowledge
and
my
fears
to
myself
and
my
eyes
open
i
am
i
know
either
being
deceived
like
a
baby
by
my
own
fears
or
else
i
am
in
desperate
straits
and
if
the
latter
be
so
i
need
and
shall
need
all
my
brains
to
get
through
i
had
hardly
come
to
this
conclusion
when
i
heard
the
great
door
below
shut
and
knew
that
the
count
had
returned
he
did
not
come
at
once
into
the
library
so
i
went
cautiously
to
my
own
room
and
found
him
making
the
bed
this
was
odd
but
only
confirmed
what
i
had
all
along
thoughtthat
there
were
no
servants
in
the
house
when
later
i
saw
him
through
the
chink
of
the
hinges
of
the
door
laying
the
table
in
the
diningroom
i
was
assured
of
it
for
if
he
does
himself
all
these
menial
offices
surely
it
is
proof
that
there
is
no
one
else
to
do
them
this
gave
me
a
fright
for
if
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
castle
it
must
have
been
the
count
himself
who
was
the
driver
of
the
coach
that
brought
me
here
this
is
a
terrible
thought
for
if
so
what
does
it
mean
that
he
could
control
the
wolves
as
he
did
by
only
holding
up
his
hand
in
silence
how
was
it
that
all
the
people
at
bistritz
and
on
the
coach
had
some
terrible
fear
for
me
what
meant
the
giving
of
the
crucifix
of
the
garlic
of
the
wild
rose
of
the
mountain
ash
bless
that
good
good
woman
who
hung
the
crucifix
round
my
neck
for
it
is
a
comfort
and
a
strength
to
me
whenever
i
touch
it
it
is
odd
that
a
thing
which
i
have
been
taught
to
regard
with
disfavour
and
as
idolatrous
should
in
a
time
of
loneliness
and
trouble
be
of
help
is
it
that
there
is
something
in
the
essence
of
the
thing
itself
or
that
it
is
a
medium
a
tangible
help
in
conveying
memories
of
sympathy
and
comfort
some
time
if
it
may
be
i
must
examine
this
matter
and
try
to
make
up
my
mind
about
it
in
the
meantime
i
must
find
out
all
i
can
about
count
dracula
as
it
may
help
me
to
understand
tonight
he
may
talk
of
himself
if
i
turn
the
conversation
that
way
i
must
be
very
careful
however
not
to
awake
his
suspicion





midnighti
have
had
a
long
talk
with
the
count
i
asked
him
a
few
questions
on
transylvania
history
and
he
warmed
up
to
the
subject
wonderfully
in
his
speaking
of
things
and
people
and
especially
of
battles
he
spoke
as
if
he
had
been
present
at
them
all
this
he
afterwards
explained
by
saying
that
to
a
boyar
the
pride
of
his
house
and
name
is
his
own
pride
that
their
glory
is
his
glory
that
their
fate
is
his
fate
whenever
he
spoke
of
his
house
he
always
said
we
and
spoke
almost
in
the
plural
like
a
king
speaking
i
wish
i
could
put
down
all
he
said
exactly
as
he
said
it
for
to
me
it
was
most
fascinating
it
seemed
to
have
in
it
a
whole
history
of
the
country
he
grew
excited
as
he
spoke
and
walked
about
the
room
pulling
his
great
white
moustache
and
grasping
anything
on
which
he
laid
his
hands
as
though
he
would
crush
it
by
main
strength
one
thing
he
said
which
i
shall
put
down
as
nearly
as
i
can
for
it
tells
in
its
way
the
story
of
his
race
we
szekelys
have
a
right
to
be
proud
for
in
our
veins
flows
the
blood
of
many
brave
races
who
fought
as
the
lion
fights
for
lordship
here
in
the
whirlpool
of
european
races
the
ugric
tribe
bore
down
from
iceland
the
fighting
spirit
which
thor
and
wodin
gave
them
which
their
berserkers
displayed
to
such
fell
intent
on
the
seaboards
of
europe
ay
and
of
asia
and
africa
too
till
the
peoples
thought
that
the
werewolves
themselves
had
come
here
too
when
they
came
they
found
the
huns
whose
warlike
fury
had
swept
the
earth
like
a
living
flame
till
the
dying
peoples
held
that
in
their
veins
ran
the
blood
of
those
old
witches
who
expelled
from
scythia
had
mated
with
the
devils
in
the
desert
fools
fools
what
devil
or
what
witch
was
ever
so
great
as
attila
whose
blood
is
in
these
veins
he
held
up
his
arms
is
it
a
wonder
that
we
were
a
conquering
race
that
we
were
proud
that
when
the
magyar
the
lombard
the
avar
the
bulgar
or
the
turk
poured
his
thousands
on
our
frontiers
we
drove
them
back
is
it
strange
that
when
arpad
and
his
legions
swept
through
the
hungarian
fatherland
he
found
us
here
when
he
reached
the
frontier
that
the
honfoglalas
was
completed
there
and
when
the
hungarian
flood
swept
eastward
the
szekelys
were
claimed
as
kindred
by
the
victorious
magyars
and
to
us
for
centuries
was
trusted
the
guarding
of
the
frontier
of
turkeyland
ay
and
more
than
that
endless
duty
of
the
frontier
guard
for
as
the
turks
say
water
sleeps
and
enemy
is
sleepless
who
more
gladly
than
we
throughout
the
four
nations
received
the
bloody
sword
or
at
its
warlike
call
flocked
quicker
to
the
standard
of
the
king
when
was
redeemed
that
great
shame
of
my
nation
the
shame
of
cassova
when
the
flags
of
the
wallach
and
the
magyar
went
down
beneath
the
crescent
who
was
it
but
one
of
my
own
race
who
as
voivode
crossed
the
danube
and
beat
the
turk
on
his
own
ground
this
was
a
dracula
indeed
woe
was
it
that
his
own
unworthy
brother
when
he
had
fallen
sold
his
people
to
the
turk
and
brought
the
shame
of
slavery
on
them
was
it
not
this
dracula
indeed
who
inspired
that
other
of
his
race
who
in
a
later
age
again
and
again
brought
his
forces
over
the
great
river
into
turkeyland
who
when
he
was
beaten
back
came
again
and
again
and
again
though
he
had
to
come
alone
from
the
bloody
field
where
his
troops
were
being
slaughtered
since
he
knew
that
he
alone
could
ultimately
triumph
they
said
that
he
thought
only
of
himself
bah
what
good
are
peasants
without
a
leader
where
ends
the
war
without
a
brain
and
heart
to
conduct
it
again
when
after
the
battle
of
mohcs
we
threw
off
the
hungarian
yoke
we
of
the
dracula
blood
were
amongst
their
leaders
for
our
spirit
would
not
brook
that
we
were
not
free
ah
young
sir
the
szekelysand
the
dracula
as
their
hearts
blood
their
brains
and
their
swordscan
boast
a
record
that
mushroom
growths
like
the
hapsburgs
and
the
romanoffs
can
never
reach
the
warlike
days
are
over
blood
is
too
precious
a
thing
in
these
days
of
dishonourable
peace
and
the
glories
of
the
great
races
are
as
a
tale
that
is
told
it
was
by
this
time
close
on
morning
and
we
went
to
bed
mem
this
diary
seems
horribly
like
the
beginning
of
the
arabian
nights

maylet
me
begin
with
factsbare
meagre
facts
verified
by
books
and
figures
and
of
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
must
not
confuse
them
with
experiences
which
will
have
to
rest
on
my
own
observation
or
my
memory
of
them
last
evening
when
the
count
came
from
his
room
he
began
by
asking
me
questions
on
legal
matters
and
on
the
doing
of
certain
kinds
of
business
i
had
spent
the
day
wearily
over
books
and
simply
to
keep
my
mind
occupied
went
over
some
of
the
matters
i
had
been
examining
at
lincolns
inn
there
was
a
certain
method
in
the
counts
inquiries
so
i
shall
try
to
put
them
down
in
sequence
the
knowledge
may
somehow
or
some
time
be
useful
to
me
first
he
asked
if
a
man
in
england
might
have
two
solicitors
or
more
i
told
him
he
might
have
a
dozen
if
he
wished
but
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
have
more
than
one
solicitor
engaged
in
one
transaction
as
only
one
could
act
at
a
time
and
that
to
change
would
be
certain
to
militate
against
his
interest
he
seemed
thoroughly
to
understand
and
went
on
to
ask
if
there
would
be
any
practical
difficulty
in
having
one
man
to
attend
say
to
banking
and
another
to
look
after
shipping
in
case
local
help
were
needed
in
a
place
far
from
the
home
of
the
banking
solicitor
i
asked
him
to
explain
more
fully
so
that
i
might
not
by
any
chance
mislead
him
so
he
said
i
shall
illustrate
your
friend
and
mine
mr
peter
hawkins
from
under
the
shadow
of
your
beautiful
cathedral
at
exeter
which
is
far
from
london
buys
for
me
through
your
good
self
my
place
at
london
good
now
here
let
me
say
frankly
lest
you
should
think
it
strange
that
i
have
sought
the
services
of
one
so
far
off
from
london
instead
of
some
one
resident
there
that
my
motive
was
that
no
local
interest
might
be
served
save
my
wish
only
and
as
one
of
london
residence
might
perhaps
have
some
purpose
of
himself
or
friend
to
serve
i
went
thus
afield
to
seek
my
agent
whose
labours
should
be
only
to
my
interest
now
suppose
i
who
have
much
of
affairs
wish
to
ship
goods
say
to
newcastle
or
durham
or
harwich
or
dover
might
it
not
be
that
it
could
with
more
ease
be
done
by
consigning
to
one
in
these
ports
i
answered
that
certainly
it
would
be
most
easy
but
that
we
solicitors
had
a
system
of
agency
one
for
the
other
so
that
local
work
could
be
done
locally
on
instruction
from
any
solicitor
so
that
the
client
simply
placing
himself
in
the
hands
of
one
man
could
have
his
wishes
carried
out
by
him
without
further
trouble
but
said
he
i
could
be
at
liberty
to
direct
myself
is
it
not
so
of
course
i
replied
and
such
is
often
done
by
men
of
business
who
do
not
like
the
whole
of
their
affairs
to
be
known
by
any
one
person
good
he
said
and
then
went
on
to
ask
about
the
means
of
making
consignments
and
the
forms
to
be
gone
through
and
of
all
sorts
of
difficulties
which
might
arise
but
by
forethought
could
be
guarded
against
i
explained
all
these
things
to
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
he
certainly
left
me
under
the
impression
that
he
would
have
made
a
wonderful
solicitor
for
there
was
nothing
that
he
did
not
think
of
or
foresee
for
a
man
who
was
never
in
the
country
and
who
did
not
evidently
do
much
in
the
way
of
business
his
knowledge
and
acumen
were
wonderful
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
on
these
points
of
which
he
had
spoken
and
i
had
verified
all
as
well
as
i
could
by
the
books
available
he
suddenly
stood
up
and
said
have
you
written
since
your
first
letter
to
our
friend
mr
peter
hawkins
or
to
any
other
it
was
with
some
bitterness
in
my
heart
that
i
answered
that
i
had
not
that
as
yet
i
had
not
seen
any
opportunity
of
sending
letters
to
anybody
then
write
now
my
young
friend
he
said
laying
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
write
to
our
friend
and
to
any
other
and
say
if
it
will
please
you
that
you
shall
stay
with
me
until
a
month
from
now
do
you
wish
me
to
stay
so
long
i
asked
for
my
heart
grew
cold
at
the
thought
i
desire
it
much
nay
i
will
take
no
refusal
when
your
master
employer
what
you
will
engaged
that
someone
should
come
on
his
behalf
it
was
understood
that
my
needs
only
were
to
be
consulted
i
have
not
stinted
is
it
not
so
what
could
i
do
but
bow
acceptance
it
was
mr
hawkinss
interest
not
mine
and
i
had
to
think
of
him
not
myself
and
besides
while
count
dracula
was
speaking
there
was
that
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
bearing
which
made
me
remember
that
i
was
a
prisoner
and
that
if
i
wished
it
i
could
have
no
choice
the
count
saw
his
victory
in
my
bow
and
his
mastery
in
the
trouble
of
my
face
for
he
began
at
once
to
use
them
but
in
his
own
smooth
resistless
way
i
pray
you
my
good
young
friend
that
you
will
not
discourse
of
things
other
than
business
in
your
letters
it
will
doubtless
please
your
friends
to
know
that
you
are
well
and
that
you
look
forward
to
getting
home
to
them
is
it
not
so
as
he
spoke
he
handed
me
three
sheets
of
notepaper
and
three
envelopes
they
were
all
of
the
thinnest
foreign
post
and
looking
at
them
then
at
him
and
noticing
his
quiet
smile
with
the
sharp
canine
teeth
lying
over
the
red
underlip
i
understood
as
well
as
if
he
had
spoken
that
i
should
be
careful
what
i
wrote
for
he
would
be
able
to
read
it
so
i
determined
to
write
only
formal
notes
now
but
to
write
fully
to
mr
hawkins
in
secret
and
also
to
mina
for
to
her
i
could
write
in
shorthand
which
would
puzzle
the
count
if
he
did
see
it
when
i
had
written
my
two
letters
i
sat
quiet
reading
a
book
whilst
the
count
wrote
several
notes
referring
as
he
wrote
them
to
some
books
on
his
table
then
he
took
up
my
two
and
placed
them
with
his
own
and
put
by
his
writing
materials
after
which
the
instant
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
i
leaned
over
and
looked
at
the
letters
which
were
face
down
on
the
table
i
felt
no
compunction
in
doing
so
for
under
the
circumstances
i
felt
that
i
should
protect
myself
in
every
way
i
could
one
of
the
letters
was
directed
to
samuel
f
billington
no

the

to

london
and
the
fourth
to
herren
klopstock

billreuth
bankers
budapesth
the
second
and
fourth
were
unsealed
i
was
just
about
to
look
at
them
when
i
saw
the
doorhandle
move
i
sank
back
in
my
seat
having
just
had
time
to
replace
the
letters
as
they
had
been
and
to
resume
my
book
before
the
count
holding
still
another
letter
in
his
hand
entered
the
room
he
took
up
the
letters
on
the
table
and
stamped
them
carefully
and
then
turning
to
me
said
i
trust
you
will
forgive
me
but
i
have
much
work
to
do
in
private
this
evening
you
will
i
hope
find
all
things
as
you
wish
at
the
door
he
turned
and
after
a
moments
pause
said
let
me
advise
you
my
dear
young
friendnay
let
me
warn
you
with
all
seriousness
that
should
you
leave
these
rooms
you
will
not
by
any
chance
go
to
sleep
in
any
other
part
of
the
castle
it
is
old
and
has
many
memories
and
there
are
bad
dreams
for
those
who
sleep
unwisely
be
warned
should
sleep
now
or
ever
overcome
you
or
be
like
to
do
then
haste
to
your
own
chamber
or
to
these
rooms
for
your
rest
will
then
be
safe
but
if
you
be
not
careful
in
this
respect
thenhe
finished
his
speech
in
a
gruesome
way
for
he
motioned
with
his
hands
as
if
he
were
washing
them
i
quite
understood
my
only
doubt
was
as
to
whether
any
dream
could
be
more
terrible
than
the
unnatural
horrible
net
of
gloom
and
mystery
which
seemed
closing
around
me





lateri
endorse
the
last
words
written
but
this
time
there
is
no
doubt
in
question
i
shall
not
fear
to
sleep
in
any
place
where
he
is
not
i
have
placed
the
crucifix
over
the
head
of
my
bedi
imagine
that
my
rest
is
thus
freer
from
dreams
and
there
it
shall
remain
when
he
left
me
i
went
to
my
room
after
a
little
while
not
hearing
any
sound
i
came
out
and
went
up
the
stone
stair
to
where
i
could
look
out
towards
the
south
there
was
some
sense
of
freedom
in
the
vast
expanse
inaccessible
though
it
was
to
me
as
compared
with
the
narrow
darkness
of
the
courtyard
looking
out
on
this
i
felt
that
i
was
indeed
in
prison
and
i
seemed
to
want
a
breath
of
fresh
air
though
it
were
of
the
night
i
am
beginning
to
feel
this
nocturnal
existence
tell
on
me
it
is
destroying
my
nerve
i
start
at
my
own
shadow
and
am
full
of
all
sorts
of
horrible
imaginings
god
knows
that
there
is
ground
for
my
terrible
fear
in
this
accursed
place
i
looked
out
over
the
beautiful
expanse
bathed
in
soft
yellow
moonlight
till
it
was
almost
as
light
as
day
in
the
soft
light
the
distant
hills
became
melted
and
the
shadows
in
the
valleys
and
gorges
of
velvety
blackness
the
mere
beauty
seemed
to
cheer
me
there
was
peace
and
comfort
in
every
breath
i
drew
as
i
leaned
from
the
window
my
eye
was
caught
by
something
moving
a
storey
below
me
and
somewhat
to
my
left
where
i
imagined
from
the
order
of
the
rooms
that
the
windows
of
the
counts
own
room
would
look
out
the
window
at
which
i
stood
was
tall
and
deep
stonemullioned
and
though
weatherworn
was
still
complete
but
it
was
evidently
many
a
day
since
the
case
had
been
there
i
drew
back
behind
the
stonework
and
looked
carefully
out
what
i
saw
was
the
counts
head
coming
out
from
the
window
i
did
not
see
the
face
but
i
knew
the
man
by
the
neck
and
the
movement
of
his
back
and
arms
in
any
case
i
could
not
mistake
the
hands
which
i
had
had
so
many
opportunities
of
studying
i
was
at
first
interested
and
somewhat
amused
for
it
is
wonderful
how
small
a
matter
will
interest
and
amuse
a
man
when
he
is
a
prisoner
but
my
very
feelings
changed
to
repulsion
and
terror
when
i
saw
the
whole
man
slowly
emerge
from
the
window
and
begin
to
crawl
down
the
castle
wall
over
that
dreadful
abyss
face
down
with
his
cloak
spreading
out
around
him
like
great
wings
at
first
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
i
thought
it
was
some
trick
of
the
moonlight
some
weird
effect
of
shadow
but
i
kept
looking
and
it
could
be
no
delusion
i
saw
the
fingers
and
toes
grasp
the
corners
of
the
stones
worn
clear
of
the
mortar
by
the
stress
of
years
and
by
thus
using
every
projection
and
inequality
move
downwards
with
considerable
speed
just
as
a
lizard
moves
along
a
wall
what
manner
of
man
is
this
or
what
manner
of
creature
is
it
in
the
semblance
of
man
i
feel
the
dread
of
this
horrible
place
overpowering
me
i
am
in
fearin
awful
fearand
there
is
no
escape
for
me
i
am
encompassed
about
with
terrors
that
i
dare
not
think
of





15
mayonce
more
have
i
seen
the
count
go
out
in
his
lizard
fashion
he
moved
downwards
in
a
sidelong
way
some
hundred
feet
down
and
a
good
deal
to
the
left
he
vanished
into
some
hole
or
window
when
his
head
had
disappeared
i
leaned
out
to
try
and
see
more
but
without
availthe
distance
was
too
great
to
allow
a
proper
angle
of
sight
i
knew
he
had
left
the
castle
now
and
thought
to
use
the
opportunity
to
explore
more
than
i
had
dared
to
do
as
yet
i
went
back
to
the
room
and
taking
a
lamp
tried
all
the
doors
they
were
all
locked
as
i
had
expected
and
the
locks
were
comparatively
new
but
i
went
down
the
stone
stairs
to
the
hall
where
i
had
entered
originally
i
found
i
could
pull
back
the
bolts
easily
enough
and
unhook
the
great
chains
but
the
door
was
locked
and
the
key
was
gone
that
key
must
be
in
the
counts
room
i
must
watch
should
his
door
be
unlocked
so
that
i
may
get
it
and
escape
i
went
on
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
various
stairs
and
passages
and
to
try
the
doors
that
opened
from
them
one
or
two
small
rooms
near
the
hall
were
open
but
there
was
nothing
to
see
in
them
except
old
furniture
dusty
with
age
and
motheaten
at
last
however
i
found
one
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
which
though
it
seemed
to
be
locked
gave
a
little
under
pressure
i
tried
it
harder
and
found
that
it
was
not
really
locked
but
that
the
resistance
came
from
the
fact
that
the
hinges
had
fallen
somewhat
and
the
heavy
door
rested
on
the
floor
here
was
an
opportunity
which
i
might
not
have
again
so
i
exerted
myself
and
with
many
efforts
forced
it
back
so
that
i
could
enter
i
was
now
in
a
wing
of
the
castle
further
to
the
right
than
the
rooms
i
knew
and
a
storey
lower
down
from
the
windows
i
could
see
that
the
suite
of
rooms
lay
along
to
the
south
of
the
castle
the
windows
of
the
end
room
looking
out
both
west
and
south
on
the
latter
side
as
well
as
to
the
former
there
was
a
great
precipice
the
castle
was
built
on
the
corner
of
a
great
rock
so
that
on
three
sides
it
was
quite
impregnable
and
great
windows
were
placed
here
where
sling
or
bow
or
culverin
could
not
reach
and
consequently
light
and
comfort
impossible
to
a
position
which
had
to
be
guarded
were
secured
to
the
west
was
a
great
valley
and
then
rising
far
away
great
jagged
mountain
fastnesses
rising
peak
on
peak
the
sheer
rock
studded
with
mountain
ash
and
thorn
whose
roots
clung
in
cracks
and
crevices
and
crannies
of
the
stone
this
was
evidently
the
portion
of
the
castle
occupied
by
the
ladies
in
bygone
days
for
the
furniture
had
more
air
of
comfort
than
any
i
had
seen
the
windows
were
curtainless
and
the
yellow
moonlight
flooding
in
through
the
diamond
panes
enabled
one
to
see
even
colours
whilst
it
softened
the
wealth
of
dust
which
lay
over
all
and
disguised
in
some
measure
the
ravages
of
time
and
the
moth
my
lamp
seemed
to
be
of
little
effect
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
but
i
was
glad
to
have
it
with
me
for
there
was
a
dread
loneliness
in
the
place
which
chilled
my
heart
and
made
my
nerves
tremble
still
it
was
better
than
living
alone
in
the
rooms
which
i
had
come
to
hate
from
the
presence
of
the
count
and
after
trying
a
little
to
school
my
nerves
i
found
a
soft
quietude
come
over
me
here
i
am
sitting
at
a
little
oak
table
where
in
old
times
possibly
some
fair
lady
sat
to
pen
with
much
thought
and
many
blushes
her
illspelt
loveletter
and
writing
in
my
diary
in
shorthand
all
that
has
happened
since
i
closed
it
last
it
is
nineteenth
century
uptodate
with
a
vengeance
and
yet
unless
my
senses
deceive
me
the
old
centuries
had
and
have
powers
of
their
own
which
mere
modernity
cannot
kill





later
the
morning
of
16
maygod
preserve
my
sanity
for
to
this
i
am
reduced
safety
and
the
assurance
of
safety
are
things
of
the
past
whilst
i
live
on
here
there
is
but
one
thing
to
hope
for
that
i
may
not
go
mad
if
indeed
i
be
not
mad
already
if
i
be
sane
then
surely
it
is
maddening
to
think
that
of
all
the
foul
things
that
lurk
in
this
hateful
place
the
count
is
the
least
dreadful
to
me
that
to
him
alone
i
can
look
for
safety
even
though
this
be
only
whilst
i
can
serve
his
purpose
great
god
merciful
god
let
me
be
calm
for
out
of
that
way
lies
madness
indeed
i
begin
to
get
new
lights
on
certain
things
which
have
puzzled
me
up
to
now
i
never
quite
knew
what
shakespeare
meant
when
he
made
hamlet
say
my
tablets
quick
my
tablets
tis
meet
that
i
put
it
down
etc
for
now
feeling
as
though
my
own
brain
were
unhinged
or
as
if
the
shock
had
come
which
must
end
in
its
undoing
i
turn
to
my
diary
for
repose
the
habit
of
entering
accurately
must
help
to
soothe
me
the
counts
mysterious
warning
frightened
me
at
the
time
it
frightens
me
more
now
when
i
think
of
it
for
in
future
he
has
a
fearful
hold
upon
me
i
shall
fear
to
doubt
what
he
may
say
when
i
had
written
in
my
diary
and
had
fortunately
replaced
the
book
and
pen
in
my
pocket
i
felt
sleepy
the
counts
warning
came
into
my
mind
but
i
took
a
pleasure
in
disobeying
it
the
sense
of
sleep
was
upon
me
and
with
it
the
obstinacy
which
sleep
brings
as
outrider
the
soft
moonlight
soothed
and
the
wide
expanse
without
gave
a
sense
of
freedom
which
refreshed
me
i
determined
not
to
return
tonight
to
the
gloomhaunted
rooms
but
to
sleep
here
where
of
old
ladies
had
sat
and
sung
and
lived
sweet
lives
whilst
their
gentle
breasts
were
sad
for
their
menfolk
away
in
the
midst
of
remorseless
wars
i
drew
a
great
couch
out
of
its
place
near
the
corner
so
that
as
i
lay
i
could
look
at
the
lovely
view
to
east
and
south
and
unthinking
of
and
uncaring
for
the
dust
composed
myself
for
sleep
i
suppose
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
i
hope
so
but
i
fear
for
all
that
followed
was
startlingly
realso
real
that
now
sitting
here
in
the
broad
full
sunlight
of
the
morning
i
cannot
in
the
least
believe
that
it
was
all
sleep
i
was
not
alone
the
room
was
the
same
unchanged
in
any
way
since
i
came
into
it
i
could
see
along
the
floor
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
my
own
footsteps
marked
where
i
had
disturbed
the
long
accumulation
of
dust
in
the
moonlight
opposite
me
were
three
young
women
ladies
by
their
dress
and
manner
i
thought
at
the
time
that
i
must
be
dreaming
when
i
saw
them
for
though
the
moonlight
was
behind
them
they
threw
no
shadow
on
the
floor
they
came
close
to
me
and
looked
at
me
for
some
time
and
then
whispered
together
two
were
dark
and
had
high
aquiline
noses
like
the
count
and
great
dark
piercing
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
almost
red
when
contrasted
with
the
pale
yellow
moon
the
other
was
fair
as
fair
as
can
be
with
great
wavy
masses
of
golden
hair
and
eyes
like
pale
sapphires
i
seemed
somehow
to
know
her
face
and
to
know
it
in
connection
with
some
dreamy
fear
but
i
could
not
recollect
at
the
moment
how
or
where
all
three
had
brilliant
white
teeth
that
shone
like
pearls
against
the
ruby
of
their
voluptuous
lips
there
was
something
about
them
that
made
me
uneasy
some
longing
and
at
the
same
time
some
deadly
fear
i
felt
in
my
heart
a
wicked
burning
desire
that
they
would
kiss
me
with
those
red
lips
it
is
not
good
to
note
this
down
lest
some
day
it
should
meet
minas
eyes
and
cause
her
pain
but
it
is
the
truth
they
whispered
together
and
then
they
all
three
laughedsuch
a
silvery
musical
laugh
but
as
hard
as
though
the
sound
never
could
have
come
through
the
softness
of
human
lips
it
was
like
the
intolerable
tingling
sweetness
of
waterglasses
when
played
on
by
a
cunning
hand
the
fair
girl
shook
her
head
coquettishly
and
the
other
two
urged
her
on
one
said
go
on
you
are
first
and
we
shall
follow
yours
is
the
right
to
begin
the
other
added
he
is
young
and
strong
there
are
kisses
for
us
all
i
lay
quiet
looking
out
under
my
eyelashes
in
an
agony
of
delightful
anticipation
the
fair
girl
advanced
and
bent
over
me
till
i
could
feel
the
movement
of
her
breath
upon
me
sweet
it
was
in
one
sense
honeysweet
and
sent
the
same
tingling
through
the
nerves
as
her
voice
but
with
a
bitter
underlying
the
sweet
a
bitter
offensiveness
as
one
smells
in
blood
i
was
afraid
to
raise
my
eyelids
but
looked
out
and
saw
perfectly
under
the
lashes
the
girl
went
on
her
knees
and
bent
over
me
simply
gloating
there
was
a
deliberate
voluptuousness
which
was
both
thrilling
and
repulsive
and
as
she
arched
her
neck
she
actually
licked
her
lips
like
an
animal
till
i
could
see
in
the
moonlight
the
moisture
shining
on
the
scarlet
lips
and
on
the
red
tongue
as
it
lapped
the
white
sharp
teeth
lower
and
lower
went
her
head
as
the
lips
went
below
the
range
of
my
mouth
and
chin
and
seemed
about
to
fasten
on
my
throat
then
she
paused
and
i
could
hear
the
churning
sound
of
her
tongue
as
it
licked
her
teeth
and
lips
and
could
feel
the
hot
breath
on
my
neck
then
the
skin
of
my
throat
began
to
tingle
as
ones
flesh
does
when
the
hand
that
is
to
tickle
it
approaches
nearernearer
i
could
feel
the
soft
shivering
touch
of
the
lips
on
the
supersensitive
skin
of
my
throat
and
the
hard
dents
of
two
sharp
teeth
just
touching
and
pausing
there
i
closed
my
eyes
in
a
languorous
ecstasy
and
waitedwaited
with
beating
heart
but
at
that
instant
another
sensation
swept
through
me
as
quick
as
lightning
i
was
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
count
and
of
his
being
as
if
lapped
in
a
storm
of
fury
as
my
eyes
opened
involuntarily
i
saw
his
strong
hand
grasp
the
slender
neck
of
the
fair
woman
and
with
giants
power
draw
it
back
the
blue
eyes
transformed
with
fury
the
white
teeth
champing
with
rage
and
the
fair
cheeks
blazing
red
with
passion
but
the
count
never
did
i
imagine
such
wrath
and
fury
even
to
the
demons
of
the
pit
his
eyes
were
positively
blazing
the
red
light
in
them
was
lurid
as
if
the
flames
of
hellfire
blazed
behind
them
his
face
was
deathly
pale
and
the
lines
of
it
were
hard
like
drawn
wires
the
thick
eyebrows
that
met
over
the
nose
now
seemed
like
a
heaving
bar
of
whitehot
metal
with
a
fierce
sweep
of
his
arm
he
hurled
the
woman
from
him
and
then
motioned
to
the
others
as
though
he
were
beating
them
back
it
was
the
same
imperious
gesture
that
i
had
seen
used
to
the
wolves
in
a
voice
which
though
low
and
almost
in
a
whisper
seemed
to
cut
through
the
air
and
then
ring
round
the
room
he
said
how
dare
you
touch
him
any
of
you
how
dare
you
cast
eyes
on
him
when
i
had
forbidden
it
back
i
tell
you
all
this
man
belongs
to
me
beware
how
you
meddle
with
him
or
youll
have
to
deal
with
me
the
fair
girl
with
a
laugh
of
ribald
coquetry
turned
to
answer
him
you
yourself
never
loved
you
never
love
on
this
the
other
women
joined
and
such
a
mirthless
hard
soulless
laughter
rang
through
the
room
that
it
almost
made
me
faint
to
hear
it
seemed
like
the
pleasure
of
fiends
then
the
count
turned
after
looking
at
my
face
attentively
and
said
in
a
soft
whisper
yes
i
too
can
love
you
yourselves
can
tell
it
from
the
past
is
it
not
so
well
now
i
promise
you
that
when
i
am
done
with
him
you
shall
kiss
him
at
your
will
now
go
go
i
must
awaken
him
for
there
is
work
to
be
done
are
we
to
have
nothing
tonight
said
one
of
them
with
a
low
laugh
as
she
pointed
to
the
bag
which
he
had
thrown
upon
the
floor
and
which
moved
as
though
there
were
some
living
thing
within
it
for
answer
he
nodded
his
head
one
of
the
women
jumped
forward
and
opened
it
if
my
ears
did
not
deceive
me
there
was
a
gasp
and
a
low
wail
as
of
a
halfsmothered
child
the
women
closed
round
whilst
i
was
aghast
with
horror
but
as
i
looked
they
disappeared
and
with
them
the
dreadful
bag
there
was
no
door
near
them
and
they
could
not
have
passed
me
without
my
noticing
they
simply
seemed
to
fade
into
the
rays
of
the
moonlight
and
pass
out
through
the
window
for
i
could
see
outside
the
dim
shadowy
forms
for
a
moment
before
they
entirely
faded
away
then
the
horror
overcame
me
and
i
sank
down
unconscious
chapter

journalcontinued
i
awoke
in
my
own
bed
if
it
be
that
i
had
not
dreamt
the
count
must
have
carried
me
here
i
tried
to
satisfy
myself
on
the
subject
but
could
not
arrive
at
any
unquestionable
result
to
be
sure
there
were
certain
small
evidences
such
as
that
my
clothes
were
folded
and
laid
by
in
a
manner
which
was
not
my
habit
my
watch
was
still
unwound
and
i
am
rigorously
accustomed
to
wind
it
the
last
thing
before
going
to
bed
and
many
such
details
but
these
things
are
no
proof
for
they
may
have
been
evidences
that
my
mind
was
not
as
usual
and
from
some
cause
or
another
i
had
certainly
been
much
upset
i
must
watch
for
proof
of
one
thing
i
am
glad
if
it
was
that
the
count
carried
me
here
and
undressed
me
he
must
have
been
hurried
in
his
task
for
my
pockets
are
intact
i
am
sure
this
diary
would
have
been
a
mystery
to
him
which
he
would
not
have
brooked
he
would
have
taken
or
destroyed
it
as
i
look
round
this
room
although
it
has
been
to
me
so
full
of
fear
it
is
now
a
sort
of
sanctuary
for
nothing
can
be
more
dreadful
than
those
awful
women
who
werewho

to
suck
my
blood





18
mayi
have
been
down
to
look
at
that
room
again
in
daylight
for
i
must
know
the
truth
when
i
got
to
the
doorway
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
found
it
closed
it
had
been
so
forcibly
driven
against
the
jamb
that
part
of
the
woodwork
was
splintered
i
could
see
that
the
bolt
of
the
lock
had
not
been
shot
but
the
door
is
fastened
from
the
inside
i
fear
it
was
no
dream
and
must
act
on
this
surmise





19
mayi
am
surely
in
the
toils
last
night
the
count
asked
me
in
the
suavest
tones
to
write
three
letters
one
saying
that
my
work
here
was
nearly
done
and
that
i
should
start
for
home
within
a
few
days
another
that
i
was
starting
on
the
next
morning
from
the
time
of
the
letter
and
the
third
that
i
had
left
the
castle
and
arrived
at
bistritz
i
would
fain
have
rebelled
but
felt
that
in
the
present
state
of
things
it
would
be
madness
to
quarrel
openly
with
the
count
whilst
i
am
so
absolutely
in
his
power
and
to
refuse
would
be
to
excite
his
suspicion
and
to
arouse
his
anger
he
knows
that
i
know
too
much
and
that
i
must
not
live
lest
i
be
dangerous
to
him
my
only
chance
is
to
prolong
my
opportunities
something
may
occur
which
will
give
me
a
chance
to
escape
i
saw
in
his
eyes
something
of
that
gathering
wrath
which
was
manifest
when
he
hurled
that
fair
woman
from
him
he
explained
to
me
that
posts
were
few
and
uncertain
and
that
my
writing
now
would
ensure
ease
of
mind
to
my
friends
and
he
assured
me
with
so
much
impressiveness
that
he
would
countermand
the
later
letters
which
would
be
held
over
at
bistritz
until
due
time
in
case
chance
would
admit
of
my
prolonging
my
stay
that
to
oppose
him
would
have
been
to
create
new
suspicion
i
therefore
pretended
to
fall
in
with
his
views
and
asked
him
what
dates
i
should
put
on
the
letters
he
calculated
a
minute
and
then
said
the
first
should
be
june
12
the
second
june
19
and
the
third
june
29

now

of
my
life

a
band
of
szgany
have
come
to
the
castle
and
are
encamped
in
the
courtyard
these
szgany
are
gipsies
i
have
notes
of
them
in
my
book
they
are
peculiar
to
this
part
of
the
world
though
allied
to
the
ordinary
gipsies
all
the
world
over
there
are
thousands
of
them
in
hungary
and
transylvania
who
are
almost
outside
all
law
they
attach
themselves
as
a
rule
to
some
great
noble
or
boyar
and
call
themselves
by
his
name
they
are
fearless
and
without
religion
save
superstition
and
they
talk
only
their
own
varieties
of
the
romany
tongue
i
shall
write
some
letters
home
and
shall
try
to
get
them
to
have
them
posted
i
have
already
spoken
them
through
my
window
to
begin
acquaintanceship
they
took
their
hats
off
and
made
obeisance
and
many
signs
which
however
i
could
not
understand
any
more
than
i
could
their
spoken
language





i
have
written
the
letters
minas
is
in
shorthand
and
i
simply
ask
mr
hawkins
to
communicate
with
her
to
her
i
have
explained
my
situation
but
without
the
horrors
which
i
may
only
surmise
it
would
shock
and
frighten
her
to
death
were
i
to
expose
my
heart
to
her
should
the
letters
not
carry
then
the
count
shall
not
yet
know
my
secret
or
the
extent
of
my
knowledge





i
have
given
the
letters
i
threw
them
through
the
bars
of
my
window
with
a
gold
piece
and
made
what
signs
i
could
to
have
them
posted
the
man
who
took
them
pressed
them
to
his
heart
and
bowed
and
then
put
them
in
his
cap
i
could
do
no
more
i
stole
back
to
the
study
and
began
to
read
as
the
count
did
not
come
in
i
have
written
here





the
count
has
come
he
sat
down
beside
me
and
said
in
his
smoothest
voice
as
he
opened
two
letters
the
szgany
has
given
me
these
of
which
though
i
know
not
whence
they
come
i
shall
of
course
take
care
seehe
must
have
looked
at
itone
is
from
you
and
to
my
friend
peter
hawkins
the
otherhere
he
caught
sight
of
the
strange
symbols
as
he
opened
the
envelope
and
the
dark
look
came
into
his
face
and
his
eyes
blazed
wickedlythe
other
is
a
vile
thing
an
outrage
upon
friendship
and
hospitality
it
is
not
signed
well
so
it
cannot
matter
to
us
and
he
calmly
held
letter
and
envelope
in
the
flame
of
the
lamp
till
they
were
consumed
then
he
went
on
the
letter
to
hawkinsthat
i
shall
of
course
send
on
since
it
is
yours
your
letters
are
sacred
to
me
your
pardon
my
friend
that
unknowingly
i
did
break
the
seal
will
you
not
cover
it
again
he
held
out
the
letter
to
me
and
with
a
courteous
bow
handed
me
a
clean
envelope
i
could
only
redirect
it
and
hand
it
to
him
in
silence
when
he
went
out
of
the
room
i
could
hear
the
key
turn
softly
a
minute
later
i
went
over
and
tried
it
and
the
door
was
locked
when
an
hour
or
two
after
the
count
came
quietly
into
the
room
his
coming
awakened
me
for
i
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
he
was
very
courteous
and
very
cheery
in
his
manner
and
seeing
that
i
had
been
sleeping
he
said
so
my
friend
you
are
tired
get
to
bed
there
is
the
surest
rest
i
may
not
have
the
pleasure
to
talk
tonight
since
there
are
many
labours
to
me
but
you
will
sleep
i
pray
i
passed
to
my
room
and
went
to
bed
and
strange
to
say
slept
without
dreaming
despair
has
its
own
calms





31
maythis
morning
when
i
woke
i
thought
i
would
provide
myself
with
some
paper
and
envelopes
from
my
bag
and
keep
them
in
my
pocket
so
that
i
might
write
in
case
i
should
get
an
opportunity
but
again
a
surprise
again
a
shock
every
scrap
of
paper
was
gone
and
with
it
all
my
notes
my
memoranda
relating
to
railways
and
travel
my
letter
of
credit
in
fact
all
that
might
be
useful
to
me
were
i
once
outside
the
castle
i
sat
and
pondered
awhile
and
then
some
thought
occurred
to
me
and
i
made
search
of
my
portmanteau
and
in
the
wardrobe
where
i
had
placed
my
clothes
the
suit
in
which
i
had
travelled
was
gone
and
also
my
overcoat
and
rug
i
could
find
no
trace
of
them
anywhere
this
looked
like
some
new
scheme
of
villainy





17
junethis
morning
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
cudgelling
my
brains
i
heard
without
a
cracking
of
whips
and
pounding
and
scraping
of
horses
feet
up
the
rocky
path
beyond
the
courtyard
with
joy
i
hurried
to
the
window
and
saw
drive
into
the
yard
two
great
leiterwagons
each
drawn
by
eight
sturdy
horses
and
at
the
head
of
each
pair
a
slovak
with
his
wide
hat
great
nailstudded
belt
dirty
sheepskin
and
high
boots
they
had
also
their
long
staves
in
hand
i
ran
to
the
door
intending
to
descend
and
try
and
join
them
through
the
main
hall
as
i
thought
that
way
might
be
opened
for
them
again
a
shock
my
door
was
fastened
on
the
outside
then
i
ran
to
the
window
and
cried
to
them
they
looked
up
at
me
stupidly
and
pointed
but
just
then
the
hetman
of
the
szgany
came
out
and
seeing
them
pointing
to
my
window
said
something
at
which
they
laughed
henceforth
no
effort
of
mine
no
piteous
cry
or
agonised
entreaty
would
make
them
even
look
at
me
they
resolutely
turned
away
the
leiterwagons
contained
great
square
boxes
with
handles
of
thick
rope
these
were
evidently
empty
by
the
ease
with
which
the
slovaks
handled
them
and
by
their
resonance
as
they
were
roughly
moved
when
they
were
all
unloaded
and
packed
in
a
great
heap
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
the
slovaks
were
given
some
money
by
the
szgany
and
spitting
on
it
for
luck
lazily
went
each
to
his
horses
head
shortly
afterwards
i
heard
the
cracking
of
their
whips
die
away
in
the
distance





24
june
before
morninglast
night
the
count
left
me
early
and
locked
himself
into
his
own
room
as
soon
as
i
dared
i
ran
up
the
winding
stair
and
looked
out
of
the
window
which
opened
south
i
thought
i
would
watch
for
the
count
for
there
is
something
going
on
the
szgany
are
quartered
somewhere
in
the
castle
and
are
doing
work
of
some
kind
i
know
it
for
now
and
then
i
hear
a
faraway
muffled
sound
as
of
mattock
and
spade
and
whatever
it
is
it
must
be
the
end
of
some
ruthless
villainy
i
had
been
at
the
window
somewhat
less
than
half
an
hour
when
i
saw
something
coming
out
of
the
counts
window
i
drew
back
and
watched
carefully
and
saw
the
whole
man
emerge
it
was
a
new
shock
to
me
to
find
that
he
had
on
the
suit
of
clothes
which
i
had
worn
whilst
travelling
here
and
slung
over
his
shoulder
the
terrible
bag
which
i
had
seen
the
women
take
away
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
his
quest
and
in
my
garb
too
this
then
is
his
new
scheme
of
evil
that
he
will
allow
others
to
see
me
as
they
think
so
that
he
may
both
leave
evidence
that
i
have
been
seen
in
the
towns
or
villages
posting
my
own
letters
and
that
any
wickedness
which
he
may
do
shall
by
the
local
people
be
attributed
to
me
it
makes
me
rage
to
think
that
this
can
go
on
and
whilst
i
am
shut
up
here
a
veritable
prisoner
but
without
that
protection
of
the
law
which
is
even
a
criminals
right
and
consolation
i
thought
i
would
watch
for
the
counts
return
and
for
a
long
time
sat
doggedly
at
the
window
then
i
began
to
notice
that
there
were
some
quaint
little
specks
floating
in
the
rays
of
the
moonlight
they
were
like
the
tiniest
grains
of
dust
and
they
whirled
round
and
gathered
in
clusters
in
a
nebulous
sort
of
way
i
watched
them
with
a
sense
of
soothing
and
a
sort
of
calm
stole
over
me
i
leaned
back
in
the
embrasure
in
a
more
comfortable
position
so
that
i
could
enjoy
more
fully
the
arial
gambolling
something
made
me
start
up
a
low
piteous
howling
of
dogs
somewhere
far
below
in
the
valley
which
was
hidden
from
my
sight
louder
it
seemed
to
ring
in
my
ears
and
the
floating
motes
of
dust
to
take
new
shapes
to
the
sound
as
they
danced
in
the
moonlight
i
felt
myself
struggling
to
awake
to
some
call
of
my
instincts
nay
my
very
soul
was
struggling
and
my
halfremembered
sensibilities
were
striving
to
answer
the
call
i
was
becoming
hypnotised
quicker
and
quicker
danced
the
dust
the
moonbeams
seemed
to
quiver
as
they
went
by
me
into
the
mass
of
gloom
beyond
more
and
more
they
gathered
till
they
seemed
to
take
dim
phantom
shapes
and
then
i
started
broad
awake
and
in
full
possession
of
my
senses
and
ran
screaming
from
the
place
the
phantom
shapes
which
were
becoming
gradually
materialised
from
the
moonbeams
were
those
of
the
three
ghostly
women
to
whom
i
was
doomed
i
fled
and
felt
somewhat
safer
in
my
own
room
where
there
was
no
moonlight
and
where
the
lamp
was
burning
brightly
when
a
couple
of
hours
had
passed
i
heard
something
stirring
in
the
counts
room
something
like
a
sharp
wail
quickly
suppressed
and
then
there
was
silence
deep
awful
silence
which
chilled
me
with
a
beating
heart
i
tried
the
door
but
i
was
locked
in
my
prison
and
could
do
nothing
i
sat
down
and
simply
cried
as
i
sat
i
heard
a
sound
in
the
courtyard
withoutthe
agonised
cry
of
a
woman
i
rushed
to
the
window
and
throwing
it
up
peered
out
between
the
bars
there
indeed
was
a
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
holding
her
hands
over
her
heart
as
one
distressed
with
running
she
was
leaning
against
a
corner
of
the
gateway
when
she
saw
my
face
at
the
window
she
threw
herself
forward
and
shouted
in
a
voice
laden
with
menace
monster
give
me
my
child
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
raising
up
her
hands
cried
the
same
words
in
tones
which
wrung
my
heart
then
she
tore
her
hair
and
beat
her
breast
and
abandoned
herself
to
all
the
violences
of
extravagant
emotion
finally
she
threw
herself
forward
and
though
i
could
not
see
her
i
could
hear
the
beating
of
her
naked
hands
against
the
door
somewhere
high
overhead
probably
on
the
tower
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
count
calling
in
his
harsh
metallic
whisper
his
call
seemed
to
be
answered
from
far
and
wide
by
the
howling
of
wolves
before
many
minutes
had
passed
a
pack
of
them
poured
like
a
pentup
dam
when
liberated
through
the
wide
entrance
into
the
courtyard
there
was
no
cry
from
the
woman
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
was
but
short
before
long
they
streamed
away
singly
licking
their
lips
i
could
not
pity
her
for
i
knew
now
what
had
become
of
her
child
and
she
was
better
dead
what
shall
i
do
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
escape
from
this
dreadful
thing
of
night
and
gloom
and
fear





25
june
morningno
man
knows
till
he
has
suffered
from
the
night
how
sweet
and
how
dear
to
his
heart
and
eye
the
morning
can
be
when
the
sun
grew
so
high
this
morning
that
it
struck
the
top
of
the
great
gateway
opposite
my
window
the
high
spot
which
it
touched
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
dove
from
the
ark
had
lighted
there
my
fear
fell
from
me
as
if
it
had
been
a
vaporous
garment
which
dissolved
in
the
warmth
i
must
take
action
of
some
sort
whilst
the
courage
of
the
day
is
upon
me
last
night
one
of
my
postdated
letters
went
to
post
the
first
of
that
fatal
series
which
is
to
blot
out
the
very
traces
of
my
existence
from
the
earth
let
me
not
think
of
it
action
it
has
always
been
at
nighttime
that
i
have
been
molested
or
threatened
or
in
some
way
in
danger
or
in
fear
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
count
in
the
daylight
can
it
be
that
he
sleeps
when
others
wake
that
he
may
be
awake
whilst
they
sleep
if
i
could
only
get
into
his
room
but
there
is
no
possible
way
the
door
is
always
locked
no
way
for
me
yes
there
is
a
way
if
one
dares
to
take
it
where
his
body
has
gone
why
may
not
another
body
go
i
have
seen
him
myself
crawl
from
his
window
why
should
not
i
imitate
him
and
go
in
by
his
window
the
chances
are
desperate
but
my
need
is
more
desperate
still
i
shall
risk
it
at
the
worst
it
can
only
be
death
and
a
mans
death
is
not
a
calfs
and
the
dreaded
hereafter
may
still
be
open
to
me
god
help
me
in
my
task
goodbye
mina
if
i
fail
goodbye
my
faithful
friend
and
second
father
goodbye
all
and
last
of
all
mina





same
day
lateri
have
made
the
effort
and
god
helping
me
have
come
safely
back
to
this
room
i
must
put
down
every
detail
in
order
i
went
whilst
my
courage
was
fresh
straight
to
the
window
on
the
south
side
and
at
once
got
outside
on
the
narrow
ledge
of
stone
which
runs
around
the
building
on
this
side
the
stones
are
big
and
roughly
cut
and
the
mortar
has
by
process
of
time
been
washed
away
between
them
i
took
off
my
boots
and
ventured
out
on
the
desperate
way
i
looked
down
once
so
as
to
make
sure
that
a
sudden
glimpse
of
the
awful
depth
would
not
overcome
me
but
after
that
kept
my
eyes
away
from
it
i
knew
pretty
well
the
direction
and
distance
of
the
counts
window
and
made
for
it
as
well
as
i
could
having
regard
to
the
opportunities
available
i
did
not
feel
dizzyi
suppose
i
was
too
excitedand
the
time
seemed
ridiculously
short
till
i
found
myself
standing
on
the
windowsill
and
trying
to
raise
up
the
sash
i
was
filled
with
agitation
however
when
i
bent
down
and
slid
feet
foremost
in
through
the
window
then
i
looked
around
for
the
count
but
with
surprise
and
gladness
made
a
discovery
the
room
was
empty
it
was
barely
furnished
with
odd
things
which
seemed
to
have
never
been
used
the
furniture
was
something
the
same
style
as
that
in
the
south
rooms
and
was
covered
with
dust
i
looked
for
the
key
but
it
was
not
in
the
lock
and
i
could
not
find
it
anywhere
the
only
thing
i
found
was
a
great
heap
of
gold
in
one
cornergold
of
all
kinds
roman
and
british
and
austrian
and
hungarian
and
greek
and
turkish
money
covered
with
a
film
of
dust
as
though
it
had
lain
long
in
the
ground
none
of
it
that
i
noticed
was
less
than
three
hundred
years
old
there
were
also
chains
and
ornaments
some
jewelled
but
all
of
them
old
and
stained
at
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
heavy
door
i
tried
it
for
since
i
could
not
find
the
key
of
the
room
or
the
key
of
the
outer
door
which
was
the
main
object
of
my
search
i
must
make
further
examination
or
all
my
efforts
would
be
in
vain
it
was
open
and
led
through
a
stone
passage
to
a
circular
stairway
which
went
steeply
down
i
descended
minding
carefully
where
i
went
for
the
stairs
were
dark
being
only
lit
by
loopholes
in
the
heavy
masonry
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
dark
tunnellike
passage
through
which
came
a
deathly
sickly
odour
the
odour
of
old
earth
newly
turned
as
i
went
through
the
passage
the
smell
grew
closer
and
heavier
at
last
i
pulled
open
a
heavy
door
which
stood
ajar
and
found
myself
in
an
old
ruined
chapel
which
had
evidently
been
used
as
a
graveyard
the
roof
was
broken
and
in
two
places
were
steps
leading
to
vaults
but
the
ground
had
recently
been
dug
over
and
the
earth
placed
in
great
wooden
boxes
manifestly
those
which
had
been
brought
by
the
slovaks
there
was
nobody
about
and
i
made
search
for
any
further
outlet
but
there
was
none
then
i
went
over
every
inch
of
the
ground
so
as
not
to
lose
a
chance
i
went
down
even
into
the
vaults
where
the
dim
light
struggled
although
to
do
so
was
a
dread
to
my
very
soul
into
two
of
these
i
went
but
saw
nothing
except
fragments
of
old
coffins
and
piles
of
dust
in
the
third
however
i
made
a
discovery
there
in
one
of
the
great
boxes
of
which
there
were
fifty
in
all
on
a
pile
of
newly
dug
earth
lay
the
count
he
was
either
dead
or
asleep
i
could
not
say
whichfor
the
eyes
were
open
and
stony
but
without
the
glassiness
of
deathand
the
cheeks
had
the
warmth
of
life
through
all
their
pallor
the
lips
were
as
red
as
ever
but
there
was
no
sign
of
movement
no
pulse
no
breath
no
beating
of
the
heart
i
bent
over
him
and
tried
to
find
any
sign
of
life
but
in
vain
he
could
not
have
lain
there
long
for
the
earthy
smell
would
have
passed
away
in
a
few
hours
by
the
side
of
the
box
was
its
cover
pierced
with
holes
here
and
there
i
thought
he
might
have
the
keys
on
him
but
when
i
went
to
search
i
saw
the
dead
eyes
and
in
them
dead
though
they
were
such
a
look
of
hate
though
unconscious
of
me
or
my
presence
that
i
fled
from
the
place
and
leaving
the
counts
room
by
the
window
crawled
again
up
the
castle
wall
regaining
my
room
i
threw
myself
panting
upon
the
bed
and
tried
to
think





29
junetoday
is
the
date
of
my
last
letter
and
the
count
has
taken
steps
to
prove
that
it
was
genuine
for
again
i
saw
him
leave
the
castle
by
the
same
window
and
in
my
clothes
as
he
went
down
the
wall
lizard
fashion
i
wished
i
had
a
gun
or
some
lethal
weapon
that
i
might
destroy
him
but
i
fear
that
no
weapon
wrought
alone
by
mans
hand
would
have
any
effect
on
him
i
dared
not
wait
to
see
him
return
for
i
feared
to
see
those
weird
sisters
i
came
back
to
the
library
and
read
there
till
i
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
by
the
count
who
looked
at
me
as
grimly
as
a
man
can
look
as
he
said
tomorrow
my
friend
we
must
part
you
return
to
your
beautiful
england
i
to
some
work
which
may
have
such
an
end
that
we
may
never
meet
your
letter
home
has
been
despatched
tomorrow
i
shall
not
be
here
but
all
shall
be
ready
for
your
journey
in
the
morning
come
the
szgany
who
have
some
labours
of
their
own
here
and
also
come
some
slovaks
when
they
have
gone
my
carriage
shall
come
for
you
and
shall
bear
you
to
the
borgo
pass
to
meet
the
diligence
from
bukovina
to
bistritz
but
i
am
in
hopes
that
i
shall
see
more
of
you
at
castle
dracula
i
suspected
him
and
determined
to
test
his
sincerity
sincerity
it
seems
like
a
profanation
of
the
word
to
write
it
in
connection
with
such
a
monster
so
asked
him
pointblank
why
may
i
not
go
tonight
because
dear
sir
my
coachman
and
horses
are
away
on
a
mission
but
i
would
walk
with
pleasure
i
want
to
get
away
at
once
he
smiled
such
a
soft
smooth
diabolical
smile
that
i
knew
there
was
some
trick
behind
his
smoothness
he
said
and
your
baggage
i
do
not
care
about
it
i
can
send
for
it
some
other
time
the
count
stood
up
and
said
with
a
sweet
courtesy
which
made
me
rub
my
eyes
it
seemed
so
real
you
english
have
a
saying
which
is
close
to
my
heart
for
its
spirit
is
that
which
rules
our
boyars
welcome
the
coming
speed
the
parting
guest
come
with
me
my
dear
young
friend
not
an
hour
shall
you
wait
in
my
house
against
your
will
though
sad
am
i
at
your
going
and
that
you
so
suddenly
desire
it
come
with
a
stately
gravity
he
with
the
lamp
preceded
me
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
hall
suddenly
he
stopped
hark
close
at
hand
came
the
howling
of
many
wolves
it
was
almost
as
if
the
sound
sprang
up
at
the
rising
of
his
hand
just
as
the
music
of
a
great
orchestra
seems
to
leap
under
the
bton
of
the
conductor
after
a
pause
of
a
moment
he
proceeded
in
his
stately
way
to
the
door
drew
back
the
ponderous
bolts
unhooked
the
heavy
chains
and
began
to
draw
it
open
to
my
intense
astonishment
i
saw
that
it
was
unlocked
suspiciously
i
looked
all
round
but
could
see
no
key
of
any
kind
as
the
door
began
to
open
the
howling
of
the
wolves
without
grew
louder
and
angrier
their
red
jaws
with
champing
teeth
and
their
bluntclawed
feet
as
they
leaped
came
in
through
the
opening
door
i
knew
then
that
to
struggle
at
the
moment
against
the
count
was
useless
with
such
allies
as
these
at
his
command
i
could
do
nothing
but
still
the
door
continued
slowly
to
open
and
only
the
counts
body
stood
in
the
gap
suddenly
it
struck
me
that
this
might
be
the
moment
and
means
of
my
doom
i
was
to
be
given
to
the
wolves
and
at
my
own
instigation
there
was
a
diabolical
wickedness
in
the
idea
great
enough
for
the
count
and
as
a
last
chance
i
cried
out
shut
the
door
i
shall
wait
till
morning
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
to
hide
my
tears
of
bitter
disappointment
with
one
sweep
of
his
powerful
arm
the
count
threw
the
door
shut
and
the
great
bolts
clanged
and
echoed
through
the
hall
as
they
shot
back
into
their
places
in
silence
we
returned
to
the
library
and
after
a
minute
or
two
i
went
to
my
own
room
the
last
i
saw
of
count
dracula
was
his
kissing
his
hand
to
me
with
a
red
light
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
and
with
a
smile
that
judas
in
hell
might
be
proud
of
when
i
was
in
my
room
and
about
to
lie
down
i
thought
i
heard
a
whispering
at
my
door
i
went
to
it
softly
and
listened
unless
my
ears
deceived
me
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
count
back
back
to
your
own
place
your
time
is
not
yet
come
wait
have
patience
tonight
is
mine
tomorrow
night
is
yours
there
was
a
low
sweet
ripple
of
laughter
and
in
a
rage
i
threw
open
the
door
and
saw
without
the
three
terrible
women
licking
their
lips
as
i
appeared
they
all
joined
in
a
horrible
laugh
and
ran
away
i
came
back
to
my
room
and
threw
myself
on
my
knees
it
is
then
so
near
the
end
tomorrow
tomorrow
lord
help
me
and
those
to
whom
i
am
dear





30
june
morningthese
may
be
the
last
words
i
ever
write
in
this
diary
i
slept
till
just
before
the
dawn
and
when
i
woke
threw
myself
on
my
knees
for
i
determined
that
if
death
came
he
should
find
me
ready
at
last
i
felt
that
subtle
change
in
the
air
and
knew
that
the
morning
had
come
then
came
the
welcome
cockcrow
and
i
felt
that
i
was
safe
with
a
glad
heart
i
opened
my
door
and
ran
down
to
the
hall
i
had
seen
that
the
door
was
unlocked
and
now
escape
was
before
me
with
hands
that
trembled
with
eagerness
i
unhooked
the
chains
and
drew
back
the
massive
bolts
but
the
door
would
not
move
despair
seized
me
i
pulled
and
pulled
at
the
door
and
shook
it
till
massive
as
it
was
it
rattled
in
its
casement
i
could
see
the
bolt
shot
it
had
been
locked
after
i
left
the
count
then
a
wild
desire
took
me
to
obtain
that
key
at
any
risk
and
i
determined
then
and
there
to
scale
the
wall
again
and
gain
the
counts
room
he
might
kill
me
but
death
now
seemed
the
happier
choice
of
evils
without
a
pause
i
rushed
up
to
the
east
window
and
scrambled
down
the
wall
as
before
into
the
counts
room
it
was
empty
but
that
was
as
i
expected
i
could
not
see
a
key
anywhere
but
the
heap
of
gold
remained
i
went
through
the
door
in
the
corner
and
down
the
winding
stair
and
along
the
dark
passage
to
the
old
chapel
i
knew
now
well
enough
where
to
find
the
monster
i
sought
the
great
box
was
in
the
same
place
close
against
the
wall
but
the
lid
was
laid
on
it
not
fastened
down
but
with
the
nails
ready
in
their
places
to
be
hammered
home
i
knew
i
must
reach
the
body
for
the
key
so
i
raised
the
lid
and
laid
it
back
against
the
wall
and
then
i
saw
something
which
filled
my
very
soul
with
horror
there
lay
the
count
but
looking
as
if
his
youth
had
been
half
renewed
for
the
white
hair
and
moustache
were
changed
to
dark
irongrey
the
cheeks
were
fuller
and
the
white
skin
seemed
rubyred
underneath
the
mouth
was
redder
than
ever
for
on
the
lips
were
gouts
of
fresh
blood
which
trickled
from
the
corners
of
the
mouth
and
ran
over
the
chin
and
neck
even
the
deep
burning
eyes
seemed
set
amongst
swollen
flesh
for
the
lids
and
pouches
underneath
were
bloated
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
awful
creature
were
simply
gorged
with
blood
he
lay
like
a
filthy
leech
exhausted
with
his
repletion
i
shuddered
as
i
bent
over
to
touch
him
and
every
sense
in
me
revolted
at
the
contact
but
i
had
to
search
or
i
was
lost
the
coming
night
might
see
my
own
body
a
banquet
in
a
similar
way
to
those
horrid
three
i
felt
all
over
the
body
but
no
sign
could
i
find
of
the
key
then
i
stopped
and
looked
at
the
count
there
was
a
mocking
smile
on
the
bloated
face
which
seemed
to
drive
me
mad
this
was
the
being
i
was
helping
to
transfer
to
london
where
perhaps
for
centuries
to
come
he
might
amongst
its
teeming
millions
satiate
his
lust
for
blood
and
create
a
new
and
everwidening
circle
of
semidemons
to
batten
on
the
helpless
the
very
thought
drove
me
mad
a
terrible
desire
came
upon
me
to
rid
the
world
of
such
a
monster
there
was
no
lethal
weapon
at
hand
but
i
seized
a
shovel
which
the
workmen
had
been
using
to
fill
the
cases
and
lifting
it
high
struck
with
the
edge
downward
at
the
hateful
face
but
as
i
did
so
the
head
turned
and
the
eyes
fell
full
upon
me
with
all
their
blaze
of
basilisk
horror
the
sight
seemed
to
paralyse
me
and
the
shovel
turned
in
my
hand
and
glanced
from
the
face
merely
making
a
deep
gash
above
the
forehead
the
shovel
fell
from
my
hand
across
the
box
and
as
i
pulled
it
away
the
flange
of
the
blade
caught
the
edge
of
the
lid
which
fell
over
again
and
hid
the
horrid
thing
from
my
sight
the
last
glimpse
i
had
was
of
the
bloated
face
bloodstained
and
fixed
with
a
grin
of
malice
which
would
have
held
its
own
in
the
nethermost
hell
i
thought
and
thought
what
should
be
my
next
move
but
my
brain
seemed
on
fire
and
i
waited
with
a
despairing
feeling
growing
over
me
as
i
waited
i
heard
in
the
distance
a
gipsy
song
sung
by
merry
voices
coming
closer
and
through
their
song
the
rolling
of
heavy
wheels
and
the
cracking
of
whips
the
szgany
and
the
slovaks
of
whom
the
count
had
spoken
were
coming
with
a
last
look
around
and
at
the
box
which
contained
the
vile
body
i
ran
from
the
place
and
gained
the
counts
room
determined
to
rush
out
at
the
moment
the
door
should
be
opened
with
strained
ears
i
listened
and
heard
downstairs
the
grinding
of
the
key
in
the
great
lock
and
the
falling
back
of
the
heavy
door
there
must
have
been
some
other
means
of
entry
or
some
one
had
a
key
for
one
of
the
locked
doors
then
there
came
the
sound
of
many
feet
tramping
and
dying
away
in
some
passage
which
sent
up
a
clanging
echo
i
turned
to
run
down
again
towards
the
vault
where
i
might
find
the
new
entrance
but
at
the
moment
there
seemed
to
come
a
violent
puff
of
wind
and
the
door
to
the
winding
stair
blew
to
with
a
shock
that
set
the
dust
from
the
lintels
flying
when
i
ran
to
push
it
open
i
found
that
it
was
hopelessly
fast
i
was
again
a
prisoner
and
the
net
of
doom
was
closing
round
me
more
closely
as
i
write
there
is
in
the
passage
below
a
sound
of
many
tramping
feet
and
the
crash
of
weights
being
set
down
heavily
doubtless
the
boxes
with
their
freight
of
earth
there
is
a
sound
of
hammering
it
is
the
box
being
nailed
down
now
i
can
hear
the
heavy
feet
tramping
again
along
the
hall
with
many
other
idle
feet
coming
behind
them
the
door
is
shut
and
the
chains
rattle
there
is
a
grinding
of
the
key
in
the
lock
i
can
hear
the
key
withdraw
then
another
door
opens
and
shuts
i
hear
the
creaking
of
lock
and
bolt
hark
in
the
courtyard
and
down
the
rocky
way
the
roll
of
heavy
wheels
the
crack
of
whips
and
the
chorus
of
the
szgany
as
they
pass
into
the
distance
i
am
alone
in
the
castle
with
those
awful
women
faugh
mina
is
a
woman
and
there
is
nought
in
common
they
are
devils
of
the
pit
i
shall
not
remain
alone
with
them
i
shall
try
to
scale
the
castle
wall
farther
than
i
have
yet
attempted
i
shall
take
some
of
the
gold
with
me
lest
i
want
it
later
i
may
find
a
way
from
this
dreadful
place
and
then
away
for
home
away
to
the
quickest
and
nearest
train
away
from
this
cursed
spot
from
this
cursed
land
where
the
devil
and
his
children
still
walk
with
earthly
feet
at
least
gods
mercy
is
better
than
that
of
these
monsters
and
the
precipice
is
steep
and
high
at
its
foot

may
my
dearest
lucy
forgive
my
long
delay
in
writing
but
i
have
been
simply
overwhelmed
with
work
the
life
of
an
assistant
schoolmistress
is
sometimes
trying
i
am
longing
to
be
with
you
and
by
the
sea
where
we
can
talk
together
freely
and
build
our
castles
in
the
air
i
have
been
working
very
hard
lately
because
i
want
to
keep
up
with
jonathans
studies
and
i
have
been
practising
shorthand
very
assiduously
when
we
are
married
i
shall
be
able
to
be
useful
to
jonathan
and
if
i
can
stenograph
well
enough
i
can
take
down
what
he
wants
to
say
in
this
way
and
write
it
out
for
him
on
the
typewriter
at
which
also
i
am
practising
very
hard
he
and
i
sometimes
write
letters
in
shorthand
and
he
is
keeping
a
stenographic
journal
of
his
travels
abroad
when
i
am
with
you
i
shall
keep
a
diary
in
the
same
way
i
dont
mean
one
of
those
twopagestotheweekwithsundaysqueezedinacorner
diaries
but
a
sort
of
journal
which
i
can
write
in
whenever
i
feel
inclined
i
do
not
suppose
there
will
be
much
of
interest
to
other
people
but
it
is
not
intended
for
them
i
may
show
it
to
jonathan
some
day
if
there
is
in
it
anything
worth
sharing
but
it
is
really
an
exercise
book
i
shall
try
to
do
what
i
see
lady
journalists
do
interviewing
and
writing
descriptions
and
trying
to
remember
conversations
i
am
told
that
with
a
little
practice
one
can
remember
all
that
goes
on
or
that
one
hears
said
during
a
day
however
we
shall
see
i
will
tell
you
of
my
little
plans
when
we
meet
i
have
just
had
a
few
hurried
lines
from
jonathan
from
transylvania
he
is
well
and
will
be
returning
in
about
a
week
i
am
longing
to
hear
all
his
news
it
must
be
so
nice
to
see
strange
countries
i
wonder
if
wei
mean
jonathan
and
ishall
ever
see
them
together
there
is
the
ten
oclock
bell
ringing
goodbye
your
loving
mina
tell
me
all
the
news
when
you
write
you
have
not
told
me
anything
for
a
long
time
i
hear
rumours
and
especially
of
a
tall
handsome
curlyhaired
man

chatham
street
wednesday
my
dearest
mina
i
must
say
you
tax
me
very
unfairly
with
being
a
bad
correspondent
i
wrote
to
you
twice
since
we
parted
and
your
last
letter
was
only
your
second
besides
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
there
is
really
nothing
to
interest
you
town
is
very
pleasant
just
now
and
we
go
a
good
deal
to
picturegalleries
and
for
walks
and
rides
in
the
park
as
to
the
tall
curlyhaired
man
i
suppose
it
was
the
one
who
was
with
me
at
the
last
pop
some
one
has
evidently
been
telling
tales
that
was
mr
holmwood
he
often
comes
to
see
us
and
he
and
mamma
get
on
very
well
together
they
have
so
many
things
to
talk
about
in
common
we
met
some
time
ago
a
man
that
would
just
do
for
you
if
you
were
not
already
engaged
to
jonathan
he
is
an
excellent
parti
being
handsome
well
off
and
of
good
birth
he
is
a
doctor
and
really
clever
just
fancy
he
is
only
nineandtwenty
and
he
has
an
immense
lunatic
asylum
all
under
his
own
care
mr
holmwood
introduced
him
to
me
and
he
called
here
to
see
us
and
often
comes
now
i
think
he
is
one
of
the
most
resolute
men
i
ever
saw
and
yet
the
most
calm
he
seems
absolutely
imperturbable
i
can
fancy
what
a
wonderful
power
he
must
have
over
his
patients
he
has
a
curious
habit
of
looking
one
straight
in
the
face
as
if
trying
to
read
ones
thoughts
he
tries
this
on
very
much
with
me
but
i
flatter
myself
he
has
got
a
tough
nut
to
crack
i
know
that
from
my
glass
do
you
ever
try
to
read
your
own
face
i
do
and
i
can
tell
you
it
is
not
a
bad
study
and
gives
you
more
trouble
than
you
can
well
fancy
if
you
have
never
tried
it
he
says
that
i
afford
him
a
curious
psychological
study
and
i
humbly
think
i
do
i
do
not
as
you
know
take
sufficient
interest
in
dress
to
be
able
to
describe
the
new
fashions
dress
is
a
bore
that
is
slang
again
but
never
mind
arthur
says
that
every
day
there
it
is
all
out

together
and
eaten
together

by
the
fire

am
writing
this
even

24
may
my
dearest
mina
thanks
and
thanks
and
thanks
again
for
your
sweet
letter
it
was
so
nice
to
be
able
to
tell
you
and
to
have
your
sympathy
my
dear
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
how
true
the
old
proverbs
are
here
am
i
who
shall
be
twenty
in
september
and
yet
i
never
had
a
proposal
till
today
not
a
real
proposal
and
today
i
have
had
three
just
fancy
three
proposals
in
one
day
isnt
it
awful
i
feel
sorry
really
and
truly
sorry
for
two
of
the
poor
fellows
oh
mina
i
am
so
happy
that
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
myself
and
three
proposals
but
for
goodness
sake
dont
tell
any
of
the
girls
or
they
would
be
getting
all
sorts
of
extravagant
ideas
and
imagining
themselves
injured
and
slighted
if
in
their
very
first
day
at
home
they
did
not
get
six
at
least
some
girls
are
so
vain
you
and
i
mina
dear
who
are
engaged
and
are
going
to
settle
down
soon
soberly
into
old
married
women
can
despise
vanity
well
i
must
tell
you
about
the
three
but
you
must
keep
it
a
secret
dear
from
every
one
except
of
course
jonathan
you
will
tell
him
because
i
would
if
i
were
in
your
place
certainly
tell
arthur
a
woman
ought
to
tell
her
husband
everythingdont
you
think
so
dearand
i
must
be
fair
men
like
women
certainly
their
wives
to
be
quite
as
fair
as
they
are
and
women
i
am
afraid
are
not
always
quite
as
fair
as
they
should
be
well
my
dear
number
one
came
just
before
lunch
i
told
you
of
him
dr
john
seward
the
lunaticasylum
man
with
the
strong
jaw
and
the
good
forehead
he
was
very
cool
outwardly
but
was
nervous
all
the
same
he
had
evidently
been
schooling
himself
as
to
all
sorts
of
little
things
and
remembered
them
but
he
almost
managed
to
sit
down
on
his
silk
hat
which
men
dont
generally
do
when
they
are
cool
and
then
when
he
wanted
to
appear
at
ease
he
kept
playing
with
a
lancet
in
a
way
that
made
me
nearly
scream
he
spoke
to
me
mina
very
straightforwardly
he
told
me
how
dear
i
was
to
him
though
he
had
known
me
so
little
and
what
his
life
would
be
with
me
to
help
and
cheer
him
he
was
going
to
tell
me
how
unhappy
he
would
be
if
i
did
not
care
for
him
but
when
he
saw
me
cry
he
said
that
he
was
a
brute
and
would
not
add
to
my
present
trouble
then
he
broke
off
and
asked
if
i
could
love
him
in
time
and
when
i
shook
my
head
his
hands
trembled
and
then
with
some
hesitation
he
asked
me
if
i
cared
already
for
any
one
else
he
put
it
very
nicely
saying
that
he
did
not
want
to
wring
my
confidence
from
me
but
only
to
know
because
if
a
womans
heart
was
free
a
man
might
have
hope
and
then
mina
i
felt
a
sort
of
duty
to
tell
him
that
there
was
some
one
i
only
told
him
that
much
and
then
he
stood
up
and
he
looked
very
strong
and
very
grave
as
he
took
both
my
hands
in
his
and
said
he
hoped
i
would
be
happy
and
that
if
i
ever
wanted
a
friend
i
must
count
him
one
of
my
best
oh
mina
dear
i
cant
help
crying
and
you
must
excuse
this
letter
being
all
blotted
being
proposed
to
is
all
very
nice
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
it
isnt
at
all
a
happy
thing
when
you
have
to
see
a
poor
fellow
whom
you
know
loves
you
honestly
going
away
and
looking
all
brokenhearted
and
to
know
that
no
matter
what
he
may
say
at
the
moment
you
are
passing
quite
out
of
his
life
my
dear
i
must
stop
here
at
present
i
feel
so
miserable
though
i
am
so
happy
evening
arthur
has
just
gone
and
i
feel
in
better
spirits
than
when
i
left
off
so
i
can
go
on
telling
you
about
the
day
well
my
dear
number
two
came
after
lunch
he
is
such
a
nice
fellow
an
american
from
texas
and
he
looks
so
young
and
so
fresh
that
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
he
has
been
to
so
many
places
and
has
had
such
adventures
i
sympathise
with
poor
desdemona
when
she
had
such
a
dangerous
stream
poured
in
her
ear
even
by
a
black
man
i
suppose
that
we
women
are
such
cowards
that
we
think
a
man
will
save
us
from
fears
and
we
marry
him
i
know
now
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
a
man
and
wanted
to
make
a
girl
love
me
no
i
dont
for
there
was
mr
morris
telling
us
his
stories
and
arthur
never
told
any
and
yet
my
dear
i
am
somewhat
previous
mr
quincey
p
morris
found
me
alone
it
seems
that
a
man
always
does
find
a
girl
alone
no
he
doesnt
for
arthur
tried
twice
to
make
a
chance
and
i
helping
him
all
i
could
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
it
now
i
must
tell
you
beforehand
that
mr
morris
doesnt
always
speak
slangthat
is
to
say
he
never
does
so
to
strangers
or
before
them
for
he
is
really
well
educated
and
has
exquisite
mannersbut
he
found
out
that
it
amused
me
to
hear
him
talk
american
slang
and
whenever
i
was
present
and
there
was
no
one
to
be
shocked
he
said
such
funny
things
i
am
afraid
my
dear
he
has
to
invent
it
all
for
it
fits
exactly
into
whatever
else
he
has
to
say
but
this
is
a
way
slang
has
i
do
not
know
myself
if
i
shall
ever
speak
slang
i
do
not
know
if
arthur
likes
it
as
i
have
never
heard
him
use
any
as
yet
well
mr
morris
sat
down
beside
me
and
looked
as
happy
and
jolly
as
he
could
but
i
could
see
all
the
same
that
he
was
very
nervous
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
said
ever
so
sweetly
miss
lucy
i
know
i
aint
good
enough
to
regulate
the
fixins
of
your
little
shoes
but
i
guess
if
you
wait
till
you
find
a
man
that
is
you
will
go
join
them
seven
young
women
with
the
lamps
when
you
quit
wont
you
just
hitch
up
alongside
of
me
and
let
us
go
down
the
long
road
together
driving
in
double
harness
well
he
did
look
so
goodhumoured
and
so
jolly
that
it
didnt
seem
half
so
hard
to
refuse
him
as
it
did
poor
dr
seward
so
i
said
as
lightly
as
i
could
that
i
did
not
know
anything
of
hitching
and
that
i
wasnt
broken
to
harness
at
all
yet
then
he
said
that
he
had
spoken
in
a
light
manner
and
he
hoped
that
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
doing
so
on
so
grave
so
momentous
an
occasion
for
him
i
would
forgive
him
he
really
did
look
serious
when
he
was
saying
it
and
i
couldnt
help
feeling
a
bit
serious
tooi
know
mina
you
will
think
me
a
horrid
flirtthough
i
couldnt
help
feeling
a
sort
of
exultation
that
he
was
number
two
in
one
day
and
then
my
dear
before
i
could
say
a
word
he
began
pouring
out
a
perfect
torrent
of
lovemaking
laying
his
very
heart
and
soul
at
my
feet
he
looked
so
earnest
over
it
that
i
shall
never
again
think
that
a
man
must
be
playful
always
and
never
earnest
because
he
is
merry
at
times
i
suppose
he
saw
something
in
my
face
which
checked
him
for
he
suddenly
stopped
and
said
with
a
sort
of
manly
fervour
that
i
could
have
loved
him
for
if
i
had
been
free
lucy
you
are
an
honesthearted
girl
i
know
i
should
not
be
here
speaking
to
you
as
i
am
now
if
i
did
not
believe
you
clean
grit
right
through
to
the
very
depths
of
your
soul
tell
me
like
one
good
fellow
to
another
is
there
any
one
else
that
you
care
for
and
if
there
is
ill
never
trouble
you
a
hairs
breadth
again
but
will
be
if
you
will
let
me
a
very
faithful
friend
my
dear
mina
why
are
men
so
noble
when
we
women
are
so
little
worthy
of
them
here
was
i
almost
making
fun
of
this
greathearted
true
gentleman
i
burst
into
tearsi
am
afraid
my
dear
you
will
think
this
a
very
sloppy
letter
in
more
ways
than
oneand
i
really
felt
very
badly
why
cant
they
let
a
girl
marry
three
men
or
as
many
as
want
her
and
save
all
this
trouble
but
this
is
heresy
and
i
must
not
say
it
i
am
glad
to
say
that
though
i
was
crying
i
was
able
to
look
into
mr
morriss
brave
eyes
and
i
told
him
out
straight
yes
there
is
some
one
i
love
though
he
has
not
told
me
yet
that
he
even
loves
me
i
was
right
to
speak
to
him
so
frankly
for
quite
a
light
came
into
his
face
and
he
put
out
both
his
hands
and
took
minei
think
i
put
them
into
hisand
said
in
a
hearty
way
thats
my
brave
girl
its
better
worth
being
late
for
a
chance
of
winning
you
than
being
in
time
for
any
other
girl
in
the
world
dont
cry
my
dear
if
its
for
me
im
a
hard
nut
to
crack
and
i
take
it
standing
up
if
that
other
fellow
doesnt
know
his
happiness
well
hed
better
look
for
it
soon
or
hell
have
to
deal
with
me
little
girl
your
honesty
and
pluck
have
made
me
a
friend
and
thats
rarer
than
a
lover
its
more
unselfish
anyhow
my
dear
im
going
to
have
a
pretty
lonely
walk
between
this
and
kingdom
come
wont
you
give
me
one
kiss
itll
be
something
to
keep
off
the
darkness
now
and
then
you
can
you
know
if
you
like
for
that
other
good
fellowhe
must
be
a
good
fellow
my
dear
and
a
fine
fellow
or
you
could
not
love
himhasnt
spoken
yet
that
quite
won
me
mina
for
it
was
brave
and
sweet
of
him
and
noble
too
to
a
rivalwasnt
itand
he
so
sad
so
i
leant
over
and
kissed
him
he
stood
up
with
my
two
hands
in
his
and
as
he
looked
down
into
my
facei
am
afraid
i
was
blushing
very
muchhe
said
little
girl
i
hold
your
hand
and
youve
kissed
me
and
if
these
things
dont
make
us
friends
nothing
ever
will
thank
you
for
your
sweet
honesty
to
me
and
goodbye
he
wrung
my
hand
and
taking
up
his
hat
went
straight
out
of
the
room
without
looking
back
without
a
tear
or
a
quiver
or
a
pause
and
i
am
crying
like
a
baby
oh
why
must
a
man
like
that
be
made
unhappy
when
there
are
lots
of
girls
about
who
would
worship
the
very
ground
he
trod
on
i
know
i
would
if
i
were
freeonly
i
dont
want
to
be
free
my
dear
this
quite
upset
me
and
i
feel
i
cannot
write
of
happiness
just
at
once
after
telling
you
of
it
and
i
dont
wish
to
tell
of
the
number
three
until
it
can
be
all
happy
ever

threei
neednt
tell

i
besides
it
was
all
so
confused
it
seemed
only
a
moment
from
his
coming
into
the
room
till
both
his
arms
were
round
me
and
he
was
kissing
me
i
am
very
very
happy
and
i
dont
know
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
it
i
must
only
try
in
the
future
to
show
that
i
am
not
ungrateful
to
god
for
all
his
goodness

me
in
sending

the

for
this
sort

thing
was
work
i
went
down

the

i
picked
out
one
who
has
afforded
me
a
study
of
much
interest
he
is
so
quaint

today

seemed

get
nearer
than
ever

the

i
had
ever
done
with
a
view
to
making
myself

the

his

in
my
manner

it
there
was
i
now
see
something
of
cruelty
i
seemed
to
wish
to
keep
him
to
the
point
of
his

which
i
avoid

july
whitbylucy
met
me
at
the
station
looking
sweeter
and
lovelier
than
ever
and
we
drove
up
to
the
house
at
the
crescent
in
which
they
have
rooms
this
is
a
lovely
place
the
little
river
the
esk
runs
through
a
deep
valley
which
broadens
out
as
it
comes
near
the
harbour
a
great
viaduct
runs
across
with
high
piers
through
which
the
view
seems
somehow
further
away
than
it
really
is
the
valley
is
beautifully
green
and
it
is
so
steep
that
when
you
are
on
the
high
land
on
either
side
you
look
right
across
it
unless
you
are
near
enough
to
see
down
the
houses
of
the
old
townthe
side
away
from
usare
all
redroofed
and
seem
piled
up
one
over
the
other
anyhow
like
the
pictures
we
see
of
nuremberg
right
over
the
town
is
the
ruin
of
whitby
abbey
which
was
sacked
by
the
danes
and
which
is
the
scene
of
part
of
marmion
where
the
girl
was
built
up
in
the
wall
it
is
a
most
noble
ruin
of
immense
size
and
full
of
beautiful
and
romantic
bits
there
is
a
legend
that
a
white
lady
is
seen
in
one
of
the
windows
between
it
and
the
town
there
is
another
church
the
parish
one
round
which
is
a
big
graveyard
all
full
of
tombstones
this
is
to
my
mind
the
nicest
spot
in
whitby
for
it
lies
right
over
the
town
and
has
a
full
view
of
the
harbour
and
all
up
the
bay
to
where
the
headland
called
kettleness
stretches
out
into
the
sea
it
descends
so
steeply
over
the
harbour
that
part
of
the
bank
has
fallen
away
and
some
of
the
graves
have
been
destroyed
in
one
place
part
of
the
stonework
of
the
graves
stretches
out
over
the
sandy
pathway
far
below
there
are
walks
with
seats
beside
them
through
the
churchyard
and
people
go
and
sit
there
all
day
long
looking
at
the
beautiful
view
and
enjoying
the
breeze
i
shall
come
and
sit
here
very
often
myself
and
work
indeed
i
am
writing
now
with
my
book
on
my
knee
and
listening
to
the
talk
of
three
old
men
who
are
sitting
beside
me
they
seem
to
do
nothing
all
day
but
sit
up
here
and
talk
the
harbour
lies
below
me
with
on
the
far
side
one
long
granite
wall
stretching
out
into
the
sea
with
a
curve
outwards
at
the
end
of
it
in
the
middle
of
which
is
a
lighthouse
a
heavy
seawall
runs
along
outside
of
it
on
the
near
side
the
seawall
makes
an
elbow
crooked
inversely
and
its
end
too
has
a
lighthouse
between
the
two
piers
there
is
a
narrow
opening
into
the
harbour
which
then
suddenly
widens
it
is
nice
at
high
water
but
when
the
tide
is
out
it
shoals
away
to
nothing
and
there
is
merely
the
stream
of
the
esk
running
between
banks
of
sand
with
rocks
here
and
there
outside
the
harbour
on
this
side
there
rises
for
about
half
a
mile
a
great
reef
the
sharp
edge
of
which
runs
straight
out
from
behind
the
south
lighthouse
at
the
end
of
it
is
a
buoy
with
a
bell
which
swings
in
bad
weather
and
sends
in
a
mournful
sound
on
the
wind
they
have
a
legend
here
that
when
a
ship
is
lost
bells
are
heard
out
at
sea
i
must
ask
the
old
man
about
this
he
is
coming
this
way
he
is
a
funny
old
man
he
must
be
awfully
old
for
his
face
is
all
gnarled
and
twisted
like
the
bark
of
a
tree
he
tells
me
that
he
is
nearly
a
hundred
and
that
he
was
a
sailor
in
the
greenland
fishing
fleet
when
waterloo
was
fought
he
is
i
am
afraid
a
very
sceptical
person
for
when
i
asked
him
about
the
bells
at
sea
and
the
white
lady
at
the
abbey
he
said
very
brusquely
i
wouldnt
fash
masel
about
them
miss
them
things
be
all
wore
out
mind
i
dont
say
that
they
never
was
but
i
do
say
that
they
wasnt
in
my
time
they
be
all
very
well
for
comers
and
trippers
an
the
like
but
not
for
a
nice
young
lady
like
you
them
feetfolks
from
york
and
leeds
that
be
always
eatin
cured
herrins
an
drinkin
tea
an
lookin
out
to
buy
cheap
jet
would
creed
aught
i
wonder
masel
whod
be
bothered
tellin
lies
to
themeven
the
newspapers
which
is
full
of
fooltalk
i
thought
he
would
be
a
good
person
to
learn
interesting
things
from
so
i
asked
him
if
he
would
mind
telling
me
something
about
the
whalefishing
in
the
old
days
he
was
just
settling
himself
to
begin
when
the
clock
struck
six
whereupon
he
laboured
to
get
up
and
said
i
must
gang
ageeanwards
home
now
miss
my
granddaughter
doesnt
like
to
be
kept
waitin
when
the
tea
is
ready
for
it
takes
me
time
to
crammle
aboon
the
grees
for
there
be
a
many
of
em
an
miss
i
lack
bellytimber
sairly
by
the
clock
he
hobbled
away
and
i
could
see
him
hurrying
as
well
as
he
could
down
the
steps
the
steps
are
a
great
feature
on
the
place
they
lead
from
the
town
up
to
the
church
there
are
hundreds
of
themi
do
not
know
how
manyand
they
wind
up
in
a
delicate
curve
the
slope
is
so
gentle
that
a
horse
could
easily
walk
up
and
down
them
i
think
they
must
originally
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
abbey
i
shall
go
home
too
lucy
went
out
visiting
with
her
mother
and
as
they
were
only
duty
calls
i
did
not
go
they
will
be
home
by
this





1
augusti
came
up
here
an
hour
ago
with
lucy
and
we
had
a
most
interesting
talk
with
my
old
friend
and
the
two
others
who
always
come
and
join
him
he
is
evidently
the
sir
oracle
of
them
and
i
should
think
must
have
been
in
his
time
a
most
dictatorial
person
he
will
not
admit
anything
and
downfaces
everybody
if
he
cant
outargue
them
he
bullies
them
and
then
takes
their
silence
for
agreement
with
his
views
lucy
was
looking
sweetly
pretty
in
her
white
lawn
frock
she
has
got
a
beautiful
colour
since
she
has
been
here
i
noticed
that
the
old
men
did
not
lose
any
time
in
coming
up
and
sitting
near
her
when
we
sat
down
she
is
so
sweet
with
old
people
i
think
they
all
fell
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
even
my
old
man
succumbed
and
did
not
contradict
her
but
gave
me
double
share
instead
i
got
him
on
the
subject
of
the
legends
and
he
went
off
at
once
into
a
sort
of
sermon
i
must
try
to
remember
it
and
put
it
down
it
be
all
fooltalk

to

me
ireful

yet
in

half
of
them

less
sacred
lies
all
of
them
nothin
but
lies
of
one
kind
or
another
my
gog
but
itll
be
a
quare
scowderment
at
the
day
of
judgment
when
they
come
tumblin
up
in
their
deathsarks
all
jouped
together
an
tryin
to
drag
their
tombsteans
with
them
to
prove
how
good
they
was
some
of
them
trimmlin
and
ditherin
with
their
hands
that
dozzened
an
slippy
from
lyin
in
the
sea
that
they
cant
even
keep
their
grup
o
them
i
could
see
from
the
old
fellows
selfsatisfied
air
and
the
way
in
which
he
looked
round
for
the
approval
of
his
cronies
that
he
was
showing
off
so
i
put
in
a
word
to
keep
him
going
oh
mr
swales
you
cant
be
serious
surely
these
tombstones
are
not
all
wrong
yabblins
there
may
be
a
poorish
few
not
wrong
savin
where
they
make
out
the
people
too
good
for
there
be
folk
that
do
think
a
balmbowl
be
like
the
sea
if
only
it
be
their
own
the
whole
thing
be
only
lies
now
look
you
here
you
come
here
a
stranger
an
you
see
this
kirkgarth
i
nodded
for
i
thought
it
better
to
assent
though
i
did
not
quite
understand
his
dialect
i
knew
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
church
he
went
on
and
you
consate
that
all
these
steans
be
aboon
folk
that
be
happed
here
snod
an
snog
i
assented
again
then
that
be
just
where
the
lie
comes
in
why
there
be
scores
of
these
laybeds
that
be
toom
as
old
duns
baccabox
on
friday
night
he
nudged
one
of
his
companions
and
they
all
laughed
and
my
gog
how
could
they
be
otherwise
look
at
that
one
the
aftest
abaft
the
bierbank
read
it
i
went
over
and
read

murdered
by
pirates
off

t

when
i
came
back
mr
swales
went
on
who
brought
him
home
i
wonder
to
hap
him
here
murdered
off
the
coast
of
andres
an
you
consated
his
body
lay
under

theyd

jommlin
an
jostlin
one
another
that
way
that
it
ud
be
like
a
fight
up
on
the
ice
in
the
old
days
when
wed
be
at
one
another
from
daylight
to
dark
an
tryin
to
tie
up
our
cuts
by
the
light
of
the
aurora
borealis
this
was
evidently
local
pleasantry
for
the
old
man
cackled
over
it
and
his
cronies
joined
in
with
gusto
but
i
said
surely
you
are
not
quite
correct
for
you
start
on
the
assumption
that
all
the
poor
people
or
their
spirits
will
have
to
take
their
tombstones
with
them
on
the
day
of
judgment
do
you
think
that
will
be
really
necessary
well
what
else
be
they
tombstones
for
answer
me
that
miss
to
please
their
relatives
i
suppose
to
please
their
relatives
you
suppose
this
he
said
with
intense
scorn
how
will
it
pleasure
their
relatives
to
know
that
lies
is
wrote
over
them
and
that
everybody
in
the
place
knows
that
they
be
lies
he
pointed
to
a
stone
at
our
feet
which
had
been
laid
down
as
a
slab
on
which
the
seat
was
rested
close
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
read
the
lies
on
that
thruffstean
he
said
the
letters
were
upside
down
to
me
from
where
i
sat
but
lucy
was
more
opposite
to
them
so
she
leant
over
and
read
sacred
to
the
memory
of
george
canon
who
died
in
the
hope
of
a
glorious
resurrection
on
july

1873
falling
from
the
rocks

erected
by
his
sorrowing
mother
to
her
dearly
beloved
son
he
was
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
was
a
widow
really
mr
swales
i
dont
see
anything
very
funny
in
that
she
spoke
her
comment
very
gravely
and
somewhat
severely
ye
dont
see
aught
funny
ha

but
thats
because
ye
dont
gawm
the

wasan
he
hated
her
so
that
he
committed
suicide
in
order
that
she
mightnt
get
an
insurance
she
put
on
his
life
he
blew
nigh
the
top
of
his
head
off
with
an
old
musket
that
they
had
for
scarin

the
clegs
and
the
dowps
to
him
thats
the
way
he
fell
off
the
rocks
and
as
to
hopes
of
a
glorious
resurrection
ive
often
heard
him
say
masel
that
he
hoped
hed
go
to
hell
for
his
mother
was
so
pious
that

on
his
hump
and
asks
it
to
be
took
as
evidence
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
lucy
turned
the
conversation
as
she
said
rising
up
oh
why
did
you
tell
us
of
this
it
is
my
favourite
seat
and
i
cannot
leave
it
and
now
i
find
i
must
go
on
sitting
over
the
grave
of
a
suicide
that
wont
harm
ye
my
pretty
an
it
may
make
poor
geordie
gladsome

have
so
trim
a
lass
sittin
on
his
lap
that
wont
hurt
ye
why
ive
sat
here
off
an
on
for
nigh
twenty
years
past
an
it
hasnt
done
me
no
harm
dont
ye
fash
about
them
as
lies
under
ye
or
that
doesn
lie
there
either
itll
be
time
for
ye
to
be
getting
scart
when
ye
see
the
tombsteans
all
run
away
with
and
the
place
as
bare
as
a
stubblefield
theres
the
clock
an
i
must
gang
my
service
to
ye
ladies
and
off
he
hobbled
lucy
and
i
sat
awhile
and
it
was
all
so
beautiful
before
us
that
we
took
hands
as
we
sat
and
she
told
me
all
over
again
about
arthur
and
their
coming
marriage
that
made
me
just
a
little
heartsick
for
i
havent
heard
from
jonathan
for
a
whole
month





the
same
day
i
came
up
here
alone
for
i
am
very
sad
there
was
no
letter
for
me
i
hope
there
cannot
be
anything
the
matter
with
jonathan
the
clock
has
just
struck
nine
i
see
the
lights
scattered
all
over
the
town
sometimes
in
rows
where
the
streets
are
and
sometimes
singly
they
run
right
up
the
esk
and
die
away
in
the
curve
of
the
valley
to
my
left
the
view
is
cut
off
by
a
black
line
of
roof
of
the
old
house
next
the
abbey
the
sheep
and
lambs
are
bleating
in
the
fields
away
behind
me
and
there
is
a
clatter
of
a
donkeys
hoofs
up
the
paved
road
below
the
band
on
the
pier
is
playing
a
harsh
waltz
in
good
time
and
further
along
the
quay
there
is
a
salvation
army
meeting
in
a
back
street
neither
of
the
bands
hears
the
other
but
up
here
i
hear
and
see
them
both
i
wonder
where
jonathan
is
and
if
he
is
thinking
of
me
i
wish
he
were
here

diary
5
junethe
case
of
renfield
grows
more
interesting
the
more
i
get
to
understand
the
man
he
has
certain
qualities
very
largely
developed
selfishness
secrecy
and
purpose
i
wish
i
could
get
at
what
is
the
object
of
the
latter
he
seems
to
have
some
settled
scheme
of
his
own
but
what
it
is
i
do
not
yet
know
his
redeeming
quality
is
a
love
of
animals
though
indeed
he
has
such
curious
turns
in
it
that
i
sometimes
imagine
he
is
only
abnormally
cruel
his
pets
are
of
odd
sorts
just
now
his
hobby
is
catching
flies
he
has
at
present
such
a
quantity
that
i
have
had
myself
to
expostulate
to
my
astonishment
he
did
not
break
out
into
a
fury
as
i
expected
but
took
the
matter
in
simple
seriousness
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
may
i
have
three
days
i
shall
clear
them
away
of
course
i
said
that
would
do
i
must
watch
him





18
junehe
has
turned
his
mind
now
to
spiders
and
has
got
several
very
big
fellows
in
a
box
he
keeps
feeding
them
with
his
flies
and
the
number
of
the
latter
is
becoming
sensibly
diminished
although
he
has
used
half
his
food
in
attracting
more
flies
from
outside
to
his
room





1
julyhis
spiders
are
now
becoming
as
great
a
nuisance
as
his
flies
and
today
i
told
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
them
he
looked
very
sad
at
this
so
i
said
that
he
must
clear
out
some
of
them
at
all
events
he
cheerfully
acquiesced
in
this
and
i
gave
him
the
same
time
as
before
for
reduction
he
disgusted
me
much
while
with
him
for
when
a
horrid
blowfly
bloated
with
some
carrion
food
buzzed
into
the
room
he
caught
it
held
it
exultantly
for
a
few
moments
between
his
finger
and
thumb
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
ate
it
i
scolded
him
for
it
but
he
argued
quietly
that
it
was
very
good
and
very
wholesome
that
it
was
life
strong
life
and
gave
life
to
him
this
gave
me
an
idea
or
the
rudiment
of
one
i
must
watch
how
he
gets
rid
of
his
spiders
he
has
evidently
some
deep
problem
in
his
mind
for
he
keeps
a
little
notebook
in
which
he
is
always
jotting
down
something
whole
pages
of
it
are
filled
with
masses
of
figures
generally
single
numbers
added
up
in
batches
and
then
the
totals
added
in
batches
again
as
though
he
were
focussing
some
account
as
the
auditors
put
it





8
julythere
is
a
method
in
his
madness
and
the
rudimentary
idea
in
my
mind
is
growing
it
will
be
a
whole
idea
soon
and
then
oh
unconscious
cerebration
you
will
have
to
give
the
wall
to
your
conscious
brother
i
kept
away
from
my
friend
for
a
few
days
so
that
i
might
notice
if
there
were
any
change
things
remain
as
they
were
except
that
he
has
parted
with
some
of
his
pets
and
got
a
new
one
he
has
managed
to
get
a
sparrow
and
has
already
partially
tamed
it
his
means
of
taming
is
simple
for
already
the
spiders
have
diminished
those
that
do
remain
however
are
well
fed
for
he
still
brings
in
the
flies
by
tempting
them
with
his
food





19
julywe
are
progressing
my
friend
has
now
a
whole
colony
of
sparrows
and
his
flies
and
spiders
are
almost
obliterated
when
i
came
in
he
ran
to
me
and
said
he
wanted
to
ask
me
a
great
favoura
very
very
great
favour
and
as
he
spoke
he
fawned
on
me
like
a
dog
i
asked
him
what
it
was
and
he
said
with
a
sort
of
rapture
in
his
voice
and
bearing
a
kitten
a
nice
little
sleek
playful
kitten
that
i
can
play
with
and
teach
and
feedand
feedand
feed
i
was
not
unprepared
for
this
request
for
i
had
noticed
how
his
pets
went
on
increasing
in
size
and
vivacity
but
i
did
not
care
that
his
pretty
family
of
tame
sparrows
should
be
wiped
out
in
the
same
manner
as
the
flies
and
the
spiders
so
i
said
i
would
see
about
it
and
asked
him
if
he
would
not
rather
have
a
cat
than
a
kitten
his
eagerness
betrayed
him
as
he
answered
oh
yes
i
would
like
a
cat
i
only
asked
for
a
kitten
lest
you
should
refuse
me
a
cat
no
one
would
refuse
me
a
kitten
would
they
i
shook
my
head
and
said
that
at
present
i
feared
it
would
not
be
possible
but
that
i
would
see
about
it
his
face
fell
and
i
could
see
a
warning
of
danger
in
it
for
there
was
a
sudden
fierce
sidelong
look
which
meant
killing
the
man
is
an
undeveloped
homicidal
maniac
i
shall
test
him
with
his
present
craving
and
see
how
it
will
work
out
then
i
shall
know
more





10
p
mi
have
visited
him
again
and
found
him
sitting
in
a
corner
brooding
when
i
came
in
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
me
and
implored
me
to
let
him
have
a
cat
that
his
salvation
depended
upon
it
i
was
firm
however
and
told
him
that
he
could
not
have
it
whereupon
he
went
without
a
word
and
sat
down
gnawing
his
fingers
in
the
corner
where
i
had
found
him
i
shall
see
him
in
the
morning
early





20
julyvisited
renfield
very
early
before
the
attendant
went
his
rounds
found
him
up
and
humming
a
tune
he
was
spreading
out
his
sugar
which
he
had
saved
in
the
window
and
was
manifestly
beginning
his
flycatching
again
and
beginning
it
cheerfully
and
with
a
good
grace
i
looked
around
for
his
birds
and
not
seeing
them
asked
him
where
they
were
he
replied
without
turning
round
that
they
had
all
flown
away
there
were
a
few
feathers
about
the
room
and
on
his
pillow
a
drop
of
blood
i
said
nothing
but
went
and
told
the
keeper
to
report
to
me
if
there
were
anything
odd
about
him
during
the
day

a
mthe
attendant
has
just
been
to
me
to
say
that
renfield
has
been
very
sick
and
has
disgorged
a
whole
lot
of
feathers
my
belief
is
doctor
he
said
that
he
has
eaten
his
birds
and
that
he
just
took
and
ate
them
raw





11
p
mi
gave
renfield
a
strong
opiate
tonight
enough
to
make
even
him
sleep
and
took
away
his
pocketbook
to
look
at
it
the
thought
that
has
been
buzzing
about
my
brain
lately
is
complete
and
the
theory
proved
my
homicidal
maniac
is
of
a
peculiar
kind
i
shall
have

invent
a

classification
for
him

call
him
a

lifeeating
maniac
what
he
desires
is
to
absorb
as
many
lives
as
he
can
and
he
has
laid
himself
out
to
achieve
it
in
a
cumulative
way
he
gave
many
flies
to
one
spider
and
many
spiders
to
one
bird
and
then
wanted
a
cat
to
eat
the
many
birds
what
would
have
been
his
later
steps
it
would
almost
be
worth
while
to
complete
the
experiment
it
might
be
done
if
there
were
only
a
sufficient
cause
men
sneered
at
vivisection
and
yet
look
at
its
results
today
why
not
advance
science
in
its
most
difficult
and
vital
aspectthe
knowledge
of
the

i
even
the
secret
of
one
such
minddid
i
hold
the
key
to
the
fancy
of
even
one
lunatici
might
advance
my
own
branch
of
science
to
a
pitch
compared
with
which
burdonsandersons

or
ferriers
brainknowledge
would
be
as
nothing
if
only
there
were
a

i
must
not
think
too
much
of
this
or
i
may
be
tempted
a
good
cause
might
turn
the
scale
with
me
for
may
not
i
too
be
of
an
exceptional
brain
congenitally
how
well
the
man
reasoned
lunatics
always
do
within
their
own
scope
i
wonder
at
how
many
lives
he
values
a
man
or
if
at
only
one
he
has
closed
the
account
most
accurately
and
today
begun
a
new
record
how
many
of
us
begin
a
new
record
with
each
day
of
our
lives
to
me
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
my
whole
life
ended
with
my
new
hope
and
that
truly
i
began
a
new
record
so
it
will
be
until
the
great
recorder
sums
me
up
and
closes
my
ledger
account
with
a
balance
to
profit
or
loss

can
i
be

julyi
am
anxious
and
it
soothes
me
to
express
myself
here
it
is
like
whispering
to
ones
self
and
listening
at
the
same
time
and
there
is
also
something
about
the
shorthand
symbols
that
makes
it
different
from
writing
i
am
unhappy
about
lucy
and
about
jonathan
i
had
not
heard
from
jonathan
for
some
time
and
was
very
concerned
but
yesterday
dear
mr
hawkins
who
is
always
so
kind
sent
me
a
letter
from
him
i
had
written
asking
him
if
he
had
heard
and
he
said
the
enclosed
had
just
been
received
it
is
only
a
line
dated
from
castle
dracula
and
says
that
he
is
just
starting
for
home
that
is
not
like
jonathan
i
do
not
understand
it
and
it
makes
me
uneasy
then
too
lucy
although
she
is
so
well
has
lately
taken
to
her
old
habit
of
walking
in
her
sleep
her
mother
has
spoken
to
me
about
it
and
we
have
decided
that
i
am
to
lock
the
door
of
our
room
every
night
mrs
westenra
has
got
an
idea
that
sleepwalkers
always
go
out
on
roofs
of
houses
and
along
the
edges
of
cliffs
and
then
get
suddenly
wakened
and
fall
over
with
a
despairing
cry
that
echoes
all
over
the
place
poor
dear
she
is
naturally
anxious
about
lucy
and
she
tells
me
that
her
husband
lucys
father
had
the
same
habit
that
he
would
get
up
in
the
night
and
dress
himself
and
go
out
if
he
were
not
stopped
lucy
is
to
be
married
in
the
autumn
and
she
is
already
planning
out
her
dresses
and
how
her
house
is
to
be
arranged
i
sympathise
with
her
for
i
do
the
same
only
jonathan
and
i
will
start
in
life
in
a
very
simple
way
and
shall
have
to
try
to
make
both
ends
meet
mr
holmwoodhe
is
the
hon
arthur
holmwood
only
son
of
lord
godalmingis
coming
up
here
very
shortlyas
soon
as
he
can
leave
town
for
his
father
is
not
very
well
and
i
think
dear
lucy
is
counting
the
moments
till
he
comes
she
wants
to
take
him
up
to
the
seat
on
the
churchyard
cliff
and
show
him
the
beauty
of
whitby
i
daresay
it
is
the
waiting
which
disturbs
her
she
will
be
all
right
when
he
arrives





27
julyno
news
from
jonathan
i
am
getting
quite
uneasy
about
him
though
why
i
should
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
wish
that
he
would
write
if
it
were
only
a
single
line
lucy
walks
more
than
ever
and
each
night
i
am
awakened
by
her
moving
about
the
room
fortunately
the
weather
is
so
hot
that
she
cannot
get
cold
but
still
the
anxiety
and
the
perpetually
being
wakened
is
beginning
to
tell
on
me
and
i
am
getting
nervous
and
wakeful
myself
thank
god
lucys
health
keeps
up
mr
holmwood
has
been
suddenly
called
to
ring
to
see
his
father
who
has
been
taken
seriously
ill
lucy
frets
at
the
postponement
of
seeing
him
but
it
does
not
touch
her
looks
she
is
a
trifle
stouter
and
her
cheeks
are
a
lovely
rosepink
she
has
lost
that
anmic
look
which
she
had
i
pray
it
will
all
last





3
augustanother
week
gone
and
no
news
from
jonathan
not
even
to
mr
hawkins
from
whom
i
have
heard
oh
i
do
hope
he
is
not
ill
he
surely
would
have
written
i
look
at
that
last
letter
of
his
but
somehow
it
does
not
satisfy
me
it
does
not
read
like
him
and
yet
it
is
his
writing
there
is
no
mistake
of
that
lucy
has
not
walked
much
in
her
sleep
the
last
week
but
there
is
an
odd
concentration
about
her
which
i
do
not
understand
even
in
her
sleep
she
seems
to
be
watching
me
she
tries
the
door
and
finding
it
locked
goes
about
the
room
searching
for
the
key
6
augustanother
three
days
and
no
news
this
suspense
is
getting
dreadful
if
i
only
knew
where
to
write
to
or
where
to
go
to
i
should
feel
easier
but
no
one
has
heard
a
word
of
jonathan
since
that
last
letter
i
must
only
pray
to
god
for
patience
lucy
is
more
excitable
than
ever
but
is
otherwise
well
last
night
was
very
threatening
and
the
fishermen
say
that
we
are
in
for
a
storm
i
must
try
to
watch
it
and
learn
the
weather
signs
today
is
a
grey
day
and
the
sun
as
i
write
is
hidden
in
thick
clouds
high
over
kettleness
everything
is
greyexcept
the
green
grass
which
seems
like
emerald
amongst
it
grey
earthy
rock
grey
clouds
tinged
with
the
sunburst
at
the
far
edge
hang
over
the
grey
sea
into
which
the
sandpoints
stretch
like
grey
fingers
the
sea
is
tumbling
in
over
the
shallows
and
the
sandy
flats
with
a
roar
muffled
in
the
seamists
drifting
inland
the
horizon
is
lost
in
a
grey
mist
all
is
vastness
the
clouds
are
piled
up
like
giant
rocks
and
there
is
a
brool
over
the
sea
that
sounds
like
some
presage
of
doom
dark
figures
are
on
the
beach
here
and
there
sometimes
half
shrouded
in
the
mist
and
seem
men
like
trees
walking
the
fishingboats
are
racing
for
home
and
rise
and
dip
in
the
ground
swell
as
they
sweep
into
the
harbour
bending
to
the
scuppers
here
comes
old
mr
swales
he
is
making
straight
for
me
and
i
can
see
by
the
way
he
lifts
his
hat
that
he
wants
to
talk
i
have
been
quite
touched
by
the
change
in
the
poor
old
man
when
he
sat
down
beside
me
he
said
in
a
very
gentle
way
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
miss
i
could
see
he
was
not
at
ease
so
i
took
his
poor
old
wrinkled
hand
in
mine
and
asked
him
to
speak
fully
so
he
said
leaving
his
hand
in
mine
im
afraid
my
deary
that
i
must
have
shocked
you
by
all
the
wicked
things
ive
been
sayin
about
the
dead
and
such
like
for
weeks
past
but
i
didnt
mean
them
and
i
want
ye
to
remember
that
when
im
gone
we
aud
folks
that
be
daffled
and
with
one
foot
abaft
the
krokhooal
dont
altogether
like
to
think
of
it
and
we
dont
want
to
feel
scart
of
it
an
thats
why
ive
took
to
makin
light
of
it
so
that
id
cheer
up
my
own
heart
a
bit
but
lord

bit

die
if
i
can
help
it

be
nigh
at
hand
now
for
i
be
aud

too
much

aud
man
is
already
whettin

once
the
chafts
will
wag
as
they
be
used
to
some
day
soon
the
angel
of
death
will
sound
his
trumpet
for
me
but
dont

and
sore
distress
and
sad
hearts
look

he
cried
suddenly
theres
something
in
that
wind
and
in
the
hoast
beyont
that
sounds
and
looks
and
tastes
and
smells
like
death
its
in
the
air
i
feel
it
comin
lord
make
me
answer
cheerful
when
my
call
comes
he
held
up
his
arms
devoutly
and
raised
his
hat
his
mouth
moved
as
though
he
were
praying
after
a
few
minutes
silence
he
got
up
shook
hands
with
me
and
blessed
me
and
said
goodbye
and
hobbled
off
it
all
touched
me
and
upset
me
very
much
i
was
glad
when
the
coastguard
came
along
with
his
spyglass
under
his
arm
he
stopped
to
talk
with
me
as
he
always
does
but
all
the
time
kept
looking
at
a
strange
ship
i
cant
make
her
out
he
said
shes
a
russian
by
the
look
of
her
but
shes
knocking
about
in
the
queerest
way
she
doesnt
know
her
mind
a
bit
she
seems
to
see
the
storm
coming
but
cant
decide
whether
to
run
up
north
in
the
open
or
to
put
in
here
look
there
again
she
is
steered
mighty
strangely
for
she
doesnt
mind
the
hand
on
the
wheel
changes
about
with
every
puff
of
wind
well
hear
more
of
her
before

correspondent
whitby
one
of
the
greatest
and
suddenest
storms
on
record
has
just
been
experienced
here
with
results
both
strange
and
unique
the
weather
had
been
somewhat
sultry
but
not
to
any
degree
uncommon
in
the
month
of
august
saturday
evening
was
as
fine
as
was
ever
known
and
the
great
body
of
holidaymakers
laid
out
yesterday
for
visits
to
mulgrave
woods
robin
hoods
bay
rig
mill
runswick
staithes
and
the
various
trips
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitby
the
steamers
emma
and
scarborough
made
trips
up
and
down
the
coast
and
there
was
an
unusual
amount
of
tripping
both
to
and
from
whitby
the
day
was
unusually
fine
till
the
afternoon
when
some
of
the
gossips
who
frequent
the
east
cliff
churchyard
and
from
that
commanding
eminence
watch
the
wide
sweep
of
sea
visible
to
the
north
and
east
called
attention
to
a
sudden
show
of
marestails
high
in
the
sky
to
the
northwest
the
wind
was
then
blowing

the
mild
degree

in

light

the
coastguard
on
duty
at
once
made
report
and
one
old
fisherman
who
for
more
than
half
a
century
has
kept
watch
on
weather
signs
from
the
east
cliff
foretold
in
an
emphatic
manner
the
coming
of
a
sudden
storm
the
approach
of
sunset
was
so
very
beautiful
so
grand
in
its
masses
of
splendidlycoloured
clouds
that
there
was
quite
an
assemblage
on
the
walk
along
the
cliff
in
the
old
churchyard
to
enjoy
the
beauty
before
the
sun
dipped
below
the
black
mass
of
kettleness
standing
boldly
athwart
the
western
sky
its
downward
way
was
marked
by
myriad
clouds
of

and
all
the
tints

there
masses
not
large
but
of
seemingly
absolute
blackness
in
all
sorts
of
shapes
as
well
outlined
as
colossal
silhouettes
the
experience
was
not
lost
on
the
painters
and
doubtless
some
of
the
sketches
of
the
prelude
to
the
great
storm
will
grace

next
more
than
one
captain
made
up
his
mind
then
and
there
that
his
cobble
or
his
mule
as
they
term
the
different
classes
of
boats
would
remain
in
the
harbour
till
the
storm
had
passed
the
wind
fell
away
entirely
during
the
evening
and
at
midnight
there
was
a
dead
calm
a
sultry
heat
and
that
prevailing
intensity
which
on
the
approach
of
thunder
affects
persons
of
a
sensitive
nature
there
were
but
few
lights
in
sight
at
sea
for
even
the
coasting
steamers
which
usually
hug
the
shore
so
closely
kept
well
to
seaward
and
but
few
fishingboats
were
in
sight
the
only
sail
noticeable
was
a
foreign
schooner
with
all
sails
set
which
was
seemingly
going
westwards
the
foolhardiness
or
ignorance
of
her
officers
was
a
prolific
theme
for
comment
whilst
she
remained
in
sight
and
efforts
were
made
to
signal
her
to
reduce
sail
in
face
of
her
danger
before
the
night
shut
down
she
was
seen
with
sails
idly
flapping
as
she
gently
rolled
on
the
undulating
swell
of
the
sea
as
idle
as
a
painted
ship
upon
a
painted
ocean
shortly
before
ten
oclock
the
stillness
of
the
air
grew
quite
oppressive
and
the
silence
was
so
marked
that
the
bleating
of
a
sheep
inland
or
the
barking
of
a
dog
in
the
town
was
distinctly
heard
and
the
band
on
the
pier
with
its
lively
french
air
was
like
a
discord
in
the
great
harmony
of
natures
silence
a
little
after
midnight
came
a
strange
sound
from
over
the
sea
and
high
overhead
the
air
began
to
carry
a
strange
faint
hollow
booming
then
without
warning
the
tempest
broke
with
a
rapidity
which
at
the
time
seemed
incredible
and
even
afterwards
is
impossible
to
realize
the
whole
aspect
of
nature
at
once
became
convulsed
the
waves
rose
in
growing
fury
each
overtopping
its
fellow
till
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
lately
glassy
sea
was
like
a
roaring
and
devouring
monster
whitecrested
waves
beat
madly
on
the
level
sands
and
rushed
up
the
shelving
cliffs
others
broke
over
the
piers
and
with
their
spume
swept
the
lanthorns
of
the
lighthouses
which
rise
from
the
end
of
either
pier
of
whitby
harbour
the
wind
roared
like
thunder
and
blew
with
such
force
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
even
strong
men
kept
their
feet
or
clung
with
grim
clasp
to
the
iron
stanchions
it
was
found
necessary
to
clear
the
entire
piers
from
the
mass
of
onlookers
or
else
the
fatalities
of
the
night
would
have
been
increased
manifold
to
add
to
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
time
masses
of
seafog
came
drifting
inlandwhite
wet
clouds
which
swept
by
in
ghostly
fashion
so
dank
and
damp
and
cold
that
it
needed
but
little
effort
of
imagination
to
think
that
the
spirits
of
those
lost
at
sea
were
touching
their
living
brethren
with
the
clammy
hands
of
death
and
many
a
one
shuddered
as
the
wreaths
of
seamist
swept
by
at
times
the
mist
cleared
and
the
sea
for
some
distance
could
be
seen
in
the
glare
of
the
lightning
which
now
came
thick
and
fast
followed
by
such
sudden
peals
of
thunder
that
the
whole
sky
overhead
seemed
trembling
under
the
shock
of
the
footsteps
of
the
storm
some
of
the
scenes
thus
revealed
were
of
immeasurable
grandeur
and
of
absorbing
interestthe
sea
running
mountains
high
threw
skywards
with
each
wave
mighty
masses
of
white
foam
which
the
tempest
seemed
to
snatch
at
and
whirl
away
into
space
here
and
there
a
fishingboat
with
a
rag
of
sail
running
madly
for
shelter
before
the
blast
now
and
again
the
white
wings
of
a
stormtossed
seabird
on
the
summit
of
the
east
cliff
the
new
searchlight
was
ready
for
experiment
but
had
not
yet
been
tried
the
officers
in
charge
of
it
got
it
into
working
order
and
in
the
pauses
of
the
inrushing
mist
swept
with
it
the
surface
of
the
sea
once
or
twice
its
service
was
most
effective
as
when
a
fishingboat
with
gunwale
under
water
rushed
into
the
harbour
able
by
the
guidance
of
the
sheltering
light
to
avoid
the
danger
of
dashing
against
the
piers
as
each
boat
achieved
the
safety
of
the
port
there
was
a
shout
of
joy
from
the
mass
of
people
on
shore
a
shout
which
for
a
moment
seemed
to
cleave
the
gale
and
was
then
swept
away
in
its
rush
before
long
the
searchlight
discovered
some
distance
away
a
schooner
with
all
sails
set
apparently
the
same
vessel
which
had
been
noticed
earlier
in
the
evening
the
wind
had
by
this
time
backed
to
the
east
and
there
was
a
shudder
amongst
the
watchers
on
the
cliff
as
they
realized
the
terrible
danger
in
which
she
now
was
between
her
and
the
port
lay
the
great
flat
reef
on
which
so
many
good
ships
have
from
time
to
time
suffered
and
with
the
wind
blowing
from
its
present
quarter
it
would
be
quite
impossible
that
she
should
fetch
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
it
was
now
nearly
the
hour
of
high
tide
but
the
waves
were
so
great
that
in
their
troughs
the
shallows
of
the
shore
were
almost
visible
and
the
schooner
with
all
sails
set
was
rushing
with
such
speed
that
in
the
words
of
one
old
salt
she
must
fetch
up
somewhere
if
it
was
only
in
hell
then
came
another
rush
of
seafog
greater
than
any
hithertoa
mass
of
dank
mist
which
seemed
to
close
on
all
things
like
a
grey
pall
and
left
available
to
men
only
the
organ
of
hearing
for
the
roar
of
the
tempest
and
the
crash
of
the
thunder
and
the
booming
of
the
mighty
billows
came
through
the
damp
oblivion
even
louder
than
before
the
rays
of
the
searchlight
were
kept
fixed
on
the
harbour
mouth
across
the
east
pier
where
the
shock
was
expected
and
men
waited
breathless
the
wind
suddenly
shifted
to
the
northeast
and
the
remnant
of
the
seafog
melted
in
the
blast
and
then
mirabile
dictu
between
the
piers
leaping
from
wave
to
wave
as
it
rushed
at
headlong
speed
swept
the
strange
schooner
before
the
blast
with
all
sail
set
and
gained
the
safety
of
the
harbour
the
searchlight
followed
her
and
a
shudder
ran
through
all
who
saw
her
for
lashed
to
the
helm
was
a
corpse
with
drooping
head
which
swung
horribly
to
and
fro
at
each
motion
of
the
ship
no
other
form
could
be
seen
on
deck
at
all
a
great
awe
came
on
all
as
they
realised
that
the
ship
as
if
by
a
miracle
had
found
the
harbour
unsteered
save
by
the
hand
of
a
dead
man
however
all
took
place
more
quickly
than
it
takes
to
write
these
words
the
schooner
paused
not
but
rushing
across
the
harbour
pitched
herself
on
that
accumulation
of
sand
and
gravel
washed
by
many
tides
and
many
storms
into
the
southeast
corner
of
the
pier
jutting
under
the
east
cliff
known
locally
as
tate
hill
pier
there
was
of
course
a
considerable
concussion
as
the
vessel
drove
up
on
the
sand
heap
every
spar
rope
and
stay
was
strained
and
some
of
the
tophammer
came
crashing
down
but
strangest
of
all
the
very
instant
the
shore
was
touched
an
immense
dog
sprang
up
on
deck
from
below
as
if
shot
up
by
the
concussion
and
running
forward
jumped
from
the
bow
on
the
sand
making
straight
for
the
steep
cliff
where
the
churchyard
hangs
over
the
laneway
to
the
east
pier
so
steeply
that
some
of
the
flat
tombstonesthruffsteans
or
throughstones
as
they
call
them
in
the
whitby
vernacularactually
project
over
where
the
sustaining
cliff
has
fallen
away
it
disappeared
in
the
darkness
which
seemed
intensified
just
beyond
the
focus
of
the
searchlight
it
so
happened
that
there
was
no
one
at
the
moment
on
tate
hill
pier
as
all
those
whose
houses
are
in
close
proximity
were
either
in
bed
or
were
out
on
the
heights
above
thus
the
coastguard
on
duty
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
harbour
who
at
once
ran
down
to
the
little
pier
was
the
first
to
climb
on
board
the
men
working
the
searchlight
after
scouring
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
without
seeing
anything
then
turned
the
light
on
the
derelict
and
kept
it
there
the
coastguard
ran
aft
and
when
he
came
beside
the
wheel
bent
over
to
examine
it
and
recoiled
at
once
as
though
under
some
sudden
emotion
this
seemed
to
pique
general
curiosity
and
quite
a
number
of
people
began
to
run
it
is
a
good
way
round
from
the
west
cliff
by
the
drawbridge
to
tate
hill
pier
but
your
correspondent
is
a
fairly
good
runner
and
came
well
ahead
of
the
crowd
when
i
arrived
however
i
found
already
assembled
on
the
pier
a
crowd
whom
the
coastguard
and
police
refused
to
allow
to
come
on
board
by
the
courtesy
of
the
chief
boatman
i
was
as
your
correspondent
permitted
to
climb
on
deck
and
was
one
of
a
small
group
who
saw
the
dead
seaman
whilst
actually
lashed
to
the
wheel
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
coastguard
was
surprised
or
even
awed
for
not
often
can
such
a
sight
have
been
seen
the
man
was
simply
fastened
by
his
hands
tied
one
over
the
other
to
a
spoke
of
the
wheel
between
the
inner
hand
and
the
wood
was
a
crucifix
the
set
of
beads
on
which
it
was
fastened
being
around
both
wrists
and
wheel
and
all
kept
fast
by
the
binding
cords
the
poor
fellow
may
have
been
seated
at
one
time
but
the
flapping
and
buffeting
of
the
sails
had
worked
through
the
rudder
of
the
wheel
and
dragged
him
to
and
fro
so
that
the
cords
with
which
he
was
tied
had
cut
the
flesh
to
the
bone
accurate
note
was
made
of
the
state
of
things
and
a
doctorsurgeon
j
m
caffyn
of
33
east
elliot
placewho
came
immediately
after
me
declared
after
making
examination
that
the
man
must
have
been
dead
for
quite
two
days
in
his
pocket
was
a
bottle
carefully
corked
empty
save
for
a
little
roll
of
paper
which
proved
to
be
the
addendum
to
the
log
the
coastguard
said
the
man
must
have
tied
up
his
own
hands
fastening
the
knots
with
his
teeth
the
fact
that
a
coastguard
was
the
first
on
board
may
save
some
complications
later
on
in
the
admiralty
court
for
coastguards
cannot
claim
the
salvage
which
is
the
right
of
the
first
civilian
entering
on
a
derelict
already
however
the
legal
tongues
are
wagging
and
one
young
law
student
is
loudly
asserting
that
the
rights
of
the
owner
are
already
completely
sacrificed
his
property
being
held
in
contravention
of
the
statutes
of
mortmain
since
the
tiller
as
emblemship
if
not
proof
of
delegated
possession
is
held
in
a
dead
hand
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the

in

for

further
details

found
her
way
so
miraculously
into
harbour
in

whitby
9
augustthe
sequel
to
the
strange
arrival
of
the
derelict
in
the
storm
last
night
is
almost
more
startling
than
the
thing
itself
it
turns
out
that
the
schooner
is
a
russian
from
varna
and
is
called
the
demeter
she
is
almost
entirely
in
ballast
of
silver
sand
with
only
a
small
amount
of
cargoa
number
of
great
wooden
boxes
filled
with
mould
this
cargo
was
consigned
to
a
whitby
solicitor
mr
s
f
billington
of
7
the
crescent
who
this
morning
went
aboard
and
formally
took
possession
of
the
goods
consigned
to
him
the
russian
consul
too
acting
for
the
charterparty
took
formal
possession
of
the
ship
and
paid
all
harbour
dues
etc
nothing
is
talked
about
here
today
except
the
strange
coincidence
the
officials
of
the
board
of
trade
have
been
most
exacting
in
seeing
that
every
compliance
has
been
made
with
existing
regulations
as
the
matter
is
to
be
a
nine
days
wonder
they
are
evidently
determined
that
there
shall
be
no
cause
of
after
complaint
a
good
deal
of
interest
was
abroad
concerning
the
dog
which
landed
when
the
ship
struck
and
more
than
a
few
of
the
members
of
the
s
p
c
a
which
is
very
strong
in
whitby
have
tried
to
befriend
the
animal
to
the
general
disappointment
however
it
was
not
to
be
found
it
seems
to
have
disappeared
entirely
from
the
town
it
may
be
that
it
was
frightened
and
made
its
way
on
to
the
moors
where
it
is
still
hiding
in
terror
there
are
some
who
look
with
dread
on
such
a
possibility
lest
later
on
it
should
in
itself
become
a
danger
for
it
is
evidently
a
fierce
brute
early
this
morning
a
large
dog
a
halfbred
mastiff
belonging
to
a
coal
merchant
close
to
tate
hill
pier
was
found
dead
in
the
roadway
opposite
to
its
masters
yard
it
had
been
fighting
and
manifestly
had
had
a
savage
opponent
for
its
throat
was
torn
away
and
its
belly
was
slit
open
as
if
with
a
savage
claw





laterby
the
kindness
of
the
board
of
trade
inspector
i
have
been
permitted
to
look
over
the
logbook
of
the
demeter
which
was
in
order
up
to
within
three
days
but
contained
nothing
of
special
interest
except
as
to
facts
of
missing
men
the
greatest
interest
however
is
with
regard
to
the
paper
found
in
the
bottle
which
was
today
produced
at
the
inquest
and
a
more
strange
narrative
than
the
two
between
them
unfold
it
has
not
been
my
lot
to
come
across
as
there
is
no
motive
for
concealment
i
am
permitted
to
use
them
and
accordingly
send
you
a
rescript
simply
omitting
technical
details
of
seamanship
and
supercargo
it
almost
seems
as
though
the
captain
had
been
seized
with
some
kind
of
mania
before
he
had
got
well
into
blue
water
and
that
this
had
developed
persistently
throughout
the
voyage

getting
very
impatient
with

feared

on
17
july
yesterday
one
of
the
men
olgaren
came
to
my
cabin
and
in
an
awestruck
way
confided
to
me
that
he
thought
there
was
a
strange
man
aboard
the
ship
he
said
that
in
his
watch
he
had
been
sheltering
behind
the
deckhouse
as
there
was
a
rainstorm
when
he
saw
a
tall
thin
man
who
was
not
like
any
of
the
crew
come
up
the
companionway
and
go
along
the
deck
forward
and
disappear
he
followed
cautiously
but
when
he
got
to
bows
found
no
one
and
the
hatchways
were
all
closed
he
was
in
a
panic
of
superstitious
fear
and
i
am
afraid
the
panic
may
spread
to
allay
it
i
shall
today
search
entire
ship
carefully
from
stem
to
stern





later
in
the
day
i
got
together
the
whole
crew
and
told
them
as
they
evidently
thought
there
was
some
one
in
the
ship
we
would
search
from
stem
to
stern
first
mate
angry
said
it
was
folly
and
to
yield
to
such
foolish
ideas
would
demoralise
the
men
said
he
would
engage
to
keep
them
out
of
trouble
with
a
handspike
i
let
him
take
the
helm
while
the
rest
began
thorough
search
all
keeping
abreast
with
lanterns
we
left
no
corner
unsearched
as
there
were
only
the
big
wooden
boxes
there
were
no
odd
corners
where
a
man
could
hide
men
much
relieved
when
search
over
and
went
back
to
work

scowled

midnightwoke
up
from
few
minutes
sleep
by
hearing
a
cry
seemingly
outside
my
port
could
see
nothing
in
fog
rushed
on
deck
and
ran
against
mate
tells
me
heard
cry
and
ran
but
no
sign
of

lord
help
us
mate
says
we
must
be
past
straits
of
dover
as
in
a
moment
of
fog
lifting
he
saw
north
foreland
just
as
he
heard
the
man
cry
out
if
so
we
are
now
off
in
the
north
sea
and
only
god
can
guide
us
in
the
fog
which
seems
to
move
with
us
and
god
seems
to
have
deserted
us





3
augustat
midnight
i
went
to
relieve
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
when
i
got
to
it
found
no
one
there
the
wind
was
steady
and
as
we
ran
before
it
there
was
no
yawing
i
dared
not
leave
it
so
shouted
for
the
mate
after
a
few
seconds
he
rushed
up
on
deck
in
his
flannels
he
looked
wildeyed
and
haggard
and
i
greatly
fear
his
reason
has
given
way
he
came
close
to
me
and
whispered
hoarsely
with
his
mouth
to
my
ear
as
though
fearing
the
very
air
might
hear
it
is
here
i
know
it
now
on
the
watch
last
night
i
saw
it
like
a
man
tall
and
thin
and
ghastly
pale
it
was
in
the
bows
and
looking
out
i
crept
behind
it
and
gave
it
my
knife
but
the
knife
went
through
it
empty
as
the
air
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
his
knife
and
drove
it
savagely
into
space
then
he
went
on
but
it
is
here
and
ill
find
it
it
is
in
the
hold
perhaps
in
one
of
those
boxes
ill
unscrew
them
one
by
one
and
see
you
work
the
helm
and
with
a
warning
look
and
his
finger
on
his
lip
he
went
below
there
was
springing
up
a
choppy
wind
and
i
could
not
leave
the
helm
i
saw
him
come
out
on
deck
again
with
a
toolchest
and
a
lantern
and
go
down
the
forward
hatchway
he
is
mad
stark
raving
mad
and
its
no
use
my
trying
to
stop
him
he
cant
hurt
those
big
boxes
they
are
invoiced
as
clay
and
to
pull
them
about
is
as
harmless
a
thing
as
he
can
do
so
here
i
stay
and
mind
the
helm
and
write
these
notes
i
can
only
trust
in
god
and
wait
till
the
fog
clears
then
if
i
cant
steer
to
any
harbour
with
the
wind
that
is
i
shall
cut
down
sails
and
lie
by
and
signal
for
help





it
is
nearly
all
over
now
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
hope
that
the
mate
would
come
out
calmerfor
i
heard
him
knocking
away
at
something
in
the
hold
and
work
is
good
for
himthere
came
up
the
hatchway
a
sudden
startled
scream
which
made
my
blood
run
cold
and
up
on
the
deck
he
came
as
if
shot
from
a
guna
raging
madman
with
his
eyes
rolling
and
his
face
convulsed
with
fear
save
me
save
me
he
cried
and
then
looked
round
on
the
blanket
of
fog
his
horror
turned
to
despair
and
in
a
steady
voice
he
said
you
had
better
come
too
captain
before
it
is
too
late
he
is
there
i
know
the
secret
now
the
sea
will
save
me
from
him
and
it
is
all
that
is
left
before
i
could
say
a
word
or
move
forward
to
seize
him
he
sprang
on
the
bulwark
and
deliberately
threw
himself
into
the
sea
i
suppose
i
know
the
secret
too
now
it
was
this
madman
who
had
got
rid
of
the
men
one
by
one
and
now
he
has
followed
them
himself
god
help
me
how
am
i
to
account
for
all
these
horrors
when
i
get

when
i

i

there
is

because
i
am
a

why
else
i
know
not
i
dared
not
go
below
i
dared
not

the

so
here
all
night
i
stayed
and
in
the
dimness
of
the
night
i
saw
ithim
god
forgive
me
but
the
mate
was
right
to
jump
overboard
it
was
better
to
die
like
a
man
to
die
like
a
sailor
in

water
no
man
can
object
but
i
am
captain
and
i
must
not
leave
my
ship
but
i
shall
baffle
this
fiend

monster
for
i
shall
tie
my
hands
to
the
wheel
when
my
strength
begins
to
fail
and
along
with
them
i
shall
tie
that
which
heitdare
not
touch
and
then
come
good
wind
or
foul
i
shall
save
my
soul
and
my
honour
as
a
captain
i
am
growing
weaker

the
night
is
coming

if
he
can
look
me
in

may
not

this

may
be
found

those
who
find
it
may
understand
if
not

well
then
all

shall
know
that
i
have
been
true

a
poor
ignorant
soul
trying
to
do
his
duty





of
course
the
verdict
was
an
open
one
there
is
no
evidence
to
adduce
and
whether
or
not
the
man
himself
committed
the
murders
there
is
now
none
to
say
the
folk
here
hold
almost
universally
that
the
captain
is
simply
a
hero
and
he
is
to
be
given
a
public
funeral
already
it
is
arranged
that
his
body
is
to
be
taken
with
a
train
of
boats
up
the
esk
for
a
piece
and
then
brought
back
to
tate

up
the

he
is
to
be
buried

the

of
more
than
a
hundred

have
already
given
in
their
names

wishing
to
follow
him
to
the

has
ever

there

with
public
opinion

he
would
i
believe
be
adopted
by
the

tomorrow
will
see
the
funeral
and
so
will
end

augustlucy
was
very
restless
all
night
and
i
too
could
not
sleep
the
storm
was
fearful
and
as
it
boomed
loudly
among
the
chimneypots
it
made
me
shudder
when
a
sharp
puff
came
it
seemed
to
be
like
a
distant
gun
strangely
enough
lucy
did
not
wake
but
she
got
up
twice
and
dressed
herself
fortunately
each
time
i
awoke
in
time
and
managed
to
undress
her
without
waking
her
and
got
her
back
to
bed
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
this
sleepwalking
for
as
soon
as
her
will
is
thwarted
in
any
physical
way
her
intention
if
there
be
any
disappears
and
she
yields
herself
almost
exactly
to
the
routine
of
her
life
early
in
the
morning
we
both
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
harbour
to
see
if
anything
had
happened
in
the
night
there
were
very
few
people
about
and
though
the
sun
was
bright
and
the
air
clear
and
fresh
the
big
grimlooking
waves
that
seemed
dark
themselves
because
the
foam
that
topped
them
was
like
snow
forced
themselves
in
through
the
narrow
mouth
of
the
harbourlike
a
bullying
man
going
through
a
crowd
somehow
i
felt
glad
that
jonathan
was
not
on
the
sea
last
night
but
on
land
but
oh
is
he
on
land
or
sea
where
is
he
and
how
i
am
getting
fearfully
anxious
about
him
if
i
only
knew
what
to
do
and
could
do
anything

augustthe
funeral
of
the
poor
seacaptain
today
was
most
touching
every
boat
in
the
harbour
seemed
to
be
there
and
the
coffin
was
carried
by
captains
all
the
way
from
tate
hill
pier
up
to
the
churchyard
lucy
came
with
me
and
we
went
early
to
our
old
seat
whilst
the
cortge
of
boats
went
up
the
river
to
the
viaduct
and
came
down
again
we
had
a
lovely
view
and
saw
the
procession
nearly
all
the
way
the
poor
fellow
was
laid
to
rest
quite
near
our
seat
so
that
we
stood
on
it
when
the
time
came
and
saw
everything
poor
lucy
seemed
much
upset
she
was
restless
and
uneasy
all
the
time
and
i
cannot
but
think
that
her
dreaming
at
night
is
telling
on
her
she
is
quite
odd
in
one
thing
she
will
not
admit
to
me
that
there
is
any
cause
for
restlessness
or
if
there
be
she
does
not
understand
it
herself
there
is
an
additional
cause
in
that
poor
old
mr
swales
was
found
dead
this
morning
on
our
seat
his
neck
being
broken
he
had
evidently
as
the
doctor
said
fallen
back
in
the
seat
in
some
sort
of
fright
for
there
was
a
look
of
fear
and
horror
on
his
face
that
the
men
said
made
them
shudder
poor
dear
old
man
perhaps
he
had
seen
death
with
his
dying
eyes
lucy
is
so
sweet
and
sensitive
that
she
feels
influences
more
acutely
than
other
people
do
just
now
she
was
quite
upset
by
a
little
thing
which
i
did
not
much
heed
though
i
am
myself
very
fond
of
animals
one
of
the
men
who
came
up
here
often
to
look
for
the
boats
was
followed
by
his
dog
the
dog
is
always
with
him
they
are
both
quiet
persons
and
i
never
saw
the
man
angry
nor
heard
the
dog
bark
during
the
service
the
dog
would
not
come
to
its
master
who
was
on
the
seat
with
us
but
kept
a
few
yards
off
barking
and
howling
its
master
spoke
to
it
gently
and
then
harshly
and
then
angrily
but
it
would
neither
come
nor
cease
to
make
a
noise
it
was
in
a
sort
of
fury
with
its
eyes
savage
and
all
its
hairs
bristling
out
like
a
cats
tail
when
puss
is
on
the
warpath
finally
the
man
too
got
angry
and
jumped
down
and
kicked
the
dog
and
then
took
it
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
half
dragged
and
half
threw
it
on
the
tombstone
on
which
the
seat
is
fixed
the
moment
it
touched
the
stone
the
poor
thing
became
quiet
and
fell
all
into
a
tremble
it
did
not
try
to
get
away
but
crouched
down
quivering
and
cowering
and
was
in
such
a
pitiable
state
of
terror
that
i
tried
though
without
effect
to
comfort
it
lucy
was
full
of
pity
too
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
touch
the
dog
but
looked
at
it
in
an
agonised
sort
of
way
i
greatly
fear
that
she
is
of
too
supersensitive
a
nature
to
go
through
the
world
without
trouble
she
will
be
dreaming
of
this
tonight
i
am
sure
the
whole
agglomeration
of
thingsthe
ship
steered
into
port
by
a
dead
man
his
attitude
tied
to
the
wheel
with
a
crucifix
and
beads
the
touching
funeral
the
dog
now
furious
and
now
in
terrorwill
all
afford
material
for
her
dreams
i
think
it
will
be
best
for
her
to
go
to
bed
tired
out
physically
so
i
shall
take
her
for
a
long
walk
by
the
cliffs
to
robin
hoods
bay
and
back
she
ought
not
to
have
much
inclination
for
sleepwalking

oclock
p
moh
but
i
am
tired
if
it
were
not
that
i
had
made
my
diary
a
duty
i
should
not
open
it
tonight
we
had
a
lovely
walk
lucy
after
a
while
was
in
gay
spirits
owing
i
think
to
some
dear
cows
who
came
nosing
towards
us
in
a
field
close
to
the
lighthouse
and
frightened
the
wits
out
of
us
i
believe
we
forgot
everything
except
of
course
personal
fear
and
it
seemed
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
and
give
us
a
fresh
start
we
had
a
capital
severe
tea
at
robin
hoods
bay
in
a
sweet
little
oldfashioned
inn
with
a
bowwindow
right
over
the
seaweedcovered
rocks
of
the
strand
i
believe
we
should
have
shocked
the
new
woman
with
our
appetites
men
are
more
tolerant
bless
them
then
we
walked
home
with
some
or
rather
many
stoppages
to
rest
and
with
our
hearts
full
of
a
constant
dread
of
wild
bulls
lucy
was
really
tired
and
we
intended
to
creep
off
to
bed
as
soon
as
we
could
the
young
curate
came
in
however
and
mrs
westenra
asked
him
to
stay
for
supper
lucy
and
i
had
both
a
fight
for
it
with
the
dusty
miller
i
know
it
was
a
hard
fight
on
my
part
and
i
am
quite
heroic
i
think
that
some
day
the
bishops
must
get
together
and
see
about
breeding
up
a
new
class
of
curates
who
dont
take
supper
no
matter
how
they
may
be
pressed
to
and
who
will
know
when
girls
are
tired
lucy
is
asleep
and
breathing
softly
she
has
more
colour
in
her
cheeks
than
usual
and
looks
oh
so
sweet
if
mr
holmwood
fell
in
love
with
her
seeing
her
only
in
the
drawingroom
i
wonder
what
he
would
say
if
he
saw
her
now
some
of
the
new
women
writers
will
some
day
start
an
idea
that
men
and
women
should
be
allowed
to
see
each
other
asleep
before
proposing
or
accepting
but
i
suppose
the
new
woman
wont
condescend
in
future
to
accept
she
will
do
the
proposing
herself
and
a
nice
job
she
will
make
of
it
too
theres
some
consolation
in
that
i
am
so
happy
tonight
because
dear
lucy
seems
better
i
really
believe
she
has
turned
the
corner
and
that
we
are
over
her
troubles
with
dreaming
i
should
be
quite
happy
if
i
only
knew
if
jonathan
god
bless
and
keep
him

a
mdiary
again
no
sleep
now
so
i
may
as
well
write
i
am
too
agitated
to
sleep
we
have
had
such
an
adventure
such
an
agonising
experience
i
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
i
had
closed
my
diary
suddenly
i
became
broad
awake
and
sat
up
with
a
horrible
sense
of
fear
upon
me
and
of
some
feeling
of
emptiness
around
me
the
room
was
dark
so
i
could
not
see
lucys
bed
i
stole
across
and
felt
for
her
the
bed
was
empty
i
lit
a
match
and
found
that
she
was
not
in
the
room
the
door
was
shut
but
not
locked
as
i
had
left
it
i
feared
to
wake
her
mother
who
has
been
more
than
usually
ill
lately
so
threw
on
some
clothes
and
got
ready
to
look
for
her
as
i
was
leaving
the
room
it
struck
me
that
the
clothes
she
wore
might
give
me
some
clue
to
her
dreaming
intention
dressinggown
would
mean
house
dress
outside

and

to
myself
she
cannot
be
far
as
she
is
only
in
her
nightdress
i
ran
downstairs
and
looked
in
the
sittingroom
not
there
then
i
looked
in
all
the
other
open
rooms
of
the
house
with
an
evergrowing
fear
chilling
my
heart
finally
i
came
to
the
hall
door
and
found
it
open
it
was
not
wide
open
but
the
catch
of
the
lock
had
not
caught
the
people
of
the
house
are
careful
to
lock
the
door
every
night
so
i
feared
that
lucy
must
have
gone
out
as
she
was
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
what
might
happen
a
vague
overmastering
fear
obscured
all
details
i
took
a
big
heavy
shawl
and
ran
out
the
clock
was
striking
one
as
i
was
in
the
crescent
and
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
i
ran
along
the
north
terrace
but
could
see
no
sign
of
the
white
figure
which
i
expected
at
the
edge
of
the
west
cliff
above
the
pier
i
looked
across
the
harbour
to
the
east
cliff
in
the
hope
or
feari
dont
know
whichof
seeing
lucy
in
our
favourite
seat
there
was
a
bright
full
moon
with
heavy
black
driving
clouds
which
threw
the
whole
scene
into
a
fleeting
diorama
of
light
and
shade
as
they
sailed
across
for
a
moment
or
two
i
could
see
nothing
as
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
obscured
st
marys
church
and
all
around
it
then
as
the
cloud
passed
i
could
see
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
coming
into
view
and
as
the
edge
of
a
narrow
band
of
light
as
sharp
as
a
swordcut
moved
along
the
church
and
the
churchyard
became
gradually
visible
whatever
my
expectation
was
it
was
not
disappointed
for
there
on
our
favourite
seat
the
silver
light
of
the
moon
struck
a
halfreclining
figure
snowy
white
the
coming
of
the
cloud
was
too
quick
for
me
to
see
much
for
shadow
shut
down
on
light
almost
immediately
but
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
something
dark
stood
behind
the
seat
where
the
white
figure
shone
and
bent
over
it
what
it
was
whether
man
or
beast
i
could
not
tell
i
did
not
wait
to
catch
another
glance
but
flew
down
the
steep
steps
to
the
pier
and
along
by
the
fishmarket
to
the
bridge
which
was
the
only
way
to
reach
the
east
cliff
the
town
seemed
as
dead
for
not
a
soul
did
i
see
i
rejoiced
that
it
was
so
for
i
wanted
no
witness
of
poor
lucys
condition
the
time
and
distance
seemed
endless
and
my
knees
trembled
and
my
breath
came
laboured
as
i
toiled
up
the
endless
steps
to
the
abbey
i
must
have
gone
fast
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
my
feet
were
weighted
with
lead
and
as
though
every
joint
in
my
body
were
rusty
when
i
got
almost
to
the
top
i
could
see
the
seat
and
the
white
figure
for
i
was
now
close
enough
to
distinguish
it
even
through
the
spells
of
shadow
there
was
undoubtedly
something
long
and
black
bending
over
the
halfreclining
white
figure
i
called
in
fright
lucy
lucy
and
something
raised
a
head
and
from
where
i
was
i
could
see
a
white
face
and
red
gleaming
eyes
lucy
did
not
answer
and
i
ran
on
to
the
entrance
of
the
churchyard
as
i
entered
the
church
was
between
me
and
the
seat
and
for
a
minute
or
so
i
lost
sight
of
her
when
i
came
in
view
again
the
cloud
had
passed
and
the
moonlight
struck
so
brilliantly
that
i
could
see
lucy
half
reclining
with
her
head
lying
over
the
back
of
the
seat
she
was
quite
alone
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
any
living
thing
about
when
i
bent
over
her
i
could
see
that
she
was
still
asleep
her
lips
were
parted
and
she
was
breathingnot
softly
as
usual
with
her
but
in
long
heavy
gasps
as
though
striving
to
get
her
lungs
full
at
every
breath
as
i
came
close
she
put
up
her
hand
in
her
sleep
and
pulled
the
collar
of
her
nightdress
close
around
her
throat
whilst
she
did
so
there
came
a
little
shudder
through
her
as
though
she
felt
the
cold
i
flung
the
warm
shawl
over
her
and
drew
the
edges
tight
round
her
neck
for
i
dreaded
lest
she
should
get
some
deadly
chill
from
the
night
air
unclad
as
she
was
i
feared
to
wake
her
all
at
once
so
in
order
to
have
my
hands
free
that
i
might
help
her
i
fastened
the
shawl
at
her
throat
with
a
big
safetypin
but
i
must
have
been
clumsy
in
my
anxiety
and
pinched
or
pricked
her
with
it
for
byandby
when
her
breathing
became
quieter
she
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
again
and
moaned
when
i
had
her
carefully
wrapped
up
i
put
my
shoes
on
her
feet
and
then
began
very
gently
to
wake
her
at
first
she
did
not
respond
but
gradually
she
became
more
and
more
uneasy
in
her
sleep
moaning
and
sighing
occasionally
at
last
as
time
was
passing
fast
and
for
many
other
reasons
i
wished
to
get
her
home
at
once
i
shook
her
more
forcibly
till
finally
she
opened
her
eyes
and
awoke
she
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
me
as
of
course
she
did
not
realise
all
at
once
where
she
was
lucy
always
wakes
prettily
and
even
at
such
a
time
when
her
body
must
have
been
chilled
with
cold
and
her
mind
somewhat
appalled
at
waking
unclad
in
a
churchyard
at
night
she
did
not
lose
her
grace
she
trembled
a
little
and
clung
to
me
when
i
told
her
to
come
at
once
with
me
home
she
rose
without
a
word
with
the
obedience
of
a
child
as
we
passed
along
the
gravel
hurt
my
feet
and
lucy
noticed
me
wince
she
stopped
and
wanted
to
insist
upon
my
taking
my
shoes
but
i
would
not
however
when
we
got
to
the
pathway
outside
the
churchyard
where
there
was
a
puddle
of
water
remaining
from
the
storm
i
daubed
my
feet
with
mud
using
each
foot
in
turn
on
the
other
so
that
as
we
went
home
no
one
in
case
we
should
meet
any
one
should
notice
my
bare
feet
fortune
favoured
us
and
we
got
home
without
meeting
a
soul
once
we
saw
a
man
who
seemed
not
quite
sober
passing
along
a
street
in
front
of
us
but
we
hid
in
a
door
till
he
had
disappeared
up
an
opening
such
as
there
are
here
steep
little
closes
or
wynds
as
they
call
them
in
scotland
my
heart
beat
so
loud
all
the
time
that
sometimes
i
thought
i
should
faint
i
was
filled
with
anxiety
about
lucy
not
only
for
her
health
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
exposure
but
for
her
reputation
in
case
the
story
should
get
wind
when
we
got
in
and
had
washed
our
feet
and
had
said
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
together
i
tucked
her
into
bed
before
falling
asleep
she
askedeven
imploredme
not
to
say
a
word
to
any
one
even
her
mother
about
her
sleepwalking
adventure
i
hesitated
at
first
to
promise
but
on
thinking
of
the
state
of
her
mothers
health
and
how
the
knowledge
of
such
a
thing
would
fret
her
and
thinking
too
of
how
such
a
story
might
become
distortednay
infallibly
wouldin
case
it
should
leak
out
i
thought
it
wiser
to
do
so
i
hope
i
did
right
i
have
locked
the
door
and
the
key
is
tied
to
my
wrist
so
perhaps
i
shall
not
be
again
disturbed
lucy
is
sleeping
soundly
the
reflex
of
the
dawn
is
high
and
far
over
the
sea





same
day
noonall
goes
well
lucy
slept
till
i
woke
her
and
seemed
not
to
have
even
changed
her
side
the
adventure
of
the
night
does
not
seem
to
have
harmed
her
on
the
contrary
it
has
benefited
her
for
she
looks
better
this
morning
than
she
has
done
for
weeks
i
was
sorry
to
notice
that
my
clumsiness
with
the
safetypin
hurt
her
indeed
it
might
have
been
serious
for
the
skin
of
her
throat
was
pierced
i
must
have
pinched
up
a
piece
of
loose
skin
and
have
transfixed
it
for
there
are
two
little
red
points
like
pinpricks
and
on
the
band
of
her
nightdress
was
a
drop
of
blood
when
i
apologised
and
was
concerned
about
it
she
laughed
and
petted
me
and
said
she
did
not
even
feel
it
fortunately
it
cannot
leave
a
scar
as
it
is
so
tiny





same
day
nightwe
passed
a
happy
day
the
air
was
clear
and
the
sun
bright
and
there
was
a
cool
breeze
we
took
our
lunch
to
mulgrave
woods
mrs
westenra
driving
by
the
road
and
lucy
and
i
walking
by
the
cliffpath
and
joining
her
at
the
gate
i
felt
a
little
sad
myself
for
i
could
not
but
feel
how
absolutely
happy
it
would
have
been
had
jonathan
been
with
me
but
there
i
must
only
be
patient
in
the
evening
we
strolled
in
the
casino
terrace
and
heard
some
good
music
by
spohr
and
mackenzie
and
went
to
bed
early
lucy
seems
more
restful
than
she
has
been
for
some
time
and
fell
asleep
at
once
i
shall
lock
the
door
and
secure
the
key
the
same
as
before
though
i
do
not
expect
any
trouble
tonight





12
augustmy
expectations
were
wrong
for
twice
during
the
night
i
was
wakened
by
lucy
trying
to
get
out
she
seemed
even
in
her
sleep
to
be
a
little
impatient
at
finding
the
door
shut
and
went
back
to
bed
under
a
sort
of
protest
i
woke
with
the
dawn
and
heard
the
birds
chirping
outside
of
the
window
lucy
woke
too
and
i
was
glad
to
see
was
even
better
than
on
the
previous
morning
all
her
old
gaiety
of
manner
seemed
to
have
come
back
and
she
came
and
snuggled
in
beside
me
and
told
me
all
about
arthur
i
told
her
how
anxious
i
was
about
jonathan
and
then
she
tried
to
comfort
me
well
she
succeeded
somewhat
for
though
sympathy
cant
alter
facts
it
can
help
to
make
them
more
bearable





13
augustanother
quiet
day
and
to
bed
with
the
key
on
my
wrist
as
before
again
i
awoke
in
the
night
and
found
lucy
sitting
up
in
bed
still
asleep
pointing
to
the
window
i
got
up
quietly
and
pulling
aside
the
blind
looked
out
it
was
brilliant
moonlight
and
the
soft
effect
of
the
light
over
the
sea
and
skymerged
together
in
one
great
silent
mysterywas
beautiful
beyond
words
between
me
and
the
moonlight
flitted
a
great
bat
coming
and
going
in
great
whirling
circles
once
or
twice
it
came
quite
close
but
was
i
suppose
frightened
at
seeing
me
and
flitted
away
across
the
harbour
towards
the
abbey
when
i
came
back
from
the
window
lucy
had
lain
down
again
and
was
sleeping
peacefully
she
did
not
stir
again
all
night





14
auguston
the
east
cliff
reading
and
writing
all
day
lucy
seems
to
have
become
as
much
in
love
with
the
spot
as
i
am
and
it
is
hard
to
get
her
away
from
it
when
it
is
time
to
come
home
for
lunch
or
tea
or
dinner
this
afternoon
she
made
a
funny
remark
we
were
coming
home
for
dinner
and
had
come
to
the
top
of
the
steps
up
from
the
west
pier
and
stopped
to
look
at
the
view
as
we
generally
do
the
setting
sun
low
down
in
the
sky
was
just
dropping
behind
kettleness
the
red
light
was
thrown
over
on
the
east
cliff
and
the
old
abbey
and
seemed
to
bathe
everything
in
a
beautiful
rosy
glow
we
were
silent
for
a
while
and
suddenly
lucy
murmured
as
if
to
herself
his
red
eyes
again
they
are
just
the
same
it
was
such
an
odd
expression
coming
apropos
of
nothing
that
it
quite
startled
me
i
slewed
round
a
little
so
as
to
see
lucy
well
without
seeming
to
stare
at
her
and
saw
that
she
was
in
a
halfdreamy
state
with
an
odd
look
on
her
face
that
i
could
not
quite
make
out
so
i
said
nothing
but
followed
her
eyes
she
appeared
to
be
looking
over
at
our
own
seat
whereon
was
a
dark
figure
seated
alone
i
was
a
little
startled
myself
for
it
seemed
for
an
instant
as
if
the
stranger
had
great
eyes
like
burning
flames
but
a
second
look
dispelled
the
illusion
the
red
sunlight
was
shining
on
the
windows
of
st
marys
church
behind
our
seat
and
as
the
sun
dipped
there
was
just
sufficient
change
in
the
refraction
and
reflection
to
make
it
appear
as
if
the
light
moved
i
called
lucys
attention
to
the
peculiar
effect
and
she
became
herself
with
a
start
but
she
looked
sad
all
the
same
it
may
have
been
that
she
was
thinking
of
that
terrible
night
up
there
we
never
refer
to
it
so
i
said
nothing
and
we
went
home
to
dinner
lucy
had
a
headache
and
went
early
to
bed
i
saw
her
asleep
and
went
out
for
a
little
stroll
myself
i
walked
along
the
cliffs
to
the
westward
and
was
full
of
sweet
sadness
for
i
was
thinking
of
jonathan
when
coming
homeit
was
then
bright
moonlight
so
bright
that
though
the
front
of
our
part
of
the
crescent
was
in
shadow
everything
could
be
well
seeni
threw
a
glance
up
at
our
window
and
saw
lucys
head
leaning
out
i
thought
that
perhaps
she
was
looking
out
for
me
so
i
opened
my
handkerchief
and
waved
it
she
did
not
notice
or
make
any
movement
whatever
just
then
the
moonlight
crept
round
an
angle
of
the
building
and
the
light
fell
on
the
window
there
distinctly
was
lucy
with
her
head
lying
up
against
the
side
of
the
windowsill
and
her
eyes
shut
she
was
fast
asleep
and
by
her
seated
on
the
windowsill
was
something
that
looked
like
a
goodsized
bird
i
was
afraid
she
might
get
a
chill
so
i
ran
upstairs
but
as
i
came
into
the
room
she
was
moving
back
to
her
bed
fast
asleep
and
breathing
heavily
she
was
holding
her
hand
to
her
throat
as
though
to
protect
it
from
cold
i
did
not
wake
her
but
tucked
her
up
warmly
i
have
taken
care
that
the
door
is
locked
and
the
window
securely
fastened
she
looks
so
sweet
as
she
sleeps
but
she
is
paler
than
is
her
wont
and
there
is
a
drawn
haggard
look
under
her
eyes
which
i
do
not
like
i
fear
she
is
fretting
about
something
i
wish
i
could
find
out
what
it
is

augustrose
later
than
usual
lucy
was
languid
and
tired
and
slept
on
after
we
had
been
called
we
had
a
happy
surprise
at
breakfast
arthurs
father
is
better
and
wants
the
marriage
to
come
off
soon
lucy
is
full
of
quiet
joy
and
her
mother
is
glad
and
sorry
at
once
later
on
in
the
day
she
told
me
the
cause
she
is
grieved
to
lose
lucy
as
her
very
own
but
she
is
rejoiced
that
she
is
soon
to
have
some
one
to
protect
her
poor
dear
sweet
lady
she
confided
to
me
that
she
has
got
her
deathwarrant
she
has
not
told
lucy
and
made
me
promise
secrecy
her
doctor
told
her
that
within
a
few
months
at
most
she
must
die
for
her
heart
is
weakening
at
any
time
even
now
a
sudden
shock
would
be
almost
sure
to
kill
her
ah
we
were
wise
to
keep
from
her
the
affair
of
the
dreadful
night
of
lucys
sleepwalking

diary
for
two
whole
days
i
have
not
had
the
heart
to
write
some
sort
of
shadowy
pall
seems
to
be
coming
over
our
happiness
no
news
from
jonathan
and
lucy
seems
to
be
growing
weaker
whilst
her
mothers
hours
are
numbering
to
a
close
i
do
not
understand
lucys
fading
away
as
she
is
doing
she
eats
well
and
sleeps
well
and
enjoys
the
fresh
air
but
all
the
time
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
are
fading
and
she
gets
weaker
and
more
languid
day
by
day
at
night
i
hear
her
gasping
as
if
for
air
i
keep
the
key
of
our
door
always
fastened
to
my
wrist
at
night
but
she
gets
up
and
walks
about
the
room
and
sits
at
the
open
window
last
night
i
found
her
leaning
out
when
i
woke
up
and
when
i
tried
to
wake
her
i
could
not
she
was
in
a
faint
when
i
managed
to
restore
her
she
was
as
weak
as
water
and
cried
silently
between
long
painful
struggles
for
breath
when
i
asked
her
how
she
came
to
be
at
the
window
she
shook
her
head
and
turned
away
i
trust
her
feeling
ill
may
not
be
from
that
unlucky
prick
of
the
safetypin
i
looked
at
her
throat
just
now
as
she
lay
asleep
and
the
tiny
wounds
seem
not
to
have
healed
they
are
still
open
and
if
anything
larger
than
before
and
the
edges
of
them
are
faintly
white
they
are
like
little
white
dots
with
red
centres
unless
they
heal
within
a
day
or
two
i
shall
insist
on
the
doctor
seeing
about
them

18
augusti
am
happy
today
and
write
sitting
on
the
seat
in
the
churchyard
lucy
is
ever
so
much
better
last
night
she
slept
well
all
night
and
did
not
disturb
me
once
the
roses
seem
coming
back
already
to
her
cheeks
though
she
is
still
sadly
pale
and
wanlooking
if
she
were
in
any
way
anmic
i
could
understand
it
but
she
is
not
she
is
in
gay
spirits
and
full
of
life
and
cheerfulness
all
the
morbid
reticence
seems
to
have
passed
from
her
and
she
has
just
reminded
me
as
if
i
needed
any
reminding
of
that
night
and
that
it
was
here
on
this
very
seat
i
found
her
asleep
as
she
told
me
she
tapped
playfully
with
the
heel
of
her
boot
on
the
stone
slab
and
said
my
poor
little
feet
didnt
make
much
noise
then
i
daresay
poor
old
mr
swales
would
have
told
me
that
it
was
because
i
didnt
want
to
wake
up
geordie
as
she
was
in
such
a
communicative
humour
i
asked
her
if
she
had
dreamed
at
all
that
night
before
she
answered
that
sweet
puckered
look
came
into
her
forehead
which
arthuri
call
him
arthur
from
her
habitsays
he
loves
and
indeed
i
dont
wonder
that
he
does
then
she
went
on
in
a
halfdreaming
kind
of
way
as
if
trying
to
recall
it
to
herself
i
didnt
quite
dream
but
it
all
seemed
to
be
real
i
only
wanted
to
be
here
in
this
spoti
dont
know
why
for
i
was
afraid
of
somethingi
dont
know
what
i
remember
though
i
suppose
i
was
asleep
passing
through
the
streets
and
over
the
bridge
a
fish
leaped
as
i
went
by
and
i
leaned
over
to
look
at
it
and
i
heard
a
lot
of
dogs
howlingthe
whole
town
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
full
of
dogs
all
howling
at
onceas
i
went
up
the
steps
then
i
had
a
vague
memory
of
something
long
and
dark
with
red
eyes
just
as
we
saw
in
the
sunset
and
something
very
sweet
and
very
bitter
all
around
me
at
once
and
then
i
seemed
sinking
into
deep
green
water
and
there
was
a
singing
in
my
ears
as
i
have
heard
there
is
to
drowning
men
and
then
everything
seemed
passing
away
from
me
my
soul
seemed
to
go
out
from
my
body
and
float
about
the
air
i
seem
to
remember
that
once
the
west
lighthouse
was
right
under
me
and
then
there
was
a
sort
of
agonising
feeling
as
if
i
were
in
an
earthquake
and
i
came
back
and
found
you
shaking
my
body
i
saw
you
do
it
before
i
felt
you
then
she
began
to
laugh
it
seemed
a
little
uncanny
to
me
and
i
listened
to
her
breathlessly
i
did
not
quite
like
it
and
thought
it
better
not
to
keep
her
mind
on
the
subject
so
we
drifted
on
to
other
subjects
and
lucy
was
like
her
old
self
again
when
we
got
home
the
fresh
breeze
had
braced
her
up
and
her
pale
cheeks
were
really
more
rosy
her
mother
rejoiced
when
she
saw
her
and
we
all
spent
a
very
happy
evening
together

write
by
desire
of
mr
jonathan
harker

is
himself
not
strong
enough
to
write
though
progressing
well
thanks
to
god
and
st
joseph
and
ste
mary
he
has
been
under
our
care
for
nearly
six
weeks
suffering
from
a
violent
brain
fever
he
wishes
me
to
convey
his
love
and
to
say
that
by
this
post
i
write
for
him
to
mr
peter
hawkins
exeter
to
say
with
his
dutiful
respects
that
he
is
sorry
for
his
delay
and
that
all
of
his
work
is
completed
he
will
require
some
few
weeks
rest
in
our
sanatorium
in
the
hills
but
will
then
return
he
wishes
me
to
say
that
he
has
not
sufficient
money
with
him
and
that
he
would
like
to
pay
for
his
staying
here
so
that
others
who
need
shall
not

agatha
p
smy
patient
being
asleep
i
open
this
to
let
you
know
something
more
he
has
told
me
all
about
you
and
that
you
are
shortly
to
be
his
wife
all
blessings
to
you
both
he
has
had
some
fearful
shockso
says
our
doctorand
in
his
delirium
his
ravings
have
been
dreadful
of
wolves
and
poison
and
blood
of
ghosts
and
demons
and
i
fear
to
say
of
what
be
careful
with
him
always
that
there
may
be
nothing
to
excite
him
of
this
kind
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
traces
of
such
an
illness
as
his
do
not
lightly
die
away
we
should
have
written
long
ago
but
we
knew
nothing
of
his
friends
and
there
was
on
him
nothing
that
any
one
could
understand
he
came
in
the
train
from
klausenburg
and
the
guard
was
told
by
the
stationmaster
there
that
he
rushed
into
the
station
shouting
for
a
ticket
for
home
seeing
from
his
violent
demeanour
that
he
was
english
they
gave
him
a
ticket
for
the
furthest
station
on
the
way
thither
that
the
train
reached
be
assured
that
he
is
well
cared
for
he
has
won
all
hearts
by
his
sweetness
and
gentleness
he
is
truly
getting
on
well
and
i
have
no
doubt
will
in
a
few
weeks
be
all
himself
but
be
careful
of
him
for
safetys
sake
there
are
i
pray
god
and
st
joseph
and

many

19
auguststrange
and
sudden
change
in
renfield
last
night
about
eight
oclock
he
began
to
get
excited
and
sniff
about
as
a
dog
does
when
setting
the
attendant
was
struck
by
his
manner
and
knowing
my
interest
in
him
encouraged
him
to
talk
he
is
usually
respectful
to
the
attendant
and
at
times
servile
but
tonight
the
man
tells
me
he
was
quite
haughty
would
not
condescend
to
talk
with
him
at
all
all
he
would
say
was
i
dont
want
to
talk
to
you
you
dont
count
now
the
master
is
at
hand
the
attendant
thinks
it
is
some
sudden
form
of
religious
mania
which
has
seized
him
if
so
we
must
look
out
for
squalls
for
a
strong
man
with
homicidal
and
religious
mania
at
once
might
be
dangerous
the
combination
is
a
dreadful
one
at
nine
oclock
i
visited
him
myself
his
attitude
to
me
was
the
same
as
that
to
the
attendant
in
his
sublime
selffeeling
the
difference
between
myself
and
attendant
seemed
to
him
as
nothing
it
looks
like
religious
mania
and
he
will
soon
think
that
he
himself
is
god
these
infinitesimal
distinctions
between
man
and
man
are
too
paltry
for
an
omnipotent
being
how
these
madmen
give
themselves
away
the
real
god
taketh
heed
lest
a
sparrow
fall
but
the
god
created
from
human
vanity
sees
no
difference
between
an
eagle
and
a
sparrow
oh
if
men
only
knew
for
half
an
hour
or
more
renfield
kept
getting
excited
in
greater
and
greater
degree
i
did
not
pretend
to
be
watching
him
but
i
kept
strict
observation
all
the
same
all
at
once
that
shifty
look
came
into
his
eyes
which
we
always
see
when
a
madman
has
seized
an
idea
and
with
it
the
shifty
movement
of
the
head
and
back
which
asylum
attendants
come
to
know
so
well
he
became
quite
quiet
and
went
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
resignedly
and
looked
into
space
with
lacklustre
eyes
i
thought
i
would
find
out
if
his
apathy
were
real
or
only
assumed
and
tried
to
lead
him
to
talk
of
his
pets
a
theme
which
had
never
failed
to
excite
his
attention
at
first
he
made
no
reply
but
at
length
said
testily
bother
them
all
i
dont
care
a
pin
about
them
what
i
said
you
dont
mean
to
tell
me
you
dont
care
about
spiders
spiders
at
present
are
his
hobby
and
the
notebook
is
filling
up
with
columns
of
small
figures
to
this
he
answered
enigmatically
the
bridemaidens
rejoice
the
eyes
that
wait
the
coming
of
the
bride
but
when
the
bride
draweth
nigh
then
the
maidens
shine
not
to
the
eyes
that
are
filled
he
would
not
explain
himself
but
remained
obstinately
seated
on
his
bed
all
the
time
i
remained
with
him
i
am
weary
tonight
and
low
in
spirits
i
cannot
but
think
of
lucy
and
how
different
things
might
have
been
if
i
dont
sleep
at
once
chloral

i
must
be

not
to
let
it
grow
into

i
shall
take

of

laterglad
i
made
the
resolution
gladder
that
i
kept
to
it
i
had
lain
tossing
about
and
had
heard
the
clock
strike
only
twice
when
the
nightwatchman
came
to
me
sent
up
from
the
ward
to
say
that
renfield
had
escaped
i
threw
on
my
clothes
and
ran
down
at
once
my
patient
is
too
dangerous
a
person
to
be
roaming
about
those
ideas
of
his
might
work
out
dangerously
with
strangers
the
attendant
was
waiting
for
me
he
said
he
had
seen
him
not
ten
minutes
before
seemingly
asleep
in
his
bed
when
he
had
looked
through
the
observationtrap
in
the
door
his
attention
was
called
by
the
sound
of
the
window
being
wrenched
out
he
ran
back
and
saw
his
feet
disappear
through
the
window
and
had
at
once
sent
up
for
me
he
was
only
in
his
nightgear
and
cannot
be
far
off
the
attendant
thought
it
would
be
more
useful
to
watch
where
he
should
go
than
to
follow
him
as
he
might
lose
sight
of
him
whilst
getting
out
of
the
building
by
the
door
he
is
a
bulky
man
and
couldnt
get
through
the
window
i
am
thin
so
with
his
aid
i
got
out
but
feet
foremost
and
as
we
were
only
a
few
feet
above
ground
landed
unhurt
the
attendant
told
me
the
patient
had
gone
to
the
left
and
had
taken
a
straight
line
so
i
ran
as
quickly
as
i
could
as
i
got
through
the
belt
of
trees
i
saw
a
white
figure
scale
the
high
wall
which
separates
our
grounds
from
those
of
the
deserted
house
i
ran
back
at
once
told
the
watchman
to
get
three
or
four
men
immediately
and
follow
me
into
the
grounds
of
carfax
in
case
our
friend
might
be
dangerous
i
got
a
ladder
myself
and
crossing
the
wall
dropped
down
on
the
other
side
i
could
see
renfields
figure
just
disappearing
behind
the
angle
of
the
house
so
i
ran
after
him
on
the
far
side
of
the
house
i
found
him
pressed
close
against
the
old
ironbound
oak
door
of
the
chapel
he
was
talking
apparently
to
some
one
but
i
was
afraid
to
go
near
enough
to
hear
what
he
was
saying
lest
i
might
frighten
him
and
he
should
run
off
chasing
an
errant
swarm
of
bees
is
nothing
to
following
a
naked
lunatic
when
the
fit
of
escaping
is
upon
him
after
a
few
minutes
however
i
could
see
that
he
did
not
take
note
of
anything
around
him
and
so
ventured
to
draw
nearer
to
himthe
more
so
as
my
men
had
now
crossed
the
wall
and
were
closing
him
in
i
heard
him
say
i
am
here
to
do
your
bidding
master
i
am
your
slave
and
you
will
reward
me
for
i
shall
be
faithful
i
have
worshipped
you
long
and
afar
off
now
that
you
are
near
i
await
your
commands
and
you
will
not
pass
me
by
will
you
dear
master
in
your
distribution
of
good
things
he
is
a
selfish
old
beggar
anyhow
he
thinks
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
even
when
he
believes
he
is
in
a
real
presence
his
manias
make
a
startling
combination
when
we
closed
in
on
him
he
fought
like
a
tiger
he
is
immensely
strong
for
he
was
more
like
a
wild
beast
than
a
man
i
never
saw
a
lunatic
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
rage
before
and
i
hope
i
shall
not
again
it
is
a
mercy
that
we
have
found
out
his
strength
and
his
danger
in
good
time
with
strength
and
determination
like
his
he
might
have
done
wild
work
before
he
was
caged
he
is
safe
now
at
any
rate
jack
sheppard
himself
couldnt
get
free
from
the
straitwaistcoat
that
keeps
him
restrained
and
hes
chained
to
the
wall
in
the
padded
room
his
cries
are
at
times
awful
but
the
silences
that
follow
are
more
deadly
still
for
he
means
murder
in
every
turn
and
movement
just
now
he
spoke
coherent
words
for
the
first
time
i
shall
be
patient
master
it
is
comingcomingcoming
so
i
took
the
hint
and
came
too
i
was
too
excited
to
sleep
but
this
diary
has
quieted
me
and
i
feel
i
shall
get
some
sleep
tonight

august
my
dearest
lucy
i
know
you
will
be
anxious
to
hear
all
that
has
happened
since
we
parted
at
the
railway
station
at
whitby
well
my
dear
i
got
to
hull
all
right
and
caught
the
boat
to
hamburg
and
then
the
train
on
here
i
feel
that
i
can
hardly
recall
anything
of
the
journey
except
that
i
knew
i
was
coming
to
jonathan
and
that
as
i
should
have
to
do
some
nursing
i
had
better
get
all
the
sleep
i
could
i
found
my
dear
one
oh
so
thin
and
pale
and
weaklooking
all
the
resolution
has
gone
out
of
his
dear
eyes
and
that
quiet
dignity
which
i
told
you
was
in
his
face
has
vanished
he
is
only
a
wreck
of
himself
and
he
does
not
remember
anything
that
has
happened
to
him
for
a
long
time
past
at
least
he
wants
me
to
believe
so
and
i
shall
never
ask
he
has
had
some
terrible
shock
and
i
fear
it
might
tax
his
poor
brain
if
he
were
to
try
to
recall
it
sister
agatha
who
is
a
good
creature
and
a
born
nurse
tells
me
that
he
raved
of
dreadful
things
whilst
he
was
off
his
head
i
wanted
her
to
tell
me
what
they
were
but
she
would
only
cross
herself
and
say
she
would
never
tell
that
the
ravings
of
the
sick
were
the
secrets
of
god
and
that
if
a
nurse
through
her
vocation
should
hear
them
she
should
respect
her
trust
she
is
a
sweet
good
soul
and
the
next
day
when
she
saw
i
was
troubled
she
opened
up
the
subject
again
and
after
saying
that
she
could
never
mention
what
my
poor
dear
raved
about
added
i
can
tell
you
this
much
my
dear
that
it
was
not
about
anything
which
he
has
done
wrong
himself
and
you
as
his
wife
to
be
have
no
cause
to
be
concerned
he
has
not
forgotten
you
or
what
he
owes
to
you
his
fear
was
of
great
and
terrible
things
which
no
mortal
can
treat
of
i
do
believe
the
dear
soul
thought
i
might
be
jealous
lest
my
poor
dear
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
any
other
girl
the
idea
of
my
being
jealous
about
jonathan
and
yet
my
dear
let
me
whisper
i
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
through
me
when
i
knew
that
no
other
woman
was
a
cause
of
trouble
i
am
now
sitting
by
his
bedside
where
i
can
see
his
face
while
he
sleeps
he
is
waking
when
he
woke
he
asked
me
for
his
coat
as
he
wanted
to
get
something
from
the
pocket
i
asked
sister
agatha
and
she
brought
all
his
things
i
saw
that
amongst
them
was
his
notebook
and
was
going
to
ask
him
to
let
me
look
at
itfor
i
knew
then
that
i
might
find
some
clue
to
his
troublebut
i
suppose
he
must
have
seen
my
wish
in
my
eyes
for
he
sent
me
over
to
the
window
saying
he
wanted
to
be
quite
alone
for
a
moment
then
he
called
me
back
and
when
i
came
he
had
his
hand
over
the
notebook
and
he
said
to
me
very
solemnly
wilhelminai
knew
then
that
he
was
in
deadly
earnest
for
he
has
never
called
me
by
that
name
since
he
asked
me
to
marry
himyou
know
dear
my
ideas
of
the
trust
between
husband
and
wife
there
should
be
no
secret
no
concealment
i
have
had
a
great
shock
and
when
i
try
to
think
of
what
it
is
i
feel
my
head
spin
round
and
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
all
real
or
the
dreaming
of
a
madman
you
know
i
have
had
brain
fever
and
that
is
to
be
mad
the
secret
is
here
and
i
do
not
want
to
know
it
i
want
to
take
up
my
life
here
with
our
marriage
for
my
dear
we
had
decided
to
be
married
as
soon
as
the
formalities
are
complete
are
you
willing
wilhelmina
to
share
my
ignorance
here
is
the
book
take
it
and
keep
it
read
it
if
you
will
but
never
let
me
know
unless
indeed
some
solemn
duty
should
come
upon
me
to
go
back
to
the
bitter
hours
asleep
or
awake
sane
or
mad
recorded
here
he
fell
back
exhausted
and
i
put
the
book
under
his
pillow
and
kissed
him
i
have
asked
sister
agatha
to
beg
the
superior
to
let
our
wedding
be
this
afternoon
and
am
waiting
her
reply





she
has
come
and
told
me
that
the
chaplain
of
the
english
mission
church
has
been
sent
for
we
are
to
be
married
in
an
hour
or
as
soon
after
as
jonathan
awakes





lucy
the
time
has
come
and
gone
i
feel
very
solemn
but
very
very
happy
jonathan
woke
a
little
after
the
hour
and
all
was
ready
and
he
sat
up
in
bed
propped
up
with
pillows
he
answered
his
i
will
firmly
and
strongly
i
could
hardly
speak
my
heart
was
so
full
that
even
those
words
seemed
to
choke
me
the
dear
sisters
were
so
kind
please
god
i
shall
never
never
forget
them
nor
the
grave
and
sweet
responsibilities
i
have
taken
upon
me
i
must
tell
you
of
my
wedding
present
when
the
chaplain
and
the
sisters
had
left
me
alone
with
my
husbandoh
lucy
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
written
the
words
my
husbandleft
me
alone
with
my
husband
i
took
the
book
from
under
his
pillow
and
wrapped
it
up
in
white
paper
and
tied
it
with
a
little
bit
of
pale
blue
ribbon
which
was
round
my
neck
and
sealed
it
over
the
knot
with
sealingwax
and
for
my
seal
i
used
my
wedding
ring
then
i
kissed
it
and
showed
it
to
my
husband
and
told
him
that
i
would
keep
it
so
and
then
it
would
be
an
outward
and
visible
sign
for
us
all
our
lives
that
we
trusted
each
other
that
i
would
never
open
it
unless
it
were
for
his
own
dear
sake
or
for
the
sake
of
some
stern
duty
then
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
oh
lucy
it
was
the
first
time
he
took
his
wifes
hand
and
said
that
it
was
the
dearest
thing
in
all
the
wide
world
and
that
he
would
go
through
all
the
past
again
to
win
it
if
need
be
the
poor
dear
meant
to
have
said
a
part
of
the
past
but
he
cannot
think
of
time
yet
and
i
shall
not
wonder
if
at
first
he
mixes
up
not
only
the
month
but
the
year
well
my
dear
what
could
i
say
i
could
only
tell
him
that
i
was
the
happiest
woman
in
all
the
wide
world
and
that
i
had
nothing
to
give
him
except
myself
my
life
and
my
trust
and
that
with
these
went
my
love
and
duty
for
all
the
days
of
my
life
and
my
dear
when
he
kissed
me
and
drew
me
to
him
with
his
poor
weak
hands
it
was
like
a
very
solemn
pledge
between
us
lucy
dear
do
you
know
why
i
tell
you
all
this
it
is
not
only
because
it
is
all
sweet
to
me
but
because
you
have
been
and
are
very
dear
to
me
it
was
my
privilege
to
be
your
friend
and
guide

you
came
from
the
schoolroom
to
prepare

i
want
you

me

and
sleep
well
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
i
have
quite
given
up
walking
in
my
sleep
i
think
i
have
not
stirred
out
of
my
bed
for
a
week
that
is
when
i
once
got
into
it
at
night
arthur
says
i
am
getting
fat
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
arthur
is
here
we
have
such
walks
and
drives
and
rides
and
rowing
and
tennis
and
fishing
together
and
i
love
him
more
than
ever
he
tells
me
that
he
loves
me
more
but
i
doubt
that
for
at
first
he
told
me
that
he
couldnt
love
me
more
than
he
did
then
but
this
is
nonsense
there
he
is
calling
to
me
so
no
more
just
at
present
from
your
loving
lucy

augustthe
case
of
renfield
grows
even
more
interesting
he
has
now
so
far
quieted
that
there
are
spells
of
cessation
from
his
passion
for
the
first
week
after
his
attack
he
was
perpetually
violent
then
one
night
just
as
the
moon
rose
he
grew
quiet
and
kept
murmuring
to
himself
now
i
can
wait
now
i
can
wait
the
attendant
came
to
tell
me
so
i
ran
down
at
once
to
have
a
look
at
him
he
was
still
in
the
straitwaistcoat
and
in
the
padded
room
but
the
suffused
look
had
gone
from
his
face
and
his
eyes
had
something
of
their
old
pleadingi
might
almost
say
cringingsoftness
i
was
satisfied
with
his
present
condition
and
directed
him
to
be
relieved
the
attendants
hesitated
but
finally
carried
out
my
wishes
without
protest
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
the
patient
had
humour
enough
to
see
their
distrust
for
coming
close
to
me
he
said
in
a
whisper
all
the
while
looking
furtively
at
them
they
think
i
could
hurt
you
fancy
me
hurting
you
the
fools
it
was
soothing
somehow
to
the
feelings
to
find
myself
dissociated
even
in
the
mind
of
this
poor
madman
from
the
others
but
all
the
same
i
do
not
follow
his
thought
am
i
to
take
it
that
i
have
anything
in
common
with
him
so
that
we
are
as
it
were
to
stand
together
or
has
he
to
gain
from
me
some
good
so
stupendous
that
my
wellbeing
is
needful
to
him
i
must
find
out
later
on
tonight
he
will
not
speak
even
the
offer
of
a
kitten
or
even
a
fullgrown
cat
will
not
tempt
him
he
will
only
say
i
dont
take
any
stock
in
cats
i
have
more
to
think
of
now
and
i
can
wait
i
can
wait
after
a
while
i
left
him
the
attendant
tells
me
that
he
was
quiet
until
just
before
dawn
and
that
then
he
began
to
get
uneasy
and
at
length
violent
until
at
last
he
fell
into
a
paroxysm
which
exhausted
him
so
that
he
swooned
into
a
sort
of
coma






three
nights
has
the
same
thing
happenedviolent
all
day
then
quiet
from
moonrise
to
sunrise
i
wish
i
could
get
some
clue
to
the
cause
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
there
was
some
influence
which
came
and
went
happy
thought
we
shall
tonight
play
sane
wits
against
mad
ones
he
escaped
before
without
our
help
tonight
he
shall
escape
with
it
we
shall
give
him
a
chance
and
have
the
men
ready
to
follow
in
case
they
are
required

well
disraeli
knew
life
our
bird
when
he
found
the
cage
open
would
not
fly
so
all
our
subtle
arrangements
were
for
nought
at
any
rate
we
have
proved
one
thing
that
the
spells
of
quietness
last
a
reasonable
time
we
shall
in
future
be
able
to
ease
his
bonds
for
a
few
hours
each
day
i
have
given
orders
to
the
night
attendant
merely
to
shut
him
in
the
padded
room
when
once
he
is
quiet
until
an
hour
before
sunrise
the
poor
souls
body
will
enjoy
the
relief
even
if
his
mind
cannot
appreciate

night
adventure
renfield
artfully
waited
until
the
attendant
was
entering
the
room
to
inspect
then
he
dashed
out
past
him
and
flew
down
the
passage
i
sent
word
for
the
attendants
to
follow
again
he
went
into
the
grounds
of
the
deserted
house
and
we
found
him
in
the
same
place
pressed
against
the
old
chapel
door
when
he
saw
me
he
became
furious
and
had
not
the
attendants
seized
him
in
time
he
would
have
tried
to
kill
me
as
we
were
holding
him
a
strange
thing
happened
he
suddenly
redoubled
his
efforts
and
then
as
suddenly
grew
calm
i
looked
round
instinctively
but
could
see
nothing
then
i
caught
the
patients
eye
and
followed
it
but
could
trace
nothing
as
it
looked
into
the
moonlit
sky
except
a
big
bat
which
was
flapping
its
silent
and
ghostly
way
to
the
west
bats
usually
wheel
and
flit
about
but
this
one
seemed
to
go
straight
on
as
if
it
knew
where
it
was
bound
for
or
had
some
intention
of
its
own
the
patient
grew
calmer
every
instant
and
presently
said
you
neednt
tie
me
i
shall
go
quietly
without
trouble
we
came
back
to
the
house
i
feel
there
is
something
ominous
in
his
calm
and
shall
not
forget

meet
i
wonder
when
it
will
be
i
wish
she
were
with
me
again
for
i
feel
so
unhappy
last
night
i
seemed
to
be
dreaming
again
just
as
i
was
at
whitby
perhaps
it
is
the
change
of
air
or
getting
home
again
it
is
all
dark
and
horrid
to
me
for
i
can
remember
nothing
but
i
am
full
of
vague
fear
and
i
feel
so
weak
and
worn
out
when
arthur
came
to
lunch
he
looked
quite
grieved
when
he
saw
me
and
i
hadnt
the
spirit
to
try
to
be
cheerful
i
wonder
if
i
could
sleep
in
mothers
room
tonight
i
shall
make
an
excuse
and
try

bad
night
mother
did
not
seem
to
take
to
my
proposal
she
seems
not
too
well
herself
and
doubtless
she
fears
to
worry
me
i
tried
to
keep
awake
and
succeeded
for
a
while
but
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
it
waked
me
from
a
doze
so
i
must
have
been
falling
asleep
there
was
a
sort
of
scratching
or
flapping
at
the
window
but
i
did
not
mind
it
and
as
i
remember
no
more
i
suppose
i
must
then
have
fallen
asleep
more
bad
dreams
i
wish
i
could
remember
them
this
morning
i
am
horribly
weak
my
face
is
ghastly
pale
and
my
throat
pains
me
it
must
be
something
wrong
with
my
lungs
for
i
dont
seem
ever
to
get
air
enough
i
shall
try
to
cheer
up
when
arthur
comes
or
else
i
know
he
will
be
miserable
to
see
me

i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
lucy
is
ill
that
is
she
has
no
special
disease
but
she
looks
awful
and
is
getting
worse
every
day
i
have
asked
her
if
there
is
any
cause
i
do
not
dare
to
ask
her
mother
for
to
disturb
the
poor
ladys
mind
about
her
daughter
in
her
present
state
of
health
would
be
fatal
mrs

to
me
that
her
doom
is

heartthough
poor
lucy
does
not
know
it
yet
i
am
sure
that
there
is
something
preying
on
my
dear
girls
mind
i
am
almost
distracted
when
i
think
of
her
to
look
at
her
gives
me
a
pang
i
told
her
i
should
ask
you
to
see
her
and
though
she
demurred
at
firsti
know
why
old
fellowshe
finally
consented
it
will
be
a
painful
task
for
you
i
know
old
friend
but
it
is
for
her
sake
and
i
must
not

2
september
my
dear
old
fellow
with
regard
to
miss
westenras
health
i
hasten
to
let
you
know
at
once
that
in
my
opinion
there
is
not
any
functional
disturbance
or
any
malady
that
i
know
of
at
the
same
time
i
am
not
by
any
means
satisfied
with
her
appearance
she
is
woefully
different
from
what
she
was
when
i
saw
her
last
of
course
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
i
did
not
have
full
opportunity
of
examination
such
as
i
should
wish
our
very
friendship
makes
a
little
difficulty
which
not
even
medical
science
or
custom
can
bridge
over
i
had
better
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
leaving
you
to
draw
in
a
measure
your
own
conclusions
i
shall
then
say
what
i
have
done
and
propose
doing
i
found
miss
westenra
in
seemingly
gay
spirits
her
mother
was
present
and
in
a
few
seconds
i
made
up
my
mind
that
she
was
trying
all
she
knew
to
mislead
her
mother
and
prevent
her
from
being
anxious
i
have
no
doubt
she
guesses
if
she
does
not
know
what
need
of
caution
there
is
we
lunched
alone
and
as
we
all
exerted
ourselves
to
be
cheerful
we
got
as
some
kind
of
reward
for
our
labours
some
real
cheerfulness
amongst
us
then
mrs
westenra
went
to
lie
down
and
lucy
was
left
with
me
we
went
into
her
boudoir
and
till
we
got
there
her
gaiety
remained
for
the
servants
were
coming
and
going
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
however
the
mask
fell
from
her
face
and
she
sank
down
into
a
chair
with
a
great
sigh
and
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hand
when
i
saw
that
her
high
spirits
had
failed
i
at
once
took
advantage
of
her
reaction
to
make
a
diagnosis
she
said
to
me
very
sweetly
i
cannot
tell
you
how
i
loathe
talking
about
myself
i
reminded
her
that
a
doctors
confidence
was
sacred
but
that
you
were
grievously
anxious
about
her
she
caught
on
to
my
meaning
at
once
and
settled
that
matter
in
a
word
tell
arthur
everything
you
choose
i
do
not
care
for
myself
but
all
for
him
so
i
am
quite
free
i
could
easily
see
that
she
is
somewhat
bloodless
but
i
could
not
see
the
usual
anmic
signs
and
by
a
chance
i
was
actually
able
to
test
the
quality
of
her
blood
for
in
opening
a
window
which
was
stiff
a
cord
gave
way
and
she
cut
her
hand
slightly
with
broken
glass
it
was
a
slight
matter
in
itself
but
it
gave
me
an
evident
chance
and
i
secured
a
few
drops
of
the
blood
and
have
analysed
them
the
qualitative
analysis
gives
a
quite
normal
condition
and
shows
i
should
infer
in
itself
a
vigorous
state
of
health
in
other
physical
matters
i
was
quite
satisfied
that
there
is
no
need
for
anxiety
but
as
there
must
be
a
cause
somewhere
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
must
be
something
mental
she
complains
of
difficulty
in
breathing
satisfactorily
at
times
and
of
heavy
lethargic
sleep
with
dreams
that
frighten
her
but
regarding
which
she
can
remember
nothing
she
says
that
as
a
child
she
used
to
walk
in
her
sleep
and
that
when
in
whitby
the
habit
came
back
and
that
once
she
walked
out
in
the
night
and
went
to
east
cliff
where
miss
murray
found
her
but
she
assures
me
that
of
late
the
habit
has
not
returned
i
am
in
doubt
and
so
have
done
the
best
thing
i
know
of
i
have
written
to
my
old
friend
and
master
professor
van
helsing
of
amsterdam
who
knows
as
much
about
obscure
diseases
as
any
one
in
the
world
i
have
asked
him
to
come
over
and
as
you
told
me
that
all
things
were
to
be
at
your
charge
i
have
mentioned
to
him
who
you
are
and
your
relations
to
miss
westenra
this
my
dear
fellow
is
in
obedience
to
your
wishes
for
i
am
only
too
proud
and
happy
to
do
anything
i
can
for
her
van
helsing
would
i
know
do
anything
for
me
for
a
personal
reason
so
no
matter
on
what
ground
he
comes
we
must
accept
his
wishes
he
is
a
seemingly
arbitrary
man
but
this
is
because
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
better
than
any
one
else
he
is
a
philosopher
and
a
metaphysician
and
one
of
the
most
advanced
scientists
of
his
day
and
he
has
i
believe
an
absolutely
open
mind
this
with
an
iron
nerve
a
temper
of
the
icebrook
an
indomitable
resolution
selfcommand
and
toleration
exalted
from
virtues
to
blessings
and
the
kindliest
and
truest
heart
that
beatsthese
form
his
equipment
for
the
noble
work
that
he
is
doing
for
mankindwork
both
in
theory
and
practice
for
his
views
are
as
wide
as
his
allembracing
sympathy
i
tell
you
these
facts
that
you
may
know
why
i
have
such
confidence
in
him
i
have
asked
him
to
come
at
once
i
shall
see
miss
westenra
tomorrow
again
she
is
to
meet
me
at

that
i
may

my

when
i
have

your

i
am
already
coming
to
you
by
good
fortune
i

at

he

to

those

holds
dear
tell
your

when

you
suck
from
my
wound
so
swiftly
the
poison
of
the
gangrene
from
that
knife
that
our

let

you
did
more

he
wants
my

you

all
his

it

likely
that
i

have
to
return
here
that
night

if

3
september
my
dear
art
van
helsing
has
come
and
gone
he
came
on
with
me
to
hillingham
and
found
that
by
lucys
discretion
her
mother
was
lunching
out
so
that
we
were
alone
with
her
van
helsing
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
patient
he
is
to
report
to
me
and
i
shall
advise
you
for
of
course
i
was
not
present
all
the
time
he
is
i
fear
much
concerned
but
says
he
must
think
when
i
told
him
of
our
friendship
and
how
you
trust
to
me
in
the
matter
he
said
you
must
tell
him
all
you
think
tell
him
what
i
think
if
you
can
guess
it
if
you
will
nay
i
am
not
jesting
this
is
no
jest
but
life
and
death
perhaps
more
i
asked
what
he
meant
by
that
for
he
was
very
serious
this
was
when
we
had
come
back
to
town
and
he
was
having
a
cup
of
tea
before
starting
on
his
return
to
amsterdam
he
would
not
give
me
any
further
clue
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
art
because
his
very
reticence
means
that
all
his
brains
are
working
for
her
good
he
will
speak
plainly
enough
when
the
time
comes
be
sure
so
i
told
him
i
would
simply
write
an
account
of
our
visit
just
as
if
i
were
doing
a
descriptive
special
article
for
the
daily
telegraph
he
seemed
not
to
notice
but
remarked
that
the
smuts
in
london
were
not
quite
so
bad
as
they
used
to
be
when
he
was
a
student
here
i
am
to
get
his
report
tomorrow
if
he
can
possibly
make
it
in
any
case
i
am
to
have
a
letter
well
as
to
the
visit
lucy
was
more
cheerful
than
on
the
day
i
first
saw
her
and
certainly
looked
better
she
had
lost
something
of
the
ghastly
look
that
so
upset
you
and
her
breathing
was
normal
she
was
very
sweet
to
the
professor
as
she
always
is
and
tried
to
make
him
feel
at
ease
though
i
could
see
that
the
poor
girl
was
making
a
hard
struggle
for
it
i
believe
van
helsing
saw
it
too
for
i
saw
the
quick
look
under
his
bushy
brows
that
i
knew
of
old
then
he
began
to
chat
of
all
things
except
ourselves
and
diseases
and
with
such
an
infinite
geniality
that
i
could
see
poor
lucys
pretense
of
animation
merge
into
reality
then
without
any
seeming
change
he
brought
the
conversation
gently
round
to
his
visit
and
suavely
said
my
dear
young
miss
i
have
the
so
great
pleasure
because
you
are
so
much
beloved
that
is
much
my
dear
ever
were
there
that
which
i
do
not
see
they
told
me
you
were
down
in
the
spirit
and
that
you
were
of
a
ghastly
pale
to
them
i
say
pouf
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
me
and
went
on
but
you
and
i
shall
show
them
how
wrong
they
are
how
can
heand
he
pointed
at
me
with
the
same
look
and
gesture
as
that
with
which
once
he
pointed
me
out
to
his
class
on
or
rather
after
a
particular
occasion
which
he
never
fails
to
remind
me
ofknow
anything
of
a
young
ladies
he
has
his
madmans
to
play
with
and
to
bring
them
back
to
happiness
and
to
those
that
love
them
it
is
much
to
do
and
oh
but
there
are
rewards
in
that
we
can
bestow
such
happiness
but
the
young
ladies
he
has
no
wife
nor
daughter
and
the
young
do
not
tell
themselves
to
the
young
but
to
the
old
like
me
who
have
known
so
many
sorrows
and
the
causes
of
them
so
my
dear
we
will
send
him
away
to
smoke
the
cigarette
in
the
garden
whiles
you
and
i
have
little
talk
all
to
ourselves
i
took
the
hint
and
strolled
about
and
presently
the
professor
came
to
the
window
and
called
me
in
he
looked
grave
but
said
i
have
made
careful
examination
but
there
is
no
functional
cause
with
you
i
agree
that
there
has
been
much
blood
lost
it
has
been
but
is
not
but
the
conditions
of
her
are
in
no
way
anmic
i
have
asked
her
to
send
me
her
maid
that
i
may
ask
just
one
or
two
question
that
so
i
may
not
chance
to
miss
nothing
i
know
well
what
she
will
say
and
yet
there
is
cause
there
is
always
cause
for
everything
i
must
go
back
home
and
think
you
must
send
to
me
the
telegram
every
day
and
if
there
be
cause
i
shall
come
again
the
diseasefor
not
to
be
all
well
is
a
diseaseinterest
me
and
the
sweet
young
dear
she
interest
me
too
she
charm
me
and
for
her
if
not
for
you
or
disease
i
come
as
i
tell
you
he
would
not
say
a
word
more
even
when
we
were
alone
and
so
now
art
you
know
all
i
know
i
shall
keep
stern
watch
i
trust
your
poor
father
is
rallying
it
must
be
a
terrible
thing
to
you
my
dear
old
fellow
to
be
placed
in
such
a
position
between
two
people
who
are
both
so
dear
to
you
i
know
your
idea
of
duty
to
your
father
and
you
are
right
to
stick
to
it
but
if
need
be
i
shall
send
you
word
to
come
at
once
to
lucy
so
do
not
be
overanxious

septemberzophagous
patient
still
keeps
up
our
interest
in
him
he
had
only
one
outburst
and
that
was
yesterday
at
an
unusual
time
just
before
the
stroke
of
noon
he
began
to
grow
restless
the
attendant
knew
the
symptoms
and
at
once
summoned
aid
fortunately
the
men
came
at
a
run
and
were
just
in
time
for
at
the
stroke
of
noon
he
became
so
violent
that
it
took
all
their
strength
to
hold
him
in
about
five
minutes
however
he
began
to
get
more
and
more
quiet
and
finally
sank
into
a
sort
of
melancholy
in
which
state
he
has
remained
up
to
now
the
attendant
tells
me
that
his
screams
whilst
in
the
paroxysm
were
really
appalling
i
found
my
hands
full
when
i
got
in
attending
to
some
of
the
other
patients
who
were
frightened
by
him
indeed
i
can
quite
understand
the
effect
for
the
sounds
disturbed
even
me
though
i
was
some
distance
away
it
is
now
after
the
dinnerhour
of
the
asylum
and
as
yet
my
patient
sits
in
a
corner
brooding
with
a
dull
sullen
woebegone
look
in
his
face
which
seems
rather
to
indicate
than
to
show
something
directly
i
cannot
quite
understand
it





lateranother
change
in
my
patient
at
five
oclock
i
looked
in
on
him
and
found
him
seemingly
as
happy
and
contented
as
he
used
to
be
he
was
catching
flies
and
eating
them
and
was
keeping
note
of
his
capture
by
making
nailmarks
on
the
edge
of
the
door
between
the
ridges
of
padding
when
he
saw
me
he
came
over
and
apologised
for
his
bad
conduct
and
asked
me
in
a
very
humble
cringing
way
to
be
led
back
to
his
own
room
and
to
have
his
notebook
again
i
thought
it
well
to
humour
him
so
he
is
back
in
his
room
with
the
window
open
he
has
the
sugar
of
his
tea
spread
out
on
the
windowsill
and
is
reaping
quite
a
harvest
of
flies
he
is
not
now
eating
them
but
putting
them
into
a
box
as
of
old
and
is
already
examining
the
corners
of
his
room
to
find
a
spider
i
tried
to
get
him
to
talk
about
the
past
few
days
for
any
clue
to
his
thoughts
would
be
of
immense
help
to
me
but
he
would
not
rise
for
a
moment
or
two
he
looked
very
sad
and
said
in
a
sort
of
faraway
voice
as
though
saying
it
rather
to
himself
than
to
me
all
over
all
over
he
has
deserted
me
no
hope
for
me
now
unless
i
do
it
for
myself
then
suddenly
turning
to
me
in
a
resolute
way
he
said
doctor
wont
you
be
very
good
to
me
and
let
me
have
a
little
more
sugar
i
think
it
would
be
good
for
me
and
the
flies
i
said
yes
the
flies
like
it
too
and
i
like
the
flies
therefore
i
like
it
and
there
are
people
who
know
so
little
as
to
think
that
madmen
do
not
argue
i
procured
him
a
double
supply
and
left
him
as
happy
a
man
as
i
suppose
any
in
the
world
i
wish
i
could
fathom
his
mind





midnightanother
change
in
him
i
had
been
to
see
miss
westenra
whom
i
found
much
better
and
had
just
returned
and
was
standing
at
our
own
gate
looking
at
the
sunset
when
once
more
i
heard
him
yelling
as
his
room
is
on
this
side
of
the
house
i
could
hear
it
better
than
in
the
morning
it
was
a
shock
to
me
to
turn
from
the
wonderful
smoky
beauty
of
a
sunset
over
london
with
its
lurid
lights
and
inky
shadows
and
all
the
marvellous
tints
that
come
on
foul
clouds
even
as
on
foul
water
and
to
realise
all
the
grim
sternness
of
my
own
cold
stone
building
with
its
wealth
of
breathing
misery
and
my
own
desolate
heart
to
endure
it
all
i
reached
him
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
and
from
his
window
saw
the
red
disc
sink
as
it
sank
he
became
less
and
less
frenzied
and
just
as
it
dipped
he
slid
from
the
hands
that
held
him
an
inert
mass
on
the
floor
it
is
wonderful
however
what
intellectual
recuperative
power
lunatics
have
for
within
a
few
minutes
he
stood
up
quite
calmly
and
looked
around
him
i
signalled
to
the
attendants
not
to
hold
him
for
i
was
anxious
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
went
straight
over
to
the
window
and
brushed
out
the
crumbs
of
sugar
then
he
took
his
flybox
and
emptied
it
outside
and
threw
away
the
box
then
he
shut
the
window
and
crossing
over
sat
down
on
his
bed
all
this
surprised
me
so
i
asked
him
are
you
not
going
to
keep
flies
any
more
no
said
he
i
am
sick
of
all
that
rubbish
he
certainly
is
a
wonderfully
interesting
study
i
wish
i
could
get
some
glimpse
of
his
mind
or
of
the
cause
of
his
sudden
passion
stop
there
may
be
a
clue
after
all
if
we
can
find
why
today
his
paroxysms
came
on
at
high
noon
and
at
sunset
can
it
be
that
there
is
a
malign
influence
of
the
sun
at
periods
which
affects
certain
naturesas
at

my
dear
art
my
news
today
is
not
so
good
lucy
this
morning
had
gone
back
a
bit
there
is
however
one
good
thing
which
has
arisen
from
it
mrs
westenra
was
naturally
anxious
concerning
lucy
and
has
consulted
me
professionally
about
her
i
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
told
her
that
my
old
master
van
helsing
the
great
specialist
was
coming
to
stay
with
me
and
that
i
would
put
her
in
his
charge
conjointly
with
myself
so
now
we
can
come
and
go
without
alarming
her
unduly
for
a
shock
to
her
would
mean
sudden
death
and
this
in
lucys
weak
condition
might
be
disastrous
to
her
we
are
hedged
in
with
difficulties
all
of
us
my
poor
old
fellow
but
please
god
we
shall
come
through
them
all
right
if
any
need
i
shall
write
so
that
if
you
do
not
hear
from
me
take
it
for
granted
that
i
am
simply
waiting

septemberthe
first
thing
van
helsing
said
to
me
when
we
met
at
liverpool
street
was
have
you
said
anything
to
our
young
friend
the
lover
of
her
no
i
said
i
waited
till
i
had
seen
you
as
i
said
in
my
telegram
i
wrote
him
a
letter
simply
telling
him
that
you
were
coming
as
miss
westenra
was
not
so
well
and
that
i
should
let
him
know
if
need
be
right
my
friend
he
said
quite
right
better
he
not
know
as
yet
perhaps
he
shall
never
know
i
pray
so
but
if
it
be
needed
then
he
shall
know
all
and
my
good
friend
john
let
me
caution
you
you
deal
with
the
madmen
all
men
are
mad
in
some
way
or
the
other
and
inasmuch
as
you
deal
discreetly
with
your
madmen
so
deal
with
gods
madmen
toothe
rest
of
the
world
you
tell
not
your
madmen
what
you
do
nor
why
you
do
it
you
tell
them
not
what
you
think
so
you
shall
keep
knowledge
in
its
place
where
it
may
restwhere
it
may
gather
its
kind
around
it
and
breed
you
and
i
shall
keep
as
yet
what
we
know
here
and
here
he
touched
me
on
the
heart
and
on
the
forehead
and
then
touched
himself
the
same
way
i
have
for
myself
thoughts
at
the
present
later
i
shall
unfold
to
you
why
not
now
i
asked
it
may
do
some
good
we
may
arrive
at
some
decision
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
and
said
my
friend
john
when
the
corn
is
grown
even
before
it
has
ripenedwhile
the
milk
of
its
motherearth
is
in
him
and
the
sunshine
has
not
yet
begun
to
paint
him
with
his
gold
the
husbandman
he
pull
the
ear
and
rub
him
between
his
rough
hands
and
blow
away
the
green
chaff
and
say
to
you
look

good
corn
he
will
make

when
the
time
comes

did
not
see
the
application
and
told
him
so
for
reply
he
reached
over
and
took
my
ear
in
his
hand
and
pulled
it
playfully
as
he
used
long
ago
to
do
at
lectures
and
said
the
good
husbandman
tell
you
so
then
because
he
knows
but
not
till
then
but
you
do
not
find
the
good
husbandman
dig
up
his
planted
corn
to
see
if
he
grow
that
is
for
the
children
who
play
at
husbandry
and
not
for
those
who
take
it
as
of
the
work
of
their
life
see
you
now
friend
john
i
have
sown
my
corn
and
nature
has
her
work
to
do
in
making
it
sprout
if
he
sprout
at
all
theres
some
promise
and
i
wait
till
the
ear
begins
to
swell
he
broke
off
for
he
evidently
saw
that
i
understood
then
he
went
on
and
very
gravely
you
were
always
a
careful
student
and
your
casebook
was
ever
more
full
than
the
rest
you
were
only
student
then
now
you
are
master
and
i
trust
that
good
habit
have
not
fail
remember
my
friend
that
knowledge
is
stronger
than
memory
and
we
should
not
trust
the
weaker
even
if
you
have
not
kept
the
good
practise
let
me
tell
you
that
this
case
of
our
dear
miss
is
one
that
may
bemind
i
say
may
beof
such
interest
to
us
and
others
that
all
the
rest
may
not
make
him
kick
the
beam
as
your
peoples
say
take
then
good
note
of
it
nothing
is
too
small
i
counsel
you
put
down
in
record
even
your
doubts
and
surmises
hereafter
it
may
be
of
interest
to
you
to
see
how
true
you
guess
we
learn
from
failure
not
from
success
when
i
described
lucys
symptomsthe
same
as
before
but
infinitely
more
markedhe
looked
very
grave
but
said
nothing
he
took
with
him
a
bag
in
which
were
many
instruments
and
drugs
the
ghastly
paraphernalia
of
our
beneficial
trade
as
he
once
called
in
one
of
his
lectures
the
equipment
of
a
professor
of
the
healing
craft
when
we
were
shown
in
mrs
westenra
met
us
she
was
alarmed
but
not
nearly
so
much
as
i
expected
to
find
her
nature
in
one
of
her
beneficent
moods
has
ordained
that
even
death
has
some
antidote
to
its
own
terrors
here
in
a
case
where
any
shock
may
prove
fatal
matters
are
so
ordered
that
from
some
cause
or
other
the
things
not
personaleven
the
terrible
change
in
her
daughter
to
whom
she
is
so
attacheddo
not
seem
to
reach
her
it
is
something
like
the
way
dame
nature
gathers
round
a
foreign
body
an
envelope
of
some
insensitive
tissue
which
can
protect
from
evil
that
which
it
would
otherwise
harm
by
contact
if
this
be
an
ordered
selfishness
then
we
should
pause
before
we
condemn
any
one
for
the
vice
of
egoism
for
there
may
be
deeper
root
for
its
causes
than
we
have
knowledge
of
i
used
my
knowledge
of
this
phase
of
spiritual
pathology
and
laid
down
a
rule
that
she
should
not
be
present
with
lucy
or
think
of
her
illness
more
than
was
absolutely
required
she
assented
readily
so
readily
that
i
saw
again
the
hand
of
nature
fighting
for
life
van
helsing
and
i
were
shown
up
to
lucys
room
if
i
was
shocked
when
i
saw
her
yesterday
i
was
horrified
when
i
saw
her
today
she
was
ghastly
chalkily
pale
the
red
seemed
to
have
gone
even
from
her
lips
and
gums
and
the
bones
of
her
face
stood
out
prominently
her
breathing
was
painful
to
see
or
hear
van
helsings
face
grew
set
as
marble
and
his
eyebrows
converged
till
they
almost
touched
over
his
nose
lucy
lay
motionless
and
did
not
seem
to
have
strength
to
speak
so
for
a
while
we
were
all
silent
then
van
helsing
beckoned
to
me
and
we
went
gently
out
of
the
room
the
instant
we
had
closed
the
door
he
stepped
quickly
along
the
passage
to
the
next
door
which
was
open
then
he
pulled
me
quickly
in
with
him
and
closed
the
door
my
god
he
said
this
is
dreadful
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
she
will
die
for
sheer
want
of
blood
to
keep
the
hearts
action
as
it
should
be
there
must
be
transfusion
of
blood
at
once
is
it
you
or
me
i
am
younger
and
stronger
professor
it
must
be
me
then
get
ready
at
once
i
will
bring
up
my
bag
i
am
prepared
i
went
downstairs
with
him
and
as
we
were
going
there
was
a
knock
at
the
halldoor
when
we
reached
the
hall
the
maid
had
just
opened
the
door
and
arthur
was
stepping
quickly
in
he
rushed
up
to
me
saying
in
an
eager
whisper
jack
i
was
so
anxious
i
read
between
the
lines
of
your
letter
and
have
been
in
an
agony
the
dad
was
better
so
i
ran
down
here
to
see
for
myself
is
not
that
gentleman
dr
van
helsing
i
am
so
thankful
to
you
sir
for
coming
when
first
the
professors
eye
had
lit
upon
him
he
had
been
angry
at
his
interruption
at
such
a
time
but
now
as
he
took
in
his
stalwart
proportions
and
recognised
the
strong
young
manhood
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
him
his
eyes
gleamed
without
a
pause
he
said
to
him
gravely
as
he
held
out
his
hand
sir
you
have
come
in
time
you
are
the
lover
of
our
dear
miss
she
is
bad
very
very
bad
nay
my
child
do
not
go
like
that
for
he
suddenly
grew
pale
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
almost
fainting
you
are
to
help
her
you
can
do
more
than
any
that
live
and
your
courage
is
your
best
help
what
can
i
do
asked
arthur
hoarsely
tell
me
and
i
shall
do
it
my
life
is
hers
and
i
would
give
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
for
her
the
professor
has
a
strongly
humorous
side
and
i
could
from
old
knowledge
detect
a
trace
of
its
origin
in
his
answer
my
young
sir
i
do
not
ask
so
much
as
thatnot
the
last
what
shall
i
do
there
was
fire
in
his
eyes
and
his
open
nostril
quivered
with
intent
van
helsing
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
come
he
said
you
are
a
man
and
it
is
a
man
we
want
you
are
better
than
me
better
than
my
friend
john
arthur
looked
bewildered
and
the
professor
went
on
by
explaining
in
a
kindly
way
young
miss
is
bad
very
bad
she
wants
blood
and
blood
she
must
have
or
die
my
friend
john
and
i
have
consulted
and
we
are
about
to
perform
what
we
call
transfusion
of
bloodto
transfer
from
full
veins
of
one
to
the
empty
veins
which
pine
for
him
john
was
to
give
his
blood
as
he
is
the
more
young
and
strong
than
mehere
arthur
took
my
hand
and
wrung
it
hard
in
silencebut
now
you
are
here
you
are
more
good
than
us
old
or
young
who
toil
much
in
the
world
of
thought
our
nerves
are
not
so
calm
and
our
blood
not
so
bright
than
yours
arthur
turned
to
him
and
said
if
you
only
knew
how
gladly
i
would
die
for
her
you
would
understand
he
stopped
with
a
sort
of
choke
in
his
voice
good
boy
said
van
helsing
in
the
notsofaroff
you
will
be
happy
that
you
have
done
all
for
her
you
love
come
now
and
be
silent
you
shall
kiss
her
once
before
it
is
done
but
then
you
must
go
and
you
must
leave
at
my
sign
say
no
word
to
madame
you
know
how
it
is
with
her
there
must
be
no
shock
any
knowledge
of
this
would
be
one
come
we
all
went
up
to
lucys
room
arthur
by
direction
remained
outside
lucy
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
us
but
said
nothing
she
was
not
asleep
but
she
was
simply
too
weak
to
make
the
effort
her
eyes
spoke
to
us
that
was
all
van
helsing
took
some
things
from
his
bag
and
laid
them
on
a
little
table
out
of
sight
then
he
mixed
a
narcotic
and
coming
over
to
the
bed
said
cheerily
now
little
miss
here
is
your
medicine
drink
it
off
like
a
good
child
see
i
lift
you
so
that
to
swallow
is
easy
yes
she
had
made
the
effort
with
success
it
astonished
me
how
long
the
drug
took
to
act
this
in
fact
marked
the
extent
of
her
weakness
the
time
seemed
endless
until
sleep
began
to
flicker
in
her
eyelids
at
last
however
the
narcotic
began
to
manifest
its
potency
and
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
when
the
professor
was
satisfied
he
called
arthur
into
the
room
and
bade
him
strip
off
his
coat
then
he
added
you
may
take
that
one
little
kiss
whiles
i
bring
over
the
table
friend
john
help
to
me
so
neither
of
us
looked
whilst
he
bent
over
her
van
helsing
turning
to
me
said
he
is
so
young
and
strong
and
of
blood
so
pure
that
we
need
not
defibrinate
it
then
with
swiftness
but
with
absolute
method
van
helsing
performed
the
operation
as
the
transfusion
went
on
something
like
life
seemed
to
come
back
to
poor
lucys
cheeks
and
through
arthurs
growing
pallor
the
joy
of
his
face
seemed
absolutely
to
shine
after
a
bit
i
began
to
grow
anxious
for
the
loss
of
blood
was
telling
on
arthur
strong
man
as
he
was
it
gave
me
an
idea
of
what
a
terrible
strain
lucys
system
must
have
undergone
that
what
weakened
arthur
only
partially
restored
her
but
the
professors
face
was
set
and
he
stood
watch
in
hand
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
now
on
the
patient
and
now
on
arthur
i
could
hear
my
own
heart
beat
presently
he
said
in
a
soft
voice
do
not
stir
an
instant
it
is
enough
you
attend
him
i
will
look
to
her
when
all
was
over
i
could
see
how
much
arthur
was
weakened
i
dressed
the
wound
and
took
his
arm
to
bring
him
away
when
van
helsing
spoke
without
turning
roundthe
man
seems
to
have
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
the
brave
lover
i
think
deserve
another
kiss
which
he
shall
have
presently
and
as
he
had
now
finished
his
operation
he
adjusted
the
pillow
to
the
patients
head
as
he
did
so
the
narrow
black
velvet
band
which
she
seems
always
to
wear
round
her
throat
buckled
with
an
old
diamond
buckle
which
her
lover
had
given
her
was
dragged
a
little
up
and
showed
a
red
mark
on
her
throat
arthur
did
not
notice
it
but
i
could
hear
the
deep
hiss
of
indrawn
breath
which
is
one
of
van
helsings
ways
of
betraying
emotion
he
said
nothing
at
the
moment
but
turned
to
me
saying
now
take
down
our
brave
young
lover
give
him
of
the
port
wine
and
let
him
lie
down
a
while
he
must
then
go
home
and
rest
sleep
much
and
eat
much
that
he
may
be
recruited
of
what
he
has
so
given
to
his
love
he
must
not
stay
here
hold
a
moment
i
may
take
it
sir
that
you
are
anxious
of
result
then
bring
it
with
you
that
in
all
ways
the
operation
is
successful
you
have
saved
her
life
this
time
and
you
can
go
home
and
rest
easy
in
mind
that
all
that
can
be
is
i
shall
tell
her
all
when
she
is
well
she
shall
love
you
none
the
less
for
what
you
have
done
goodbye
when
arthur
had
gone
i
went
back
to
the
room
lucy
was
sleeping
gently
but
her
breathing
was
stronger
i
could
see
the
counterpane
move
as
her
breast
heaved
by
the
bedside
sat
van
helsing
looking
at
her
intently
the
velvet
band
again
covered
the
red
mark
i
asked
the
professor
in
a
whisper
what
do
you
make
of
that
mark
on
her
throat
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
have
not
examined
it
yet
i
answered
and
then
and
there
proceeded
to
loose
the
band
just
over
the
external
jugular
vein
there
were
two
punctures
not
large
but
not
wholesomelooking
there
was
no
sign
of
disease
but
the
edges
were
white
and
wornlooking
as
if
by
some
trituration
it
at
once
occurred
to
me
that
this
wound
or
whatever
it
was
might
be
the
means
of
that
manifest
loss
of
blood
but
i
abandoned
the
idea
as
soon
as
formed
for
such
a
thing
could
not
be
the
whole
bed
would
have
been
drenched
to
a
scarlet
with
the
blood
which
the
girl
must
have
lost
to
leave
such
a
pallor
as
she
had
before
the
transfusion
well
said
van

answered
as
he
hurried
out
he
came
back
a
moment
later
and
put
his
head
inside
the
door
and
said
with
warning

held
up

septemberi
sat
up
all
night
with
lucy
the
opiate
worked
itself
off
towards
dusk
and
she
waked
naturally
she
looked
a
different
being
from
what
she
had
been
before
the
operation
her
spirits
even
were
good
and
she
was
full
of
a
happy
vivacity
but
i
could
see
evidences
of
the
absolute
prostration
which
she
had
undergone
when
i
told
mrs
westenra
that
dr
van
helsing
had
directed
that
i
should
sit
up
with
her
she
almost
poohpoohed
the
idea
pointing
out
her
daughters
renewed
strength
and
excellent
spirits
i
was
firm
however
and
made
preparations
for
my
long
vigil
when
her
maid
had
prepared
her
for
the
night
i
came
in
having
in
the
meantime
had
supper
and
took
a
seat
by
the
bedside
she
did
not
in
any
way
make
objection
but
looked
at
me
gratefully
whenever
i
caught
her
eye
after
a
long
spell
she
seemed
sinking
off
to
sleep
but
with
an
effort
seemed
to
pull
herself
together
and
shook
it
off
this
was
repeated
several
times
with
greater
effort
and
with
shorter
pauses
as
the
time
moved
on
it
was
apparent
that
she
did
not
want
to
sleep
so
i
tackled
the
subject
at
once
you
do
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
no
i
am
afraid
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
why
so
it
is
the
boon
we
all
crave
for
ah
not
if
you
were
like
meif
sleep
was
to
you
a
presage
of
horror
a
presage
of
horror
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
dont
know
oh
i
dont
know
and
that
is
what
is
so
terrible
all
this
weakness
comes
to
me
in
sleep
until
i
dread
the
very
thought
but
my
dear
girl
you
may
sleep
tonight
i
am
here
watching
you
and
i
can
promise
that
nothing
will
happen
ah
i
can
trust
you
i
seized
the
opportunity
and
said
i
promise
you
that
if
i
see
any
evidence
of
bad
dreams
i
will
wake
you
at
once
you
will
oh
will
you
really
how
good
you
are
to
me
then
i
will
sleep
and
almost
at
the
word
she
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
sank
back
asleep
all
night
long
i
watched
by
her
she
never
stirred
but
slept
on
and
on
in
a
deep
tranquil
lifegiving
healthgiving
sleep
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
and
her
breast
rose
and
fell
with
the
regularity
of
a
pendulum
there
was
a
smile
on
her
face
and
it
was
evident
that
no
bad
dreams
had
come
to
disturb
her
peace
of
mind
in
the
early
morning
her
maid
came
and
i
left
her
in
her
care
and
took
myself
back
home
for
i
was
anxious
about
many
things
i
sent
a
short
wire
to
van
helsing
and
to
arthur
telling
them
of
the
excellent
result
of
the
operation
my
own
work
with
its
manifold
arrears
took
me
all
day
to
clear
off
it
was
dark
when
i
was
able
to
inquire
about
my
zophagous
patient
the
report
was
good
he
had
been
quite
quiet
for
the
past
day
and
night
a
telegram
came
from
van
helsing
at
amsterdam
whilst
i
was
at
dinner
suggesting
that
i
should
be
at
hillingham
tonight
as
it
might
be
well
to
be
at
hand
and
stating
that
he
was
leaving
by
the
night
mail
and
would
join
me
early
in
the
morning





9
septemberi
was
pretty
tired
and
worn
out
when
i
got
to
hillingham
for
two
nights
i
had
hardly
had
a
wink
of
sleep
and
my
brain
was
beginning
to
feel
that
numbness
which
marks
cerebral
exhaustion
lucy
was
up
and
in
cheerful
spirits
when
she
shook
hands
with
me
she
looked
sharply
in
my
face
and
said
no
sitting
up
tonight
for
you
you
are
worn
out
i
am
quite
well
again
indeed
i
am
and
if
there
is
to
be
any
sitting
up
it
is
i
who
will
sit
up
with
you
i
would
not
argue
the
point
but
went
and
had
my
supper
lucy
came
with
me
and
enlivened
by
her
charming
presence
i
made
an
excellent
meal
and
had
a
couple
of
glasses
of
the
more
than
excellent
port
then
lucy
took
me
upstairs
and
showed
me
a
room
next
her
own
where
a
cozy
fire
was
burning
now
she
said
you
must
stay
here
i
shall
leave
this
door
open
and
my
door
too
you
can
lie
on
the
sofa
for
i
know
that
nothing
would
induce
any
of
you
doctors
to
go
to
bed
whilst
there
is
a
patient
above
the
horizon
if
i
want
anything
i
shall
call
out
and
you
can
come
to
me
at
once
i
could
not
but
acquiesce
for
i
was
dogtired
and
could
not
have
sat
up
had
i
tried
so
on
her
renewing
her
promise
to
call
me
if
she
should
want
anything
i
lay
on
the
sofa
and
forgot
all
about
everything

feel
so
happy
tonight
i
have
been
so
miserably
weak
that
to
be
able
to
think
and
move
about
is
like
feeling
sunshine
after
a
long
spell
of
east
wind
out
of
a

somehow
arthur

very
very
close
to
me
i
seem
to
feel
his
presence
warm
about
me
i
suppose
it
is
that
sickness
and
weakness
are
selfish
things
and
turn
our
inner
eyes
and
sympathy
on
ourselves
whilst
health
and
strength
give
love
rein
and
in

and

he
can
wander
where
he

knew
my

the
blissful
rest
of
last
night
how
i
slept
with
that
dear
good
dr

watching

i

septemberi
was
conscious
of
the
professors
hand
on
my
head
and
started
awake
all
in
a
second
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
we
learn
in
an
asylum
at
any
rate
and
how
is
our
patient
well
when
i
left
her
or
rather
when
she
left
me
i
answered
come
let
us
see
he
said
and
together
we
went
into
the
room
the
blind
was
down
and
i
went
over
to
raise
it
gently
whilst
van
helsing
stepped
with
his
soft
catlike
tread
over
to
the
bed
as
i
raised
the
blind
and
the
morning
sunlight
flooded
the
room
i
heard
the
professors
low
hiss
of
inspiration
and
knowing
its
rarity
a
deadly
fear
shot
through
my
heart
as
i
passed
over
he
moved
back
and
his
exclamation
of
horror
gott
in
himmel
needed
no
enforcement
from
his
agonised
face
he
raised
his
hand
and
pointed
to
the
bed
and
his
iron
face
was
drawn
and
ashen
white
i
felt
my
knees
begin
to
tremble
there
on
the
bed
seemingly
in
a
swoon
lay
poor
lucy
more
horribly
white
and
wanlooking
than
ever
even
the
lips
were
white
and
the
gums
seemed
to
have
shrunken
back
from
the
teeth
as
we
sometimes
see
in
a
corpse
after
a
prolonged
illness
van
helsing
raised
his
foot
to
stamp
in
anger
but
the
instinct
of
his
life
and
all
the
long
years
of
habit
stood
to
him
and
he
put
it
down
again
softly
quick
he
said
bring
the
brandy
i
flew
to
the
diningroom
and
returned
with
the
decanter
he
wetted
the
poor
white
lips
with
it
and
together
we
rubbed
palm
and
wrist
and
heart
he
felt
her
heart
and
after
a
few
moments
of
agonising
suspense
said
it
is
not
too
late
it
beats
though
but
feebly
all
our
work
is
undone
we
must
begin
again
there
is
no
young
arthur
here
now
i
have
to
call
on
you
yourself
this
time
friend
john
as
he
spoke
he
was
dipping
into
his
bag
and
producing
the
instruments
for
transfusion
i
had
taken
off
my
coat
and
rolled
up
my
shirtsleeve
there
was
no
possibility
of
an
opiate
just
at
present
and
no
need
of
one
and
so
without
a
moments
delay
we
began
the
operation
after
a
timeit
did
not
seem
a
short
time
either
for
the
draining
away
of
ones
blood
no
matter
how
willingly
it
be
given
is
a
terrible
feelingvan
helsing
held
up
a
warning
finger
do
not
stir
he
said
but
i
fear
that
with
growing
strength
she
may
wake
and
that
would
make
danger
oh
so
much
danger
but
i
shall
precaution
take
i
shall
give
hypodermic
injection
of
morphia
he
proceeded
then
swiftly
and
deftly
to
carry
out
his
intent
the
effect
on
lucy
was
not
bad
for
the
faint
seemed
to
merge
subtly
into
the
narcotic
sleep
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
personal
pride
that
i
could
see
a
faint
tinge
of
colour
steal
back
into
the
pallid
cheeks
and
lips
no
man
knows
till
he
experiences
it
what
it
is
to
feel
his
own
lifeblood
drawn
away
into
the
veins
of
the
woman
he
loves
the
professor
watched
me
critically
that
will
do
he
said
already
i
remonstrated
you
took
a
great
deal
more
from
art
to
which
he
smiled
a
sad
sort
of
smile
as
he
replied
he
is
her
lover
her
fianc
you
have
work
much
work
to
do
for
her
and
for
others
and
the
present
will
suffice
when
we
stopped
the
operation
he
attended
to
lucy
whilst
i
applied
digital
pressure
to
my
own
incision
i
laid
down
whilst
i
waited
his
leisure
to
attend
to
me
for
i
felt
faint
and
a
little
sick
byandby
he
bound
up
my
wound
and
sent
me
downstairs
to
get
a
glass
of
wine
for
myself
as
i
was
leaving
the
room
he
came
after
me
and
half
whispered
mind
nothing
must
be
said
of
this
if
our
young
lover
should
turn
up
unexpected
as
before
no
word
to
him
it
would
at
once
frighten
him
and
enjealous
him
too
there
must
be
none
so
when
i
came
back
he
looked
at
me
carefully
and
then
said
you
are
not
much
the
worse
go
into
the
room
and
lie
on
your
sofa
and
rest
awhile
then
have
much
breakfast
and
come
here
to
me
i
followed
out
his
orders
for
i
knew
how
right
and
wise
they
were
i
had
done
my
part
and
now
my
next
duty
was
to
keep
up
my
strength
i
felt
very
weak
and
in
the
weakness
lost
something
of
the
amazement
at
what
had
occurred
i
fell
asleep
on
the
sofa
however
wondering
over
and
over
again
how
lucy
had
made
such
a
retrograde
movement
and
how
she
could
have
been
drained
of
so
much
blood
with
no
sign
anywhere
to
show
for
it
i
think
i
must
have
continued
my
wonder
in
my
dreams
for
sleeping
and
waking
my
thoughts
always
came
back
to
the
little
punctures
in
her
throat
and
the
ragged
exhausted
appearance
of
their
edgestiny
though
they
were
lucy
slept
well
into
the
day
and
when
she
woke
she
was
fairly
well
and
strong
though
not
nearly
so
much
so
as
the
day
before
when
van
helsing
had
seen
her
he
went
out
for
a
walk
leaving
me
in
charge
with
strict
injunctions
that
i
was
not
to
leave
her
for
a
moment
i
could
hear
his
voice
in
the
hall
asking
the
way
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
lucy
chatted
with
me
freely
and
seemed
quite
unconscious
that
anything
had
happened
i
tried
to
keep
her
amused
and
interested
when
her
mother
came
up
to
see
her
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
any
change
whatever
but
said
to
me
gratefully
we
owe
you
so
much
dr
seward
for
all
you
have
done
but
you
really
must
now
take
care
not
to
overwork
yourself
you
are
looking
pale
yourself
you
want
a
wife
to
nurse
and
look
after
you
a
bit
that
you
do
as
she
spoke
lucy
turned
crimson
though
it
was
only
momentarily
for
her
poor
wasted
veins
could
not
stand
for
long
such
an
unwonted
drain
to
the
head
the
reaction
came
in
excessive
pallor
as
she
turned
imploring
eyes
on
me
i
smiled
and
nodded
and
laid
my
finger
on
my
lips
with
a
sigh
she
sank
back
amid
her
pillows
van
helsing
returned
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
presently
said
to
me
now
you
go
home
and
eat
much
and
drink
enough
make
yourself
strong
i
stay
here
tonight
and
i
shall
sit
up
with
little
miss
myself
you
and
i
must
watch
the
case
and
we
must
have
none
other
to
know
i
have
grave
reasons
no
do
not
ask
them
think
what
you
will
do
not
fear
to
think
even
the
most
notprobable
goodnight
in
the
hall
two
of
the
maids
came
to
me
and
asked
if
they
or
either
of
them
might
not
sit
up
with
miss
lucy
they
implored
me
to
let
them
and
when
i
said
it
was
dr
van
helsings
wish
that
either
he
or
i
should
sit
up
they
asked
me
quite
piteously
to
intercede
with
the
foreign
gentleman
i
was
much
touched
by
their
kindness
perhaps
it
is
because
i
am
weak
at
present
and
perhaps
because
it
was
on
lucys
account
that
their
devotion
was
manifested
for
over
and
over
again
have
i
seen
similar
instances
of
womans
kindness
i
got
back
here
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
went
my
roundsall
well
and
set
this
down
whilst
waiting
for
sleep
it
is
coming





11
septemberthis
afternoon
i
went
over
to
hillingham
found
van
helsing
in
excellent
spirits
and
lucy
much
better
shortly
after
i
had
arrived
a
big
parcel
from
abroad
came
for
the
professor
he
opened
it
with
much
impressmentassumed
of
courseand
showed
a
great
bundle
of
white
flowers
these
are
for
you
miss
lucy
he
said
for
me
oh
dr
van
helsing
yes
my
dear
but
not
for
you
to
play
with
these
are
medicines
here
lucy
made
a
wry
face
nay
but
they
are
not
to
take
in
a
decoction
or
in
nauseous
form
so
you
need
not
snub
that
so
charming
nose
or
i
shall
point
out
to
my
friend
arthur
what
woes
he
may
have
to
endure
in
seeing
so
much
beauty
that
he
so
loves
so
much
distort
aha
my
pretty
miss
that
bring
the
so
nice
nose
all
straight
again
this
is
medicinal
but
you
do
not
know
how
i
put
him
in
your
window
i
make
pretty
wreath
and
hang
him
round
your
neck
so
that
you
sleep
well
oh
yes
they
like
the
lotus
flower
make
your
trouble
forgotten
it
smell
so
like
the
waters
of
lethe
and
of
that
fountain
of
youth
that
the
conquistadores
sought
for
in
the
floridas
and
find
him
all
too
late
whilst
he
was
speaking
lucy
had
been
examining
the
flowers
and
smelling
them
now
she
threw
them
down
saying
with
halflaughter
and
halfdisgust
oh
professor
i
believe
you
are
only
putting
up
a
joke
on
me
why
these
flowers
are
only
common
garlic
to
my
surprise
van
helsing
rose
up
and
said
with
all
his
sternness
his
iron
jaw
set
and
his
bushy
eyebrows
meeting
no
trifling
with
me
i
never
jest
there
is
grim
purpose
in
all
i
do
and
i
warn
you
that
you
do
not
thwart
me
take
care
for
the
sake
of
others
if
not
for
your
own
then
seeing
poor
lucy
scared
as
she
might
well
be
he
went
on
more
gently
oh
little
miss
my
dear
do
not
fear
me
i
only
do
for
your
good
but
there
is
much
virtue
to
you
in
those
so
common
flowers
see
i
place
them
myself
in
your
room
i
make
myself
the
wreath
that
you
are
to
wear
but
hush
no
telling
to
others
that
make
so
inquisitive
questions
we
must
obey
and
silence
is
a
part
of
obedience
and
obedience
is
to
bring
you
strong
and
well
into
loving
arms
that
wait
for
you
now
sit
still
awhile
come
with
me
friend
john
and
you
shall
help
me
deck
the
room
with
my
garlic
which
is
all
the
way
from
haarlem
where
my
friend
vanderpool
raise
herb
in
his
glasshouses
all
the
year
i
had
to
telegraph
yesterday
or
they
would
not
have
been
here
we
went
into
the
room
taking
the
flowers
with
us
the
professors
actions
were
certainly
odd
and
not
to
be
found
in
any
pharmacopoeia
that
i
ever
heard
of
first
he
fastened
up
the
windows
and
latched
them
securely
next
taking
a
handful
of
the
flowers
he
rubbed
them
all
over
the
sashes
as
though
to
ensure
that
every
whiff
of
air
that
might
get
in
would
be
laden
with
the
garlic
smell
then
with
the
wisp
he
rubbed
all
over
the
jamb
of
the
door
above
below
and
at
each
side
and
round
the
fireplace
in
the
same
way
it
all
seemed
grotesque
to
me
and
presently
i
said
well
professor
i
know
you
always
have
a
reason
for
what
you
do
but
this
certainly
puzzles
me
it
is
well
we
have
no
sceptic
here
or
he
would
say
that
you
were
working
some
spell
to
keep
out
an
evil
spirit
perhaps
i
am
he
answered
quietly
as
he
began
to
make
the
wreath
which
lucy
was
to
wear
round
her
neck
we
then
waited
whilst
lucy
made
her
toilet
for
the
night
and
when
she
was
in
bed
he
came
and
himself
fixed
the
wreath
of
garlic
round
her
neck
the
last
words
he
said
to
her
were
take
care
you
do
not
disturb
it
and
even
if
the
room
feel
close
do
not
tonight
open
the
window
or
the
door
i
promise
said
lucy
and
thank
you
both
a
thousand
times
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
oh
what
have
i
done
to
be
blessed
with
such
friends
as
we
left
the
house
in
my
fly
which
was
waiting
van
helsing
said
tonight
i
can
sleep
in
peace
and
sleep
i
wanttwo
nights
of
travel
much
reading
in
the
day
between
and
much
anxiety
on
the
day
to
follow
and
a
night
to
sit
up
without
to
wink
tomorrow
in
the
morning
early
you
call
for
me
and
we
come
together
to
see
our
pretty
miss
so
much
more
strong
for
my
spell
which
i
have
work
ho
ho
he
seemed
so
confident
that
i
remembering
my
own
confidence
two
nights
before
and
with
the
baneful
result
felt
awe
and
vague
terror
it
must
have
been
my
weakness
that
made
me
hesitate
to
tell
it
to
my
friend
but
i
felt
it
all
the
more
like
unshed
tears

good
they
all
are
to
me
i
quite
love
that
dear
dr
van
helsing
i
wonder
why
he
was
so
anxious
about
these
flowers
he
positively
frightened
me
he
was
so
fierce
and
yet
he
must
have
been
right
for
i
feel
comfort
from
them
already
somehow
i
do
not
dread
being
alone
tonight
and
i
can
go
to
sleep
without
fear
i
shall
not
mind
any
flapping
outside
the
window
oh
the
terrible
struggle
that
i
have
had
against
sleep
so
often
of
late
the
pain
of
the
sleeplessness
or
the
pain
of
the
fear
of
sleep
with
such
unknown
horrors
as
it
has
for
me
how
blessed
are
some
people
whose
lives
have
no
fears
no
dreads
to
whom
sleep
is
a
blessing
that
comes
nightly
and
brings
nothing
but
sweet
dreams
well
here
i
am
tonight
hoping
for
sleep
and
lying
like
ophelia
in
the
play
with
virgin
crants
and
maiden
strewments
i
never
liked
garlic
before
but
tonight
it
is
delightful
there
is
peace
in
its
smell
i
feel

septembercalled
at
the
berkeley
and
found
van
helsing
as
usual
up
to
time
the
carriage
ordered
from
the
hotel
was
waiting
the
professor
took
his
bag
which
he
always
brings
with
him
now
let
all
be
put
down
exactly
van
helsing
and
i
arrived
at
hillingham
at
eight
oclock
it
was
a
lovely
morning
the
bright
sunshine
and
all
the
fresh
feeling
of
early
autumn
seemed
like
the
completion
of
natures
annual
work
the
leaves
were
turning
to
all
kinds
of
beautiful
colours
but
had
not
yet
begun
to
drop
from
the
trees
when
we
entered
we
met
mrs
westenra
coming
out
of
the
morning
room
she
is
always
an
early
riser
she
greeted
us
warmly
and
said
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
lucy
is
better
the
dear
child
is
still
asleep
i
looked
into
her
room
and
saw
her
but
did
not
go
in
lest
i
should
disturb
her
the
professor
smiled
and
looked
quite
jubilant
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
said
aha
i
thought
i
had
diagnosed
the
case
my
treatment
is
working
to
which
she
answered
you
must
not
take
all
the
credit
to
yourself
doctor
lucys
state
this
morning
is
due
in
part
to
me
how
you
do
mean
maam
asked
the
professor
well
i
was
anxious
about
the
dear
child
in
the
night
and
went
into
her
room
she
was
sleeping
soundlyso
soundly
that
even
my
coming
did
not
wake
her
but
the
room
was
awfully
stuffy
there
were
a
lot
of
those
horrible
strongsmelling
flowers
about
everywhere
and
she
had
actually
a
bunch
of
them
round
her
neck
i
feared
that
the
heavy
odour
would
be
too
much
for
the
dear
child
in
her
weak
state
so
i
took
them
all
away
and
opened
a
bit
of
the
window
to
let
in
a
little
fresh
air
you
will
be
pleased
with
her
i
am
sure
she
moved
off
into
her
boudoir
where
she
usually
breakfasted
early
as
she
had
spoken
i
watched
the
professors
face
and
saw
it
turn
ashen
grey
he
had
been
able
to
retain
his
selfcommand
whilst
the
poor
lady
was
present
for
he
knew
her
state
and
how
mischievous
a
shock
would
be
he
actually
smiled
on
her
as
he
held
open
the
door
for
her
to
pass
into
her
room
but
the
instant
she
had
disappeared
he
pulled
me
suddenly
and
forcibly
into
the
diningroom
and
closed
the
door
then
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
van
helsing
break
down
he
raised
his
hands
over
his
head
in
a
sort
of
mute
despair
and
then
beat
his
palms
together
in
a
helpless
way
finally
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
putting
his
hands
before
his
face
began
to
sob
with
loud
dry
sobs
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
racking
of
his
heart
then
he
raised
his
arms
again
as
though
appealing
to
the
whole
universe
god
god
god
he
said
what
have
we
done
what
has
this
poor
thing
done
that
we
are
so
sore
beset
is
there
fate
amongst
us
still
sent
down
from
the
pagan
world
of
old
that
such
things
must
be
and
in
such
way
this
poor
mother
all
unknowing
and
all
for
the
best
as
she
think
does
such
thing
as
lose
her
daughter
body
and
soul
and
we
must
not
tell
her
we
must
not
even
warn
her
or
she
die
and
then
both
die
oh
how
we
are
beset
how
are
all
the
powers
of
the
devils
against
us
suddenly
he
jumped
to
his
feet
come
he
said
come
we
must
see
and
act
devils
or
no
devils
or
all
the
devils
at
once
it
matters
not
we
fight
him
all
the
same
he
went
to
the
halldoor
for
his
bag
and
together
we
went
up
to
lucys
room
once
again
i
drew
up
the
blind
whilst
van
helsing
went
towards
the
bed
this
time
he
did
not
start
as
he
looked
on
the
poor
face
with
the
same
awful
waxen
pallor
as
before
he
wore
a
look
of
stern
sadness
and
infinite
pity
as
i
expected
he
murmured
with
that
hissing
inspiration
of
his
which
meant
so
much
without
a
word
he
went
and
locked
the
door
and
then
began
to
set
out
on
the
little
table
the
instruments
for
yet
another
operation
of
transfusion
of
blood
i
had
long
ago
recognised
the
necessity
and
begun
to
take
off
my
coat
but
he
stopped
me
with
a
warning
hand
no
he
said
today
you
must
operate
i
shall
provide
you
are
weakened
already
as
he
spoke
he
took
off
his
coat
and
rolled
up
his
shirtsleeve
again
the
operation
again
the
narcotic
again
some
return
of
colour
to
the
ashy
cheeks
and
the
regular
breathing
of
healthy
sleep
this
time
i
watched
whilst
van
helsing
recruited
himself
and
rested
presently
he
took
an
opportunity
of
telling
mrs
westenra
that
she
must
not
remove
anything
from
lucys
room
without
consulting
him
that
the
flowers
were
of
medicinal
value
and
that
the
breathing
of
their
odour
was
a
part
of
the
system
of
cure
then
he
took
over
the
care
of
the
case
himself
saying
that
he
would
watch
this
night
and
the
next
and
would
send
me
word
when
to
come
after
another
hour
lucy
waked
from
her
sleep
fresh
and
bright
and
seemingly
not
much
the
worse
for
her
terrible
ordeal
what
does
it
all
mean
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
if
my
long
habit
of
life
amongst
the
insane
is
beginning
to
tell
upon
my
own
brain

17
septemberfour
days
and
nights
of
peace
i
am
getting
so
strong
again
that
i
hardly
know
myself
it
is
as
if
i
had
passed
through
some
long
nightmare
and
had
just
awakened
to
see
the
beautiful
sunshine
and
feel
the
fresh
air
of
the
morning
around
me
i
have
a
dim
halfremembrance
of
long
anxious
times
of
waiting
and
fearing
darkness
in
which
there
was
not
even
the
pain
of
hope
to
make
present
distress
more
poignant
and
then
long
spells
of
oblivion
and
the
rising
back
to
life
as
a
diver
coming
up
through
a
great
press
of
water
since
however
dr
van
helsing
has
been
with
me
all
this
bad
dreaming
seems
to
have
passed
away
the
noises
that
used
to
frighten
me
out
of
my
witsthe
flapping
against
the
windows
the
distant
voices
which
seemed
so
close
to
me
the
harsh
sounds
that
came
from
i
know
not
where
and
commanded
me
to
do
i
know
not
whathave
all
ceased
i
go
to
bed
now
without
any
fear
of
sleep
i
do
not
even
try
to
keep
awake
i
have
grown
quite
fond
of
the
garlic
and
a
boxful
arrives
for
me
every
day
from
haarlem
tonight
dr
van
helsing
is
going
away
as
he
has
to
be
for
a
day
in
amsterdam
but
i
need
not
be
watched
i
am
well
enough
to
be
left
alone
thank
god
for
mothers
sake
and
dear
arthurs
and
for
all
our
friends
who
have
been
so
kind
i
shall
not
even
feel
the
change
for
last
night
dr
van
helsing
slept
in
his
chair
a
lot
of
the
time
i
found
him
asleep
twice
when
i
awoke
but
i
did
not
fear
to
go
to
sleep
again
although
the
boughs
or
bats
or
something
napped
almost
angrily
against
the
windowpanes

18
september
the
escaped
wolf
perilous
adventure
of
our
interviewer
interview
with
the
keeper
in
the
zological
gardens
after
many
inquiries
and
almost
as
many
refusals
and
perpetually
using
the
words
pall
mall
gazette
as
a
sort
of
talisman
i
managed
to
find
the
keeper
of
the
section
of
the
zological
gardens
in
which
the
wolf
department
is
included
thomas
bilder
lives
in
one
of
the
cottages
in
the
enclosure
behind
the
elephanthouse
and
was
just
sitting
down
to
his
tea
when
i
found
him
thomas
and
his
wife
are
hospitable
folk
elderly
and
without
children
and
if
the
specimen
i
enjoyed
of
their
hospitality
be
of
the
average
kind
their
lives
must
be
pretty
comfortable
the
keeper
would
not
enter
on
what
he
called
business
until
the
supper
was
over
and
we
were
all
satisfied
then
when
the
table
was
cleared
and
he
had
lit
his
pipe
he
said
now

and
with
that

away
old
bersicker
kep
alookin
arter
im
till
e
was
out
of
sight
and
then
went
and
lay
down
in
a
corner
and
wouldnt
come
hout
the
ole
hevening
well
larst
night
so
soon
as
the
moon
was
hup
the
wolves
here
all
began
aowling
there
warnt
nothing
for
them
to
owl
at
there
warnt
no
one
near
except
some
one
that
was
evidently
acallin
a
dog
somewheres
out
back
of
the
gardings
in
the
park
road
once
or
twice
i
went
out
to
see
that
all
was
right
and
it
was
and
then
the
owling
stopped
just
before
twelve
oclock
i
just
took
a
look
round
afore
turnin
in
an
bust
me
but
when
i
kem
opposite
to
old
bersickers
cage
i
see
the
rails
broken
and
twisted
about
and
the
cage
empty
and
thats
all
i
know
for
certing
did
any
one
else
see
anything
one
of
our
gardners
was
acomin
ome
about
that
time
from
a
armony
when
he
sees
a
big
grey
dog
comin
out
through
the
garding
edges
at
least
so
he
says
but
i
dont
give
much
for
it
myself
for
if
he
did
e
never
said
a
word
about
it
to
his
missis
when
e
got
ome
and
it
was
only
after
the
escape
of
the
wolf
was
made
known
and
we
had
been
up
all
nightahuntin
of
the
park
for
bersicker
that
he
remembered
seein
anything
my
own
belief
was
that
the
armony
ad
got
into
his
ead
now
mr
bilder
can
you
account
in
any
way
for
the
escape
of
the
wolf
well
sir
he
said
with
a
suspicious
sort
of
modesty
i
think
i
can
but
i
dont
know
as
ow
youd
be
satisfied
with
the
theory
certainly
i
shall
if
a
man
like
you
who
knows
the
animals
from
experience
cant
hazard
a
good
guess
at
any
rate
who
is
even
to
try
well
then
sir
i
accounts
for
it
this
way
it
seems
to
me
that
ere
wolf
escapedsimply
because
he
wanted
to
get
out
from
the
hearty
way
that
both
thomas
and
his
wife
laughed
at
the
joke
i
could
see
that
it
had
done
service
before
and
that
the
whole
explanation
was
simply
an
elaborate
sell
i
couldnt
cope
in
badinage
with
the
worthy
thomas
but
i
thought
i
knew
a
surer
way
to
his
heart
so
i
said
now
mr
bilder
well
consider
that
first
halfsovereign
worked
off
and
this
brother
of
his
is
waiting
to
be
claimed
when
youve
told
me
what
you
think
will
happen
right
yare
sir
he
said
briskly
yell
excoose
me
i
know
for
achaffin
of
ye
but
the
old
woman
here
winked
at
me
which
was
as
much
as
telling
me
to
go
on
well
i
never
said
the
old
lady
my
opinion
is
this
that
ere
wolf
is
aidin
of
somewheres
the
gardner
wot
didnt
remember
said
he
was
agallopin
northward
faster
than
a
horse
could
go
but
i
dont
believe
him
for
yer
see
sir
wolves
dont
gallop
no
more
nor
dogs
does
they
not
bein
built
that
way
wolves
is
fine
things
in
a
storybook
and
i
dessay
when
they
gets
in
packs
and
does
be
chivyin
somethin
thats
more
afeared
than
they
is
they
can
make
a
devil
of
a
noise
and
chop
it
up
whatever
it
is
but
lor
bless
you
in
real
life
a
wolf
is
only
a
low
creature
not
half
so
clever
or
bold
as
a
good
dog
and
not
half
a
quarter
so
much
fight
in
im
this
one
aint
been
used
to
fightin
or
even
to
providin
for
hisself
and
more
like
hes
somewhere
round
the
park
aidin
an
ashiverin
of
and
if
he
thinks
at
all
wonderin
where
he
is
to
get
his
breakfast
from
or
maybe
hes
got
down
some
area
and
is
in
a
coalcellar
my
eye
wont
some
cook
get
a
rum
start
when
she
sees
his
green
eyes
ashining
at
her
out
of
the
dark
if
he
cant
get
food
hes
bound
to
look
for
it
and
mayhap
he
may
chance
to
light
on
a
butchers
shop
in
time
if
he
doesnt
and
some
nursemaid
goes
awalkin
orf
with
a
soldier
leavin
of
the
hinfant
in
the
perambulatorwell
then
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
if
the
census
is
one
babby
the
less
thats
all
i
was
handing
him
the
halfsovereign
when
something
came
bobbing
up
against
the
window
and
mr
bilders
face
doubled
its
natural
length
with
surprise
god
bless
me
he
said
if
there
aint
old
bersicker
come
back
by
isself
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
most
unnecessary
proceeding
it
seemed
to
me
i
have
always
thought
that
a
wild
animal
never
looks
so
well
as
when
some
obstacle
of
pronounced
durability
is
between
us
a
personal
experience
has
intensified
rather
than
diminished
that
idea
after
all
however
there
is
nothing
like
custom
for
neither
bilder
nor
his
wife
thought
any
more
of
the
wolf
than
i
should
of
a
dog
the
animal
itself
was
as
peaceful
and
wellbehaved
as
that
father
of
all
picturewolvesred
riding
hoods
quondam
friend
whilst
moving
her
confidence
in
masquerade
the
whole
scene
was
an
unutterable
mixture
of
comedy
and
pathos
the
wicked
wolf
that
for
half
a
day
had
paralysed
london
and
set
all
the
children
in
the
town
shivering
in
their
shoes
was
there
in
a
sort
of
penitent
mood
and
was
received
and
petted
like
a
sort
of
vulpine
prodigal
son
old
bilder
examined
him
all
over
with
most
tender
solicitude
and
when
he
had
finished
with
his
penitent
said
there
i
knew
the
poor
old
chap
would
get
into
some
kind
of
trouble
didnt
i
say
it
all
along

with
broken
bottles
this

what

bersicker
he
took
the
wolf
and
locked
him
up
in
a
cage
with
a
piece
of
meat
that
satisfied
in
quantity
at
any
rate
the
elementary
conditions
of
the
fatted
calf

went
off

came
off

to

the
only

septemberi
was
engaged
after
dinner
in
my
study
posting
up
my
books
which
through
press
of
other
work
and
the
many
visits
to
lucy
had
fallen
sadly
into
arrear
suddenly
the
door
was
burst
open
and
in
rushed
my
patient
with
his
face
distorted
with
passion
i
was
thunderstruck
for
such
a
thing
as
a
patient
getting
of
his
own
accord
into
the
superintendents
study
is
almost
unknown
without
an
instants
pause
he
made
straight
at
me
he
had
a
dinnerknife
in
his
hand
and
as
i
saw
he
was
dangerous
i
tried
to
keep
the
table
between
us
he
was
too
quick
and
too
strong
for
me
however
for
before
i
could
get
my
balance
he
had
struck
at
me
and
cut
my
left
wrist
rather
severely
before
he
could
strike
again
however
i
got
in
my
right
and
he
was
sprawling
on
his
back
on
the
floor
my
wrist
bled
freely
and
quite
a
little
pool
trickled
on
to
the
carpet
i
saw
that
my
friend
was
not
intent
on
further
effort
and
occupied
myself
binding
up
my
wrist
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
the
prostrate
figure
all
the
time
when
the
attendants
rushed
in
and
we
turned
our
attention
to
him
his
employment
positively
sickened
me
he
was
lying
on
his
belly
on
the
floor
licking
up
like
a
dog
the
blood
which
had
fallen
from
my
wounded
wrist
he
was
easily
secured
and
to
my
surprise
went
with
the
attendants
quite
placidly
simply
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
blood
is
the
life
the
blood
is
the
life
i
cannot
afford
to
lose
blood
just
at
present
i
have
lost
too
much
of
late
for
my
physical
good
and
then
the
prolonged
strain
of
lucys
illness
and
its
horrible
phases
is
telling
on
me
i
am
overexcited
and

18
septemberjust
off
for
train
to
london
the
arrival
of
van
helsings
telegram
filled
me
with
dismay
a
whole
night
lost
and
i
know
by
bitter
experience
what
may
happen
in
a
night
of
course
it
is
possible
that
all
may
be
well
but
what
may
have
happened
surely
there
is
some
horrible
doom
hanging
over
us
that
every
possible
accident
should
thwart
us
in
all
we
try
to
do
i
shall
take

write
this
and
leave
it
to
be
seen
so
that
no
one
may
by
any
chance
get
into
trouble
through
me
this
is
an
exact
record
of
what
took
place
tonight
i
feel
i
am
dying
of
weakness
and
have
barely
strength
to
write
but
it
must
be
done
if
i
die
in
the
doing
i
went
to
bed
as
usual
taking
care
that
the
flowers
were
placed
as
dr
van
helsing
directed
and
soon
fell
asleep
i
was
waked
by
the
flapping
at
the
window
which
had
begun
after
that
sleepwalking
on
the
cliff
at
whitby
when
mina
saved
me
and
which
now
i
know
so
well
i
was
not
afraid
but
i
did
wish
that
dr
seward
was
in
the
next
roomas
dr
van
helsing
said
he
would
beso
that
i
might
have
called
him
i
tried
to
go
to
sleep
but
could
not
then
there
came
to
me
the
old
fear
of
sleep
and
i
determined
to
keep
awake
perversely
sleep
would
try
to
come
then
when
i
did
not
want
it
so
as
i
feared
to
be
alone
i
opened
my
door
and
called
out
is
there
anybody
there
there
was
no
answer
i
was
afraid
to
wake
mother
and
so
closed
my
door
again
then
outside
in
the
shrubbery
i
heard
a
sort
of
howl
like
a
dogs
but
more
fierce
and
deeper
i
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
but
could
see
nothing
except
a
big
bat
which
had
evidently
been
buffeting
its
wings
against
the
window
so
i
went
back
to
bed
again
but
determined
not
to
go
to
sleep
presently
the
door
opened
and
mother
looked
in
seeing
by
my
moving
that
i
was
not
asleep
came
in
and
sat
by
me
she
said
to
me
even
more
sweetly
and
softly
than
her
wont
i
was
uneasy
about
you
darling
and
came
in
to
see
that
you
were
all
right
i
feared
she
might
catch
cold
sitting
there
and
asked
her
to
come
in
and
sleep
with
me
so
she
came
into
bed
and
lay
down
beside
me
she
did
not
take
off
her
dressing
gown
for
she
said
she
would
only
stay
a
while
and
then
go
back
to
her
own
bed
as
she
lay
there
in
my
arms
and
i
in
hers
the
flapping
and
buffeting
came
to
the
window
again
she
was
startled
and
a
little
frightened
and
cried
out
what
is
that
i
tried
to
pacify
her
and
at
last
succeeded
and
she
lay
quiet
but
i
could
hear
her
poor
dear
heart
still
beating
terribly
after
a
while
there
was
the
low
howl
again
out
in
the
shrubbery
and
shortly
after
there
was
a
crash
at
the
window
and
a
lot
of
broken
glass
was
hurled
on
the
floor
the
window
blind
blew
back
with
the
wind
that
rushed
in
and
in
the
aperture
of
the
broken
panes
there
was
the
head
of
a
great
gaunt
grey
wolf
mother
cried
out
in
a
fright
and
struggled
up
into
a
sitting
posture
and
clutched
wildly
at
anything
that
would
help
her
amongst
other
things
she
clutched
the
wreath
of
flowers
that
dr
van
helsing
insisted
on
my
wearing
round
my
neck
and
tore
it
away
from
me
for
a
second
or
two
she
sat
up
pointing
at
the
wolf
and
there
was
a
strange
and
horrible
gurgling
in
her
throat
then
she
fell
overas
if
struck
with
lightning
and
her
head
hit
my
forehead
and
made
me
dizzy
for
a
moment
or
two
the
room
and
all
round
seemed
to
spin
round
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
but
the
wolf
drew
his
head
back
and
a
whole
myriad
of
little
specks
seemed
to
come
blowing
in
through
the
broken
window
and
wheeling
and
circling
round
like
the
pillar
of
dust
that
travellers
describe
when
there
is
a
simoon
in
the
desert
i
tried
to
stir
but
there
was
some
spell
upon
me
and
dear
mothers
poor
body
which
seemed
to
grow
cold
alreadyfor
her
dear
heart
had
ceased
to
beatweighed
me
down
and
i
remembered
no
more
for
a
while
the
time
did
not
seem
long
but
very
very
awful
till
i
recovered
consciousness
again
somewhere
near
a
passing
bell
was
tolling
the
dogs
all
round
the
neighbourhood
were
howling
and
in
our
shrubbery
seemingly
just
outside
a
nightingale
was
singing
i
was
dazed
and
stupid
with
pain
and
terror
and
weakness
but
the
sound
of
the
nightingale
seemed
like
the
voice
of
my
dead
mother
come
back
to
comfort
me
the
sounds
seemed
to
have
awakened
the
maids
too
for
i
could
hear
their
bare
feet
pattering
outside
my
door
i
called
to
them
and
they
came
in
and
when
they
saw
what
had
happened
and
what
it
was
that
lay
over
me
on
the
bed
they
screamed
out
the
wind
rushed
in
through
the
broken
window
and
the
door
slammed
to
they
lifted
off
the
body
of
my
dear
mother
and
laid
her
covered
up
with
a
sheet
on
the
bed
after
i
had
got
up
they
were
all
so
frightened
and
nervous
that
i
directed
them
to
go
to
the
diningroom
and
have
each
a
glass
of
wine
the
door
flew
open
for
an
instant
and
closed
again
the
maids
shrieked
and
then
went
in
a
body
to
the
diningroom
and
i
laid
what
flowers
i
had
on
my
dear
mothers
breast
when
they
were
there
i
remembered
what
dr
van
helsing
had
told
me
but
i
didnt
like
to
remove
them
and
besides
i
would
have
some
of
the
servants
to
sit
up
with
me
now
i
was
surprised
that
the
maids
did
not
come
back
i
called
them
but
got
no
answer
so
i
went
to
the
diningroom
to
look
for
them
my
heart
sank
when
i
saw
what
had
happened
they
all
four
lay
helpless
on
the
floor
breathing
heavily
the
decanter
of
sherry
was
on
the
table
half
full
but
there
was
a
queer
acrid
smell
about
i
was
suspicious
and
examined
the
decanter
it
smelt
of
laudanum
and
looking
on
the
sideboard
i
found
that
the
bottle
which
mothers
doctor
uses
for
heroh
did
usewas
empty
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
do
i
am
back
in
the
room
with
mother
i
cannot
leave
her
and
i
am
alone
save
for
the
sleeping
servants
whom
some
one
has
drugged
alone
with
the
dead
i
dare
not
go
out
for
i
can
hear
the
low
howl
of
the
wolf
through
the
broken
window
the
air
seems
full
of
specks
floating
and
circling
in
the
draught
from
the
window
and
the
lights
burn
blue
and
dim
what
am
i
to
do
god
shield
me
from
harm
this
night
i
shall
hide
this
paper
in
my
breast
where
they
shall
find
it
when
they
come
to
lay
me
out
my
dear
mother
gone
it
is
time
that
i
go
too
goodbye
dear
arthur
if
i
should
not
survive
this
night
god
keep
you
dear
and

diary
18
septemberi
drove
at
once
to
hillingham
and
arrived
early
keeping
my
cab
at
the
gate
i
went
up
the
avenue
alone
i
knocked
gently
and
rang
as
quietly
as
possible
for
i
feared
to
disturb
lucy
or
her
mother
and
hoped
to
only
bring
a
servant
to
the
door
after
a
while
finding
no
response
i
knocked
and
rang
again
still
no
answer
i
cursed
the
laziness
of
the
servants
that
they
should
lie
abed
at
such
an
hourfor
it
was
now
ten
oclockand
so
rang
and
knocked
again
but
more
impatiently
but
still
without
response
hitherto
i
had
blamed
only
the
servants
but
now
a
terrible
fear
began
to
assail
me
was
this
desolation
but
another
link
in
the
chain
of
doom
which
seemed
drawing
tight
around
us
was
it
indeed
a
house
of
death
to
which
i
had
come
too
late
i
knew
that
minutes
even
seconds
of
delay
might
mean
hours
of
danger
to
lucy
if
she
had
had
again
one
of
those
frightful
relapses
and
i
went
round
the
house
to
try
if
i
could
find
by
chance
an
entry
anywhere
i
could
find
no
means
of
ingress
every
window
and
door
was
fastened
and
locked
and
i
returned
baffled
to
the
porch
as
i
did
so
i
heard
the
rapid
pitpat
of
a
swiftly
driven
horses
feet
they
stopped
at
the
gate
and
a
few
seconds
later
i
met
van
helsing
running
up
the
avenue
when
he
saw
me
he
gasped
out
then
it
was
you
and
just
arrived
how
is
she
are
we
too
late
did
you
not
get
my
telegram
i
answered
as
quickly
and
coherently
as
i
could
that
i
had
only
got
his
telegram
early
in
the
morning
and
had
not
lost
a
minute
in
coming
here
and
that
i
could
not
make
any
one
in
the
house
hear
me
he
paused
and
raised
his
hat
as
he
said
solemnly
then
i
fear
we
are
too
late
gods
will
be
done
with
his
usual
recuperative
energy
he
went
on
come
if
there
be
no
way
open
to
get
in
we
must
make
one
time
is
all
in
all
to
us
now
we
went
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
there
was
a
kitchen
window
the
professor
took
a
small
surgical
saw
from
his
case
and
handing
it
to
me
pointed
to
the
iron
bars
which
guarded
the
window
i
attacked
them
at
once
and
had
very
soon
cut
through
three
of
them
then
with
a
long
thin
knife
we
pushed
back
the
fastening
of
the
sashes
and
opened
the
window
i
helped
the
professor
in
and
followed
him
there
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
or
in
the
servants
rooms
which
were
close
at
hand
we
tried
all
the
rooms
as
we
went
along
and
in
the
diningroom
dimly
lit
by
rays
of
light
through
the
shutters
found
four
servantwomen
lying
on
the
floor
there
was
no
need
to
think
them
dead
for
their
stertorous
breathing
and
the
acrid
smell
of
laudanum
in
the
room
left
no
doubt
as
to
their
condition
van
helsing
and
i
looked
at
each
other
and
as
we
moved
away
he
said
we
can
attend
to
them
later
then
we
ascended
to
lucys
room
for
an
instant
or
two
we
paused
at
the
door
to
listen
but
there
was
no
sound
that
we
could
hear
with
white
faces
and
trembling
hands
we
opened
the
door
gently
and
entered
the
room
how
shall
i
describe
what
we
saw
on
the
bed
lay
two
women
lucy
and
her
mother
the
latter
lay
farthest
in
and
she
was
covered
with
a
white
sheet
the
edge
of
which
had
been
blown
back
by
the
draught
through
the
broken
window
showing
the
drawn
white
face
with
a
look
of
terror
fixed
upon
it
by
her
side
lay
lucy
with
face
white
and
still
more
drawn
the
flowers
which
had
been
round
her
neck
we
found
upon
her
mothers
bosom
and
her
throat
was
bare
showing
the
two
little
wounds
which
we
had
noticed
before
but
looking
horribly
white
and
mangled
without
a
word
the
professor
bent
over
the
bed
his
head
almost
touching
poor
lucys
breast
then
he
gave
a
quick
turn
of
his
head
as
of
one
who
listens
and
leaping
to
his
feet
he
cried
out
to
me
it
is
not
yet
too
late
quick
quick
bring
the
brandy
i
flew
downstairs
and
returned
with
it
taking
care
to
smell
and
taste
it
lest
it
too
were
drugged
like
the
decanter
of
sherry
which
i
found
on
the
table
the
maids
were
still
breathing
but
more
restlessly
and
i
fancied
that
the
narcotic
was
wearing
off
i
did
not
stay
to
make
sure
but
returned
to
van
helsing
he
rubbed
the
brandy
as
on
another
occasion
on
her
lips
and
gums
and
on
her
wrists
and
the
palms
of
her
hands
he
said
to
me
i
can
do
this
all
that
can
be
at
the
present
you
go
wake
those
maids
flick
them
in
the
face
with
a
wet
towel
and
flick
them
hard
make
them
get
heat
and
fire
and
a
warm
bath
this
poor
soul
is
nearly
as
cold
as
that
beside
her
she
will
need
be
heated
before
we
can
do
anything
more
i
went
at
once
and
found
little
difficulty
in
waking
three
of
the
women
the
fourth
was
only
a
young
girl
and
the
drug
had
evidently
affected
her
more
strongly
so
i
lifted
her
on
the
sofa
and
let
her
sleep
the
others
were
dazed
at
first
but
as
remembrance
came
back
to
them
they
cried
and
sobbed
in
a
hysterical
manner
i
was
stern
with
them
however
and
would
not
let
them
talk
i
told
them
that
one
life
was
bad
enough
to
lose
and
that
if
they
delayed
they
would
sacrifice
miss
lucy
so
sobbing
and
crying
they
went
about
their
way
half
clad
as
they
were
and
prepared
fire
and
water
fortunately
the
kitchen
and
boiler
fires
were
still
alive
and
there
was
no
lack
of
hot
water
we
got
a
bath
and
carried
lucy
out
as
she
was
and
placed
her
in
it
whilst
we
were
busy
chafing
her
limbs
there
was
a
knock
at
the
hall
door
one
of
the
maids
ran
off
hurried
on
some
more
clothes
and
opened
it
then
she
returned
and
whispered
to
us
that
there
was
a
gentleman
who
had
come
with
a
message
from
mr
holmwood
i
bade
her
simply
tell
him
that
he
must
wait
for
we
could
see
no
one
now
she
went
away
with
the
message
and
engrossed
with
our
work
i
clean
forgot
all
about
him
i
never
saw
in
all
my
experience
the
professor
work
in
such
deadly
earnest
i
knewas
he
knewthat
it
was
a
standup
fight
with
death
and
in
a
pause
told
him
so
he
answered
me
in
a
way
that
i
did
not
understand
but
with
the
sternest
look
that
his
face
could
wear
if
that
were
all
i
would
stop
here
where
we
are
now
and
let
her
fade
away
into
peace
for
i
see
no
light
in
life
over
her
horizon
he
went
on
with
his
work
with
if
possible
renewed
and
more
frenzied
vigour
presently
we
both
began
to
be
conscious
that
the
heat
was
beginning
to
be
of
some
effect
lucys
heart
beat
a
trifle
more
audibly
to
the
stethoscope
and
her
lungs
had
a
perceptible
movement
van
helsings
face
almost
beamed
and
as
we
lifted
her
from
the
bath
and
rolled
her
in
a
hot
sheet
to
dry
her
he
said
to
me
the
first
gain
is
ours
check
to
the
king
we
took
lucy
into
another
room
which
had
by
now
been
prepared
and
laid
her
in
bed
and
forced
a
few
drops
of
brandy
down
her
throat
i
noticed
that
van
helsing
tied
a
soft
silk
handkerchief
round
her
throat
she
was
still
unconscious
and
was
quite
as
bad
as
if
not
worse
than
we
had
ever
seen
her
van
helsing
called
in
one
of
the
women
and
told
her
to
stay
with
her
and
not
to
take
her
eyes
off
her
till
we
returned
and
then
beckoned
me
out
of
the
room
we
must
consult
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
he
said
as
we
descended
the
stairs
in
the
hall
he
opened
the
diningroom
door
and
we
passed
in
he
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
the
shutters
had
been
opened
but
the
blinds
were
already
down
with
that
obedience
to
the
etiquette
of
death
which
the
british
woman
of
the
lower
classes
always
rigidly
observes
the
room
was
therefore
dimly
dark
it
was
however
light
enough
for
our
purposes
van
helsings
sternness
was
somewhat
relieved
by
a
look
of
perplexity
he
was
evidently
torturing
his
mind
about
something
so
i
waited
for
an
instant
and
he
spoke
what
are
we
to
do
now
where
are
we
to
turn
for
help
we
must
have
another
transfusion
of
blood
and
that
soon
or
that
poor
girls
life
wont
be
worth
an
hours
purchase
you
are
exhausted
already
i
am
exhausted
too
i
fear
to
trust
those
women
even
if
they
would
have
courage
to
submit
what
are
we
to
do
for
some
one
who
will
open
his
veins
for
her
whats
the
matter
with
me
anyhow
the
voice
came
from
the
sofa
across
the
room
and
its
tones
brought
relief
and
joy
to
my
heart
for
they
were
those
of
quincey
morris
van
helsing
started
angrily
at
the
first
sound
but
his
face
softened
and
a
glad
look
came
into
his
eyes
as
i
cried
out
quincey
morris
and
rushed
towards
him
with
outstretched
hands
what
brought
you
here
i
cried
as
our
hands
met
i
guess
art
is
the
cause
he
handed
me
a
telegram
have
not
heard
from
seward
for
three
days
and
am
terribly
anxious
cannot
leave
father
still
in
same
condition
send
me
word
how
lucy
is
do
not
delayholmwood
i
think
i
came
just
in
the
nick
of
time
you
know
you
have
only
to
tell
me
what
to
do
van
helsing
strode
forward
and
took
his
hand
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
as
he
said
a
brave
mans
blood
is
the
best
thing
on
this
earth
when
a
woman
is
in
trouble
youre
a
man
and
no
mistake
well
the
devil
may
work
against
us
for
all
hes
worth
but
god
sends
us
men
when
we
want
them
once
again
we
went
through
that
ghastly
operation
i
have
not
the
heart
to
go
through
with
the
details
lucy
had
got
a
terrible
shock
and
it
told
on
her
more
than
before
for
though
plenty
of
blood
went
into
her
veins
her
body
did
not
respond
to
the
treatment
as
well
as
on
the
other
occasions
her
struggle
back
into
life
was
something
frightful
to
see
and
hear
however
the
action
of
both
heart
and
lungs
improved
and
van
helsing
made
a
subcutaneous
injection
of
morphia
as
before
and
with
good
effect
her
faint
became
a
profound
slumber
the
professor
watched
whilst
i
went
downstairs
with
quincey
morris
and
sent
one
of
the
maids
to
pay
off
one
of
the
cabmen
who
were
waiting
i
left
quincey
lying
down
after
having
a
glass
of
wine
and
told
the
cook
to
get
ready
a
good
breakfast
then
a
thought
struck
me
and
i
went
back
to
the
room
where
lucy
now
was
when
i
came
softly
in
i
found
van
helsing
with
a
sheet
or
two
of
notepaper
in
his
hand
he
had
evidently
read
it
and
was
thinking
it
over
as
he
sat
with
his
hand
to
his
brow
there
was
a
look
of
grim
satisfaction
in
his
face
as
of
one
who
has
had
a
doubt
solved
he
handed
me
the
paper
saying
only
it
dropped
from
lucys
breast
when
we
carried
her
to
the
bath
when
i
had
read
it
i
stood
looking
at
the
professor
and
after
a
pause
asked
him
in
gods
name
what
does
it
all
mean
was
she
or
is
she
mad
or
what
sort
of
horrible
danger
is
it
i
was
so
bewildered
that
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
more
van
helsing
put
out
his
hand
and
took
the
paper
saying
do
not
trouble
about
it
now
forget
it
for
the
present
you
shall
know
and
understand
it
all
in
good
time
but
it
will
be
later
and
now
what
is
it
that
you
came
to
me
to
say
this
brought
me
back
to
fact
and
i
was
all
myself
again
i
came
to
speak
about
the
certificate
of
death
if
we
do
not
act
properly
and
wisely
there
may
be
an
inquest
and
that
paper
would
have
to
be
produced
i
am
in
hopes
that
we
need
have
no
inquest
for
if
we
had
it
would
surely
kill
poor
lucy
if
nothing
else
did
i
know
and
you
know
and
the
other
doctor
who
attended
her
knows
that
mrs
westenra
had
disease
of
the
heart
and
we
can
certify
that
she
died
of
it
let
us
fill
up
the
certificate
at
once
and
i
shall
take
it
myself
to
the
registrar
and
go
on
to
the
undertaker
good
oh
my
friend
john
well
thought
of
truly
miss
lucy
if
she
be
sad
in
the
foes
that
beset
her
is
at
least
happy
in
the
friends
that
love
her
one
two
three
all
open
their
veins
for
her
besides
one
old
man
ah
yes
i
know
friend
john
i
am
not
blind
i
love
you
all
the
more
for
it
now
go
in
the
hall
i
met
quincey
morris
with
a
telegram
for
arthur
telling
him
that
mrs
westenra
was
dead
that
lucy
also
had
been
ill
but
was
now
going
on
better
and
that
van
helsing
and
i
were
with
her
i
told
him
where
i
was
going
and
he
hurried
me
out
but
as
i
was
going
said
when
you
come
back
jack
may
i
have
two
words
with
you
all
to
ourselves
i
nodded
in
reply
and
went
out
i
found
no
difficulty
about
the
registration
and
arranged
with
the
local
undertaker
to
come
up
in
the
evening
to
measure
for
the
coffin
and
to
make
arrangements
when
i
got
back
quincey
was
waiting
for
me
i
told
him
i
would
see
him
as
soon
as
i
knew
about
lucy
and
went
up
to
her
room
she
was
still
sleeping
and
the
professor
seemingly
had
not
moved
from
his
seat
at
her
side
from
his
putting
his
finger
to
his
lips
i
gathered
that
he
expected
her
to
wake
before
long
and
was
afraid
of
forestalling
nature
so
i
went
down
to
quincey
and
took
him
into
the
breakfastroom
where
the
blinds
were
not
drawn
down
and
which
was
a
little
more
cheerful
or
rather
less
cheerless
than
the
other
rooms
when
we
were
alone
he
said
to
me
jack
seward
i
dont
want
to
shove
myself
in
anywhere
where
ive
no
right
to
be
but
this
is
no
ordinary
case
you
know
i
loved
that
girl
and
wanted
to
marry
her
but
although
thats
all
past
and
gone
i
cant
help
feeling
anxious
about
her
all
the
same
what
is
it
thats
wrong
with
her
the
dutchmanand
a
fine
old
fellow
he
is
i
can
see
thatsaid
that
time
you
two
came
into
the
room
that
you
must
have
another
transfusion
of
blood
and
that
both
you
and
he
were
exhausted
now
i
know
well
that
you
medical
men
speak
in
camera
and
that
a
man
must
not
expect
to
know
what
they
consult
about
in
private
but
this
is
no
common
matter
and
whatever
it
is
i
have
done
my
part
is
not
that
so
thats
so
i
said
and
he
went
on
i
take
it
that
both
you
and
van
helsing
had
done
already
what
i
did
today
is
not
that
so
thats
so
and
i
guess
art
was
in
it
too
when
i
saw
him
four
days
ago
down
at
his
own
place
he
looked
queer
i
have
not
seen
anything
pulled
down
so
quick
since
i
was
on
the
pampas
and
had
a
mare
that
i
was
fond
of
go
to
grass
all
in
a
night
one
of
those
big
bats
that
they
call
vampires
had
got
at
her
in
the
night
and
what
with
his
gorge
and
the
vein
left
open
there
wasnt
enough
blood
in
her
to
let
her
stand
up
and
i
had
to
put
a
bullet
through
her
as
she
lay
jack
if
you
may
tell
me
without
betraying
confidence
arthur
was
the
first
is
not
that
so
as
he
spoke
the
poor
fellow
looked
terribly
anxious
he
was
in
a
torture
of
suspense
regarding
the
woman
he
loved
and
his
utter
ignorance
of
the
terrible
mystery
which
seemed
to
surround
her
intensified
his
pain
his
very
heart
was
bleeding
and
it
took
all
the
manhood
of
himand
there
was
a
royal
lot
of
it
tooto
keep
him
from
breaking
down
i
paused
before
answering
for
i
felt
that
i
must
not
betray
anything
which
the
professor
wished
kept
secret
but
already
he
knew
so
much
and
guessed
so
much
that
there
could
be
no
reason
for
not
answering
so
i
answered
in
the
same
phrase
thats
so
and
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
about
ten
days
ten
days
then
i
guess
jack
seward
that
that
poor
pretty
creature
that
we
all
love
has
had
put
into
her
veins
within
that
time
the
blood
of
four
strong
men
man
alive
her
whole
body
wouldnt
hold
it
then
coming
close
to
me
he
spoke
in
a
fierce
halfwhisper
what
took
it
out
i
shook
my
head
that
i
said
is
the
crux
van
helsing
is
simply
frantic
about
it
and
i
am
at
my
wits
end
i
cant
even
hazard
a
guess
there
has
been
a
series
of
little
circumstances
which
have
thrown
out
all
our
calculations
as
to
lucy
being
properly
watched
but
these
shall
not
occur
again
here
we
stay
until
all
be
wellor
ill
quincey
held
out
his
hand
count
me
in
he
said
you
and
the
dutchman
will
tell
me
what
to
do
and
ill
do
it
when
she
woke
late
in
the
afternoon
lucys
first
movement
was
to
feel
in
her
breast
and
to
my
surprise
produced
the
paper
which
van
helsing
had
given
me
to
read
the
careful
professor
had
replaced
it
where
it
had
come
from
lest
on
waking
she
should
be
alarmed
her
eye
then
lit
on
van
helsing
and
on
me
too
and
gladdened
then
she
looked
around
the
room
and
seeing
where
she
was
shuddered
she
gave
a
loud
cry
and
put
her
poor
thin
hands
before
her
pale
face
we
both
understood
what
that
meantthat
she
had
realised
to
the
full
her
mothers
death
so
we
tried
what
we
could
to
comfort
her
doubtless
sympathy
eased
her
somewhat
but
she
was
very
low
in
thought
and
spirit
and
wept
silently
and
weakly
for
a
long
time
we
told
her
that
either
or
both
of
us
would
now
remain
with
her
all
the
time
and
that
seemed
to
comfort
her
towards
dusk
she
fell
into
a
doze
here
a
very
odd
thing
occurred
whilst
still
asleep
she
took
the
paper
from
her
breast
and
tore
it
in
two
van
helsing
stepped
over
and
took
the
pieces
from
her
all
the
same
however
she
went
on
with
the
action
of
tearing
as
though
the
material
were
still
in
her
hands
finally
she
lifted
her
hands
and
opened
them
as
though
scattering
the
fragments
van
helsing
seemed
surprised
and
his
brows
gathered
as
if
in
thought
but
he
said
nothing





19
septemberall
last
night
she
slept
fitfully
being
always
afraid
to
sleep
and
something
weaker
when
she
woke
from
it
the
professor
and
i
took
it
in
turns
to
watch
and
we
never
left
her
for
a
moment
unattended
quincey
morris
said
nothing
about
his
intention
but
i
knew
that
all
night
long
he
patrolled
round
and
round
the
house
when
the
day
came
its
searching
light
showed
the
ravages
in
poor
lucys
strength
she
was
hardly
able
to
turn
her
head
and
the
little
nourishment
which
she
could
take
seemed
to
do
her
no
good
at
times
she
slept
and
both
van
helsing
and
i
noticed
the
difference
in
her
between
sleeping
and
waking
whilst
asleep
she
looked
stronger
although
more
haggard
and
her
breathing
was
softer
her
open
mouth
showed
the
pale
gums
drawn
back
from
the
teeth
which
thus
looked
positively
longer
and
sharper
than
usual
when
she
woke
the
softness
of
her
eyes
evidently
changed
the
expression
for
she
looked
her
own
self
although
a
dying
one
in
the
afternoon
she
asked
for
arthur
and
we
telegraphed
for
him
quincey
went
off
to
meet
him
at
the
station
when
he
arrived
it
was
nearly
six
oclock
and
the
sun
was
setting
full
and
warm
and
the
red
light
streamed
in
through
the
window
and
gave
more
colour
to
the
pale
cheeks
when
he
saw
her
arthur
was
simply
choking
with
emotion
and
none
of
us
could
speak
in
the
hours
that
had
passed
the
fits
of
sleep
or
the
comatose
condition
that
passed
for
it
had
grown
more
frequent
so
that
the
pauses
when
conversation
was
possible
were
shortened
arthurs
presence
however
seemed
to
act
as
a
stimulant
she
rallied
a
little
and
spoke
to
him
more
brightly
than
she
had
done
since
we
arrived
he
too
pulled
himself
together

my
dearest
lucy
it
seems
an
age
since
i
heard
from
you
or
indeed
since
i
wrote
you
will
pardon
me
i
know
for
all
my
faults
when
you
have
read
all
my
budget
of
news
well
i
got
my
husband
back
all
right
when
we
arrived
at
exeter
there
was
a
carriage
waiting
for
us
and
in
it
though
he
had
an
attack
of
gout
mr
hawkins
he
took
us
to
his
house
where
there
were
rooms
for
us
all
nice
and
comfortable
and
we
dined
together
after
dinner
mr
hawkins
said
my
dears
i
want
to
drink
your
health
and
prosperity
and
may
every
blessing
attend
you
both
i
know
you
both
from
children
and
have
with
love
and
pride
seen
you
grow
up
now
i
want
you
to
make
your
home
here
with
me
i
have
left
to

neither
chick
nor
child

and
in
my
will
i
have
left
you
everything
i
cried
lucy
dear
as
jonathan
and
the
old
man
clasped
hands
our
evening
was
a
very
very
happy
one
so
here
we
are
installed
in
this
beautiful
old
house
and
from
both
my
bedroom
and
the
drawingroom
i
can
see
the
great
elms
of
the
cathedral
close
with
their
great
black
stems
standing
out
against
the
old
yellow
stone
of
the
cathedral
and
i
can
hear
the
rooks
overhead
cawing
and
cawing
and
chattering
and
gossiping
all
day
after
the
manner
of
rooksand
humans
i
am
busy
i
need
not
tell
you
arranging
things
and
housekeeping
jonathan
and
mr
hawkins
are
busy
all
day
for
now
that
jonathan
is
a
partner
mr
hawkins
wants
to
tell
him
all
about
the
clients
how
is
your
dear
mother
getting
on
i
wish
i
could
run
up
to
town
for
a
day
or
two
to
see
you
dear
but
i
dare
not
go
yet
with
so
much
on
my
shoulders
and
jonathan
wants
looking
after
still
he
is
beginning
to
put
some
flesh
on
his
bones
again
but
he
was
terribly
weakened
by
the
long
illness
even
now
he
sometimes
starts
out
of
his
sleep
in
a
sudden
way
and
awakes
all
trembling
until
i
can
coax
him
back
to
his
usual
placidity
however
thank
god
these
occasions
grow
less
frequent
as
the
days
go
on
and
they
will
in
time
pass
away
altogether
i
trust
and
now
i
have
told
you
my
news
let
me
ask
yours
when
are
you
to
be
married
and
where
and
who
is
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
what
are
you
to
wear
and
is
it
to
be
a
public
or
a
private
wedding
tell
me
all
about
it
dear
tell
me
all
about
everything
for
there
is
nothing
which
interests
you
which
will
not
be
dear
to
me
jonathan
asks
me
to
send
his
respectful
duty
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
good
enough
from
the
junior
partner
of
the
important
firm
hawkins

harker
and
so
as
you
love
me
and
he
loves
me
and
i
love
you
with
all
the
moods
and
tenses
of
the
verb
i
send
you
simply
his
love
instead
goodbye

on
you

my
dear
sir
in
accordance
with
your
wishes
i
enclose
report
of
the
conditions
of
everything
left
in
my
charge
with
regard
to
patient
renfield
there
is
more
to
say
he
has
had
another
outbreak
which
might
have
had
a
dreadful
ending
but
which
as
it
fortunately
happened
was
unattended
with
any
unhappy
results
this
afternoon
a
carriers
cart
with
two
men
made
a
call
at
the
empty
house
whose
grounds
abut
on
oursthe
house
to
which
you
will
remember
the
patient
twice
ran
away
the
men
stopped
at
our
gate
to
ask
the
porter
their
way
as
they
were
strangers
i
was
myself
looking
out
of
the
study
window
having
a
smoke
after
dinner
and
saw
one
of
them
come
up
to
the
house
as
he
passed
the
window
of
renfields
room
the
patient
began
to
rate
him
from
within
and
called
him
all
the
foul
names
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
the
man
who
seemed
a
decent
fellow
enough
contented
himself
by
telling
him
to
shut
up
for
a
foulmouthed
beggar
whereon
our
man
accused
him
of
robbing
him
and
wanting
to
murder
him
and
said
that
he
would
hinder
him
if
he
were
to
swing
for
it
i
opened
the
window
and
signed
to
the
man
not
to
notice
so
he
contented
himself
after
looking
the
place
over
and
making
up
his
mind
as
to
what
kind
of
a
place
he
had
got
to
by
saying
lor
bless
yer
sir
i
wouldnt
mind
what
was
said
to
me
in
a
bloomin
madhouse
i
pity
ye
and
the
guvnor
for
havin
to
live
in
the
house
with
a
wild
beast
like
that
then
he
asked
his
way
civilly
enough
and
i
told
him
where
the
gate
of
the
empty
house
was
he
went
away
followed
by
threats
and
curses
and
revilings
from
our
man
i
went
down
to
see
if
i
could
make
out
any
cause
for
his
anger
since
he
is
usually
such
a
wellbehaved
man
and
except
his
violent
fits
nothing
of
the
kind
had
ever
occurred
i
found
him
to
my
astonishment
quite
composed
and
most
genial
in
his
manner
i
tried
to
get
him
to
talk
of
the
incident
but
he
blandly
asked
me
questions
as
to
what
i
meant
and
led
me
to
believe
that
he
was
completely
oblivious
of
the
affair
it
was
i
am
sorry
to
say
however
only
another
instance
of
his
cunning
for
within
half
an
hour
i
heard
of
him
again
this
time
he
had
broken
out
through
the
window
of
his
room
and
was
running
down
the
avenue
i
called
to
the
attendants
to
follow
me
and
ran
after
him
for
i
feared
he
was
intent
on
some
mischief
my
fear
was
justified
when
i
saw
the
same
cart
which
had
passed
before
coming
down
the
road
having
on
it
some
great
wooden
boxes
the
men
were
wiping
their
foreheads
and
were
flushed
in
the
face
as
if
with
violent
exercise
before
i
could
get
up
to
him
the
patient
rushed
at
them
and
pulling
one
of
them
off
the
cart
began
to
knock
his
head
against
the
ground
if
i
had
not
seized
him
just
at
the
moment
i
believe
he
would
have
killed
the
man
there
and
then
the
other
fellow
jumped
down
and
struck
him
over
the
head
with
the
buttend
of
his
heavy
whip
it
was
a
terrible
blow
but
he
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
but
seized
him
also
and
struggled
with
the
three
of
us
pulling
us
to
and
fro
as
if
we
were
kittens
you
know
i
am
no
light
weight
and
the
others
were
both
burly
men
at
first
he
was
silent
in
his
fighting
but
as
we
began
to
master
him
and
the
attendants
were
putting
a
straitwaistcoat
on
him
he
began
to
shout
ill
frustrate
them
they
shant
rob
me
they
shant
murder
me
by
inches
ill
fight
for
my
lord
and
master
and
all
sorts
of
similar
incoherent
ravings
it
was
with
very
considerable
difficulty
that
they
got
him
back
to
the
house
and
put
him
in
the
padded
room
one
of
the
attendants
hardy
had
a
finger
broken
however
i
set
it
all
right
and
he
is
going
on
well
the
two
carriers
were
at
first
loud
in
their
threats
of
actions
for
damages
and
promised
to
rain
all
the
penalties
of
the
law
on
us
their
threats
were
however
mingled
with
some
sort
of
indirect
apology
for
the
defeat
of
the
two
of
them
by
a
feeble
madman
they
said
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
way
their
strength
had
been
spent
in
carrying
and
raising
the
heavy
boxes
to
the
cart
they
would
have
made
short
work
of
him
they
gave
as
another
reason
for
their
defeat
the
extraordinary
state
of
drouth
to
which
they
had
been
reduced
by
the
dusty
nature
of
their
occupation
and
the
reprehensible
distance
from
the
scene
of
their
labours
of
any
place
of
public
entertainment
i
quite
understood
their
drift
and
after
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
or
rather
more
of
the
same
and
with
each
a
sovereign
in
hand
they
made
light
of
the
attack
and
swore
that
they
would
encounter
a
worse
madman
any
day
for
the
pleasure
of
meeting
so
bloomin
good

bloke

september
my
dearest
lucy
such
a
sad
blow
has
befallen
us
mr
hawkins
has
died
very
suddenly
some
may
not
think
it
so
sad
for
us
but
we
had
both
come
to
so
love
him
that
it
really
seems
as
though
we
had
lost
a
father
i
never
knew
either
father
or
mother
so
that
the
dear
old
mans
death
is
a
real
blow
to
me
jonathan
is
greatly
distressed
it
is
not
only
that
he
feels
sorrow
deep
sorrow
for
the
dear
good
man
who
has
befriended
him
all
his
life
and
now
at
the
end
has
treated
him
like
his
own
son
and
left
him
a
fortune
which
to
people
of
our
modest
bringing
up
is
wealth
beyond
the
dream
of
avarice
but
jonathan
feels
it
on
another
account
he
says
the
amount
of
responsibility
which
it
puts
upon
him
makes
him
nervous
he
begins
to
doubt
himself
i
try
to
cheer
him
up
and
my
belief
in
him
helps
him
to
have
a
belief
in
himself
but
it
is
here
that
the
grave
shock
that
he
experienced
tells
upon
him
the
most
oh
it
is
too
hard
that
a
sweet
simple
noble
strong
nature
such
as
hisa
nature
which
enabled
him
by
our
dear
good
friends
aid
to
rise
from
clerk
to
master
in
a
few
yearsshould
be
so
injured
that
the
very
essence
of
its
strength
is
gone
forgive
me
dear
if
i
worry
you
with
my
troubles
in
the
midst
of
your
own
happiness
but
lucy
dear
i
must
tell
some
one
for
the
strain
of
keeping
up
a
brave
and
cheerful
appearance
to
jonathan
tries
me
and
i
have
no
one
here
that
i
can
confide
in
i
dread
coming
up
to
london

we
must
do
the
day
after
tomorrow
for
poor
mr

in
his
will
that
he
was
to
be
buried
in
the

with
his

as
there
are
no

that
i
would
not
care
if
i
heard
this
moment
the
flapping
of
the
wings
of
the
angel
of
death
and
he
has
been
flapping
those
grim
wings
to
some
purpose
of
latelucys
mother
and
arthurs
father
and
now
let
me
get
on
with
my
work
i
duly
relieved
van
helsing
in
his
watch
over
lucy
we
wanted
arthur
to
go
to
rest
also
but
he
refused
at
first
it
was
only
when
i
told
him
that
we
should
want
him
to
help
us
during
the
day
and
that
we
must
not
all
break
down
for
want
of
rest
lest
lucy
should
suffer
that
he
agreed
to
go
van
helsing
was
very
kind
to
him
come
my
child
he
said
come
with
me
you
are
sick
and
weak
and
have
had
much
sorrow
and
much
mental
pain
as
well
as
that
tax
on
your
strength
that
we
know
of
you
must
not
be
alone
for
to
be
alone
is
to
be
full
of
fears
and
alarms
come
to
the
drawingroom
where
there
is
a
big
fire
and
there
are
two
sofas
you
shall
lie
on
one
and
i
on
the
other
and
our
sympathy
will
be
comfort
to
each
other
even
though
we
do
not
speak
and
even
if
we
sleep
arthur
went
off
with
him
casting
back
a
longing
look
on
lucys
face
which
lay
in
her
pillow
almost
whiter
than
the
lawn
she
lay
quite
still
and
i
looked
round
the
room
to
see
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
i
could
see
that
the
professor
had
carried
out
in
this
room
as
in
the
other
his
purpose
of
using
the
garlic
the
whole
of
the
windowsashes
reeked
with
it
and
round
lucys
neck
over
the
silk
handkerchief
which
van
helsing
made
her
keep
on
was
a
rough
chaplet
of
the
same
odorous
flowers
lucy
was
breathing
somewhat
stertorously
and
her
face
was
at
its
worst
for
the
open
mouth
showed
the
pale
gums
her
teeth
in
the
dim
uncertain
light
seemed
longer
and
sharper
than
they
had
been
in
the
morning
in
particular
by
some
trick
of
the
light
the
canine
teeth
looked
longer
and
sharper
than
the
rest
i
sat
down
by
her
and
presently
she
moved
uneasily
at
the
same
moment
there
came
a
sort
of
dull
flapping
or
buffeting
at
the
window
i
went
over
to
it
softly
and
peeped
out
by
the
corner
of
the
blind
there
was
a
full
moonlight
and
i
could
see
that
the
noise
was
made
by
a
great
bat
which
wheeled
rounddoubtless
attracted
by
the
light
although
so
dimand
every
now
and
again
struck
the
window
with
its
wings
when
i
came
back
to
my
seat
i
found
that
lucy
had
moved
slightly
and
had
torn
away
the
garlic
flowers
from
her
throat
i
replaced
them
as
well
as
i
could
and
sat
watching
her
presently
she
woke
and
i
gave
her
food
as
van
helsing
had
prescribed
she
took
but
a
little
and
that
languidly
there
did
not
seem
to
be
with
her
now
the
unconscious
struggle
for
life
and
strength
that
had
hitherto
so
marked
her
illness
it
struck
me
as
curious
that
the
moment
she
became
conscious
she
pressed
the
garlic
flowers
close
to
her
it
was
certainly
odd
that
whenever
she
got
into
that
lethargic
state
with
the
stertorous
breathing
she
put
the
flowers
from
her
but
that
when
she
waked
she
clutched
them
close
there
was
no
possibility
of
making
any
mistake
about
this
for
in
the
long
hours
that
followed
she
had
many
spells
of
sleeping
and
waking
and
repeated
both
actions
many
times
at
six
oclock
van
helsing
came
to
relieve
me
arthur
had
then
fallen
into
a
doze
and
he
mercifully
let
him
sleep
on
when
he
saw
lucys
face
i
could
hear
the
sissing
indraw
of
his
breath
and
he
said
to
me
in
a
sharp
whisper
draw
up
the
blind
i
want
light
then
he
bent
down
and
with
his
face
almost
touching
lucys
examined
her
carefully
he
removed
the
flowers
and
lifted
the
silk
handkerchief
from
her
throat
as
he
did
so
he
started
back
and
i
could
hear
his
ejaculation
mein
gott
as
it
was
smothered
in
his
throat
i
bent
over
and
looked
too
and
as
i
noticed
some
queer
chill
came
over
me
the
wounds
on
the
throat
had
absolutely
disappeared
for
fully
five
minutes
van
helsing
stood
looking
at
her
with
his
face
at
its
sternest
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
calmly
she
is
dying
it
will
not
be
long
now
it
will
be
much
difference
mark
me
whether
she
dies
conscious
or
in
her
sleep
wake
that
poor
boy
and
let
him
come
and
see
the
last
he
trusts
us
and
we
have
promised
him
i
went
to
the
diningroom
and
waked
him
he
was
dazed
for
a
moment
but
when
he
saw
the
sunlight
streaming
in
through
the
edges
of
the
shutters
he
thought
he
was
late
and
expressed
his
fear
i
assured
him
that
lucy
was
still
asleep
but
told
him
as
gently
as
i
could
that
both
van
helsing
and
i
feared
that
the
end
was
near
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
slid
down
on
his
knees
by
the
sofa
where
he
remained
perhaps
a
minute
with
his
head
buried
praying
whilst
his
shoulders
shook
with
grief
i
took
him
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
up
come
i
said
my
dear
old
fellow
summon
all
your
fortitude
it
will
be
best
and
easiest
for
her
when
we
came
into
lucys
room
i
could
see
that
van
helsing
had
with
his
usual
forethought
been
putting
matters
straight
and
making
everything
look
as
pleasing
as
possible
he
had
even
brushed
lucys
hair
so
that
it
lay
on
the
pillow
in
its
usual
sunny
ripples
when
we
came
into
the
room
she
opened
her
eyes
and
seeing
him
whispered
softly
arthur
oh
my
love
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
he
was
stooping
to
kiss
her
when
van
helsing
motioned
him
back
no
he
whispered
not
yet
hold
her
hand
it
will
comfort
her
more
so
arthur
took
her
hand
and
knelt
beside
her
and
she
looked
her
best
with
all
the
soft
lines
matching
the
angelic
beauty
of
her
eyes
then
gradually
her
eyes
closed
and
she
sank
to
sleep
for
a
little
bit
her
breast
heaved
softly
and
her
breath
came
and
went
like
a
tired
childs
and
then
insensibly
there
came
the
strange
change
which
i
had
noticed
in
the
night
her
breathing
grew
stertorous
the
mouth
opened
and
the
pale
gums
drawn
back
made
the
teeth
look
longer
and
sharper
than
ever
in
a
sort
of
sleepwaking
vague
unconscious
way
she
opened
her
eyes
which
were
now
dull
and
hard
at
once
and
said
in
a
soft
voluptuous
voice
such
as
i
had
never
heard
from
her
lips
arthur
oh
my
love
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
kiss
me
arthur
bent
eagerly
over
to
kiss
her
but
at
that
instant
van
helsing
who
like
me
had
been
startled
by
her
voice
swooped
upon
him
and
catching
him
by
the
neck
with
both
hands
dragged
him
back
with
a
fury
of
strength
which
i
never
thought
he
could
have
possessed
and
actually
hurled
him
almost
across
the
room
not
for
your
life
he
said
not
for
your
living
soul
and
hers
and
he
stood
between
them
like
a
lion
at
bay
arthur
was
so
taken
aback
that
he
did
not
for
a
moment
know
what
to
do
or
say
and
before
any
impulse
of
violence
could
seize
him
he
realised
the
place
and
the
occasion
and
stood
silent
waiting
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
lucy
as
did
van
helsing
and
we
saw
a
spasm
as
of
rage
flit
like
a
shadow
over
her
face
the
sharp
teeth
champed
together
then
her
eyes
closed
and
she
breathed
heavily
very
shortly
after
she
opened
her
eyes
in
all
their
softness
and
putting
out
her
poor
pale
thin
hand
took
van
helsings
great
brown
one
drawing
it
to
her
she
kissed
it
my
true
friend
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
but
with
untellable
pathos
my
true
friend
and
his
oh
guard
him
and
give
me
peace
i
swear
it
he
said
solemnly
kneeling
beside
her
and
holding
up
his
hand
as
one
who
registers
an
oath
then
he
turned
to
arthur
and
said
to
him
come
my
child
take
her
hand
in
yours
and
kiss
her
on
the
forehead
and
only
once
their
eyes
met
instead
of
their
lips
and
so
they
parted
lucys
eyes
closed
and
van
helsing
who
had
been
watching
closely
took
arthurs
arm
and
drew
him
away
and
then
lucys
breathing
became
stertorous
again
and
all
at
once
it
ceased
it
is
all
over
said
van
helsing
she
is
dead
i
took
arthur
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
to
the
drawingroom
where
he
sat
down
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
sobbing
in
a
way
that
nearly
broke
me
down
to
see
i
went
back
to
the
room
and
found
van
helsing
looking
at
poor
lucy
and
his
face
was
sterner
than
ever
some
change
had
come
over
her
body
death
had
given
back
part
of
her
beauty
for
her
brow
and
cheeks
had
recovered
some
of
their
flowing
lines
even
the
lips
had
lost
their
deadly
pallor
it
was
as
if
the
blood
no
longer
needed
for
the
working
of
the
heart
had
gone
to
make
the
harshness
of
death
as
little
rude
as
might
be
we
thought
her
dying
whilst
she
slept
and
sleeping
when
she
died
i
stood
beside
van
helsing
and
said
ah
well
poor
girl
there
is
peace
for
her
at
last
it
is
the
end
he
turned
to
me
and
said
with
grave
solemnity
not
so
alas
not
so
it
is
only
the
beginning
when
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
only
shook
his
head
and
answered
we
can
do
nothing
as
yet
wait
and
see
chapter
xiii
dr
sewards
diarycontinued
the
funeral
was
arranged
for
the
next
succeeding
day
so
that
lucy
and
her
mother
might
be
buried
together
i
attended
to
all
the
ghastly
formalities
and
the
urbane
undertaker
proved
that
his
staff
were
afflictedor
blessedwith
something
of
his
own
obsequious
suavity
even
the
woman
who
performed
the
last
offices
for
the
dead
remarked
to
me
in
a
confidential
brotherprofessional
way
when
she
had
come
out
from
the
deathchamber
she
makes
a
very
beautiful
corpse
sir
its
quite
a
privilege
to
attend
on
her
its
not
too
much
to
say
that
she
will
do
credit
to
our
establishment
i
noticed
that
van
helsing
never
kept
far
away
this
was
possible
from
the
disordered
state
of
things
in
the
household
there
were
no
relatives
at
hand
and
as
arthur
had
to
be
back
the
next
day
to
attend
at
his
fathers
funeral
we
were
unable
to
notify
any
one
who
should
have
been
bidden
under
the
circumstances
van
helsing
and
i
took
it
upon
ourselves
to
examine
papers
etc
he
insisted
upon
looking
over
lucys
papers
himself
i
asked
him
why
for
i
feared
that
he
being
a
foreigner
might
not
be
quite
aware
of
english
legal
requirements
and
so
might
in
ignorance
make
some
unnecessary
trouble
he
answered
me
i
know
i
know
you
forget
that
i
am
a
lawyer
as
well
as
a
doctor
but
this
is
not
altogether
for
the
law
you
knew
that
when
you
avoided
the
coroner
i
have
more
than
him
to
avoid
there
may
be
papers
moresuch
as
this
as
he
spoke
he
took
from
his
pocketbook
the
memorandum
which
had
been
in
lucys
breast
and
which
she
had
torn
in
her
sleep
when
you
find
anything
of
the
solicitor
who
is
for
the
late
mrs
westenra
seal
all
her
papers
and
write
him
tonight
for
me
i
watch
here
in
the
room
and
in
miss
lucys
old
room
all
night
and
i
myself
search
for
what
may
be
it
is
not
well
that
her
very
thoughts
go
into
the
hands
of
strangers
i
went
on
with
my
part
of
the
work
and
in
another
half
hour
had
found
the
name
and
address
of
mrs
westenras
solicitor
and
had
written
to
him
all
the
poor
ladys
papers
were
in
order
explicit
directions
regarding
the
place
of
burial
were
given
i
had
hardly
sealed
the
letter
when
to
my
surprise
van
helsing
walked
into
the
room
saying
can
i
help
you
friend
john
i
am
free
and
if
i
may
my
service
is
to
you
have
you
got
what
you
looked
for
i
asked
to
which
he
replied
i
did
not
look
for
any
specific
thing
i
only
hoped
to
find
and
find
i
have
all
that
there
wasonly
some
letters
and
a
few
memoranda
and
a
diary
new
begun
but
i
have
them
here
and
we
shall
for
the
present
say
nothing
of
them
i
shall
see
that
poor
lad
tomorrow
evening
and
with
his
sanction
i
shall
use
some
when
we
had
finished
the
work
in
hand
he
said
to
me
and
now
friend
john
i
think
we
may
to
bed
we
want
sleep
both
you
and
i
and
rest
to
recuperate
tomorrow
we
shall
have
much
to
do
but
for
the
tonight
there
is
no
need
of
us
alas
before
turning
in
we
went
to
look
at
poor
lucy
the
undertaker
had
certainly
done
his
work
well
for
the
room
was
turned
into
a
small
chapelle
ardente
there
was
a
wilderness
of
beautiful
white
flowers
and
death
was
made
as
little
repulsive
as
might
be
the
end
of
the
windingsheet
was
laid
over
the
face
when
the
professor
bent
over
and
turned
it
gently
back
we
both
started
at
the
beauty
before
us
the
tall
wax
candles
showing
a
sufficient
light
to
note
it
well
all
lucys
loveliness
had
come
back
to
her
in
death
and
the
hours
that
had
passed
instead
of
leaving
traces
of
decays
effacing
fingers
had
but
restored
the
beauty
of
life
till
positively
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
that
i
was
looking
at
a
corpse
the
professor
looked
sternly
grave
he
had
not
loved
her
as
i
had
and
there
was
no
need
for
tears
in
his
eyes
he
said
to
me
remain
till
i
return
and
left
the
room
he
came
back
with
a
handful
of
wild
garlic
from
the
box
waiting
in
the
hall
but
which
had
not
been
opened
and
placed
the
flowers
amongst
the
others
on
and
around
the
bed
then
he
took
from
his
neck
inside
his
collar
a
little
gold
crucifix
and
placed
it
over
the
mouth
he
restored
the
sheet
to
its
place
and
we
came
away
i
was
undressing
in
my
own
room
when
with
a
premonitory
tap
at
the
door
he
entered
and
at
once
began
to
speak
tomorrow
i
want
you
to
bring
me
before
night
a
set
of
postmortem
knives
must
we
make
an
autopsy
i
asked
yes
and
no
i
want
to
operate
but
not
as
you
think
let
me
tell
you
now
but
not
a
word
to
another
i
want
to
cut
off
her
head
and
take
out
her
heart
ah
you
a
surgeon
and
so
shocked
you
whom
i
have
seen
with
no
tremble
of
hand
or
heart
do
operations
of
life
and
death
that
make
the
rest
shudder
oh
but
i
must
not
forget
my
dear
friend
john
that
you
loved
her
and
i
have
not
forgotten
it
for
it
is
i
that
shall
operate
and
you
must
only
help
i
would
like
to
do
it
tonight
but
for
arthur
i
must
not
he
will
be
free
after
his
fathers
funeral
tomorrow
and
he
will
want
to
see
herto
see
it
then
when
she
is
coffined
ready
for
the
next
day
you
and
i
shall
come
when
all
sleep
we
shall
unscrew
the
coffinlid
and
shall
do
our
operation
and
then
replace
all
so
that
none
know
save
we
alone
but
why
do
it
at
all
the
girl
is
dead
why
mutilate
her
poor
body
without
need
and
if
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
postmortem
and
nothing
to
gain
by
itno
good
to
her
to
us
to
science
to
human
knowledgewhy
do
it
without
such
it
is
monstrous
for
answer
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
with
infinite
tenderness
friend
john
i
pity
your
poor
bleeding
heart
and
i
love
you
the
more
because
it
does
so
bleed
if
i
could
i
would
take
on
myself
the
burden
that
you
do
bear
but
there
are
things
that
you
know
not
but
that
you
shall
know
and
bless
me
for
knowing
though
they
are
not
pleasant
things
john
my
child
you
have
been
my
friend
now
many
years
and
yet
did
you
ever
know
me
to
do
any
without
good
cause
i
may
erri
am
but
man
but
i
believe
in
all
i
do
was
it
not
for
these
causes
that
you
send
for
me
when
the
great
trouble
came
yes
were
you
not
amazed
nay
horrified
when
i
would
not
let
arthur
kiss
his
lovethough
she
was
dyingand
snatched
him
away
by
all
my
strength
yes
and
yet
you
saw
how
she
thanked
me
with
her
so
beautiful
dying
eyes
her
voice
too
so
weak
and
she
kiss
my
rough
old
hand
and
bless
me
yes
and
did
you
not
hear
me
swear
promise
to
her
that
so
she
closed
her
eyes
grateful
yes
well
i
have
good
reason
now
for
all
i
want
to
do
you
have
for
many
years
trust
me
you
have
believe
me
weeks
past
when
there
be
things
so
strange
that
you
might
have
well
doubt
believe
me
yet
a
little
friend
john
if
you
trust
me
not
then
i
must
tell
what
i
think
and
that
is
not
perhaps
well
and
if
i
workas
work
i
shall
no
matter
trust
or
no
trustwithout
my
friend
trust
in
me
i
work
with
heavy
heart
and
feel
oh
so
lonely
when
i
want
all
help
and
courage
that
may
be
he
paused
a
moment
and
went
on
solemnly
friend
john
there
are
strange
and
terrible
days
before
us
let
us
not
be
two
but
one
that
so
we
work
to
a
good
end
will
you
not
have
faith
in
me
i
took
his
hand
and
promised
him
i
held
my
door
open
as
he
went
away
and
watched
him
go
into
his
room
and
close
the
door
as
i
stood
without
moving
i
saw
one
of
the
maids
pass
silently
along
the
passageshe
had
her
back
towards
me
so
did
not
see
meand
go
into
the
room
where
lucy
lay
the
sight
touched
me
devotion
is
so
rare
and
we
are
so
grateful
to
those
who
show
it
unasked
to
those
we
love
here
was
a
poor
girl
putting
aside
the
terrors
which
she
naturally
had
of
death
to
go
watch
alone
by
the
bier
of
the
mistress
whom
she
loved
so
that
the
poor
clay
might
not
be
lonely
till
laid
to
eternal
rest





i
must
have
slept
long
and
soundly
for
it
was
broad
daylight
when
van
helsing
waked
me
by
coming
into
my
room
he
came
over
to
my
bedside
and
said
you
need
not
trouble
about
the
knives
we
shall
not
do
it
why
not
i
asked
for
his
solemnity
of
the
night
before
had
greatly
impressed
me
because
he
said
sternly
it
is
too
lateor
too
early
see
here
he
held
up
the
little
golden
crucifix
this
was
stolen
in
the
night
how
stolen
i
asked
in
wonder
since
you
have
it
now
because
i
get
it
back
from
the
worthless
wretch
who
stole
it
from
the
woman
who
robbed
the
dead
and
the
living
her
punishment
will
surely
come
but
not
through
me
she
knew
not
altogether
what
she
did
and
thus
unknowing
she
only
stole
now
we
must
wait
he
went
away
on
the
word
leaving
me
with
a
new
mystery
to
think
of
a
new
puzzle
to
grapple
with
the
forenoon
was
a
dreary
time
but
at
noon
the
solicitor
came
mr
marquand
of
wholeman
sons
marquand

lidderdale
he
was
very
genial
and
very
appreciative
of
what
we
had
done
and
took
off
our
hands
all
cares
as
to
details
during
lunch
he
told
us
that
mrs
westenra
had
for
some
time
expected
sudden
death
from
her
heart
and
had
put
her
affairs
in
absolute
order
he
informed
us
that
with
the
exception
of
a
certain
entailed
property
of
lucys
fathers
which
now
in
default
of
direct
issue
went
back
to
a
distant
branch
of
the
family
the
whole
estate
real
and
personal
was
left
absolutely
to
arthur
holmwood
when
he
had
told
us
so
much
he
went
on
frankly
we
did
our
best
to
prevent
such
a
testamentary
disposition
and
pointed
out
certain
contingencies
that
might
leave
her
daughter
either
penniless
or
not
so
free
as
she
should
be
to
act
regarding
a
matrimonial
alliance
indeed
we
pressed
the
matter
so
far
that
we
almost
came
into
collision
for
she
asked
us
if
we
were
or
were
not
prepared
to
carry
out
her
wishes
of
course
we
had
then
no
alternative
but
to
accept
we
were
right
in
principle
and
ninetynine
times
out
of
a
hundred
we
should
have
proved
by
the
logic
of
events
the
accuracy
of
our
judgment
frankly
however
i
must
admit
that
in
this
case
any
other
form
of
disposition
would
have
rendered
impossible
the
carrying
out
of
her
wishes
for
by
her
predeceasing
her
daughter
the
latter
would
have
come
into
possession
of
the
property
and
even
had
she
only
survived
her
mother
by
five
minutes
her
property
would
in
case
there
were
no
willand
a
will
was
a
practical
impossibility
in
such
a
casehave
been
treated
at
her
decease
as
under
intestacy
in
which
case
lord
godalming
though
so
dear
a
friend
would
have
had
no
claim
in
the
world
and
the
inheritors
being
remote
would
not
be
likely
to
abandon
their
just
rights
for
sentimental
reasons
regarding
an
entire
stranger
i
assure
you
my
dear
sirs
i
am
rejoiced
at
the
result
perfectly
rejoiced
he
was
a
good
fellow
but
his
rejoicing
at
the
one
little
partin
which
he
was
officially
interestedof
so
great
a
tragedy
was
an
objectlesson
in
the
limitations
of
sympathetic
understanding
he
did
not
remain
long
but
said
he
would
look
in
later
in
the
day
and
see
lord
godalming
his
coming
however
had
been
a
certain
comfort
to
us
since
it
assured
us
that
we
should
not
have
to
dread
hostile
criticism
as
to
any
of
our
acts
arthur
was
expected
at
five
oclock
so
a
little
before
that
time
we
visited
the
deathchamber
it
was
so
in
very
truth
for
now
both
mother
and
daughter
lay
in
it
the
undertaker
true
to
his
craft
had
made
the
best
display
he
could
of
his
goods
and
there
was
a
mortuary
air
about
the
place
that
lowered
our
spirits
at
once
van
helsing
ordered
the
former
arrangement
to
be
adhered
to
explaining
that
as
lord
godalming
was
coming
very
soon
it
would
be
less
harrowing
to
his
feelings
to
see
all
that
was
left
of
his
fiance
quite
alone
the
undertaker
seemed
shocked
at
his
own
stupidity
and
exerted
himself
to
restore
things
to
the
condition
in
which
we
left
them
the
night
before
so
that
when
arthur
came
such
shocks
to
his
feelings
as
we
could
avoid
were
saved
poor
fellow
he
looked
desperately
sad
and
broken
even
his
stalwart
manhood
seemed
to
have
shrunk
somewhat
under
the
strain
of
his
muchtried
emotions
he
had
i
knew
been
very
genuinely
and
devotedly
attached
to
his
father
and
to
lose
him
and
at
such
a
time
was
a
bitter
blow
to
him
with
me
he
was
warm
as
ever
and
to
van
helsing
he
was
sweetly
courteous
but
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
there
was
some
constraint
with
him
the
professor
noticed
it
too
and
motioned
me
to
bring
him
upstairs
i
did
so
and
left
him
at
the
door
of
the
room
as
i
felt
he
would
like
to
be
quite
alone
with
her
but
he
took
my
arm
and
led
me
in
saying
huskily
you
loved
her
too
old
fellow
she
told
me
all
about
it
and
there
was
no
friend
had
a
closer
place
in
her
heart
than
you
i
dont
know
how
to
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
her
i
cant
think
yet
here
he
suddenly
broke
down
and
threw
his
arms
round
my
shoulders
and
laid
his
head
on
my
breast
crying
oh
jack
jack
what
shall
i
do
the
whole
of
life
seems
gone
from
me
all
at
once
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
wide
world
for
me
to
live
for
i
comforted
him
as
well
as
i
could
in
such
cases
men
do
not
need
much
expression
a
grip
of
the
hand
the
tightening
of
an
arm
over
the
shoulder
a
sob
in
unison
are
expressions
of
sympathy
dear
to
a
mans
heart
i
stood
still
and
silent
till
his
sobs
died
away
and
then
i
said
softly
to
him
come
and
look
at
her
together
we
moved
over
to
the
bed
and
i
lifted
the
lawn
from
her
face
god
how
beautiful
she
was
every
hour
seemed
to
be
enhancing
her
loveliness
it
frightened
and
amazed
me
somewhat
and
as
for
arthur
he
fell
atrembling
and
finally
was
shaken
with
doubt
as
with
an
ague
at
last
after
a
long
pause
he
said
to
me
in
a
faint
whisper
jack
is
she
really
dead
i
assured
him
sadly
that
it
was
so
and
went
on
to
suggestfor
i
felt
that
such
a
horrible
doubt
should
not
have
life
for
a
moment
longer
than
i
could
helpthat
it
often
happened
that
after
death
faces
became
softened
and
even
resolved
into
their
youthful
beauty
that
this
was
especially
so
when
death
had
been
preceded
by
any
acute
or
prolonged
suffering
it
seemed
to
quite
do
away
with
any
doubt
and
after
kneeling
beside
the
couch
for
a
while
and
looking
at
her
lovingly
and
long
he
turned
aside
i
told
him
that
that
must
be
goodbye
as
the
coffin
had
to
be
prepared
so
he
went
back
and
took
her
dead
hand
in
his
and
kissed
it
and
bent
over
and
kissed
her
forehead
he
came
away
fondly
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
at
her
as
he
came
i
left
him
in
the
drawingroom
and
told
van
helsing
that
he
had
said
goodbye
so
the
latter
went
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
the
undertakers
men
to
proceed
with
the
preparations
and
to
screw
up
the
coffin
when
he
came
out
of
the
room
again
i
told
him
of
arthurs
question
and
he
replied
i
am
not
surprised
just
now
i
doubted
for
a
moment
myself
we
all
dined
together
and
i
could
see
that
poor
art
was
trying
to
make
the
best
of
things
van
helsing
had
been
silent
all
dinnertime
but
when
we
had
lit
our
cigars
he
said
lord
but
arthur
interrupted
him
no
no
not
that
for
gods
sake
not
yet
at
any
rate
forgive
me
sir
i
did
not
mean
to
speak
offensively
it
is
only
because
my
loss
is
so
recent
the
professor
answered
very
sweetly
i
only
used
that
name
because
i
was
in
doubt
i
must
not
call
you
mr
and
i
have
grown
to
love
youyes
my
dear
boy
to
love
youas
arthur
arthur
held
out
his
hand
and
took
the
old
mans
warmly
call
me
what
you
will
he
said
i
hope
i
may
always
have
the
title
of
a
friend
and
let
me
say
that
i
am
at
a
loss
for
words
to
thank
you
for
your
goodness
to
my
poor
dear
he
paused
a
moment
and
went
on
i
know
that
she
understood
your
goodness
even
better
than
i
do
and
if
i
was
rude
or
in
any
way
wanting
at
that
time
you
acted
soyou
rememberthe
professor
noddedyou
must
forgive
me
he
answered
with
a
grave
kindness
i
know
it
was
hard
for
you
to
quite
trust
me
then
for
to
trust
such
violence
needs
to
understand
and
i
take
it
that
you
do
notthat
you
cannottrust
me
now
for
you
do
not
yet
understand
and
there
may
be
more
times
when
i
shall
want
you
to
trust
when
you
cannotand
may
notand
must
not
yet
understand
but
the
time
will
come
when
your
trust
shall
be
whole
and
complete
in
me
and
when
you
shall
understand
as
though
the
sunlight
himself
shone
through
then
you
shall
bless
me
from
first
to
last
for
your
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
others
and
for
her
dear
sake
to
whom
i
swore
to
protect
and
indeed
indeed
sir
said
arthur
warmly
i
shall
in
all
ways
trust
you
i
know
and
believe
you
have
a
very
noble
heart
and
you
are
jacks
friend
and
you
were
hers
you
shall
do
what
you
like
the
professor
cleared
his
throat
a
couple
of
times
as
though
about
to
speak
and
finally
said
may
i
ask
you
something
now
certainly
you
know
that
mrs
westenra
left
you
all
her
property
no
poor
dear
i
never
thought
of
it
and
as
it
is
all
yours
you
have
a
right
to
deal
with
it
as
you
will
i
want
you
to
give
me
permission
to
read
all
miss
lucys
papers
and
letters
believe
me
it
is
no
idle
curiosity
i
have
a
motive
of
which
be
sure
she
would
have
approved
i
have
them
all
here
i
took
them
before
we
knew
that
all
was
yours
so
that
no
strange
hand
might
touch
themno
strange
eye
look
through
words
into
her
soul
i
shall
keep
them
if
i
may
even
you
may
not
see
them
yet
but
i
shall
keep
them
safe
no
word
shall
be
lost
and
in
the
good
time
i
shall
give
them
back
to
you
its
a
hard
thing
i
ask
but
you
will
do
it
will
you
not
for
lucys
sake
arthur
spoke
out
heartily
like
his
old
self
dr
van
helsing
you
may
do
what
you
will
i
feel
that
in
saying
this
i
am
doing
what
my
dear
one
would
have
approved
i
shall
not
trouble
you
with
questions
till
the
time
comes
the
old
professor
stood
up
as
he
said
solemnly
and
you
are
right
there
will
be
pain
for
us
all
but
it
will
not
be
all
pain
nor
will
this
pain
be
the
last
we
and
you
tooyou
most
of
all
my
dear
boywill
have
to
pass
through
the
bitter
water
before
we
reach
the
sweet
but
we
must
be
brave
of
heart
and
unselfish
and
do
our
duty
and
all
will
be
well
i
slept
on
a
sofa
in
arthurs
room
that
night
van
helsing
did
not
go
to
bed
at
all
he
went
to
and
fro
as
if
patrolling
the
house
and
was
never
out
of
sight
of
the
room
where
lucy
lay
in
her
coffin
strewn
with
the
wild
garlic
flowers
which
sent
through
the
odour
of
lily
and
rose
a
heavy
overpowering
smell

the
train
to
exeter
jonathan
sleeping
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
the
last
entry
was
made
and
yet
how
much
between
then
in
whitby
and
all
the
world
before
me
jonathan
away
and
no
news
of
him
and
now
married
to
jonathan
jonathan
a
solicitor
a
partner
rich
master
of
his
business
mr
hawkins
dead
and
buried
and
jonathan
with
another
attack
that
may
harm
him
some
day
he
may
ask
me
about
it
down
it
all
goes
i
am
rusty
in
my
shorthandsee
what
unexpected
prosperity
does
for
usso
it
may
be
as
well
to
freshen
it
up
again
with
an
exercise
anyhow
the
service
was
very
simple
and
very
solemn
there
were
only
ourselves
and
the
servants
there
one
or
two
old
friends
of
his
from
exeter
his
london
agent
and
a
gentleman
representing
sir
john
paxton
the
president
of
the
incorporated
law
society
jonathan
and
i
stood
hand
in
hand
and
we
felt
that
our
best
and
dearest
friend
was
gone
from
us
we
came
back
to
town
quietly
taking
a
bus
to
hyde
park
corner
jonathan
thought
it
would
interest
me
to
go
into
the
row
for
a
while
so
we
sat
down
but
there
were
very
few
people
there
and
it
was
sadlooking
and
desolate
to
see
so
many
empty
chairs
it
made
us
think
of
the
empty
chair
at
home
so
we
got
up
and
walked
down
piccadilly
jonathan
was
holding
me
by
the
arm
the
way
he
used
to
in
old
days
before
i
went
to
school
i
felt
it
very
improper
for
you
cant
go
on
for
some
years
teaching
etiquette
and
decorum
to
other
girls
without
the
pedantry
of
it
biting
into
yourself
a
bit
but
it
was
jonathan
and
he
was
my
husband
and
we
didnt
know
anybody
who
saw
usand
we
didnt
care
if
they
didso
on
we
walked
i
was
looking
at
a
very
beautiful
girl
in
a
big
cartwheel
hat
sitting
in
a
victoria
outside
guilianos
when
i
felt
jonathan
clutch
my
arm
so
tight
that
he
hurt
me
and
he
said
under
his
breath
my
god
i
am
always
anxious
about
jonathan
for
i
fear
that
some
nervous
fit
may
upset
him
again
so
i
turned
to
him
quickly
and
asked
him
what
it
was
that
disturbed
him
he
was
very
pale
and
his
eyes
seemed
bulging
out
as
half
in
terror
and
half
in
amazement
he
gazed
at
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
beaky
nose
and
black
moustache
and
pointed
beard
who
was
also
observing
the
pretty
girl
he
was
looking
at
her
so
hard
that
he
did
not
see
either
of
us
and
so
i
had
a
good
view
of
him
his
face
was
not
a
good
face
it
was
hard
and
cruel
and
sensual
and
his
big
white
teeth
that
looked
all
the
whiter
because
his
lips
were
so
red
were
pointed
like
an
animals
jonathan
kept
staring
at
him
till
i
was
afraid
he
would
notice
i
feared
he
might
take
it
ill
he
looked
so
fierce
and
nasty
i
asked
jonathan
why
he
was
disturbed
and
he
answered
evidently
thinking
that
i
knew
as
much
about
it
as
he
did
do
you
see
who
it
is
no
dear
i
said
i
dont
know
him
who
is
it
his
answer
seemed
to
shock
and
thrill
me
for
it
was
said
as
if
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
to
me
mina
to
whom
he
was
speaking
it
is
the
man
himself
the
poor
dear
was
evidently
terrified
at
somethingvery
greatly
terrified
i
do
believe
that
if
he
had
not
had
me
to
lean
on
and
to
support
him
he
would
have
sunk
down
he
kept
staring
a
man
came
out
of
the
shop
with
a
small
parcel
and
gave
it
to
the
lady
who
then
drove
off
the
dark
man
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
and
when
the
carriage
moved
up
piccadilly
he
followed
in
the
same
direction
and
hailed
a
hansom
jonathan
kept
looking
after
him
and
said
as
if
to
himself
i
believe
it
is
the
count
but
he
has
grown
young
my
god
if
this
be
so
oh
my
god
my
god
if
i
only
knew
if
i
only
knew
he
was
distressing
himself
so
much
that
i
feared
to
keep
his
mind
on
the
subject
by
asking
him
any
questions
so
i
remained
silent
i
drew
him
away
quietly
and
he
holding
my
arm
came
easily
we
walked
a
little
further
and
then
went
in
and
sat
for
a
while
in
the
green
park
it
was
a
hot
day
for
autumn
and
there
was
a
comfortable
seat
in
a
shady
place
after
a
few
minutes
staring
at
nothing
jonathans
eyes
closed
and
he
went
quietly
into
a
sleep
with
his
head
on
my
shoulder
i
thought
it
was
the
best
thing
for
him
so
did
not
disturb
him
in
about
twenty
minutes
he
woke
up
and
said
to
me
quite
cheerfully
why
mina
have
i
been
asleep
oh
do
forgive
me
for
being
so
rude
come
and
well
have
a
cup
of
tea
somewhere
he
had
evidently
forgotten
all
about
the
dark
stranger
as
in
his

he
had
forgotten
all
that
this
episode
had
reminded
him
of
i
dont
like
this
lapsing
into
forgetfulness
it
may
make
or
continue
some
injury
to
the
brain
i
must
not
ask
him
for
fear
i
shall
do
more
harm
than
good
but
i
must
somehow
learn
the
facts
of
his
journey
abroad
the
time
is
come
i
fear
when
i
must
open
that
parcel
and
know
what
is
written
oh
jonathan
you
will
i

pale

a

from
van

whoever
he
may
be
you
will
be

septemberit
is
all
over
arthur
has
gone
back
to
ring
and
has
taken
quincey
morris
with
him
what
a
fine
fellow
is
quincey
i
believe
in
my
heart
of
hearts
that
he
suffered
as
much
about
lucys
death
as
any
of
us
but
he
bore
himself
through
it
like
a
moral
viking
if
america
can
go
on
breeding
men
like
that
she
will
be
a
power
in
the
world
indeed
van
helsing
is
lying
down
having
a
rest
preparatory
to
his
journey
he
goes
over
to
amsterdam
tonight
but
says
he
returns
tomorrow
night
that
he
only
wants
to
make
some
arrangements
which
can
only
be
made
personally
he
is
to
stop
with
me
then
if
he
can
he
says
he
has
work
to
do
in
london
which
may
take
him
some
time
poor
old
fellow
i
fear
that
the
strain
of
the
past
week
has
broken
down
even
his
iron
strength
all
the
time
of
the
burial
he
was
i
could
see
putting
some
terrible
restraint
on
himself
when
it
was
all
over
we
were
standing
beside
arthur
who
poor
fellow
was
speaking
of
his
part
in
the
operation
where
his
blood
had
been
transfused
to
his
lucys
veins
i
could
see
van
helsings
face
grow
white
and
purple
by
turns
arthur
was
saying
that
he
felt
since
then
as
if
they
two
had
been
really
married
and
that
she
was
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
none
of
us
said
a
word
of
the
other
operations
and
none
of
us
ever
shall
arthur
and
quincey
went
away
together
to
the
station
and
van
helsing
and
i
came
on
here
the
moment
we
were
alone
in
the
carriage
he
gave
way
to
a
regular
fit
of
hysterics
he
has
denied
to
me
since
that
it
was
hysterics
and
insisted
that
it
was
only
his
sense
of
humour
asserting
itself
under
very
terrible
conditions
he
laughed
till
he
cried
and
i
had
to
draw
down
the
blinds
lest
any
one
should
see
us
and
misjudge
and
then
he
cried
till
he
laughed
again
and
laughed
and
cried
together
just
as
a
woman
does
i
tried
to
be
stern
with
him
as
one
is
to
a
woman
under
the
circumstances
but
it
had
no
effect
men
and
women
are
so
different
in
manifestations
of
nervous
strength
or
weakness
then
when
his
face
grew
grave
and
stern
again
i
asked
him
why
his
mirth
and
why
at
such
a
time
his
reply
was
in
a
way
characteristic
of
him
for
it
was
logical
and
forceful
and
mysterious
he
said
ah
you
dont
comprehend
friend
john
do
not
think
that
i
am
not
sad
though
i
laugh
see
i
have
cried
even
when
the
laugh
did
choke
me
but
no
more
think
that
i
am
all
sorry
when
i
cry
for
the
laugh
he
come
just
the
same
keep
it
always
with
you
that
laughter
who
knock
at
your
door
and
say
may
i
come
in
is
not
the
true
laughter
no
he
is
a
king
and
he
come
when
and
how
he
like
he
ask
no
person
he
choose
no
time
of
suitability
he
say
i
am
here
behold
in
example
i
grieve
my
heart
out
for
that
so
sweet
young
girl
i
give
my
blood
for
her
though
i
am
old
and
worn
i
give
my
time
my
skill
my
sleep
i
let
my
other
sufferers
want
that
so
she
may
have
all
and
yet
i
can
laugh
at
her
very
gravelaugh
when
the
clay
from
the
spade
of
the
sexton
drop
upon
her
coffin
and
say
thud
thud
to
my
heart
till
it
send
back
the
blood
from
my
cheek
my
heart
bleed
for
that
poor
boythat
dear
boy
so
of
the
age
of
mine
own
boy
had
i
been
so
blessed
that
he
live
and
with
his
hair
and
eyes
the
same
there
you
know
now
why
i
love
him
so
and
yet
when
he
say
things
that
touch
my
husbandheart
to
the
quick
and
make
my
fatherheart
yearn
to
him
as
to
no
other
mannot
even
to
you
friend
john
for
we
are
more
level
in
experiences
than
father
and
sonyet
even
at
such
moment
king
laugh
he
come
to
me
and
shout
and
bellow
in
my
ear
here
i
am
here
i
am
till
the
blood
come
dance
back
and
bring
some
of
the
sunshine
that
he
carry
with
him
to
my
cheek
oh
friend
john
it
is
a
strange
world
a
sad
world
a
world
full
of
miseries
and
woes
and
troubles
and
yet
when
king
laugh
come
he
make
them
all
dance
to
the
tune
he
play
bleeding
hearts
and
dry
bones
of
the
churchyard
and
tears
that
burn
as
they
fallall
dance
together
to
the
music
that
he
make
with
that
smileless
mouth
of
him
and
believe
me
friend
john
that
he
is
good
to
come
and
kind
ah
we
men
and
women
are
like
ropes
drawn
tight
with
strain
that
pull
us
different
ways
then
tears
come
and
like
the
rain
on
the
ropes
they
brace
us
up
until
perhaps
the
strain
become
too
great
and
we
break
but
king
laugh
he
come
like
the
sunshine
and
he
ease
off
the
strain
again
and
we
bear
to
go
on
with
our
labour
what
it
may
be
i
did
not
like
to
wound
him
by
pretending
not
to
see
his
idea
but
as
i
did
not
yet
understand
the
cause
of
his
laughter
i
asked
him
as
he
answered
me
his
face
grew
stern
and
he
said
in
quite
a
different
tone
oh
it
was
the
grim
irony
of
it
allthis
so
lovely
lady
garlanded
with
flowers
that
looked
so
fair
as
life
till
one
by
one
we
wondered
if
she
were
truly
dead
she
laid
in
that
so
fine
marble
house
in
that
lonely
churchyard
where
rest
so
many
of
her
kin
laid
there
with
the
mother
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
loved
and
that
sacred
bell
going
toll
toll
toll
so
sad
and
slow
and
those
holy
men
with
the
white
garments
of
the
angel
pretending
to
read
books
and
yet
all
the
time
their
eyes
never
on
the
page
and
all
of
us
with
the
bowed
head
and
all
for
what
she
is
dead
so
is
it
not
well
for
the
life
of
me
professor
i
said
i
cant
see
anything
to
laugh
at
in
all
that
why
your
explanation
makes
it
a
harder
puzzle
than
before
but
even
if
the
burial
service
was
comic
what
about
poor
art
and
his
trouble
why
his
heart
was
simply
breaking
just
so
said
he
not
that
the
transfusion
of
his
blood
to
her
veins
had
made
her
truly
his
bride
yes
and
it
was
a
sweet
and
comforting
idea
for
him
quite
so
but
there
was
a
difficulty
friend
john
if
so
that
then
what
about
the
others
ho
ho
then
this
so
sweet
maid
is
a
polyandrist
and
me
with
my
poor
wife
dead
to
me
but
alive
by
churchs
law
though
no
wits
all
goneeven
i
who
am
faithful
husband
to
this
nownowife
am
bigamist
i
dont
see
where
the
joke
comes
in
there
either
i
said
and
i
did
not
feel
particularly
pleased
with
him
for
saying
such
things
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
and
said
friend
john
forgive
me
if
i
pain
i
showed
not
my
feeling
to
others
when
it
would
wound
but
only
to
you
my
old
friend
whom
i
can
trust
if
you
could
have
looked
into
my
very
heart
then
when
i
want
to
laugh
if
you
could
have
done
so
when
the
laugh
arrived
if
you
could
do
so
now
when
king
laugh
have
pack
up
his
crown

all
that
is
to
himfor
he
go
far
far
away
from
me
and
for
a
long
long
timemaybe
you
would
perhaps
pity
me
the
most
of
all
i
was
touched
by
the
tenderness
of
his
tone
and
asked
why
because
i
know
and
now
we
are
all
scattered
and
for
many
a
long
day
loneliness
will
sit
over
our
roofs

brooding
wings

25
september
a
hampstead
mystery
the
neighbourhood
of
hampstead
is
just
at
present
exercised
with
a
series
of
events
which
seem
to
run
on
lines
parallel
to
those
of
what
was
known
to
the
writers
of
headlines
as
the
kensington
horror
or
the
stabbing
woman
or
the
woman
in
black
during
the
past
two
or
three
days
several
cases
have
occurred
of
young
children
straying
from
home
or
neglecting
to
return
from
their
playing
on
the
heath
in
all
these
cases
the
children
were
too
young
to
give
any
properly
intelligible
account
of
themselves
but
the
consensus
of
their
excuses
is
that
they
had
been
with
a
bloofer
lady
it
has
always
been
late
in
the
evening
when
they
have
been
missed
and
on
two
occasions
the
children
have
not
been
found
until
early
in
the
following
morning
it
is
generally
supposed
in
the
neighbourhood
that
as
the
first
child
missed
gave
as
his
reason
for
being
away
that
a
bloofer
lady
had
asked
him
to
come
for
a
walk
the
others
had
picked
up
the
phrase
and
used
it
as
occasion
served
this
is
the
more
natural
as
the
favourite
game
of
the
little
ones
at
present
is
luring
each
other
away
by
wiles
a
correspondent
writes
us
that
to
see
some
of
the
tiny
tots
pretending
to
be
the
bloofer
lady
is
supremely
funny
some
of
our
caricaturists
might
he
says
take
a
lesson
in
the
irony
of
grotesque
by
comparing
the
reality
and
the
picture
it
is
only
in
accordance
with
general
principles
of
human
nature
that
the
bloofer
lady
should
be
the
popular
rle
at
these
al
fresco
performances
our
correspondent
navely
says
that
even
ellen
terry
could
not
be
so
winningly
attractive
as
some
of
these
grubbyfaced
little
children
pretendand
even
imagine
themselvesto
be
there
is
however
possibly
a
serious
side
to
the
question
for
some
of
the
children
indeed
all
who
have
been
missed
at
night
have
been
slightly
torn
or
wounded
in
the
throat
the
wounds
seem
such
as
might
be
made
by
a
rat
or
a
small
dog
and
although
of
not
much
importance
individually
would

septemberjonathan
is
better
after
a
bad
night
i
am
so
glad
that
he
has
plenty
of
work
to
do
for
that
keeps
his
mind
off
the
terrible
things
and
oh
i
am
rejoiced
that
he
is
not
now
weighed
down
with
the
responsibility
of
his
new
position
i
knew
he
would
be
true
to
himself
and
now
how
proud
i
am
to
see
my
jonathan
rising
to
the
height
of
his
advancement
and
keeping
pace
in
all
ways
with
the
duties
that
come
upon
him
he
will
be
away
all
day
till
late
for
he
said
he
could
not
lunch
at
home
my
household
work
is
done
so
i
shall
take
his
foreign
journal
and
lock
myself
up
in
my
room
and
read
it
24
septemberi
hadnt
the
heart
to
write
last
night
that
terrible
record
of
jonathans
upset
me
so
poor
dear
how
he
must
have
suffered
whether
it
be
true
or
only
imagination
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
truth
in
it
at
all
did
he
get
his
brain
fever
and
then
write
all
those
terrible
things
or
had
he
some
cause
for
it
all
i
suppose
i
shall
never
know
for
i
dare
not
open
the
subject
to
him
and
yet
that
man
we
saw
yesterday
he
seemed
quite
certain
of
him
poor
fellow
i
suppose
it
was
the
funeral
upset
him
and
sent
his
mind
back
on
some
train
of
thought
he
believes
it
all
himself
i
remember
how
on
our
weddingday
he
said
unless
some
solemn
duty
come
upon
me
to
go
back
to
the
bitter
hours
asleep
or
awake
mad
or
sane
there
seems
to
be
through
it
all
some
thread
of
continuity
that
fearful
count
was
coming
to
london
if
it
should
be
and
he
came
to
london
with
his
teeming
millions
there
may
be
a
solemn
duty
and
if
it
come
we
must
not
shrink
from
it
i
shall
be
prepared
i
shall
get
my
typewriter
this
very
hour
and
begin
transcribing
then
we
shall
be
ready
for
other
eyes
if
required
and
if
it
be
wanted
then
perhaps
if
i
am
ready
poor
jonathan
may
not
be
upset
for
i
can
speak
for
him
and
never
let
him
be
troubled
or
worried
with
it
at
all
if
ever
jonathan
quite
gets
over
the
nervousness
he
may
want
to
tell
me
of
it
all
and
i
can
ask
him
questions
and
find
out
things
and
see
how
i
may
comfort
him

septemberi
cannot
help
feeling
terribly
excited
as
the
time
draws
near
for
the
visit
of
dr
van
helsing
for
somehow
i
expect
that
it
will
throw
some
light
upon
jonathans
sad
experience
and
as
he
attended
poor
dear
lucy
in
her
last
illness
he
can
tell
me
all
about
her
that
is
the
reason
of
his
coming
it
is
concerning
lucy
and
her
sleepwalking
and
not
about
jonathan
then
i
shall
never
know
the
real
truth
now
how
silly
i
am
that
awful
journal
gets
hold
of
my
imagination
and
tinges
everything
with
something
of
its
own
colour
of
course
it
is
about
lucy
that
habit
came
back
to
the
poor
dear
and
that
awful
night
on
the
cliff
must
have
made
her
ill
i
had
almost
forgotten
in
my
own
affairs
how
ill
she
was
afterwards
she
must
have
told
him
of
her
sleepwalking
adventure
on
the
cliff
and
that
i
knew
all
about
it
and
now
he
wants
me
to
tell
him
what
she
knows
so
that
he
may
understand
i
hope
i
did
right
in
not
saying
anything
of
it
to
mrs
westenra
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
any
act
of
mine
were
it
even
a
negative
one
brought
harm
on
poor
dear
lucy
i
hope
too
dr
van
helsing
will
not
blame
me
i
have
had
so
much
trouble
and
anxiety
of
late
that
i
feel
i
cannot
bear
more
just
at
present
i
suppose
a
cry
does
us
all
good
at
timesclears
the
air
as
other
rain
does
perhaps
it
was
reading
the
journal
yesterday
that
upset
me
and
then
jonathan
went
away
this
morning
to
stay
away
from
me
a
whole
day
and
night
the
first
time
we
have
been
parted
since
our
marriage
i
do
hope
the
dear
fellow
will
take
care
of
himself
and
that
nothing
will
occur
to
upset
him
it
is
two
oclock
and
the
doctor
will
be
here
soon
now
i
shall
say
nothing
of
jonathans
journal
unless
he
asks
me
i
am
so
glad
i
have
typewritten
out
my
own
journal
so
that
in
case
he
asks
about
lucy
i
can
hand
it
to
him
it
will
save
much
questioning





laterhe
has
come
and
gone
oh
what
a
strange
meeting
and
how
it
all
makes
my
head
whirl
round
i
feel
like
one
in
a
dream
can
it
be
all
possible
or
even
a
part
of
it
if
i
had
not
read
jonathans
journal
first
i
should
never
have
accepted
even
a
possibility
poor
poor
dear
jonathan
how
he
must
have
suffered
please
the
good
god
all
this
may
not
upset
him
again
i
shall
try
to
save
him
from
it
but
it
may
be
even
a
consolation
and
a
help
to
himterrible
though
it
be
and
awful
in
its
consequencesto
know
for
certain
that
his
eyes
and
ears
and
brain
did
not
deceive
him
and
that
it
is
all
true
it
may
be
that
it
is
the
doubt
which
haunts
him
that
when
the
doubt
is
removed
no
matter
whichwaking
or
dreamingmay
prove
the
truth
he
will
be
more
satisfied
and
better
able
to
bear
the
shock
dr
van
helsing
must
be
a
good
man
as
well
as
a
clever
one
if
he
is
arthurs
friend
and
dr
sewards
and
if
they
brought
him
all
the
way
from
holland
to
look
after
lucy
i
feel
from
having
seen
him
that
he
is
good
and
kind
and
of
a
noble
nature
when
he
comes
tomorrow
i
shall
ask
him
about
jonathan
and
then
please
god
all
this
sorrow
and
anxiety
may
lead
to
a
good
end
i
used
to
think
i
would
like
to
practise
interviewing
jonathans
friend
on
the
exeter
news
told
him
that
memory
was
everything
in
such
workthat
you
must
be
able
to
put
down
exactly
almost
every
word
spoken
even
if
you
had
to
refine
some
of
it
afterwards
here
was
a
rare
interview
i
shall
try
to
record
it
verbatim
it
was
halfpast
two
oclock
when
the
knock
came
i
took
my
courage

deux
mains
and
waited
in
a
few
minutes
mary
opened
the
door
and
announced
dr
van
helsing
i
rose
and
bowed
and
he
came
towards
me
a
man
of
medium
weight
strongly
built
with
his
shoulders
set
back
over
a
broad
deep
chest
and
a
neck
well
balanced
on
the
trunk
as
the
head
is
on
the
neck
the
poise
of
the
head
strikes
one
at
once
as
indicative
of
thought
and
power
the
head
is
noble
wellsized
broad
and
large
behind
the
ears
the
face
cleanshaven
shows
a
hard
square
chin
a
large
resolute
mobile
mouth
a
goodsized
nose
rather
straight
but
with
quick
sensitive
nostrils
that
seem
to
broaden
as
the
big
bushy
brows
come
down
and
the
mouth
tightens
the
forehead
is
broad
and
fine
rising
at
first
almost
straight
and
then
sloping
back
above
two
bumps
or
ridges
wide
apart
such
a
forehead
that
the
reddish
hair
cannot
possibly
tumble
over
it
but
falls
naturally
back
and
to
the
sides
big
dark
blue
eyes
are
set
widely
apart
and
are
quick
and
tender
or
stern
with
the
mans
moods
he
said
to
me
mrs
harker
is
it
not
i
bowed
assent
that
was
miss
mina
murray
again
i
assented
it
is
mina
murray
that
i
came
to
see
that
was
friend
of
that
poor
dear
child
lucy
westenra
madam
mina
it
is
on
account
of
the
dead
i
come
sir
i
said
you
could
have
no
better
claim
on
me
than
that
you
were
a
friend
and
helper
of
lucy
westenra
and
i
held
out
my
hand
he
took
it
and
said
tenderly
oh
madam
mina
i
knew
that
the
friend
of
that
poor
lily
girl
must
be
good
but
i
had
yet
to
learn
he
finished
his
speech
with
a
courtly
bow
i
asked
him
what
it
was
that
he
wanted
to
see
me
about
so
he
at
once
began
i
have
read
your
letters
to
miss
lucy
forgive
me
but
i
had
to
begin
to
inquire
somewhere
and
there
was
none
to
ask
i
know
that
you
were
with
her
at
whitby
she
sometimes
kept
a
diaryyou
need
not
look
surprised
madam
mina
it
was
begun
after
you
had
left
and
was
in
imitation
of
youand
in
that
diary
she
traces
by
inference
certain
things
to
a
sleepwalking
in
which
she
puts
down
that
you
saved
her
in
great
perplexity
then
i
come
to
you
and
ask
you
out
of
your
so
much
kindness
to
tell
me
all
of
it
that
you
can
remember
i
can
tell
you
i
think
dr
van
helsing
all
about
it
ah
then
you
have
good
memory
for
facts
for
details
it
is
not
always
so
with
young
ladies
no
doctor
but
i
wrote
it
all
down
at
the
time
i
can
show
it
to
you
if
you
like
oh
madam
mina
i
will
be
grateful
you
will
do
me
much
favour
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
mystifying
him
a
biti
suppose
it
is
some
of
the
taste
of
the
original
apple
that
remains
still
in
our
mouthsso
i
handed
him
the
shorthand
diary
he
took
it
with
a
grateful
bow
and
said
may
i
read
it
if
you
wish
i
answered
as
demurely
as
i
could
he
opened
it
and
for
an
instant
his
face
fell
then
he
stood
up
and
bowed
oh
you
so
clever
woman
he
said
i
knew
long
that
mr
jonathan
was
a
man
of
much
thankfulness
but
see
his
wife
have
all
the
good
things
and
will
you
not
so
much
honour
me
and
so
help
me
as
to
read
it
for
me
alas
i
know
not
the
shorthand
by
this
time
my
little
joke
was
over
and
i
was
almost
ashamed
so
i
took
the
typewritten
copy
from
my
workbasket
and
handed
it
to
him
forgive
me
i
said
i
could
not
help
it
but
i
had
been
thinking
that
it
was
of
dear
lucy
that
you
wished
to
ask
and
so
that
you
might
not
have
time
to
waitnot
on
my
account
but
because
i
know
your
time
must
be
preciousi
have
written
it
out
on
the
typewriter
for
you
he
took
it
and
his
eyes
glistened
you
are
so
good
he
said
and
may
i
read
it
now
i
may
want
to
ask
you
some
things
when
i
have
read
by
all
means
i
said
read
it
over
whilst
i
order
lunch
and
then
you
can
ask
me
questions
whilst
we
eat
he
bowed
and
settled
himself
in
a
chair
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
became
absorbed
in
the
papers
whilst
i
went
to
see
after
lunch
chiefly
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
when
i
came
back
i
found
him
walking
hurriedly
up
and
down
the
room
his
face
all
ablaze
with
excitement
he
rushed
up
to
me
and
took
me
by
both
hands
oh
madam
mina
he
said
how
can
i
say
what
i
owe
to
you
this
paper
is
as
sunshine
it
opens
the
gate
to
me
i
am
daze
i
am
dazzle
with
so
much
light
and
yet
clouds
roll
in
behind
the
light
every
time
but
that
you

not

my
life

and
women
i
who
have
made
my
specialty
the
brain
and
all
that
belongs
to
him
and
all
that
follow
from
him
and
i
have
read
your
diary
that
you
have
so
goodly
written
for
me
and
which
breathes
out
truth
in
every
line
i
who
have
read
your
so
sweet
letter
to
poor
lucy
of
your
marriage
and
your
trust
not

you
oh
madam
mina
good
women
tell
all
their
lives
and
by
day
and
by
hour
and
by
minute
such
things
that
angels
can
read
and
we
men
who
wish
to
know
have
in
us
something
of
angels
eyes
your
husband
is
noble
nature
and
you
are
noble
too
for
you
trust
and
trust
cannot
be
where
there
is
mean
nature
and
your
husbandtell
me
of
him
is
he
quite
well
is
all
that
fever
gone
and
is
he
strong
and
hearty
i
saw
here
an
opening
to
ask
him
about
jonathan
so
i
said
he
was
almost
recovered
but
he
has
been
greatly
upset
by
mr
hawkinss
death
he
interrupted
oh
yes
i
know
i
know
i
have
read
your
last
two
letters
i
went
on
i
suppose
this
upset
him
for
when
we
were
in
town
on
thursday
last
he
had
a
sort
of
shock
a
shock
and
after
brain
fever
so
soon
that
was
not
good
what
kind
of
a
shock
was
it
he
thought
he
saw
some
one
who
recalled
something
terrible
something
which
led
to
his
brain
fever
and
here
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
overwhelm
me
in
a
rush
the
pity
for
jonathan
the
horror
which
he
experienced
the
whole
fearful
mystery
of
his
diary
and
the
fear
that
has
been
brooding
over
me
ever
since
all
came
in
a
tumult
i
suppose
i
was
hysterical
for
i
threw
myself
on
my
knees
and
held
up
my
hands
to
him
and
implored
him
to
make
my
husband
well
again
he
took
my
hands
and
raised
me
up
and
made
me
sit
on
the
sofa
and
sat
by
me
he
held
my
hand
in
his
and
said
to
me
with
oh
such
infinite
sweetness
my
life
is
a
barren
and
lonely
one
and
so
full
of
work
that
i
have
not
had
much
time
for
friendships
but
since
i
have
been
summoned
to
here
by
my
friend
john
seward
i
have
known
so
many
good
people
and
seen
such
nobility
that
i
feel
more
than
everand
it
has
grown
with
my
advancing
yearsthe
loneliness
of
my
life
believe
me
then
that
i
come
here
full
of
respect
for
you
and
you
have
given
me
hopehope
not
in
what
i
am
seeking
of
but
that
there
are
good
women
still
left
to
make
life
happygood
women
whose
lives
and
whose
truths
may
make
good
lesson
for
the
children
that
are
to
be
i
am
glad
glad
that
i
may
here
be
of
some
use
to
you
for
if
your
husband
suffer
he
suffer
within
the
range
of
my
study
and
experience
i
promise
you
that
i
will
gladly
do
all
for
him
that
i
canall
to
make
his
life
strong
and
manly
and
your
life
a
happy
one
now
you
must
eat
you
are
overwrought
and
perhaps
overanxious
husband
jonathan
would
not
like
to
see
you
so
pale
and
what
he
like
not
where
he
love
is
not
to
his
good
therefore
for
his
sake
you
must
eat
and
smile
you
have
told
me
all
about
lucy
and
so
now
we
shall
not
speak
of
it
lest
it
distress
i
shall
stay
in
exeter
tonight
for
i
want
to
think
much
over
what
you
have
told
me
and
when
i
have
thought
i
will
ask
you
questions
if
i
may
and
then
too
you
will
tell
me
of
husband
jonathans
trouble
so
far
as
you
can
but
not
yet
you
must
eat
now
afterwards
you
shall
tell
me
all
after
lunch
when
we
went
back
to
the
drawingroom
he
said
to
me
and
now
tell
me
all
about
him
when
it
came
to
speaking
to
this
great
learned
man
i
began
to
fear
that
he
would
think
me
a
weak
fool
and
jonathan
a
madmanthat
journal
is
all
so
strangeand
i
hesitated
to
go
on
but
he
was
so
sweet
and
kind
and
he
had
promised
to
help
and
i
trusted
him
so
i
said
dr
van
helsing
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
so
queer
that
you
must
not
laugh
at
me
or
at
my
husband
i
have
been
since
yesterday
in
a
sort
of
fever
of
doubt
you
must
be
kind
to
me
and
not
think
me
foolish
that
i
have
even
half
believed
some
very
strange
things
he
reassured
me
by
his
manner
as
well
as
his
words
when
he
said
oh
my
dear
if
you
only
know
how
strange
is
the
matter
regarding
which
i
am
here
it
is
you
who
would
laugh
i
have
learned
not
to
think
little
of
any
ones
belief
no
matter
how
strange
it
be
i
have
tried
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
it
is
not
the
ordinary
things
of
life
that
could
close
it
but
the
strange
things
the
extraordinary
things
the
things
that
make
one
doubt
if
they
be
mad
or
sane
thank
you
thank
you
a
thousand
times
you
have
taken
a
weight
off
my
mind
if
you
will
let
me
i
shall
give
you
a
paper
to
read
it
is
long
but
i
have
typewritten
it
out
it
will
tell
you
my
trouble
and
jonathans
it
is
the
copy
of
his
journal
when
abroad
and
all
that
happened
i
dare
not
say
anything
of
it
you
will
read
for
yourself
and
judge
and
then
when
i
see
you
perhaps
you
will
be
very
kind
and
tell
me
what
you
think
i
promise
he
said
as
i
gave
him
the
papers
i
shall
in
the
morning
so
soon
as
i
can
come
to
see
you
and
your
husband
if
i
may
jonathan
will
be
here
at
halfpast
eleven
and
you
must
come
to
lunch
with
us
and
see
him
then
you
could
catch
the
quick
334
train
which
will
leave
you
at
paddington
before
eight
he
was
surprised
at
my
knowledge
of
the
trains
offhand
but
he
does
not
know
that
i
have
made
up
all
the
trains
to
and
from
exeter
so
that
i
may
help
jonathan
in
case
he
is
in
a
hurry
so
he
took
the
papers
with
him
and
went
away
and
i
sit
here

wall
and
to
that
roomay
and
going
a
second

septemberi
thought
never
to
write
in
this
diary
again
but
the
time
has
come
when
i
got
home
last
night
mina
had
supper
ready
and
when
we
had
supped
she
told
me
of
van
helsings
visit
and
of
her
having
given
him
the
two
diaries
copied
out
and
of
how
anxious
she
has
been
about
me
she
showed
me
in
the
doctors
letter
that
all
i
wrote
down
was
true
it
seems
to
have
made
a
new
man
of
me
it
was
the
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
the
whole
thing
that
knocked
me
over
i
felt
impotent
and
in
the
dark
and
distrustful
but
now
that
i
know
i
am
not
afraid
even
of
the
count
he
has
succeeded
after
all
then
in
his
design
in
getting
to
london
and
it
was
he
i
saw
he
has
got
younger
and
how
van
helsing
is
the
man
to
unmask
him
and
hunt
him
out
if
he
is
anything
like
what
mina
says
we
sat
late
and
talked
it
all
over
mina
is
dressing
and
i
shall
call
at
the
hotel
in
a
few
minutes
and
bring
him
over
he
was
i
think
surprised
to
see
me
when
i
came
into
the
room
where
he
was
and
introduced
myself
he
took
me
by
the
shoulder
and
turned
my
face
round
to
the
light
and
said
after
a
sharp
scrutiny
but
madam
mina
told
me
you
were
ill
that
you
had
had
a
shock
it
was
so
funny
to
hear
my
wife
called
madam
mina
by
this
kindly
strongfaced
old
man
i
smiled
and
said
i
was
ill
i
have
had
a
shock
but
you
have
cured
me
already
and
how
by
your
letter
to
mina
last
night
i
was
in
doubt
and
then
everything
took
a
hue
of
unreality
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
trust
even
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
not
knowing
what
to
trust
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
so
had
only
to
keep
on
working
in
what
had
hitherto
been
the
groove
of
my
life
the
groove
ceased
to
avail
me
and
i
mistrusted
myself
doctor
you
dont
know
what
it
is
to
doubt
everything
even
yourself
no
you
dont
you
couldnt
with
eyebrows
like
yours
he
seemed
pleased
and
laughed
as
he
said
so
you
are
physiognomist
i
learn
more
here
with
each
hour
i
am
with
so
much
pleasure
coming
to
you
to
breakfast
and
oh
sir
you
will
pardon
praise
from
an
old
man
but
you
are
blessed
in
your
wife
i
would
listen
to
him
go
on
praising
mina
for
a
day
so
i
simply
nodded
and
stood
silent
she
is
one
of
gods
women
fashioned
by
his
own
hand
to
show
us
men
and
other
women
that
there
is
a
heaven
where
we
can
enter
and
that
its
light
can
be
here
on
earth
so
true
so
sweet
so
noble
so
little
an
egoistand
that
let
me
tell
you
is
much
in
this
age
so
sceptical
and
selfish
and
you
siri
have
read
all
the
letters
to
poor
miss
lucy
and
some
of
them
speak
of
you
so
i
know
you
since
some
days
from
the
knowing
of
others
but
i
have
seen
your
true
self
since
last
night
you
will
give
me
your
hand
will
you
not
and
let
us
be
friends
for
all
our
lives
we
shook
hands
and
he
was
so
earnest
and
so
kind
that
it
made
me
quite
choky
and
now
he
said
may
i
ask
you
for
some
more
help
i
have
a
great
task
to
do
and
at
the
beginning
it
is
to
know
you
can
help
me
here
can
you
tell
me
what
went
before
your
going
to
transylvania
later
on
i
may
ask
more
help
and
of
a
different
kind
but
at
first
this
will
do
look
here
sir
i
said
does
what
you
have
to
do
concern
the
count
it
does
he
said
solemnly
then
i
am
with
you
heart
and
soul
as
you
go
by
the
1030
train
you
will
not
have
time
to
read
them
but
i
shall
get
the
bundle
of
papers
you
can
take
them
with
you
and
read
them
in
the
train
after
breakfast
i
saw
him
to
the
station
when
we
were
parting
he
said
perhaps
you
will
come
to
town
if
i
send
to
you
and
take
madam
mina
too
we
shall
both
come
when
you
will
i
said
i
had
got
him
the
morning
papers
and
the
london
papers
of
the
previous
night
and
while
we
were
talking
at
the
carriage
window
waiting
for
the
train
to
start
he
was
turning
them
over
his
eyes
suddenly
seemed
to
catch
something
in
one
of
them
the
westminster
gazettei
knew
it
by
the
colourand
he
grew
quite
white
he
read
something
intently
groaning
to
himself
mein
gott
mein
gott
so
soon
so
soon
i
do
not
think
he
remembered
me
at
the
moment
just
then
the
whistle
blew
and
the
train
moved
off
this
recalled
him
to
himself
and
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
waved
his
hand
calling
out
love
to
madam
mina
i
shall
write
so
soon
as
ever
i
can
dr
sewards
diary
26
septembertruly
there
is
no
such
thing
as
finality
not
a
week
since
i
said
finis
and
yet
here
i
am
starting
fresh
again
or
rather
going
on
with
the
same
record
until
this
afternoon
i
had
no
cause
to
think
of
what
is
done
renfield
had
become
to
all
intents
as
sane
as
he
ever
was
he
was
already
well
ahead
with
his
fly
business
and
he
had
just
started
in
the
spider
line
also
so
he
had
not
been
of
any
trouble
to
me
i
had
a
letter
from
arthur
written
on
sunday
and
from
it
i
gather
that
he
is
bearing
up
wonderfully
well
quincey
morris
is
with
him
and
that
is
much
of
a
help
for
he
himself
is
a
bubbling
well
of
good
spirits
quincey
wrote
me
a
line
too
and
from
him
i
hear
that
arthur
is
beginning
to
recover
something
of
his
old
buoyancy
so
as
to
them
all
my
mind
is
at
rest
as
for
myself
i
was
settling
down
to
my
work
with
the
enthusiasm
which
i
used
to
have
for
it
so
that
i
might
fairly
have
said
that
the
wound
which
poor
lucy
left
on
me
was
becoming
cicatrised
everything
is
however
now
reopened
and
what
is
to
be
the
end
god
only
knows
i
have
an
idea
that
van
helsing
thinks
he
knows
too
but
he
will
only
let
out
enough
at
a
time
to
whet
curiosity
he
went
to
exeter
yesterday
and
stayed
there
all
night
today
he
came
back
and
almost
bounded
into
the
room
at
about
halfpast
five
oclock
and
thrust
last
nights
westminster
gazette
into
my
hand
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
asked
as
he
stood
back
and
folded
his
arms
i
looked
over
the
paper
for
i
really
did
not
know
what
he
meant
but
he
took
it
from
me
and
pointed
out
a
paragraph
about
children
being
decoyed
away
at
hampstead
it
did
not
convey
much
to
me
until
i
reached
a
passage
where
it
described
small
punctured
wounds
on
their
throats
an
idea
struck
me
and
i
looked
up
well
he
said
it
is
like
poor
lucys
and
what
do
you
make
of
it
simply
that
there
is
some
cause
in
common
whatever
it
was
that
injured
her
has
injured
them
i
did
not
quite
understand
his
answer
that
is
true
indirectly
but
not
directly
how
do
you
mean
professor
i
asked
i
was
a
little
inclined
to
take
his
seriousness
lightlyfor
after
all
four
days
of
rest
and
freedom
from
burning
harrowing
anxiety
does
help
to
restore
ones
spiritsbut
when
i
saw
his
face
it
sobered
me
never
even
in
the
midst
of
our
despair
about
poor
lucy
had
he
looked
more
stern
tell
me
i
said
i
can
hazard
no
opinion
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
and
i
have
no
data
on
which
to
found
a
conjecture
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
friend
john
that
you
have
no
suspicion
as
to
what
poor
lucy
died
of
not
after
all
the
hints
given
not
only
by
events
but
by
me
of
nervous
prostration
following
on
great
loss
or
waste
of
blood
and
how
the
blood
lost
or
waste
i
shook
my
head
he
stepped
over
and
sat
down
beside
me
and
went
on
you
are
clever
man
friend
john
you
reason
well
and
your
wit
is
bold
but
you
are
too
prejudiced
you
do
not
let
your
eyes
see
nor
your
ears
hear
and
that
which
is
outside
your
daily
life
is
not
of
account
to
you
do
you
not
think
that
there
are
things
which
you
cannot
understand
and
yet
which
are
that
some
people
see
things
that
others
cannot
but
there
are
things
old
and
new
which
must
not
be
contemplate
by
mens
eyes
because
they
knowor
think
they
knowsome
things
which
other
men
have
told
them
ah
it
is
the
fault
of
our
science
that
it
wants
to
explain
all
and
if
it
explain
not
then
it
says
there
is
nothing
to
explain
but
yet
we
see
around
us
every
day
the
growth
of
new
beliefs
which
think
themselves
new
and
which
are
yet
but
the
old
which
pretend
to
be
younglike
the
fine
ladies
at
the
opera
i
suppose
now
you
do
not
believe
in
corporeal
transference
no
nor
in
materialisation
no
nor
in
astral
bodies
no
nor
in
the
reading
of
thought
no
nor
in
hypnotism
yes
i
said
charcot
has
proved
that
pretty
well
he
smiled
as
he
went
on
then
you
are
satisfied
as
to
it
yes
and
of
course
then
you
understand
how
it
act
and
can
follow
the
mind
of
the
great
charcotalas
that
he
is
no
moreinto
the
very
soul
of
the
patient
that
he
influence
no
then
friend
john
am
i
to
take
it
that
you
simply
accept
fact
and
are
satisfied
to
let
from
premise
to
conclusion
be
a
blank
no
then
tell
mefor
i
am
student
of
the
brainhow
you
accept
the
hypnotism
and
reject
the
thought
reading
let
me
tell
you
my
friend
that
there
are
things
done
today
in
electrical
science
which
would
have
been
deemed
unholy
by
the
very
men
who
discovered
electricitywho
would
themselves
not
so
long
before
have
been
burned
as
wizards
there
are
always
mysteries
in
life
why
was
it
that
methuselah
lived
nine
hundred
years
and
old
parr
one
hundred
and
sixtynine
and
yet
that
poor
lucy
with
four
mens
blood
in
her
poor
veins
could
not
live
even
one
day
for
had
she
live
one
more
day
we
could
have
save
her
do
you
know
all
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
do
you
know
the
altogether
of
comparative
anatomy
and
can
say
wherefore
the
qualities
of
brutes
are
in
some
men
and
not
in
others
can
you
tell
me
why
when
other
spiders
die
small
and
soon
that
one
great
spider
lived
for
centuries
in
the
tower
of
the
old
spanish
church
and
grew
and
grew
till
on
descending
he
could
drink
the
oil
of
all
the
church
lamps
can
you
tell
me
why
in
the
pampas
ay
and
elsewhere
there
are
bats
that
come
at
night
and
open
the
veins
of
cattle
and
horses
and
suck
dry
their
veins
how
in
some
islands
of
the
western
seas
there
are
bats
which
hang
on
the
trees
all
day
and
those
who
have
seen
describe
as
like
giant
nuts
or
pods
and
that
when
the
sailors
sleep
on
the
deck
because
that
it
is
hot
flit
down
on
them
and
thenand
then
in
the
morning
are
found
dead
men
white
as
even
miss
lucy
was
good
god
professor
i
said
starting
up
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
lucy
was
bitten
by
such
a
bat
and
that
such
a
thing
is
here
in
london
in
the
nineteenth
century
he
waved
his
hand
for
silence
and
went
on
can
you
tell
me
why
the
tortoise
lives
more
long
than
generations
of
men
why
the
elephant
goes
on
and
on
till
he
have
seen
dynasties
and
why
the
parrot
never
die
only
of
bite
of
cat
or
dog
or
other
complaint
can
you
tell
me
why
men
believe
in
all
ages
and
places
that
there
are
some
few
who
live
on
always
if
they
be
permit
that
there
are
men
and
women
who
cannot
die
we
all
knowbecause
science
has
vouched
for
the
factthat
there
have
been
toads
shut
up
in
rocks
for
thousands
of
years
shut
in
one
so
small
hole
that
only
hold
him
since
the
youth
of
the
world
can
you
tell
me
how
the
indian
fakir
can
make
himself
to
die
and
have
been
buried
and
his
grave
sealed
and
corn
sowed
on
it
and
the
corn
reaped
and
be
cut
and
sown
and
reaped
and
cut
again
and
then
men
come
and
take
away
the
unbroken
seal
and
that
there
lie
the
indian
fakir
not
dead
but
that
rise
up
and
walk
amongst
them
as
before
here
i
interrupted
him
i
was
getting
bewildered
he
so
crowded
on
my
mind
his
list
of
natures
eccentricities
and
possible
impossibilities
that
my
imagination
was
getting
fired
i
had
a
dim
idea
that
he
was
teaching
me
some
lesson
as
long
ago
he
used
to
do
in
his
study
at
amsterdam
but
he
used
then
to
tell
me
the
thing
so
that
i
could
have
the
object
of
thought
in
mind
all
the
time
but
now
i
was
without
this
help
yet
i
wanted
to
follow
him
so
i
said
professor
let
me
be
your
pet
student
again
tell
me
the
thesis
so
that
i
may
apply
your
knowledge
as
you
go
on
at
present
i
am
going
in
my
mind
from
point
to
point
as
a
mad
man
and
not
a
sane
one
follows
an
idea
i
feel
like
a
novice
lumbering
through
a
bog
in
a
mist
jumping
from
one
tussock
to
another
in
the
mere
blind
effort
to
move
on
without
knowing
where
i
am
going
that
is
good
image
he
said
well
i
shall
tell
you
my
thesis
is
this
i
want
you
to
believe
to
believe
what
to
believe
in
things
that
you
cannot
let
me
illustrate
i
heard
once
of
an
american
who
so
defined
faith
that
faculty
which
enables
us
to
believe
things
which
we
know
to
be
untrue
for
one
i
follow
that
man
he
meant
that
we
shall
have
an
open
mind
and
not
let
a
little
bit
of
truth
check
the
rush
of
a
big
truth
like
a
small
rock
does
a
railway
truck
we
get
the
small
truth
first
good
we
keep
him
and
we
value
him
but
all
the
same
we
must
not
let
him
think
himself
all
the
truth
in
the
universe
then
you
want
me
not
to
let
some
previous
conviction
injure
the
receptivity
of
my
mind
with
regard
to
some
strange
matter
do
i
read
your
lesson
aright
ah
you
are
my
favourite
pupil
still
it
is
worth
to
teach
you
now
that
you
are
willing
to
understand
you
have
taken
the
first
step
to
understand
you
think
then
that
those
so
small
holes
in
the
childrens
throats
were
made
by
the
same
that
made
the
hole
in
miss
lucy
i
suppose
so
he
stood
up
and
said
solemnly
then
you
are
wrong
oh
would
it
were
so
but
alas
no
it
is
worse
far
far
worse
in
gods
name
professor
van
helsing
what
do
you
mean
i
cried
he
threw
himself
with
a
despairing
gesture
into
a
chair
and
placed
his
elbows
on
the
table
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
as
he
spoke
they
were
made
by
miss
lucy
chapter
xv
dr
sewards
diarycontinued
for
a
while
sheer
anger
mastered
me
it
was
as
if
he
had
during
her
life
struck
lucy
on
the
face
i
smote
the
table
hard
and
rose
up
as
i
said
to
him
dr
van
helsing
are
you
mad
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
me
and
somehow
the
tenderness
of
his
face
calmed
me
at
once
would
i
were
he
said
madness
were
easy
to
bear
compared
with
truth
like
this
oh
my
friend
why
think
you
did
i
go
so
far
round
why
take
so
long
to
tell
you
so
simple
a
thing
was
it
because
i
hate
you
and
have
hated
you
all
my
life
was
it
because
i
wished
to
give
you
pain
was
it
that
i
wanted
now
so
late
revenge
for
that
time
when
you
saved
my
life
and
from
a
fearful
death
ah
no
forgive
me
said
i
he
went
on
my
friend
it
was
because
i
wished
to
be
gentle
in
the
breaking
to
you
for
i
know
you
have
loved
that
so
sweet
lady
but
even
yet
i
do
not
expect
you
to
believe
it
is
so
hard
to
accept
at
once
any
abstract
truth
that
we
may
doubt
such
to
be
possible
when
we
have
always
believed
the
no
of
it
it
is
more
hard
still
to
accept
so
sad
a
concrete
truth
and
of
such
a
one
as
miss
lucy
tonight
i
go
to
prove
it
dare
you
come
with
me
this
staggered
me
a
man
does
not
like
to
prove
such
a
truth
byron
excepted
from
the
category
jealousy
and
prove
the
very
truth
he
most
abhorred
he
saw
my
hesitation
and
spoke
the
logic
is
simple
no
madmans
logic
this
time
jumping
from
tussock
to
tussock
in
a
misty
bog
if
it
be
not
true
then
proof
will
be
relief
at
worst
it
will
not
harm
if
it
be
true
ah
there
is
the
dread
yet
very
dread
should
help
my
cause
for
in
it
is
some
need
of
belief
come
i
tell
you
what
i
propose
first
that
we
go
off
now
and
see
that
child
in
the
hospital
dr
vincent
of
the
north
hospital
where
the
papers
say
the
child
is
is
friend
of
mine
and
i
think
of
yours
since
you
were
in
class
at
amsterdam
he
will
let
two
scientists
see
his
case
if
he
will
not
let
two
friends
we
shall
tell
him
nothing
but
only
that
we
wish
to
learn
and
then
and
then
he
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
up
and
then
we
spend
the
night
you
and
i
in
the
churchyard
where
lucy
lies
this
is
the
key
that
lock
the
tomb
i
had
it
from
the
coffinman
to
give
to
arthur
my
heart
sank
within
me
for
i
felt
that
there
was
some
fearful
ordeal
before
us
i
could
do
nothing
however
so
i
plucked
up
what
heart
i
could
and
said
that
we
had
better
hasten
as
the
afternoon
was
passing
we
found
the
child
awake
it
had
had
a
sleep
and
taken
some
food
and
altogether
was
going
on
well
dr
vincent
took
the
bandage
from
its
throat
and
showed
us
the
punctures
there
was
no
mistaking
the
similarity
to
those
which
had
been
on
lucys
throat
they
were
smaller
and
the
edges
looked
fresher
that
was
all
we
asked
vincent
to
what
he
attributed
them
and
he
replied
that
it
must
have
been
a
bite
of
some
animal
perhaps
a
rat
but
for
his
own
part
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
one
of
the
bats
which
are
so
numerous
on
the
northern
heights
of
london
out
of
so
many
harmless
ones
he
said
there
may
be
some
wild
specimen
from
the
south
of
a
more
malignant
species
some
sailor
may
have
brought
one
home
and
it
managed
to
escape
or
even
from
the
zological
gardens
a
young
one
may
have
got
loose
or
one
be
bred
there
from
a
vampire
these
things
do
occur
you
know
only
ten
days
ago
a
wolf
got
out
and
was
i
believe
traced
up
in
this
direction
for
a
week
after
the
children
were
playing
nothing
but
red
riding
hood
on
the
heath
and
in
every
alley
in
the
place
until
this
bloofer
lady
scare
came
along
since
when
it
has
been
quite
a
galatime
with
them
even
this
poor
little
mite
when
he
woke
up
today
asked
the
nurse
if
he
might
go
away
when
she
asked
him
why
he
wanted
to
go
he
said
he
wanted
to
play
with
the
bloofer
lady
i
hope
said
van
helsing
that
when
you
are
sending
the
child
home
you
will
caution
its
parents
to
keep
strict
watch
over
it
these
fancies
to
stray
are
most
dangerous
and
if
the
child
were
to
remain
out
another
night
it
would
probably
be
fatal
but
in
any
case
i
suppose
you
will
not
let
it
away
for
some
days
certainly
not
not
for
a
week
at
least
longer
if
the
wound
is
not
healed
our
visit
to
the
hospital
took
more
time
than
we
had
reckoned
on
and
the
sun
had
dipped
before
we
came
out
when
van
helsing
saw
how
dark
it
was
he
said
there
is
no
hurry
it
is
more
late
than
i
thought
come
let
us
seek
somewhere
that
we
may
eat
and
then
we
shall
go
on
our
way
we
dined
at
jack
straws
castle
along
with
a
little
crowd
of
bicyclists
and
others
who
were
genially
noisy
about
ten
oclock
we
started
from
the
inn
it
was
then
very
dark
and
the
scattered
lamps
made
the
darkness
greater
when
we
were
once
outside
their
individual
radius
the
professor
had
evidently
noted
the
road
we
were
to
go
for
he
went
on
unhesitatingly
but
as
for
me
i
was
in
quite
a
mixup
as
to
locality
as
we
went
further
we
met
fewer
and
fewer
people
till
at
last
we
were
somewhat
surprised
when
we
met
even
the
patrol
of
horse
police
going
their
usual
suburban
round
at
last
we
reached
the
wall
of
the
churchyard
which
we
climbed
over
with
some
little
difficultyfor
it
was
very
dark
and
the
whole
place
seemed
so
strange
to
uswe
found
the
westenra
tomb
the
professor
took
the
key
opened
the
creaky
door
and
standing
back
politely
but
quite
unconsciously
motioned
me
to
precede
him
there
was
a
delicious
irony
in
the
offer
in
the
courtliness
of
giving
preference
on
such
a
ghastly
occasion
my
companion
followed
me
quickly
and
cautiously
drew
the
door
to
after
carefully
ascertaining
that
the
lock
was
a
falling
and
not
a
spring
one
in
the
latter
case
we
should
have
been
in
a
bad
plight
then
he
fumbled
in
his
bag
and
taking
out
a
matchbox
and
a
piece
of
candle
proceeded
to
make
a
light
the
tomb
in
the
daytime
and
when
wreathed
with
fresh
flowers
had
looked
grim
and
gruesome
enough
but
now
some
days
afterwards
when
the
flowers
hung
lank
and
dead
their
whites
turning
to
rust
and
their
greens
to
browns
when
the
spider
and
the
beetle
had
resumed
their
accustomed
dominance
when
timediscoloured
stone
and
dustencrusted
mortar
and
rusty
dank
iron
and
tarnished
brass
and
clouded
silverplating
gave
back
the
feeble
glimmer
of
a
candle
the
effect
was
more
miserable
and
sordid
than
could
have
been
imagined
it
conveyed
irresistibly
the
idea
that
lifeanimal
lifewas
not
the
only
thing
which
could
pass
away
van
helsing
went
about
his
work
systematically
holding
his
candle
so
that
he
could
read
the
coffin
plates
and
so
holding
it
that
the
sperm
dropped
in
white
patches
which
congealed
as
they
touched
the
metal
he
made
assurance
of
lucys
coffin
another
search
in
his
bag
and
he
took
out
a
turnscrew
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
asked
to
open
the
coffin
you
shall
yet
be
convinced
straightway
he
began
taking
out
the
screws
and
finally
lifted
off
the
lid
showing
the
casing
of
lead
beneath
the
sight
was
almost
too
much
for
me
it
seemed
to
be
as
much
an
affront
to
the
dead
as
it
would
have
been
to
have
stripped
off
her
clothing
in
her
sleep
whilst
living
i
actually
took
hold
of
his
hand
to
stop
him
he
only
said
you
shall
see
and
again
fumbling
in
his
bag
took
out
a
tiny
fretsaw
striking
the
turnscrew
through
the
lead
with
a
swift
downward
stab
which
made
me
wince
he
made
a
small
hole
which
was
however
big
enough
to
admit
the
point
of
the
saw
i
had
expected
a
rush
of
gas
from
the
weekold
corpse
we
doctors
who
have
had
to
study
our
dangers
have
to
become
accustomed
to
such
things
and
i
drew
back
towards
the
door
but
the
professor
never
stopped
for
a
moment
he
sawed
down
a
couple
of
feet
along
one
side
of
the
lead
coffin
and
then
across
and
down
the
other
side
taking
the
edge
of
the
loose
flange
he
bent
it
back
towards
the
foot
of
the
coffin
and
holding
up
the
candle
into
the
aperture
motioned
to
me
to
look
i
drew
near
and
looked
the
coffin
was
empty
it
was
certainly
a
surprise
to
me
and
gave
me
a
considerable
shock
but
van
helsing
was
unmoved
he
was
now
more
sure
than
ever
of
his
ground
and
so
emboldened
to
proceed
in
his
task
are
you
satisfied
now
friend
john
he
asked
i
felt
all
the
dogged
argumentativeness
of
my
nature
awake
within
me
as
i
answered
him
i
am
satisfied
that
lucys
body
is
not
in
that
coffin
but
that
only
proves
one
thing
and
what
is
that
friend
john
that
it
is
not
there
that
is
good
logic
he
said
so
far
as
it
goes
but
how
do
youhow
can
youaccount
for
it
not
being
there
perhaps
a
bodysnatcher
i
suggested
some
of
the
undertakers
people
may
have
stolen
it
i
felt
that
i
was
speaking
folly
and
yet
it
was
the
only
real
cause
which
i
could
suggest
the
professor
sighed
ah
well
he
said
we
must
have
more
proof
come
with
me
he
put
on
the
coffinlid
again
gathered
up
all
his
things
and
placed
them
in
the
bag
blew
out
the
light
and
placed
the
candle
also
in
the
bag
we
opened
the
door
and
went
out
behind
us
he
closed
the
door
and
locked
it
he
handed
me
the
key
saying
will
you
keep
it
you
had
better
be
assured
i
laughedit
was
not
a
very
cheerful
laugh
i
am
bound
to
sayas
i
motioned
him
to
keep
it
a
key
is
nothing
i
said
there
may
be
duplicates
and
anyhow
it
is
not
difficult
to
pick
a
lock
of
that
kind
he
said
nothing
but
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
then
he
told
me
to
watch
at
one
side
of
the
churchyard
whilst
he
would
watch
at
the
other
i
took
up
my
place
behind
a
yewtree
and
i
saw
his
dark
figure
move
until
the
intervening
headstones
and
trees
hid
it
from
my
sight
it
was
a
lonely
vigil
just
after
i
had
taken
my
place
i
heard
a
distant
clock
strike
twelve
and
in
time
came
one
and
two
i
was
chilled
and
unnerved
and
angry
with
the
professor
for
taking
me
on
such
an
errand
and
with
myself
for
coming
i
was
too
cold
and
too
sleepy
to
be
keenly
observant
and
not
sleepy
enough
to
betray
my
trust
so
altogether
i
had
a
dreary
miserable
time
suddenly
as
i
turned
round
i
thought
i
saw
something
like
a
white
streak
moving
between
two
dark
yewtrees
at
the
side
of
the
churchyard
farthest
from
the
tomb
at
the
same
time
a
dark
mass
moved
from
the
professors
side
of
the
ground
and
hurriedly
went
towards
it
then
i
too
moved
but
i
had
to
go
round
headstones
and
railedoff
tombs
and
i
stumbled
over
graves
the
sky
was
overcast
and
somewhere
far
off
an
early
cock
crew
a
little
way
off
beyond
a
line
of
scattered
junipertrees
which
marked
the
pathway
to
the
church
a
white
dim
figure
flitted
in
the
direction
of
the
tomb
the
tomb
itself
was
hidden
by
trees
and
i
could
not
see
where
the
figure
disappeared
i
heard
the
rustle
of
actual
movement
where
i
had
first
seen
the
white
figure
and
coming
over
found
the
professor
holding
in
his
arms
a
tiny
child
when
he
saw
me
he
held
it
out
to
me
and
said
are
you
satisfied
now
no
i
said
in
a
way
that
i
felt
was
aggressive
do
you
not
see
the
child
yes
it
is
a
child
but
who
brought
it
here
and
is
it
wounded
i
asked
we
shall
see
said
the
professor
and
with
one
impulse
we
took
our
way
out
of
the
churchyard
he
carrying
the
sleeping
child
when
we
had
got
some
little
distance
away
we
went
into
a
clump
of
trees
and
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
the
childs
throat
it
was
without
a
scratch
or
scar
of
any
kind
was
i
right
i
asked
triumphantly
we
were
just
in
time
said
the
professor
thankfully
we
had
now
to
decide
what
we
were
to
do
with
the
child
and
so
consulted
about
it
if
we
were
to
take
it
to
a
policestation
we
should
have
to
give
some
account
of
our
movements
during
the
night
at
least
we
should
have
had
to
make
some
statement
as
to
how
we
had
come
to
find
the
child
so
finally
we
decided
that
we
would
take
it
to
the
heath
and
when
we
heard
a
policeman
coming
would
leave
it
where
he
could
not
fail
to
find
it
we
would
then
seek
our
way
home
as
quickly
as
we
could
all
fell
out
well
at
the
edge
of
hampstead
heath
we
heard
a
policemans
heavy
tramp
and
laying
the
child
on
the
pathway
we
waited
and
watched
until
he
saw
it
as
he
flashed
his
lantern
to
and
fro
we
heard
his
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
then
we
went
away
silently
by
good
chance
we
got
a
cab
near
the
spaniards
and
drove
to
town
i
cannot
sleep
so
i
make
this
entry
but
i
must
try
to
get
a
few
hours
sleep
as
van
helsing
is
to
call
for
me
at
noon
he
insists
that
i
shall
go
with
him
on
another
expedition





27
septemberit
was
two
oclock
before
we
found
a
suitable
opportunity
for
our
attempt
the
funeral
held
at
noon
was
all
completed
and
the
last
stragglers
of
the
mourners
had
taken
themselves
lazily
away
when
looking
carefully
from
behind
a
clump
of
aldertrees
we
saw
the
sexton
lock
the
gate
after
him
we
knew
then
that
we
were
safe
till
morning
did
we
desire
it
but
the
professor
told
me
that
we
should
not
want
more
than
an
hour
at
most
again
i
felt
that
horrid
sense
of
the
reality
of
things
in
which
any
effort
of
imagination
seemed
out
of
place
and
i
realised
distinctly
the
perils
of
the
law
which
we
were
incurring
in
our
unhallowed
work
besides
i
felt
it
was
all
so
useless
outrageous
as
it
was
to
open
a
leaden
coffin
to
see
if
a
woman
dead
nearly
a
week
were
really
dead
it
now
seemed
the
height
of
folly
to
open
the
tomb
again
when
we
knew
from
the
evidence
of
our
own
eyesight
that
the
coffin
was
empty
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
however
and
rested
silent
for
van
helsing
had
a
way
of
going
on
his
own
road
no
matter
who
remonstrated
he
took
the
key
opened
the
vault
and
again
courteously
motioned
me
to
precede
the
place
was
not
so
gruesome
as
last
night
but
oh
how
unutterably
meanlooking
when
the
sunshine
streamed
in
van
helsing
walked
over
to
lucys
coffin
and
i
followed
he
bent
over
and
again
forced
back
the
leaden
flange
and
then
a
shock
of
surprise
and
dismay
shot
through
me
there
lay
lucy
seemingly
just
as
we
had
seen
her
the
night
before
her
funeral
she
was
if
possible
more
radiantly
beautiful
than
ever
and
i
could
not
believe
that
she
was
dead
the
lips
were
red
nay
redder
than
before
and
on
the
cheeks
was
a
delicate
bloom
is
this
a
juggle
i
said
to
him
are
you
convinced
now
said
the
professor
in
response
and
as
he
spoke
he
put
over
his
hand
and
in
a
way
that
made
me
shudder
pulled
back
the
dead
lips
and
showed
the
white
teeth
see
he
went
on
see
they
are
even
sharper
than
before
with
this
and
thisand
he
touched
one
of
the
canine
teeth
and
that
below
itthe
little
children
can
be
bitten
are
you
of
belief
now
friend
john
once
more
argumentative
hostility
woke
within
me
i
could
not
accept
such
an
overwhelming
idea
as
he
suggested
so
with
an
attempt
to
argue
of
which
i
was
even
at
the
moment
ashamed
i
said
she
may
have
been
placed
here
since
last
night
indeed
that
is
so
and
by
whom
i
do
not
know
some
one
has
done
it
and
yet
she
has
been
dead
one
week
most
peoples
in
that
time
would
not
look
so
i
had
no
answer
for
this
so
was
silent
van
helsing
did
not
seem
to
notice
my
silence
at
any
rate
he
showed
neither
chagrin
nor
triumph
he
was
looking
intently
at
the
face
of
the
dead
woman
raising
the
eyelids
and
looking
at
the
eyes
and
once
more
opening
the
lips
and
examining
the
teeth
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
here
there
is
one
thing
which
is
different
from
all
recorded
here
is
some
dual
life
that
is
not
as
the
common
she
was
bitten
by
the
vampire
when
she
was
in
a
trance
sleepwalkingoh
you
start
you
do
not
know
that
friend
john
but
you
shall
know
it
all
laterand
in
trance
could
he
best
come
to
take
more
blood
in
trance
she
died
and
in
trance
she
is
undead
too
so
it
is
that
she
differ
from
all
other
usually
when
the
undead
sleep
at
homeas
he
spoke
he
made
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
his
arm
to
designate
what
to
a
vampire
was
hometheir
face
show
what
they
are
but
this
so
sweet
that
was
when
she
not
undead
she
go
back
to
the
nothings
of
the
common
dead
there
is
no
malign
there
see
and
so
it
make
hard
that
i
must
kill
her
in
her
sleep
this
turned
my
blood
cold
and
it
began
to
dawn
upon
me
that
i
was
accepting
van
helsings
theories
but
if
she
were
really
dead
what
was
there
of
terror
in
the
idea
of
killing
her
he
looked
up
at
me
and
evidently
saw
the
change
in
my
face
for
he
said
almost
joyously
ah
you
believe
now
i
answered
do
not
press
me
too
hard
all
at
once
i
am
willing
to
accept
how
will
you
do
this
bloody
work
i
shall
cut
off
her
head
and
fill
her
mouth
with
garlic
and
i
shall
drive
a
stake
through
her
body
it
made
me
shudder
to
think
of
so
mutilating
the
body
of
the
woman
whom
i
had
loved
and
yet
the
feeling
was
not
so
strong
as
i
had
expected
i
was
in
fact
beginning
to
shudder
at
the
presence
of
this
being
this
undead
as
van
helsing
called
it
and
to
loathe
it
is
it
possible
that
love
is
all
subjective
or
all
objective
i
waited
a
considerable
time
for
van
helsing
to
begin
but
he
stood
as
if
wrapped
in
thought
presently
he
closed
the
catch
of
his
bag
with
a
snap
and
said
i
have
been
thinking
and
have
made
up
my
mind
as
to
what
is
best
if
i
did
simply
follow
my
inclining
i
would
do
now
at
this
moment
what
is
to
be
done
but
there
are
other
things
to
follow
and
things
that
are
thousand
times
more
difficult
in
that
them
we
do
not
know
this
is
simple
she
have
yet
no
life
taken
though
that
is
of
time
and
to
act
now
would
be
to
take
danger
from
her
for
ever
but
then
we
may
have
to
want
arthur
and
how
shall
we
tell
him
of
this
if
you
who
saw
the
wounds
on
lucys
throat
and
saw
the
wounds
so
similar
on
the
childs
at
the
hospital
if
you
who
saw
the
coffin
empty
last
night
and
full
today
with
a
woman
who
have
not
change
only
to
be
more
rose
and
more
beautiful
in
a
whole
week
after
she
dieif
you
know
of
this
and
know
of
the
white
figure
last
night
that
brought
the
child
to
the
churchyard
and
yet
of
your
own
senses
you
did
not
believe
how
then
can
i
expect
arthur
who
know
none
of
those
things
to
believe
he
doubted
me
when
i
took
him
from
her
kiss
when
she
was
dying
i
know
he
has
forgiven
me
because
in
some
mistaken
idea
i
have
done
things
that
prevent
him
say
goodbye
as
he
ought
and
he
may
think
that
in
some
more
mistaken
idea
this
woman
was
buried
alive
and
that
in
most
mistake
of
all
we
have
killed
her
he
will
then
argue
back
that
it
is
we
mistaken
ones
that
have
killed
her
by
our
ideas
and
so
he
will
be
much
unhappy
always
yet
he
never
can
be
sure
and
that
is
the
worst
of
all
and
he
will
sometimes
think
that
she
he
loved
was
buried
alive
and
that
will
paint
his
dreams
with
horrors
of
what
she
must
have
suffered
and
again
he
will
think
that
we
may
be
right
and
that
his
so
beloved
was
after
all
an
undead
no
i
told
him
once
and
since
then
i
learn
much
now
since
i
know
it
is
all
true
a
hundred
thousand
times
more
do
i
know
that
he
must
pass
through
the
bitter
waters
to
reach
the
sweet
he
poor
fellow
must
have
one
hour
that
will
make
the
very
face
of
heaven
grow
black
to
him
then
we
can
act
for
good
all
round
and
send
him
peace
my
mind
is
made
up
let
us
go
you
return
home
for
tonight
to
your
asylum
and
see
that
all
be
well
as
for
me
i
shall
spend
the
night
here
in
this
churchyard
in
my
own
way
tomorrow
night
you
will
come
to
me
to
the
berkeley
hotel
at
ten
of
the
clock
i
shall
send
for
arthur
to
come
too
and
also
that
so
fine
young
man
of
america
that
gave
his
blood
later
we
shall
all
have
work
to
do
i
come
with
you
so
far
as
piccadilly
and
there
dine
for
i
must
be
back
here
before
the
sun
set
so
we
locked
the
tomb
and
came
away
and
got
over
the
wall
of
the
churchyard
which
was
not
much
of
a
task
and
drove
back
to
piccadilly

september
friend
john
i
write
this
in
case
anything
should
happen
i
go
alone
to
watch
in
that
churchyard
it
pleases
me
that
the
undead
miss
lucy
shall
not
leave
tonight
that
so
on
the
morrow
night
she
may
be
more
eager
therefore
i
shall
fix
some
things
she
like
notgarlic
and
a
crucifixand
so
seal
up
the
door
of
the
tomb
she
is
young
as
undead
and
will
heed
moreover
these
are
only
to
prevent
her
coming
out
they
may
not
prevail
on
her
wanting
to
get
in
for
then
the
undead
is
desperate
and
must
find
the
line
of
least
resistance
whatsoever
it
may
be
i
shall
be
at
hand
all
the
night
from
sunset
till
after
the
sunrise
and
if
there
be
aught
that
may
be
learned
i
shall
learn
it
for
miss
lucy
or
from
her
i
have
no
fear
but
that
other
to
whom
is
there
that
she
is
undead
he
have
now
the
power
to
seek
her
tomb
and
find
shelter
he
is
cunning
as
i
know
from
mr
jonathan
and
from
the
way
that
all
along
he
have
fooled
us
when
he
played
with
us
for
miss
lucys
life
and
we
lost
and
in
many
ways
the
undead
are
strong
he
have
always
the
strength
in
his
hand
of
twenty
men
even
we
four
who
gave
our
strength
to
miss
lucy
it
also
is
all
to
him
besides
he
can
summon
his
wolf
and
i
know
not
what
so
if
it
be
that
he
come
thither
on
this
night
he
shall
find
me
but
none
other
shalluntil
it
be
too
late
but
it
may
be
that
he
will
not
attempt
the
place
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
his
hunting
ground
is
more
full
of
game
than
the
churchyard
where
the
undead
woman
sleep
and
the
one
old
man
watch
therefore
i
write
this
in
case
take
the
papers
that
are
with
this
the
diaries
of
harker
and
the
rest
and
read
them
and
then
find
this
great
undead
and
cut
off
his
head
and
burn
his
heart
or
drive
a
stake
through
it
so
that
the
world
may
rest
from
him
if
it
be
so

28
septemberit
is
wonderful
what
a
good
nights
sleep
will
do
for
one
yesterday
i
was
almost
willing
to
accept
van
helsings
monstrous
ideas
but
now
they
seem
to
start
out
lurid
before
me
as
outrages
on
common
sense
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
believes
it
all
i
wonder
if
his
mind
can
have
become
in
any
way
unhinged
surely
there
must
be
some
rational
explanation
of
all
these
mysterious
things
is
it
possible
that
the
professor
can
have
done
it
himself
he
is
so
abnormally
clever
that
if
he
went
off
his
head
he
would
carry
out
his
intent
with
regard
to
some
fixed
idea
in
a
wonderful
way
i
am
loath
to
think
it
and
indeed
it
would
be
almost
as
great
a
marvel
as
the
other
to
find
that
van
helsing
was
mad
but
anyhow
i
shall
watch
him
carefully
i
may
get
some
light
on
the
mystery





29
september
morning
last
night
at
a
little
before
ten
oclock
arthur
and
quincey
came
into
van
helsings
room
he
told
us
all
that
he
wanted
us
to
do
but
especially
addressing
himself
to
arthur
as
if
all
our
wills
were
centred
in
his
he
began
by
saying
that
he
hoped
we
would
all
come
with
him
too
for
he
said
there
is
a
grave
duty
to
be
done
there
you
were
doubtless
surprised
at
my
letter
this
query
was
directly
addressed
to
lord
godalming
i
was
it
rather
upset
me
for
a
bit
there
has
been
so
much
trouble
around
my
house
of
late
that
i
could
do
without
any
more
i
have
been
curious
too
as
to
what
you
mean
quincey
and
i
talked
it
over
but
the
more
we
talked
the
more
puzzled
we
got
till
now
i
can
say
for
myself
that
im
about
up
a
tree
as
to
any
meaning
about
anything
me
too
said
quincey
morris
laconically
oh
said
the
professor
then
you
are
nearer
the
beginning
both
of
you
than
friend
john
here
who
has
to
go
a
long
way
back
before
he
can
even
get
so
far
as
to
begin
it
was
evident
that
he
recognised
my
return
to
my
old
doubting
frame
of
mind
without
my
saying
a
word
then
turning
to
the
other
two
he
said
with
intense
gravity
i
want
your
permission
to
do
what
i
think
good
this
night
it
is
i
know
much
to
ask
and
when
you
know
what
it
is
i
propose
to
do
you
will
know
and
only
then
how
much
therefore
may
i
ask
that
you
promise
me
in
the
dark
so
that
afterwards
though
you
may
be
angry
with
me
for
a
timei
must
not
disguise
from
myself
the
possibility
that
such
may
beyou
shall
not
blame
yourselves
for
anything
thats
frank
anyhow
broke
in
quincey
ill
answer
for
the
professor
i
dont
quite
see
his
drift
but
i
swear
hes
honest
and
thats
good
enough
for
me
i
thank
you
sir
said
van
helsing
proudly
i
have
done
myself
the
honour
of
counting
you
one
trusting
friend
and
such
endorsement
is
dear
to
me
he
held
out
a
hand
which
quincey
took
then
arthur
spoke
out
dr
van
helsing
i
dont
quite
like
to
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
as
they
say
in
scotland
and
if
it
be
anything
in
which
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
or
my
faith
as
a
christian
is
concerned
i
cannot
make
such
a
promise
if
you
can
assure
me
that
what
you
intend
does
not
violate
either
of
these
two
then
i
give
my
consent
at
once
though
for
the
life
of
me
i
cannot
understand
what
you
are
driving
at
i
accept
your
limitation
said
van
helsing
and
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
if
you
feel
it
necessary
to
condemn
any
act
of
mine
you
will
first
consider
it
well
and
be
satisfied
that
it
does
not
violate
your
reservations
agreed
said
arthur
that
is
only
fair
and
now
that
the
pourparlers
are
over
may
i
ask
what
it
is
we
are
to
do
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
and
to
come
in
secret
to
the
churchyard
at
kingstead
arthurs
face
fell
as
he
said
in
an
amazed
sort
of
way
where
poor
lucy
is
buried
the
professor
bowed
arthur
went
on
and
when
there
to
enter
the
tomb
arthur
stood
up
professor
are
you
in
earnest
or
it
is
some
monstrous
joke
pardon
me
i
see
that
you
are
in
earnest
he
sat
down
again
but
i
could
see
that
he
sat
firmly
and
proudly
as
one
who
is
on
his
dignity
there
was
silence
until
he
asked
again
and
when
in
the
tomb
to
open
the
coffin
this
is
too
much
he
said
angrily
rising
again
i
am
willing
to
be
patient
in
all
things
that
are
reasonable
but
in
thisthis
desecration
of
the
graveof
one
who
he
fairly
choked
with
indignation
the
professor
looked
pityingly
at
him
if
i
could
spare
you
one
pang
my
poor
friend
he
said
god
knows
i
would
but
this
night
our
feet
must
tread
in
thorny
paths
or
later
and
for
ever
the
feet
you
love
must
walk
in
paths
of
flame
arthur
looked
up
with
set
white
face
and
said
take
care
sir
take
care
would
it
not
be
well
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
said
van
helsing
and
then
you
will
at
least
know
the
limit
of
my
purpose
shall
i
go
on
thats
fair
enough
broke
in
morris
after
a
pause
van
helsing
went
on
evidently
with
an
effort
miss
lucy
is
dead
is
it
not
so
yes
then
there
can
be
no
wrong
to
her
but
if
she
be
not
dead
arthur
jumped
to
his
feet
good
god
he
cried
what
do
you
mean
has
there
been
any
mistake
has
she
been
buried
alive
he
groaned
in
anguish
that
not
even
hope
could
soften
i
did
not
say
she
was
alive
my
child
i
did
not
think
it
i
go
no
further
than
to
say
that
she
might
be
undead
undead
not
alive
what
do
you
mean
is
this
all
a
nightmare
or
what
is
it
there
are
mysteries
which
men
can
only
guess
at
which
age
by
age
they
may
solve
only
in
part
believe
me
we
are
now
on
the
verge
of
one
but
i
have
not
done
may
i
cut
off
the
head
of
dead
miss
lucy
heavens
and
earth
no
cried
arthur
in
a
storm
of
passion
not
for
the
wide
world
will
i
consent
to
any
mutilation
of
her
dead
body
dr
van
helsing
you
try
me
too
far
what
have
i
done
to
you
that
you
should
torture
me
so
what
did
that
poor
sweet
girl
do
that
you
should
want
to
cast
such
dishonour
on
her
grave
are
you
mad
to
speak
such
things
or
am
i
mad
to
listen
to
them
dont
dare
to
think
more
of
such
a
desecration
i
shall
not
give
my
consent
to
anything
you
do
i
have
a
duty
to
do
in
protecting
her
grave
from
outrage
and
by
god
i
shall
do
it
van
helsing
rose
up
from
where
he
had
all
the
time
been
seated
and
said
gravely
and
sternly
my
lord
godalming
i
too
have
a
duty
to
do
a
duty
to
others
a
duty
to
you
a
duty
to
the
dead
and
by
god
i
shall
do
it
all
i
ask
you
now
is
that
you
come
with
me
that
you
look
and
listen
and
if
when
later
i
make
the
same
request
you
do
not
be
more
eager
for
its
fulfilment
even
than
i
am
thenthen
i
shall
do
my
duty
whatever
it
may
seem
to
me
and
then
to
follow
of
your
lordships
wishes
i
shall
hold
myself
at
your
disposal
to
render
an
account
to
you
when
and
where
you
will
his
voice
broke
a
little
and
he
went
on
with
a
voice
full
of
pity
but
i
beseech
you
do
not
go
forth
in
anger
with
me
in
a
long
life
of
acts
which
were
often
not
pleasant
to
do
and
which
sometimes
did
wring
my
heart
i
have
never
had
so
heavy
a
task
as
now
believe
me
that
if
the
time
comes
for
you
to
change
your
mind
towards
me
one
look
from
you
will
wipe
away
all
this
so
sad
hour
for
i
would
do
what
a
man
can
to
save
you
from
sorrow
just
think
for
why
should
i
give
myself
so
much
of
labour
and
so
much
of
sorrow
i
have
come
here
from
my
own
land
to
do
what
i
can
of
good
at
the
first
to
please
my
friend
john
and
then
to
help
a
sweet
young
lady
whom
too
i
came
to
love
for
heri
am
ashamed
to
say
so
much
but
i
say
it
in
kindnessi
gave
what
you
gave
the
blood
of
my
veins
i
gave
it
i
who
was
not
like
you
her
lover
but
only
her
physician
and
her
friend
i
gave
to
her
my
nights
and
daysbefore
death
after
death
and
if
my
death
can
do
her
good
even
now
when
she
is
the
dead
undead
she
shall
have
it
freely
he
said
this
with
a
very
grave
sweet
pride
and
arthur
was
much
affected
by
it
he
took
the
old
mans
hand
and
said
in
a
broken
voice
oh
it
is
hard
to
think
of
it
and
i
cannot
understand
but
at
least
i
shall
go
with
you
and
wait

diarycontinued
it
was
just
a
quarter
before
twelve
oclock
when
we
got
into
the
churchyard
over
the
low
wall
the
night
was
dark
with
occasional
gleams
of
moonlight
between
the
rents
of
the
heavy
clouds
that
scudded
across
the
sky
we
all
kept
somehow
close
together
with
van
helsing
slightly
in
front
as
he
led
the
way
when
we
had
come
close
to
the
tomb
i
looked
well
at
arthur
for
i
feared
that
the
proximity
to
a
place
laden
with
so
sorrowful
a
memory
would
upset
him
but
he
bore
himself
well
i
took
it
that
the
very
mystery
of
the
proceeding
was
in
some
way
a
counteractant
to
his
grief
the
professor
unlocked
the
door
and
seeing
a
natural
hesitation
amongst
us
for
various
reasons
solved
the
difficulty
by
entering
first
himself
the
rest
of
us
followed
and
he
closed
the
door
he
then
lit
a
dark
lantern
and
pointed
to
the
coffin
arthur
stepped
forward
hesitatingly
van
helsing
said
to
me
you
were
with
me
here
yesterday
was
the
body
of
miss
lucy
in
that
coffin
it
was
the
professor
turned
to
the
rest
saying
you
hear
and
yet
there
is
no
one
who
does
not
believe
with
me
he
took
his
screwdriver
and
again
took
off
the
lid
of
the
coffin
arthur
looked
on
very
pale
but
silent
when
the
lid
was
removed
he
stepped
forward
he
evidently
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
leaden
coffin
or
at
any
rate
had
not
thought
of
it
when
he
saw
the
rent
in
the
lead
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
for
an
instant
but
as
quickly
fell
away
again
so
that
he
remained
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
he
was
still
silent
van
helsing
forced
back
the
leaden
flange
and
we
all
looked
in
and
recoiled
the
coffin
was
empty
for
several
minutes
no
one
spoke
a
word
the
silence
was
broken
by
quincey
morris
professor
i
answered
for
you
your
word
is
all
i
want
i
wouldnt
ask
such
a
thing
ordinarilyi
wouldnt
so
dishonour
you
as
to
imply
a
doubt
but
this
is
a
mystery
that
goes
beyond
any
honour
or
dishonour
is
this
your
doing
i
swear
to
you
by
all
that
i
hold
sacred
that
i
have
not
removed
nor
touched
her
what
happened
was
this
two
nights
ago
my
friend
seward
and
i
came
herewith
good
purpose
believe
me
i
opened
that
coffin
which
was
then
sealed
up
and
we
found
it
as
now
empty
we
then
waited
and
saw
something
white
come
through
the
trees
the
next
day
we
came
here
in
daytime
and
she
lay
there
did
she
not
friend
john
yes
that
night
we
were
just
in
time
one
more
so
small
child
was
missing
and
we
find
it
thank
god
unharmed
amongst
the
graves
yesterday
i
came
here
before
sundown
for
at
sundown
the
undead
can
move
i
waited
here
all
the
night
till
the
sun
rose
but
i
saw
nothing
it
was
most
probable
that
it
was
because
i
had
laid
over
the
clamps
of
those
doors
garlic
which
the
undead
cannot
bear
and
other
things
which
they
shun
last
night
there
was
no
exodus
so
tonight
before
the
sundown
i
took
away
my
garlic
and
other
things
and
so
it
is
we
find
this
coffin
empty
but
bear
with
me
so
far
there
is
much
that
is
strange
wait
you
with
me
outside
unseen
and
unheard
and
things
much
stranger
are
yet
to
be
sohere
he
shut
the
dark
slide
of
his
lanternnow
to
the
outside
he
opened
the
door
and
we
filed
out
he
coming
last
and
locking
the
door
behind
him
oh
but
it
seemed
fresh
and
pure
in
the
night
air
after
the
terror
of
that
vault
how
sweet
it
was
to
see
the
clouds
race
by
and
the
passing
gleams
of
the
moonlight
between
the
scudding
clouds
crossing
and
passinglike
the
gladness
and
sorrow
of
a
mans
life
how
sweet
it
was
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
that
had
no
taint
of
death
and
decay
how
humanising
to
see
the
red
lighting
of
the
sky
beyond
the
hill
and
to
hear
far
away
the
muffled
roar
that
marks
the
life
of
a
great
city
each
in
his
own
way
was
solemn
and
overcome
arthur
was
silent
and
was
i
could
see
striving
to
grasp
the
purpose
and
the
inner
meaning
of
the
mystery
i
was
myself
tolerably
patient
and
half
inclined
again
to
throw
aside
doubt
and
to
accept
van
helsings
conclusions
quincey
morris
was
phlegmatic
in
the
way
of
a
man
who
accepts
all
things
and
accepts
them
in
the
spirit
of
cool
bravery
with
hazard
of
all
he
has
to
stake
not
being
able
to
smoke
he
cut
himself
a
goodsized
plug
of
tobacco
and
began
to
chew
as
to
van
helsing
he
was
employed
in
a
definite
way
first
he
took
from
his
bag
a
mass
of
what
looked
like
thin
waferlike
biscuit
which
was
carefully
rolled
up
in
a
white
napkin
next
he
took
out
a
doublehandful
of
some
whitish
stuff
like
dough
or
putty
he
crumbled
the
wafer
up
fine
and
worked
it
into
the
mass
between
his
hands
this
he
then
took
and
rolling
it
into
thin
strips
began
to
lay
them
into
the
crevices
between
the
door
and
its
setting
in
the
tomb
i
was
somewhat
puzzled
at
this
and
being
close
asked
him
what
it
was
that
he
was
doing
arthur
and
quincey
drew
near
also
as
they
too
were
curious
he
answered
i
am
closing
the
tomb
so
that
the
undead
may
not
enter
and
is
that
stuff
you
have
put
there
going
to
do
it
asked
quincey
great
scott
is
this
a
game
it
is
what
is
that
which
you
are
using
this
time
the
question
was
by
arthur
van
helsing
reverently
lifted
his
hat
as
he
answered
the
host
i
brought
it
from
amsterdam
i
have
an
indulgence
it
was
an
answer
that
appalled
the
most
sceptical
of
us
and
we
felt
individually
that
in
the
presence
of
such
earnest
purpose
as
the
professors
a
purpose
which
could
thus
use
the
to
him
most
sacred
of
things
it
was
impossible
to
distrust
in
respectful
silence
we
took
the
places
assigned
to
us
close
round
the
tomb
but
hidden
from
the
sight
of
any
one
approaching
i
pitied
the
others
especially
arthur
i
had
myself
been
apprenticed
by
my
former
visits
to
this
watching
horror
and
yet
i
who
had
up
to
an
hour
ago
repudiated
the
proofs
felt
my
heart
sink
within
me
never
did
tombs
look
so
ghastly
white
never
did
cypress
or
yew
or
juniper
so
seem
the
embodiment
of
funereal
gloom
never
did
tree
or
grass
wave
or
rustle
so
ominously
never
did
bough
creak
so
mysteriously
and
never
did
the
faraway
howling
of
dogs
send
such
a
woeful
presage
through
the
night
there
was
a
long
spell
of
silence
a
big
aching
void
and
then
from
the
professor
a
keen
ssss
he
pointed
and
far
down
the
avenue
of
yews
we
saw
a
white
figure
advancea
dim
white
figure
which
held
something
dark
at
its
breast
the
figure
stopped
and
at
the
moment
a
ray
of
moonlight
fell
upon
the
masses
of
driving
clouds
and
showed
in
startling
prominence
a
darkhaired
woman
dressed
in
the
cerements
of
the
grave
we
could
not
see
the
face
for
it
was
bent
down
over
what
we
saw
to
be
a
fairhaired
child
there
was
a
pause
and
a
sharp
little
cry
such
as
a
child
gives
in
sleep
or
a
dog
as
it
lies
before
the
fire
and
dreams
we
were
starting
forward
but
the
professors
warning
hand
seen
by
us
as
he
stood
behind
a
yewtree
kept
us
back
and
then
as
we
looked
the
white
figure
moved
forwards
again
it
was
now
near
enough
for
us
to
see
clearly
and
the
moonlight
still
held
my
own
heart
grew
cold
as
ice
and
i
could
hear
the
gasp
of
arthur
as
we
recognised
the
features
of
lucy
westenra
lucy
westenra
but
yet
how
changed
the
sweetness
was
turned
to
adamantine
heartless
cruelty
and
the
purity
to
voluptuous
wantonness
van
helsing
stepped
out
and
obedient
to
his
gesture
we
all
advanced
too
the
four
of
us
ranged
in
a
line
before
the
door
of
the
tomb
van
helsing
raised
his
lantern
and
drew
the
slide
by
the
concentrated
light
that
fell
on
lucys
face
we
could
see
that
the
lips
were
crimson
with
fresh
blood
and
that
the
stream
had
trickled
over
her
chin
and
stained
the
purity
of
her
lawn
deathrobe
we
shuddered
with
horror
i
could
see
by
the
tremulous
light
that
even
van
helsings
iron
nerve
had
failed
arthur
was
next
to
me
and
if
i
had
not
seized
his
arm
and
held
him
up
he
would
have
fallen
when
lucyi
call
the
thing
that
was
before
us
lucy
because
it
bore
her
shapesaw
us
she
drew
back
with
an
angry
snarl
such
as
a
cat
gives
when
taken
unawares
then
her
eyes
ranged
over
us
lucys
eyes
in
form
and
colour
but
lucys
eyes
unclean
and
full
of
hellfire
instead
of
the
pure
gentle
orbs
we
knew
at
that
moment
the
remnant
of
my
love
passed
into
hate
and
loathing
had
she
then
to
be
killed
i
could
have
done
it
with
savage
delight
as
she
looked
her
eyes
blazed
with
unholy
light
and
the
face
became
wreathed
with
a
voluptuous
smile
oh
god
how
it
made
me
shudder
to
see
it
with
a
careless
motion
she
flung
to
the
ground
callous
as
a
devil
the
child
that
up
to
now
she
had
clutched
strenuously
to
her
breast
growling
over
it
as
a
dog
growls
over
a
bone
the
child
gave
a
sharp
cry
and
lay
there
moaning
there
was
a
coldbloodedness
in
the
act
which
wrung
a
groan
from
arthur
when
she
advanced
to
him
with
outstretched
arms
and
a
wanton
smile
he
fell
back
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
she
still
advanced
however
and
with
a
languorous
voluptuous
grace
said
come
to
me
arthur
leave
these
others
and
come
to
me
my
arms
are
hungry
for
you
come
and
we
can
rest
together
come
my
husband
come
there
was
something
diabolically
sweet
in
her
tonessomething
of
the
tingling
of
glass
when
struckwhich
rang
through
the
brains
even
of
us
who
heard
the
words
addressed
to
another
as
for
arthur
he
seemed
under
a
spell
moving
his
hands
from
his
face
he
opened
wide
his
arms
she
was
leaping
for
them
when
van
helsing
sprang
forward
and
held
between
them
his
little
golden
crucifix
she
recoiled
from
it
and
with
a
suddenly
distorted
face
full
of
rage
dashed
past
him
as
if
to
enter
the
tomb
when
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
door
however
she
stopped
as
if
arrested
by
some
irresistible
force
then
she
turned
and
her
face
was
shown
in
the
clear
burst
of
moonlight
and
by
the
lamp
which
had
now
no
quiver
from
van
helsings
iron
nerves
never
did
i
see
such
baffled
malice
on
a
face
and
never
i
trust
shall
such
ever
be
seen
again
by
mortal
eyes
the
beautiful
colour
became
livid
the
eyes
seemed
to
throw
out
sparks
of
hellfire
the
brows
were
wrinkled
as
though
the
folds
of
the
flesh
were
the
coils
of
medusas
snakes
and
the
lovely
bloodstained
mouth
grew
to
an
open
square
as
in
the
passion
masks
of
the
greeks
and
japanese
if
ever
a
face
meant
deathif
looks
could
killwe
saw
it
at
that
moment
and
so
for
full
half
a
minute
which
seemed
an
eternity
she
remained
between
the
lifted
crucifix
and
the
sacred
closing
of
her
means
of
entry
van
helsing
broke
the
silence
by
asking
arthur
answer
me
oh
my
friend
am
i
to
proceed
in
my
work
arthur
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
as
he
answered
do
as
you
will
friend
do
as
you
will
there
can
be
no
horror
like
this
ever
any
more
and
he
groaned
in
spirit
quincey
and
i
simultaneously
moved
towards
him
and
took
his
arms
we
could
hear
the
click
of
the
closing
lantern
as
van
helsing
held
it
down
coming
close
to
the
tomb
he
began
to
remove
from
the
chinks
some
of
the
sacred
emblem
which
he
had
placed
there
we
all
looked
on
in
horrified
amazement
as
we
saw
when
he
stood
back
the
woman
with
a
corporeal
body
as
real
at
that
moment
as
our
own
pass
in
through
the
interstice
where
scarce
a
knifeblade
could
have
gone
we
all
felt
a
glad
sense
of
relief
when
we
saw
the
professor
calmly
restoring
the
strings
of
putty
to
the
edges
of
the
door
when
this
was
done
he
lifted
the
child
and
said
come
now
my
friends
we
can
do
no
more
till
tomorrow
there
is
a
funeral
at
noon
so
here
we
shall
all
come
before
long
after
that
the
friends
of
the
dead
will
all
be
gone
by
two
and
when
the
sexton
lock
the
gate
we
shall
remain
then
there
is
more
to
do
but
not
like
this
of
tonight
as
for
this
little
one
he
is
not
much
harm
and
by
tomorrow
night
he
shall
be
well
we
shall
leave
him
where
the
police
will
find
him
as
on
the
other
night
and
then
to
home
coming
close
to
arthur
he
said
my
friend
arthur
you
have
had
a
sore
trial
but
after
when
you
look
back
you
will
see
how
it
was
necessary
you
are
now
in
the
bitter
waters
my
child
by
this
time
tomorrow
you
will
please
god
have
passed
them
and
have
drunk
of
the
sweet
waters
so
do
not
mourn
overmuch
till
then
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
arthur
and
quincey
came
home
with
me
and
we
tried
to
cheer
each
other
on
the
way
we
had
left
the
child
in
safety
and
were
tired
so
we
all
slept
with
more
or
less
reality
of
sleep





29
september
nighta
little
before
twelve
oclock
we
threearthur
quincey
morris
and
myselfcalled
for
the
professor
it
was
odd
to
notice
that
by
common
consent
we
had
all
put
on
black
clothes
of
course
arthur
wore
black
for
he
was
in
deep
mourning
but
the
rest
of
us
wore
it
by
instinct
we
got
to
the
churchyard
by
halfpast
one
and
strolled
about
keeping
out
of
official
observation
so
that
when
the
gravediggers
had
completed
their
task
and
the
sexton
under
the
belief
that
every
one
had
gone
had
locked
the
gate
we
had
the
place
all
to
ourselves
van
helsing
instead
of
his
little
black
bag
had
with
him
a
long
leather
one
something
like
a
cricketing
bag
it
was
manifestly
of
fair
weight
when
we
were
alone
and
had
heard
the
last
of
the
footsteps
die
out
up
the
road
we
silently
and
as
if
by
ordered
intention
followed
the
professor
to
the
tomb
he
unlocked
the
door
and
we
entered
closing
it
behind
us
then
he
took
from
his
bag
the
lantern
which
he
lit
and
also
two
wax
candles
which
when
lighted
he
stuck
by
melting
their
own
ends
on
other
coffins
so
that
they
might
give
light
sufficient
to
work
by
when
he
again
lifted
the
lid
off
lucys
coffin
we
all
lookedarthur
trembling
like
an
aspenand
saw
that
the
body
lay
there
in
all
its
deathbeauty
but
there
was
no
love
in
my
own
heart
nothing
but
loathing
for
the
foul
thing
which
had
taken
lucys
shape
without
her
soul
i
could
see
even
arthurs
face
grow
hard
as
he
looked
presently
he
said
to
van
helsing
is
this
really
lucys
body
or
only
a
demon
in
her
shape
it
is
her
body
and
yet
not
it
but
wait
a
while
and
you
all
see
her
as
she
was
and
is
she
seemed
like
a
nightmare
of
lucy
as
she
lay
there
the
pointed
teeth
the
bloodstained
voluptuous
mouthwhich
it
made
one
shudder
to
seethe
whole
carnal
and
unspiritual
appearance
seeming
like
a
devilish
mockery
of
lucys
sweet
purity
van
helsing
with
his
usual
methodicalness
began
taking
the
various
contents
from
his
bag
and
placing
them
ready
for
use
first
he
took
out
a
soldering
iron
and
some
plumbing
solder
and
then
a
small
oillamp
which
gave
out
when
lit
in
a
corner
of
the
tomb
gas
which
burned
at
fierce
heat
with
a
blue
flame
then
his
operating
knives
which
he
placed
to
hand
and
last
a
round
wooden
stake
some
two
and
a
half
or
three
inches
thick
and
about
three
feet
long
one
end
of
it
was
hardened
by
charring
in
the
fire
and
was
sharpened
to
a
fine
point
with
this
stake
came
a
heavy
hammer
such
as
in
households
is
used
in
the
coalcellar
for
breaking
the
lumps
to
me
a
doctors
preparations
for
work
of
any
kind
are
stimulating
and
bracing
but
the
effect
of
these
things
on
both
arthur
and
quincey
was
to
cause
them
a
sort
of
consternation
they
both
however
kept
their
courage
and
remained
silent
and
quiet
when
all
was
ready
van
helsing
said
before
we
do
anything
let
me
tell
you
this
it
is
out
of
the
lore
and
experience
of
the
ancients
and
of
all
those
who
have
studied
the
powers
of
the
undead
when
they
become
such
there
comes
with
the
change
the
curse
of
immortality
they
cannot
die
but
must
go
on
age
after
age
adding
new
victims
and
multiplying
the
evils
of
the
world
for
all
that
die
from
the
preying
of
the
undead
becomes
themselves
undead
and
prey
on
their
kind
and
so
the
circle
goes
on
ever
widening
like
as
the
ripples
from
a
stone
thrown
in
the
water
friend
arthur
if
you
had
met
that
kiss
which
you
know
of
before
poor
lucy
die
or
again
last
night
when
you
open
your
arms
to
her
you
would
in
time
when
you
had
died
have
become
nosferatu
as
they
call
it
in
eastern
europe
and
would
all
time
make
more
of
those
undeads
that
so
have
fill
us
with
horror
the
career
of
this
so
unhappy
dear
lady
is
but
just
begun
those
children
whose
blood
she
suck
are
not
as
yet
so
much
the
worse
but
if
she
live
on
undead
more
and
more
they
lose
their
blood
and
by
her
power
over
them
they
come
to
her
and
so
she
draw
their
blood
with
that
so
wicked
mouth
but
if
she
die
in
truth
then
all
cease
the
tiny
wounds
of
the
throats
disappear
and
they
go
back
to
their
plays
unknowing
ever
of
what
has
been
but
of
the
most
blessed
of
all
when
this
now
undead
be
made
to
rest
as
true
dead
then
the
soul
of
the
poor
lady
whom
we
love
shall
again
be
free
instead
of
working
wickedness
by
night
and
growing
more
debased
in
the
assimilating
of
it
by
day
she
shall
take
her
place
with
the
other
angels
so
that
my
friend
it
will
be
a
blessed
hand
for
her
that
shall
strike
the
blow
that
sets
her
free
to
this
i
am
willing
but
is
there
none
amongst
us
who
has
a
better
right
will
it
be
no
joy
to
think
of
hereafter
in
the
silence
of
the
night
when
sleep
is
not
it
was
my
hand
that
sent
her
to
the
stars
it
was
the
hand
of
him
that
loved
her
best
the
hand
that
of
all
she
would
herself
have
chosen
had
it
been
to
her
to
choose
tell
me
if
there
be
such
a
one
amongst
us
we
all
looked
at
arthur
he
saw
too
what
we
all
did
the
infinite
kindness
which
suggested
that
his
should
be
the
hand
which
would
restore
lucy
to
us
as
a
holy
and
not
an
unholy
memory
he
stepped
forward
and
said
bravely
though
his
hand
trembled
and
his
face
was
as
pale
as
snow
my
true
friend
from
the
bottom
of
my
broken
heart
i
thank
you
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
and
i
shall
not
falter
van
helsing
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
brave
lad
a
moments
courage
and
it
is
done
this
stake
must
be
driven
through
her
it
will
be
a
fearful
ordealbe
not
deceived
in
thatbut
it
will
be
only
a
short
time
and
you
will
then
rejoice
more
than
your
pain
was
great
from
this
grim
tomb
you
will
emerge
as
though
you
tread
on
air
but
you
must
not
falter
when
once
you
have
begun
only
think
that
we
your
true
friends
are
round
you
and
that
we
pray
for
you
all
the
time
go
on
said
arthur
hoarsely
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
take
this
stake
in
your
left
hand
ready
to
place
the
point
over
the
heart
and
the
hammer
in
your
right
then
when
we
begin
our
prayer
for
the
deadi
shall
read
him
i
have
here
the
book
and
the
others
shall
followstrike
in
gods
name
that
so
all
may
be
well
with
the
dead
that
we
love
and
that
the
undead
pass
away
arthur
took
the
stake
and
the
hammer
and
when
once
his
mind
was
set
on
action
his
hands
never
trembled
nor
even
quivered
van
helsing
opened
his
missal
and
began
to
read
and
quincey
and
i
followed
as
well
as
we
could
arthur
placed
the
point
over
the
heart
and
as
i
looked
i
could
see
its
dint
in
the
white
flesh
then
he
struck
with
all
his
might
the
thing
in
the
coffin
writhed
and
a
hideous
bloodcurdling
screech
came
from
the
opened
red
lips
the
body
shook
and
quivered
and
twisted
in
wild
contortions
the
sharp
white
teeth
champed
together
till
the
lips
were
cut
and
the
mouth
was
smeared
with
a
crimson
foam
but
arthur
never
faltered
he
looked
like
a
figure
of
thor
as
his
untrembling
arm
rose
and
fell
driving
deeper
and
deeper
the
mercybearing
stake
whilst
the
blood
from
the
pierced
heart
welled
and
spurted
up
around
it
his
face
was
set
and
high
duty
seemed
to
shine
through
it
the
sight
of
it
gave
us
courage
so
that
our
voices
seemed
to
ring
through
the
little
vault
and
then
the
writhing
and
quivering
of
the
body
became
less
and
the
teeth
seemed
to
champ
and
the
face
to
quiver
finally
it
lay
still
the
terrible
task
was
over
the
hammer
fell
from
arthurs
hand
he
reeled
and
would
have
fallen
had
we
not
caught
him
the
great
drops
of
sweat
sprang
from
his
forehead
and
his
breath
came
in
broken
gasps
it
had
indeed
been
an
awful
strain
on
him
and
had
he
not
been
forced
to
his
task
by
more
than
human
considerations
he
could
never
have
gone
through
with
it
for
a
few
minutes
we
were
so
taken
up
with
him
that
we
did
not
look
towards
the
coffin
when
we
did
however
a
murmur
of
startled
surprise
ran
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
we
gazed
so
eagerly
that
arthur
rose
for
he
had
been
seated
on
the
ground
and
came
and
looked
too
and
then
a
glad
strange
light
broke
over
his
face
and
dispelled
altogether
the
gloom
of
horror
that
lay
upon
it
there
in
the
coffin
lay
no
longer
the
foul
thing
that
we
had
so
dreaded
and
grown
to
hate
that
the
work
of
her
destruction
was
yielded
as
a
privilege
to
the
one
best
entitled
to
it
but
lucy
as
we
had
seen
her
in
her
life
with
her
face
of
unequalled
sweetness
and
purity
true
that
there
were
there
as
we
had
seen
them
in
life
the
traces
of
care
and
pain
and
waste
but
these
were
all
dear
to
us
for
they
marked
her
truth
to
what
we
knew
one
and
all
we
felt
that
the
holy
calm
that
lay
like
sunshine
over
the
wasted
face
and
form
was
only
an
earthly
token
and
symbol
of
the
calm
that
was
to
reign
for
ever
van
helsing
came
and
laid
his
hand
on
arthurs
shoulder
and
said
to
him
and
now
arthur
my
friend
dear
lad
am
i
not
forgiven
the
reaction
of
the
terrible
strain
came
as
he
took
the
old
mans
hand
in
his
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
pressed
it
and
said
forgiven
god
bless
you
that
you
have
given
my
dear
one
her
soul
again
and
me
peace
he
put
his
hands
on
the
professors
shoulder
and
laying
his
head
on
his
breast
cried
for
a
while
silently
whilst
we
stood
unmoving
when
he
raised
his
head
van
helsing
said
to
him
and
now
my
child
you
may
kiss
her
kiss
her
dead
lips
if
you
will
as
she
would
have
you
to
if
for
her
to
choose
for
she
is
not
a
grinning
devil
nownot
any
more
a
foul
thing
for
all
eternity
no
longer
she
is
the
devils
undead
she
is
gods
true
dead
whose
soul
is
with
him
arthur
bent
and
kissed
her
and
then
we
sent
him
and
quincey
out
of
the
tomb
the
professor
and
i
sawed
the
top
off
the
stake
leaving
the
point
of
it
in
the
body
then
we
cut
off
the
head
and
filled
the
mouth
with
garlic
we
soldered
up
the
leaden
coffin
screwed
on
the
coffinlid
and
gathering
up
our
belongings
came
away
when
the
professor
locked
the
door
he
gave
the
key
to
arthur
outside
the
air
was
sweet
the
sun
shone
and
the
birds
sang
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
nature
were
tuned
to
a
different
pitch
there
was
gladness
and
mirth
and
peace
everywhere
for
we
were
at
rest
ourselves
on
one
account
and
we
were
glad
though
it
was
with
a
tempered
joy
before
we
moved
away
van
helsing
said
now
my
friends
one
step
of
our
work
is
done
one
the
most
harrowing
to
ourselves
but
there
remains
a
greater
task
to
find
out
the
author
of
all
this
our
sorrow
and
to
stamp
him
out
i
have
clues
which
we
can
follow
but
it
is
a
long
task
and
a
difficult
and
there
is
danger
in
it
and
pain
shall
you
not
all
help
me
we
have
learned
to
believe
all
of
usis
it
not
so
and
since
so
do
we
not
see
our
duty
yes
and
do
we
not
promise
to
go
on
to
the
bitter
end
each
in
turn
we
took
his
hand
and
the
promise
was
made
then
said
the
professor
as
we
moved
off
two
nights
hence
you
shall
meet
with
me
and
dine
together
at
seven
of
the
clock
with
friend
john
i
shall
entreat
two
others
two
that
you
know
not
as
yet
and
i
shall
be
ready
to
all
our
work
show
and
our
plans
unfold
friend
john
you
come
with
me
home
for
i
have
much
to
consult
about
and
you
can
help
me
tonight
i
leave
for
amsterdam
but
shall
return
tomorrow
night
and
then
begins
our
great
quest
but
first
i
shall
have
much
to
say
so
that
you
may
know
what
is
to
do
and
to
dread
then
our
promise
shall
be
made
to
each
other
anew
for
there
is
a
terrible
task
before
us
and
once
our
feet
are
on
the
ploughshare
we
must
not

when
the
wire
was
despatched
he
had
a
cup
of
tea
over
it
he
told
me
of
a
diary
kept
by
jonathan
harker
when
abroad
and
gave
me
a
typewritten
copy
of
it
as
also
of
mrs

whitby

and
study
them
well
when
i
have
returned
you
will
be
master
of
all
the
facts
and
we
can
then
better
enter
on
our
inquisition
keep
them
safe
for
there
is
in
them
much
of
treasure
you
will
need
all
your
faith
even
you
who
have
had
such
an
experience
as
that
of
today
what

here
told
he
laid
his
hand
heavily
and
gravely
on
the
packet
of
papers
as
he
spoke
may
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
to
you
and
me
and
many
another
or
it
may
sound
the
knell
of
the
undead
who
walk
the
earth
read
all
i
pray
you
with
the
open
mind
and
if
you
can
add
in
any
way
to
the
story
here
told
do
so
for
it
is
allimportant
you
have
kept
diary
of
all
these
so
strange
things
is
it
not
so
yes
then
we
shall
go
through
all
these
together
when
we
meet
he
then
made
ready
for
his
departure
and
shortly
after
drove
off
to
liverpool
street
i
took
my
way
to
paddington
where
i
arrived
about
fifteen
minutes
before
the
train
came
in
the
crowd
melted
away
after
the
bustling
fashion
common
to
arrival
platforms
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
lest
i
might
miss
my
guest
when
a
sweetfaced
daintylooking
girl
stepped
up
to
me
and
after
a
quick
glance
said
dr
seward
is
it
not
and
you
are
mrs
harker
i
answered
at
once
whereupon
she
held
out
her
hand
i
knew
you
from
the
description
of
poor
dear
lucy
but
she
stopped
suddenly
and
a
quick
blush
overspread
her
face
the
blush
that
rose
to
my
own
cheeks
somehow
set
us
both
at
ease
for
it
was
a
tacit
answer
to
her
own
i
got
her
luggage
which
included
a
typewriter
and
we
took
the
underground
to
fenchurch
street
after
i
had
sent
a
wire
to
my
housekeeper
to
have
a
sittingroom
and
bedroom
prepared
at
once
for
mrs
harker
in
due
time
we
arrived
she
knew
of
course
that
the
place
was
a
lunatic
asylum
but
i
could
see
that
she
was
unable
to
repress
a
shudder
when
we
entered
she
told
me
that
if
she
might
she
would
come
presently
to
my
study
as
she
had
much
to
say
so
here
i
am
finishing
my
entry
in
my
phonograph
diary
whilst
i
await
her
as
yet
i
have
not
had
the
chance
of
looking
at
the
papers
which
van
helsing
left
with
me
though
they
lie
open
before
me
i
must
get
her
interested
in
something
so
that
i
may
have
an
opportunity
of
reading
them
she
does
not
know
how
precious
time
is
or
what
a
task
we
have
in
hand
i
must
be
careful
not
to
frighten
her
here
she
is

29
septemberafter
i
had
tidied
myself
i
went
down
to
dr
sewards
study
at
the
door
i
paused
a
moment
for
i
thought
i
heard
him
talking
with
some
one
as
however
he
had
pressed
me
to
be
quick
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
on
his
calling
out
come
in
i
entered
to
my
intense
surprise
there
was
no
one
with
him
he
was
quite
alone
and
on
the
table
opposite
him
was
what
i
knew
at
once
from
the
description
to
be
a
phonograph
i
had
never
seen
one
and
was
much
interested
i
hope
i
did
not
keep
you
waiting
i
said
but
i
stayed
at
the
door
as
i
heard
you
talking
and
thought
there
was
some
one
with
you
oh
he
replied
with
a
smile
i
was
only
entering
my
diary
your
diary
i
asked
him
in
surprise
yes
he
answered
i
keep
it
in
this
as
he
spoke
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
phonograph
i
felt
quite
excited
over
it
and
blurted
out
why
this
beats
even
shorthand
may
i
hear
it
say
something
certainly
he
replied
with
alacrity
and
stood
up
to
put
it
in
train
for
speaking
then
he
paused
and
a
troubled
look
overspread
his
face
the
fact
is
he
began
awkwardly
i
only
keep
my
diary
in
it
and
as
it
is
entirelyalmost
entirelyabout
my
cases
it
may
be
awkwardthat
is
i
mean
he
stopped
and
i
tried
to
help
him
out
of
his
embarrassment
you
helped
to
attend
dear
lucy
at
the
end
let
me
hear
how
she
died
for
all
that
i
know
of
her
i
shall
be
very
grateful
she
was
very
very
dear
to
me
to
my
surprise
he
answered
with
a
horrorstruck
look
in
his
face
tell
you
of
her
death
not
for
the
wide
world
why
not
i
asked
for
some
grave
terrible
feeling
was
coming
over
me
again
he
paused
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
trying
to
invent
an
excuse
at
length
he
stammered
out
you
see
i
do
not
know
how
to
pick
out
any
particular
part
of
the
diary
even
while
he
was
speaking
an
idea
dawned
upon
him
and
he
said
with
unconscious
simplicity
in
a
different
voice
and
with
the
navet
of
a
child
thats
quite
true
upon
my
honour
honest
indian
i
could
not
but
smile
at
which
he
grimaced
i
gave
myself
away
that
time
he
said
but
do
you
know
that
although
i
have
kept
the
diary
for
months
past
it
never
once
struck
me
how
i
was
going
to
find
any
particular
part
of
it
in
case
i
wanted
to
look
it
up
by
this
time
my
mind
was
made
up
that
the
diary
of
a
doctor
who
attended
lucy
might
have
something
to
add
to
the
sum
of
our
knowledge
of
that
terrible
being
and
i
said
boldly
then
dr
seward
you
had
better
let
me
copy
it
out
for
you
on
my
typewriter
he
grew
to
a
positively
deathly
pallor
as
he
said
no
no
no
for
all
the
world
i
wouldnt
let
you
know
that
terrible
story
then
it
was
terrible
my
intuition
was
right
for
a
moment
i
thought
and
as
my
eyes
ranged
the
room
unconsciously
looking
for
something
or
some
opportunity
to
aid
me
they
lit
on
a
great
batch
of
typewriting
on
the
table
his
eyes
caught
the
look
in
mine
and
without
his
thinking
followed
their
direction
as
they
saw
the
parcel
he
realised
my
meaning
you
do
not
know
me
i
said
when
you
have
read
those
papersmy
own
diary
and
my
husbands
also
which
i
have
typedyou
will
know
me
better
i
have
not
faltered
in
giving
every
thought
of
my
own
heart
in
this
cause
but
of
course
you
do
not
know
meyet
and
i
must
not
expect
you
to
trust
me
so
far
he
is
certainly
a
man
of
noble
nature
poor
dear
lucy
was
right
about
him
he
stood
up
and
opened
a
large
drawer
in
which
were
arranged
in
order
a
number
of
hollow
cylinders
of
metal
covered
with
dark
wax
and
said
you
are
quite
right
i
did
not
trust
you
because
i
did
not
know
you
but
i
know
you
now
and
let
me
say
that
i
should
have
known
you
long
ago
i
know
that
lucy
told
you
of
me
she
told
me
of
you
too
may
i
make
the
only
atonement
in
my
power
take
the
cylinders
and
hear
themthe
first
halfdozen
of
them
are
personal
to
me
and
they
will
not
horrify
you
then
you
will
know
me
better
dinner
will
by
then
be
ready
in
the
meantime
i
shall
read
over
some
of
these
documents
and
shall
be
better
able
to
understand
certain
things
he
carried
the
phonograph
himself
up
to
my
sittingroom
and
adjusted
it
for
me
now
i
shall
learn
something
pleasant
i
am
sure
for
it
will
tell
me
the
other
side
of
a
true
love

of
which
i
know
one
side
already
dr
sewards
diary
29
septemberi
was
so
absorbed
in
that
wonderful
diary
of
jonathan
harker
and
that
other
of
his
wife
that
i
let
the
time
run
on
without
thinking
mrs
harker
was
not
down
when
the
maid
came
to
announce
dinner
so
i
said
she
is
possibly
tired
let
dinner
wait
an
hour
and
i
went
on
with
my
work
i
had
just
finished
mrs
harkers
diary
when
she
came
in
she
looked
sweetly
pretty
but
very
sad
and
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying
this
somehow
moved
me
much
of
late
i
have
had
cause
for
tears
god
knows
but
the
relief
of
them
was
denied
me
and
now
the
sight
of
those
sweet
eyes
brightened
with
recent
tears
went
straight
to
my
heart
so
i
said
as
gently
as
i
could
i
greatly
fear
i
have
distressed
you
oh
no
not
distressed
me
she
replied
but
i
have
been
more
touched
than
i
can
say
by
your
grief
that
is
a
wonderful
machine
but
it
is
cruelly
true
it
told
me
in
its
very
tones
the
anguish
of
your
heart
it
was
like
a
soul
crying
out
to
almighty
god
no
one
must
hear
them
spoken
ever
again
see
i
have
tried
to
be
useful
i
have
copied
out
the
words
on
my
typewriter
and
none
other
need
now
hear
your
heart
beat
as
i
did
no
one
need
ever
know
shall
ever
know
i
said
in
a
low
voice
she
laid
her
hand
on
mine
and
said
very
gravely
ah
but
they
must
must
but
why
i
asked
because
it
is
a
part
of
the
terrible
story
a
part
of
poor
dear
lucys
death
and
all
that
led
to
it
because
in
the
struggle
which
we
have
before
us
to
rid
the
earth
of
this
terrible
monster
we
must
have
all
the
knowledge
and
all
the
help
which
we
can
get
i
think
that
the
cylinders
which
you
gave
me
contained
more
than
you
intended
me
to
know
but
i
can
see
that
there
are
in
your
record
many
lights
to
this
dark
mystery
you
will
let
me
help
will
you
not
i
know
all
up
to
a
certain
point
and
i
see
already
though
your
diary
only
took
me
to
7
september
how
poor
lucy
was
beset
and
how
her
terrible
doom
was
being
wrought
out
jonathan
and
i
have
been
working
day
and
night
since
professor
van
helsing
saw
us
he
is
gone
to
whitby
to
get
more
information
and
he
will
be
here
tomorrow
to
help
us
we
need
have
no
secrets
amongst
us
working
together
and
with
absolute
trust
we
can
surely
be
stronger
than
if
some
of
us
were
in
the
dark
she
looked
at
me
so
appealingly
and
at
the
same
time
manifested
such
courage
and
resolution
in
her
bearing
that
i
gave
in
at
once
to
her
wishes
you
shall
i
said
do
as
you
like
in
the
matter
god
forgive
me
if
i
do
wrong
there
are
terrible
things
yet
to
learn
of
but
if
you
have
so
far
travelled
on
the
road
to
poor
lucys
death
you
will
not
be
content
i
know
to
remain
in
the
dark
nay
the
endthe
very
endmay
give
you
a
gleam
of
peace
come
there
is
dinner
we
must
keep
one
another
strong
for
what
is
before
us
we
have
a
cruel
and
dreadful
task
when
you
have
eaten
you
shall
learn
the
rest
and
i
shall
answer
any
questions
you
askif
there
be
anything
which
you
do
not

journal
29
septemberafter
dinner
i
came
with
dr
seward
to
his
study
he
brought
back
the
phonograph
from
my
room
and
i
took
my
typewriter
he
placed
me
in
a
comfortable
chair
and
arranged
the
phonograph
so
that
i
could
touch
it
without
getting
up
and
showed
me
how
to
stop
it
in
case
i
should
want
to
pause
then
he
very
thoughtfully
took
a
chair
with
his
back
to
me
so
that
i
might
be
as
free
as
possible
and
began
to
read
i
put
the
forked
metal
to
my
ears
and
listened
when
the
terrible
story
of
lucys
death
andand
all
that
followed
was
done
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
powerless
fortunately
i
am
not
of
a
fainting
disposition
when
dr
seward
saw
me
he
jumped
up
with
a
horrified
exclamation
and
hurriedly
taking
a
casebottle
from
a
cupboard
gave
me
some
brandy
which
in
a
few
minutes
somewhat
restored
me
my
brain
was
all
in
a
whirl
and
only
that
there
came
through
all
the
multitude
of
horrors
the
holy
ray
of
light
that
my
dear
dear
lucy
was
at
last
at
peace
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
borne
it
without
making
a
scene
it
is
all
so
wild
and
mysterious
and
strange
that
if
i
had
not
known
jonathans
experience
in
transylvania
i
could
not
have
believed
as
it
was
i
didnt
know
what
to
believe
and
so
got
out
of
my
difficulty
by
attending
to
something
else
i
took
the
cover
off
my
typewriter
and
said
to
dr
seward
let
me
write
this
all
out
now
we
must
be
ready
for
dr
van
helsing
when
he
comes
i
have
sent
a
telegram
to
jonathan
to
come
on
here
when
he
arrives
in
london
from
whitby
in
this
matter
dates
are
everything
and
i
think
that
if
we
get
all
our
material
ready
and
have
every
item
put
in
chronological
order
we
shall
have
done
much
you
tell
me
that
lord
godalming
and
mr
morris
are
coming
too
let
us
be
able
to
tell
him
when
they
come
he
accordingly
set
the
phonograph
at
a
slow
pace
and
i
began
to
typewrite
from
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
cylinder
i
used
manifold
and
so
took
three
copies
of
the
diary
just
as
i
had
done
with
all
the
rest
it
was
late
when
i
got
through
but
dr
seward
went
about
his
work
of
going
his
round
of
the
patients
when
he
had
finished
he
came
back
and
sat
near
me
reading
so
that
i
did
not
feel
too
lonely
whilst
i
worked
how
good
and
thoughtful
he
is
the
world
seems
full
of
good
meneven
if
there
are
monsters
in
it
before
i
left
him
i
remembered
what
jonathan
put
in
his
diary
of
the
professors
perturbation
at
reading
something
in
an
evening
paper
at
the
station
at
exeter
so
seeing
that
dr
seward
keeps
his
newspapers
i
borrowed
the
files
of
the
westminster
gazette
and
the
pall
mall
gazette
and
took
them
to
my
room
i
remember
how
much
the
dailygraph
and
the
whitby
gazette
of
which
i
had
made
cuttings
helped
us
to
understand
the
terrible
events
at
whitby
when
count
dracula
landed
so
i
shall
look
through
the
evening
papers
since
then
and
perhaps
i
shall
get
some
new
light
i
am
not
sleepy
and
the
work
will
help
to
keep
me
quiet

septembermr
harker
arrived
at
nine
oclock
he
had
got
his
wifes
wire
just
before
starting
he
is
uncommonly
clever
if
one
can
judge
from
his
face
and
full
of
energy
if
this
journal
be
trueand
judging
by
ones
own
wonderful
experiences
it
must
behe
is
also
a
man
of
great
nerve
that
going
down
to
the
vault
a
second
time
was
a
remarkable
piece
of
daring
after
reading
his
account
of
it
i
was
prepared
to
meet
a
good
specimen
of
manhood
but
hardly
the
quiet
businesslike
gentleman
who
came
here
today





laterafter
lunch
harker
and
his
wife
went
back
to
their
own
room
and
as
i
passed
a
while
ago
i
heard
the
click
of
the
typewriter
they
are
hard
at
it
mrs
harker
says
that
they
are
knitting
together
in
chronological
order
every
scrap
of
evidence
they
have
harker
has
got
the
letters
between
the
consignee
of
the
boxes
at
whitby
and
the
carriers
in
london
who
took
charge
of
them
he
is
now
reading
his
wifes
typescript
of
my
diary
i
wonder
what
they
make
out
of
it
here
it
is
strange
that
it
never
struck
me
that
the
very
next
house
might
be
the
counts
hidingplace
goodness
knows
that
we
had
enough
clues
from
the
conduct
of
the
patient
renfield
the
bundle
of
letters
relating
to
the
purchase
of
the
house
were
with
the
typescript
oh
if
we
had
only
had
them
earlier
we
might
have
saved
poor
lucy
stop
that
way
madness
lies
harker
has
gone
back
and
is
again
collating
his
material
he
says
that
by
dinnertime
they
will
be
able
to
show
a
whole
connected
narrative
he
thinks
that
in
the
meantime
i
should
see
renfield
as
hitherto
he
has
been
a
sort
of
index
to
the
coming
and
going
of
the
count
i
hardly
see
this
yet
but
when
i
get
at
the
dates
i
suppose
i
shall
what
a
good
thing
that
mrs
harker
put
my
cylinders
into
type
we
never
could
have
found
the
dates
otherwise
i
found
renfield
sitting
placidly
in
his
room
with
his
hands
folded
smiling
benignly
at
the
moment
he
seemed
as
sane
as
any
one
i
ever
saw
i
sat
down
and
talked
with
him
on
a
lot
of
subjects
all
of
which
he
treated
naturally
he
then
of
his
own
accord
spoke
of
going
home
a
subject
he
has
never
mentioned
to
my
knowledge
during
his
sojourn
here
in
fact
he
spoke
quite
confidently
of
getting
his
discharge
at
once
i
believe
that
had
i
not
had
the
chat
with
harker
and
read
the
letters
and
the
dates
of
his
outbursts
i
should
have
been
prepared
to
sign
for
him
after
a
brief
time
of
observation
as
it
is
i
am
darkly
suspicious
all
those
outbreaks
were
in
some
way
linked
with
the
proximity
of
the
count
what
then
does
this
absolute
content
mean
can
it
be
that
his
instinct
is
satisfied
as
to
the
vampires
ultimate
triumph
stay
he
is
himself
zophagous
and
in
his
wild
ravings
outside
the
chapel
door
of
the
deserted
house
he
always
spoke
of
master
this
all
seems
confirmation
of
our
idea
however
after
a
while
i
came
away
my
friend
is
just
a
little
too
sane
at
present
to
make
it
safe
to
probe
him
too
deep
with
questions
he
might
begin
to
think
and
then
so
i
came
away
i
mistrust
these
quiet
moods
of
his
so
i
have
given
the
attendant
a
hint
to
look
closely
after
him
and
to
have
a
straitwaistcoat
ready
in
case
of
need

in
train
to
londonwhen
i
received
mr
billingtons
courteous
message
that
he
would
give
me
any
information
in
his
power
i
thought
it
best
to
go
down
to
whitby
and
make
on
the
spot
such
inquiries
as
i
wanted
it
was
now
my
object
to
trace
that
horrid
cargo
of
the
counts
to
its
place
in
london
later
we
may
be
able

junior
a
nice
lad
met
me
at
the
station
and
brought
me
to
his
fathers
house
where
they
had
decided
that
i
must
stay
the
night
they
are
hospitable
with
true
yorkshire
hospitality
give
a

everything
and
leave
him
free
to
do
as
he
likes
they
all
knew
that
i
was
busy
and
that
my
stay
was
short
and
mr
billington
had
ready
in
his
office
all
the
papers
concerning
the
consignment
of
boxes
it
gave
me
almost
a
turn
to
see
again
one
of
the
letters
which
i
had
seen
on
the
counts
table
before
i
knew
of
his
diabolical
plans
everything
had
been
carefully
thought
out
and
done
systematically
and
with
precision
he
seemed
to
have
been
prepared
for
every
obstacle
which
might
be
placed
by
accident
in
the
way
of
his
intentions
being
carried
out
to
use
an
americanism
he
had
taken
no
chances
and
the
absolute
accuracy
with
which
his
instructions
were
fulfilled
was
simply
the
logical
result
of
his
care
i
saw
the
invoice
and
took
note
of
it
fifty
cases
of
common
earth
to
be
used
for
experimental
purposes
also
the
copy
of
letter
to
carter
paterson
and
their
reply
of
both
of
these
i
got
copies
this
was
all
the
information
mr
billington
could
give
me
so
i
went
down
to
the
port
and
saw
the
coastguards
the
customs
officers
and
the
harbourmaster
they
had
all
something
to
say
of
the
strange
entry
of
the
ship
which
is
already
taking
its
place
in
local
tradition
but
no
one
could
add
to
the
simple
description
fifty
cases
of
common
earth
i
then
saw
the
stationmaster
who
kindly
put
me
in
communication
with
the
men
who
had
actually
received
the
boxes
their
tally
was
exact
with
the
list
and
they
had
nothing
to
add
except
that
the
boxes
were
main
and
mortal
heavy
and
that
shifting
them
was
dry
work
one
of
them
added
that
it
was
hard
lines
that
there
wasnt
any
gentleman
suchlike
as
yourself
squire
to
show
some
sort
of
appreciation
of
their
efforts
in
a
liquid
form
another
put
in
a
rider
that
the
thirst
then
generated
was
such
that
even
the
time
which
had
elapsed
had
not
completely
allayed
it
needless
to
add
i
took
care
before
leaving
to
lift
for
ever
and
adequately
this
source
of
reproach





30
septemberthe
stationmaster
was
good
enough
to
give
me
a
line
to
his
old
companion
the
stationmaster
at
kings
cross
so
that
when
i
arrived
there
in
the
morning
i
was
able
to
ask
him
about
the
arrival
of
the
boxes
he
too
put
me
at
once
in
communication
with
the
proper
officials
and
i
saw
that
their
tally
was
correct
with
the
original
invoice
the
opportunities
of
acquiring
an
abnormal
thirst
had
been
here
limited
a
noble
use
of
them
had
however
been
made
and
again
i
was
compelled
to
deal
with
the
result
in
an
ex
post
facto
manner
from
thence
i
went
on
to
carter
patersons
central
office
where
i
met
with
the
utmost
courtesy
they
looked
up
the
transaction
in
their
daybook
and
letterbook
and
at
once
telephoned
to
their
kings
cross
office
for
more
details
by
good
fortune
the
men
who
did
the
teaming
were
waiting
for
work
and
the
official
at
once
sent
them
over
sending
also
by
one
of
them
the
waybill
and
all
the
papers
connected
with
the
delivery
of
the
boxes
at
carfax
here
again
i
found
the
tally
agreeing
exactly
the
carriers
men
were
able
to
supplement
the
paucity
of
the
written
words
with
a
few
details
these
were
i
shortly
found
connected
almost
solely
with
the
dusty
nature
of
the
job
and
of
the
consequent
thirst
engendered
in
the
operators
on
my
affording
an
opportunity
through
the
medium
of
the
currency
of
the
realm
of
the
allaying
at
a
later
period
this
beneficial
evil
one
of
the
men
remarked
that
ere
ouse
guvnor
is
the
rummiest
i
ever
was
in
blyme
but
it
aint
been
touched
sence
a
hundred
years
there
was
dust
that
thick
in
the
place
that
you
might
have
slep
on
it
without
urtin
of
yer
bones
an

neglected

the

took

me
and
my
mate
we
thort
we
wouldnt
never

i
wouldnt
take
less
nor
a
quid
a
moment
to
stay
there
arter
dark
having
been
in
the
house
i
could
well
believe
him
but
if
he
knew
what
i
know
he
would
i
think
have
raised
his
terms
of
one
thing
i
am
now
satisfied
that
all
the
boxes
which
arrived
at
whitby
from
varna
in
the
demeter
were
safely
deposited
in
the
old
chapel
at
carfax
there
should
be
fifty
of
them
there
unless
any
have
since
been
removedas
from
dr
sewards
diary
i
fear
i
shall
try
to
see
the
carter
who
took
away
the
boxes
from
carfax
when
renfield
attacked
them
by
following
up
this
clue
we
may
learn
a
good
deal





latermina
and
i
have
worked
all
day
and
we
have
put
all
the
papers
into
order

harkers
journal
30
septemberi
am
so
glad
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
contain
myself
it
is
i
suppose
the
reaction
from
the
haunting
fear
which
i
have
had
that
this
terrible
affair
and
the
reopening
of
his
old
wound
might
act
detrimentally
on
jonathan
i
saw
him
leave
for
whitby
with
as
brave
a
face
as
i
could
but
i
was
sick
with
apprehension
the
effort
has
however
done
him
good
he
was
never
so
resolute
never
so
strong
never
so
full
of
volcanic
energy
as
at
present
it
is
just
as
that
dear
good
professor
van
helsing
said
he
is
true
grit
and
he
improves
under
strain
that
would
kill
a
weaker
nature
he
came
back
full
of
life
and
hope
and
determination
we
have
got
everything
in
order
for
tonight
i
feel
myself
quite
wild
with
excitement
i
suppose
one
ought
to
pity
any
thing
so
hunted
as
is
the
count
that
is
just
it
this
thing
is
not
humannot
even
beast
to
read
dr
sewards
account
of
poor
lucys
death
and
what
followed
is
enough
to
dry
up
the
springs
of
pity
in
ones
heart





laterlord
godalming
and
mr
morris
arrived
earlier
than
we
expected
dr
seward
was
out
on
business
and
had
taken
jonathan
with
him
so
i
had
to
see
them
it
was
to
me
a
painful
meeting
for
it
brought
back
all
poor
dear
lucys
hopes
of
only
a
few
months
ago
of
course
they
had
heard
lucy
speak
of
me
and
it
seemed
that
dr
van
helsing
too
has
been
quite
blowing
my
trumpet
as
mr
morris
expressed
it
poor
fellows
neither
of
them
is
aware
that
i
know
all
about
the
proposals
they
made
to
lucy
they
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
or
do
as
they
were
ignorant
of
the
amount
of
my
knowledge
so
they
had
to
keep
on
neutral
subjects
however
i
thought
the
matter
over
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
post
them
in
affairs
right
up
to
date
i
knew
from
dr
sewards
diary
that
they
had
been
at
lucys
deathher
real
deathand
that
i
need
not
fear
to
betray
any
secret
before
the
time
so
i
told
them
as
well
as
i
could
that
i
had
read
all
the
papers
and
diaries
and
that
my
husband
and
i
having
typewritten
them
had
just
finished
putting
them
in
order
i
gave
them
each
a
copy
to
read
in
the
library
when
lord
godalming
got
his
and
turned
it
overit
does
make
a
pretty
good
pilehe
said
did
you
write
all
this
mrs
harker
i
nodded
and
he
went
on
i
dont
quite
see
the
drift
of
it
but
you
people
are
all
so
good
and
kind
and
have
been
working
so
earnestly
and
so
energetically
that
all
i
can
do
is
to
accept
your
ideas
blindfold
and
try
to
help
you
i
have
had
one
lesson
already
in
accepting
facts
that
should
make
a
man
humble
to
the
last
hour
of
his
life
besides
i
know
you
loved
my
poor
lucy
here
he
turned
away
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
could
hear
the
tears
in
his
voice
mr
morris
with
instinctive
delicacy
just
laid
a
hand
for
a
moment
on
his
shoulder
and
then
walked
quietly
out
of
the
room
i
suppose
there
is
something
in
womans
nature
that
makes
a
man
free
to
break
down
before
her
and
express
his
feelings
on
the
tender
or
emotional
side
without
feeling
it
derogatory
to
his
manhood
for
when
lord
godalming
found
himself
alone
with
me
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
gave
way
utterly
and
openly
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
i
hope
he
didnt
think
it
forward
of
me
and
that
if
he
ever
thinks
of
it
afterwards
he
never
will
have
such
a
thought
there
i
wrong
him
i
know
he
never
willhe
is
too
true
a
gentleman
i
said
to
him
for
i
could
see
that
his
heart
was
breaking
i
loved
dear
lucy
and
i
know
what
she
was
to
you
and
what
you
were
to
her
she
and
i
were
like
sisters
and
now
she
is
gone
will
you
not
let
me
be
like
a
sister
to
you
in
your
trouble
i
know
what
sorrows
you
have
had
though
i
cannot
measure
the
depth
of
them
if
sympathy
and
pity
can
help
in
your
affliction
wont
you
let
me
be
of
some
little
servicefor
lucys
sake
in
an
instant
the
poor
dear
fellow
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
that
he
had
of
late
been
suffering
in
silence
found
a
vent
at
once
he
grew
quite
hysterical
and
raising
his
open
hands
beat
his
palms
together
in
a
perfect
agony
of
grief
he
stood
up
and
then
sat
down
again
and
the
tears
rained
down
his
cheeks
i
felt
an
infinite
pity
for
him
and
opened
my
arms
unthinkingly
with
a
sob
he
laid
his
head
on
my
shoulder
and
cried
like
a
wearied
child
whilst
he
shook
with
emotion
we
women
have
something
of
the
mother
in
us
that
makes
us
rise
above
smaller
matters
when
the
motherspirit
is
invoked
i
felt
this
big
sorrowing
mans
head
resting
on
me
as
though
it
were
that
of
the
baby
that
some
day
may
lie
on
my
bosom
and
i
stroked
his
hair
as
though
he
were
my
own
child
i
never
thought
at
the
time
how
strange
it
all
was
after
a
little
bit
his
sobs
ceased
and
he
raised
himself
with
an
apology
though
he
made
no
disguise
of
his
emotion
he
told
me
that
for
days
and
nights
pastweary
days
and
sleepless
nightshe
had
been
unable
to
speak
with
any
one
as
a
man
must
speak
in
his
time
of
sorrow
there
was
no
woman
whose
sympathy
could
be
given
to
him
or
with
whom
owing
to
the
terrible
circumstance
with
which
his
sorrow
was
surrounded
he
could
speak
freely
i
know
now
how
i
suffered
he
said
as
he
dried
his
eyes
but
i
do
not
know
even
yetand
none
other
can
ever
knowhow
much
your
sweet
sympathy
has
been
to
me
today
i
shall
know
better
in
time
and
believe
me
that
though
i
am
not
ungrateful
now
my
gratitude
will
grow
with
my
understanding
you
will
let
me
be
like
a
brother
will
you
not
for
all
our
livesfor
dear
lucys
sake
for
dear
lucys
sake
i
said
as
we
clasped
hands
ay
and
for
your
own
sake
he
added
for
if
a
mans
esteem
and
gratitude
are
ever
worth
the
winning
you
have
won
mine
today
if
ever
the
future
should
bring
to
you
a
time
when
you
need
a
mans
help
believe
me
you
will
not
call
in
vain
god
grant
that
no
such
time
may
ever
come
to
you
to
break
the
sunshine
of
your
life
but
if
it
should
ever
come
promise
me
that
you
will
let
me
know
he
was
so
earnest
and
his
sorrow
was
so
fresh
that
i
felt
it
would
comfort
him
so
i
said
i
promise
as
i
came
along
the
corridor
i
saw
mr
morris
looking
out
of
a
window
he
turned
as
he
heard
my
footsteps
how
is
art
he
said
then
noticing
my
red
eyes
he
went
on
ah
i
see
you
have
been
comforting
him
poor
old
fellow
he
needs
it
no
one
but
a
woman
can
help
a
man
when
he
is
in
trouble
of
the
heart
and
he
had
no
one
to
comfort
him
he
bore
his
own
trouble
so
bravely
that
my
heart
bled
for
him
i
saw
the
manuscript
in
his
hand
and
i
knew
that
when
he
read
it
he
would
realise
how
much
i
knew
so
i
said
to
him
i
wish
i
could
comfort
all
who
suffer
from
the
heart
will
you
let
me
be
your
friend
and
will
you
come
to
me
for
comfort
if
you
need
it
you
will
know
later
on
why
i
speak
he
saw
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
stooping
took
my
hand
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
kissed
it
it
seemed
but
poor
comfort
to
so
brave
and
unselfish
a
soul
and
impulsively
i
bent
over
and
kissed
him
the
tears
rose
in
his
eyes
and
there
was
a
momentary
choking
in
his
throat
he
said
quite
calmly
little
girl
you
will
never
regret
that
truehearted
kindness
so
long
as
ever
you
live
then
he
went
into
the
study
to
his
friend
little
girlthe
very
words
he
had
used
to
lucy
and
oh
but
he
proved
himself
a
friend

30
septemberi
got
home
at
five
oclock
and
found
that
godalming
and
morris
had
not
only
arrived
but
had
already
studied
the
transcript
of
the
various
diaries
and
letters
which
harker
and
his
wonderful
wife
had
made
and
arranged
harker
had
not
yet
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
carriers
men
of
whom
dr
hennessey
had
written
to
me
mrs
harker
gave
us
a
cup
of
tea
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
lived
in
it
this
old
house
seemed
like
home
when
we
had
finished
mrs
harker
said
dr
seward
may
i
ask
a
favour
i
want
to
see
your
patient
mr
renfield
do
let
me
see
him
what
you
have
said
of
him
in
your
diary
interests
me
so
much
she
looked
so
appealing
and
so
pretty
that
i
could
not
refuse
her
and
there
was
no
possible
reason
why
i
should
so
i
took
her
with
me
when
i
went
into
the
room
i
told
the
man
that
a
lady
would
like
to
see
him
to
which
he
simply
answered
why
she
is
going
through
the
house
and
wants
to
see
every
one
in
it
i
answered
oh
very
well
he
said
let
her
come
in
by
all
means
but
just
wait
a
minute
till
i
tidy
up
the
place
his
method
of
tidying
was
peculiar
he
simply
swallowed
all
the
flies
and
spiders
in
the
boxes
before
i
could
stop
him
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
feared
or
was
jealous
of
some
interference
when
he
had
got
through
his
disgusting
task
he
said
cheerfully
let
the
lady
come
in
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
with
his
head
down
but
with
his
eyelids
raised
so
that
he
could
see
her
as
she
entered
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
he
might
have
some
homicidal
intent
i
remembered
how
quiet
he
had
been
just
before
he
attacked
me
in
my
own
study
and
i
took
care
to
stand
where
i
could
seize
him
at
once
if
he
attempted
to
make
a
spring
at
her
she
came
into
the
room
with
an
easy
gracefulness
which
would
at
once
command
the
respect
of
any
lunaticfor
easiness
is
one
of
the
qualities
mad
people
most
respect
she
walked
over
to
him
smiling
pleasantly
and
held
out
her
hand
goodevening
mr
renfield
said
she
you
see
i
know
you
for
dr
seward
has
told
me
of
you
he
made
no
immediate
reply
but
eyed
her
all
over
intently
with
a
set
frown
on
his
face
this
look
gave
way
to
one
of
wonder
which
merged
in
doubt
then
to
my
intense
astonishment
he
said
youre
not
the
girl
the
doctor
wanted
to
marry
are
you
you
cant
be
you
know
for
shes
dead
mrs
harker
smiled
sweetly
as
she
replied
oh
no
i
have
a
husband
of
my
own
to
whom
i
was
married
before
i
ever
saw
dr
seward
or
he
me
i
am
mrs
harker
then
what
are
you
doing
here
my
husband
and
i
are
staying
on
a
visit
with
dr
seward
then
dont
stay
but
why
not
i
thought
that
this
style
of
conversation
might
not
be
pleasant
to
mrs
harker
any
more
than
it
was
to
me
so
i
joined
in
how
did
you
know
i
wanted
to
marry
any
one
his
reply
was
simply
contemptuous
given
in
a
pause
in
which
he
turned
his
eyes
from
mrs
harker
to
me
instantly
turning
them
back
again
what
an
asinine
question
i
dont
see
that
at
all
mr
renfield
said
mrs
harker
at
once
championing
me
he
replied
to
her
with
as
much
courtesy
and
respect
as
he
had
shown
contempt
to
me
you
will
of
course
understand
mrs
harker
that
when
a
man
is
so
loved
and
honoured
as
our
host
is
everything
regarding
him
is
of
interest
in
our
little
community
dr
seward
is
loved
not
only
by
his
household
and
his
friends
but
even
by
his
patients
who
being
some
of
them
hardly
in
mental
equilibrium
are
apt
to
distort
causes
and
effects
since
i
myself
have
been
an
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum
i
cannot
but
notice
that
the
sophistic
tendencies
of
some
of
its
inmates
lean
towards
the
errors
of
non
causa
and
ignoratio
elenchi
i
positively
opened
my
eyes
at
this
new
development
here
was
my
own
pet
lunaticthe
most
pronounced
of
his
type
that
i
had
ever
met
withtalking
elemental
philosophy
and
with
the
manner
of
a
polished
gentleman
i
wonder
if
it
was
mrs
harkers
presence
which
had
touched
some
chord
in
his
memory
if
this
new
phase
was
spontaneous
or
in
any
way
due
to
her
unconscious
influence
she
must
have
some
rare
gift
or
power
we
continued
to
talk
for
some
time
and
seeing
that
he
was
seemingly
quite
reasonable
she
ventured
looking
at
me
questioningly
as
she
began
to
lead
him
to
his
favourite
topic
i
was
again
astonished
for
he
addressed
himself
to
the
question
with
the
impartiality
of
the
completest
sanity
he
even
took
himself
as
an
example
when
he
mentioned
certain
things
why
i
myself
am
an
instance
of
a
man
who
had
a
strange
belief
indeed
it
was
no
wonder
that
my
friends
were
alarmed
and
insisted
on
my
being
put
under
control
i
used
to
fancy
that
life
was
a
positive
and
perpetual
entity
and
that
by
consuming
a
multitude
of
live
things
no
matter
how
low
in
the
scale
of
creation
one
might
indefinitely
prolong
life
at
times
i
held
the
belief
so
strongly
that
i
actually
tried
to
take
human
life
the
doctor
here
will
bear
me
out
that
on
one
occasion
i
tried
to
kill
him
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
my
vital
powers
by
the
assimilation
with
my
own
body
of
his
life
through
the
medium
of
his
bloodrelying
of
course
upon
the
scriptural
phrase
for
the
blood
is
the
life
though
indeed
the
vendor
of
a
certain
nostrum
has
vulgarised
the
truism
to
the
very
point
of
contempt
isnt
that
true
doctor
i
nodded
assent
for
i
was
so
amazed
that
i
hardly
knew
what
to
either
think
or
say
it
was
hard
to
imagine
that
i
had
seen
him
eat
up
his
spiders
and
flies
not
five
minutes
before
looking
at
my
watch
i
saw
that
i
should
go
to
the
station
to
meet
van
helsing
so
i
told
mrs
harker
that
it
was
time
to
leave
she
came
at
once
after
saying
pleasantly
to
mr
renfield
goodbye
and
i
hope
i
may
see
you
often
under
auspices
pleasanter
to
yourself
to
which
to
my
astonishment
he
replied
goodbye
my
dear
i
pray
god
i
may
never
see
your
sweet
face
again
may
he
bless
and
keep
you
when
i
went
to
the
station
to
meet
van
helsing
i
left
the
boys
behind
me
poor
art
seemed
more
cheerful
than
he
has
been
since
lucy
first
took
ill
and
quincey
is
more
like
his
own
bright
self
than
he
has
been
for
many
a
long
day
van
helsing
stepped
from
the
carriage
with
the
eager
nimbleness
of
a
boy
he
saw
me
at
once
and
rushed
up
to
me
saying
ah
friend
john
how
goes
all
well
so
i
have
been
busy
for
i
come
here
to
stay
if
need
be
all
affairs
are
settled
with
me
and
i
have
much
to
tell
madam
mina
is
with
you
yes
and
her
so
fine
husband
and
arthur
and
my
friend
quincey
they
are
with
you
too
good
as
i
drove
to
the
house
i
told
him
of
what
had
passed
and
of
how
my
own
diary
had
come
to
be
of
some
use
through
mrs
harkers
suggestion
at
which
the
professor
interrupted
me
ah
that
wonderful
madam
mina
she
has
mans
braina
brain
that
a
man
should
have
were
he
much
giftedand
a
womans
heart
the
good
god
fashioned
her
for
a
purpose
believe
me
when
he
made
that
so
good
combination
friend
john
up
to
now
fortune
has
made
that
woman
of
help
to
us
after
tonight
she
must
not
have
to
do
with
this
so
terrible
affair
it
is
not
good
that
she
run
a
risk
so
great
we
men
are
determinednay
are
we
not
pledgedto
destroy
this
monster
but
it
is
no
part
for
a
woman
even
if
she
be
not
harmed
her
heart
may
fail
her
in
so
much
and
so
many
horrors
and
hereafter
she
may
sufferboth
in
waking
from
her
nerves
and
in
sleep
from
her
dreams
and
besides
she
is
young
woman
and
not
so
long
married
there
may
be
other
things
to
think
of
some
time
if
not
now
you
tell
me
she
has
wrote
all
then
she
must
consult
with
us
but
tomorrow
she
say
goodbye
to
this
work
and
we
go
alone
i
agreed
heartily
with
him
and
then
i
told
him
what
we
had
found
in
his
absence
that
the
house
which
dracula
had
bought
was
the
very
next
one
to
my
own
he
was
amazed
and
a
great
concern
seemed
to
come
on
him
oh
that
we
had
known
it
before
he
said
for
then
we
might
have
reached
him
in
time
to
save
poor
lucy
however
the
milk
that
is
spilt
cries
not
out
afterwards
as
you
say
we
shall
not
think
of
that
but
go
on
our
way
to
the
end
then
he
fell
into
a
silence
that
lasted
till
we
entered
my
own
gateway
before
we
went
to
prepare
for
dinner
he
said
to
mrs
harker
i
am
told
madam
mina
by
my
friend
john
that
you
and
your
husband
have
put
up
in
exact
order
all
things
that
have
been
up
to
this
moment
not
up
to
this
moment
professor
she
said
impulsively
but
up
to
this
morning
but
why
not
up
to
now
we
have
seen
hitherto
how
good
light
all
the
little
things
have
made
we
have
told
our
secrets
and
yet
no
one
who
has
told
is
the
worse
for
it
mrs
harker
began
to
blush
and
taking
a
paper
from
her
pockets
she
said
dr
van
helsing
will
you
read
this
and
tell
me
if
it
must
go
in
it
is
my
record
of
today
i
too
have
seen
the
need
of
putting
down
at
present
everything
however
trivial
but
there
is
little
in
this
except
what
is
personal
must
it
go
in
the
professor
read
it
over
gravely
and
handed
it
back
saying
it
need
not
go
in
if
you
do
not
wish
it
but
i
pray
that
it
may
it
can
but
make
your
husband
love
you
the
more
and
all

septemberwhen
we
met
in
dr
sewards
study
two
hours
after
dinner
which
had
been
at
six
oclock
we
unconsciously
formed
a
sort
of
board
or
committee
professor
van
helsing
took
the
head
of
the
table
to
which
dr
seward
motioned
him
as
he
came
into
the
room
he
made
me
sit
next
to
him
on
his
right
and
asked
me
to
act
as
secretary
jonathan
sat
next
to
me
opposite
us
were
lord
godalming
dr
seward
and
mr
morrislord
godalming
being
next
the
professor
and
dr
seward
in
the
centre
the
professor
said
i
may
i
suppose
take
it
that
we
are
all
acquainted
with
the
facts
that
are
in
these
papers
we
all
expressed
assent
and
he
went
on
then
it
were
i
think
good
that
i
tell
you
something
of
the
kind
of
enemy
with
which
we
have
to
deal
i
shall
then
make
known
to
you
something
of
the
history
of
this
man
which
has
been
ascertained
for
me
so
we
then
can
discuss
how
we
shall
act
and
can
take
our
measure
according
there
are
such
beings
as
vampires
some
of
us
have
evidence
that
they
exist
even
had
we
not
the
proof
of
our
own
unhappy
experience
the
teachings
and
the
records
of
the
past
give
proof
enough
for
sane
peoples
i
admit
that
at
the
first
i
was
sceptic
were
it
not
that
through
long
years
i
have
train
myself
to
keep
an
open
mind
i
could
not
have
believe
until
such
time
as
that
fact
thunder
on
my
ear
see
see
i
prove
i
prove
alas
had
i
known
at
the
first
what
now
i
knownay
had
i
even
guess
at
himone
so
precious
life
had
been
spared
to
many
of
us
who
did
love
her
but
that
is
gone
and
we
must
so
work
that
other
poor
souls
perish
not
whilst
we
can
save
the
nosferatu
do
not
die
like
the
bee
when
he
sting
once
he
is
only
stronger
and
being
stronger
have
yet
more
power
to
work
evil
this
vampire
which
is
amongst
us
is
of
himself
so
strong
in
person
as
twenty
men
he
is
of
cunning
more
than
mortal
for
his
cunning
be
the
growth
of
ages
he
have
still
the
aids
of
necromancy
which
is
as
his
etymology
imply
the
divination
by
the
dead
and
all
the
dead
that
he
can
come
nigh
to
are
for
him
at
command
he
is
brute
and
more
than
brute
he
is
devil
in
callous
and
the
heart
of
him
is
not
he
can
within
limitations
appear
at
will
when
and
where
and
in
any
of
the
forms
that
are
to
him
he
can
within
his
range
direct
the
elements
the
storm
the
fog
the
thunder
he
can
command
all
the
meaner
things
the
rat
and
the
owl
and
the
batthe
moth
and
the
fox
and
the
wolf
he
can
grow
and
become
small
and
he
can
at
times
vanish
and
come
unknown
how
then
are
we
to
begin
our
strike
to
destroy
him
how
shall
we
find
his
where
and
having
found
it
how
can
we
destroy
my
friends
this
is
much
it
is
a
terrible
task
that
we
undertake
and
there
may
be
consequence
to
make
the
brave
shudder
for
if
we
fail
in
this
our
fight
he
must
surely
win
and
then
where
end
we
life
is
nothings
i
heed
him
not
but
to
fail
here
is
not
mere
life
or
death
it
is
that
we
become
as
him
that
we
henceforward
become
foul
things
of
the
night
like
himwithout
heart
or
conscience
preying
on
the
bodies
and
the
souls
of
those
we
love
best
to
us
for
ever
are
the
gates
of
heaven
shut
for
who
shall
open
them
to
us
again
we
go
on
for
all
time
abhorred
by
all
a
blot
on
the
face
of
gods
sunshine
an
arrow
in
the
side
of
him
who
died
for
man
but
we
are
face
to
face
with
duty
and
in
such
case
must
we
shrink
for
me
i
say
no
but
then
i
am
old
and
life
with
his
sunshine
his
fair
places
his
song
of
birds
his
music
and
his
love
lie
far
behind
you
others
are
young
some
have
seen
sorrow
but
there
are
fair
days
yet
in
store
what
say
you
whilst
he
was
speaking
jonathan
had
taken
my
hand
i
feared
oh
so
much
that
the
appalling
nature
of
our
danger
was
overcoming
him
when
i
saw
his
hand
stretch
out
but
it
was
life
to
me
to
feel
its
touchso
strong
so
selfreliant
so
resolute
a
brave
mans
hand
can
speak
for
itself
it
does
not
even
need
a
womans
love
to
hear
its
music
when
the
professor
had
done
speaking
my
husband
looked
in
my
eyes
and
i
in
his
there
was
no
need
for
speaking
between
us
i
answer
for
mina
and
myself
he
said
count
me
in
professor
said
mr
quincey
morris
laconically
as
usual
i
am
with
you
said
lord
godalming
for
lucys
sake
if
for
no
other
reason
dr
seward
simply
nodded
the
professor
stood
up
and
after
laying
his
golden
crucifix
on
the
table
held
out
his
hand
on
either
side
i
took
his
right
hand
and
lord
godalming
his
left
jonathan
held
my
right
with
his
left
and
stretched
across
to
mr
morris
so
as
we
all
took
hands
our
solemn
compact
was
made
i
felt
my
heart
icy
cold
but
it
did
not
even
occur
to
me
to
draw
back
we
resumed
our
places
and
dr
van
helsing
went
on
with
a
sort
of
cheerfulness
which
showed
that
the
serious
work
had
begun
it
was
to
be
taken
as
gravely
and
in
as
businesslike
a
way
as
any
other
transaction
of
life
well
you
know
what
we
have
to
contend
against
but
we
too
are
not
without
strength
we
have
on
our
side
power
of
combinationa
power
denied
to
the
vampire
kind
we
have
sources
of
science
we
are
free
to
act
and
think
and
the
hours
of
the
day
and
the
night
are
ours
equally
in
fact
so
far
as
our
powers
extend
they
are
unfettered
and
we
are
free
to
use
them
we
have
selfdevotion
in
a
cause
and
an
end
to
achieve
which
is
not
a
selfish
one
these
things
are
much
now
let
us
see
how
far
the
general
powers
arrayed
against
us
are
restrict
and
how
the
individual
cannot
in
fine
let
us
consider
the
limitations
of
the
vampire
in
general
and
of
this
one
in
particular
all
we
have
to
go
upon
are
traditions
and
superstitions
these
do
not
at
the
first
appear
much
when
the
matter
is
one
of
life
and
deathnay
of
more
than
either
life
or
death
yet
must
we
be
satisfied
in
the
first
place
because
we
have
to
beno
other
means
is
at
our
controland
secondly
because
after
all
these
thingstradition
and
superstitionare
everything
does
not
the
belief
in
vampires
rest
for
othersthough
not
alas
for
uson
them
a
year
ago
which
of
us
would
have
received
such
a
possibility
in
the
midst
of
our
scientific
sceptical
matteroffact
nineteenth
century
we
even
scouted
a
belief
that
we
saw
justified
under
our
very
eyes
take
it
then
that
the
vampire
and
the
belief
in
his
limitations
and
his
cure
rest
for
the
moment
on
the
same
base
for
let
me
tell
you
he
is
known
everywhere
that
men
have
been
in
old
greece
in
old
rome
he
flourish
in
germany
all
over
in
france
in
india
even
in
the
chernosese
and
in
china
so
far
from
us
in
all
ways
there
even
is
he
and
the
peoples
fear
him
at
this
day
he
have
follow
the
wake
of
the
berserker
icelander
the
devilbegotten
hun
the
slav
the
saxon
the
magyar
so
far
then
we
have
all
we
may
act
upon
and
let
me
tell
you
that
very
much
of
the
beliefs
are
justified
by
what
we
have
seen
in
our
own
so
unhappy
experience
the
vampire
live
on
and
cannot
die
by
mere
passing
of
the
time
he
can
flourish
when
that
he
can
fatten
on
the
blood
of
the
living
even
more
we
have
seen
amongst
us
that
he
can
even
grow
younger
that
his
vital
faculties
grow
strenuous
and
seem
as
though
they
refresh
themselves
when
his
special
pabulum
is
plenty
but
he
cannot
flourish
without
this
diet
he
eat
not
as
others
even
friend
jonathan
who
lived
with
him
for
weeks
did
never
see
him
to
eat
never
he
throws
no
shadow
he
make
in
the
mirror
no
reflect
as
again
jonathan
observe
he
has
the
strength
of
many
of
his
handwitness
again
jonathan
when
he
shut
the
door
against
the
wolfs
and
when
he
help
him
from
the
diligence
too
he
can
transform
himself
to
wolf
as
we
gather
from
the
ship
arrival
in
whitby
when
he
tear
open
the
dog
he
can
be
as
bat
as
madam
mina
saw
him
on
the
window
at
whitby
and
as
friend
john
saw
him
fly
from
this
so
near
house
and
as
my
friend
quincey
saw
him
at
the
window
of
miss
lucy
he
can
come
in
mist
which
he
createthat
noble
ships
captain
proved
him
of
this
but
from
what
we
know
the
distance
he
can
make
this
mist
is
limited
and
it
can
only
be
round
himself
he
come
on
moonlight
rays
as
elemental
dustas
again
jonathan
saw
those
sisters
in
the
castle
of
dracula
he
become
so
smallwe
ourselves
saw
miss
lucy
ere
she
was
at
peace
slip
through
a
hairbreadth
space
at
the
tomb
door
he
can
when
once
he
find
his
way
come
out
from
anything
or
into
anything
no
matter
how
close
it
be
bound
or
even
fused
up
with
firesolder
you
call
it
he
can
see
in
the
darkno
small
power
this
in
a
world
which
is
one
half
shut
from
the
light
ah
but
hear
me
through
he
can
do
all
these
things
yet
he
is
not
free
nay
he
is
even
more
prisoner
than
the
slave
of
the
galley
than
the
madman
in
his
cell
he
cannot
go
where
he
lists
he
who
is
not
of
nature
has
yet
to
obey
some
of
natures
lawswhy
we
know
not
he
may
not
enter
anywhere
at
the
first
unless
there
be
some
one
of
the
household
who
bid
him
to
come
though
afterwards
he
can
come
as
he
please
his
power
ceases
as
does
that
of
all
evil
things
at
the
coming
of
the
day
only
at
certain
times
can
he
have
limited
freedom
if
he
be
not
at
the
place
whither
he
is
bound
he
can
only
change
himself
at
noon
or
at
exact
sunrise
or
sunset
these
things
are
we
told
and
in
this
record
of
ours
we
have
proof
by
inference
thus
whereas
he
can
do
as
he
will
within
his
limit
when
he
have
his
earthhome
his
coffinhome
his
hellhome
the
place
unhallowed
as
we
saw
when
he
went
to
the
grave
of
the
suicide
at
whitby
still
at
other
time
he
can
only
change
when
the
time
come
it
is
said
too
that
he
can
only
pass
running
water
at
the
slack
or
the
flood
of
the
tide
then
there
are
things
which
so
afflict
him
that
he
has
no
power
as
the
garlic
that
we
know
of
and
as
for
things
sacred
as
this
symbol
my
crucifix
that
was
amongst
us
even
now
when
we
resolve
to
them
he
is
nothing
but
in
their
presence
he
take
his
place
far
off
and
silent
with
respect
there
are
others
too
which
i
shall
tell
you
of
lest
in
our
seeking
we
may
need
them
the
branch
of
wild
rose
on
his
coffin
keep
him
that
he
move
not
from
it
a
sacred
bullet
fired
into
the
coffin
kill
him
so
that
he
be
true
dead
and
as
for
the
stake
through
him
we
know
already
of
its
peace
or
the
cutoff
head
that
giveth
rest
we
have
seen
it
with
our
eyes
thus
when
we
find
the
habitation
of
this
manthatwas
we
can
confine
him
to
his
coffin
and
destroy
him
if
we
obey
what
we
know
but
he
is
clever
i
have
asked
my
friend
arminius
of
budapesth
university
to
make
his
record
and
from
all
the
means
that
are
he
tell
me
of
what
he
has
been
he
must
indeed
have
been
that
voivode
dracula
who
won
his
name
against
the
turk
over
the
great
river
on
the
very
frontier
of
turkeyland
if
it
be
so
then
was
he
no
common
man
for
in
that
time
and
for
centuries
after
he
was
spoken
of
as
the
cleverest
and
the
most
cunning
as
well
as
the
bravest
of
the
sons
of
the
land
beyond
the
forest
that
mighty
brain
and
that
iron
resolution
went
with
him
to
his
grave
and
are
even
now
arrayed
against
us
the
draculas
were
says
arminius
a
great
and
noble
race
though
now
and
again
were
scions
who
were
held
by
their
coevals
to
have
had
dealings
with
the
evil
one
they
learned
his
secrets
in
the
scholomance
amongst
the
mountains
over
lake
hermanstadt
where
the
devil
claims
the
tenth
scholar
as
his
due
in
the
records
are
such
words
as
stregoicawitch
ordog
and
pokolsatan
and
hell
and
in
one
manuscript
this
very
dracula
is
spoken
of
as
wampyr
which
we
all
understand
too
well
there
have
been
from
the
loins
of
this
very
one
great
men
and
good
women
and
their
graves
make
sacred
the
earth
where
alone
this
foulness
can
dwell
for
it
is
not
the
least
of
its
terrors
that
this
evil
thing
is
rooted
deep
in
all
good
in
soil
barren
of
holy
memories
it
cannot
rest
whilst
they
were
talking
mr
morris
was
looking
steadily
at
the
window
and
he
now
got
up
quietly
and
went
out
of
the
room
there
was
a
little
pause
and
then
the
professor
went
on
and
now
we
must
settle
what
we
do
we
have
here
much
data
and
we
must
proceed
to
lay
out
our
campaign
we
know
from
the
inquiry
of
jonathan
that
from
the
castle
to
whitby
came
fifty
boxes
of
earth
all
of
which
were
delivered
at
carfax
we
also
know
that
at
least
some
of
these
boxes
have
been
removed
it
seems
to
me
that
our
first
step
should
be
to
ascertain
whether
all
the
rest
remain
in
the
house
beyond
that
wall
where
we
look
today
or
whether
any
more
have
been
removed
if
the
latter
we
must
trace
here
we
were
interrupted
in
a
very
startling
way
outside
the
house
came
the
sound
of
a
pistolshot
the
glass
of
the
window
was
shattered
with
a
bullet
which
ricochetting
from
the
top
of
the
embrasure
struck
the
far
wall
of
the
room
i
am
afraid
i
am
at
heart
a
coward
for
i
shrieked
out
the
men
all
jumped
to
their
feet
lord
godalming
flew
over
to
the
window
and
threw
up
the
sash
as
he
did
so
we
heard
mr
morriss
voice
without
sorry
i
fear
i
have
alarmed
you
i
shall
come
in
and
tell
you
about
it
a
minute
later
he
came
in
and
said
it
was
an
idiotic
thing
of
me
to
do
and
i
ask
your
pardon
mrs
harker
most
sincerely
i
fear
i
must
have
frightened
you
terribly
but
the
fact
is
that
whilst
the
professor
was
talking
there
came
a
big
bat
and
sat
on
the
windowsill
i
have
got
such
a
horror
of
the
damned
brutes
from
recent
events
that
i
cannot
stand
them
and
i
went
out
to
have
a
shot
as
i
have
been
doing
of
late
of
evenings
whenever
i
have
seen
one
you
used
to
laugh
at
me
for
it
then
art
did
you
hit
it
asked
dr
van
helsing
i
dont
know
i
fancy
not
for
it
flew
away
into
the
wood
without
saying
any
more
he
took
his
seat
and
the
professor
began
to
resume
his
statement
we
must
trace
each
of
these
boxes
and
when
we
are
ready
we
must
either
capture
or
kill
this
monster
in
his
lair
or
we
must
so
to
speak
sterilise
the
earth
so
that
no
more
he
can
seek
safety
in
it
thus
in
the
end
we
may
find
him
in
his
form
of
man
between
the
hours
of
noon
and
sunset
and
so
engage
with
him
when
he
is
at
his
most
weak
and
now
for
you
madam
mina
this
night
is
the
end
until
all
be
well
you
are
too
precious
to
us
to
have
such
risk
when
we
part
tonight
you
no
more
must
question
we
shall
tell
you
all
in
good
time
we
are
men
and
are
able
to
bear
but
you
must
be
our
star
and
our
hope
and
we
shall
act
all
the
more
free
that
you
are
not
in
the
danger
such
as
we
are
all
the
men
even
jonathan
seemed
relieved
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
good
that
they
should
brave
danger
and
perhaps
lessen
their
safetystrength
being
the
best
safetythrough
care
of
me
but
their
minds
were
made
up
and
though
it
was
a
bitter
pill
for
me
to
swallow
i
could
say
nothing
save
to
accept
their
chivalrous
care
of
me
mr
morris
resumed
the
discussion
as
there
is
no
time
to
lose
i
vote
we
have
a
look
at
his
house
right
now
time
is
everything
with
him
and
swift
action
on
our
part
may
save
another
victim
i
own
that
my
heart
began
to
fail
me
when
the
time
for
action
came
so
close
but
i
did
not
say
anything
for
i
had
a
greater
fear
that
if
i
appeared
as
a
drag
or
a
hindrance
to
their
work
they
might
even
leave
me
out
of
their
counsels
altogether
they
have
now
gone
off
to
carfax
with
means
to
get
into
the
house
manlike
they
had
told
me
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
as
if
a
woman
can
sleep
when
those
she
loves
are
in
danger
i
shall
lie
down
and
pretend
to
sleep
lest
jonathan
have
added
anxiety
about
me
when
he
returns
dr
sewards
diary
1
october

a
mjust
as
we
were
about
to
leave
the
house
an
urgent
message
was
brought
to
me
from
renfield
to
know
if
i
would
see
him
at
once
as
he
had
something
of
the
utmost
importance
to
say
to
me
i
told
the
messenger
to
say
that
i
would
attend
to
his
wishes
in
the
morning
i
was
busy
just
at
the
moment
the
attendant
added
he
seems
very
importunate
sir
i
have
never
seen
him
so
eager
i
dont
know
but
what
if
you
dont
see
him
soon
he
will
have
one
of
his
violent
fits
i
knew
the
man
would
not
have
said
this
without
some
cause
so
i
said
all
right
ill
go
now
and
i
asked
the
others
to
wait
a
few
minutes
for
me
as
i
had
to
go
and
see
my
patient
take
me
with
you
friend
john
said
the
professor
his
case
in
your
diary
interest
me
much
and
it
had
bearing
too
now
and
again
on
our
case
i
should
much
like
to
see
him
and
especial
when
his
mind
is
disturbed
may
i
come
also
asked
lord
godalming
me
too
said
quincey
morris
may
i
come
said
harker
i
nodded
and
we
all
went
down
the
passage
together
we
found
him
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
but
far
more
rational
in
his
speech
and
manner
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
there
was
an
unusual
understanding
of
himself
which
was
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
met
with
in
a
lunatic
and
he
took
it
for
granted
that
his
reasons
would
prevail
with
others
entirely
sane
we
all
four
went
into
the
room
but
none
of
the
others
at
first
said
anything
his
request
was
that
i
would
at
once
release
him
from
the
asylum
and
send
him
home
this
he
backed
up
with
arguments
regarding
his
complete
recovery
and
adduced
his
own
existing
sanity
i
appeal
to
your
friends
he
said
they
will
perhaps
not
mind
sitting
in
judgment
on
my
case
by
the
way
you
have
not
introduced
me
i
was
so
much
astonished
that
the
oddness
of
introducing
a
madman
in
an
asylum
did
not
strike
me
at
the
moment
and
besides
there
was
a
certain
dignity
in
the
mans
manner
so
much
of
the
habit
of
equality
that
i
at
once
made
the
introduction
lord
godalming
professor
van
helsing
mr
quincey
morris
of
texas
mr
renfield
he
shook
hands
with
each
of
them
saying
in
turn
lord
godalming
i
had
the
honour
of
seconding
your
father
at
the
windham
i
grieve
to
know
by
your
holding
the
title
that
he
is
no
more
he
was
a
man
loved
and
honoured
by
all
who
knew
him
and
in
his
youth
was
i
have
heard
the
inventor
of
a
burnt
rum
punch
much
patronised
on
derby
night
mr
morris
you
should
be
proud
of
your
great
state
its
reception
into
the
union
was
a
precedent
which
may
have
farreaching
effects
hereafter
when
the
pole
and
the
tropics
may
hold
alliance
to
the
stars
and
stripes
the
power
of
treaty
may
yet
prove
a
vast
engine
of
enlargement
when
the
monroe
doctrine
takes
its
true
place
as
a
political
fable
what
shall
any
man
say
of
his
pleasure
at
meeting
van
helsing
sir
i
make
no
apology
for
dropping
all
forms
of
conventional
prefix
when
an
individual
has
revolutionised
therapeutics
by
his
discovery
of
the
continuous
evolution
of
brainmatter
conventional
forms
are
unfitting
since
they
would
seem
to
limit
him
to
one
of
a
class
you
gentlemen
who
by
nationality
by
heredity
or
by
the
possession
of
natural
gifts
are
fitted
to
hold
your
respective
places
in
the
moving
world
i
take
to
witness
that
i
am
as
sane
as
at
least
the
majority
of
men
who
are
in
full
possession
of
their
liberties
and
i
am
sure
that
you
dr
seward
humanitarian
and
medicojurist
as
well
as
scientist
will
deem
it
a
moral
duty
to
deal
with
me
as
one
to
be
considered
as
under
exceptional
circumstances
he
made
this
last
appeal
with
a
courtly
air
of
conviction
which
was
not
without
its
own
charm
i
think
we
were
all
staggered
for
my
own
part
i
was
under
the
conviction
despite
my
knowledge
of
the
mans
character
and
history
that
his
reason
had
been
restored
and
i
felt
under
a
strong
impulse
to
tell
him
that
i
was
satisfied
as
to
his
sanity
and
would
see
about
the
necessary
formalities
for
his
release
in
the
morning
i
thought
it
better
to
wait
however
before
making
so
grave
a
statement
for
of
old
i
knew
the
sudden
changes
to
which
this
particular
patient
was
liable
so
i
contented
myself
with
making
a
general
statement
that
he
appeared
to
be
improving
very
rapidly
that
i
would
have
a
longer
chat
with
him
in
the
morning
and
would
then
see
what
i
could
do
in
the
direction
of
meeting
his
wishes
this
did
not
at
all
satisfy
him
for
he
said
quickly
but
i
fear
dr
seward
that
you
hardly
apprehend
my
wish
i
desire
to
go
at
onceherenowthis
very
hourthis
very
moment
if
i
may
time
presses
and
in
our
implied
agreement
with
the
old
scytheman
it
is
of
the
essence
of
the
contract
i
am
sure
it
is
only
necessary
to
put
before
so
admirable
a
practitioner
as
dr
seward
so
simple
yet
so
momentous
a
wish
to
ensure
its
fulfilment
he
looked
at
me
keenly
and
seeing
the
negative
in
my
face
turned
to
the
others
and
scrutinised
them
closely
not
meeting
any
sufficient
response
he
went
on
is
it
possible
that
i
have
erred
in
my
supposition
you
have
i
said
frankly
but
at
the
same
time
as
i
felt
brutally
there
was
a
considerable
pause
and
then
he
said
slowly
then
i
suppose
i
must
only
shift
my
ground
of
request
let
me
ask
for
this
concessionboon
privilege
what
you
will
i
am
content
to
implore
in
such
a
case
not
on
personal
grounds
but
for
the
sake
of
others
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
give
you
the
whole
of
my
reasons
but
you
may
i
assure
you
take
it
from
me
that
they
are
good
ones
sound
and
unselfish
and
spring
from
the
highest
sense
of
duty
could
you
look
sir
into
my
heart
you
would
approve
to
the
full
the
sentiments
which
animate
me
nay
more
you
would
count
me
amongst
the
best
and
truest
of
your
friends
again
he
looked
at
us
all
keenly
i
had
a
growing
conviction
that
this
sudden
change
of
his
entire
intellectual
method
was
but
yet
another
form
or
phase
of
his
madness
and
so
determined
to
let
him
go
on
a
little
longer
knowing
from
experience
that
he
would
like
all
lunatics
give
himself
away
in
the
end
van
helsing
was
gazing
at
him
with
a
look
of
utmost
intensity
his
bushy
eyebrows
almost
meeting
with
the
fixed
concentration
of
his
look
he
said
to
renfield
in
a
tone
which
did
not
surprise
me
at
the
time
but
only
when
i
thought
of
it
afterwardsfor
it
was
as
of
one
addressing
an
equal
can
you
not
tell
frankly
your
real
reason
for
wishing
to
be
free
tonight
i
will
undertake
that
if
you
will
satisfy
even
mea
stranger
without
prejudice
and
with
the
habit
of
keeping
an
open
minddr
seward
will
give
you
at
his
own
risk
and
on
his
own
responsibility
the
privilege
you
seek
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
with
a
look
of
poignant
regret
on
his
face
the
professor
went
on
come
sir
bethink
yourself
you
claim
the
privilege
of
reason
in
the
highest
degree
since
you
seek
to
impress
us
with
your
complete
reasonableness
you
do
this
whose
sanity
we
have
reason
to
doubt
since
you
are
not
yet
released
from
medical
treatment
for
this
very
defect
if
you
will
not
help
us
in
our
effort
to
choose
the
wisest
course
how
can
we
perform
the
duty
which
you
yourself
put
upon
us
be
wise
and
help
us
and
if
we
can
we
shall
aid
you
to
achieve
your
wish
he
still
shook
his
head
as
he
said
dr
van
helsing
i
have
nothing
to
say
your
argument
is
complete
and
if
i
were
free
to
speak
i
should
not
hesitate
a
moment
but
i
am
not
my
own
master
in
the
matter
i
can
only
ask
you
to
trust
me
if
i
am
refused
the
responsibility
does
not
rest
with
me
i
thought
it
was
now
time
to
end
the
scene
which
was
becoming
too
comically
grave
so
i
went
towards
the
door
simply
saying
come
my
friends
we
have
work
to
do
goodnight
as
however
i
got
near
the
door
a
new
change
came
over
the
patient
he
moved
towards
me
so
quickly
that
for
the
moment
i
feared
that
he
was
about
to
make
another
homicidal
attack
my
fears
however
were
groundless
for
he
held
up
his
two
hands
imploringly
and
made
his
petition
in
a
moving
manner
as
he
saw
that
the
very
excess
of
his
emotion
was
militating
against
him
by
restoring
us
more
to
our
old
relations
he
became
still
more
demonstrative
i
glanced
at
van
helsing
and
saw
my
conviction
reflected
in
his
eyes
so
i
became
a
little
more
fixed
in
my
manner
if
not
more
stern
and
motioned
to
him
that
his
efforts
were
unavailing
i
had
previously
seen
something
of
the
same
constantly
growing
excitement
in
him
when
he
had
to
make
some
request
of
which
at
the
time
he
had
thought
much
such
for
instance
as
when
he
wanted
a
cat
and
i
was
prepared
to
see
the
collapse
into
the
same
sullen
acquiescence
on
this
occasion
my
expectation
was
not
realised
for
when
he
found
that
his
appeal
would
not
be
successful
he
got
into
quite
a
frantic
condition
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
held
up
his
hands
wringing
them
in
plaintive
supplication
and
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
entreaty
with
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
and
his
whole
face
and
form
expressive
of
the
deepest
emotion
let
me
entreat
you
dr
seward
oh
let
me
implore
you
to
let
me
out
of
this
house
at
once
send
me
away
how
you
will
and
where
you
will
send
keepers
with
me
with
whips
and
chains
let
them
take
me
in
a
straitwaistcoat
manacled
and
legironed
even
to
a
gaol
but
let
me
go
out
of
this
you
dont
know
what
you
do
by
keeping
me
here
i
am
speaking
from
the
depths
of
my
heartof
my
very
soul
you
dont
know
whom
you
wrong
or
how
and
i
may
not
tell
woe
is
me
i
may
not
tell
by
all
you
hold
sacredby
all
you
hold
dearby
your
love
that
is
lostby
your
hope
that
livesfor
the
sake
of
the
almighty
take
me
out
of
this
and
save
my
soul
from
guilt
cant
you
hear
me
man
cant
you
understand
will
you
never
learn
dont
you
know
that
i
am
sane
and
earnest
now
that
i
am
no
lunatic
in
a
mad
fit
but
a
sane
man
fighting
for
his
soul
oh
hear
me
hear
me
let
me
go
let
me
go
let
me
go
i
thought
that
the
longer
this
went
on
the
wilder
he
would
get
and
so
would
bring
on
a
fit
so
i
took
him
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
up
come
i
said
sternly
no
more
of
this
we
have
had
quite
enough
already
get
to
your
bed
and
try
to
behave
more
discreetly
he
suddenly
stopped
and
looked
at
me
intently
for
several
moments
then
without
a
word
he
rose
and
moving
over
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
the
collapse
had
come
as
on
former
occasion
just
as
i
had
expected
when
i
was
leaving
the
room
last
of
our
party
he
said
to
me
in
a
quiet
wellbred
voice
you
will
i
trust
dr
seward
do
me
the
justice
to
bear
in
mind
later
on
that
i
did
what
i
could
to
convince
you
tonight

a
mi
went
with
the
party
to
the
search
with
an
easy
mind
for
i
think
i
never
saw
mina
so
absolutely
strong
and
well
i
am
so
glad
that
she
consented
to
hold
back
and
let
us
men
do
the
work
somehow
it
was
a
dread
to
me
that
she
was
in
this
fearful
business
at
all
but
now
that
her
work
is
done
and
that
it
is
due
to
her
energy
and
brains
and
foresight
that
the
whole
story
is
put
together
in
such
a
way
that
every
point
tells
she
may
well
feel
that
her
part
is
finished
and
that
she
can
henceforth
leave
the
rest
to
us
we
were
i
think
all
a
little
upset
by
the
scene
with
mr
renfield
when
we
came
away
from
his
room
we
were
silent
till
we
got
back
to
the
study
then
mr
morris
said
to
dr
seward
say
jack
if
that
man
wasnt
attempting
a
bluff
he
is
about
the
sanest
lunatic
i
ever
saw
im
not
sure
but
i
believe
that
he
had
some
serious
purpose
and
if
he
had
it
was
pretty
rough
on
him
not
to
get
a
chance
lord
godalming
and
i
were
silent
but
dr
van
helsing
added
friend
john
you
know
more
of
lunatics
than
i
do
and
im
glad
of
it
for
i
fear
that
if
it
had
been
to
me
to
decide
i
would
before
that
last
hysterical
outburst
have
given
him
free
but
we
live
and
learn
and
in
our
present
task
we
must
take
no
chance
as
my
friend
quincey
would
say
all
is
best
as
they
are
dr
seward
seemed
to
answer
them
both
in
a
dreamy
kind
of
way
i
dont
know
but
that
i
agree
with
you
if
that
man
had
been
an
ordinary
lunatic
i
would
have
taken
my
chance
of
trusting
him
but
he
seems
so
mixed
up
with
the
count
in
an
indexy
kind
of
way
that
i
am
afraid
of
doing
anything
wrong
by
helping
his
fads
i
cant
forget
how
he
prayed
with
almost
equal
fervour
for
a
cat
and
then
tried
to
tear
my
throat
out
with
his
teeth
besides
he
called
the
count
lord
and
master
and
he
may
want
to
get
out
to
help
him
in
some
diabolical
way
that
horrid
thing
has
the
wolves
and
the
rats
and
his
own
kind
to
help
him
so
i
suppose
he
isnt
above
trying
to
use
a
respectable
lunatic
he
certainly
did
seem
earnest
though
i
only
hope
we
have
done
what
is
best
these
things
in
conjunction
with
the
wild
work
we
have
in
hand
help
to
unnerve
a
man
the
professor
stepped
over
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
said
in
his
grave
kindly
way
friend
john
have
no
fear
we
are
trying
to
do
our
duty
in
a
very
sad
and
terrible
case
we
can
only
do
as
we
deem
best
what
else
have
we
to
hope
for
except
the
pity
of
the
good
god
lord
godalming
had
slipped
away
for
a
few
minutes
but
now
he
returned
he
held
up
a
little
silver
whistle
as
he
remarked
that
old
place
may
be
full
of
rats
and
if
so
ive
got
an
antidote
on
call
having
passed
the
wall
we
took
our
way
to
the
house
taking
care
to
keep
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
on
the
lawn
when
the
moonlight
shone
out
when
we
got
to
the
porch
the
professor
opened
his
bag
and
took
out
a
lot
of
things
which
he
laid
on
the
step
sorting
them
into
four
little
groups
evidently
one
for
each
then
he
spoke
my
friends
we
are
going
into
a
terrible
danger
and
we
need
arms
of
many
kinds
our
enemy
is
not
merely
spiritual
remember
that
he
has
the
strength
of
twenty
men
and
that
though
our
necks
or
our
windpipes
are
of
the
common
kindand
therefore
breakable
or
crushablehis
are
not
amenable
to
mere
strength
a
stronger
man
or
a
body
of
men
more
strong
in
all
than
him
can
at
certain
times
hold
him
but
they
cannot
hurt
him
as
we
can
be
hurt
by
him
we
must
therefore
guard
ourselves
from
his
touch
keep
this
near
your
heartas
he
spoke
he
lifted
a
little
silver
crucifix
and
held
it
out
to
me
i
being
nearest
to
himput
these
flowers
round
your
neckhere
he
handed
to
me
a
wreath
of
withered
garlic
blossomsfor
other
enemies
more
mundane
this
revolver
and
this
knife
and
for
aid
in
all
these
so
small
electric
lamps
which
you
can
fasten
to
your
breast
and
for
all
and
above
all
at
the
last
this
which
we
must
not
desecrate
needless
this
was
a
portion
of
sacred
wafer
which
he
put
in
an
envelope
and
handed
to
me
each
of
the
others
was
similarly
equipped
now
he
said
friend
john
where
are
the
skeleton
keys
if
so
that
we
can
open
the
door
we
need
not
break
house
by
the
window
as
before
at
miss
lucys
dr
seward
tried
one
or
two
skeleton
keys
his
mechanical
dexterity
as
a
surgeon
standing
him
in
good
stead
presently
he
got
one
to
suit
after
a
little
play
back
and
forward
the
bolt
yielded
and
with
a
rusty
clang
shot
back
we
pressed
on
the
door
the
rusty
hinges
creaked
and
it
slowly
opened
it
was
startlingly
like
the
image
conveyed
to
me
in
dr
sewards
diary
of
the
opening
of
miss
westenras
tomb
i
fancy
that
the
same
idea
seemed
to
strike
the
others
for
with
one
accord
they
shrank
back
the
professor
was
the
first
to
move
forward
and
stepped
into
the
open
door
in
manus
tuas
domine
he
said
crossing
himself
as
he
passed
over
the
threshold
we
closed
the
door
behind
us
lest
when
we
should
have
lit
our
lamps
we
should
possibly
attract
attention
from
the
road
the
professor
carefully
tried
the
lock
lest
we
might
not
be
able
to
open
it
from
within
should
we
be
in
a
hurry
making
our
exit
then
we
all
lit
our
lamps
and
proceeded
on
our
search
the
light
from
the
tiny
lamps
fell
in
all
sorts
of
odd
forms
as
the
rays
crossed
each
other
or
the
opacity
of
our
bodies
threw
great
shadows
i
could
not
for
my
life
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
there
was
some
one
else
amongst
us
i
suppose
it
was
the
recollection
so
powerfully
brought
home
to
me
by
the
grim
surroundings
of
that
terrible
experience
in
transylvania
i
think
the
feeling
was
common
to
us
all
for
i
noticed
that
the
others
kept
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
every
sound
and
every
new
shadow
just
as
i
felt
myself
doing
the
whole
place
was
thick
with
dust
the
floor
was
seemingly
inches
deep
except
where
there
were
recent
footsteps
in
which
on
holding
down
my
lamp
i
could
see
marks
of
hobnails
where
the
dust
was
cracked
the
walls
were
fluffy
and
heavy
with
dust
and
in
the
corners
were
masses
of
spiders
webs
whereon
the
dust
had
gathered
till
they
looked
like
old
tattered
rags
as
the
weight
had
torn
them
partly
down
on
a
table
in
the
hall
was
a
great
bunch
of
keys
with
a
timeyellowed
label
on
each
they
had
been
used
several
times
for
on
the
table
were
several
similar
rents
in
the
blanket
of
dust
similar
to
that
exposed
when
the
professor
lifted
them
he
turned
to
me
and
said
you
know
this
place
jonathan
you
have
copied
maps
of
it
and
you
know
it
at
least
more
than
we
do
which
is
the
way
to
the
chapel
i
had
an
idea
of
its
direction
though
on
my
former
visit
i
had
not
been
able
to
get
admission
to
it
so
i
led
the
way
and
after
a
few
wrong
turnings
found
myself
opposite
a
low
arched
oaken
door
ribbed
with
iron
bands
this
is
the
spot
said
the
professor
as
he
turned
his
lamp
on
a
small
map
of
the
house
copied
from
the
file
of
my
original
correspondence
regarding
the
purchase
with
a
little
trouble
we
found
the
key
on
the
bunch
and
opened
the
door
we
were
prepared
for
some
unpleasantness
for
as
we
were
opening
the
door
a
faint
malodorous
air
seemed
to
exhale
through
the
gaps
but
none
of
us
ever
expected
such
an
odour
as
we
encountered
none
of
the
others
had
met
the
count
at
all
at
close
quarters
and
when
i
had
seen
him
he
was
either
in
the
fasting
stage
of
his
existence
in
his
rooms
or
when
he
was
gloated
with
fresh
blood
in
a
ruined
building
open
to
the
air
but
here
the
place
was
small
and
close
and
the
long
disuse
had
made
the
air
stagnant
and
foul
there
was
an
earthy
smell
as
of
some
dry
miasma
which
came
through
the
fouler
air
but
as
to
the
odour
itself
how
shall
i
describe
it
it
was
not
alone
that
it
was
composed
of
all
the
ills
of
mortality
and
with
the
pungent
acrid
smell
of
blood
but
it
seemed
as
though
corruption
had
become
itself
corrupt
faugh
it
sickens
me
to
think
of
it
every
breath
exhaled
by
that
monster
seemed
to
have
clung
to
the
place
and
intensified
its
loathsomeness
under
ordinary
circumstances
such
a
stench
would
have
brought
our
enterprise
to
an
end
but
this
was
no
ordinary
case
and
the
high
and
terrible
purpose
in
which
we
were
involved
gave
us
a
strength
which
rose
above
merely
physical
considerations
after
the
involuntary
shrinking
consequent
on
the
first
nauseous
whiff
we
one
and
all
set
about
our
work
as
though
that
loathsome
place
were
a
garden
of
roses
we
made
an
accurate
examination
of
the
place
the
professor
saying
as
we
began
the
first
thing
is
to
see
how
many
of
the
boxes
are
left
we
must
then
examine
every
hole
and
corner
and
cranny
and
see
if
we
cannot
get
some
clue
as
to
what
has
become
of
the
rest
a
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
how
many
remained
for
the
great
earth
chests
were
bulky
and
there
was
no
mistaking
them
there
were
only
twentynine
left
out
of
the
fifty
once
i
got
a
fright
for
seeing
lord
godalming
suddenly
turn
and
look
out
of
the
vaulted
door
into
the
dark
passage
beyond
i
looked
too
and
for
an
instant
my
heart
stood
still
somewhere
looking
out
from
the
shadow
i
seemed
to
see
the
high
lights
of
the
counts
evil
face
the
ridge
of
the
nose
the
red
eyes
the
red
lips
the
awful
pallor
it
was
only
for
a
moment
for
as
lord
godalming
said
i
thought
i
saw
a
face
but
it
was
only
the
shadows
and
resumed
his
inquiry
i
turned
my
lamp
in
the
direction
and
stepped
into
the
passage
there
was
no
sign
of
any
one
and
as
there
were
no
corners
no
doors
no
aperture
of
any
kind
but
only
the
solid
walls
of
the
passage
there
could
be
no
hidingplace
even
for
him
i
took
it
that
fear
had
helped
imagination
and
said
nothing
a
few
minutes
later
i
saw
morris
step
suddenly
back
from
a
corner
which
he
was
examining
we
all
followed
his
movements
with
our
eyes
for
undoubtedly
some
nervousness
was
growing
on
us
and
we
saw
a
whole
mass
of
phosphorescence
which
twinkled
like
stars
we
all
instinctively
drew
back
the
whole
place
was
becoming
alive
with
rats
for
a
moment
or
two
we
stood
appalled
all
save
lord
godalming
who
was
seemingly
prepared
for
such
an
emergency
rushing
over
to
the
great
ironbound
oaken
door
which
dr
seward
had
described
from
the
outside
and
which
i
had
seen
myself
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
drew
the
huge
bolts
and
swung
the
door
open
then
taking
his
little
silver
whistle
from
his
pocket
he
blew
a
low
shrill
call
it
was
answered
from
behind
dr
sewards
house
by
the
yelping
of
dogs
and
after
about
a
minute
three
terriers
came
dashing
round
the
corner
of
the
house
unconsciously
we
had
all
moved
towards
the
door
and
as
we
moved
i
noticed
that
the
dust
had
been
much
disturbed
the
boxes
which
had
been
taken
out
had
been
brought
this
way
but
even
in
the
minute
that
had
elapsed
the
number
of
the
rats
had
vastly
increased
they
seemed
to
swarm
over
the
place
all
at
once
till
the
lamplight
shining
on
their
moving
dark
bodies
and
glittering
baleful
eyes
made
the
place
look
like
a
bank
of
earth
set
with
fireflies
the
dogs
dashed
on
but
at
the
threshold
suddenly
stopped
and
snarled
and
then
simultaneously
lifting
their
noses
began
to
howl
in
most
lugubrious
fashion
the
rats
were
multiplying
in
thousands
and
we
moved
out
lord
godalming
lifted
one
of
the
dogs
and
carrying
him
in
placed
him
on
the
floor
the
instant
his
feet
touched
the
ground
he
seemed
to
recover
his
courage
and
rushed
at
his
natural
enemies
they
fled
before
him
so
fast
that
before
he
had
shaken
the
life
out
of
a
score
the
other
dogs
who
had
by
now
been
lifted
in
the
same
manner
had
but
small
prey
ere
the
whole
mass
had
vanished
with
their
going
it
seemed
as
if
some
evil
presence
had
departed
for
the
dogs
frisked
about
and
barked
merrily
as
they
made
sudden
darts
at
their
prostrate
foes
and
turned
them
over
and
over
and
tossed
them
in
the
air
with
vicious
shakes
we
all
seemed
to
find
our
spirits
rise
whether
it
was
the
purifying
of
the
deadly
atmosphere
by
the
opening
of
the
chapel
door
or
the
relief
which
we
experienced
by
finding
ourselves
in
the
open
i
know
not
but
most
certainly
the
shadow
of
dread
seemed
to
slip
from
us
like
a
robe
and
the
occasion
of
our
coming
lost
something
of
its
grim
significance
though
we
did
not
slacken
a
whit
in
our
resolution
we
closed
the
outer
door
and
barred
and
locked
it
and
bringing
the
dogs
with
us
began
our
search
of
the
house
we
found
nothing
throughout
except
dust
in
extraordinary
proportions
and
all
untouched
save
for
my
own
footsteps
when
i
had
made
my
first
visit
never
once
did
the
dogs
exhibit
any
symptom
of
uneasiness
and
even
when
we
returned
to
the
chapel
they
frisked
about
as
though
they
had
been
rabbithunting
in
a
summer
wood
the
morning
was
quickening
in
the
east
when
we
emerged
from
the
front
dr
van
helsing
had
taken
the
key
of
the
halldoor
from
the
bunch
and
locked
the
door
in
orthodox
fashion
putting
the
key
into
his
pocket
when
he
had
done
so
far
he
said
our
night
has
been
eminently
successful
no
harm
has
come
to
us
such
as
i
feared
might
be
and
yet
we
have
ascertained
how
many
boxes
are
missing
more
than
all
do
i
rejoice
that
this
our
firstand
perhaps
our
most
difficult
and
dangerousstep
has
been
accomplished
without
the
bringing
thereinto
our
most
sweet
madam
mina
or
troubling
her
waking
or
sleeping
thoughts
with
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
of
horror
which
she
might
never
forget
one
lesson
too
we
have
learned
if
it
be
allowable
to
argue
a
particulari
that
the
brute
beasts
which
are
to
the
counts
command
are
yet
themselves
not
amenable
to
his
spiritual
power
for
look
these
rats
that
would
come
to
his
call
just
as
from
his
castle
top
he
summon
the
wolves
to
your
going
and
to
that
poor
mothers
cry
though
they
come
to
him
they
run
pellmell
from
the
so
little
dogs
of
my
friend
arthur
we
have
other
matters
before
us
other
dangers
other
fears
and
that
monsterhe
has
not
used
his
power
over
the
brute
world
for
the
only
or
the
last
time
tonight
so
be
it
that
he
has
gone
elsewhere
good
it
has
given
us
opportunity
to
cry
check
in
some
ways
in
this
chess
game
which
we
play
for
the
stake
of
human
souls
and
now
let
us
go
home
the
dawn
is
close
at
hand
and
we
have
reason
to
be
content
with
our
first
nights
work
it
may
be
ordained
that
we
have
many
nights
and
days
to
follow
if
full
of
peril
but
we
must
go
on
and
from
no
danger
shall
we
shrink
the
house
was
silent
when
we
got
back
save
for
some
poor
creature
who
was
screaming
away
in
one
of
the
distant
wards
and
a
low
moaning
sound
from
renfields
room
the
poor
wretch
was
doubtless
torturing
himself
after
the
manner
of
the
insane
with
needless
thoughts
of
pain
i
came
tiptoe
into
our
own
room
and
found
mina
asleep
breathing
so
softly
that
i
had
to
put
my
ear
down
to
hear
it
she
looks
paler
than
usual
i
hope
the
meeting
tonight
has
not
upset
her
i
am
truly
thankful
that
she
is
to
be
left
out
of
our
future
work
and
even
of
our
deliberations
it
is
too
great
a
strain
for
a
woman
to
bear
i
did
not
think
so
at
first
but
i
know
better
now
therefore
i
am
glad
that
it
is
settled
there
may
be
things
which
would
frighten
her
to
hear
and
yet
to
conceal
them
from
her
might
be
worse
than
to
tell
her
if
once
she
suspected
that
there
was
any
concealment
henceforth
our
work
is
to
be
a
sealed
book
to
her
till
at
least
such
time
as
we
can
tell
her
that
all
is
finished
and
the
earth
free
from
a
monster
of
the
nether
world
i
daresay
it
will
be
difficult
to
begin
to
keep
silence
after
such
confidence
as
ours
but
i
must
be
resolute
and
tomorrow
i
shall
keep
dark
over
tonights
doings
and
shall
refuse
to
speak
of
anything
that
has
happened
i
rest
on
the
sofa
so
as
not
to
disturb
her





1
october
lateri
suppose
it
was
natural
that
we
should
have
all
overslept
ourselves
for
the
day
was
a
busy
one
and
the
night
had
no
rest
at
all
even
mina
must
have
felt
its
exhaustion
for
though
i
slept
till
the
sun
was
high
i
was
awake
before
her
and
had
to
call
two
or
three
times
before
she
awoke
indeed
she
was
so
sound
asleep
that
for
a
few
seconds
she
did
not
recognize
me
but
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
blank
terror
as
one
looks
who
has
been
waked
out
of
a
bad
dream
she
complained
a
little
of
being
tired
and
i
let
her
rest
till
later
in
the
day
we
now
know
of
twentyone
boxes
having
been
removed
and
if
it
be
that
several
were
taken
in
any
of
these
removals
we
may
be
able
to
trace
them
all
such
will
of
course
immensely
simplify
our
labour
and
the
sooner
the
matter
is
attended
to
the
better

shall
look

diary
1
octoberit
was
towards
noon
when
i
was
awakened
by
the
professor
walking
into
my
room
he
was
more
jolly
and
cheerful
than
usual
and
it
is
quite
evident
that
last
nights
work
has
helped
to
take
some
of
the
brooding
weight
off
his
mind
after
going
over
the
adventure
of
the
night
he
suddenly
said
your
patient
interests
me
much
may
it
be
that
with
you
i
visit
him
this
morning
or
if
that
you
are
too
occupy
i
can
go
alone
if
it
may
be
it
is
a
new
experience
to
me
to
find
a
lunatic
who
talk
philosophy
and
reason
so
sound
i
had
some
work
to
do
which
pressed
so
i
told
him
that
if
he
would
go
alone
i
would
be
glad
as
then
i
should
not
have
to
keep
him
waiting
so
i
called
an
attendant
and
gave
him
the
necessary
instructions
before
the
professor
left
the
room
i
cautioned
him
against
getting
any
false
impression
from
my
patient
but
he
answered
i
want
him
to
talk
of
himself
and
of
his
delusion
as
to
consuming
live
things
he
said
to
madam
mina
as
i
see
in
your
diary
of
yesterday
that
he
had
once
had
such
a
belief
why
do
you
smile
friend
john
excuse
me
i
said
but
the
answer
is
here
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
typewritten
matter
when
our
sane
and
learned
lunatic
made
that
very
statement
of
how
he
used
to
consume
life
his
mouth
was
actually
nauseous
with
the
flies
and
spiders
which
he
had
eaten
just
before
mrs
harker
entered
the
room
van
helsing
smiled
in
turn
good
he
said
your
memory
is
true
friend
john
i
should
have
remembered
and
yet
it
is
this
very
obliquity
of
thought
and
memory
which
makes
mental
disease
such
a
fascinating
study
perhaps
i
may
gain
more
knowledge
out
of
the
folly
of
this
madman
than
i
shall
from
the
teaching
of
the
most
wise
who
knows
i
went
on
with
my
work
and
before
long
was
through
that
in
hand
it
seemed
that
the
time
had
been
very
short
indeed
but
there
was
van
helsing
back
in
the
study
do
i
interrupt
he
asked
politely
as
he
stood
at
the
door
not
at
all
i
answered
come
in
my
work
is
finished
and
i
am
free
i
can
go
with
you
now
if
you
like
it
is
needless
i
have
seen
him
well
i
fear
that
he
does
not
appraise
me
at
much
our
interview
was
short
when
i
entered
his
room
he
was
sitting
on
a
stool
in
the
centre
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
face
was
the
picture
of
sullen
discontent
i
spoke
to
him
as
cheerfully
as
i
could
and
with
such
a
measure
of
respect
as
i
could
assume
he
made
no
reply
whatever
dont
you
know
me
i
asked
his
answer
was
not
reassuring
i
know
you
well
enough
you
are
the
old
fool
van
helsing
i
wish
you
would
take
yourself
and
your
idiotic
brain
theories
somewhere
else
damn
all
thickheaded
dutchmen
not
a
word
more
would
he
say
but
sat
in
his
implacable
sullenness
as
indifferent
to
me
as
though
i
had
not
been
in
the
room
at
all
thus
departed
for
this
time
my
chance
of
much
learning
from
this
so
clever
lunatic
so
i
shall
go
if
i
may
and
cheer
myself
with
a
few
happy
words
with
that
sweet
soul
madam
mina
friend
john
it
does
rejoice
me
unspeakable
that
she
is
no
more
to
be
pained
no
more
to
be
worried
with
our
terrible
things
though
we
shall
much
miss
her
help
it
is
better
so
i
agree
with
you
with
all
my
heart
i
answered
earnestly
for
i
did
not
want
him
to
weaken
in
this
matter
mrs
harker
is
better
out
of
it
things
are
quite
bad
enough
for
us
all
men
of
the
world
and
who
have
been
in
many
tight
places
in
our
time
but
it
is
no
place
for
a
woman
and
if
she
had
remained
in
touch
with
the
affair
it
would
in
time
infallibly
have
wrecked
her
so
van
helsing
has
gone
to
confer
with
mrs
harker
and
harker
quincey
and
art
are
all
out
following
up
the
clues
as
to
the
earthboxes
i
shall
finish
my
round
of
work
and
we
shall
meet
tonight
mina
harkers
journal
1
octoberit
is
strange
to
me
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
as
i
am
today
after
jonathans
full
confidence
for
so
many
years
to
see
him
manifestly
avoid
certain
matters
and
those
the
most
vital
of
all
this
morning
i
slept
late
after
the
fatigues
of
yesterday
and
though
jonathan
was
late
too
he
was
the
earlier
he
spoke
to
me
before
he
went
out
never
more
sweetly
or
tenderly
but
he
never
mentioned
a
word
of
what
had
happened
in
the
visit
to
the
counts
house
and
yet
he
must
have
known
how
terribly
anxious
i
was
poor
dear
fellow
i
suppose
it
must
have
distressed
him
even
more
than
it
did
me
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
best
that
i
should
not
be
drawn
further
into
this
awful
work
and
i
acquiesced
but
to
think
that
he
keeps
anything
from
me
and
now
i
am
crying
like
a
silly
fool
when
i
know
it
comes
from
my
husbands
great
love
and
from
the
good
good
wishes
of
those
other
strong
men
that
has
done
me
good
well
some
day
jonathan
will
tell
me
all
and
lest
it
should
ever
be
that
he
should
think
for
a
moment
that
i
kept
anything
from
him
i
still
keep
my
journal
as
usual
then
if
he
has
feared
of
my
trust
i
shall
show
it
to
him
with
every
thought
of
my
heart
put
down
for
his
dear
eyes
to
read
i
feel
strangely
sad
and
lowspirited
today
i
suppose
it
is
the
reaction
from
the
terrible
excitement
last
night
i
went
to
bed
when
the
men
had
gone
simply
because
they
told
me
to
i
didnt
feel
sleepy
and
i
did
feel
full
of
devouring
anxiety
i
kept
thinking
over
everything
that
has
been
ever
since
jonathan
came
to
see
me
in
london
and
it
all
seems
like
a
horrible
tragedy
with
fate
pressing
on
relentlessly
to
some
destined
end
everything
that
one
does
seems
no
matter
how
right
it
may
be
to
bring
on
the
very
thing
which
is
most
to
be
deplored
if
i
hadnt
gone
to
whitby
perhaps
poor
dear
lucy
would
be
with
us
now
she
hadnt
taken
to
visiting
the
churchyard
till
i
came
and
if
she
hadnt
come
there
in
the
daytime
with
me
she
wouldnt
have
walked
there
in
her
sleep
and
if
she
hadnt
gone
there
at
night
and
asleep
that
monster
couldnt
have
destroyed
her
as
he
did
oh
why
did
i
ever
go
to
whitby
there
now
crying
again
i
wonder
what
has
come
over
me
today
i
must
hide
it
from
jonathan
for
if
he
knew
that
i
had
been
crying
twice
in
one
morningi
who
never
cried
on
my
own
account
and
whom
he
has
never
caused
to
shed
a
tearthe
dear
fellow
would
fret
his
heart
out
i
shall
put
a
bold
face
on
and
if
i
do
feel
weepy
he
shall
never
see
it
i
suppose
it
is
one
of
the
lessons
that
we
poor
women
have
to
learn
i
cant
quite
remember
how
i
fell
asleep
last
night
i
remember
hearing
the
sudden
barking
of
the
dogs
and
a
lot
of
queer
sounds
like
praying
on
a
very
tumultuous
scale
from
mr
renfields
room
which
is
somewhere
under
this
and
then
there
was
silence
over
everything
silence
so
profound
that
it
startled
me
and
i
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
all
was
dark
and
silent
the
black
shadows
thrown
by
the
moonlight
seeming
full
of
a
silent
mystery
of
their
own
not
a
thing
seemed
to
be
stirring
but
all
to
be
grim
and
fixed
as
death
or
fate
so
that
a
thin
streak
of
white
mist
that
crept
with
almost
imperceptible
slowness
across
the
grass
towards
the
house
seemed
to
have
a
sentience
and
a
vitality
of
its
own
i
think
that
the
digression
of
my
thoughts
must
have
done
me
good
for
when
i
got
back
to
bed
i
found
a
lethargy
creeping
over
me
i
lay
a
while
but
could
not
quite
sleep
so
i
got
out
and
looked
out
of
the
window
again
the
mist
was
spreading
and
was
now
close
up
to
the
house
so
that
i
could
see
it
lying
thick
against
the
wall
as
though
it
were
stealing
up
to
the
windows
the
poor
man
was
more
loud
than
ever
and
though
i
could
not
distinguish
a
word
he
said
i
could
in
some
way
recognise
in
his
tones
some
passionate
entreaty
on
his
part
then
there
was
the
sound
of
a
struggle
and
i
knew
that
the
attendants
were
dealing
with
him
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
crept
into
bed
and
pulled
the
clothes
over
my
head
putting
my
fingers
in
my
ears
i
was
not
then
a
bit
sleepy
at
least
so
i
thought
but
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
except
dreams
i
do
not
remember
anything
until
the
morning
when
jonathan
woke
me
i
think
that
it
took
me
an
effort
and
a
little
time
to
realise
where
i
was
and
that
it
was
jonathan
who
was
bending
over
me
my
dream
was
very
peculiar
and
was
almost
typical
of
the
way
that
waking
thoughts
become
merged
in
or
continued
in
dreams
i
thought
that
i
was
asleep
and
waiting
for
jonathan
to
come
back
i
was
very
anxious
about
him
and
i
was
powerless
to
act
my
feet
and
my
hands
and
my
brain
were
weighted
so
that
nothing
could
proceed
at
the
usual
pace
and
so
i
slept
uneasily
and
thought
then
it
began
to
dawn
upon
me
that
the
air
was
heavy
and
dank
and
cold
i
put
back
the
clothes
from
my
face
and
found
to
my
surprise
that
all
was
dim
around
the
gaslight
which
i
had
left
lit
for
jonathan
but
turned
down
came
only
like
a
tiny
red
spark
through
the
fog
which
had
evidently
grown
thicker
and
poured
into
the
room
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
shut
the
window
before
i
had
come
to
bed
i
would
have
got
out
to
make
certain
on
the
point
but
some
leaden
lethargy
seemed
to
chain
my
limbs
and
even
my
will
i
lay
still
and
endured
that
was
all
i
closed
my
eyes
but
could
still
see
through
my
eyelids
it
is
wonderful
what
tricks
our
dreams
play
us
and
how
conveniently
we
can
imagine
the
mist
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
i
could
see
now
how
it
came
in
for
i
could
see
it
like
smokeor
with
the
white
energy
of
boiling
waterpouring
in
not
through
the
window
but
through
the
joinings
of
the
door
it
got
thicker
and
thicker
till
it
seemed
as
if
it
became
concentrated
into
a
sort
of
pillar
of
cloud
in
the
room
through
the
top
of
which
i
could
see
the
light
of
the
gas
shining
like
a
red
eye
things
began
to
whirl
through
my
brain
just
as
the
cloudy
column
was
now
whirling
in
the
room
and
through
it
all
came
the
scriptural
words
a
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
of
fire
by
night
was
it
indeed
some
such
spiritual
guidance
that
was
coming
to
me
in
my
sleep
but
the
pillar
was
composed
of
both
the
day
and
the
nightguiding
for
the
fire
was
in
the
red
eye
which
at
the
thought
got
a
new
fascination
for
me
till
as
i
looked
the
fire
divided
and
seemed
to
shine
on
me
through
the
fog
like
two
red
eyes
such
as
lucy
told
me
of
in
her
momentary
mental
wandering
when
on
the
cliff
the
dying
sunlight
struck
the
windows
of
st
marys
church
suddenly
the
horror
burst
upon
me
that
it
was
thus
that
jonathan
had
seen
those
awful
women
growing
into
reality
through
the
whirling
mist
in
the
moonlight
and
in
my
dream
i
must
have
fainted
for
all
became
black
darkness
the
last
conscious
effort
which
imagination
made
was
to
show
me
a
livid
white
face
bending
over
me
out
of
the
mist
i
must
be
careful
of
such
dreams
for
they
would
unseat
ones
reason
if
there
were
too
much
of
them
i
would
get
dr
van
helsing
or
dr
seward
to
prescribe
something
for
me
which
would
make
me
sleep
only
that
i
fear
to
alarm
them
such
a
dream
at
the
present
time
would
become
woven
into
their
fears
for
me
tonight
i
shall
strive
hard
to
sleep
naturally
if
i
do
not
i
shall
tomorrow
night
get
them
to
give
me
a
dose
of
chloral
that
cannot
hurt
me
for
once
and
it
will
give
me
a
good
nights
sleep
last
night
tired
me
more
than
if
i
had
not
slept
at
all

p
mlast
night
i
slept
but
did
not
dream
i
must
have
slept
soundly
for
i
was
not
waked
by
jonathan
coming
to
bed
but
the
sleep
has
not
refreshed
me
for
today
i
feel
terribly
weak
and
spiritless
i
spent
all
yesterday
trying
to
read
or
lying
down
dozing
in
the
afternoon
mr
renfield
asked
if
he
might
see
me
poor
man
he
was
very
gentle
and
when
i
came
away
he
kissed
my
hand
and
bade
god
bless
me
some
way
it
affected
me
much
i
am
crying
when
i
think
of
him
this
is
a
new
weakness
of
which
i
must
be
careful
jonathan
would
be
miserable
if
he
knew
i
had
been
crying
he
and
the
others
were
out
till
dinnertime
and
they
all
came
in
tired
i
did
what
i
could
to
brighten
them
up
and
i
suppose
that
the
effort
did
me
good
for
i
forgot
how
tired
i
was
after
dinner
they
sent
me
to
bed
and
all
went
off
to
smoke
together
as
they
said
but
i
knew
that
they
wanted
to
tell
each
other
of
what
had
occurred
to
each
during
the
day
i
could
see
from
jonathans
manner
that
he
had
something
important
to
communicate
i
was
not
so
sleepy
as
i
should
have
been
so
before
they
went
i
asked
dr
seward
to
give
me
a
little
opiate
of
some
kind
as
i
had
not
slept
well
the
night
before
he
very
kindly
made
me
up
a
sleeping
draught
which
he
gave
to
me
telling
me
that
it
would
do
me
no
harm
as
it
was
very
mild
i
have
taken
it
and
am
waiting
for
sleep
which
still
keeps
aloof
i
hope
i
have
not
done
wrong
for
as
sleep
begins
to
flirt
with
me
a
new
fear
comes
that
i
may
have
been
foolish
in
thus
depriving
myself
of
the
power
of
waking
i
might
want
it
here
comes

1
october
eveningi
found
thomas
snelling
in
his
house
at
bethnal
green
but
unhappily
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
remember
anything
the
very
prospect
of
beer
which
my
expected
coming
had
opened
to
him
had
proved
too
much
and
he
had
begun
too
early
on
his
expected
debauch
i
learned
however
from
his
wife
who
seemed
a
decent
poor
soul
that
he
was
only
the
assistant
to
smollet
who
of
the
two
mates
was
the
responsible
person
so
off
i
drove
to
walworth
and
found
mr
joseph
smollet
at
home
and
in
his
shirtsleeves
taking
a
late
tea
out
of
a
saucer
he
is
a
decent
intelligent
fellow
distinctly
a
good
reliable
type
of
workman
and
with
a
headpiece
of
his
own
he
remembered
all
about
the
incident
of
the
boxes
and
from
a
wonderful
dogseared
notebook
which
he
produced
from
some
mysterious
receptacle
about
the
seat
of
his
trousers
and
which
had
hieroglyphical
entries
in
thick
halfobliterated
pencil
he
gave
me
the
destinations
of
the
boxes
there
were
he
said
six
in
the
cartload
which
he
took
from
carfax
and
left
at
197
chicksand
street
mile
end
new
town
and
another
six
which
he
deposited
at
jamaica
lane
bermondsey
if
then
the
count
meant
to
scatter
these
ghastly
refuges
of
his
over
london
these
places
were
chosen
as
the
first
of
delivery
so
that
later
he
might
distribute
more
fully
the
systematic
manner
in
which
this
was
done
made
me
think
that
he
could
not
mean
to
confine
himself
to
two
sides
of
london
he
was
now
fixed
on
the
far
east
of
the
northern
shore
on
the
east
of
the
southern
shore
and
on
the
south
the
north
and
west
were
surely
never
meant
to
be
left
out
of
his
diabolical
schemelet
alone
the
city
itself
and
the
very
heart
of
fashionable
london
in
the
southwest
and
west
i
went
back
to
smollet
and
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
us
if
any
other
boxes
had
been
taken
from
carfax
he
replied
well
guvnor
youve
treated
me
wery
ansomei
had
given
him
half
a
sovereignan
ill

i
asked
if
he
could
tell
me
where
to
find
him
i
told
him
that
if
he
could
get
me
the
address
it
would
be
worth
another
halfsovereign
to
him
so
he
gulped
down
the
rest
of
his
tea
and
stood
up
saying
that
he
was
going
to
begin
the
search
then
and
there
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
said
look
ere
guvnor
there
aint
no
sense
in
me
akeepin
you
ere
i

to
be
in
a
way
to
tell
ye
much
tonight
sam
is
a
rare
one
when
he
starts
on
the
booze
if
you

give
me
a
envelope
with
a
stamp
on

wont
ketch
im
for
sam
gets
off
main
early
never
mind
the
booze
the
night
afore
this
was
all
practical
so
one
of
the
children
went
off
with
a
penny
to
buy
an
envelope
and
a
sheet
of
paper
and
to
keep
the
change
when
she
came
back
i
addressed
the
envelope
and
stamped
it
and
when
smollet
had
again
faithfully
promised
to
post
the
address
when
found
i
took
my
way
to
home
were
on
the
track
anyhow
i
am
tired
tonight
and
want
sleep
mina
is
fast
asleep
and
looks
a
little
too
pale
her
eyes
look
as
though
she
had
been
crying
poor
dear
ive
no
doubt
it
frets
her
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
and
it
may
make
her
doubly
anxious
about
me
and
the
others
but
it
is
best
as
it
is
it
is
better
to
be
disappointed
and
worried
in
such
a
way
now
than
to
have
her
nerve
broken
the
doctors
were
quite
right
to
insist
on
her
being
kept
out
of
this
dreadful
business
i
must
be
firm
for
on
me
this
particular
burden
of
silence
must
rest
i
shall
not
ever
enter
on
the
subject
with
her
under
any
circumstances
indeed
it
may
not
be
a
hard
task
after
all
for
she
herself
has
become
reticent
on
the
subject
and
has
not
spoken
of
the
count
or
his
doings
ever
since
we
told
her
of
our
decision





2
october
eveninga
long
and
trying
and
exciting
day
by
the
first
post
i
got
my
directed
envelope
with
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
enclosed
on
which
was
written
with
a
carpenters
pencil
in
a
sprawling
hand
sam
bloxam
korkrans
4
poters
cort
bartel
street
walworth
arsk
for
the
depite
i
got
the
letter
in
bed
and
rose
without
waking
mina
she
looked
heavy
and
sleepy
and
pale
and
far
from
well
i
determined
not
to
wake
her
but
that
when
i
should
return
from
this
new
search
i
would
arrange
for
her
going
back
to
exeter
i
think
she
would
be
happier
in
our
own
home
with
her
daily
tasks
to
interest
her
than
in
being
here
amongst
us
and
in
ignorance
i
only
saw
dr
seward
for
a
moment
and
told
him
where
i
was
off
to
promising
to
come
back
and
tell
the
rest
so
soon
as
i
should
have
found
out
anything
i
drove
to
walworth
and
found
with
some
difficulty
potters
court
mr
smollets
spelling
misled
me
as
i
asked
for
poters
court
instead
of
potters
court
however
when
i
had
found
the
court
i
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
corcorans
lodginghouse
when
i
asked
the
man
who
came
to
the
door
for
the
depite
he
shook
his
head
and
said
i
dunno
im
there
aint
no
such
a
person
ere
i
never
eard
of
im
in
all
my
bloomin
days
dont
believe
there
aint
nobody
of
that
kind
livin
ere
or
anywheres
i
took
out
smollets
letter
and
as
i
read
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
lesson
of
the
spelling
of
the
name
of
the
court
might
guide
me
what
are
you
i
asked
im
the
depity
he
answered
i
saw
at
once
that
i
was
on
the
right
track
phonetic
spelling
had
again
misled
me
a
halfcrown
tip
put
the
deputys
knowledge
at
my
disposal
and
i
learned
that
mr
bloxam
who
had
slept
off
the
remains
of
his
beer
on
the
previous
night
at
corcorans
had
left
for
his
work
at
poplar
at
five
oclock
that
morning
he
could
not
tell
me
where
the
place
of
work
was
situated
but
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
it
was
some
kind
of
a
newfangled
wareus
and
with
this
slender
clue
i
had
to
start
for
poplar
it
was
twelve
oclock
before
i
got
any
satisfactory
hint
of
such
a
building
and
this
i
got
at
a
coffeeshop
where
some
workmen
were
having
their
dinner
one
of
these
suggested
that
there
was
being
erected
at
cross
angel
street
a
new
cold
storage
building
and
as
this
suited
the
condition
of
a
newfangled
wareus
i
at
once
drove
to
it
an
interview
with
a
surly
gatekeeper
and
a
surlier
foreman
both
of
whom
were
appeased
with
the
coin
of
the
realm
put
me
on
the
track
of
bloxam
he
was
sent
for
on
my
suggesting
that
i
was
willing
to
pay
his
days
wages
to
his
foreman
for
the
privilege
of
asking
him
a
few
questions
on
a
private
matter
he
was
a
smart
enough
fellow
though
rough
of
speech
and
bearing
when
i
had
promised
to
pay
for
his
information
and
given
him
an
earnest
he
told
me
that
he
had
made
two
journeys
between
carfax
and
a
house
in
piccadilly
and
had
taken
from
this
house
to
the
latter
nine
great
boxesmain
heavy
oneswith
a
horse
and
cart
hired
by
him
for
this
purpose
i
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
the
number
of
the
house
in
piccadilly
to
which
he
replied
well
guvnor
i
forgits
the
number
but
it
was
only
a
few
doors
from
a
big
white
church
or
somethink
of
the
kind
not
long
built
it
was
a
dusty
old
ouse
too
though
nothin
to
the
dustiness
of
the
ouse
we
tooked
the
bloomin
boxes
from
how
did
you
get
into
the
houses
if
they
were
both
empty
there
was
the
old
party
what
engaged
me
awaitin
in
the
ouse
at
purfleet
he
elped
me
to
lift
the
boxes
and
put
them
in
the
dray
curse
me
but
he
was
the
strongest
chap
i
ever
struck
an
him
a
old
feller
with
a
white
moustache
one
that
thin
you
would
think
he
couldnt
throw
a
shadder
how
this
phrase
thrilled
through
me
why
e
took
up
is
end
o
the
boxes
like
they
was
pounds
of
tea

and

well

got
ome

interrupted
him
were
the
boxes
left
in
the
hall
yus
it
was
a
big
all
an
there
was
nothin
else
in
it
i
made
one
more
attempt
to
further
matters
you
didnt
have
any
key
never
used
no
key
nor
nothink
the
old
gent
he
opened
the
door
isself
an
shut
it
again
when
i
druv
off
i
dont
remember
the
last
timebut
that
was
the
beer
and
you
cant
remember
the
number
of
the
house
no
sir
but
ye
neednt
have
no
difficulty
about
that
its
a
igh
un
with
a
stone
front
with
a
bow
on
it
an
igh
steps
up
to
the
door
i
know
them
steps
avin
ad
to
carry
the
boxes
up
with
three
loafers
what
come
round
to
earn
a
copper
the
old
gent
give
them
shillins
an
they
seein
they
got
so
much
they
wanted
more
but
e
took
one
of
them
by
the
shoulder
and
was
like
to
throw
im
down
the
steps
till
the
lot
of
them
went
away
cussin
i
thought
that
with
this
description
i
could
find
the
house
so
having
paid
my
friend
for
his
information
i
started
off
for
piccadilly
i
had
gained
a
new
painful
experience
the
count
could
it
was
evident
handle
the
earthboxes
himself
if
so
time
was
precious
for
now
that
he
had
achieved
a
certain
amount
of
distribution
he
could
by
choosing
his
own
time
complete
the
task
unobserved
at
piccadilly
circus
i
discharged
my
cab
and
walked
westward
beyond
the
junior
constitutional
i
came
across
the
house
described
and
was
satisfied
that
this
was
the
next
of
the
lairs
arranged
by
dracula
the
house
looked
as
though
it
had
been
long
untenanted
the
windows
were
encrusted
with
dust
and
the
shutters
were
up
all
the
framework
was
black
with
time
and
from
the
iron
the
paint
had
mostly
scaled
away
it
was
evident
that
up
to
lately
there
had
been
a
large
noticeboard
in
front
of
the
balcony
it
had
however
been
roughly
torn
away
the
uprights
which
had
supported
it
still
remaining
behind
the
rails
of
the
balcony
i
saw
there
were
some
loose
boards
whose
raw
edges
looked
white
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
have
been
able
to
see
the
noticeboard
intact
as
it
would
perhaps
have
given
some
clue
to
the
ownership
of
the
house
i
remembered
my
experience
of
the
investigation
and
purchase
of
carfax
and
i
could
not
but
feel
that
if
i
could
find
the
former
owner
there
might
be
some
means
discovered
of
gaining
access
to
the
house
there
was
at
present
nothing
to
be
learned
from
the
piccadilly
side
and
nothing
could
be
done
so
i
went
round
to
the
back
to
see
if
anything
could
be
gathered
from
this
quarter
the
mews
were
active
the
piccadilly
houses
being
mostly
in
occupation
i
asked
one
or
two
of
the
grooms
and
helpers
whom
i
saw
around
if
they
could
tell
me
anything
about
the
empty
house
one
of
them
said
that
he
heard
it
had
lately
been
taken
but
he
couldnt
say
from
whom
he
told
me
however
that
up
to
very
lately
there
had
been
a
noticeboard
of
for
sale
up
and
that
perhaps
mitchell
sons

candy
the
house
agents
could
tell
me
something
as
he
thought
he
remembered
seeing
the
name
of
that
firm
on
the
board
i
did
not
wish
to
seem
too
eager
or
to
let
my
informant
know
or
guess
too
much
so
thanking
him
in
the
usual
manner
i
strolled
away
it
was
now
growing
dusk
and
the
autumn
night
was
closing
in
so
i
did
not
lose
any
time
having
learned
the
address
of
mitchell
sons

candy
from
a
directory
at
the
berkeley
i
was
soon
at
their
office
in
sackville
street
the
gentleman
who
saw
me
was
particularly
suave
in
manner
but
uncommunicative
in
equal
proportion
having
once
told
me
that
the
piccadilly
housewhich
throughout
our
interview
he
called
a
mansionwas
sold
he
considered
my
business
as
concluded
when
i
asked
who
had
purchased
it
he
opened
his
eyes
a
thought
wider
and
paused
a
few
seconds
before
replying
it
is
sold
sir
pardon
me
i
said
with
equal
politeness
but
i
have
a
special
reason
for
wishing
to
know
who
purchased
it
again
he
paused
longer
and
raised
his
eyebrows
still
more
it
is
sold
sir
was
again
his
laconic
reply
surely
i
said
you
do
not
mind
letting
me
know
so
much
but
i
do
mind
he
answered
the
affairs
of
their
clients
are
absolutely
safe
in
the
hands
of
mitchell
sons

candy
this
was
manifestly
a
prig
of
the
first
water
and
there
was
no
use
arguing
with
him
i
thought
i
had
best
meet
him
on
his
own
ground
so
i
said
your
clients
sir
are
happy
in
having
so
resolute
a
guardian
of
their
confidence
i
am
myself
a
professional
man
here
i
handed
him
my
card
in
this
instance
i
am
not
prompted
by
curiosity
i
act
on
the
part
of
lord
godalming
who
wishes
to
know
something
of
the
property
which
was
he
understood
lately
for
sale
these
words
put
a
different
complexion
on
affairs
he
said
i
would
like
to
oblige
you
if
i
could
mr
harker
and
especially
would
i
like
to
oblige
his
lordship
we
once
carried
out
a
small
matter
of
renting
some
chambers
for
him
when
he
was
the
honourable
arthur
holmwood
if
you
will
let
me
have
his
lordships
address
i
will
consult
the
house
on
the
subject
and
will
in
any
case
communicate
with
his
lordship
by
tonights
post
it
will
be
a
pleasure
if
we
can
so
far
deviate
from
our
rules
as
to
give
the
required
information
to
his
lordship
i
wanted
to
secure
a
friend
and
not
to
make
an
enemy
so
i
thanked
him
gave
the
address
at
dr
sewards
and
came
away
it
was
now
dark
and
i
was
tired
and
hungry
i
got
a
cup
of
tea
at
the
arated
bread
company
and
came
down
to
purfleet
by
the
next
train
i
found
all
the
others
at
home
mina
was
looking
tired
and
pale
but
she
made
a
gallant
effort
to
be
bright
and
cheerful
it
wrung
my
heart
to
think
that
i
had
had
to
keep
anything
from
her
and
so
caused
her
inquietude
thank
god
this
will
be
the
last
night
of
her
looking
on
at
our
conferences
and
feeling
the
sting
of
our
not
showing
our
confidence
it
took
all
my
courage
to
hold
to
the
wise
resolution
of
keeping
her
out
of
our
grim
task
she
seems
somehow
more
reconciled
or
else
the
very
subject
seems
to
have
become
repugnant
to
her
for
when
any
accidental
allusion
is
made
she
actually
shudders
i
am
glad
we
made
our
resolution
in
time
as
with
such
a
feeling
as
this
our
growing
knowledge
would
be
torture
to
her
i
could
not
tell
the
others
of
the
days
discovery
till
we
were
alone
so
after
dinnerfollowed
by
a
little
music
to
save
appearances
even
amongst
ourselvesi
took
mina
to
her
room
and
left
her
to
go
to
bed
the
dear
girl
was
more
affectionate
with
me
than
ever
and
clung
to
me
as
though
she
would
detain
me
but
there
was
much
to
be
talked
of
and
i
came
away
thank
god
the
ceasing
of
telling
things
has
made
no
difference
between
us
when
i
came
down
again
i
found
the
others
all
gathered
round
the
fire
in
the
study
in
the
train
i
had
written
my
diary
so
far
and
simply
read
it
off
to
them
as
the
best
means
of
letting
them
get
abreast
of
my
own
information
when
i
had
finished
van
helsing
said
this
has
been
a
great
days
work
friend
jonathan
doubtless
we
are
on
the
track
of
the
missing
boxes
if
we
find
them
all
in
that
house
then
our
work
is
near
the
end
but
if
there
be
some
missing
we
must
search
until
we
find
them
then
shall
we
make
our
final
coup
and
hunt
the
wretch
to
his
real
death
we
all
sat
silent
awhile
and
all
at
once
mr
morris
spoke
say
how
are
we
going
to
get
into
that
house
we
got
into
the
other
answered
lord
godalming
quickly
but
art
this
is
different
we
broke
house
at
carfax
but
we
had
night
and
a
walled
park
to
protect
us
it
will
be
a
mighty
different
thing
to
commit
burglary
in
piccadilly
either
by
day
or
night
i
confess
i
dont
see
how
we
are
going
to
get
in
unless
that
agency
duck
can
find
us
a
key
of
some
sort
perhaps
we
shall
know
when
you
get
his
letter
in
the
morning
lord
godalmings
brows
contracted
and
he
stood
up
and
walked
about
the
room
byandby
he
stopped
and
said
turning
from
one
to
another
of
us
quinceys
head
is
level
this
burglary
business
is
getting
serious
we
got
off
once
all
right
but
we
have
now
a
rare
job
on
handunless
we
can
find
the
counts
key
basket
as
nothing
could
well
be
done
before
morning
and
as
it
would
be
at
least
advisable
to
wait
till
lord
godalming
should
hear
from
mitchells
we
decided
not
to
take
any
active
step
before
breakfast
time
for
a
good
while
we
sat
and
smoked
discussing
the
matter
in
its
various
lights
and
bearings
i
took
the
opportunity
of
bringing
this
diary
right
up
to
the
moment
i
am
very
sleepy
and
shall
go
to
bed
just
a
line
mina
sleeps
soundly
and
her
breathing
is
regular
her
forehead
is
puckered
up
into
little
wrinkles
as
though
she
thinks
even
in
her
sleep
she
is
still
too
pale
but
does
not
look
so
haggard
as
she
did
this
morning
tomorrow
will
i
hope
mend
all
this
she
will
be
herself
at
home
in
exeter
oh
but
i
am
sleepy
dr
sewards
diary
1
octoberi
am
puzzled
afresh
about
renfield
his
moods
change
so
rapidly
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
keep
touch
of
them
and
as
they
always
mean
something
more
than
his
own
wellbeing
they
form
a
more
than
interesting
study
this
morning
when
i
went
to
see
him
after
his
repulse
of
van
helsing
his
manner
was
that
of
a
man
commanding
destiny
he
was
in
fact
commanding
destinysubjectively
he
did
not
really
care
for
any
of
the
things
of
mere
earth
he
was
in
the
clouds
and
looked
down
on
all
the
weaknesses
and
wants
of
us
poor
mortals
i
thought
i
would
improve
the
occasion
and
learn
something
so
i
asked
him
what
about
the
flies
these
times
he
smiled
on
me
in
quite
a
superior
sort
of
waysuch
a
smile
as
would
have
become
the
face
of
malvolioas
he
answered
me
the
fly
my
dear
sir
has
one
striking
feature
its
wings
are
typical
of
the
arial
powers
of
the
psychic
faculties
the
ancients
did
well
when
they
typified
the
soul
as
a
butterfly
i
thought
i
would
push
his
analogy
to
its
utmost
logically
so
i
said
quickly
oh
it
is
a
soul
you
are
after
now
is
it
his
madness
foiled
his
reason
and
a
puzzled
look
spread
over
his
face
as
shaking
his
head
with
a
decision
which
i
had
but
seldom
seen
in
him
he
said
oh
no
oh
no
i
want
no
souls
life
is
all
i
want
here
he
brightened
up
i
am
pretty
indifferent
about
it
at
present
life
is
all
right
i
have
all
i
want
you
must
get
a
new
patient
doctor
if
you
wish
to
study
zophagy
this
puzzled
me
a
little
so
i
drew
him
on
then
you
command
life
you
are
a
god
i
suppose
he
smiled
with
an
ineffably
benign
superiority
oh
no
far
be
it
from
me
to
arrogate
to
myself
the
attributes
of
the
deity
i
am
not
even
concerned
in
his
especially
spiritual
doings
if
i
may
state
my
intellectual
position
i
am
so
far
as
concerns
things
purely
terrestrial
somewhat
in
the
position
which
enoch
occupied
spiritually
this
was
a
poser
to
me
i
could
not
at
the
moment
recall
enochs
appositeness
so
i
had
to
ask
a
simple
question
though
i
felt
that
by
so
doing
i
was
lowering
myself
in
the
eyes
of
the
lunatic
and
why
with
enoch
because
he
walked
with
god
i
could
not
see
the
analogy
but
did
not
like
to
admit
it
so
i
harked
back
to
what
he
had
denied
so
you
dont
care
about
life
and
you
dont
want
souls
why
not
i
put
my
question
quickly
and
somewhat
sternly
on
purpose
to
disconcert
him
the
effort
succeeded
for
an
instant
he
unconsciously
relapsed
into
his
old
servile
manner
bent
low
before
me
and
actually
fawned
upon
me
as
he
replied
i
dont
want
any
souls
indeed
indeed
i
dont
i
couldnt
use
them
if
i
had
them
they
would
be
no
manner
of
use
to
me
i
couldnt
eat
them
or
he
suddenly
stopped
and
the
old
cunning
look
spread
over
his
face
like
a
windsweep
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
doctor
as
to
life
what
is
it
after
all
when
youve
got
all
you
require
and
you
know
that
you
will
never
want
that
is
all
i
have
friendsgood
friendslike
you
dr
seward
this
was
said
with
a
leer
of
inexpressible
cunning
i
know
that
i
shall
never
lack
the
means
of
life
i
think
that
through
the
cloudiness
of
his
insanity
he
saw
some
antagonism
in
me
for
he
at
once
fell
back
on
the
last
refuge
of
such
as
hea
dogged
silence
after
a
short
time
i
saw
that
for
the
present
it
was
useless
to
speak
to
him
he
was
sulky
and
so
i
came
away
later
in
the
day
he
sent
for
me
ordinarily
i
would
not
have
come
without
special
reason
but
just
at
present
i
am
so
interested
in
him
that
i
would
gladly
make
an
effort
besides
i
am
glad
to
have
anything
to
help
to
pass
the
time
harker
is
out
following
up
clues
and
so
are
lord
godalming
and
quincey
van
helsing
sits
in
my
study
poring
over
the
record
prepared
by
the
harkers
he
seems
to
think
that
by
accurate
knowledge
of
all
details
he
will
light
upon
some
clue
he
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
in
the
work
without
cause
i
would
have
taken
him
with
me
to
see
the
patient
only
i
thought
that
after
his
last
repulse
he
might
not
care
to
go
again
there
was
also
another
reason
renfield
might
not
speak
so
freely
before
a
third
person
as
when
he
and
i
were
alone
i
found
him
sitting
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
on
his
stool
a
pose
which
is
generally
indicative
of
some
mental
energy
on
his
part
when
i
came
in
he
said
at
once
as
though
the
question
had
been
waiting
on
his
lips
what
about
souls
it
was
evident
then
that
my
surmise
had
been
correct
unconscious
cerebration
was
doing
its
work
even
with
the
lunatic
i
determined
to
have
the
matter
out
what
about
them
yourself
i
asked
he
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
but
looked
all
round
him
and
up
and
down
as
though
he
expected
to
find
some
inspiration
for
an
answer
i
dont
want
any
souls
he
said
in
a
feeble
apologetic
way
the
matter
seemed
preying
on
his
mind
and
so
i
determined
to
use
itto
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind
so
i
said
you
like
life
and
you
want
life
oh
yes
but
that
is
all
right
you
neednt
worry
about
that
but
i
asked
how
are
we
to
get
the
life
without
getting
the
soul
also
this
seemed
to
puzzle
him
so
i
followed
it
up
a
nice
time
youll
have
some
time
when
youre
flying
out
there
with
the
souls
of
thousands
of
flies
and
spiders
and
birds
and
cats
buzzing
and
twittering
and
miauing
all
round
you
youve
got
their
lives
you
know
and
you
must
put
up
with
their
souls
something
seemed
to
affect
his
imagination
for
he
put
his
fingers
to
his
ears
and
shut
his
eyes
screwing
them
up
tightly
just
as
a
small
boy
does
when
his
face
is
being
soaped
there
was
something
pathetic
in
it
that
touched
me
it
also
gave
me
a
lesson
for
it
seemed
that
before
me
was
a
childonly
a
child
though
the
features
were
worn
and
the
stubble
on
the
jaws
was
white
it
was
evident
that
he
was
undergoing
some
process
of
mental
disturbance
and
knowing
how
his
past
moods
had
interpreted
things
seemingly
foreign
to
himself
i
thought
i
would
enter
into
his
mind
as
well
as
i
could
and
go
with
him
the
first
step
was
to
restore
confidence
so
i
asked
him
speaking
pretty
loud
so
that
he
would
hear
me
through
his
closed
ears
would
you
like
some
sugar
to
get
your
flies
round
again
he
seemed
to
wake
up
all
at
once
and
shook
his
head
with
a
laugh
he
replied
not
much
flies
are
poor
things
after
all
after
a
pause
he
added
but
i
dont
want
their
souls
buzzing
round
me
all
the
same
or
spiders
i
went
on
blow
spiders
whats
the
use
of
spiders
there
isnt
anything
in
them
to
eat
orhe
stopped
suddenly
as
though
reminded
of
a
forbidden
topic
so
so
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
the
second
time
he
has
suddenly
stopped
at
the
word
drink
what
does
it
mean
renfield
seemed
himself
aware
of
having
made
a
lapse
for
he
hurried
on
as
though
to
distract
my
attention
from
it
i
dont
take
any
stock
at
all
in
such
matters
rats
and
mice
and
such
small
deer
as
shakespeare
has
it
chickenfeed
of
the
larder
they
might
be
called
im
past
all
that
sort
of
nonsense
you
might
as
well
ask
a
man
to
eat
molecules
with
a
pair
of
chopsticks
as
to
try
to
interest
me
about
the
lesser
carnivora
when
i
know
of
what
is
before
me
i
see
i
said
you
want
big
things
that
you
can
make
your
teeth
meet
in
how
would
you
like
to
breakfast
on
elephant
what
ridiculous
nonsense
you
are
talking
he
was
getting
too
wide
awake
so
i
thought
i
would
press
him
hard
i
wonder
i
said
reflectively
what
an
elephants
soul
is
like
the
effect
i
desired
was
obtained
for
he
at
once
fell
from
his
highhorse
and
became
a
child
again
i
dont
want
an
elephants
soul
or
any
soul
at
all
he
said
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
despondently
suddenly
he
jumped
to
his
feet
with
his
eyes
blazing
and
all
the
signs
of
intense
cerebral
excitement
to
hell
with
you
and
your
souls
he
shouted
why
do
you
plague
me
about
souls
havent
i
got
enough
to
worry
and
pain
and
distract
me
already
without
thinking
of
souls
he
looked
so
hostile
that
i
thought
he
was
in
for
another
homicidal
fit
so
i
blew
my
whistle
the
instant
however
that
i
did
so
he
became
calm
and
said
apologetically
forgive
me
doctor
i
forgot
myself
you
do
not
need
any
help
i
am
so
worried
in
my
mind
that
i
am
apt
to
be
irritable
if
you
only
knew
the
problem
i
have
to
face
and
that
i
am
working
out
you
would
pity
and
tolerate
and
pardon
me
pray
do
not
put
me
in
a
straitwaistcoat
i
want
to
think
and
i
cannot
think
freely
when
my
body
is
confined
i
am
sure
you
will
understand
he
had
evidently
selfcontrol
so
when
the
attendants
came
i
told
them
not
to
mind
and
they
withdrew
renfield
watched
them
go
when
the
door
was
closed
he
said
with
considerable
dignity
and
sweetness
dr
seward
you
have
been
very
considerate
towards
me
believe
me
that
i
am
very
very
grateful
to
you
i
thought
it
well
to
leave
him
in
this
mood
and
so
i
came
away
there
is
certainly
something
to
ponder
over
in
this
mans
state
several
points
seem
to
make
what
the
american
interviewer
calls
a
story
if
one
could
only
get
them
in
proper
order
here
they
are
will
not
mention
drinking
fears
the
thought
of
being
burdened
with
the
soul
of
anything
has
no
dread
of
wanting
life
in
the
future
despises
the
meaner
forms
of
life
altogether
though
he
dreads
being
haunted
by
their
souls
logically
all
these
things
point
one
way
he
has
assurance
of
some
kind
that
he
will
acquire
some
higher
life
he
dreads
the
consequencethe
burden
of
a
soul
then
it
is
a
human
life
he
looks
to
and
the
assurance
merciful
god
the
count
has
been
to
him
and
there
is
some
new
scheme
of
terror
afoot





lateri
went
after
my
round
to
van
helsing
and
told
him
my
suspicion
he
grew
very
grave
and
after
thinking
the
matter
over
for
a
while
asked
me
to
take
him
to
renfield
i
did
so
as
we
came
to
the
door
we
heard
the
lunatic
within
singing
gaily
as
he
used
to
do
in
the
time
which
now
seems
so
long
ago
when
we
entered
we
saw
with
amazement
that
he
had
spread
out
his
sugar
as
of
old
the
flies
lethargic
with
the
autumn
were
beginning
to
buzz
into
the
room
we
tried
to
make
him
talk
of
the
subject
of
our
previous
conversation
but
he
would
not
attend
he
went
on
with
his
singing
just
as
though
we
had
not
been
present
he
had
got
a
scrap
of
paper
and
was
folding
it
into
a
notebook
we
had
to
come
away
as
ignorant
as
we
went
in
his
is
a
curious
case
indeed
we
must
watch
him

placed
a
man
in
the
corridor
last
night
and
told
him
to
make
an
accurate
note
of
any
sound
he
might
hear
from
renfields
room
and
gave
him
instructions
that
if
there
should
be
anything
strange
he
was
to
call
me
after
dinner
when
we
had
all
gathered
round
the
fire
in
the
studymrs
harker
having
gone
to
bedwe
discussed
the
attempts
and
discoveries
of
the
day
harker
was
the
only
one
who
had
any
result
and
we
are
in
great
hopes
that
his
clue
may
be
an
important
one
before
going
to
bed
i
went
round
to
the
patients
room
and
looked
in
through
the
observation
trap
he
was
sleeping
soundly
and
his
heart
rose
and
fell
with
regular
respiration
this
morning
the
man
on
duty
reported
to
me
that
a
little
after
midnight
he
was
restless
and
kept
saying
his
prayers
somewhat
loudly
i
asked
him
if
that
was
all
he
replied
that
it
was
all
he
heard
there
was
something
about
his
manner
so
suspicious
that
i
asked
him
point
blank
if
he
had
been
asleep
he
denied
sleep
but
admitted
to
having
dozed
for
a
while
it
is
too
bad
that
men
cannot
be
trusted
unless
they
are
watched
today
harker
is
out
following
up
his
clue
and
art
and
quincey
are
looking
after
horses
godalming
thinks
that
it
will
be
well
to
have
horses
always
in
readiness
for
when
we
get
the
information
which
we
seek
there
will
be
no
time
to
lose
we
must
sterilise
all
the
imported
earth
between
sunrise
and
sunset
we
shall
thus
catch
the
count
at
his
weakest
and
without
a
refuge
to
fly
to
van
helsing
is
off
to
the
british
museum
looking
up
some
authorities
on
ancient
medicine
the
old
physicians
took
account
of
things
which
their
followers
do
not
accept
and
the
professor
is
searching
for
witch
and
demon
cures
which
may
be
useful
to
us
later
i
sometimes
think
we
must
be
all
mad
and
that
we
shall
wake
to
sanity
in
straitwaistcoats





laterwe
have
met
again
we
seem
at
last
to
be
on
the
track
and
our
work
of
tomorrow
may
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
i
wonder
if
renfields
quiet
has
anything
to
do
with
this
his
moods
have
so
followed
the
doings
of
the
count
that
the
coming
destruction
of
the
monster
may
be
carried
to
him
in
some
subtle
way
if
we
could
only
get
some
hint
as
to
what
passed
in
his
mind
between
the
time
of
my
argument
with
him
today
and
his
resumption
of
flycatching
it
might
afford
us
a
valuable
clue
he
is
now
seemingly
quiet
for
a
spell
is
he
that
wild
yell
seemed
to
come
from
his
room





the
attendant
came
bursting
into
my
room
and
told
me
that
renfield
had
somehow
met
with
some
accident
he
had
heard
him
yell
and
when
he
went
to
him
found
him
lying
on
his
face
on
the
floor
all
covered
with
blood

octoberlet
me
put
down
with
exactness
all
that
happened
as
well
as
i
can
remember
it
since
last
i
made
an
entry
not
a
detail
that
i
can
recall
must
be
forgotten
in
all
calmness
i
must
proceed
when
i
came
to
renfields
room
i
found
him
lying
on
the
floor
on
his
left
side
in
a
glittering
pool
of
blood
when
i
went
to
move
him
it
became
at
once
apparent
that
he
had
received
some
terrible
injuries
there
seemed
none
of
that
unity
of
purpose
between
the
parts
of
the
body
which
marks
even
lethargic
sanity
as
the
face
was
exposed
i
could
see
that
it
was
horribly
bruised
as
though
it
had
been
beaten
against
the
floorindeed
it
was
from
the
face
wounds
that
the
pool
of
blood
originated
the
attendant
who
was
kneeling
beside
the
body
said
to
me
as
we
turned
him
over
i
think
sir
his
back
is
broken
see
both
his
right
arm
and
leg
and
the
whole
side
of
his
face
are
paralysed
how
such
a
thing
could
have
happened
puzzled
the
attendant
beyond
measure
he
seemed
quite
bewildered
and
his
brows
were
gathered
in
as
he
said
i
cant
understand
the
two
things
he
could
mark
his
face
like
that
by
beating
his
own
head
on
the
floor
i
saw
a
young
woman
do
it
once
at
the
eversfield
asylum
before
anyone
could
lay
hands
on
her
and
i
suppose
he
might
have
broke
his
neck
by
falling
out
of
bed
if
he
got
in
an
awkward
kink
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
cant
imagine
how
the
two
things
occurred
if
his
back
was
broke
he
couldnt
beat
his
head
and
if
his
face
was
like
that
before
the
fall
out
of
bed
there
would
be
marks
of
it
i
said
to
him
go
to
dr
van
helsing
and
ask
him
to
kindly
come
here
at
once
i
want
him
without
an
instants
delay
the
man
ran
off
and
within
a
few
minutes
the
professor
in
his
dressing
gown
and
slippers
appeared
when
he
saw
renfield
on
the
ground
he
looked
keenly
at
him
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
me
i
think
he
recognised
my
thought
in
my
eyes
for
he
said
very
quietly
manifestly
for
the
ears
of
the
attendant
ah
a
sad
accident
he
will
need
very
careful
watching
and
much
attention
i
shall
stay
with
you
myself
but
i
shall
first
dress
myself
if
you
will
remain
i
shall
in
a
few
minutes
join
you
the
patient
was
now
breathing
stertorously
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
suffered
some
terrible
injury
van
helsing
returned
with
extraordinary
celerity
bearing
with
him
a
surgical
case
he
had
evidently
been
thinking
and
had
his
mind
made
up
for
almost
before
he
looked
at
the
patient
he
whispered
to
me
send
the
attendant
away
we
must
be
alone
with
him
when
he
becomes
conscious
after
the
operation
so
i
said
i
think
that
will
do
now
simmons
we
have
done
all
that
we
can
at
present
you
had
better
go
your
round
and
dr
van
helsing
will
operate
let
me
know
instantly
if
there
be
anything
unusual
anywhere
the
man
withdrew
and
we
went
into
a
strict
examination
of
the
patient
the
wounds
of
the
face
was
superficial
the
real
injury
was
a
depressed
fracture
of
the
skull
extending
right
up
through
the
motor
area
the
professor
thought
a
moment
and
said
we
must
reduce
the
pressure
and
get
back
to
normal
conditions
as
far
as
can
be
the
rapidity
of
the
suffusion
shows
the
terrible
nature
of
his
injury
the
whole
motor
area
seems
affected
the
suffusion
of
the
brain
will
increase
quickly
so
we
must
trephine
at
once
or
it
may
be
too
late
as
he
was
speaking
there
was
a
soft
tapping
at
the
door
i
went
over
and
opened
it
and
found
in
the
corridor
without
arthur
and
quincey
in
pajamas
and
slippers
the
former
spoke
i
heard
your
man
call
up
dr
van
helsing
and
tell
him
of
an
accident
so
i
woke
quincey
or
rather
called
for
him
as
he
was
not
asleep
things
are
moving
too
quickly
and
too
strangely
for
sound
sleep
for
any
of
us
these
times
ive
been
thinking
that
tomorrow
night
will
not
see
things
as
they
have
been
well
have
to
look
backand
forward
a
little
more
than
we
have
done
may
we
come
in
i
nodded
and
held
the
door
open
till
they
had
entered
then
i
closed
it
again
when
quincey
saw
the
attitude
and
state
of
the
patient
and
noted
the
horrible
pool
on
the
floor
he
said
softly
my
god
what
has
happened
to
him
poor
poor
devil
i
told
him
briefly
and
added
that
we
expected
he
would
recover
consciousness
after
the
operationfor
a
short
time
at
all
events
he
went
at
once
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
godalming
beside
him
we
all
watched
in
patience
we
shall
wait
said
van
helsing
just
long
enough
to
fix
the
best
spot
for
trephining
so
that
we
may
most
quickly
and
perfectly
remove
the
blood
clot
for
it
is
evident
that
the
hmorrhage
is
increasing
the
minutes
during
which
we
waited
passed
with
fearful
slowness
i
had
a
horrible
sinking
in
my
heart
and
from
van
helsings
face
i
gathered
that
he
felt
some
fear
or
apprehension
as
to
what
was
to
come
i
dreaded
the
words
that
renfield
might
speak
i
was
positively
afraid
to
think
but
the
conviction
of
what
was
coming
was
on
me
as
i
have
read
of
men
who
have
heard
the
deathwatch
the
poor
mans
breathing
came
in
uncertain
gasps
each
instant
he
seemed
as
though
he
would
open
his
eyes
and
speak
but
then
would
follow
a
prolonged
stertorous
breath
and
he
would
relapse
into
a
more
fixed
insensibility
inured
as
i
was
to
sick
beds
and
death
this
suspense
grew
and
grew
upon
me
i
could
almost
hear
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
and
the
blood
surging
through
my
temples
sounded
like
blows
from
a
hammer
the
silence
finally
became
agonising
i
looked
at
my
companions
one
after
another
and
saw
from
their
flushed
faces
and
damp
brows
that
they
were
enduring
equal
torture
there
was
a
nervous
suspense
over
us
all
as
though
overhead
some
dread
bell
would
peal
out
powerfully
when
we
should
least
expect
it
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
it
was
evident
that
the
patient
was
sinking
fast
he
might
die
at
any
moment
i
looked
up
at
the
professor
and
caught
his
eyes
fixed
on
mine
his
face
was
sternly
set
as
he
spoke
there
is
no
time
to
lose
his
words
may
be
worth
many
lives
i
have
been
thinking
so
as
i
stood
here
it
may
be
there
is
a
soul
at
stake
we
shall
operate
just
above
the
ear
without
another
word
he
made
the
operation
for
a
few
moments
the
breathing
continued
to
be
stertorous
then
there
came
a
breath
so
prolonged
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
would
tear
open
his
chest
suddenly
his
eyes
opened
and
became
fixed
in
a
wild
helpless
stare
this
was
continued
for
a
few
moments
then
it
softened
into
a
glad
surprise
and
from
the
lips
came
a
sigh
of
relief
he
moved
convulsively
and
as
he
did
so
said
ill
be
quiet
doctor
tell
them
to
take
off
the
straitwaistcoat
i
have
had
a
terrible
dream
and
it
has
left
me
so
weak
that
i
cannot
move
whats
wrong
with
my
face
it
feels
all
swollen
and
it
smarts
dreadfully
he
tried
to
turn
his
head
but
even
with
the
effort
his
eyes
seemed
to
grow
glassy
again
so
i
gently
put
it
back
then
van
helsing
said
in
a
quiet
grave
tone
tell
us
your
dream
mr
renfield
as
he
heard
the
voice
his
face
brightened
through
its
mutilation
and
he
said
that
is
dr
van
helsing
how
good
it
is
of
you
to
be
here
give
me
some
water
my
lips
are
dry
and
i
shall
try
to
tell
you
i
dreamedhe
stopped
and
seemed
fainting
i
called
quietly
to
quinceythe
brandyit
is
in
my
studyquick
he
flew
and
returned
with
a
glass
the
decanter
of
brandy
and
a
carafe
of
water
we
moistened
the
parched
lips
and
the
patient
quickly
revived
it
seemed
however
that
his
poor
injured
brain
had
been
working
in
the
interval
for
when
he
was
quite
conscious
he
looked
at
me
piercingly
with
an
agonised
confusion
which
i
shall
never
forget
and
said
i
must
not
deceive
myself
it
was
no
dream
but
all
a
grim
reality
then
his
eyes
roved
round
the
room
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
two
figures
sitting
patiently
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
went
on
if
i
were
not
sure
already
i
would
know
from
them
for
an
instant
his
eyes
closednot
with
pain
or
sleep
but
voluntarily
as
though
he
were
bringing
all
his
faculties
to
bear
when
he
opened
them
he
said
hurriedly
and
with
more
energy
than
he
had
yet
displayed
quick
doctor
quick
i
am
dying
i
feel
that
i
have
but
a
few
minutes
and
then
i
must
go
back
to
deathor
worse
wet
my
lips
with
brandy
again
i
have
something
that
i
must
say
before
i
die
or
before
my
poor
crushed
brain
dies
anyhow
thank
you
it
was
that
night
after
you
left
me
when
i
implored
you
to
let
me
go
away
i
couldnt
speak
then
for
i
felt
my
tongue
was
tied
but
i
was
as
sane
then
except
in
that
way
as
i
am
now
i
was
in
an
agony
of
despair
for
a
long
time
after
you
left
me
it
seemed
hours
then
there
came
a
sudden
peace
to
me
my
brain
seemed
to
become
cool
again
and
i
realised
where
i
was
i
heard
the
dogs
bark
behind
our
house
but
not
where
he
was
as
he
spoke
van
helsings
eyes
never
blinked
but
his
hand
came
out
and
met
mine
and
gripped
it
hard
he
did
not
however
betray
himself
he
nodded
slightly
and
said
go
on
in
a
low
voice
renfield
proceeded
he
came
up
to
the
window
in
the
mist
as
i
had
seen
him
often
before
but
he
was
solid
thennot
a
ghost
and
his
eyes
were
fierce
like
a
mans
when
angry
he
was
laughing
with
his
red
mouth
the
sharp
white
teeth
glinted
in
the
moonlight
when
he
turned
to
look
back
over
the
belt
of
trees
to
where
the
dogs
were
barking
i
wouldnt
ask
him
to
come
in
at
first
though
i
knew
he
wanted
tojust
as
he
had
wanted
all
along
then
he
began
promising
me
thingsnot
in
words
but
by
doing
them
he
was
interrupted
by
a
word
from
the
professor
how
by
making
them
happen
just
as
he
used
to
send
in
the
flies
when
the
sun
was
shining
great
big
fat
ones
with
steel
and
sapphire
on
their
wings
and
big
moths
in
the
night
with
skull
and
crossbones
on
their
backs
van
helsing
nodded
to
him
as
he
whispered
to
me
unconsciously
the
acherontia
aitetropos
of
the
sphingeswhat
you
call
the
deathshead
moth
the
patient
went
on
without
stopping
then
he
began
to
whisper
rats
rats
rats
hundreds
thousands
millions
of
them
and
every
one
a
life
and
dogs
to
eat
them
and
cats
too
all
lives
all
red
blood
with
years
of
life
in
it
and
not
merely
buzzing
flies
i
laughed
at
him
for
i
wanted
to
see
what
he
could
do
then
the
dogs
howled
away
beyond
the
dark
trees
in
his
house
he
beckoned
me
to
the
window
i
got
up
and
looked
out
and
he
raised
his
hands
and
seemed
to
call
out
without
using
any
words
a
dark
mass
spread
over
the
grass
coming
on
like
the
shape
of
a
flame
of
fire
and
then
he
moved
the
mist
to
the
right
and
left
and
i
could
see
that
there
were
thousands
of
rats
with
their
eyes
blazing
redlike
his
only
smaller
he
held
up
his
hand
and
they
all
stopped
and
i
thought
he
seemed
to
be
saying
all
these
lives
will
i
give
you
ay
and
many
more
and
greater
through
countless
ages
if
you
will
fall
down
and
worship
me
and
then
a
red
cloud
like
the
colour
of
blood
seemed
to
close
over
my
eyes
and
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
found
myself
opening
the
sash
and
saying
to
him
come
in
lord
and
master
the
rats
were
all
gone
but
he
slid
into
the
room
through
the
sash
though
it
was
only
open
an
inch
widejust
as
the
moon
herself
has
often
come
in
through
the
tiniest
crack
and
has
stood
before
me
in
all
her
size
and
splendour
his
voice
was
weaker
so
i
moistened
his
lips
with
the
brandy
again
and
he
continued
but
it
seemed
as
though
his
memory
had
gone
on
working
in
the
interval
for
his
story
was
further
advanced
i
was
about
to
call
him
back
to
the
point
but
van
helsing
whispered
to
me
let
him
go
on
do
not
interrupt
him
he
cannot
go
back
and
maybe
could
not
proceed
at
all
if
once
he
lost
the
thread
of
his
thought
he
proceeded
all
day
i
waited
to
hear
from
him
but
he
did
not
send
me
anything
not
even
a
blowfly
and
when
the
moon
got
up
i
was
pretty
angry
with
him
when
he
slid
in
through
the
window
though
it
was
shut
and
did
not
even
knock
i
got
mad
with
him
he
sneered
at
me
and
his
white
face
looked
out
of
the
mist
with
his
red
eyes
gleaming
and
he
went
on
as
though
he
owned
the
whole
place
and
i
was
no
one
he
didnt
even
smell
the
same
as
he
went
by
me
i
couldnt
hold
him
i
thought
that
somehow
mrs
harker
had
come
into
the
room
the
two
men
sitting
on
the
bed
stood
up
and
came
over
standing
behind
him
so
that
he
could
not
see
them
but
where
they
could
hear
better
they
were
both
silent
but
the
professor
started
and
quivered
his
face
however
grew
grimmer
and
sterner
still
renfield
went
on
without
noticing
when
mrs
harker
came
in
to
see
me
this
afternoon
she
wasnt
the
same
it
was
like
tea
after
the
teapot
had
been
watered
here
we
all
moved
but
no
one
said
a
word
he
went
on
i
didnt
know
that
she
was
here
till
she
spoke
and
she
didnt
look
the
same
i
dont
care
for
the
pale
people
i
like
them
with
lots
of
blood
in
them
and
hers
had
all
seemed
to
have
run
out
i
didnt
think
of
it
at
the
time
but
when
she
went
away
i
began
to
think
and
it
made
me
mad
to
know
that
he
had
been
taking
the
life
out
of
her
i
could
feel
that
the
rest
quivered
as
i
did
but
we
remained
otherwise
still
so
when
he
came
tonight
i
was
ready
for
him
i
saw
the
mist
stealing
in
and
i
grabbed
it
tight
i
had
heard
that
madmen
have
unnatural
strength
and
as
i
knew
i
was
a
madmanat
times
anyhowi
resolved
to
use
my
power
ay
and
he
felt
it
too
for
he
had
to
come
out
of
the
mist
to
struggle
with
me
i
held
tight
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
win
for
i
didnt
mean
him
to
take
any
more
of
her
life
till
i
saw
his
eyes
they
burned
into
me
and
my
strength
became
like
water
he
slipped
through
it
and
when
i
tried
to
cling
to
him
he
raised
me
up
and
flung
me
down
there
was
a
red
cloud
before
me
and
a
noise
like
thunder
and
the
mist
seemed
to
steal
away
under
the
door
his
voice
was
becoming
fainter
and
his
breath
more
stertorous
van
helsing
stood
up
instinctively
we
know
the
worst
now
he
said
he
is
here
and
we
know
his
purpose
it
may
not
be
too
late
let
us
be
armedthe
same
as
we
were
the
other
night
but
lose
no
time
there
is
not
an
instant
to
spare
there
was
no
need
to
put
our
fear
nay
our
conviction
into
wordswe
shared
them
in
common
we
all
hurried
and
took
from
our
rooms
the
same
things
that
we
had
when
we
entered
the
counts
house
the
professor
had
his
ready
and
as
we
met
in
the
corridor
he
pointed
to
them
significantly
as
he
said
they
never
leave
me
and
they
shall
not
till
this
unhappy
business
is
over
be
wise
also
my
friends
it
is
no
common
enemy
that
we
deal
with
alas
alas
that
that
dear
madam
mina
should
suffer
he
stopped
his
voice
was
breaking
and
i
do
not
know
if
rage
or
terror
predominated
in
my
own
heart
outside
the
harkers
door
we
paused
art
and
quincey
held
back
and
the
latter
said
should
we
disturb
her
we
must
said
van
helsing
grimly
if
the
door
be
locked
i
shall
break
it
in
may
it
not
frighten
her
terribly
it
is
unusual
to
break
into
a
ladys
room
van
helsing
said
solemnly
you
are
always
right
but
this
is
life
and
death
all
chambers
are
alike
to
the
doctor
and
even
were
they
not
they
are
all
as
one
to
me
tonight
friend
john
when
i
turn
the
handle
if
the
door
does
not
open
do
you
put
your
shoulder
down
and
shove
and
you
too
my
friends
now
he
turned
the
handle
as
he
spoke
but
the
door
did
not
yield
we
threw
ourselves
against
it
with
a
crash
it
burst
open
and
we
almost
fell
headlong
into
the
room
the
professor
did
actually
fall
and
i
saw
across
him
as
he
gathered
himself
up
from
hands
and
knees
what
i
saw
appalled
me
i
felt
my
hair
rise
like
bristles
on
the
back
of
my
neck
and
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
the
moonlight
was
so
bright
that
through
the
thick
yellow
blind
the
room
was
light
enough
to
see
on
the
bed
beside
the
window
lay
jonathan
harker
his
face
flushed
and
breathing
heavily
as
though
in
a
stupor
kneeling
on
the
near
edge
of
the
bed
facing
outwards
was
the
whiteclad
figure
of
his
wife
by
her
side
stood
a
tall
thin
man
clad
in
black
his
face
was
turned
from
us
but
the
instant
we
saw
we
all
recognised
the
countin
every
way
even
to
the
scar
on
his
forehead
with
his
left
hand
he
held
both
mrs
harkers
hands
keeping
them
away
with
her
arms
at
full
tension
his
right
hand
gripped
her
by
the
back
of
the
neck
forcing
her
face
down
on
his
bosom
her
white
nightdress
was
smeared
with
blood
and
a
thin
stream
trickled
down
the
mans
bare
breast
which
was
shown
by
his
tornopen
dress
the
attitude
of
the
two
had
a
terrible
resemblance
to
a
child
forcing
a
kittens
nose
into
a
saucer
of
milk
to
compel
it
to
drink
as
we
burst
into
the
room
the
count
turned
his
face
and
the
hellish
look
that
i
had
heard
described
seemed
to
leap
into
it
his
eyes
flamed
red
with
devilish
passion
the
great
nostrils
of
the
white
aquiline
nose
opened
wide
and
quivered
at
the
edge
and
the
white
sharp
teeth
behind
the
full
lips
of
the
blooddripping
mouth
champed
together
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
with
a
wrench
which
threw
his
victim
back
upon
the
bed
as
though
hurled
from
a
height
he
turned
and
sprang
at
us
but
by
this
time
the
professor
had
gained
his
feet
and
was
holding
towards
him
the
envelope
which
contained
the
sacred
wafer
the
count
suddenly
stopped
just
as
poor
lucy
had
done
outside
the
tomb
and
cowered
back
further
and
further
back
he
cowered
as
we
lifting
our
crucifixes
advanced
the
moonlight
suddenly
failed
as
a
great
black
cloud
sailed
across
the
sky
and
when
the
gaslight
sprang
up
under
quinceys
match
we
saw
nothing
but
a
faint
vapour
this
as
we
looked
trailed
under
the
door
which
with
the
recoil
from
its
bursting
open
had
swung
back
to
its
old
position
van
helsing
art
and
i
moved
forward
to
mrs
harker
who
by
this
time
had
drawn
her
breath
and
with
it
had
given
a
scream
so
wild
so
earpiercing
so
despairing
that
it
seems
to
me
now
that
it
will
ring
in
my
ears
till
my
dying
day
for
a
few
seconds
she
lay
in
her
helpless
attitude
and
disarray
her
face
was
ghastly
with
a
pallor
which
was
accentuated
by
the
blood
which
smeared
her
lips
and
cheeks
and
chin
from
her
throat
trickled
a
thin
stream
of
blood
her
eyes
were
mad
with
terror
then
she
put
before
her
face
her
poor
crushed
hands
which
bore
on
their
whiteness
the
red
mark
of
the
counts
terrible
grip
and
from
behind
them
came
a
low
desolate
wail
which
made
the
terrible
scream
seem
only
the
quick
expression
of
an
endless
grief
van
helsing
stepped
forward
and
drew
the
coverlet
gently
over
her
body
whilst
art
after
looking
at
her
face
for
an
instant
despairingly
ran
out
of
the
room
van
helsing
whispered
to
me
jonathan
is
in
a
stupor
such
as
we
know
the
vampire
can
produce
we
can
do
nothing
with
poor
madam
mina
for
a
few
moments
till
she
recovers
herself
i
must
wake
him
he
dipped
the
end
of
a
towel
in
cold
water
and
with
it
began
to
flick
him
on
the
face
his
wife
all
the
while
holding
her
face
between
her
hands
and
sobbing
in
a
way
that
was
heartbreaking
to
hear
i
raised
the
blind
and
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
much
moonshine
and
as
i
looked
i
could
see
quincey
morris
run
across
the
lawn
and
hide
himself
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
yewtree
it
puzzled
me
to
think
why
he
was
doing
this
but
at
the
instant
i
heard
harkers
quick
exclamation
as
he
woke
to
partial
consciousness
and
turned
to
the
bed
on
his
face
as
there
might
well
be
was
a
look
of
wild
amazement
he
seemed
dazed
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
full
consciousness
seemed
to
burst
upon
him
all
at
once
and
he
started
up
his
wife
was
aroused
by
the
quick
movement
and
turned
to
him
with
her
arms
stretched
out
as
though
to
embrace
him
instantly
however
she
drew
them
in
again
and
putting
her
elbows
together
held
her
hands
before
her
face
and
shuddered
till
the
bed
beneath
her
shook
in
gods
name
what
does
this
mean
harker
cried
out
dr
seward
dr
van
helsing
what
is
it
what
has
happened
what
is
wrong
mina
dear
what
is
it
what
does
that
blood
mean
my
god
my
god
has
it
come
to
this
and
raising
himself
to
his
knees
he
beat
his
hands
wildly
together
good
god
help
us
help
her
oh
help
her
with
a
quick
movement
he
jumped
from
bed
and
began
to
pull
on
his
clothesall
the
man
in
him
awake
at
the
need
for
instant
exertion
what
has
happened
tell
me
all
about
it
he
cried
without
pausing
dr
van
helsing
you
love
mina
i
know
oh
do
something
to
save
her
it
cannot
have
gone
too
far
yet
guard
her
while
i
look
for
him
his
wife
through
her
terror
and
horror
and
distress
saw
some
sure
danger
to
him
instantly
forgetting
her
own
grief
she
seized
hold
of
him
and
cried
out
no
no
jonathan
you
must
not
leave
me
i
have
suffered
enough
tonight
god
knows
without
the
dread
of
his
harming
you
you
must
stay
with
me
stay
with
these
friends
who
will
watch
over
you
her
expression
became
frantic
as
she
spoke
and
he
yielding
to
her
she
pulled
him
down
sitting
on
the
bed
side
and
clung
to
him
fiercely
van
helsing
and
i
tried
to
calm
them
both
the
professor
held
up
his
little
golden
crucifix
and
said
with
wonderful
calmness
do
not
fear
my
dear
we
are
here
and
whilst
this
is
close
to
you
no
foul
thing
can
approach
you
are
safe
for
tonight
and
we
must
be
calm
and
take
counsel
together
she
shuddered
and
was
silent
holding
down
her
head
on
her
husbands
breast
when
she
raised
it
his
white
nightrobe
was
stained
with
blood
where
her
lips
had
touched
and
where
the
thin
open
wound
in
her
neck
had
sent
forth
drops
the
instant
she
saw
it
she
drew
back
with
a
low
wail
and
whispered
amidst
choking
sobs
unclean
unclean
i
must
touch
him
or
kiss
him
no
more
oh
that
it
should
be
that
it
is
i
who
am
now
his
worst
enemy
and
whom
he
may
have
most
cause
to
fear
to
this
he
spoke
out
resolutely
nonsense
mina
it
is
a
shame
to
me
to
hear
such
a
word
i
would
not
hear
it
of
you
and
i
shall
not
hear
it
from
you
may
god
judge
me
by
my
deserts
and
punish
me
with
more
bitter
suffering
than
even
this
hour
if
by
any
act
or
will
of
mine
anything
ever
come
between
us
he
put
out
his
arms
and
folded
her
to
his
breast
and
for
a
while
she
lay
there
sobbing
he
looked
at
us
over
her
bowed
head
with
eyes
that
blinked
damply
above
his
quivering
nostrils
his
mouth
was
set
as
steel
after
a
while
her
sobs
became
less
frequent
and
more
faint
and
then
he
said
to
me
speaking
with
a
studied
calmness
which
i
felt
tried
his
nervous
power
to
the
utmost
and
now
dr
seward
tell
me
all
about
it
too
well
i
know
the
broad
fact
tell
me
all
that
has
been
i
told
him
exactly
what
had
happened
and
he
listened
with
seeming
impassiveness
but
his
nostrils
twitched
and
his
eyes
blazed
as
i
told
how
the
ruthless
hands
of
the
count
had
held
his
wife
in
that
terrible
and
horrid
position
with
her
mouth
to
the
open
wound
in
his
breast
it
interested
me
even
at
that
moment
to
see
that
whilst
the
face
of
white
set
passion
worked
convulsively
over
the
bowed
head
the
hands
tenderly
and
lovingly
stroked
the
ruffled
hair
just
as
i
had
finished
quincey
and
godalming
knocked
at
the
door
they
entered
in
obedience
to
our
summons
van
helsing
looked
at
me
questioningly
i
understood
him
to
mean
if
we
were
to
take
advantage
of
their
coming
to
divert
if
possible
the
thoughts
of
the
unhappy
husband
and
wife
from
each
other
and
from
themselves
so
on
nodding
acquiescence
to
him
he
asked
them
what
they
had
seen
or
done
to
which
lord
godalming
answered
i
could
not
see
him
anywhere
in
the
passage
or
in
any
of
our
rooms
i
looked
in
the
study
but
though
he
had
been
there
he
had
gone
he
had
however
he
stopped
suddenly
looking
at
the
poor
drooping
figure
on
the
bed
van
helsing
said
gravely
go
on
friend
arthur
we
want
here
no
more
concealments
our
hope
now
is
in
knowing
all
tell
freely
so
art
went
on
he
had
been
there
and
though
it
could
only
have
been
for
a
few
seconds
he
made
rare
hay
of
the
place
all
the
manuscript
had
been
burned
and
the
blue
flames
were
flickering
amongst
the
white
ashes
the
cylinders
of
your
phonograph
too
were
thrown
on
the
fire
and
the
wax
had
helped
the
flames
here
i
interrupted
thank
god
there
is
the
other
copy
in
the
safe
his
face
lit
for
a
moment
but
fell
again
as
he
went
on
i
ran
downstairs
then
but
could
see
no
sign
of
him
i
looked
into
renfields
room
but
there
was
no
trace
there
except
again
he
paused
go
on
said
harker
hoarsely
so
he
bowed
his
head
and
moistening
his
lips
with
his
tongue
added
except
that
the
poor
fellow
is
dead
mrs
harker
raised
her
head
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
she
said
solemnly
gods
will
be
done
i
could
not
but
feel
that
art
was
keeping
back
something
but
as
i
took
it
that
it
was
with
a
purpose
i
said
nothing
van
helsing
turned
to
morris
and
asked
and
you
friend
quincey
have
you
any
to
tell
a
little
he
answered
it
may
be
much
eventually
but
at
present
i
cant
say
i
thought
it
well
to
know
if
possible
where
the
count
would
go
when
he
left
the
house
i
did
not
see
him
but
i
saw
a
bat
rise
from
renfields
window
and
flap
westward
i
expected
to
see
him
in
some
shape
go
back
to
carfax
but
he
evidently
sought
some
other
lair
he
will
not
be
back
tonight
for
the
sky
is
reddening
in
the
east
and
the
dawn
is
close
we
must
work
tomorrow
he
said
the
latter
words
through
his
shut
teeth
for
a
space
of
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
there
was
silence
and
i
could
fancy
that
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
our
hearts
beating
then
van
helsing
said
placing
his
hand
very
tenderly
on
mrs
harkers
head
and
now
madam
minapoor
dear
dear
madam
minatell
us
exactly
what
happened
god
knows
that
i
do
not
want
that
you
be
pained
but
it
is
need
that
we
know
all
for
now
more
than
ever
has
all
work
to
be
done
quick
and
sharp
and
in
deadly
earnest
the
day
is
close
to
us
that
must
end
all
if
it
may
be
so
and
now
is
the
chance
that
we
may
live
and
learn
the
poor
dear
lady
shivered
and
i
could
see
the
tension
of
her
nerves
as
she
clasped
her
husband
closer
to
her
and
bent
her
head
lower
and
lower
still
on
his
breast
then
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
held
out
one
hand
to
van
helsing
who
took
it
in
his
and
after
stooping
and
kissing
it
reverently
held
it
fast
the
other
hand
was
locked
in
that
of
her
husband
who
held
his
other
arm
thrown
round
her
protectingly
after
a
pause
in
which
she
was
evidently
ordering
her
thoughts
she
began
i
took
the
sleeping
draught
which
you
had
so
kindly
given
me
but
for
a
long
time
it
did
not
act
i
seemed
to
become
more
wakeful
and
myriads
of
horrible
fancies
began
to
crowd
in
upon
my
mindall
of
them
connected
with
death
and
vampires
with
blood
and
pain
and
trouble
her
husband
involuntarily
groaned
as
she
turned
to
him
and
said
lovingly
do
not
fret
dear
you
must
be
brave
and
strong
and
help
me
through
the
horrible
task
if
you
only
knew
what
an
effort
it
is
to
me
to
tell
of
this
fearful
thing
at
all
you
would
understand
how
much
i
need
your
help
well
i
saw
i
must
try
to
help
the
medicine
to
its
work
with
my
will
if
it
was
to
do
me
any
good
so
i
resolutely
set
myself
to
sleep
sure
enough
sleep
must
soon
have
come
to
me
for
i
remember
no
more
jonathan
coming
in
had
not
waked
me
for
he
lay
by
my
side
when
next
i
remember
there
was
in
the
room
the
same
thin
white
mist
that
i
had
before
noticed
but
i
forget
now
if
you
know
of
this
you
will
find
it
in
my
diary
which
i
shall
show
you
later
i
felt
the
same
vague
terror
which
had
come
to
me
before
and
the
same
sense
of
some
presence
i
turned
to
wake
jonathan
but
found
that
he
slept
so
soundly
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
he
who
had
taken
the
sleeping
draught
and
not
i
i
tried
but
i
could
not
wake
him
this
caused
me
a
great
fear
and
i
looked
around
terrified
then
indeed
my
heart
sank
within
me
beside
the
bed
as
if
he
had
stepped
out
of
the
mistor
rather
as
if
the
mist
had
turned
into
his
figure
for
it
had
entirely
disappearedstood
a
tall
thin
man
all
in
black
i
knew
him
at
once
from
the
description
of
the
others
the
waxen
face
the
high
aquiline
nose
on
which
the
light
fell
in
a
thin
white
line
the
parted
red
lips
with
the
sharp
white
teeth
showing
between
and
the
red
eyes
that
i
had
seemed
to
see
in
the
sunset
on
the
windows
of
st
marys
church
at
whitby
i
knew
too
the
red
scar
on
his
forehead
where
jonathan
had
struck
him
for
an
instant
my
heart
stood
still
and
i
would
have
screamed
out
only
that
i
was
paralysed
in
the
pause
he
spoke
in
a
sort
of
keen
cutting
whisper
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
jonathan
silence
if
you
make
a
sound
i
shall
take
him
and
dash
his
brains
out
before
your
very
eyes
i
was
appalled
and
was
too
bewildered
to
do
or
say
anything
with
a
mocking
smile
he
placed
one
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
holding
me
tight
bared
my
throat
with
the
other
saying
as
he
did
so
first
a
little
refreshment
to
reward
my
exertions
you
may
as
well
be
quiet
it
is
not
the
first
time
or
the
second
that
your
veins
have
appeased
my
thirst
i
was
bewildered
and
strangely
enough
i
did
not
want
to
hinder
him
i
suppose
it
is
a
part
of
the
horrible
curse
that
such
is
when
his
touch
is
on
his
victim
and
oh
my
god
my
god
pity
me
he
placed
his
reeking
lips
upon
my
throat
her
husband
groaned
again
she
clasped
his
hand
harder
and
looked
at
him
pityingly
as
if
he
were
the
injured
one
and
went
on
i
felt
my
strength
fading
away
and
i
was
in
a
half
swoon
how
long
this
horrible
thing
lasted
i
know
not
but
it
seemed
that
a
long
time
must
have
passed
before
he
took
his
foul
awful
sneering
mouth
away
i
saw
it
drip
with
the
fresh
blood
the
remembrance
seemed
for
a
while
to
overpower
her
and
she
drooped
and
would
have
sunk
down
but
for
her
husbands
sustaining
arm
with
a
great
effort
she
recovered
herself
and
went
on
then
he
spoke
to
me
mockingly
and
so
you
like
the
others
would
play
your
brains
against
mine
you
would
help
these
men
to
hunt
me
and
frustrate
me
in
my
designs
you
know
now
and
they
know
in
part
already
and
will
know
in
full
before
long
what
it
is
to
cross
my
path
they
should
have
kept
their
energies
for
use
closer
to
home
whilst
they
played
wits
against
meagainst
me
who
commanded
nations
and
intrigued
for
them
and
fought
for
them
hundreds
of
years
before
they
were
borni
was
countermining
them
and
you
their
best
beloved
one
are
now
to
me

of
my
flesh
blood
of
my
blood
kin
of
my
kin
my
bountiful
winepress
for
a
while
and
shall
be
later
on
my
companion
and
my
helper
you
shall
be
avenged
in
turn
for
not
one
of
them
but
shall
minister
to
your
needs
but
as
yet
you
are
to
be
punished
for
what
you
have
done
you
have
aided
in
thwarting
me
now
you
shall
come
to
my
call
when
my
brain
says
come
to
you
you
shall
cross
land
or
sea
to
do
my
bidding
and
to
that
end
this
with
that
he
pulled
open
his
shirt
and
with
his
long
sharp
nails
opened
a
vein
in
his
breast
when
the
blood
began
to
spurt
out
he
took
my
hands
in
one
of
his
holding
them
tight
and
with
the
other
seized
my
neck
and
pressed
my
mouth
to
the
wound
so
that
i
must
either
suffocate
or
swallow
some
of
the
oh
my
god
my
god
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
such
a
fate

down
on
a
poor
soul
in
worse
than
mortal
peril
and
in
mercy
pity
those
to
whom
she
is
dear
then
she
began
to
rub
her
lips
as
though
to
cleanse
them
from
pollution
as
she
was
telling
her
terrible
story
the
eastern
sky
began
to
quicken
and
everything
became
more
and
more
clear
harker
was
still
and
quiet
but
over
his
face
as
the
awful
narrative
went
on
came
a
grey
look
which
deepened
and
deepened
in
the
morning
light
till
when
the
first
red
streak
of
the
coming
dawn
shot
up
the
flesh
stood
darkly
out
against
the
whitening
hair
we
have
arranged
that
one
of
us
is
to
stay
within

of
the
unhappy
pair
till
we
can
meet
together
and
arrange
about

am
sure
the

we

half
an

and

for
dr

are

that

at

i
dare
not

to

at

today
however
we
must
trust
and
hope
poor
mina
told
me
just
now
with
the
tears
running
down
her
dear
cheeks
that
it
is
in
trouble
and
trial
that
our
faith
is
testedthat
we
must
keep
on
trusting
and
that
god
will
aid
us
up
to
the
end
the
end
oh
my
god
what
end
to
work
to
work
when
dr
van
helsing
and
dr
seward
had
come
back
from
seeing
poor
renfield
we
went
gravely
into
what
was
to
be
done
first
dr
seward
told
us
that
when
he
and
dr
van
helsing
had
gone
down
to
the
room
below
they
had
found
renfield
lying
on
the
floor
all
in
a
heap
his
face
was
all
bruised
and
crushed
in
and
the
bones
of
the
neck
were
broken
dr
seward
asked
the
attendant
who
was
on
duty
in
the
passage
if
he
had
heard
anything
he
said
that
he
had
been
sitting
downhe
confessed
to
half
dozingwhen
he
heard
loud
voices
in
the
room
and
then
renfield
had
called
out
loudly
several
times
god
god
god
after
that
there
was
a
sound
of
falling
and
when
he
entered
the
room
he
found
him
lying
on
the
floor
face
down
just
as
the
doctors
had
seen
him
van
helsing
asked
if
he
had
heard
voices
or
a
voice
and
he
said
he
could
not
say
that
at
first
it
had
seemed
to
him
as
if
there
were
two
but
as
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
it
could
have
been
only
one
he
could
swear
to
it
if
required
that
the
word
god
was
spoken
by
the
patient
dr
seward
said
to
us
when
we
were
alone
that
he
did
not
wish
to
go
into
the
matter
the
question
of
an
inquest
had
to
be
considered
and
it
would
never
do
to
put
forward
the
truth
as
no
one
would
believe
it
as
it
was
he
thought
that
on
the
attendants
evidence
he
could
give
a
certificate
of
death
by
misadventure
in
falling
from
bed
in
case
the
coroner
should
demand
it
there
would
be
a
formal
inquest
necessarily
to
the
same
result
when
the
question
began
to
be
discussed
as
to
what
should
be
our
next
step
the
very
first
thing
we
decided
was
that
mina
should
be
in
full
confidence
that
nothing
of
any
sortno
matter
how
painfulshould
be
kept
from
her
she
herself
agreed
as
to
its
wisdom
and
it
was
pitiful
to
see
her
so
brave
and
yet
so
sorrowful
and
in
such
a
depth
of
despair
there
must
be
no
concealment
she
said
alas
we
have
had
too
much
already
and
besides
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
that
can
give
me
more
pain
than
i
have
already
enduredthan
i
suffer
now
whatever
may
happen
it
must
be
of
new
hope
or
of
new
courage
to
me
van
helsing
was
looking
at
her
fixedly
as
she
spoke
and
said
suddenly
but
quietly
but
dear
madam
mina
are
you
not
afraid
not
for
yourself
but
for
others
from
yourself
after
what
has
happened
her
face
grew
set
in
its
lines
but
her
eyes
shone
with
the
devotion
of
a
martyr
as
she
answered
ah
no
for
my
mind
is
made
up
to
what
he
asked
gently
whilst
we
were
all
very
still
for
each
in
our
own
way
we
had
a
sort
of
vague
idea
of
what
she
meant
her
answer
came
with
direct
simplicity
as
though
she
were
simply
stating
a
fact
because
if
i
find
in
myselfand
i
shall
watch
keenly
for
ita
sign
of
harm
to
any
that
i
love
i
shall
die
you
would
not
kill
yourself
he
asked
hoarsely
i
would
if
there
were
no
friend
who
loved
me
who
would
save
me
such
a
pain
and
so
desperate
an
effort
she
looked
at
him
meaningly
as
she
spoke
he
was
sitting
down
but
now
he
rose
and
came
close
to
her
and
put
his
hand
on
her
head
as
he
said
solemnly
my
child
there
is
such
an
one
if
it
were
for
your
good
for
myself
i
could
hold
it
in
my
account
with
god
to
find
such
an
euthanasia
for
you
even
at
this
moment
if
it
were
best
nay
were
it
safe
but
my
child
for
a
moment
he
seemed
choked
and
a
great
sob
rose
in
his
throat
he
gulped
it
down
and
went
on
there
are
here
some
who
would
stand
between
you
and
death
you
must
not
die
you
must
not
die
by
any
hand
but
least
of
all
by
your
own
until
the
other
who
has
fouled
your
sweet
life
is
true
dead
you
must
not
die
for
if
he
is
still
with
the
quick
undead
your
death
would
make
you
even
as
he
is
no
you
must
live
you
must
struggle
and
strive
to
live
though
death
would
seem
a
boon
unspeakable
you
must
fight
death
himself
though
he
come
to
you
in
pain
or
in
joy
by
the
day
or
the
night
in
safety
or
in
peril
on
your
living
soul
i
charge
you
that
you
do
not
dienay
nor
think
of
deathtill
this
great
evil
be
past
the
poor
dear
grew
white
as
death
and
shock
and
shivered
as
i
have
seen
a
quicksand
shake
and
shiver
at
the
incoming
of
the
tide
we
were
all
silent
we
could
do
nothing
at
length
she
grew
more
calm
and
turning
to
him
said
sweetly
but
oh
so
sorrowfully
as
she
held
out
her
hand
i
promise
you
my
dear
friend
that
if
god
will
let
me
live
i
shall
strive
to
do
so
till
if
it
may
be
in
his
good
time
this
horror
may
have
passed
away
from
me
she
was
so
good
and
brave
that
we
all
felt
that
our
hearts
were
strengthened
to
work
and
endure
for
her
and
we
began
to
discuss
what
we
were
to
do
i
told
her
that
she
was
to
have
all
the
papers
in
the
safe
and
all
the
papers
or
diaries
and
phonographs
we
might
hereafter
use
and
was
to
keep
the
record
as
she
had
done
before
she
was
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
anything
to
doif
pleased
could
be
used
in
connection
with
so
grim
an
interest
as
usual
van
helsing
had
thought
ahead
of
everyone
else
and
was
prepared
with
an
exact
ordering
of
our
work
it
is
perhaps
well
he
said
that
at
our
meeting
after
our
visit
to
carfax
we
decided
not
to
do
anything
with
the
earthboxes
that
lay
there
had
we
done
so
the
count
must
have
guessed
our
purpose
and
would
doubtless
have
taken
measures
in
advance
to
frustrate
such
an
effort
with
regard
to
the
others
but
now
he
does
not
know
our
intentions
nay
more
in
all
probability
he
does
not
know
that
such
a
power
exists
to
us
as
can
sterilise
his
lairs
so
that
he
cannot
use
them
as
of
old
we
are
now
so
much
further
advanced
in
our
knowledge
as
to
their
disposition
that
when
we
have
examined
the
house
in
piccadilly
we
may
track
the
very
last
of
them
today
then
is
ours
and
in
it
rests
our
hope
the
sun
that
rose
on
our
sorrow
this
morning
guards
us
in
its
course
until
it
sets
tonight
that
monster
must
retain
whatever
form
he
now
has
he
is
confined
within
the
limitations
of
his
earthly
envelope
he
cannot
melt
into
thin
air
nor
disappear
through
cracks
or
chinks
or
crannies
if
he
go
through
a
doorway
he
must
open
the
door
like
a
mortal
and
so
we
have
this
day
to
hunt
out
all
his
lairs
and
sterilise
them
so
we
shall
if
we
have
not
yet
catch
him
and
destroy
him
drive
him
to
bay
in
some
place
where
the
catching
and
the
destroying
shall
be
in
time
sure
here
i
started
up
for
i
could
not
contain
myself
at
the
thought
that
the
minutes
and
seconds
so
preciously
laden
with
minas
life
and
happiness
were
flying
from
us
since
whilst
we
talked
action
was
impossible
but
van
helsing
held
up
his
hand
warningly
nay
friend
jonathan
he
said
in
this
the
quickest
way
home
is
the
longest
way
so
your
proverb
say
we
shall
all
act
and
act
with
desperate
quick
when
the
time
has
come
but
think
in
all
probable
the
key
of
the
situation
is
in
that
house
in
piccadilly
the
count
may
have
many
houses
which
he
has
bought
of
them
he
will
have
deeds
of
purchase
keys
and
other
things
he
will
have
paper
that
he
write
on
he
will
have
his
book
of
cheques
there
are
many
belongings
that
he
must
have
somewhere
why
not
in
this
place
so
central
so
quiet
where
he
come
and
go
by
the
front
or
the
back
at
all
hour
when
in
the
very
vast
of
the
traffic
there
is
none
to
notice
we
shall
go
there
and
search
that
house
and
when
we
learn
what
it
holds
then
we
do
what
our
friend
arthur
call
in
his
phrases
of
hunt
stop
the
earths
and
so
we
run
down
our
old
foxso
is
it
not
then
let
us
come
at
once
i
cried
we
are
wasting
the
precious
precious
time
the
professor
did
not
move
but
simply
said
and
how
are
we
to
get
into
that
house
in
piccadilly
any
way
i
cried
we
shall
break
in
if
need
be
and
your
police
where
will
they
be
and
what
will
they
say
i
was
staggered
but
i
knew
that
if
he
wished
to
delay
he
had
a
good
reason
for
it
so
i
said
as
quietly
as
i
could
dont
wait
more
than
need
be
you
know
i
am
sure
what
torture
i
am
in
ah
my
child
that
i
do
and
indeed
there
is
no
wish
of
me
to
add
to
your
anguish
but
just
think
what
can
we
do
until
all
the
world
be
at
movement
then
will
come
our
time
i
have
thought
and
thought
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
simplest
way
is
the
best
of
all
now
we
wish
to
get
into
the
house
but
we
have
no
key
is
it
not
so
i
nodded
now
suppose
that
you
were
in
truth
the
owner
of
that
house
and
could
not
still
get
in
and
think
there
was
to
you
no
conscience
of
the
housebreaker
what
would
you
do
i
should
get
a
respectable
locksmith
and
set
him
to
work
to
pick
the
lock
for
me
and
your
police
they
would
interfere
would
they
not
oh
no
not
if
they
knew
the
man
was
properly
employed
then
he
looked
at
me
as
keenly
as
he
spoke
all
that
is
in
doubt
is
the
conscience
of
the
employer
and
the
belief
of
your
policemen
as
to
whether
or
no
that
employer
has
a
good
conscience
or
a
bad
one
your
police
must
indeed
be
zealous
men
and
cleveroh
so
cleverin
reading
the
heart
that
they
trouble
themselves
in
such
matter
no
no
my
friend
jonathan
you
go
take
the
lock
off
a
hundred
empty
house
in
this
your
london
or
of
any
city
in
the
world
and
if
you
do
it
as
such
things
are
rightly
done
and
at
the
time
such
things
are
rightly
done
no
one
will
interfere
i
have
read
of
a
gentleman
who
owned
a
so
fine
house
in
london
and
when
he
went
for
months
of
summer
to
switzerland
and
lock
up
his
house
some
burglar
came
and
broke
window
at
back
and
got
in
then
he
went
and
made
open
the
shutters
in
front
and
walk
out
and
in
through
the
door
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
police
then
he
have
an
auction
in
that
house
and
advertise
it
and
put
up
big
notice
and
when
the
day
come
he
sell
off
by
a
great
auctioneer
all
the
goods
of
that
other
man
who
own
them
then
he
go
to
a
builder
and
he
sell
him
that
house
making
an
agreement
that
he
pull
it
down
and
take
all
away
within
a
certain
time
and
your
police
and
other
authority
help
him
all
they
can
and
when
that
owner
come
back
from
his
holiday
in
switzerland
he
find
only
an
empty
hole
where
his
house
had
been
this
was
all
done
en
rgle
and
in
our
work
we
shall
be
en
rgle
too
we
shall
not
go
so
early
that
the
policemen
who
have
then
little
to
think
of
shall
deem
it
strange
but
we
shall
go
after
ten
oclock
when
there
are
many
about
and
such
things
would
be
done
were
we
indeed
owners
of
the
house
i
could
not
but
see
how
right
he
was
and
the
terrible
despair
of
minas
face
became
relaxed
a
thought
there
was
hope
in
such
good
counsel
van
helsing
went
on
when
once
within
that
house
we
may
find
more
clues
at
any
rate
some
of
us
can
remain
there
whilst
the
rest
find
the
other
places
where
there
be
more
earthboxesat
bermondsey
and
mile
end
lord
godalming
stood
up
i
can
be
of
some
use
here
he
said
i
shall
wire
to
my
people
to
have
horses
and
carriages
where
they
will
be
most
convenient
look
here
old
fellow
said
morris
it
is
a
capital
idea
to
have
all
ready
in
case
we
want
to
go
horsebacking
but
dont
you
think
that
one
of
your
snappy
carriages
with
its
heraldic
adornments
in
a
byway
of
walworth
or
mile
end
would
attract
too
much
attention
for
our
purposes
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
take
cabs
when
we
go
south
or
east
and
even
leave
them
somewhere
near
the
neighbourhood
we
are
going
to
friend
quincey
is
right
said
the
professor
his
head
is
what
you
call
in
plane
with
the
horizon
it
is
a
difficult
thing
that
we
go
to
do
and
we
do
not
want
no
peoples
to
watch
us
if
so
it
may
mina
took
a
growing
interest
in
everything
and
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
the
exigency
of
affairs
was
helping
her
to
forget
for
a
time
the
terrible
experience
of
the
night
she
was
very
very
palealmost
ghastly
and
so
thin
that
her
lips
were
drawn
away
showing
her
teeth
in
somewhat
of
prominence
i
did
not
mention
this
last
lest
it
should
give
her
needless
pain
but
it
made
my
blood
run
cold
in
my
veins
to
think
of
what
had
occurred
with
poor
lucy
when
the
count
had
sucked
her
blood
as
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
the
teeth
growing
sharper
but
the
time
as
yet
was
short
and
there
was
time
for
fear
when
we
came
to
the
discussion
of
the
sequence
of
our
efforts
and
of
the
disposition
of
our
forces
there
were
new
sources
of
doubt
it
was
finally
agreed
that
before
starting
for
piccadilly
we
should
destroy
the
counts
lair
close
at
hand
in
case
he
should
find
it
out
too
soon
we
should
thus
be
still
ahead
of
him
in
our
work
of
destruction
and
his
presence
in
his
purely
material
shape
and
at
his
weakest
might
give
us
some
new
clue
as
to
the
disposal
of
forces
it
was
suggested
by
the
professor
that
after
our
visit
to
carfax
we
should
all
enter
the
house
in
piccadilly
that
the
two
doctors
and
i
should
remain
there
whilst
lord
godalming
and
quincey
found
the
lairs
at
walworth
and
mile
end
and
destroyed
them
it
was
possible
if
not
likely
the
professor
urged
that
the
count
might
appear
in
piccadilly
during
the
day
and
that
if
so
we
might
be
able
to
cope
with
him
then
and
there
at
any
rate
we
might
be
able
to
follow
him
in
force
to
this
plan
i
strenuously
objected
and
so
far
as
my
going
was
concerned
for
i
said
that
i
intended
to
stay
and
protect
mina
i
thought
that
my
mind
was
made
up
on
the
subject
but
mina
would
not
listen
to
my
objection
she
said
that
there
might
be
some
law
matter
in
which
i
could
be
useful
that
amongst
the
counts
papers
might
be
some
clue
which
i
could
understand
out
of
my
experience
in
transylvania
and
that
as
it
was
all
the
strength
we
could
muster
was
required
to
cope
with
the
counts
extraordinary
power
i
had
to
give
in
for
minas
resolution
was
fixed
she
said
that
it
was
the
last
hope
for
her
that
we
should
all
work
together
as
for
me
she
said
i
have
no
fear
things
have
been
as
bad
as
they
can
be
and
whatever
may
happen
must
have
in
it
some
element
of
hope
or
comfort
go
my
husband
god
can
if
he
wishes
it
guard
me
as
well
alone
as
with
any
one
present
so
i
started
up
crying
out
then
in
gods
name
let
us
come
at
once
for
we
are
losing
time
the
count
may
come
to
piccadilly
earlier
than
we
think
not
so
said
van
helsing
holding
up
his
hand
but
why
i
asked
do
you
forget
he
said
with
actually
a
smile
that
last
night
he
banqueted
heavily
and
will
sleep
late
did
i
forget
shall
i
evercan
i
ever
can
any
of
us
ever
forget
that
terrible
scene
mina
struggled
hard
to
keep
her
brave
countenance
but
the
pain
overmastered
her
and
she
put
her
hands
before
her
face
and
shuddered
whilst
she
moaned
van
helsing
had
not
intended
to
recall
her
frightful
experience
he
had
simply
lost
sight
of
her
and
her
part
in
the
affair
in
his
intellectual
effort
when
it
struck
him
what
he
said
he
was
horrified
at
his
thoughtlessness
and
tried
to
comfort
her
oh
madam
mina
he
said
dear
dear
madam
mina
alas
that
i
of
all
who
so
reverence
you
should
have
said
anything
so
forgetful
these
stupid
old
lips
of
mine
and
this
stupid
old
head
do
not
deserve
so
but
you
will
forget
it
will
you
not
he
bent
low
beside
her
as
he
spoke
she
took
his
hand
and
looking
at
him
through
her
tears
said
hoarsely
no
i
shall
not
forget
for
it
is
well
that
i
remember
and
with
it
i
have
so
much
in
memory
of
you
that
is
sweet
that
i
take
it
all
together
now
you
must
all
be
going
soon
breakfast
is
ready
and
we
must
all
eat
that
we
may
be
strong
breakfast
was
a
strange
meal
to
us
all
we
tried
to
be
cheerful
and
encourage
each
other
and
mina
was
the
brightest
and
most
cheerful
of
us
when
it
was
over
van
helsing
stood
up
and
said
now
my
dear
friends
we
go
forth
to
our
terrible
enterprise
are
we
all
armed
as
we
were
on
that
night
when
first
we
visited
our
enemys
lair
armed
against
ghostly
as
well
as
carnal
attack
we
all
assured
him
then
it
is
well
now
madam
mina
you
are
in
any
case
quite
safe
here
until
the
sunset
and
before
then
we
shall
returnif
we
shall
return
but
before
we
go
let
me
see
you
armed
against
personal
attack
i
have
myself
since
you
came
down
prepared
your
chamber
by
the
placing
of
things
of
which
we
know
so
that
he
may
not
enter
now
let
me
guard
yourself
on
your
forehead
i
touch
this
piece
of
sacred
wafer
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
there
was
a
fearful
scream
which
almost
froze
our
hearts
to
hear
as
he
had
placed
the
wafer
on
minas
forehead
it
had
seared
ithad
burned
into
the
flesh
as
though
it
had
been
a
piece
of
whitehot
metal
my
poor
darlings
brain
had
told
her
the
significance
of
the
fact
as
quickly
as
her
nerves
received
the
pain
of
it
and
the
two
so
overwhelmed
her
that
her
overwrought
nature
had
its
voice
in
that
dreadful
scream
but
the
words
to
her
thought
came
quickly
the
echo
of
the
scream
had
not
ceased
to
ring
on
the
air
when
there
came
the
reaction
and
she
sank
on
her
knees
on
the
floor
in
an
agony
of
abasement
pulling
her
beautiful
hair
over
her
face
as
the
leper
of
old
his
mantle
she
wailed
out
unclean
unclean
even
the
almighty
shuns
my
polluted
flesh
i
must
bear
this
mark
of
shame
upon
my
forehead
until
the
judgment
day
they
all
paused
i
had
thrown
myself
beside
her
in
an
agony
of
helpless
grief
and
putting
my
arms
around
held
her
tight
for
a
few
minutes
our
sorrowful
hearts
beat
together
whilst
the
friends
around
us
turned
away
their
eyes
that
ran
tears
silently
then
van
helsing
turned
and
said
gravely
so
gravely
that
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
in
some
way
inspired
and
was
stating
things
outside
himself
it
may
be
that
you
may
have
to
bear
that
mark
till
god
himself
see
fit
as
he
most
surely
shall
on
the
judgment
day
to
redress
all
wrongs
of
the
earth
and
of
his
children
that
he
has
placed
thereon
and
oh
madam
mina
my
dear
my
dear
may
we
who
love
you
be
there
to
see
when
that
red
scar
the
sign
of
gods
knowledge
of
what
has
been
shall
pass
away
and
leave
your
forehead
as
pure
as
the
heart
we
know
for
so
surely
as
we
live
that
scar
shall
pass
away
when
god
sees
right
to
lift
the
burden
that
is
hard
upon
us
till
then
we
bear
our
cross
as
his
son
did
in
obedience
to
his
will
it
may
be
that
we
are
chosen
instruments
of
his
good
pleasure
and
that
we
ascend
to
his
bidding
as
that
other
through
stripes
and
shame
through
tears
and
blood
through
doubts
and
fears
and
all
that
makes
the
difference
between
god
and
man
there
was
hope
in
his
words
and
comfort
and
they
made
for
resignation
mina
and
i
both
felt
so
and
simultaneously
we
each
took
one
of
the
old
mans
hands
and
bent
over
and
kissed
it
then
without
a
word
we
all
knelt
down
together
and
all
holding
hands
swore
to
be
true
to
each
other
we
men
pledged
ourselves
to
raise
the
veil
of
sorrow
from
the
head
of
her
whom
each
in
his
own
way
we
loved
and
we
prayed
for
help
and
guidance
in
the
terrible
task
which
lay
before
us
it
was
then
time
to
start
so
i
said
farewell
to
mina
a
parting
which
neither
of
us
shall
forget
to
our
dying
day
and
we
set
out
to
one
thing
i
have
made
up
my
mind
if
we
find
out
that
mina
must
be
a
vampire
in
the
end
then
she
shall
not
go
into
that
unknown
and
terrible
land
alone
i
suppose
it
is
thus
that
in
old
times
one
vampire
meant
many
just
as
their
hideous
bodies
could
only
rest
in
sacred
earth
so
the
holiest
love
was
the
recruiting
sergeant
for
their
ghastly
ranks
we
entered
carfax
without
trouble
and
found
all
things
the
same
as
on
the
first
occasion
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
amongst
so
prosaic
surroundings
of
neglect
and
dust
and
decay
there
was
any
ground
for
such
fear
as
already
we
knew
had
not
our
minds
been
made
up
and
had
there
not
been
terrible
memories
to
spur
us
on
we
could
hardly
have
proceeded
with
our
task
we
found
no
papers
or
any
sign
of
use
in
the
house
and
in
the
old
chapel
the
great
boxes
looked
just
as
we
had
seen
them
last
dr
van
helsing
said
to
us
solemnly
as
we
stood
before
them
and
now
my
friends
we
have
a
duty
here
to
do
we
must
sterilise
this
earth
so
sacred
of
holy
memories
that
he
has
brought
from
a
far
distant
land
for
such
fell
use
he
has
chosen
this
earth
because
it
has
been
holy
thus
we
defeat
him
with
his
own
weapon
for
we
make
it
more
holy
still
it
was
sanctified
to
such
use
of
man
now
we
sanctify
it
to
god
as
he
spoke
he
took
from
his
bag
a
screwdriver
and
a
wrench
and
very
soon
the
top
of
one
of
the
cases
was
thrown
open
the
earth
smelled
musty
and
close
but
we
did
not
somehow
seem
to
mind
for
our
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
professor
taking
from
his
box
a
piece
of
the
sacred
wafer
he
laid
it
reverently
on
the
earth
and
then
shutting
down
the
lid
began
to
screw
it
home
we
aiding
him
as
he
worked
one
by
one
we
treated
in
the
same
way
each
of
the
great
boxes
and
left
them
as
we
had
found
them
to
all
appearance
but
in
each
was
a
portion
of
the
host
when
we
closed
the
door
behind
us
the
professor
said
solemnly
so
much
is
already
done
if
it
may
be
that
with
all
the
others
we
can
be
so
successful
then
the
sunset
of
this
evening
may
shine
on
madam
minas
forehead
all
white
as
ivory
and
with
no
stain
as
we
passed
across
the
lawn
on
our
way
to
the
station
to
catch
our
train
we
could
see
the
front
of
the
asylum
i
looked
eagerly
and
in
the
window
of
my
own
room
saw
mina
i
waved
my
hand
to
her
and
nodded
to
tell
that
our
work
there
was
successfully
accomplished
she
nodded
in
reply
to
show
that
she
understood
the
last
i
saw
she
was
waving
her
hand
in
farewell
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
we
sought
the
station
and
just
caught
the
train
which
was
steaming
in
as
we
reached
the
platform
i
have
written
this
in
the
train





piccadilly
1230
oclockjust
before
we
reached
fenchurch
street
lord
godalming
said
to
me
quincey
and
i
will
find
a
locksmith
you
had
better
not
come
with
us
in
case
there
should
be
any
difficulty
for
under
the
circumstances
it
wouldnt
seem
so
bad
for
us
to
break
into
an
empty
house
but
you
are
a
solicitor
and
the
incorporated
law
society
might
tell
you
that
you
should
have
known
better
i
demurred
as
to
my
not
sharing
any
danger
even
of
odium
but
he
went
on
besides
it
will
attract
less
attention
if
there
are
not
too
many
of
us
my
title
will
make
it
all
right
with
the
locksmith
and
with
any
policeman
that
may
come
along
you
had
better
go
with
jack
and
the
professor
and
stay
in
the
green
park
somewhere
in
sight
of
the
house
and
when
you
see
the
door
opened
and
the
smith
has
gone
away
do
you
all
come
across
we
shall
be
on
the
lookout
for
you
and
shall
let
you
in
the
advice
is
good
said
van
helsing
so
we
said
no
more
godalming
and
morris
hurried
off
in
a
cab
we
following
in
another
at
the
corner
of
arlington
street
our
contingent
got
out
and
strolled
into
the
green
park
my
heart
beat
as
i
saw
the
house
on
which
so
much
of
our
hope
was
centred
looming
up
grim
and
silent
in
its
deserted
condition
amongst
its
more
lively
and
sprucelooking
neighbours
we
sat
down
on
a
bench
within
good
view
and
began
to
smoke
cigars
so
as
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
the
minutes
seemed
to
pass
with
leaden
feet
as
we
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
others
at
length
we
saw
a
fourwheeler
drive
up
out
of
it
in
leisurely
fashion
got
lord
godalming
and
morris
and
down
from
the
box
descended
a
thickset
working
man
with
his
rushwoven
basket
of
tools
morris
paid
the
cabman
who
touched
his
hat
and
drove
away
together
the
two
ascended
the
steps
and
lord
godalming
pointed
out
what
he
wanted
done
the
workman
took
off
his
coat
leisurely
and
hung
it
on
one
of
the
spikes
of
the
rail
saying
something
to
a
policeman
who
just
then
sauntered
along
the
policeman
nodded
acquiescence
and
the
man
kneeling
down
placed
his
bag
beside
him
after
searching
through
it
he
took
out
a
selection
of
tools
which
he
produced
to
lay
beside
him
in
orderly
fashion
then
he
stood
up
looked
into
the
keyhole
blew
into
it
and
turning
to
his
employers
made
some
remark
lord
godalming
smiled
and
the
man
lifted
a
goodsized
bunch
of
keys
selecting
one
of
them
he
began
to
probe
the
lock
as
if
feeling
his
way
with
it
after
fumbling
about
for
a
bit
he
tried
a
second
and
then
a
third
all
at
once
the
door
opened
under
a
slight
push
from
him
and
he
and
the
two
others
entered
the
hall
we
sat
still
my
own
cigar
burnt
furiously
but
van
helsings
went
cold
altogether
we
waited
patiently
as
we
saw
the
workman
come
out
and
bring
in
his
bag
then
he
held
the
door
partly
open
steadying
it
with
his
knees
whilst
he
fitted
a
key
to
the
lock
this
he
finally
handed
to
lord
godalming
who
took
out
his
purse
and
gave
him
something
the
man
touched
his
hat
took
his
bag
put
on
his
coat
and
departed
not
a
soul
took
the
slightest
notice
of
the
whole
transaction
when
the
man
had
fairly
gone
we
three
crossed
the
street
and
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
immediately
opened
by
quincey
morris
beside
whom
stood
lord
godalming
lighting
a
cigar
the
place
smells
so
vilely
said
the
latter
as
we
came
in
it
did
indeed
smell
vilelylike
the
old
chapel
at
carfaxand
with
our
previous
experience
it
was
plain
to
us
that
the
count
had
been
using
the
place
pretty
freely
we
moved
to
explore
the
house
all
keeping
together
in
case
of
attack
for
we
knew
we
had
a
strong
and
wily
enemy
to
deal
with
and
as
yet
we
did
not
know
whether
the
count
might
not
be
in
the
house
in
the
diningroom
which
lay
at
the
back
of
the
hall
we
found
eight
boxes
of
earth
eight
boxes
only
out
of
the
nine
which
we
sought
our
work
was
not
over
and
would
never
be
until
we
should
have
found
the
missing
box
first
we
opened
the
shutters
of
the
window
which
looked
out
across
a
narrow
stoneflagged
yard
at
the
blank
face
of
a
stable
pointed
to
look
like
the
front
of
a
miniature
house
there
were
no
windows
in
it
so
we
were
not
afraid
of
being
overlooked
we
did
not
lose
any
time
in
examining
the
chests
with
the
tools
which
we
had
brought
with
us
we
opened
them
one
by
one
and
treated
them
as
we
had
treated
those
others
in
the
old
chapel
it
was
evident
to
us
that
the
count
was
not
at
present
in
the
house
and
we
proceeded
to
search
for
any
of
his
effects
after
a
cursory
glance
at
the
rest
of
the
rooms
from
basement
to
attic
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
diningroom
contained
any
effects
which
might
belong
to
the
count
and
so
we
proceeded
to
minutely
examine
them
they
lay
in
a
sort
of
orderly
disorder
on
the
great
diningroom
table
there
were
title
deeds
of
the
piccadilly
house
in
a
great
bundle
deeds
of
the
purchase
of
the
houses
at
mile
end
and
bermondsey
notepaper
envelopes
and
pens
and
ink
all
were
covered
up
in
thin
wrapping
paper
to
keep
them
from
the
dust
there
were
also
a
clothes
brush
a
brush
and
comb
and
a
jug
and
basinthe
latter
containing
dirty
water
which
was
reddened
as
if
with
blood
last
of
all
was
a
little
heap
of
keys
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
probably
those
belonging
to
the
other
houses
when
we
had
examined
this
last
find
lord
godalming
and
quincey
morris
taking
accurate
notes
of
the
various
addresses
of
the
houses
in
the
east
and
the
south
took
with
them
the
keys
in
a
great
bunch
and
set
out
to
destroy
the

octoberthe
time
seemed
terribly
long
whilst
we
were
waiting
for
the
coming
of
godalming
and
quincey
morris
the
professor
tried
to
keep
our
minds
active
by
using
them
all
the
time
i
could
see
his
beneficent
purpose
by
the
side
glances
which
he
threw
from
time
to
time
at
harker
the
poor
fellow
is
overwhelmed
in
a
misery
that
is
appalling
to
see
last
night
he
was
a
frank
happylooking
man
with
strong
youthful
face
full
of
energy
and
with
dark
brown
hair
today
he
is
a
drawn
haggard
old
man
whose
white
hair
matches
well
with
the
hollow
burning
eyes
and
griefwritten
lines
of
his
face
his
energy
is
still
intact
in
fact
he
is
like
a
living
flame
this
may
yet
be
his
salvation
for
if
all
go
well
it
will
tide
him
over
the
despairing
period
he
will
then
in
a
kind
of
way
wake
again
to
the
realities
of
life
poor
fellow
i
thought
my
own
trouble
was
bad
enough
but
his
the
professor
knows
this
well
enough
and
is
doing
his
best
to
keep
his
mind
active
what
he
has
been
saying
was
under
the
circumstances
of
absorbing
interest
so
well
as
i
can
remember
here
it
is
i
have
studied
over
and
over
again
since
they
came
into
my
hands
all
the
papers
relating
to
this
monster
and
the
more
i
have
studied
the
greater
seems
the
necessity
to
utterly
stamp
him
out
all
through
there
are
signs
of
his
advance
not
only
of
his
power
but
of
his
knowledge
of
it
as
i
learned
from
the
researches
of
my
friend
arminus
of
budapesth
he
was
in
life
a
most
wonderful
man
soldier
statesman
and
alchemistwhich
latter
was
the
highest
development
of
the
scienceknowledge
of
his
time
he
had
a
mighty
brain
a
learning
beyond
compare
and
a
heart
that
knew
no
fear
and
no
remorse
he
dared
even
to
attend
the
scholomance
and
there
was
no
branch
of
knowledge
of
his
time
that
he
did
not
essay
well
in
him
the
brain
powers
survived
the
physical
death
though
it
would
seem
that
memory
was
not
all
complete
in
some
faculties
of
mind
he
has
been
and
is
only
a
child
but
he
is
growing
and
some
things
that
were
childish
at
the
first
are
now
of
mans
stature
he
is
experimenting
and
doing
it
well
and
if
it
had
not
been
that
we
have
crossed
his
path
he
would
be
yethe
may
be
yet
if
we
failthe
father
or
furtherer
of
a
new
order
of
beings
whose
road
must
lead
through
death
not
life
harker
groaned
and
said
and
this
is
all
arrayed
against
my
darling
but
how
is
he
experimenting
the
knowledge
may
help
us
to
defeat
him
he
has
all
along
since
his
coming
been
trying
his
power
slowly
but
surely
that
big
childbrain
of
his
is
working
well
for
us
it
is
as
yet
a
childbrain
for
had
he
dared
at
the
first
to
attempt
certain
things
he
would
long
ago
have
been
beyond
our
power
however
he
means
to
succeed
and
a
man
who
has
centuries
before
him
can
afford
to
wait
and
to
go
slow
festina
lente
may
well
be
his
motto
i
fail
to
understand
said
harker
wearily
oh
do
be
more
plain
to
me
perhaps
grief
and
trouble
are
dulling
my
brain
the
professor
laid
his
hand
tenderly
on
his
shoulder
as
he
spoke
ah
my
child
i
will
be
plain
do
you
not
see
how
of
late
this
monster
has
been
creeping
into
knowledge
experimentally
how
he
has
been
making
use
of
the
zophagous
patient
to
effect
his
entry
into
friend
johns
home
for
your
vampire
though
in
all
afterwards
he
can
come
when
and
how
he
will
must
at
the
first
make
entry
only
when
asked
thereto
by
an
inmate
but
these
are
not
his
most
important
experiments
do
we
not
see
how
at
the
first
all
these
so
great
boxes
were
moved
by
others
he
knew
not
then
but
that
must
be
so
but
all
the
time
that
so
great
childbrain
of
his
was
growing
and
he
began
to
consider
whether
he
might
not
himself
move
the
box
so
he
began
to
help
and
then
when
he
found
that
this
be
allright
he
try
to
move
them
all
alone
and
so
he
progress
and
he
scatter
these
graves
of
him
and
none
but
he
know
where
they
are
hidden
he
may
have
intend
to
bury
them
deep
in
the
ground
so
that
he
only
use
them
in
the
night
or
at
such
time
as
he
can
change
his
form
they
do
him
equal
well
and
none
may
know
these
are
his
hidingplace
but
my
child
do
not
despair
this
knowledge
come
to
him
just
too
late
already
all
of
his
lairs
but
one
be
sterilise
as
for
him
and
before
the
sunset
this
shall
be
so
then
he
have
no
place
where
he
can
move
and
hide
i
delayed
this
morning
that
so
we
might
be
sure
is
there
not
more
at
stake
for
us
than
for
him
then
why
we
not
be
even
more
careful
than
him
by
my
clock
it
is
one
hour
and
already
if
all
be
well
friend
arthur
and
quincey
are
on
their
way
to
us
today
is
our
day
and
we
must
go
sure
if
slow
and
lose
no
chance
see
there
are
five
of
us
when
those
absent
ones
return
whilst
he
was
speaking
we
were
startled
by
a
knock
at
the
hall
door
the
double
postmans
knock
of
the
telegraph
boy
we
all
moved
out
to
the
hall
with
one
impulse
and
van
helsing
holding
up
his
hand
to
us
to
keep
silence
stepped
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
boy
handed
in
a
despatch
the
professor
closed
the
door
again
and
after
looking
at
the
direction
opened
it
and
read
aloud
look
out
for
d
he
has
just
now
1245
come
from
carfax
hurriedly
and
hastened
towards
the
south
he
seems
to
be
going
the
round
and
may
want
to
see
you
mina
there
was
a
pause
broken
by
jonathan
harkers
voice
now
god
be
thanked
we
shall
soon
meet
van
helsing
turned
to
him
quickly
and
said
god
will
act
in
his
own
way
and
time
do
not
fear
and
do
not
rejoice
as
yet
for
what
we
wish
for
at
the
moment
may
be
our
undoings
i
care
for
nothing
now
he
answered
hotly
except
to
wipe
out
this
brute
from
the
face
of
creation
i
would
sell
my
soul
to
do
it
oh
hush
hush
my
child
said
van
helsing
god
does
not
purchase
souls
in
this
wise
and
the
devil
though
he
may
purchase
does
not
keep
faith
but
god
is
merciful
and
just
and
knows
your
pain
and
your
devotion
to
that
dear
madam
mina
think
you
how
her
pain
would
be
doubled
did
she
but
hear
your
wild
words
do
not
fear
any
of
us
we
are
all
devoted
to
this
cause
and
today
shall
see
the
end
the
time
is
coming
for
action
today
this
vampire
is
limit
to
the
powers
of
man
and
till
sunset
he
may
not
change
it
will
take
him
time
to
arrive
heresee
it
is
twenty
minutes
past
oneand
there
are
yet
some
times
before
he
can
hither
come
be
he
never
so
quick
what
we
must
hope
for
is
that
my
lord
arthur
and
quincey
arrive
first
about
half
an
hour
after
we
had
received
mrs
harkers
telegram
there
came
a
quiet
resolute
knock
at
the
hall
door
it
was
just
an
ordinary
knock
such
as
is
given
hourly
by
thousands
of
gentlemen
but
it
made
the
professors
heart
and
mine
beat
loudly
we
looked
at
each
other
and
together
moved
out
into
the
hall
we
each
held
ready
to
use
our
various
armamentsthe
spiritual
in
the
left
hand
the
mortal
in
the
right
van
helsing
pulled
back
the
latch
and
holding
the
door
half
open
stood
back
having
both
hands
ready
for
action
the
gladness
of
our
hearts
must
have
shown
upon
our
faces
when
on
the
step
close
to
the
door
we
saw
lord
godalming
and
quincey
morris
they
came
quickly
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
the
former
saying
as
they
moved
along
the
hall
it
is
all
right
we
found
both
places
six
boxes
in
each
and
we
destroyed
them
all
destroyed
asked
the
professor
for
him
we
were
silent
for
a
minute
and
then
quincey
said
theres
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
here
if
however
he
doesnt
turn
up
by
five
oclock
we
must
start
off
for
it
wont
do
to
leave
mrs
harker
alone
after
sunset
he
will
be
here
before
long
now
said
van
helsing
who
had
been
consulting
his
pocketbook
nota
bene
in
madams
telegram
he
went
south
from
carfax
that
means
he
went
to
cross
the
river
and
he
could
only
do
so
at
slack
of
tide
which
should
be
something
before
one
oclock
that
he
went
south
has
a
meaning
for
us
he
is
as
yet
only
suspicious
and
he
went
from
carfax
first
to
the
place
where
he
would
suspect
interference
least
you
must
have
been
at
bermondsey
only
a
short
time
before
him
that
he
is
not
here
already
shows
that
he
went
to
mile
end
next
this
took
him
some
time
for
he
would
then
have
to
be
carried
over
the
river
in
some
way
believe
me
my
friends
we
shall
not
have
long
to
wait
now
we
should
have
ready
some
plan
of
attack
so
that
we
may
throw
away
no
chance
hush
there
is
no
time
now
have
all
your
arms
be
ready
he
held
up
a
warning
hand
as
he
spoke
for
we
all
could
hear
a
key
softly
inserted
in
the
lock
of
the
hall
door
i
could
not
but
admire
even
at
such
a
moment
the
way
in
which
a
dominant
spirit
asserted
itself
in
all
our
hunting
parties
and
adventures
in
different
parts
of
the
world
quincey
morris
had
always
been
the
one
to
arrange
the
plan
of
action
and
arthur
and
i
had
been
accustomed
to
obey
him
implicitly
now
the
old
habit
seemed
to
be
renewed
instinctively
with
a
swift
glance
around
the
room
he
at
once
laid
out
our
plan
of
attack
and
without
speaking
a
word
with
a
gesture
placed
us
each
in
position
van
helsing
harker
and
i
were
just
behind
the
door
so
that
when
it
was
opened
the
professor
could
guard
it
whilst
we
two
stepped
between
the
incomer
and
the
door
godalming
behind
and
quincey
in
front
stood
just
out
of
sight
ready
to
move
in
front
of
the
window
we
waited
in
a
suspense
that
made
the
seconds
pass
with
nightmare
slowness
the
slow
careful
steps
came
along
the
hall
the
count
was
evidently
prepared
for
some
surpriseat
least
he
feared
it
suddenly
with
a
single
bound
he
leaped
into
the
room
winning
a
way
past
us
before
any
of
us
could
raise
a
hand
to
stay
him
there
was
something
so
pantherlike
in
the
movementsomething
so
unhuman
that
it
seemed
to
sober
us
all
from
the
shock
of
his
coming
the
first
to
act
was
harker
who
with
a
quick
movement
threw
himself
before
the
door
leading
into
the
room
in
the
front
of
the
house
as
the
count
saw
us
a
horrible
sort
of
snarl
passed
over
his
face
showing
the
eyeteeth
long
and
pointed
but
the
evil
smile
as
quickly
passed
into
a
cold
stare
of
lionlike
disdain
his
expression
again
changed
as
with
a
single
impulse
we
all
advanced
upon
him
it
was
a
pity
that
we
had
not
some
better
organised
plan
of
attack
for
even
at
the
moment
i
wondered
what
we
were
to
do
i
did
not
myself
know
whether
our
lethal
weapons
would
avail
us
anything
harker
evidently
meant
to
try
the
matter
for
he
had
ready
his
great
kukri
knife
and
made
a
fierce
and
sudden
cut
at
him
the
blow
was
a
powerful
one
only
the
diabolical
quickness
of
the
counts
leap
back
saved
him
a
second
less
and
the
trenchant
blade
had
shorne
through
his
heart
as
it
was
the
point
just
cut
the
cloth
of
his
coat
making
a
wide
gap
whence
a
bundle
of
banknotes
and
a
stream
of
gold
fell
out
the
expression
of
the
counts
face
was
so
hellish
that
for
a
moment
i
feared
for
harker
though
i
saw
him
throw
the
terrible
knife
aloft
again
for
another
stroke
instinctively
i
moved
forward
with
a
protective
impulse
holding
the
crucifix
and
wafer
in
my
left
hand
i
felt
a
mighty
power
fly
along
my
arm
and
it
was
without
surprise
that
i
saw
the
monster
cower
back
before
a
similar
movement
made
spontaneously
by
each
one
of
us
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
expression
of
hate
and
baffled
malignityof
anger
and
hellish
ragewhich
came
over
the
counts
face
his
waxen
hue
became
greenishyellow
by
the
contrast
of
his
burning
eyes
and
the
red
scar
on
the
forehead
showed
on
the
pallid
skin
like
a
palpitating
wound
the
next
instant
with
a
sinuous
dive
he
swept
under
harkers
arm
ere
his
blow
could
fall
and
grasping
a
handful
of
the
money
from
the
floor
dashed
across
the
room
threw
himself
at
the
window
amid
the
crash
and
glitter
of
the
falling
glass
he
tumbled
into
the
flagged
area
below
through
the
sound
of
the
shivering
glass
i
could
hear
the
ting
of
the
gold
as
some
of
the
sovereigns
fell
on
the
flagging
we
ran
over
and
saw
him
spring
unhurt
from
the
ground
he
rushing
up
the
steps
crossed
the
flagged
yard
and
pushed
open
the
stable
door
there
he
turned
and
spoke
to
us
you
think
to
baffle
me
youwith
your
pale
faces
all
in
a
row
like
sheep
in
a
butchers
you
shall
be
sorry
yet
each
one
of
you
you
think
you
have
left
me
without
a
place
to
rest
but
i
have
more
my
revenge
is
just
begun
i
spread
it
over
centuries
and
time
is
on
my
side
your
girls
that
you
all
love
are
mine
already
and
through
them
you
and
others
shall
yet
be
minemy
creatures
to
do
my
bidding
and
to
be
my
jackals
when
i
want
to
feed
bah
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
he
passed
quickly
through
the
door
and
we
heard
the
rusty
bolt
creak
as
he
fastened
it
behind
him
a
door
beyond
opened
and
shut
the
first
of
us
to
speak
was
the
professor
as
realising
the
difficulty
of
following
him
through
the
stable
we
moved
toward
the
hall
we
have
learnt
somethingmuch
notwithstanding
his
brave
words
he
fears
us
he
fear
time
he
fear
want
for
if
not
why
he
hurry
so
his
very
tone
betray
him
or
my
ears
deceive
why
take
that
money
you
follow
quick
you
are
hunters
of
wild
beast
and
understand
it
so
for
me
i
make
sure
that
nothing
here
may
be
of
use
to
him
if
so
that
he
return
as
he
spoke
he
put
the
money
remaining
into
his
pocket
took
the
titledeeds
in
the
bundle
as
harker
had
left
them
and
swept
the
remaining
things
into
the
open
fireplace
where
he
set
fire
to
them
with
a
match
godalming
and
morris
had
rushed
out
into
the
yard
and
harker
had
lowered
himself
from
the
window
to
follow
the
count
he
had
however
bolted
the
stable
door
and
by
the
time
they
had
forced
it
open
there
was
no
sign
of
him
van
helsing
and
i
tried
to
make
inquiry
at
the
back
of
the
house
but
the
mews
was
deserted
and
no
one
had
seen
him
depart
it
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
and
sunset
was
not
far
off
we
had
to
recognise
that
our
game
was
up
with
heavy
hearts
we
agreed
with
the
professor
when
he
said
let
us
go
back
to
madam
minapoor
poor
dear
madam
mina
all
we
can
do
just
now
is
done
and
we
can
there
at
least
protect
her
but
we
need
not
despair
there
is
but
one
more
earthbox
and
we
must
try
to
find
it
when
that
is
done
all
may
yet
be
well
i
could
see
that
he
spoke
as
bravely
as
he
could
to
comfort
harker
the
poor
fellow
was
quite
broken
down
now
and
again
he
gave
a
low
groan
which
he
could
not
suppresshe
was
thinking
of
his
wife
with
sad
hearts
we
came
back
to
my
house
where
we
found
mrs
harker
waiting
us
with
an
appearance
of
cheerfulness
which
did
honour
to
her
bravery
and
unselfishness
when
she
saw
our
faces
her
own
became
as
pale
as
death
for
a
second
or
two
her
eyes
were
closed
as
if
she
were
in
secret
prayer
and
then
she
said
cheerfully
i
can
never
thank
you
all
enough
oh
my
poor
darling
as
she
spoke
she
took
her
husbands
grey
head
in
her
hands
and
kissed
itlay
your
poor
head
here
and
rest
it
all
will
yet
be
well
dear
god
will
protect
us
if
he
so
will
it
in
his
good
intent
the
poor
fellow
groaned
there
was
no
place
for
words
in
his
sublime
misery
we
had
a
sort
of
perfunctory
supper
together
and
i
think
it
cheered
us
all
up
somewhat
it
was
perhaps
the
mere
animal
heat
of
food
to
hungry
peoplefor
none
of
us
had
eaten
anything
since
breakfastor
the
sense
of
companionship
may
have
helped
us
but
anyhow
we
were
all
less
miserable
and
saw
the
morrow
as
not
altogether
without
hope
true
to
our
promise
we
told
mrs
harker
everything
which
had
passed
and
although
she
grew
snowy
white
at
times
when
danger
had
seemed
to
threaten
her
husband
and
red
at
others
when
his
devotion
to
her
was
manifested
she
listened
bravely
and
with
calmness
when
we
came
to
the
part
where
harker
had
rushed
at
the
count
so
recklessly
she
clung
to
her
husbands
arm
and
held
it
tight
as
though
her
clinging
could
protect
him
from
any
harm
that
might
come
she
said
nothing
however
till
the
narration
was
all
done
and
matters
had
been
brought
right
up
to
the
present
time
then
without
letting
go
her
husbands
hand
she
stood
up
amongst
us
and
spoke
oh
that
i
could
give
any
idea
of
the
scene
of
that
sweet
sweet
good
good
woman
in
all
the
radiant
beauty
of
her
youth
and
animation
with
the
red
scar
on
her
forehead
of
which
she
was
conscious
and
which
we
saw
with
grinding
of
our
teethremembering
whence
and
how
it
came
her
loving
kindness
against
our
grim
hate
her
tender
faith
against
all
our
fears
and
doubting
and
we
knowing
that
so
far
as
symbols
went
she
with
all
her
goodness
and
purity
and
faith
was
outcast
from
god
jonathan
she
said
and
the
word
sounded
like
music
on
her
lips
it
was
so
full
of
love
and
tenderness
jonathan
dear
and
you
all
my
true
true
friends
i
want
you
to
bear
something
in
mind
through
all
this
dreadful
time
i
know
that
you
must
fightthat
you
must
destroy
even
as
you
destroyed
the
false
lucy
so
that
the
true
lucy
might
live
hereafter
but
it
is
not
a
work
of
hate
that
poor
soul
who
has
wrought
all
this
misery
is
the
saddest
case
of
all
just
think
what
will
be
his
joy
when
he
too
is
destroyed
in
his
worser
part
that
his
better
part
may
have
spiritual
immortality
you
must
be
pitiful
to
him
too
though
it
may
not
hold
your
hands
from
his
destruction
as
she
spoke
i
could
see
her
husbands
face
darken
and
draw
together
as
though
the
passion
in
him
were
shrivelling
his
being
to
its
core
instinctively
the
clasp
on
his
wifes
hand
grew
closer
till
his
knuckles
looked
white
she
did
not
flinch
from
the
pain
which
i
knew
she
must
have
suffered
but
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
more
appealing
than
ever
as
she
stopped
speaking
he
leaped
to
his
feet
almost
tearing
his
hand
from
hers
as
he
spoke
may
god
give
him
into
my
hand
just
for
long
enough
to
destroy
that
earthly
life
of
him
which
we
are
aiming
at
if
beyond
it
i
could
send
his
soul
for
ever
and
ever
to
burning
hell
i
would
do
it
oh
hush
oh
hush
in
the
name
of
the
good
god
dont
say
such
things
jonathan
my
husband
or
you
will
crush
me
with
fear
and
horror
just
think
my
deari
have
been
thinking
all
this
long
long
day
of
itthat

perhaps

some
day

i
too
may
need
such
pity
and
that
some
other
like
youand
with
equal
cause
for
angermay
deny
it
to
me
oh
my
husband
my
husband
indeed
i
would
have
spared
you
such
a
thought
had
there
been
another
way
but
i
pray
that
god
may
not
have
treasured
your
wild
words
except
as
the
heartbroken
wail
of
a
very
loving
and
sorely
stricken
man
oh
god
let
these
poor
white
hairs
go
in
evidence
of
what
he
has
suffered
who
all
his
life
has
done
no
wrong
and
on
whom
so
many
sorrows
have
come
we
men
were
all
in
tears
now
there
was
no
resisting
them
and
we
wept
openly
she
wept
too
to
see
that
her
sweeter
counsels
had
prevailed
her
husband
flung
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
putting
his
arms
round
her
hid
his
face
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
van
helsing
beckoned
to
us
and
we
stole
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
two
loving
hearts
alone
with
their
god
before
they
retired
the
professor
fixed
up
the
room
against
any
coming
of
the
vampire
and
assured
mrs
harker
that
she
might
rest
in
peace
she
tried
to
school
herself
to
the
belief
and
manifestly
for
her
husbands
sake
tried
to
seem
content
it
was
a
brave
struggle
and
was
i
think
and

not

its
reward

journal
34
october
close
to
midnighti
thought
yesterday
would
never
end
there
was
over
me
a
yearning
for
sleep
in
some
sort
of
blind
belief
that
to
wake
would
be
to
find
things
changed
and
that
any
change
must
now
be
for
the
better
before
we
parted
we
discussed
what
our
next
step
was
to
be
but
we
could
arrive
at
no
result
all
we
knew
was
that
one
earthbox
remained
and
that
the
count
alone
knew
where
it
was
if
he
chooses
to
lie
hidden
he
may
baffle
us
for
years
and
in
the
meantimethe
thought
is
too
horrible
i
dare
not
think
of
it
even
now
this
i
know
that
if
ever
there
was
a
woman
who
was
all
perfection
that
one
is
my
poor
wronged
darling
i
love
her
a
thousand
times
more
for
her
sweet
pity
of
last
night
a
pity
that
made
my
own
hate
of
the
monster
seem
despicable
surely
god
will
not
permit
the
world
to
be
the
poorer
by
the
loss
of
such
a
creature
this
is
hope
to
me
we
are
all
drifting
reefwards
now
and
faith
is
our
only
anchor
thank
god
mina
is
sleeping
and
sleeping
without
dreams
i
fear
what
her
dreams
might
be
like
with
such
terrible
memories
to
ground
them
in
she
has
not
been
so
calm
within
my
seeing
since
the
sunset
then
for
a
while
there
came
over
her
face
a
repose
which
was
like
spring
after
the
blasts
of
march
i
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
the
softness
of
the
red
sunset
on
her
face
but
somehow
now
i
think
it
has
a
deeper
meaning
i
am
not
sleepy
myself
though
i
am
wearyweary
to
death
however
i
must
try
to
sleep
for
there
is
tomorrow
to
think
of
and
there
is
no
rest
for
me
until





lateri
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
i
was
awaked
by
mina
who
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
a
startled
look
on
her
face
i
could
see
easily
for
we
did
not
leave
the
room
in
darkness
she
had
placed
a
warning
hand
over
my
mouth
and
now
she
whispered
in
my
ear
hush
there
is
someone
in
the
corridor
i
got
up
softly
and
crossing
the
room
gently
opened
the
door
just
outside
stretched
on
a
mattress
lay
mr
morris
wide
awake
he
raised
a
warning
hand
for
silence
as
he
whispered
to
me
hush
go
back
to
bed
it
is
all
right
one
of
us
will
be
here
all
night
we
dont
mean
to
take
any
chances
his
look
and
gesture
forbade
discussion
so
i
came
back
and
told
mina
she
sighed
and
positively
a
shadow
of
a
smile
stole
over
her
poor
pale
face
as
she
put
her
arms
round
me
and
said
softly
oh
thank
god
for
good
brave
men
with
a
sigh
she
sank
back
again
to
sleep
i
write
this
now
as
i
am
not
sleepy
though
i
must
try
again





4
october
morningonce
again
during
the
night
i
was
wakened
by
mina
this
time
we
had
all
had
a
good
sleep
for
the
grey
of
the
coming
dawn
was
making
the
windows
into
sharp
oblongs
and
the
gas
flame
was
like
a
speck
rather
than
a
disc
of
light
she
said
to
me
hurriedly
go
call
the
professor
i
want
to
see
him
at
once
why
i
asked
i
have
an
idea
i
suppose
it
must
have
come
in
the
night
and
matured
without
my
knowing
it
he
must
hypnotise
me
before
the
dawn
and
then
i
shall
be
able
to
speak
go
quick
dearest
the
time
is
getting
close
i
went
to
the
door
dr
seward
was
resting
on
the
mattress
and
seeing
me
he
sprang
to
his
feet
is
anything
wrong
he
asked
in
alarm
no
i
replied
but
mina
wants
to
see
dr
van
helsing
at
once
i
will
go
he
said
and
hurried
into
the
professors
room
in
two
or
three
minutes
later
van
helsing
was
in
the
room
in
his
dressinggown
and
mr
morris
and
lord
godalming
were
with
dr
seward
at
the
door
asking
questions
when
the
professor
saw
mina
smilea
positive
smile
ousted
the
anxiety
of
his
face
he
rubbed
his
hands
as
he
said
oh
my
dear
madam
mina
this
is
indeed
a
change
see
friend
jonathan
we
have
got
our
dear
madam
mina
as
of
old
back
to
us
today
then
turning
to
her
he
said
cheerfully
and
what
am
i
do
for
you
for
at
this
hour
you
do
not
want
me
for
nothings
i
want
you
to
hypnotise
me
she
said
do
it
before
the
dawn
for
i
feel
that
then
i
can
speak
and
speak
freely
be
quick
for
the
time
is
short
without
a
word
he
motioned
her
to
sit
up
in
bed
looking
fixedly
at
her
he
commenced
to
make
passes
in
front
of
her
from
over
the
top
of
her
head
downward
with
each
hand
in
turn
mina
gazed
at
him
fixedly
for
a
few
minutes
during
which
my
own
heart
beat
like
a
trip
hammer
for
i
felt
that
some
crisis
was
at
hand
gradually
her
eyes
closed
and
she
sat
stock
still
only
by
the
gentle
heaving
of
her
bosom
could
one
know
that
she
was
alive
the
professor
made
a
few
more
passes
and
then
stopped
and
i
could
see
that
his
forehead
was
covered
with
great
beads
of
perspiration
mina
opened
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
seem
the
same
woman
there
was
a
faraway
look
in
her
eyes
and
her
voice
had
a
sad
dreaminess
which
was
new
to
me
raising
his
hand
to
impose
silence
the
professor
motioned
to
me
to
bring
the
others
in
they
came
on
tiptoe
closing
the
door
behind
them
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
looking
on
mina
appeared
not
to
see
them
the
stillness
was
broken
by
van
helsings
voice
speaking
in
a
low
level
tone
which
would
not
break
the
current
of
her
thoughts
where
are
you
the
answer
came
in
a
neutral
way
i
do
not
know
sleep
has
no
place
it
can
call
its
own
for
several
minutes
there
was
silence
mina
sat
rigid
and
the
professor
stood
staring
at
her
fixedly
the
rest
of
us
hardly
dared
to
breathe
the
room
was
growing
lighter
without
taking
his
eyes
from
minas
face
dr
van
helsing
motioned
me
to
pull
up
the
blind
i
did
so
and
the
day
seemed
just
upon
us
a
red
streak
shot
up
and
a
rosy
light
seemed
to
diffuse
itself
through
the
room
on
the
instant
the
professor
spoke
again
where
are
you
now
the
answer
came
dreamily
but
with
intention
it
were
as
though
she
were
interpreting
something
i
have
heard
her
use
the
same
tone
when
reading
her
shorthand
notes
i
do
not
know
it
is
all
strange
to
me
what
do
you
see
i
can
see
nothing
it
is
all
dark
what
do
you
hear
i
could
detect
the
strain
in
the
professors
patient
voice
the
lapping
of
water
it
is
gurgling
by
and
little
waves
leap
i
can
hear
them
on
the
outside
then
you
are
on
a
ship
we
all
looked
at
each
other
trying
to
glean
something
each
from
the
other
we
were
afraid
to
think
the
answer
came
quick
oh
yes
what
else
do
you
hear
the
sound
of
men
stamping
overhead
as
they
run
about
there
is
the
creaking
of
a
chain
and
the
loud
tinkle
as
the
check
of
the
capstan
falls
into
the
rachet
what
are
you
doing
i
am
stilloh
so
still
it
is
like
death
the
voice
faded
away
into
a
deep
breath
as
of
one
sleeping
and
the
open
eyes
closed
again
by
this
time
the
sun
had
risen
and
we
were
all
in
the
full
light
of
day
dr
van
helsing
placed
his
hands
on
minas
shoulders
and
laid
her
head
down
softly
on
her
pillow
she
lay
like
a
sleeping
child
for
a
few
moments
and
then
with
a
long
sigh
awoke
and
stared
in
wonder
to
see
us
all
around
her
have
i
been
talking
in
my
sleep
was
all
she
said
she
seemed
however
to
know
the
situation
without
telling
though
she
was
eager
to
know
what
she
had
told
the
professor
repeated
the
conversation
and
she
said
then
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
it
may
not
be
yet
too
late
mr
morris
and
lord
godalming
started
for
the
door
but
the
professors
calm
voice
called
them
back
stay
my
friends
that
ship
wherever
it
was
was
weighing
anchor
whilst
she
spoke
there
are
many
ships
weighing
anchor
at
the
moment
in
your
so
great
port
of
london
which
of
them
is
it
that
you
seek
god
be
thanked
that
we
have
once
again
a
clue
though
whither
it
may
lead
us
we
know
not
we
have
been
blind
somewhat
blind
after
the
manner
of
men
since
when
we
can
look
back
we
see
what
we
might
have
seen
looking
forward
if
we
had
been
able
to
see
what
we
might
have
seen
alas
but
that
sentence
is
a
puddle
is
it
not
we
can
know
now
what
was
in
the
counts
mind
when
he
seize
that
money
though
jonathans
so
fierce
knife
put
him
in
the
danger
that
even
he
dread
he
meant
escape
hear
me
escape
he
saw
that
with
but
one
earthbox
left
and
a
pack
of
men
following
like
dogs
after
a
fox
this
london
was
no
place
for
him
he
have
take
his
last
earthbox
on
board
a
ship
and
he
leave
the
land
he
think
to
escape
but
no
we
follow
him
tally
ho
as
friend
arthur
would
say
when
he
put
on
his
red
frock
our
old
fox
is
wily
oh
so
wily
and
we
must
follow
with
wile
i
too
am
wily
and
i
think
his
mind
in
a
little
while
in
meantime
we
may
rest
and
in
peace
for
there
are
waters
between
us
which
he
do
not
want
to
pass
and
which
he
could
not
if
he
wouldunless
the
ship
were
to
touch
the
land
and
then
only
at
full
or
slack
tide
see
and
the
sun
is
just
rose
and
all
day
to
sunset
is
to
us
let
us
take
bath
and
dress
and
have
breakfast
which
we
all
need
and
which
we
can
eat
comfortably
since
he
be
not
in
the
same
land
with
us
mina
looked
at
him
appealingly
as
she
asked
but
why
need
we
seek
him
further
when
he
is
gone
away
from
us
he
took
her
hand
and
patted
it
as
he
replied
ask
me
nothings
as
yet
when
we
have
breakfast
then
i
answer
all
questions
he
would
say
no
more
and
we
separated
to
dress
after
breakfast
mina
repeated
her
question
he
looked
at
her
gravely
for
a
minute
and
then
said
sorrowfully
because
my
dear
dear
madam
mina
now
more
than
ever
must
we
find
him
even
if
we
have
to
follow
him
to
the
jaws
of
hell
she
grew
paler
as
she
asked
faintly
why
because
he
answered
solemnly
he
can
live
for
centuries
and
you
are
but
mortal
woman
time
is
now
to
be
dreadedsince
once
he
put
that
mark
upon
your
throat
i
was
just
in
time
to
catch
her
as
she
fell
forward
in
a
faint

i
read
to
mina
van
helsings
message
in
the
phonograph
the
poor
girl
brightened
up
considerably
already
the
certainty
that
the
count
is
out
of
the
country
has
given
her
comfort
and
comfort
is
strength
to
her
for
my
own
part
now
that
his
horrible
danger
is
not
face
to
face
with
us
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
believe
in
it
even
my
own
terrible
experiences
in
castle
dracula
seem
like
a
longforgotten
dream
here
in
the
crisp
autumn
air
in
the
bright
sunlight
alas
how
can
i
disbelieve
in
the
midst
of
my
thought
my
eye
fell
on
the
red
scar
on
my
poor
darlings
white
forehead
whilst
that
lasts
there
can
be
no
disbelief
and
afterwards
the
very
memory
of
it
will
keep
faith
crystal
clear
mina
and
i
fear
to
be
idle
so
we
have
been
over
all
the
diaries
again
and
again
somehow
although
the
reality
seems
greater
each
time
the
pain
and
the
fear
seem
less
there
is
something
of
a
guiding
purpose
manifest
throughout
which
is
comforting
mina
says
that
perhaps
we
are
the
instruments
of
ultimate
good
it
may

i

to
think

we

never

yet
of

it
is

we

the

and
the
others
after
their
investigations
the

mr

jonathan

mina
harker
dr
van
helsing
described
what
steps
were
taken
during
the
day
to
discover
on
what
boat
and
whither
bound
count
dracula
made
his
escape
as
i
knew
that
he
wanted
to
get
back
to
transylvania
i
felt
sure
that
he
must
go
by
the
danube
mouth
or
by
somewhere
in
the
black
sea
since
by
that
way
he
come
it
was
a
dreary
blank
that
was
before
us
omne
ignotum
pro
magnifico
and
so
with
heavy
hearts
we
start
to
find
what
ships
leave
for
the
black
sea
last
night
he
was
in
sailing
ship
since
madam
mina
tell
of
sails
being
set
these
not
so
important
as
to
go
in
your
list
of
the
shipping
in
the
times
and
so
we
go
by
suggestion
of
lord
godalming
to
your
lloyds
where
are
note
of
all
ships
that
sail
however
so
small
there
we
find
that
only
one
blackseabound
ship
go
out
with
the
tide
she
is
the
czarina
catherine
and
she
sail
from
doolittles
wharf
for
varna
and
thence
on
to
other
parts
and
up
the
danube
soh
said
i
this
is
the
ship
whereon
is
the
count
so
off
we
go
to
doolittles
wharf
and
there
we
find
a
man
in
an
office
of
wood
so
small
that
the
man
look
bigger
than
the
office
from
him
we
inquire
of
the
goings
of
the
czarina
catherine
he
swear
much
and
he
red
face
and
loud
of
voice
but
he
good
fellow
all
the
same
and
when
quincey
give
him
something
from
his
pocket
which
crackle
as
he
roll
it
up
and
put
it
in
a
so
small
bag
which
he
have
hid
deep
in
his
clothing
he
still
better
fellow
and
humble
servant
to
us
he
come
with
us
and
ask
many
men
who
are
rough
and
hot
these
be
better
fellows
too
when
they
have
been
no
more
thirsty
they
say
much
of
blood
and
bloom
and
of
others
which
i
comprehend
not
though
i
guess
what
they
mean
but
nevertheless
they
tell
us
all
things
which
we
want
to
know
they
make
known
to
us
among
them
how
last
afternoon
at
about
five
oclock
comes
a
man
so
hurry
a
tall
man
thin
and
pale
with
high
nose
and
teeth
so
white
and
eyes
that
seem
to
be
burning
that
he
be
all
in
black
except
that
he
have
a
hat
of
straw
which
suit
not
him
or
the
time
that
he
scatter
his
money
in
making
quick
inquiry
as
to
what
ship
sails
for
the
black
sea
and
for
where
some
took
him
to
the
office
and
then
to
the
ship
where
he
will
not
go
aboard
but
halt
at
shore
end
of
gangplank
and
ask
that
the
captain
come
to
him
the
captain
come
when
told
that
he
will
be
pay
well
and
though
he
swear
much
at
the
first
he
agree
to
term
then
the
thin
man
go
and
some
one
tell
him
where
horse
and
cart
can
be
hired
he
go
there
and
soon
he
come
again
himself
driving
cart
on
which
a
great
box
this
he
himself
lift
down
though
it
take
several
to
put
it
on
truck
for
the
ship
he
give
much
talk
to
captain
as
to
how
and
where
his
box
is
to
be
place
but
the
captain
like
it
not
and
swear
at
him
in
many
tongues
and
tell
him
that
if
he
like
he
can
come
and
see
where
it
shall
be
but
he
say
no
that
he
come
not
yet
for
that
he
have
much
to
do
whereupon
the
captain
tell
him
that
he
had
better
be
quickwith
bloodfor
that
his
ship
will
leave
the
placeof
bloodbefore
the
turn
of
the
tidewith
blood
then
the
thin
man
smile
and
say
that
of
course
he
must
go
when
he
think
fit
but
he
will
be
surprise
if
he
go
quite
so
soon
the
captain
swear
again
polyglot
and
the
thin
man
make
him
bow
and
thank
him
and
say
that
he
will
so
far
intrude
on
his
kindness
as
to
come
aboard
before
the
sailing
final
the
captain
more
red
than
ever
and
in
more
tongues
tell
him
that
he
doesnt
want
no
frenchmenwith
bloom
upon
them
and
also
with
bloodin
his
shipwith
blood
on
her
also
and
so
after
asking
where
there
might
be
close
at
hand
a
ship
where
he
might
purchase
ship
forms
he
departed
no
one
knew
where
he
went
or
bloomin
well
cared
as
they
said
for
they
had
something
else
to
think
ofwell
with
blood
again
for
it
soon
became
apparent
to
all
that
the
czarina
catherine
would
not
sail
as
was
expected
a
thin
mist
began
to
creep
up
from
the
river
and
it
grew
and
grew
till
soon
a
dense
fog
enveloped
the
ship
and
all
around
her
the
captain
swore
polyglotvery
polyglotpolyglot
with
bloom
and
blood
but
he
could
do
nothing
the
water
rose
and
rose
and
he
began
to
fear
that
he
would
lose
the
tide
altogether
he
was
in
no
friendly
mood
when
just
at
full
tide
the
thin
man
came
up
the
gangplank
again
and
asked
to
see
where
his
box
had
been
stowed
then
the
captain
replied
that
he
wished
that
he
and
his
boxold
and
with
much
bloom
and
bloodwere
in
hell
but
the
thin
man
did
not
be
offend
and
went
down
with
the
mate
and
saw
where
it
was
place
and
came
up
and
stood
awhile
on
deck
in
fog
he
must
have
come
off
by
himself
for
none
notice
him
indeed
they
thought
not
of
him
for
soon
the
fog
begin
to
melt
away
and
all
was
clear
again
my
friends
of
the
thirst
and
the
language
that
was
of
bloom
and
blood
laughed
as
they
told
how
the
captains
swears
exceeded
even
his
usual
polyglot
and
was
more
than
ever
full
of
picturesque
when
on
questioning
other
mariners
who
were
on
movement
up
and
down
on
the
river
that
hour
he
found
that
few
of
them
had
seen
any
of
fog
at
all
except
where
it
lay
round
the
wharf
however
the
ship
went
out
on
the
ebb
tide
and
was
doubtless
by
morning
far
down
the
river
mouth
she
was
by
then
when
they
told
us
well
out
to
sea
and
so
my
dear
madam
mina
it
is
that
we
have
to
rest
for
a
time
for
our
enemy
is
on
the
sea
with
the
fog
at
his
command
on
his
way
to
the
danube
mouth
to
sail
a
ship
takes
time
go
she
never
so
quick
and
when
we
start
we
go
on
land
more
quick
and
we
meet
him
there
our
best
hope
is
to
come
on
him
when
in
the
box
between
sunrise
and
sunset
for
then
he
can
make
no
struggle
and
we
may
deal
with
him
as
we
should
there
are
days
for
us
in
which
we
can
make
ready
our
plan
we
know
all
about
where
he
go
for
we
have
seen
the
owner
of
the
ship
who
have
shown
us
invoices
and
all
papers
that
can
be
the
box
we
seek
is
to
be
landed
in
varna
and
to
be
given
to
an
agent
one
ristics
who
will
there
present
his
credentials
and
so
our
merchant
friend
will
have
done
his
part
when
he
ask
if
there
be
any
wrong
for
that
so
he
can
telegraph
and
have
inquiry
made
at
varna
we
say
no
for
what
is
to
be
done
is
not
for
police
or
of
the
customs
it
must
be
done
by
us
alone
and
in
our
own
way
when
dr
van
helsing
had
done
speaking
i
asked
him
if
he
were
certain
that
the
count
had
remained
on
board
the
ship
he
replied
we
have
the
best
proof
of
that
your
own
evidence
when
in
the
hypnotic
trance
this
morning
i
asked
him
again
if
it
were
really
necessary
that
they
should
pursue
the
count
for
oh
i
dread
jonathan
leaving
me
and
i
know
that
he
would
surely
go
if
the
others
went
he
answered
in
growing
passion
at
first
quietly
as
he
went
on
however
he
grew
more
angry
and
more
forceful
till
in
the
end
we
could
not
but
see
wherein
was
at
least
some
of
that
personal
dominance
which
made
him
so
long
a
master
amongst
men
yes
it
is
necessarynecessarynecessary
for
your
sake
in
the
first
and
then
for
the
sake
of
humanity
this
monster
has
done
much
harm
already
in
the
narrow
scope
where
he
find
himself
and
in
the
short
time
when
as
yet
he
was
only
as
a
body
groping
his
so
small
measure
in
darkness
and
not
knowing
all
this
have
i
told
these
others
you
my
dear
madam
mina
will
learn
it
in
the
phonograph
of
my
friend
john
or
in
that
of
your
husband
i
have
told
them
how
the
measure
of
leaving
his
own
barren
landbarren
of
peoplesand
coming
to
a
new
land
where
life
of
man
teems
till
they
are
like
the
multitude
of
standing
corn
was
the
work
of
centuries
were
another
of
the
undead
like
him
to
try
to
do
what
he
has
done
perhaps
not
all
the
centuries
of
the
world
that
have
been
or
that
will
be
could
aid
him
with
this
one
all
the
forces
of
nature
that
are
occult
and
deep
and
strong
must
have
worked
together
in
some
wondrous
way
the
very
place
where
he
have
been
alive
undead
for
all
these
centuries
is
full
of
strangeness
of
the
geologic
and
chemical
world
there
are
deep
caverns
and
fissures
that
reach
none
know
whither
there
have
been
volcanoes
some
of
whose
openings
still
send
out
waters
of
strange
properties
and
gases
that
kill
or
make
to
vivify
doubtless
there
is
something
magnetic
or
electric
in
some
of
these
combinations
of
occult
forces
which
work
for
physical
life
in
strange
way
and
in
himself
were
from
the
first
some
great
qualities
in
a
hard
and
warlike
time
he
was
celebrate
that
he
have
more
iron
nerve
more
subtle
brain
more
braver
heart
than
any
man
in
him
some
vital
principle
have
in
strange
way
found
their
utmost
and
as
his
body
keep
strong
and
grow
and
thrive
so
his
brain
grow
too
all
this
without
that
diabolic
aid
which
is
surely
to
him
for
it
have
to
yield
to
the
powers
that
come
from
and
are
symbolic
of
good

now
this
is
what
he
is
to
us
he
have
infect
youoh
forgive
me
my
dear
that
i
must
say
such
but
it
is
for
good
of
you
that
i
speak
he
infect
you
in
such
wise
that
even
if
he

no
more
you
have
only
to
liveto
live
in
your
own
old
sweet
way
and
so
in
time

which
is
of
mans
common
lot
and
with
gods

shall
make
you
like
to
him
this
must
not
be
we
have
sworn
together
that
it
must
not
thus
are
we
ministers
of
gods
own
wish
that
the
world
and
men
for
whom
his
son
die
will
not
be
given
over
to
monsters
whose
very
existence
would
defame
him
he
have
allowed
us
to
redeem
one
soul
already
and
we
go
out
as
the
old
knights
of
the
cross
to
redeem
more
like
them
we
shall
travel
towards
the
sunrise
and
like
them
if
we
fall
we
fall
in
good
cause
he
paused
and
i
said
but
will
not
the
count
take
his
rebuff
wisely
since
he
has
been
driven
from
england
will
he
not
avoid
it
as
a
tiger
does
the
village
from
which
he
has
been
hunted
aha
he
said
your
simile
of
the
tiger
good
for
me
and
i
shall
adopt
him
your
maneater
as
they
of
india
call
the
tiger
who
has
once
tasted
blood
of
the
human
care
no
more
for
the
other
prey
but
prowl
unceasing
till
he
get
him
this
that
we
hunt
from
our
village
is
a
tiger
too
a
maneater
and
he
never
cease
to
prowl
nay
in
himself
he
is
not
one
to
retire
and
stay
afar
in
his
life
his
living
life
he
go
over
the
turkey
frontier
and
attack
his
enemy
on
his
own
ground
he
be
beaten
back
but
did
he
stay
no
he
come
again
and
again
and
again
look
at
his
persistence
and
endurance
with
the
childbrain
that
was
to
him
he
have
long
since
conceive
the
idea
of
coming
to
a
great
city
what
does
he
do
he
find
out
the
place
of
all
the
world
most
of
promise
for
him
then
he
deliberately
set
himself
down
to
prepare
for
the
task
he
find
in
patience
just
how
is
his
strength
and
what
are
his
powers
he
study
new
tongues
he
learn
new
social
life
new
environment
of
old
ways
the
politic
the
law
the
finance
the
science
the
habit
of
a
new
land
and
a
new
people
who
have
come
to
be
since
he
was
his
glimpse
that
he
have
had
whet
his
appetite
only
and
enkeen
his
desire
nay
it
help
him
to
grow
as
to
his
brain
for
it
all
prove
to
him
how
right
he
was
at
the
first
in
his
surmises
he
have
done
this
alone
all
alone
from
a
ruin
tomb
in
a
forgotten
land
what
more
may
he
not
do
when
the
greater
world
of
thought
is
open
to
him
he
that
can
smile
at
death
as
we
know
him
who
can
flourish
in
the
midst
of
diseases
that
kill
off
whole
peoples
oh
if
such
an
one
was
to
come
from
god
and
not
the
devil
what
a
force
for
good
might
he
not
be
in
this
old
world
of
ours
but
we
are
pledged
to
set
the
world
free
our
toil
must
be
in
silence
and
our
efforts
all
in
secret
for
in
this
enlightened
age
when
men
believe
not
even
what
they
see
the
doubting
of
wise
men
would
be
his
greatest
strength
it
would
be
at
once
his
sheath
and
his
armour
and
his
weapons
to
destroy
us
his
enemies
who
are
willing
to
peril
even
our
own
souls
for
the
safety
of
one
we
lovefor
the
good
of
mankind
and
for
the
honour
and
glory
of
god
after
a
general
discussion
it
was
determined
that
for
tonight
nothing
be
definitely
settled
that
we
should
all
sleep
on
the
facts
and
try
to
think
out
the
proper
conclusions
tomorrow
at
breakfast
we
are
to
meet
again
and
after
making
our
conclusions
known
to
one
another
we
shall
decide
on
some
definite
cause
of
action





i
feel
a
wonderful
peace
and
rest
tonight
it
is
as
if
some
haunting
presence
were
removed
from
me
perhaps

my
surmise
was
not
finished
could
not
be
for
i
caught
sight
in
the
mirror
of
the
red
mark
upon
my
forehead
and
i
knew
that
i
was
still
unclean

5
octoberwe
all
rose
early
and
i
think
that
sleep
did
much
for
each
and
all
of
us
when
we
met
at
early
breakfast
there
was
more
general
cheerfulness
than
any
of
us
had
ever
expected
to
experience
again
it
is
really
wonderful
how
much
resilience
there
is
in
human
nature
let
any
obstructing
cause
no
matter
what
be
removed
in
any
wayeven
by
deathand
we
fly
back
to
first
principles
of
hope
and
enjoyment
more
than
once
as
we
sat
around
the
table
my
eyes
opened
in
wonder
whether
the
whole
of
the
past
days
had
not
been
a
dream
it
was
only
when
i
caught
sight
of
the
red
blotch
on
mrs
harkers
forehead
that
i
was
brought
back
to
reality
even
now
when
i
am
gravely
revolving
the
matter
it
is
almost
impossible
to
realise
that
the
cause
of
all
our
trouble
is
still
existent
even
mrs
harker
seems
to
lose
sight
of
her
trouble
for
whole
spells
it
is
only
now
and
again
when
something
recalls
it
to
her
mind
that
she
thinks
of
her
terrible
scar
we
are
to
meet
here
in
my
study
in
half
an
hour
and
decide
on
our
course
of
action
i
see
only
one
immediate
difficulty
i
know
it
by
instinct
rather
than
reason
we
shall
all
have
to
speak
frankly
and
yet
i
fear
that
in
some
mysterious
way
poor
mrs
harkers
tongue
is
tied
i
know
that
she
forms
conclusions
of
her
own
and
from
all
that
has
been
i
can
guess
how
brilliant
and
how
true
they
must
be
but
she
will
not
or
cannot
give
them
utterance
i
have
mentioned
this
to
van
helsing
and
he
and
i
are
to
talk
it
over
when
we
are
alone
i
suppose
it
is
some
of
that
horrid
poison
which
has
got
into
her
veins
beginning
to
work
the
count
had
his
own
purposes
when
he
gave
her
what
van
helsing
called
the
vampires
baptism
of
blood
well
there
may
be
a
poison
that
distils
itself
out
of
good
things
in
an
age
when
the
existence
of
ptomaines
is
a
mystery
we
should
not
wonder
at
anything
one
thing
i
know
that
if
my
instinct
be
true
regarding
poor
mrs
harkers
silences
then
there
is
a
terrible
difficultyan
unknown
dangerin
the
work
before
us
the
same
power
that
compels
her
silence
may
compel
her
speech
i
dare
not
think
further
for
so
i
should
in
my
thoughts
dishonour
a
noble
woman
van
helsing
is
coming
to
my
study
a
little
before
the
others
i
shall
try
to
open
the
subject
with
him





laterwhen
the
professor
came
in
we
talked
over
the
state
of
things
i
could
see
that
he
had
something
on
his
mind
which
he
wanted
to
say
but
felt
some
hesitancy
about
broaching
the
subject
after
beating
about
the
bush
a
little
he
said
suddenly
friend
john
there
is
something
that
you
and
i
must
talk
of
alone
just
at
the
first
at
any
rate
later
we
may
have
to
take
the
others
into
our
confidence
then
he
stopped
so
i
waited
he
went
on
madam
mina
our
poor
dear
madam
mina
is
changing
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
me
to
find
my
worst
fears
thus
endorsed
van
helsing
continued
with
the
sad
experience
of
miss
lucy
we
must
this
time
be
warned
before
things
go
too
far
our
task
is
now
in
reality
more
difficult
than
ever
and
this
new
trouble
makes
every
hour
of
the
direst
importance
i
can
see
the
characteristics
of
the
vampire
coming
in
her
face
it
is
now
but
very
very
slight
but
it
is
to
be
seen
if
we
have
eyes
to
notice
without
to
prejudge
her
teeth
are
some
sharper
and
at
times
her
eyes
are
more
hard
but
these
are
not
all
there
is
to
her
the
silence
now
often
as
so
it
was
with
miss
lucy
she
did
not
speak
even
when
she
wrote
that
which
she
wished
to
be
known
later
now
my
fear
is
this
if
it
be
that
she
can
by
our
hypnotic
trance
tell
what
the
count
see
and
hear
is
it
not
more
true
that
he
who
have
hypnotise
her
first
and
who
have
drink
of
her
very
blood
and
make
her
drink
of
his
should
if
he
will
compel
her
mind
to
disclose
to
him
that
which
she
know
i
nodded
acquiescence
he
went
on
then
what
we
must
do
is
to
prevent
this
we
must
keep
her
ignorant
of
our
intent
and
so
she
cannot
tell
what
she
know
not
this
is
a
painful
task
oh
so
painful
that
it
heartbreak
me
to
think
of
but
it
must
be
when
today
we
meet
i
must
tell
her
that
for
reason
which
we
will
not
to
speak
she
must
not
more
be
of
our
council
but
be
simply
guarded
by
us
he
wiped
his
forehead
which
had
broken
out
in
profuse
perspiration
at
the
thought
of
the
pain
which
he
might
have
to
inflict
upon
the
poor
soul
already
so
tortured
i
knew
that
it
would
be
some
sort
of
comfort
to
him
if
i
told
him
that
i
also
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
for
at
any
rate
it
would
take
away
the
pain
of
doubt
i
told
him
and
the
effect
was
as
i
expected
it
is
now
close
to
the
time
of
our
general
gathering
van
helsing
has
gone
away
to
prepare
for
the
meeting
and
his
painful
part
of
it
i
really
believe
his
purpose
is
to
be
able
to
pray
alone





laterat
the
very
outset
of
our
meeting
a
great
personal
relief
was
experienced
by
both
van
helsing
and
myself
mrs
harker
had
sent
a
message
by
her
husband
to
say
that
she
would
not
join
us
at
present
as
she
thought
it
better
that
we
should
be
free
to
discuss
our
movements
without
her
presence
to
embarrass
us
the
professor
and
i
looked
at
each
other
for
an
instant
and
somehow
we
both
seemed
relieved
for
my
own
part
i
thought
that
if
mrs
harker
realised
the
danger
herself
it
was
much
pain
as
well
as
much
danger
averted
under
the
circumstances
we
agreed
by
a
questioning
look
and
answer
with
finger
on
lip
to
preserve
silence
in
our
suspicions
until
we
should
have
been
able
to
confer
alone
again
we
went
at
once
into
our
plan
of
campaign
van
helsing
roughly
put
the
facts
before
us
first
the
czarina
catherine
left
the
thames
yesterday
morning
it
will
take
her
at
the
quickest
speed
she
has
ever
made
at
least
three
weeks
to
reach
varna
but
we
can
travel
overland
to
the
same
place
in
three
days
now
if
we
allow
for
two
days
less
for
the
ships
voyage
owing
to
such
weather
influences
as
we
know
that
the
count
can
bring
to
bear
and
if
we
allow
a
whole
day
and
night
for
any
delays
which
may
occur
to
us
then
we
have
a
margin
of
nearly
two
weeks
thus
in
order
to
be
quite
safe
we
must
leave
here
on
17th
at
latest
then
we
shall
at
any
rate
be
in
varna
a
day
before
the
ship
arrives
and
able
to
make
such
preparations
as
may
be
necessary
of
course
we
shall
all
go
armedarmed
against
evil
things
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
here

morris
added
i
understand
that
the
count
comes
from
a
wolf
country
and
it
may
be
that
he
shall
get
there
before
us
i
propose
that
we
add
winchesters
to
our
armament
i
have
a
kind
of
belief
in
a
winchester
when
there
is
any
trouble
of
that
sort
around
do
you
remember

when
we
had
the

us
at

head
is
level
at
all
times

most
so
when
there
is
to
hunt
metaphor
be
more
dishonour
to

than
wolves
be
of

to

in
the
meantime
we
can
do
nothing
here
and
as
i
think
that
varna
is
not
familiar
to
any
of
us
why
not
go
there
more
soon
it
is
as
long
to
wait
here
as
there
tonight
and
tomorrow
we
can
get
ready
and
then
if
all
be
well
we
four
can
set
out
on

journey

said
harker
interrogatively
looking
from
one
to
another
of
us
of
course
answered
the
professor
quickly
you
must
remain
to
take
care
of
your
so
sweet
wife
harker
was
silent
for
awhile
and
then
said
in
a
hollow
voice
let
us
talk
of
that
part
of
it
in
the
morning
i
want
to
consult
with
mina
i
thought
that
now
was
the
time
for
van
helsing
to
warn
him
not
to
disclose
our
plans
to
her
but
he
took
no
notice
i
looked
at
him
significantly
and
coughed
for
answer
he
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
turned
away

5
october
afternoonfor
some
time
after
our
meeting
this
morning
i
could
not
think
the
new
phases
of
things
leave
my
mind
in
a
state
of
wonder
which
allows
no
room
for
active
thought
minas
determination
not
to
take
any
part
in
the
discussion
set
me
thinking
and
as
i
could
not
argue
the
matter
with
her
i
could
only
guess
i
am
as
far
as
ever
from
a
solution
now
the
way
the
others
received
it
too
puzzled
me
the
last
time
we
talked
of
the
subject
we
agreed
that
there
was
to
be
no
more
concealment
of
anything
amongst
us
mina
is
sleeping
now
calmly
and
sweetly
like
a
little
child
her
lips
are
curved
and
her
face
beams
with
happiness
thank
god
there
are
such
moments
still
for
her





laterhow
strange
it
all
is
i
sat
watching
minas
happy
sleep
and
came
as
near
to
being
happy
myself
as
i
suppose
i
shall
ever
be
as
the
evening
drew
on
and
the
earth
took
its
shadows
from
the
sun
sinking
lower
the
silence
of
the
room
grew
more
and
more
solemn
to
me
all
at
once
mina
opened
her
eyes
and
looking
at
me
tenderly
said
jonathan
i
want
you
to
promise
me
something
on
your
word
of
honour
a
promise
made
to
me
but
made
holily
in
gods
hearing
and
not
to
be
broken
though
i
should
go
down
on
my
knees
and
implore
you
with
bitter
tears
quick
you
must
make
it
to
me
at
once
mina
i
said
a
promise
like
that
i
cannot
make
at
once
i
may
have
no
right
to
make
it
but
dear
one
she
said
with
such
spiritual
intensity
that
her
eyes
were
like
pole
stars
it
is
i
who
wish
it
and
it
is
not
for
myself
you
can
ask
dr
van
helsing
if
i
am
not
right
if
he
disagrees
you
may
do
as
you
will
nay
more
if
you
all
agree
later
you
are
absolved
from
the
promise
i
promise
i
said
and
for
a
moment
she
looked
supremely
happy
though
to
me
all
happiness
for
her
was
denied
by
the
red
scar
on
her
forehead
she
said
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
me
anything
of
the
plans
formed
for
the
campaign
against
the
count
not
by
word
or
inference
or
implication
not
at
any
time
whilst
this
remains
to
me
and
she
solemnly
pointed
to
the
scar
i
saw
that
she
was
in
earnest
and
said
solemnly
i
promise
and
as
i
said
it
i
felt
that
from
that
instant
a
door
had
been
shut
between
us





later
midnightmina
has
been
bright
and
cheerful
all
the
evening
so
much
so
that
all
the
rest
seemed
to
take
courage
as
if
infected
somewhat
with
her
gaiety
as
a
result
even
i
myself
felt
as
if
the
pall
of
gloom
which
weighs
us
down
were
somewhat
lifted
we
all
retired
early
mina
is
now
sleeping
like
a
little
child
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
that
her
faculty
of
sleep
remains
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
terrible
trouble
thank
god
for
it
for
then
at
least
she
can
forget
her
care
perhaps
her
example
may
affect
me
as
her
gaiety
did
tonight
i
shall
try
it
oh
for
a
dreamless
sleep





6
october
morninganother
surprise
mina
woke
me
early
about
the
same
time
as
yesterday
and
asked
me
to
bring
dr
van
helsing
i
thought
that
it
was
another
occasion
for
hypnotism
and
without
question
went
for
the
professor
he
had
evidently
expected
some
such
call
for
i
found
him
dressed
in
his
room
his
door
was
ajar
so
that
he
could
hear
the
opening
of
the
door
of
our
room
he
came
at
once
as
he
passed
into
the
room
he
asked
mina
if
the
others
might
come
too
no
she
said
quite
simply
it
will
not
be
necessary
you
can
tell
them
just
as
well
i
must
go
with
you
on
your
journey
dr
van
helsing
was
as
startled
as
i
was
after
a
moments
pause
he
asked
but
why
you
must
take
me
with
you
i
am
safer
with
you
and
you
shall
be
safer
too
but
why
dear
madam
mina
you
know
that
your
safety
is
our
solemnest
duty
we
go
into
danger
to
which
you
are
or
may
be
more
liable
than
any
of
us
fromfrom
circumstancesthings
that
have
been
he
paused
embarrassed
as
she
replied
she
raised
her
finger
and
pointed
to
her
forehead
i
know
that
is
why
i
must
go
i
can
tell
you
now
whilst
the
sun
is
coming
up
i
may
not
be
able
again
i
know
that
when
the
count
wills
me
i
must
go
i
know
that
if
he
tells
me
to
come
in
secret
i
must
come
by
wile
by
any
device
to
hoodwinkeven
jonathan
god
saw
the
look
that
she
turned
on
me
as
she
spoke
and
if
there
be
indeed
a
recording
angel
that
look
is
noted
to
her
everlasting
honour
i
could
only
clasp
her
hand
i
could
not
speak
my
emotion
was
too
great
for
even
the
relief
of
tears
she
went
on
you
men
are
brave
and
strong
you
are
strong
in
your
numbers
for
you
can
defy
that
which
would
break
down
the
human
endurance
of
one
who
had
to
guard
alone
besides
i
may
be
of
service
since
you
can
hypnotise
me
and
so
learn
that
which
even
i
myself
do
not
know
dr
van
helsing
said
very
gravely
madam
mina
you
are
as
always
most
wise
you
shall
with
us
come
and
together
we
shall
do
that
which
we
go
forth
to
achieve
when
he
had
spoken
minas
long
spell
of
silence
made
me
look
at
her
she
had
fallen
back
on
her
pillow
asleep
she
did
not
even
wake
when
i
had
pulled
up
the
blind
and
let
in
the
sunlight
which
flooded
the
room
van
helsing
motioned
to
me
to
come
with
him
quietly
we
went
to
his
room
and
within
a
minute
lord
godalming
dr
seward
and
mr
morris
were
with
us
also
he
told
them
what
mina
had
said
and
went
on
in
the
morning
we
shall
leave
for
varna
we
have
now
to
deal
with
a
new
factor
madam
mina
oh
but
her
soul
is
true
it
is
to
her
an
agony
to
tell
us
so
much
as
she
has
done
but
it
is
most
right
and
we
are
warned
in
time
there
must
be
no
chance
lost
and
in
varna
we
must
be
ready
to
act
the
instant
when
that
ship
arrives
what
shall
we
do
exactly
asked
mr
morris
laconically
the
professor
paused
before
replying
we
shall
at
the
first
board
that
ship
then
when
we
have
identified
the
box
we
shall
place
a
branch
of
the
wild
rose
on
it
this
we
shall
fasten
for
when
it
is
there
none
can
emerge
so
at
least
says
the
superstition
and
to
superstition
must
we
trust
at
the
first
it
was
mans
faith
in
the
early
and
it
have
its
root
in
faith
still
then
when
we
get
the
opportunity
that
we
seek
when
none
are
near
to
see
we
shall
open
the
box
andand
all
will
be
well
i
shall
not
wait
for
any
opportunity
said
morris
when
i
see
the
box
i
shall
open
it
and
destroy
the
monster
though
there
were
a
thousand
men
looking
on
and
if
i
am
to
be
wiped
out
for
it
the
next
moment
i
grasped
his
hand
instinctively
and
found
it
as
firm
as
a
piece
of
steel
i
think
he
understood
my
look
i
hope
he
did

me
none
of
us
shall
lag
behind

from
any
fear
i
do

may
dowhat
we
must
do
but
indeed
indeed
we
cannot
say
what
we
shall

there
are
so
many
things
which
may
happen
and
their
ways
and
their
ends
are
so
various
that
until
the
moment
we
may
not
say
we
shall
all
be
armed
in
all
ways

when
the
time
for
the
end
has
come

not

let
us
today
put
all
our
affairs
in
order
let
all
things
which
touch
on
others
dear
to
us
and
who
on
us
depend
be
complete
for
none
of
us
can
tell
what
or
when
or
how
the
end
may
be

for
me
my
own
affairs
are
regulate
and
as
i
have
nothing
else
to
do
i
shall
go
make
arrangements
for
the
travel
i
shall
have
all
tickets
and
so
forth
for
our
journey
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
and
we
parted
i
shall
now
settle
up
all
my
affairs

now
drawing
towards
the
sunset
minas
uneasiness
calls
my
attention
to
it
i
am
sure
that
there
is
something
on
her
mind
which
the
time
of
exact
sunset
will
reveal
these
occasions
are
becoming
harrowing
times
for
us
all
for
each
sunrise
and
sunset
opens
up
some
new
dangersome
new
pain
which
however
may
in
gods
will
be
means
to
a
good
end
i
write
all
these
things
in
the
diary

my
darling
must
not
hear
them
now

it
may

11
october
eveningjonathan
harker
has
asked
me
to
note
this
as
he
says
he
is
hardly
equal
to
the
task
and
he
wants
an
exact
record
kept
i
think
that
none
of
us
were
surprised
when
we
were
asked
to
see
mrs
harker
a
little
before
the
time
of
sunset
we
have
of
late
come
to
understand
that
sunrise
and
sunset
are
to
her
times
of
peculiar
freedom
when
her
old
self
can
be
manifest
without
any
controlling
force
subduing
or
restraining
her
or
inciting
her
to
action
this
mood
or
condition
begins
some
half
hour
or
more
before
actual
sunrise
or
sunset
and
lasts
till
either
the
sun
is
high
or
whilst
the
clouds
are
still
aglow
with
the
rays
streaming
above
the
horizon
at
first
there
is
a
sort
of
negative
condition
as
if
some
tie
were
loosened
and
then
the
absolute
freedom
quickly
follows
when
however
the
freedom
ceases
the
changeback
or
relapse
comes
quickly
preceded
only
by
a
spell
of
warning
silence
tonight
when
we
met
she
was
somewhat
constrained
and
bore
all
the
signs
of
an
internal
struggle
i
put
it
down
myself
to
her
making
a
violent
effort
at
the
earliest
instant
she
could
do
so
a
very
few
minutes
however
gave
her
complete
control
of
herself
then
motioning
her
husband
to
sit
beside
her
on
the
sofa
where
she
was
half
reclining
she
made
the
rest
of
us
bring
chairs
up
close
taking
her
husbands
hand
in
hers
began
we
are
all
here
together
in
freedom
for
perhaps
the
last
time
i
know
dear
i
know
that
you
will
always
be
with
me
to
the
end
this
was
to
her
husband
whose
hand
had
as
we
could
see
tightened
upon
hers
in
the
morning
we
go
out
upon
our
task
and
god
alone
knows
what
may
be
in
store
for
any
of
us
you
are
going
to
be
so
good
to
me
as
to
take
me
with
you
i
know
that
all
that
brave
earnest
men
can
do
for
a
poor
weak
woman
whose
soul
perhaps
is
lostno
no
not
yet
but
is
at
any
rate
at
stakeyou
will
do
but
you
must
remember
that
i
am
not
as
you
are
there
is
a
poison
in
my
blood
in
my
soul
which
may
destroy
me
which
must
destroy
me
unless
some
relief
comes
to
us
oh
my
friends
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
my
soul
is
at
stake
and
though
i
know
there
is
one
way
out
for
me
you
must
not
and
i
must
not
take
it
she
looked
appealingly
to
us
all
in
turn
beginning
and
ending
with
her
husband
what
is
that
way
asked
van
helsing
in
a
hoarse
voice
what
is
that
way
which
we
must
notmay
nottake
that
i
may
die
now
either
by
my
own
hand
or
that
of
another
before
the
greater
evil
is
entirely
wrought
i
know
and
you
know
that
were
i
once
dead
you
could
and
would
set
free
my
immortal
spirit
even
as
you
did
my
poor
lucys
were
death
or
the
fear
of
death
the
only
thing
that
stood
in
the
way
i
would
not
shrink
to
die
here
now
amidst
the
friends
who
love
me
but
death
is
not
all
i
cannot
believe
that
to
die
in
such
a
case
when
there
is
hope
before
us
and
a
bitter
task
to
be
done
is
gods
will
therefore
i
on
my
part
give
up
here
the
certainty
of
eternal
rest
and
go
out
into
the
dark
where
may
be
the
blackest
things
that
the
world
or
the
nether
world
holds
we
were
all
silent
for
we
knew
instinctively
that
this
was
only
a
prelude
the
faces
of
the
others
were
set
and
harkers
grew
ashen
grey
perhaps
he
guessed
better
than
any
of
us
what
was
coming
she
continued
this
is
what
i
can
give
into
the
hotchpot
i
could
not
but
note
the
quaint
legal
phrase
which
she
used
in
such
a
place
and
with
all
seriousness
what
will
each
of
you
give
your
lives
i
know
she
went
on
quickly
that
is
easy
for
brave
men
your
lives
are
gods
and
you
can
give
them
back
to
him
but
what
will
you
give
to
me
she
looked
again
questioningly
but
this
time
avoided
her
husbands
face
quincey
seemed
to
understand
he
nodded
and
her
face
lit
up
then
i
shall
tell
you
plainly
what
i
want
for
there
must
be
no
doubtful
matter
in
this
connection
between
us
now
you
must
promise
me
one
and
alleven
you
my
beloved
husbandthat
should
the
time
come
you
will
kill
me
what
is
that
time
the
voice
was
quinceys
but
it
was
low
and
strained
when
you
shall
be
convinced
that
i
am
so
changed
that
it
is
better
that
i
die
than
i
may
live
when
i
am
thus
dead
in
the
flesh
then
you
will
without
a
moments
delay
drive
a
stake
through
me
and
cut
off
my
head
or
do
whatever
else
may
be
wanting
to
give
me
rest
quincey
was
the
first
to
rise
after
the
pause
he
knelt
down
before
her
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
said
solemnly
im
only
a
rough
fellow
who
hasnt
perhaps
lived
as
a
man
should
to
win
such
a
distinction
but
i
swear
to
you
by
all
that
i
hold
sacred
and
dear
that
should
the
time
ever
come
i
shall
not
flinch
from
the
duty
that
you
have
set
us
and
i
promise
you
too
that
i
shall
make
all
certain
for
if
i
am
only
doubtful
i
shall
take
it
that
the
time
has
come
my
true
friend
was
all
she
could
say
amid
her
fastfalling
tears
as
bending
over
she
kissed
his
hand
i
swear
the
same
my
dear
madam
mina
said
van
helsing
and
i
said
lord
godalming
each
of
them
in
turn
kneeling
to
her
to
take
the
oath
i
followed
myself
then
her
husband
turned
to
her
waneyed
and
with
a
greenish
pallor
which
subdued
the
snowy
whiteness
of
his
hair
and
asked
and
must
i
too
make
such
a
promise
oh
my
wife
you
too
my
dearest
she
said
with
infinite
yearning
of
pity
in
her
voice
and
eyes
you
must
not
shrink
you
are
nearest
and
dearest
and
all
the
world
to
me
our
souls
are
knit
into
one
for
all
life
and
all
time
think
dear
that
there
have
been
times
when
brave
men
have
killed
their
wives
and
their
womenkind
to
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
their
hands
did
not
falter
any
the
more
because
those
that
they
loved
implored
them
to
slay
them
it
is
mens
duty
towards
those
whom
they
love
in
such
times
of
sore
trial
and
oh
my
dear
if
it
is
to
be
that
i
must
meet
death
at
any
hand
let
it
be
at
the
hand
of
him
that
loves
me
best
dr
van
helsing
i
have
not
forgotten
your
mercy
in
poor
lucys
case
to
him
who
lovedshe
stopped
with
a
flying
blush
and
changed
her
phraseto
him
who
had
best
right
to
give
her
peace
if
that
time
shall
come
again
i
look
to
you
to
make
it
a
happy
memory
of
my
husbands
life
that
it
was
his
loving
hand
which
set
me
free
from
the
awful
thrall
upon
me
again
i
swear
came
the
professors
resonant
voice
mrs
harker
smiled
positively
smiled
as
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
leaned
back
and
said
and
now
one
word
of
warning
a
warning
which
you
must
never
forget
this
time
if
it
ever
come
may
come
quickly
and
unexpectedly
and
in
such
case
you
must
lose
no
time
in
using
your
opportunity
at
such
a
time
i
myself
might
benay
if
the
time
ever
comes
shall
beleagued
with
your
enemy
against
you
one
more
request
she
became
very
solemn
as
she
said
this
it
is
not
vital
and
necessary
like
the
other
but
i
want
you
to
do
one
thing
for
me
if
you
will
we
all
acquiesced
but
no
one
spoke
there
was
no
need
to
speak
i
want
you
to
read
the
burial
service
she
was
interrupted
by
a
deep
groan
from
her
husband
taking
his
hand
in
hers
she
held
it
over
her
heart
and
continued
you
must
read
it
over
me
some
day
whatever
may
be
the
issue
of
all
this
fearful
state
of
things
it
will
be
a
sweet
thought
to
all
or
some
of
us
you
my
dearest
will
i
hope
read
it
for
then
it
will
be
in
your
voice
in
my
memory
for
evercome
what
may
but
oh
my
dear
one
he
pleaded
death
is
afar
off
from
you
nay
she
said
holding
up
a
warning
hand
i
am
deeper
in
death
at
this
moment
than
if
the
weight
of
an
earthly
grave
lay
heavy
upon
me
oh
my
wife
must
i
read
it
he
said
before
he
began
it
would
comfort
me
my
husband
was
all
she
said
and
he
began
to
read
when
she
had
got
the
book
ready
how
can
ihow
could
any
onetell
of
that
strange
scene
its
solemnity
its
gloom
its
sadness
its
horror
and
withal
its
sweetness
even
a
sceptic
who
can
see
nothing
but
a
travesty
of
bitter
truth
in
anything
holy
or
emotional
would
have
been
melted
to
the
heart
had
he
seen
that
little
group
of
loving
and
devoted
friends
kneeling
round
that
stricken
and
sorrowing
lady
or
heard
the
tender
passion
of
her
husbands
voice
as
in
tones
so
broken
with
emotion
that
often
he
had
to
pause
he
read
the
simple
and
beautiful
service
from

the

on
the

of
the

to
paris
the

night
and
took
the
places
secured
for
us
in
the
orient

we
travelled
night
and
day
arriving
here
at
about
five
oclock
lord
godalming
went
to
the
consulate
to
see
if
any
telegram
had
arrived
for
him
whilst
the
rest
of
us
came
on
to
this

odessus
the
journey
may
have
had
incidents
i
was
however
too
eager
to
get
on
to
care
for
them
until
the
czarina
catherine
comes
into

thank
god
mina
is
well
and
looks
to
be
getting
stronger
her
colour
is
coming
back
she
sleeps
a
great
deal
throughout
the
journey
she
slept
nearly
all
the
time
before
sunrise
and
sunset
however
she
is
very
wakeful
and
alert
and
it
has
become
a
habit
for
van
helsing
to
hypnotise
her
at
such
times
at
first
some
effort
was
needed
and
he
had
to
make
many
passes
but
now
she
seems
to
yield
at
once
as
if
by
habit
and
scarcely
any
action
is
needed
he
seems
to
have
power
at
these
particular
moments
to
simply
will
and
her
thoughts
obey
him
he
always
asks
her
what
she
can
see
and
hear
she
answers
to
the
first
nothing
all
is
dark
and
to
the
second
i
can
hear
the
waves
lapping
against
the
ship
and
the
water
rushing
by
canvas
and
cordage
strain
and
masts
and
yards
creak
the
wind
is
highi
can
hear
it
in
the
shrouds
and
the
bow
throws
back
the
foam
it
is
evident
that
the
czarina
catherine
is
still
at
sea
hastening
on
her
way
to
varna
lord
godalming
has
just
returned
he
had
four
telegrams
one
each
day
since
we
started
and
all
to
the
same
effect
that
the
czarina
catherine
had
not
been
reported
to
lloyds
from
anywhere
he
had
arranged
before
leaving
london
that
his
agent
should
send
him
every
day
a
telegram
saying
if
the
ship
had
been
reported
he
was
to
have
a
message
even
if
she
were
not
reported
so
that
he
might
be
sure
that
there
was
a
watch
being
kept
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
we
had
dinner
and
went
to
bed
early
tomorrow
we
are
to
see
the
viceconsul
and
to
arrange
if
we
can
about
getting
on
board
the
ship
as
soon
as
she
arrives
van
helsing
says
that
our
chance
will
be
to
get
on
the
boat
between
sunrise
and
sunset
the
count
even
if
he
takes
the
form
of
a
bat
cannot
cross
the
running
water
of
his
own
volition
and
so
cannot
leave
the
ship
as
he
dare
not
change
to
mans
form
without
suspicionwhich
he
evidently
wishes
to
avoidhe
must
remain
in
the
box
if
then
we
can
come
on
board
after
sunrise
he
is
at
our
mercy
for
we
can
open
the
box
and
make
sure
of
him
as
we
did
of
poor
lucy
before
he
wakes
what
mercy
he
shall
get
from
us
will
not
count
for
much
we
think
that
we
shall
not
have
much
trouble
with
officials
or
the
seamen
thank
god
this
is
the
country
where
bribery
can
do
anything
and
we
are
well
supplied
with
money
we
have
only
to
make
sure
that
the
ship
cannot
come
into
port
between
sunset
and
sunrise
without
our
being
warned
and
we
shall
be
safe
judge
moneybag
will
settle
this
case

17
octobereverything
is
pretty
well
fixed
now
i
think
to
welcome
the
count
on
his
return
from
his
tour
godalming
told
the
shippers
that
he
fancied
that
the
box
sent
aboard
might
contain
something
stolen
from
a
friend
of
his
and
got
a
half
consent
that
he
might
open
it
at
his
own
risk
the
owner
gave
him
a
paper
telling
the
captain
to
give
him
every
facility
in
doing
whatever
he
chose
on
board
the
ship
and
also
a
similar
authorisation
to
his
agent
at
varna
we
have
seen
the
agent
who
was
much
impressed
with
godalmings
kindly
manner
to
him
and
we
are
all
satisfied
that
whatever
he
can
do
to
aid
our
wishes
will
be
done
we
have
already
arranged
what
to
do
in
case
we
get
the
box
open
if
the
count
is
there
van
helsing
and
seward
will
cut
off
his
head
at
once
and
drive
a
stake
through
his
heart
morris
and
godalming
and
i
shall
prevent
interference
even
if
we
have
to
use
the
arms
which
we
shall
have
ready
the
professor
says
that
if
we
can
so
treat
the
counts
body
it
will
soon
after
fall
into
dust
in
such
case
there
would
be
no
evidence
against
us
in
case
any
suspicion
of
murder
were
aroused
but
even
if
it
were
not
we
should
stand
or
fall
by
our
act
and
perhaps
some
day
this
very
script
may
be
evidence
to
come
between
some
of
us
and
a
rope
for
myself
i
should
take
the
chance
only
too
thankfully
if
it
were
to
come
we
mean
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
carry
out
our
intent
we
have
arranged
with
certain
officials
that
the
instant
the
czarina
catherine
is
seen
we
are
to
be
informed
by
a
special

i

with
a

is
irksome
to
me
but
van
helsing
says
i
must
we
were
all
wild
with
excitement
yesterday
when
godalming
got
his
telegram
from
lloyds
i
know
now
what
men
feel
in
battle
when
the
call
to
action
is
heard
mrs
harker
alone
of
our
party
did
not
show
any
signs
of
emotion
after
all
it
is
not
strange
that
she
did
not
for
we
took
special
care
not
to
let
her
know
anything
about
it
and
we
all
tried
not
to
show
any
excitement
when
we
were
in
her
presence
in
old
days
she
would
i
am
sure
have
noticed
no
matter
how
we
might
have
tried
to
conceal
it
but
in
this
way
she
is
greatly
changed
during
the
past
three
weeks
the
lethargy
grows
upon
her
and
though
she
seems
strong
and
well
and
is
getting
back
some
of
her
colour
van
helsing
and
i
are
not
satisfied
we
talk
of
her
often
we
have
not
however
said
a
word
to
the
others
it
would
break
poor
harkers
heartcertainly
his
nerveif
he
knew
that
we
had
even
a
suspicion
on
the
subject
van
helsing
examines
he
tells
me
her
teeth
very
carefully
whilst
she
is
in
the
hypnotic
condition
for
he
says
that
so
long
as
they
do
not
begin
to
sharpen
there
is
no
active
danger
of
a
change
in
her
if
this
change
should
come
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
steps
we
both
know
what
those
steps
would
have
to
be
though
we
do
not
mention
our
thoughts
to
each
other
we
should
neither
of
us
shrink
from
the
taskawful
though
it
be
to
contemplate
euthanasia
is
an
excellent
and
a
comforting
word
i
am
grateful
to
whoever
invented
it
it
is
only
about
24
hours
sail
from
the
dardanelles
to
here
at
the
rate
the
czarina
catherine
has
come
from
london
she
should
therefore
arrive
some
time
in
the
morning
but
as
she
cannot
possibly
get
in
before
then
we
are
all
about
to
retire
early
we
shall
get
up
at
one
oclock
so
as
to
be
ready

noonno
news
yet
of
the
ships
arrival
mrs
harkers
hypnotic
report
this
morning
was
the
same
as
usual
so
it
is
possible
that
we
may
get
news
at
any
moment
we
men
are
all
in
a
fever
of
excitement
except
harker
who
is
calm
his
hands
are
cold
as
ice
and
an
hour
ago
i
found
him
whetting
the
edge
of
the
great
ghoorka
knife
which
he
now
always
carries
with
him
it
will
be
a
bad
lookout
for
the
count
if
the
edge
of
that
kukri
ever
touches
his
throat
driven
by
that
stern
icecold
hand
van
helsing
and
i
were
a
little
alarmed
about
mrs
harker
today
about
noon
she
got
into
a
sort
of
lethargy
which
we
did
not
like
although
we
kept
silence
to
the
others
we
were
neither
of
us
happy
about
it
she
had
been
restless
all
the
morning
so
that
we
were
at
first
glad
to
know
that
she
was
sleeping
when
however
her
husband
mentioned
casually
that
she
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
he
could
not
wake
her
we
went
to
her
room
to
see
for
ourselves
she
was
breathing
naturally
and
looked
so
well
and
peaceful
that
we
agreed
that
the
sleep
was
better
for
her
than
anything
else
poor
girl
she
has
so
much
to
forget
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
sleep
if
it
brings
oblivion
to
her
does
her
good





laterour
opinion
was
justified
for
when
after
a
refreshing
sleep
of
some
hours
she
woke
up
she
seemed
brighter
and
better
than
she
had
been
for
days
at
sunset
she
made
the
usual
hypnotic
report
wherever
he
may
be
in
the
black
sea
the
count
is
hurrying
to
his
destination
to
his
doom
i
trust





26
octoberanother
day
and
no
tidings
of
the
czarina
catherine
she
ought
to
be
here
by
now
that
she
is
still
journeying
somewhere
is
apparent
for
mrs
harkers
hypnotic
report
at
sunrise
was
still
the
same
it
is
possible
that
the
vessel
may
be
lying
by
at
times
for
fog
some
of
the
steamers
which
came
in
last
evening
reported
patches
of
fog
both
to
north
and
south
of
the
port
we
must
continue
our
watching
as
the
ship
may
now
be
signalled
any
moment





27

noonmost
strange
no
news
yet
of
the
ship
we
wait
for
mrs
harker
reported
last
night
and
this
morning
as
usual
lapping
waves
and
rushing
water
though
she
added
that
the
waves
were
very
faint
the
telegrams
from
london
have
been
the
same
no
further
report
van
helsing
is
terribly
anxious
and
told
me
just
now
that
he
fears
the
count
is
escaping
us
he
added
significantly
i
did
not
like
that
lethargy
of
madam
minas
souls
and
memories
can
do
strange
things
during

i
was
about
to
ask
him
more
but
harker
just
then
came
in
and
he
held
up
a
warning
hand
we
must
try
tonight
at
sunset
to
make
her
speak
more
fully

28
octoberwhen
the
telegram
came
announcing
the
arrival
in
galatz
i
do
not
think
it
was
such
a
shock
to
any
of
us
as
might
have
been
expected
true
we
did
not
know
whence
or
how
or
when
the
bolt
would
come
but
i
think
we
all
expected
that
something
strange
would
happen
the
delay
of
arrival
at
varna
made
us
individually
satisfied
that
things
would
not
be
just
as
we
had
expected
we
only
waited
to
learn
where
the
change
would
occur
none
the
less
however
was
it
a
surprise
i
suppose
that
nature
works
on
such
a
hopeful
basis
that
we
believe
against
ourselves
that
things
will
be
as
they
ought
to
be
not
as
we
should
know
that
they
will
be

to

it
was
an
odd
experience
and
we
all
took
it
differently
van
helsing
raised
his
hand
over
his
head
for
a
moment
as
though
in
remonstrance
with
the
almighty
but
he
said
not
a
word
and
in
a
few
seconds
stood
up
with
his
face
sternly
set
lord
godalming
grew
very
pale
and
sat
breathing
heavily
i
was
myself
half
stunned
and
looked
in
wonder
at
one
after
another
quincey
morris
tightened
his
belt
with
that
quick
movement
which
i
knew
so
well
in
our
old
wandering
days
it
meant
action
mrs
harker
grew
ghastly
white
so
that
the
scar
on
her
forehead
seemed
to
burn
but
she
folded
her
hands
meekly
and
looked
up
in
prayer
harker
smiledactually
smiledthe
dark
bitter
smile
of
one
who
is
without
hope
but
at
the
same
time
his
action
belied
his
words
for
his
hands
instinctively
sought
the
hilt
of
the
great
kukri
knife
and
rested
there
when
does
the
next
train
start
for
galatz
said
van
helsing
to
us
generally
at
630
tomorrow
morning
we
all
started
for
the
answer
came
from
mrs
harker
how
on
earth
do
you
know
said
art
you
forgetor
perhaps
you
do
not
know
though
jonathan
does
and
so
does
dr
van
helsingthat
i
am
the
train
fiend
at
home
in
exeter
i
always
used
to
make
up
the
timetables
so
as
to
be
helpful
to
my
husband
i
found
it
so
useful
sometimes
that
i
always
make
a
study
of
the
timetables
now
i
knew
that
if
anything
were
to
take
us
to
castle
dracula
we
should
go
by
galatz
or
at
any
rate
through
bucharest
so
i
learned
the
times
very
carefully
unhappily
there
are
not
many
to
learn
as
the
only
train
tomorrow
leaves
as
i
say
wonderful
woman
murmured
the
professor
cant
we
get
a
special
asked
lord
godalming
van
helsing
shook
his
head
i
fear
not
this
land
is
very
different
from
yours
or
mine
even
if
we
did
have
a
special
it
would
probably
not
arrive
as
soon
as
our
regular
train
moreover
we
have
something
to
prepare
we
must
think
now
let
us
organize
you
friend
arthur
go
to
the
train
and
get
the
tickets
and
arrange
that
all
be
ready
for
us
to
go
in
the
morning
do
you
friend
jonathan
go
to
the
agent
of
the
ship
and
get
from
him
letters
to
the
agent
in
galatz
with
authority
to
make
search
the
ship
just
as
it
was
here
morris
quincey
you
see
the
viceconsul
and
get
his
aid
with
his
fellow
in
galatz
and
all
he
can
do
to
make
our
way
smooth
so
that
no
times
be
lost
when
over
the
danube
john
will
stay
with
madam
mina
and
me
and
we
shall
consult
for
so
if
time
be
long
you
may
be
delayed
and
it
will
not
matter
when
the
sun
set
since
i
am
here
with
madam
to
make
report
and
i
said
mrs
harker
brightly
and
more
like
her
old
self
than
she
had
been
for
many
a
long
day
shall
try
to
be
of
use
in
all
ways
and
shall
think
and
write
for
you
as
i
used
to
do
something
is
shifting
from
me
in
some
strange
way
and
i
feel
freer
than
i
have
been
of
late
the
three
younger
men
looked
happier
at
the
moment
as
they
seemed
to
realise
the
significance
of
her
words
but
van
helsing
and
i
turning
to
each
other
met
each
a
grave
and
troubled
glance
we
said
nothing
at
the
time
however
when
the
three
men
had
gone
out
to
their
tasks
van
helsing
asked
mrs
harker
to
look
up
the
copy
of
the
diaries
and
find
him
the
part
of
harkers
journal
at
the
castle
she
went
away
to
get
it
when
the
door
was
shut
upon
her
he
said
to
me
we
mean
the
same
speak
out
there
is
some
change
it
is
a
hope
that
makes
me
sick
for
it
may
deceive
us
quite
so
do
you
know
why
i
asked
her
to
get
the
manuscript
no
said
i
unless
it
was
to
get
an
opportunity
of
seeing
me
alone
you
are
in
part
right
friend
john
but
only
in
part
i
want
to
tell
you
something
and
oh
my
friend
i
am
taking
a
greata
terriblerisk
but
i
believe
it
is
right
in
the
moment
when
madam
mina
said
those
words
that
arrest
both
our
understanding
an
inspiration
came
to
me
in
the
trance
of
three
days
ago
the
count
sent
her
his
spirit
to
read
her
mind
or
more
like
he
took
her
to
see
him
in
his
earthbox
in
the
ship
with
water
rushing
just
as
it
go
free
at
rise
and
set
of
sun
he
learn
then
that
we
are
here
for
she
have
more
to
tell
in
her
open
life
with
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
than
he
shut
as
he
is
in
his
coffinbox
now
he
make
his
most
effort
to
escape
us
at
present
he
want
her
not
he
is
sure
with
his
so
great
knowledge
that
she
will
come
at
his
call
but
he
cut
her
offtake
her
as
he
can
do
out
of
his
own
power
that
so
she
come
not
to
him
ah
there
i
have
hope
that
our
manbrains
that
have
been
of
man
so
long
and
that
have
not
lost
the
grace
of
god
will
come
higher
than
his
childbrain
that
lie
in
his
tomb
for
centuries
that
grow
not
yet
to
our
stature
and
that
do
only
work
selfish
and
therefore
small
here
comes
madam
mina
not
a
word
to
her
of
her
trance
she
know
it
not
and
it
would
overwhelm
her
and
make
despair
just
when
we
want
all
her
hope
all
her
courage
when
most
we
want
all
her
great
brain
which
is
trained
like
mans
brain
but
is
of
sweet
woman
and
have
a
special
power
which
the
count
give
her
and
which
he
may
not
take
away
altogetherthough
he
think
not
so
hush
let
me
speak
and
you
shall
learn
oh
john
my
friend
we
are
in
awful
straits
i
fear
as
i
never
feared
before
we
can
only
trust
the
good
god
silence
here
she
comes
i
thought
that
the
professor
was
going
to
break
down
and
have
hysterics
just
as
he
had
when
lucy
died
but
with
a
great
effort
he
controlled
himself
and
was
at
perfect
nervous
poise
when
mrs
harker
tripped
into
the
room
bright
and
happylooking
and
in
the
doing
of
work
seemingly
forgetful
of
her
misery
as
she
came
in
she
handed
a
number
of
sheets
of
typewriting
to
van
helsing
he
looked
over
them
gravely
his
face
brightening
up
as
he
read
then
holding
the
pages
between
his
finger
and
thumb
he
said
friend
john
to
you
with
so
much
of
experience
alreadyand
you
too
dear
madam
mina
that
are
younghere
is
a
lesson
do
not
fear
ever
to
think
a
halfthought
has
been
buzzing
often
in
my
brain
but
i
fear
to
let
him
loose
his
wings
here
now
with
more
knowledge
i
go
back
to
where
that
halfthought
come
from
and
i
find
that
he
be
no
halfthought
at
all
that
be
a
whole
thought
though
so
young
that
he
is
not
yet
strong
to
use
his
little
wings
nay
like
the
ugly
duck
of
my
friend
hans
andersen
he
be
no
duckthought
at
all
but
a
big
swanthought
that
sail
nobly
on
big
wings
when
the
time
come
for
him
to
try
them
see
i
read
here
what
jonathan
have
written
that
other
of
his
race
who
in
a
later
age
again
and
again
brought
his
forces
over
the
great
river
into
turkey
land
who
when
he
was
beaten
back
came
again
and
again
and
again
though
he
had
to
come
alone
from
the
bloody
field
where
his
troops
were
being
slaughtered
since
he
knew
that
he
alone
could
ultimately
triumph
what
does
this
tell
us
not
much
no
the
counts
childthought
see
nothing
therefore
he
speak
so
free
your
manthought
see
nothing
my
manthought
see
nothing
till
just
now
no
but
there
comes
another
word
from
some
one
who
speak
without
thought
because
she
too
know
not
what
it
meanwhat
it
might
mean
just
as
there
are
elements
which
rest
yet
when
in
natures
course
they
move
on
their
way
and
they
touchthen
pouf
and
there
comes
a
flash
of
light
heaven
wide
that
blind
and
kill
and
destroy
some
but
that
show
up
all
earth
below
for
leagues
and
leagues
is
it
not
so
well
i
shall
explain
to
begin
have
you
ever
study
the
philosophy
of
crime
yes
and
no
you
john
yes
for
it
is
a
study
of
insanity
you
no
madam
mina
for
crime
touch
you
notnot
but
once
still
your
mind
works
true
and
argues
not
a
particulari
ad
universale
there
is
this
peculiarity
in
criminals
it
is
so
constant
in
all
countries
and
at
all
times
that
even
police
who
know
not
much
from
philosophy
come
to
know
it
empirically
that
it
is
that
is
to
be
empiric
the
criminal
always
work
at
one
crimethat
is
the
true
criminal
who
seems
predestinate
to
crime
and
who
will
of
none
other
this
criminal
has
not
full
manbrain
he
is
clever
and
cunning
and
resourceful
but
he
be
not
of
manstature
as
to
brain
he
be
of
childbrain
in
much
now
this
criminal
of
ours
is
predestinate
to
crime
also
he
too
have
childbrain
and
it
is
of
the
child
to
do
what
he
have
done
the
little
bird
the
little
fish
the
little
animal
learn
not
by
principle
but
empirically
and
when
he
learn
to
do
then
there
is
to
him
the
ground
to
start
from
to
do
more
dos
pou
sto
said
archimedes
give
me
a
fulcrum
and
i
shall
move
the
world
to
do
once
is
the
fulcrum
whereby
childbrain
become
manbrain
and
until
he
have
the
purpose
to
do
more
he
continue
to
do
the
same
again
every
time
just
as
he
have
done
before
oh
my
dear
i
see
that
your
eyes
are
opened
and
that
to
you
the
lightning
flash
show
all
the
leagues
for
mrs
harker
began
to
clap
her
hands
and
her
eyes
sparkled
he
went
on
now
you
shall
speak
tell
us
two
dry
men
of
science
what
you
see
with
those
so
bright
eyes
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
whilst
she
spoke
his
finger
and
thumb
closed
on
her
pulse
as
i
thought
instinctively
and
unconsciously
as
she
spoke
the
count
is
a
criminal
and
of
criminal
type
nordau
and
lombroso
would
so
classify
him
and
qu
criminal
he
is
of
imperfectly
formed
mind
thus
in
a
difficulty
he
has
to
seek
resource
in
habit
his
past
is
a
clue
and
the
one
page
of
it
that
we
knowand
that
from
his
own
lipstells
that
once
before
when
in
what
mr
morris
would
call
a
tight
place
he
went
back
to
his
own
country
from
the
land
he
had
tried
to
invade
and
thence
without
losing
purpose
prepared
himself
for
a
new
effort
he
came
again
better
equipped
for
his
work
and
won
so
he
came
to
london
to
invade
a
new
land
he
was
beaten
and
when
all
hope
of
success
was
lost
and
his
existence
in
danger
he
fled
back
over
the
sea
to
his
home
just
as
formerly
he
had
fled
back
over
the
danube
from
turkey
land
good
good
oh
you
so
clever
lady
said
van
helsing
enthusiastically
as
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
hand
a
moment
later
he
said
to
me
as
calmly
as
though
we
had
been
having
a
sickroom
consultation
seventytwo
only
and
in
all
this
excitement
i
have
hope
turning
to
her
again
he
said
with
keen
expectation
but
go
on
go
on
there
is
more
to
tell
if
you
will
be
not
afraid
john
and
i
know
i
do
in
any
case
and
shall
tell
you
if
you
are
right
speak
without
fear
i
will
try
to
but
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
seem
egotistical
nay
fear
not
you
must
be
egotist
for
it
is
of
you
that
we
think
then
as
he
is
criminal
he
is
selfish
and
as
his
intellect
is
small
and
his
action
is
based
on
selfishness
he
confines
himself
to
one
purpose
that
purpose
is
remorseless
as
he
fled
back
over
the
danube
leaving
his
forces
to
be
cut
to
pieces
so
now
he
is
intent
on
being
safe
careless
of
all
so
his
own
selfishness
frees
my
soul
somewhat
from
the
terrible
power
which
he
acquired
over
me
on
that
dreadful
night
i
felt
it
oh
i
felt
it
thank
god
for
his
great
mercy
my
soul
is
freer
than
it
has
been
since
that
awful
hour
and
all
that
haunts
me
is
a
fear
lest
in
some
trance
or
dream
he
may
have
used
my
knowledge
for
his
ends
the
professor
stood
up
he
has
so
used
your
mind
and
by
it
he
has
left
us
here
in
varna
whilst
the
ship
that
carried
him
rushed
through
enveloping
fog
up
to
galatz
where
doubtless
he
had
made
preparation
for
escaping
from
us
but
his
childmind
only
saw
so
far
and
it
may
be
that
as
ever
is
in
gods
providence
the
very
thing
that
the
evildoer
most
reckoned
on
for
his
selfish
good
turns
out
to
be
his
chiefest
harm
the
hunter
is
taken
in
his
own
snare
as
the
great
psalmist
says
for
now
that
he
think
he
is
free
from
every
trace
of
us
all
and
that
he
has
escaped
us
with
so
many
hours
to
him
then
his
selfish
childbrain
will
whisper
him
to
sleep
he
think
too
that
as
he
cut
himself
off
from
knowing
your
mind
there
can
be
no
knowledge
of
him
to
you
there
is
where
he
fail
that
terrible
baptism
of
blood
which
he
give
you
makes
you
free
to
go
to
him
in
spirit
as
you
have
as
yet
done
in
your
times
of
freedom
when
the
sun
rise
and
set
at
such
times
you
go
by
my
volition
and
not
by
his
and
this
power
to
good
of
you
and
others
as
you
have
won
from
your
suffering
at
his
hands
this
is
now
all
the
more
precious
that
he
know
it
not
and
to
guard
himself
have
even
cut
himself
off
from
his
knowledge
of
our
where
we
however
are
not
selfish
and
we
believe
that
god
is
with
us
through
all
this
blackness
and
these
many
dark
hours
we
shall
follow
him
and
we
shall
not
flinch
even
if
we
peril
ourselves
that
we
become
like
him
friend
john
this
has
been
a
great
hour
and
it
have
done
much
to
advance
us
on
our
way
you
must
be
scribe
and
write
him
all
down
so
that
when
the
others
return
from
their
work
you
can
give
it
to
them
then
they
shall
know
as
we
do
and
so
i
have
written
it
whilst
we
wait
their
return
and
mrs

diary
29
octoberthis
is
written
in
the
train
from
varna
to
galatz
last
night
we
all
assembled
a
little
before
the
time
of
sunset
each
of
us
had
done
his
work
as
well
as
he
could
so
far
as
thought
and
endeavour
and
opportunity
go
we
are
prepared
for
the
whole
of
our
journey
and
for
our
work
when
we
get
to
galatz
when
the
usual
time
came
round
mrs
harker
prepared
herself
for
her
hypnotic
effort
and
after
a
longer
and
more
serious
effort
on
the
part
of
van
helsing
than
has
been
usually
necessary
she
sank
into
the
trance
usually
she
speaks
on
a
hint
but
this
time
the
professor
had
to
ask
her
questions
and
to
ask
them
pretty
resolutely
before
we
could
learn
anything
at
last
her
answer
came
i
can
see
nothing
we
are
still
there
are
no
waves
lapping
but
only
a
steady
swirl
of
water
softly
running
against
the
hawser
i
can
hear
mens
voices
calling
near
and
far
and
the
roll
and
creak
of
oars
in
the
rowlocks
a
gun
is
fired
somewhere
the
echo
of
it
seems
far
away
there
is
tramping
of
feet
overhead
and
ropes
and
chains
are
dragged
along
what
is
this
there
is
a
gleam
of
light
i
can
feel
the
air
blowing
upon
me
here
she
stopped
she
had
risen
as
if
impulsively
from
where
she
lay
on
the
sofa
and
raised
both
her
hands
palms
upwards
as
if
lifting
a
weight
van
helsing
and
i
looked
at
each
other
with
understanding
quincey
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
and
looked
at
her
intently
whilst
harkers
hand
instinctively
closed
round
the
hilt
of
his
kukri
there
was
a
long
pause
we
all
knew
that
the
time
when
she
could
speak
was
passing
but
we
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
say
anything
suddenly
she
sat
up
and
as
she
opened
her
eyes
said
sweetly
would
none
of
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
you
must
all
be
so
tired
we
could
only
make
her
happy
and
so
acquiesced
she
bustled
off
to
get
tea
when
she
had
gone
van
helsing
said
you
see
my
friends
he
is
close
to
land
he
has
left
his
earthchest
but
he
has
yet
to
get
on
shore
in
the
night
he
may
lie
hidden
somewhere
but
if
he
be
not
carried
on
shore
or
if
the
ship
do
not
touch
it
he
cannot
achieve
the
land
in
such
case
he
can
if
it
be
in
the
night
change
his
form
and
can
jump
or
fly
on
shore
as
he
did
at
whitby
but
if
the
day
come
before
he
get
on
shore
then
unless
he
be
carried
he
cannot
escape
and
if
he
be
carried
then
the
customs
men
may
discover
what
the
box
contain
thus
in
fine
if
he
escape
not
on
shore
tonight
or
before
dawn
there
will
be
the
whole
day
lost
to
him
we
may
then
arrive
in
time
for
if
he
escape
not
at
night
we
shall
come
on
him
in
daytime
boxed
up
and
at
our
mercy
for
he
dare
not
be
his
true
self
awake
and
visible
lest
he
be
discovered
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
so
we
waited
in
patience
until
the
dawn
at
which
time
we
might
learn
more
from
mrs
harker
early
this
morning
we
listened
with
breathless
anxiety
for
her
response
in
her
trance
the
hypnotic
stage
was
even
longer
in
coming
than
before
and
when
it
came
the
time
remaining
until
full
sunrise
was
so
short
that
we
began
to
despair
van
helsing
seemed
to
throw
his
whole
soul
into
the
effort
at
last
in
obedience
to
his
will
she
made
reply
all
is
dark
i
hear
lapping
water
level
with
me
and
some
creaking
as
of
wood
on
wood
she
paused
and
the
red
sun
shot
up
we
must
wait
till
tonight
and
so
it
is
that
we
are
travelling
towards
galatz
in
an
agony
of
expectation
we
are
due
to
arrive
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
but
already
at
bucharest
we
are
three
hours
late
so
we
cannot
possibly
get
in
till
well
after
sunup
thus
we
shall
have
two
more
hypnotic
messages
from
mrs
harker
either
or
both
may
possibly
throw
more
light
on
what
is
happening





latersunset
has
come
and
gone
fortunately
it
came
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
distraction
for
had
it
occurred
whilst
we
were
at
a
station
we
might
not
have
secured
the
necessary
calm
and
isolation
mrs
harker
yielded
to
the
hypnotic
influence
even
less
readily
than
this
morning
i
am
in
fear
that
her
power
of
reading
the
counts
sensations
may
die
away
just
when
we
want
it
most
it
seems
to
me
that
her
imagination
is
beginning
to
work
whilst
she
has
been
in
the
trance
hitherto
she
has
confined
herself
to
the
simplest
of
facts
if
this
goes
on
it
may
ultimately
mislead
us
if
i
thought
that
the
counts
power
over
her
would
die
away
equally
with
her
power
of
knowledge
it
would
be
a
happy
thought
but
i
am
afraid
that
it
may
not
be
so
when
she
did
speak
her
words
were
enigmatical
something
is
going
out
i
can
feel
it
pass
me
like
a
cold
wind
i
can
hear
far
off
confused
soundsas
of
men
talking
in
strange
tongues
fiercefalling
water
and
the
howling
of
wolves
she
stopped
and
a
shudder
ran
through
her
increasing
in
intensity
for
a
few
seconds
till
at
the
end
she
shook
as
though
in
a
palsy
she
said
no
more
even
in
answer
to
the
professors
imperative
questioning
when
she
woke
from
the
trance
she
was
cold
and
exhausted
and
languid
but
her
mind
was
all
alert
she
could
not
remember
anything
but
asked
what
she
had
said
when
she
was
told
she
pondered
over
it
deeply
for
a
long
time
and
in
silence

a
mwe
are
near
galatz
now
and
i
may
not
have
time
to
write
later
sunrise
this
morning
was
anxiously
looked
for
by
us
all
knowing
of
the
increasing
difficulty
of
procuring
the
hypnotic
trance
van
helsing
began
his
passes
earlier
than
usual
they
produced
no
effect
however
until
the
regular
time
when
she
yielded
with
a
still
greater
difficulty
only
a
minute
before
the
sun
rose
the
professor
lost
no
time
in
his
questioning
her
answer
came
with
equal
quickness
all
is
dark
i
hear
water
swirling
by
level
with
my
ears
and
the
creaking
of
wood
on
wood
cattle
low
far
off
there
is
another
sound
a
queer
one
like
she
stopped
and
grew
white
and
whiter
still
go
on
go
on
speak
i
command
you
said
van
helsing
in
an
agonised
voice
at
the
same
time
there
was
despair
in
his
eyes
for
the
risen
sun
was
reddening
even
mrs
harkers
pale
face
she
opened
her
eyes
and
we
all
started
as
she
said
sweetly
and
seemingly
with
the
utmost
unconcern
oh
professor
why
ask
me
to
do
what
you
know
i
cant
i
dont
remember
anything
then
seeing
the
look
of
amazement
on
our
faces
she
said
turning
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
troubled
look
what
have
i
said
what
have
i
done
i
know
nothing
only
that
i
was
lying
here
half
asleep
and
heard
you
say
go
on
speak
i
command
you
it
seemed
so
funny
to
hear
you
order
me
about
as
if
i
were
a
bad
child
oh
madam
mina
he
said
sadly
it
is
proof
if
proof
be
needed
of
how
i
love
and
honour
you
when
a
word
for
your
good
spoken
more
earnest
than
ever
can
seem
so
strange
because
it
is
to
order
her
whom
i
am
proud
to
obey
the
whistles
are
sounding
we
are
nearing
galatz
we
are
on
fire
with
anxiety
and
eagerness

me
to
the

being
the
one
who
could
best
be
spared
since
he
does
not
speak
any
foreign

the
forces
were
distributed
much
as
they
had
been
at
varna
except
that
lord
godalming
went
to
the
viceconsul
as
his
rank
might
serve
as
an
immediate
guarantee
of
some
sort
to
the
official
we

in
extreme

jonathan

had

from
london

to
lord

telegraphed
request
asking
us
to
show
them
any
civility
in
their
power
they
were
more
than
kind
and
courteous
and
took
us
at
once
on
board
the
czarina
catherine
which
lay
at
anchor
out
in
the
river

there
we
saw
the
captain
donelson
by
name
who
told
us
of
his
voyage

said
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
had
so
favourable
a
run

he
said
but
it
made
us
afeard
for
we
expeckit
that
we
should
have
to
pay
for
it
wi
some
rare
piece
o
ill
luck

on
us

had
lifted

more
clever

some
and
he

when
he
meet
his

the
skipper
was
not
displeased
with
the
compliment
and
went
on
when
we
got
past
the
bosphorus
the
men
began
to
grumble
some
o
them
the
roumanians
came
and
asked
me
to
heave
overboard
a
big
box
which
had
been
put
on
board
by
a
queer
lookin
old
man
just
before
we
had
started
frae
london
i
had
seen
them
speer
at
the
fellow
and
put
out
their
twa
fingers
when
they
saw
him
to
guard
against
the
evil
eye
man
but
the
supersteetion
of
foreigners
is
pairfectly
rideeculous
i
sent
them
aboot
their
business
pretty
quick
but
as
just
after
a
fog
closed
in
on
us
i
felt
a
wee
bit
as
they
did
anent
something
though
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
agin
the
big
box
well
on
we
went
and
as
the
fog
didnt
let
up
for
five
days
i
joost
let
the
wind
carry
us
for
if
the
deil
wanted
to
get
somewhereswell
he
would
fetch
it
up
areet

if
he
didnt
well

keep
a
sharp
lookout
anyhow

had
a
fair
way
and
deep
water
all
the
time
and
two
days
ago
when
the
mornin
sun
came
through
the
fog
we
found
ourselves
just
in
the
river
opposite
galatz
the
roumanians
were
wild
and
wanted
me
right
or
wrong
to
take
out
the
box
and
fling
it
in
the
river
i
had
to
argy
wi
them
aboot
it
wi
a
handspike
an
when
the
last
o
them
rose
off
the
deck
wi
his
head
in
his
hand
i
had
convinced
them
that
evil
eye
or
no
evil
eye
the
property
and
the
trust
of
my
owners
were
better
in
my
hands
than
in
the
river
danube
they
had
mind
ye
taken
the
box
on
the
deck
ready
to
fling
in
and
as
it
was
marked
galatz
via
varna
i
thocht
id
let
it
lie
till
we
discharged
in
the
port
an
get
rid
ot
althegither
we
didnt
do
much
clearin
that
day
an
had
to
remain
the
nicht
at
anchor
but
in
the
mornin
braw
an
airly
an
hour
before
sunup
a
man
came
aboard
wi
an
order
written
to
him
from
england
to
receive
a
box
marked
for
one
count
dracula
sure
eneuch
the
matter
was
one
ready
to
his
hand
he
had
his
papers
a
reet
an
glad
i
was
to
be
rid
o
the
dam
thing
for
i
was
beginnin
masel
to
feel
uneasy
at
it
if
the
deil
did
have
any
luggage
aboord
the
ship
im
thinkin
it
was
nane
ither
than
that
same
what
was
the
name
of
the
man
who
took
it
asked
dr
van
helsing
with
restrained
eagerness
ill
be
tellin
ye
quick
he
answered
and
stepping
down
to
his
cabin
produced
a
receipt
signed
immanuel
hildesheim
burgenstrasse
16
was
the
address
we
found
out
that
this
was
all
the
captain
knew
so
with
thanks
we
came
away
we
found
hildesheim
in
his
office
a
hebrew
of
rather
the
adelphi
theatre
type
with
a
nose
like
a
sheep
and
a
fez
his
arguments
were
pointed
with
speciewe
doing
the
punctuationand
with
a
little
bargaining
he
told
us
what
he
knew
this
turned
out
to
be
simple
but
important
he
had
received
a
letter
from
mr
de
ville
of
london
telling
him
to
receive
if
possible
before
sunrise
so
as
to
avoid
customs
a
box
which
would
arrive
at
galatz
in
the
czarina
catherine
this
he
was
to
give
in
charge
to
a
certain
petrof
skinsky
who
dealt
with
the
slovaks
who
traded
down
the
river
to
the
port
he
had
been
paid
for
his
work
by
an
english
bank
note
which
had
been
duly
cashed
for
gold
at
the
danube
international
bank
when
skinsky
had
come
to
him
he
had
taken
him
to
the
ship
and
handed
over
the
box
so
as
to
save
porterage
that
was
all
he
knew
we
then
sought
for
skinsky
but
were
unable
to
find
him
one
of
his
neighbours
who
did
not
seem
to
bear
him
any
affection
said
that
he
had
gone
away
two
days
before
no
one
knew
whither
this
was
corroborated
by
his
landlord
who
had
received
by
messenger
the
key
of
the
house
together
with
the
rent
due
in
english
money
this
had
been
between
ten
and
eleven
oclock
last
night
we
were
at
a
standstill
again
whilst
we
were
talking
one
came
running
and
breathlessly
gasped
out
that
the
body
of
skinsky
had
been
found
inside
the
wall
of
the
churchyard
of
st
peter
and
that
the
throat
had
been
torn
open
as
if
by
some
wild
animal
those
we
had
been
speaking
with
ran
off
to
see
the
horror
the
women
crying
out
this
is
the
work
of
a
slovak
we
hurried
away
lest
we
should
have
been
in
some
way
drawn
into
the
affair
and
so
detained
as
we
came
home
we
could
arrive
at
no
definite
conclusion
we
were
all
convinced
that
the
box
was
on
its
way
by
water
to
somewhere
but
where
that
might
be
we
would
have
to
discover
with
heavy
hearts
we
came
home
to
the
hotel
to
mina
when
we
met
together
the
first
thing
was
to
consult
as
to
taking
mina
again
into
our
confidence
things
are
getting
desperate
and
it
is
at
least
a
chance
though
a
hazardous
one
as
a
preliminary
step
i
was
released
from
my
promise
to
her
mina
harkers
journal
30
october
eveningthey
were
so
tired
and
worn
out
and
dispirited
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
till
they
had
some
rest
so
i
asked
them
all
to
lie
down
for
half
an
hour
whilst
i
should
enter
everything
up
to
the
moment
i
feel
so
grateful
to
the
man
who
invented
the
travellers
typewriter
and
to
mr
morris
for
getting
this
one
for
me
i
should
have
felt
quite
astray
doing
the
work
if
i
had
to
write
with
a
pen

is
all
done

he
must

suffered
what
must
he
be
suffering
now
he
lies
on
the
sofa
hardly
seeming
to
breathe
and
his
whole
body
appears
in
collapse
his
brows
are
knit
his
face
is
drawn
with
pain
poor
fellow
maybe
he
is
thinking
and
i
can
see
his
face
all
wrinkled
up
with
the
concentration
of
his
thoughts
oh
if
i
could
only
help
at
all
i
shall
do
what
i
can
i
have
asked
dr
van
helsing
and
he
has
got
me
all
the
papers
that
i
have
not
yet
seen
whilst
they
are
resting
i
shall
go
over
all
carefully
and
perhaps
i
may
arrive
at
some
conclusion
i
shall
try
to
follow
the
professors
example
and
think
without
prejudice
on
the
facts
before
me





i
do
believe
that
under
gods
providence
i
have
made
a
discovery
i
shall
get
the
maps
and
look
over
them





i
am
more
than
ever
sure
that
i
am
right
my
new
conclusion
is
ready
so
i
shall
get
our
party
together
and
read
it
they
can
judge
it
it
is

to
be

by

is
the
safest
way
in
one
respect
but
with
most
danger
in
another
on
the
water
he
is
powerless
except
at
night
even
then
he
can
only
summon
fog
and
storm
and
snow
and
his
wolves
but
were
he
wrecked
the
living
water
would
engulf
him
helpless
and
he
would
indeed
be
lost
he
could
have
the
vessel
drive
to
land
but
if
it
were
unfriendly
land
wherein
he
was
not
free
to
move
his
position
would
still
be
desperate
we
know
from
the
record
that
he
was
on
the
water
so
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
ascertain
what
water
the
first
thing
is
to
realise
exactly
what
he
has
done
as
yet
we
may
then
get
a
light
on
what
his
later
task
is
to
be
firstlywe
must
differentiate
between
what
he
did
in
london
as
part
of
his
general
plan
of
action
when
he
was
pressed
for
moments
and
had
to
arrange
as
best
he
could
secondly
we
must
see
as
well
as
we
can
surmise
it
from
the
facts
we
know
of
what
he
has
done
here
as
to
the
first
he
evidently
intended
to
arrive
at
galatz
and
sent
invoice
to
varna
to
deceive
us
lest
we
should
ascertain
his
means
of
exit
from
england
his
immediate
and
sole
purpose
then
was
to
escape
the
proof
of
this
is
the
letter
of
instructions
sent
to
immanuel
hildesheim
to
clear
and
take
away
the
box
before
sunrise
there
is
also
the
instruction
to
petrof
skinsky
these
we
must
only
guess
at
but
there
must
have
been
some
letter
or
message
since
skinsky
came
to
hildesheim
that
so
far
his
plans
were
successful
we
know
the
czarina
catherine
made
a
phenomenally
quick
journeyso
much
so
that
captain
donelsons
suspicions
were
aroused
but
his
superstition
united
with
his
canniness
played
the
counts
game
for
him
and
he
ran
with
his
favouring
wind
through
fogs
and
all
till
he
brought
up
blindfold
at
galatz
that
the
counts
arrangements
were
well
made
has
been
proved
hildesheim
cleared
the
box
took
it
off
and
gave
it
to
skinsky
skinsky
took
itand
here
we
lose
the
trail
we
only
know
that
the
box
is
somewhere
on
the
water
moving
along
the
customs
and
the
octroi
if
there
be
any
have
been
avoided
now
we
come
to
what
the
count
must
have
done
after
his
arrivalon
land
at
galatz
the
box
was
given
to
skinsky
before
sunrise
at
sunrise
the
count
could
appear
in
his
own
form
here
we
ask
why
skinsky
was
chosen
at
all
to
aid
in
the
work
in
my
husbands
diary
skinsky
is
mentioned
as
dealing
with
the
slovaks
who
trade
down
the
river
to
the
port
and
the
mans
remark
that
the
murder
was
the
work
of
a
slovak
showed
the
general
feeling
against
his
class
the
count
wanted
isolation
my
surmise
is
this
that
in
london
the
count
decided
to
get
back
to
his
castle
by
water
as
the
most
safe
and
secret
way
he
was
brought
from
the
castle
by
szgany
and
probably
they
delivered
their
cargo
to
slovaks
who
took
the
boxes
to
varna
for
there
they
were
shipped
for
london
thus
the
count
had
knowledge
of
the
persons
who
could
arrange
this
service
when
the
box
was
on
land
before
sunrise
or
after
sunset
he
came
out
from
his
box
met
skinsky
and
instructed
him
what
to
do
as
to
arranging
the
carriage
of
the
box
up
some
river
when
this
was
done
and
he
knew
that
all
was
in
train
he
blotted
out
his
traces
as
he
thought
by
murdering
his
agent
i
have
examined
the
map
and
find
that
the
river
most
suitable
for
the
slovaks
to
have
ascended
is
either
the
pruth
or
the
sereth
i
read
in
the
typescript
that
in
my
trance
i
heard
cows
low
and
water
swirling
level
with
my
ears
and
the
creaking
of
wood
the
count
in
his
box
then
was
on
a
river
in
an
open
boatpropelled
probably
either
by
oars
or
poles
for
the
banks
are
near
and
it
is
working
against
stream
there
would
be
no
such
sound
if
floating
down
stream
of
course
it
may
not
be
either
the
sereth
or
the
pruth
but
we
may
possibly
investigate
further
now
of
these
two
the
pruth
is
the
more
easily
navigated
but
the
sereth
is
at
fundu
joined
by
the
bistritza
which
runs
up
round
the
borgo
pass
the
loop
it
makes
is
manifestly
as
close
to

when
i
had
done
reading
jonathan
took
me
in
his
arms

kissed
me
the
others
kept
shaking
me
by
both
hands

dr

said
our
dear
madam
mina
is
once
more
our
teacher
her
eyes
have
been
where
we
were
blinded
now
we
are
on
the
track
once
again
and
this
time
we
may
succeed
our
enemy
is
at
his
most
helpless
and
if
we
can
come
on
him
by
day
on
the
water
our
task
will
be
over
he
has
a
start
but
he
is
powerless
to
hasten
as
he
may
not
leave
his
box
lest
those
who
carry
him
may
suspect
for
them
to
suspect
would
be
to
prompt
them
to
throw
him
in
the
stream
where
he
perish
this
he
knows
and
will
not
now
men
to
our
council
of
war
for
here
and
now
we
must
plan
what
each
and
all
shall
do
i
shall
get
a
steam
launch
and
follow
him
said
lord
godalming

i
horses
to
follow
on
the
bank
lest
by
chance
he
land
said
mr
morris
good
said
the
professor
both
good
but
neither
must
go
alone
there
must
be
force
to
overcome
force
if
need
be
the
slovak
is
strong
and
rough
and
he
carries
rude
arms
all
the
men
smiled
for
amongst
them
they
carried
a
small
arsenal
said
mr
morris
i
have
brought
some
winchesters
they
are
pretty
handy
in
a
crowd
and
there
may
be
wolves
the
count
if
you
remember
took
some
other
precautions
he
made
some
requisitions
on
others
that
mrs
harker
could
not
quite
hear
or
understand
we
must
be
ready
at
all
points
dr
seward
said
i
think
i
had
better
go
with
quincey
we
have
been
accustomed
to
hunt
together
and
we
two
well
armed
will
be
a
match
for
whatever
may
come
along
you
must
not
be
alone
art
it
may
be
necessary
to
fight
the
slovaks
and
a
chance
thrustfor
i
dont
suppose
these
fellows
carry
gunswould
undo
all
our
plans
there
must
be
no
chances
this
time
we
shall
not
rest
until
the
counts
head
and
body
have
been
separated
and
we
are
sure
that
he
cannot
reincarnate
he
looked
at
jonathan
as
he
spoke
and
jonathan
looked
at
me
i
could
see
that
the
poor
dear
was
torn
about
in
his
mind
of
course
he
wanted
to
be
with
me
but
then
the
boat
service
would
most
likely
be
the
one
which
would
destroy
the

the

the

vampire
why
did
i
hesitate
to
write
the
word
he
was
silent
awhile
and
during
his
silence
dr
van
helsing
spoke
friend
jonathan
this
is
to
you
for
twice
reasons
first
because
you
are
young
and
brave
and
can
fight
and
all
energies
may
be
needed
at
the
last
and
again
that
it
is
your
right
to
destroy
himthatwhich
has
wrought
such
woe
to
you
and
yours
be
not
afraid
for
madam
mina
she
will
be
my
care
if
i
may
i
am
old
my
legs
are
not
so
quick
to
run
as
once
and
i
am
not
used
to
ride
so
long
or
to
pursue
as
need
be
or
to
fight
with
lethal
weapons
but
i
can
be
of
other
service
i
can
fight
in
other
way
and
i
can
die
if
need
be
as
well
as
younger
men
now
let
me
say
that
what
i
would
is
this
while
you
my
lord
godalming
and
friend
jonathan
go
in
your
so
swift
little
steamboat
up
the
river
and
whilst
john
and
quincey
guard
the
bank
where
perchance
he
might
be
landed
i
will
take
madam
mina
right
into
the
heart
of
the
enemys
country
whilst
the
old
fox
is
tied
in
his
box
floating
on
the
running
stream
whence
he
cannot
escape
to
landwhere
he
dares
not
raise
the
lid
of
his
coffinbox
lest
his
slovak
carriers
should
in
fear
leave
him
to
perishwe
shall
go
in
the
track
where
jonathan
wentfrom
bistritz
over
the
borgo
and
find
our
way
to
the
castle
of
dracula
here
madam
minas
hypnotic
power
will
surely
help
and
we
shall
find
our
wayall
dark
and
unknown
otherwiseafter
the
first
sunrise
when
we
are
near
that
fateful
place
there
is
much
to
be
done
and
other
places
to
be
made
sanctify
so
that
that
nest
of
vipers
be
obliterated
here
jonathan
interrupted
him
hotly
do
you
mean
to
say
professor
van
helsing
that
you
would
bring
mina
in
her
sad
case
and
tainted
as
she
is
with
that
devils
illness
right
into
the
jaws
of
his
deathtrap
not
for
the
world
not
for
heaven
or
hell
he
became
almost
speechless
for
a
minute
and
then
went
on
do
you
know
what
the
place
is
have
you
seen
that
awful
den
of
hellish
infamywith
the
very
moonlight
alive
with
grisly
shapes
and
every
speck
of
dust
that
whirls
in
the
wind
a
devouring
monster
in
embryo
have
you
felt
the
vampires
lips
upon
your
throat
here
he
turned
to
me
and
as
his
eyes
lit
on
my
forehead
he
threw
up
his
arms
with
a
cry
oh
my
god
what
have
we
done
to
have
this
terror
upon
us
and
he
sank
down
on
the
sofa
in
a
collapse
of
misery
the
professors
voice
as
he
spoke
in
clear
sweet
tones
which
seemed
to
vibrate
in
the
air
calmed
us
all
oh
my
friend
it
is
because
i
would
save
madam
mina
from
that
awful
place
that
i
would
go
god
forbid
that
i
should
take
her
into
that
place
there
is
workwild
workto
be
done
there
that
her
eyes
may
not
see
we
men
here
all
save
jonathan
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
what
is
to
be
done
before
that
place
can
be
purify
remember
that
we
are
in
terrible
straits
if
the
count
escape
us
this
timeand
he
is
strong
and
subtle
and
cunninghe
may
choose
to
sleep
him
for
a
century
and
then
in
time
our
dear
onehe
took
my
handwould
come
to
him
to
keep
him
company
and
would
be
as
those
others
that
you
jonathan
saw
you
have
told
us
of
their
gloating
lips
you
heard
their
ribald
laugh
as
they
clutched
the
moving
bag
that
the
count
threw
to
them
you
shudder
and
well
may
it
be
forgive
me
that
i
make
you
so
much
pain
but
it
is
necessary
my
friend
is
it
not
a
dire
need
for
the
which
i
am
giving
possibly
my
life
if
it
were
that
any
one
went
into
that
place
to
stay
it
is
i
who
would
have
to
go
to
keep
them
company
do
as
you
will
said
jonathan
with
a
sob
that
shook
him
all
over
we
are
in
the
hands
of
god





lateroh
it
did
me
good
to
see
the
way
that
these
brave
men
worked
how
can
women
help
loving
men
when
they
are
so
earnest
and
so
true
and
so
brave
and
too
it
made
me
think
of
the
wonderful
power
of
money
what
can
it
not
do
when
it
is
properly
applied
and
what
might
it
do
when
basely
used
i
felt
so
thankful
that
lord
godalming
is
rich
and
that
both
he
and
mr
morris
who
also
has
plenty
of
money
are
willing
to
spend
it
so
freely
for
if
they
did
not
our
little
expedition
could
not
start
either
so
promptly
or
so
well
equipped
as
it
will
within
another
hour
it
is
not
three
hours
since
it
was
arranged
what
part
each
of
us
was
to
do
and
now
lord
godalming
and
jonathan
have
a
lovely
steam

money
as
we
are
to
buy
a
carriage
and
horses

we

no
one
whom
we
can
trust

nighti
am
writing
this
in
the
light
from
the
furnace
door
of
the
steam
launch
lord
godalming
is
firing
up
he
is
an
experienced
hand
at
the
work
as
he
has
had
for
years
a
launch
of
his
own
on
the
thames
and
another
on
the
norfolk
broads
regarding
our
plans
we
finally
decided
that
minas
guess
was
correct
and
that
if
any
waterway
was
chosen
for
the
counts
escape
back
to
his
castle
the
sereth
and
then
the
bistritza
at
its
junction
would
be
the
one
we
took
it
that
somewhere
about
the
47th
degree
north
latitude
would
be
the
place
chosen
for
the
crossing
the
country
between
the
river
and
the
carpathians
we
have
no
fear
in
running
at
good
speed
up
the
river
at
night
there
is
plenty
of
water
and
the
banks
are
wide
enough
apart
to
make
steaming
even
in
the
dark
easy
enough
lord
godalming
tells
me
to
sleep
for
a
while
as
it
is
enough
for
the
present
for
one
to
be
on
watch
but
i
cannot
sleephow
can
i
with
the
terrible
danger
hanging
over
my
darling
and
her
going
out
into
that
awful
place
my
only
comfort
is
that
we
are
in
the
hands
of
god
only
for
that
faith
it
would
be
easier
to
die
than
to
live
and
so
be
quit
of
all
the
trouble
mr
morris
and
dr
seward
were
off
on
their
long
ride
before
we
started
they
are
to
keep
up
the
right
bank
far
enough
off
to
get
on
higher
lands
where
they
can
see
a
good
stretch
of
river
and
avoid
the
following
of
its
curves
they
have
for
the
first
stages
two
men
to
ride
and
lead
their
spare
horsesfour
in
all
so
as
not
to
excite
curiosity
when
they
dismiss
the
men
which
shall
be
shortly
they
shall
themselves
look
after
the
horses
it
may
be
necessary
for
us
to
join
forces
if
so
they
can
mount
our
whole

of

a
movable

and
can
be
easily
adapted

required
it
is
a
wild
adventure
we
are
on
here
as
we
are
rushing
along
through
the
darkness
with
the
cold
from
the
river
seeming
to
rise
up
and
strike
us
with
all
the
mysterious
voices
of
the
night
around
us
it
all
comes
home
we
seem
to
be
drifting
into
unknown
places
and
unknown
ways
into

dark

all
day
we
have
found
nothing
of
the
kind
we
seek
we
have
now
passed
into
the
bistritza
and
if
we
are
wrong
in
our
surmise
our
chance
is
gone
we
have
overhauled
every
boat
big
and
little
early
this
morning
one
crew
took
us
for
a
government
boat
and
treated
us
accordingly
we
saw
in
this
a
way
of
smoothing
matters
so
at
fundu
where
the
bistritza
runs
into
the
sereth
we
got
a
roumanian
flag
which
we
now
fly
conspicuously
with
every
boat
which
we
have
overhauled
since
then
this
trick
has
succeeded
we
have
had
every
deference
shown
to
us
and
not
once
any
objection
to
whatever
we
chose
to
ask
or
do
some
of
the
slovaks
tell
us
that
a
big
boat
passed
them
going
at
more
than
usual
speed
as
she
had
a
double
crew
on
board
this
was
before
they
came
to
fundu
so
they
could
not
tell
us
whether
the
boat
turned
into
the
bistritza
or
continued
on
up
the
sereth
at
fundu
we
could
not
hear
of
any
such
boat
so
she
must
have
passed
there
in
the
night
i
am
feeling
very
sleepy
the
cold
is
perhaps
beginning
to
tell
upon
me
and
nature
must
have
rest
some
time

morningit
is
broad
daylight
that
good
fellow
would
not
wake
me
he
says
it
would
have
been
a
sin
to
for
i
slept
peacefully
and
was
forgetting
my
trouble
it
seems
brutally
selfish
to
me
to
have
slept
so
long
and
let
him
watch
all
night
but
he
was
quite
right
i
am
a
new
man
this
morning
and
as
i
sit
here
and
watch
him
sleeping
i
can
do
all
that
is
necessary
both
as
to
minding
the
engine
steering
and
keeping
watch
i
can
feel
that
my
strength
and
energy
are
coming
back
to
me
i
wonder
where
mina
is
now
and
van
helsing
they
should
have
got
to
veresti
about
noon
on
wednesday
it
would
take
them
some
time
to
get
the
carriage
and
horses
so
if
they
had
started
and
travelled
hard
they
would
be
about
now
at
the
borgo
pass
god
guide
and
help
them
i
am
afraid
to
think
what
may
happen
if
we
could
only
go
faster
but
we
cannot
the
engines
are
throbbing
and
doing
their
utmost
i
wonder
how
dr
seward
and
mr
morris
are
getting
on
there
seem
to
be
endless
streams
running
down
the
mountains
into
this
river
but
as
none
of
them
are
very
largeat
present
at
all
events
though
they
are
terrible
doubtless
in
winter
and
when
the
snow
meltsthe
horsemen
may
not
have
met
much
obstruction
i
hope
that
before
we
get
to
strasba
we
may
see
them
for
if
by
that
time
we
have
not
overtaken
the
count
it
may
be
necessary
to
take
counsel
together
what
to
do

days
on

no

and
no
time
to
write
it
if
there
had
been
for
every
moment
is
precious
we
have
had
only
the
rest
needful
for
the
horses
but
we
are
both
bearing
it
wonderfully
those
adventurous
days
of
ours
are
turning
up
useful
we
must
push
on
we
shall
never
feel
happy
till
we
get
the
launch
in
sight
again





3
novemberwe
heard
at
fundu
that
the
launch
had
gone
up
the
bistritza
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
cold
there
are
signs
of
snow
coming
and
if
it
falls
heavy
it
will
stop
us
in
such
case
we
must
get
a
sledge
and
go
on
russian
fashion





4
novembertoday
we
heard
of
the
launch
having
been
detained
by
an
accident
when
trying
to
force
a
way
up
the
rapids
the
slovak
boats
get
up
all
right
by
aid
of
a
rope
and
steering
with
knowledge
some
went
up
only
a
few
hours
before
godalming
is
an
amateur
fitter
himself
and
evidently
it
was
he
who
put
the
launch
in
trim
again
finally
they
got
up
the
rapids
all
right
with
local
help
and
are
off
on
the
chase
afresh
i
fear
that
the
boat
is
not
any
better
for
the
accident
the
peasantry
tell
us
that
after
she
got
upon
smooth
water
again
she
kept
stopping
every
now
and
again
so
long
as
she
was
in
sight
we
must
push
on
harder
than
ever
our
help
may
be
wanted
soon

at
veresti
at
noon
the
professor
tells
me
that
this
morning
at
dawn
he
could
hardly
hypnotise
me
at
all
and
that
all
i
could
say
was
dark
and
quiet
he
is
off
now
buying
a
carriage
and
horses
he
says
that
he
will
later
on
try
to
buy
additional
horses
so
that
we
may
be
able
to
change
them
on
the
way
we
have
something
more
than
70
miles
before
us
the
country
is
lovely
and
most
interesting
if
only
we
were
under
different
conditions
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
see
it
all
if
jonathan
and
i
were
driving
through
it
alone
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
stop
and
see
people
and
learn
something
of
their
life
and
to
fill
our
minds
and
memories
with
all
the
colour
and
picturesqueness
of
the
whole
wild
beautiful
country
and
the
quaint
people
but
alas





laterdr
van
helsing
has
returned
he
has
got
the
carriage
and
horses
we
are
to
have
some
dinner
and
to
start
in
an
hour
the
landlady
is
putting
us
up
a
huge
basket
of
provisions
it
seems
enough
for
a
company
of
soldiers
the
professor
encourages
her
and
whispers
to
me
that
it
may
be
a
week
before
we
can
get
any
good
food
again
he
has
been
shopping
too
and
has
sent
home
such
a
wonderful
lot
of
fur
coats
and
wraps
and
all
sorts
of
warm
things
there
will
not
be
any
chance
of
our
being
cold





we
shall
soon
be
off
i
am
afraid
to
think
what
may
happen
to
us
we
are
truly
in
the
hands
of
god
he
alone
knows
what
may
be
and
i
pray
him
with
all
the
strength
of
my
sad
and
humble
soul
that
he
will
watch
over
my
beloved
husband
that
whatever
may
happen
jonathan
may
know
that
i
loved
him
and
honoured
him
more
than
i
can
say
and
that
my
latest
and
truest
thought
will
be
always
for
him

novemberall
day
long
we
have
travelled
and
at
a
good
speed
the
horses
seem
to
know
that
they
are
being
kindly
treated
for
they
go
willingly
their
full
stage
at
best
speed
we
have
now
had
so
many
changes
and
find
the
same
thing
so
constantly
that
we
are
encouraged
to
think
that
the
journey
will
be
an
easy
one
dr
van
helsing
is
laconic
he
tells
the
farmers
that
he
is
hurrying
to
bistritz
and
pays
them
well
to
make
the
exchange
of
horses
we
get
hot
soup
or
coffee
or
tea
and
off
we
go
it
is
a
lovely
country
full
of
beauties
of
all
imaginable
kinds
and
the
people
are
brave
and
strong
and
simple
and
seem
full
of
nice
qualities
they
are
very
very
superstitious
in
the
first
house
where
we
stopped
when
the
woman
who
served
us
saw
the
scar
on
my
forehead
she
crossed
herself
and
put
out
two
fingers
towards
me
to
keep
off
the
evil
eye
i
believe
they
went
to
the
trouble
of
putting
an
extra
amount
of
garlic
into
our
food
and
i
cant
abide
garlic
ever
since
then
i
have
taken
care
not
to
take
off
my
hat
or
veil
and
so
have
escaped
their
suspicions
we
are
travelling
fast
and
as
we
have
no
driver
with
us
to
carry
tales
we
go
ahead
of
scandal
but
i
daresay
that
fear
of
the
evil
eye
will
follow
hard
behind
us
all
the
way
the
professor
seems
tireless
all
day
he
would
not
take
any
rest
though
he
made
me
sleep
for
a
long
spell
at
sunset
time
he
hypnotised
me
and
he
says
that
i
answered
as
usual
darkness
lapping
water
and
creaking
wood
so
our
enemy
is
still
on
the
river
i
am
afraid
to
think
of
jonathan
but
somehow
i
have
now
no
fear
for
him
or
for
myself
i
write
this
whilst
we
wait
in
a
farmhouse
for
the
horses
to
be
got
ready
dr
van
helsing
is
sleeping
poor
dear
he
looks
very
tired
and
old
and
grey
but
his
mouth
is
set
as
firmly
as
a
conquerors
even
in
his
sleep
he
is
instinct
with
resolution
when
we
have
well
started
i
must
make
him
rest
whilst
i
drive
i
shall
tell
him
that
we
have
days
before
us
and
we
must
not
break
down
when
most
of
all
his
strength
will
be
needed
all
is
ready
we
are
off
shortly

all

now
the
day
is
on
us
bright
though
cold
there
is
a
strange
heaviness
in
the
airi
say
heaviness
for
want
of
a
better
word
i
mean
that
it
oppresses
us
both
it
is
very
cold
and
only
our
warm
furs
keep
us
comfortable
at
dawn

helsing
hypnotised

he
says
i
answered

creaking

and
roaring

so
the

is
changing
as
they
ascend
i
do
hope
that
my
darling
will
not
run
any
chance
of
dangermore
than
need
be

we
are
in

nightall
day
long
driving
the
country
gets
wilder
as
we
go
and
the
great
spurs
of
the
carpathians
which
at
veresti
seemed
so
far
from
us
and
so
low
on
the
horizon
now
seem
to
gather
round
us
and
tower
in
front
we
both
seem
in
good
spirits
i
think
we
make
an
effort
each
to
cheer
the
other
in
the
doing
so
we
cheer
ourselves
dr
van
helsing
says
that
by
morning
we
shall
reach
the
borgo
pass
the
houses
are
very
few
here
now
and
the
professor
says
that
the
last
horse
we
got
will
have
to
go
on
with
us
as
we
may
not
be
able
to
change
he
got
two
in
addition
to
the
two
we
changed
so
that
now
we
have
a
rude
fourinhand
the
dear
horses
are
patient
and
good
and
they
give
us
no
trouble
we
are
not
worried
with
other
travellers
and
so
even
i
can
drive
we
shall
get
to
the
pass
in
daylight
we
do
not
want
to
arrive
before
so
we
take
it
easy
and
have
each
a
long
rest
in
turn
oh
what
will
tomorrow
bring
to
us
we
go
to
seek
the
place
where
my
poor
darling
suffered
so
much
god
grant
that
we
may
be
guided
aright
and
that
he
will
deign
to
watch
over
my
husband
and
those
dear
to
us
both
and
who
are
in
such
deadly
peril
as
for
me
i
am
not
worthy
in
his
sight
alas
i
am
unclean
to
his
eyes
and
shall
be
until
he
may
deign
to
let
me
stand
forth
in
his
sight
as
one
of
those
who
have
not
incurred
his
wrath

lost
her
appetite
she
make
no
entry
into
her
little
diary
she
who
write
so
faithful
at
every
pause
something
whisper
to
me
that
all
is
not
well
however
tonight
she
is
more
vif
her
long
sleep
all
day
have
refresh
and
restore
her
for
now
she
is
all
sweet
and
bright
as
ever
at
sunset
i
try
to
hypnotise
her
but
alas
with
no
effect
the
power
has
grown
less
and
less
with
each
day
and
tonight
it
fail
me
altogether
well
gods
will
be
donewhatever
it
may
be
and
whithersoever
it
may
lead
now
to
the
historical
for
as
madam
mina
write
not
in
her
stenography
i
must
in
my
cumbrous
old
fashion
that
so
each
day
of
us
may
not
go
unrecorded
we
got
to
the
borgo
pass
just
after
sunrise
yesterday
morning
when
i
saw
the
signs
of
the
dawn
i
got
ready
for
the
hypnotism
we
stopped
our
carriage
and
got
down
so
that
there
might
be
no
disturbance
i
made
a
couch
with
furs
and
madam
mina
lying
down
yield
herself
as
usual
but
more
slow
and
more
short
time
than
ever
to
the
hypnotic
sleep
as
before
came
the
answer
darkness
and
the
swirling
of
water
then
she
woke
bright
and
radiant
and
we
go
on
our
way
and
soon
reach
the
pass
at
this
time
and
place
she
become
all
on
fire
with
zeal
some
new
guiding
power
be
in
her
manifested
for
she
point
to
a
road
and
say
this
is
the
way
how
know
you
it
i
ask
of
course
i
know
it
she
answer
and
with
a
pause
add
have
not
my
jonathan
travelled
it
and
wrote
of
his
travel
at
first
i
think
somewhat
strange
but
soon
i
see
that
there
be
only
one
such
byroad
it
is
used
but
little
and
very
different
from
the
coach
road
from
the
bukovina
to
bistritz
which
is
more
wide
and
hard
and
more
of
use
so
we
came
down
this
road
when
we
meet
other
waysnot
always
were
we
sure
that
they
were
roads
at
all
for
they
be
neglect
and
light
snow
have
fallenthe
horses
know
and
they
only
i
give
rein
to
them
and
they
go
on
so
patient
byandby
we
find
all
the
things
which
jonathan
have
note
in
that
wonderful
diary
of
him
then
we
go
on
for
long
long
hours
and
hours
at
the
first
i
tell
madam
mina
to
sleep
she
try
and
she
succeed
she
sleep
all
the
time
till
at
the
last
i
feel
myself
to
suspicious
grow
and
attempt
to
wake
her
but
she
sleep
on
and
i
may
not
wake
her
though
i
try
i
do
not
wish
to
try
too
hard
lest
i
harm
her
for
i
know
that
she
have
suffer
much
and
sleep
at
times
be
allinall
to
her
i
think
i
drowse
myself
for
all
of
sudden
i
feel
guilt
as
though
i
have
done
something
i
find
myself
bolt
up
with
the
reins
in
my
hand
and
the
good
horses
go
along
jog
jog
just
as
ever
i
look
down
and
find
madam
mina
still
sleep
it
is
now
not
far
off
sunset
time
and
over
the
snow
the
light
of
the
sun
flow
in
big
yellow
flood
so
that
we
throw
great
long
shadow
on
where
the
mountain
rise
so
steep
for
we
are
going
up
and
up
and
all
is
oh
so
wild
and
rocky
as
though
it
were
the
end
of
the
world
then
i
arouse
madam
mina
this
time
she
wake
with
not
much
trouble
and
then
i
try
to
put
her
to
hypnotic
sleep
but
she
sleep
not
being
as
though
i
were
not
still
i
try
and
try
till
all
at
once
i
find
her
and
myself
in
dark
so
i
look
round
and
find
that
the
sun
have
gone
down
madam
mina
laugh
and
i
turn
and
look
at
her
she
is
now
quite
awake
and
look
so
well
as
i
never
saw
her
since
that
night
at
carfax
when
we
first
enter
the
counts
house
i
am
amaze
and
not
at
ease
then
but
she
is
so
bright
and
tender
and
thoughtful
for
me
that
i
forget
all
fear
i
light
a
fire
for
we
have
brought
supply
of
wood
with
us
and
she
prepare
food
while
i
undo
the
horses
and
set
them
tethered
in
shelter
to
feed
then
when
i
return
to
the
fire
she
have
my
supper
ready
i
go
to
help
her
but
she
smile
and
tell
me
that
she
have
eat
alreadythat
she
was
so
hungry
that
she
would
not
wait
i
like
it
not
and
i
have
grave
doubts
but
i
fear
to
affright
her
and
so
i
am
silent
of
it
she
help
me
and
i
eat
alone
and
then
we
wrap
in
fur
and
lie
beside
the
fire
and
i
tell
her
to
sleep
while
i
watch
but
presently
i
forget
all
of
watching
and
when
i
sudden
remember
that
i
watch
i
find
her
lying
quiet
but
awake
and
looking
at
me
with
so
bright
eyes
once
twice
more
the
same
occur
and
i
get
much
sleep
till
before
morning
when
i
wake
i
try
to
hypnotise
her
but
alas
though
she
shut
her
eyes
obedient
she
may
not
sleep
the
sun
rise
up
and
up
and
up
and
then
sleep
come
to
her
too
late
but
so
heavy
that
she
will
not
wake
i
have
to
lift
her
up
and
place
her
sleeping
in
the
carriage
when
i
have
harnessed
the
horses
and
made
all
ready
madam
still
sleep
and
she
look
in
her
sleep
more
healthy
and
more
redder
than
before
and
i
like
it
not
and
i
am
afraid
afraid
afraidi
am
afraid
of
all
thingseven
to
think
but
i
must
go
on
my
way
the
stake
we
play
for

life
and
death

than
these

5
november
morninglet
me
be
accurate
in
everything
for
though
you
and
i
have
seen
some
strange
things
together
you
may
at
the
first
think
that
i
van
helsing
am
madthat
the
many
horrors
and
the
so
long
strain
on
nerves
has
at
the
last
turn
my
brain
all
yesterday
we
travel
ever
getting
closer
to
the
mountains
and
moving
into
a
more
and
more
wild
and
desert
land
there
are
great
frowning
precipices
and
much
falling
water
and
nature
seem
to
have
held
sometime
her
carnival
madam
mina
still
sleep
and
sleep
and
though
i
did
have
hunger
and
appeased
it
i
could
not
waken
hereven
for
food
i
began
to
fear
that
the
fatal
spell
of
the
place
was
upon
her
tainted
as
she
is
with
that
vampire
baptism
well
said
i
to
myself
if
it
be
that
she
sleep
all
the
day
it
shall
also
be
that
i
do
not
sleep
at
night
as
we
travel
on
the
rough
road
for
a
road
of
an
ancient
and
imperfect
kind
there
was
i
held
down
my
head
and
slept
again
i
waked
with
a
sense
of
guilt
and
of
time
passed
and
found
madam
mina
still
sleeping
and
the
sun
low
down
but
all
was
indeed
changed
the
frowning
mountains
seemed
further
away
and
we
were
near
the
top
of
a
steeprising
hill
on
summit
of
which
was
such
a
castle
as
jonathan
tell
of
in
his
diary
at
once
i
exulted
and
feared
for
now
for
good
or
ill
the
end
was
near
i
woke
madam
mina
and
again
tried
to
hypnotise
her
but
alas
unavailing
till
too
late
then
ere
the
great
dark
came
upon
usfor
even
after
downsun
the
heavens
reflected
the
gone
sun
on
the
snow
and
all
was
for
a
time
in
a
great
twilighti
took
out
the
horses
and
fed
them
in
what
shelter
i
could
then
i
make
a
fire
and
near
it
i
make
madam
mina
now
awake
and
more
charming
than
ever
sit
comfortable
amid
her
rugs
i
got
ready
food
but
she
would
not
eat
simply
saying
that
she
had
not
hunger
i
did
not
press
her
knowing
her
unavailingness
but
i
myself
eat
for
i
must
needs
now
be
strong
for
all
then
with
the
fear
on
me
of
what
might
be
i
drew
a
ring
so
big
for
her
comfort
round
where
madam
mina
sat
and
over
the
ring
i
passed
some
of
the
wafer
and
i
broke
it
fine
so
that
all
was
well
guarded
she
sat
still
all
the
timeso
still
as
one
dead
and
she
grew
whiter
and
ever
whiter
till
the
snow
was
not
more
pale
and
no
word
she
said
but
when
i
drew
near
she
clung
to
me
and
i
could
know
that
the
poor
soul
shook
her
from
head
to
feet
with
a
tremor
that
was
pain
to
feel
i
said
to
her
presently
when
she
had
grown
more
quiet
will
you
not
come
over
to
the
fire
for
i
wished
to
make
a
test
of
what
she
could
she
rose
obedient
but
when
she
have
made
a
step
she
stopped
and
stood
as
one
stricken
why
not
go
on
i
asked
she
shook
her
head
and
coming
back
sat
down
in
her
place
then
looking
at
me
with
open
eyes
as
of
one
waked
from
sleep
she
said
simply
i
cannot
and
remained
silent
i
rejoiced
for
i
knew
that
what
she
could
not
none
of
those
that
we
dreaded
could
though
there
might
be
danger
to
her
body
yet
her
soul
was
safe
presently
the
horses
began
to
scream
and
tore
at
their
tethers
till
i
came
to
them
and
quieted
them
when
they
did
feel
my
hands
on
them
they
whinnied
low
as
in
joy
and
licked
at
my
hands
and
were
quiet
for
a
time
many
times
through
the
night
did
i
come
to
them
till
it
arrive
to
the
cold
hour
when
all
nature
is
at
lowest
and
every
time
my
coming
was
with
quiet
of
them
in
the
cold
hour
the
fire
began
to
die
and
i
was
about
stepping
forth
to
replenish
it
for
now
the
snow
came
in
flying
sweeps
and
with
it
a
chill
mist
even
in
the
dark
there
was
a
light
of
some
kind
as
there
ever
is
over
snow
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
snowflurries
and
the
wreaths
of
mist
took
shape
as
of
women
with
trailing
garments
all
was
in
dead
grim
silence
only
that
the
horses
whinnied
and
cowered
as
if
in
terror
of
the
worst
i
began
to
fearhorrible
fears
but
then
came
to
me
the
sense
of
safety
in
that
ring
wherein
i
stood
i
began
too
to
think
that
my
imaginings
were
of
the
night
and
the
gloom
and
the
unrest
that
i
have
gone
through
and
all
the
terrible
anxiety
it
was
as
though
my
memories
of
all
jonathans
horrid
experience
were
befooling
me
for
the
snow
flakes
and
the
mist
began
to
wheel
and
circle
round
till
i
could
get
as
though
a
shadowy
glimpse
of
those
women
that
would
have
kissed
him
and
then
the
horses
cowered
lower
and
lower
and
moaned
in
terror
as
men
do
in
pain
even
the
madness
of
fright
was
not
to
them
so
that
they
could
break
away
i
feared
for
my
dear
madam
mina
when
these
weird
figures
drew
near
and
circled
round
i
looked
at
her
but
she
sat
calm
and
smiled
at
me
when
i
would
have
stepped
to
the
fire
to
replenish
it
she
caught
me
and
held
me
back
and
whispered
like
a
voice
that
one
hears
in
a
dream
so
low
it
was
no
no
do
not
go
without
here
you
are
safe
i
turned
to
her
and
looking
in
her
eyes
said
but
you
it
is
for
you
that
i
fear
whereat
she
laugheda
laugh
low
and
unreal
and
said
fear
for
me
why
fear
for
me
none
safer
in
all
the
world
from
them
than
i
am
and
as
i
wondered
at
the
meaning
of
her
words
a
puff
of
wind
made
the
flame
leap
up
and
i
see
the
red
scar
on
her
forehead
then
alas
i
knew
did
i
not
i
would
soon
have
learned
for
the
wheeling
figures
of
mist
and
snow
came
closer
but
keeping
ever
without
the
holy
circle
then
they
began
to
materialise
tillif
god
have
not
take
away
my
reason
for
i
saw
it
through
my
eyesthere
were
before
me
in
actual
flesh
the
same
three
women
that
jonathan
saw
in
the
room
when
they
would
have
kissed
his
throat
i
knew
the
swaying
round
forms
the
bright
hard
eyes
the
white
teeth
the
ruddy
colour
the
voluptuous
lips
they
smiled
ever
at
poor
dear
madam
mina
and
as
their
laugh
came
through
the
silence
of
the
night
they
twined
their
arms
and
pointed
to
her
and
said
in
those
so
sweet
tingling
tones
that
jonathan
said
were
of
the
intolerable
sweetness
of
the
waterglasses
come
sister
come
to
us
come
come
in
fear
i
turned
to
my
poor
madam
mina
and
my
heart
with
gladness
leapt
like
flame
for
oh
the
terror
in
her
sweet
eyes
the
repulsion
the
horror
told
a
story
to
my
heart
that
was
all
of
hope
god
be
thanked
she
was
not
yet
of
them
i
seized
some
of
the
firewood
which
was
by
me
and
holding
out
some
of
the
wafer
advanced
on
them
towards
the
fire
they
drew
back
before
me
and
laughed
their
low
horrid
laugh
i
fed
the
fire
and
feared
them
not
for
i
knew
that
we
were
safe
within
our
protections
they
could
not
approach
me
whilst
so
armed
nor
madam
mina
whilst
she
remained
within
the
ring
which
she
could
not
leave
no
more
than
they
could
enter
the
horses
had
ceased
to
moan
and
lay
still
on
the
ground
the
snow
fell
on
them
softly
and
they
grew
whiter
i
knew
that
there
was
for
the
poor
beasts
no
more
of
terror
and
so
we
remained
till
the
red
of
the
dawn
to
fall
through
the
snowgloom
i
was
desolate
and
afraid
and
full
of
woe
and
terror
but
when
that
beautiful
sun
began
to
climb
the
horizon
life
was
to
me
again
at
the
first
coming
of
the
dawn
the
horrid
figures
melted
in
the
whirling
mist
and
snow
the
wreaths
of
transparent
gloom
moved
away
towards
the
castle
and
were
lost
instinctively
with
the
dawn
coming
i
turned
to
madam
mina
intending
to
hypnotise
her
but
she
lay
in
a
deep
and
sudden
sleep
from
which
i
could
not
wake
her
i
tried
to
hypnotise
through
her
sleep
but
she
made
no
response
none
at
all
and
the
day
broke
i
fear
yet
to
stir
i
have
made
my
fire
and
have
seen
the
horses
they
are
all
dead
today
i
have
much
to
do
here
and
i
keep
waiting
till
the
sun
is
up
high
for
there
may
be
places
where
i
must
go
where
that
sunlight
though
snow
and
mist
obscure
it
will
be
to
me
a
safety
i
will
strengthen
me
with
breakfast
and
then
i
will
to
my
terrible
work
madam
mina
still
sleeps
and
god
be
thanked
she
is
calm
in
her
sleep

for
it
we

my

off

the

we
saw
the
body
of
szgany
before
us
dashing
away
from
the
river
with
their
leiterwagon
they
surrounded
it
in
a
cluster
and
hurried
along
as
though
beset
the
snow
is
falling
lightly
and
there
is
a
strange
excitement
in
the
air
it

be

the
depression
is
strange
far
off
i
hear
the
howling
of
wolves
the
snow
brings
them
down
from
the
mountains

there
are
dangers
to

the

november
afternooni
am
at
least
sane
thank
god
for
that
mercy
at
all
events
though
the
proving
it
has
been
dreadful
when
i
left
madam
mina
sleeping
within
the
holy
circle
i
took
my
way
to
the
castle
the
blacksmith
hammer
which
i
took
in
the
carriage
from
veresti
was
useful
though
the
doors
were
all
open
i
broke
them
off
the
rusty
hinges
lest
some
illintent
or
illchance
should
close
them
so
that
being
entered
i
might
not
get
out
jonathans
bitter
experience
served
me
here
by
memory
of
his
diary
i
found
my
way
to
the
old
chapel
for
i
knew
that
here
my
work
lay
the
air
was
oppressive
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
some
sulphurous
fume
which
at
times
made
me
dizzy
either
there
was
a
roaring
in
my
ears
or
i
heard
afar
off
the
howl
of
wolves
then
i
bethought
me
of
my
dear
madam
mina
and
i
was
in
terrible
plight
the
dilemma
had
me
between
his
horns
her
i
had
not
dare
to
take
into
this
place
but
left
safe
from
the
vampire
in
that
holy
circle
and
yet
even
there
would
be
the
wolf
i
resolve
me
that
my
work
lay
here
and
that
as
to
the
wolves
we
must
submit
if
it
were
gods
will
at
any
rate
it
was
only
death
and
freedom
beyond
so
did
i
choose
for
her
had
it
but
been
for
myself
the
choice
had
been
easy
the
maw
of
the
wolf
were
better
to
rest
in
than
the
grave
of
the
vampire
so
i
make
my
choice
to
go
on
with
my
work
i
knew
that
there
were
at
least
three
graves
to
findgraves
that
are
inhabit
so
i
search
and
search
and
i
find
one
of
them
she
lay
in
her
vampire
sleep
so
full
of
life
and
voluptuous
beauty
that
i
shudder
as
though
i
have
come
to
do
murder
ah
i
doubt
not
that
in
old
time
when
such
things
were
many
a
man
who
set
forth
to
do
such
a
task
as
mine
found
at
the
last
his
heart
fail
him
and
then
his
nerve
so
he
delay
and
delay
and
delay
till
the
mere
beauty
and
the
fascination
of
the
wanton
undead
have
hypnotise
him
and
he
remain
on
and
on
till
sunset
come
and
the
vampire
sleep
be
over
then
the
beautiful
eyes
of
the
fair
woman
open
and
look
love
and
the
voluptuous
mouth
present
to
a
kissand
man
is
weak
and
there
remain
one
more
victim
in
the
vampire
fold
one
more
to
swell
the
grim
and
grisly
ranks
of
the
undead
there
is
some
fascination
surely
when
i
am
moved
by
the
mere
presence
of
such
an
one
even
lying
as
she
lay
in
a
tomb
fretted
with
age
and
heavy
with
the
dust
of
centuries
though
there
be
that
horrid
odour
such
as
the
lairs
of
the
count
have
had
yes
i
was
movedi
van
helsing
with
all
my
purpose
and
with
my
motive
for
hatei
was
moved
to
a
yearning
for
delay
which
seemed
to
paralyse
my
faculties
and
to
clog
my
very
soul
it
may
have
been
that
the
need
of
natural
sleep
and
the
strange
oppression
of
the
air
were
beginning
to
overcome
me
certain
it
was
that
i
was
lapsing
into
sleep
the
openeyed
sleep
of
one
who
yields
to
a
sweet
fascination
when
there
came
through
the
snowstilled
air
a
long
low
wail
so
full
of
woe
and
pity
that
it
woke
me
like
the
sound
of
a
clarion
for
it
was
the
voice
of
my
dear
madam
mina
that
i
heard
then
i
braced
myself
again
to
my
horrid
task
and
found
by
wrenching
away
tombtops
one
other
of
the
sisters
the
other
dark
one
i
dared
not
pause
to
look
on
her
as
i
had
on
her
sister
lest
once
more
i
should
begin
to
be
enthrall
but
i
go
on
searching
until
presently
i
find
in
a
high
great
tomb
as
if
made
to
one
much
beloved
that
other
fair
sister
which
like
jonathan
i
had
seen
to
gather
herself
out
of
the
atoms
of
the
mist
she
was
so
fair
to
look
on
so
radiantly
beautiful
so
exquisitely
voluptuous
that
the
very
instinct
of
man
in
me
which
calls
some
of
my
sex
to
love
and
to
protect
one
of
hers
made
my
head
whirl
with
new
emotion
but
god
be
thanked
that
soulwail
of
my
dear
madam
mina
had
not
died
out
of
my
ears
and
before
the
spell
could
be
wrought
further
upon
me
i
had
nerved
myself
to
my
wild
work
by
this
time
i
had
searched
all
the
tombs
in
the
chapel
so
far
as
i
could
tell
and
as
there
had
been
only
three
of
these
undead
phantoms
around
us
in
the
night
i
took
it
that
there
were
no
more
of
active
undead
existent
there
was
one
great
tomb
more
lordly
than
all
the
rest
huge
it
was
and
nobly
proportioned
on
it
was
but
one
word
dracula
this
then
was
the
undead
home
of
the
kingvampire
to
whom
so
many
more
were
due
its
emptiness
spoke
eloquent
to
make
certain
what
i
knew
before
i
began
to
restore
these
women
to
their
dead
selves
through
my
awful
work
i
laid
in
draculas
tomb
some
of
the
wafer
and
so
banished
him
from
it
undead
for
ever
then
began
my
terrible
task
and
i
dreaded
it
had
it
been
but
one
it
had
been
easy
comparative
but
three
to
begin
twice
more
after
i
had
been
through
a
deed
of
horror
for
if
it
was
terrible
with
the
sweet
miss
lucy
what
would
it
not
be
with
these
strange
ones
who
had
survived
through
centuries
and
who
had
been
strengthened
by
the
passing
of
the
years
who
would
if
they
could
have
fought
for
their
foul
lives
oh
my
friend
john
but
it
was
butcher
work
had
i
not
been
nerved
by
thoughts
of
other
dead
and
of
the
living
over
whom
hung
such
a
pall
of
fear
i
could
not
have
gone
on
i
tremble
and
tremble
even
yet
though
till
all
was
over
god
be
thanked
my
nerve
did
stand
had
i
not
seen
the
repose
in
the
first
place
and
the
gladness
that
stole
over
it
just
ere
the
final
dissolution
came
as
realisation
that
the
soul
had
been
won
i
could
not
have
gone
further
with
my
butchery
i
could
not
have
endured
the
horrid
screeching
as
the
stake
drove
home
the
plunging
of
writhing
form
and
lips
of
bloody
foam
i
should
have
fled
in
terror
and
left
my
work
undone
but
it
is
over
and
the
poor
souls
i
can
pity
them
now
and
weep
as
i
think
of
them
placid
each
in
her
full
sleep
of
death
for
a
short
moment
ere
fading
for
friend
john
hardly
had
my
knife
severed
the
head
of
each
before
the
whole
body
began
to
melt
away
and
crumble
in
to
its
native
dust
as
though
the
death
that
should
have
come
centuries
agone
had
at
last
assert
himself
and
say
at
once
and
loud
i
am
here
before
i
left
the
castle
i
so
fixed
its
entrances
that
never
more
can
the
count
enter
there
undead
when
i
stepped
into
the
circle
where
madam
mina
slept
she
woke
from
her
sleep
and
seeing
me
cried
out
in
pain
that
i
had
endured
too
much
come
she
said
come
away
from
this
awful
place
let
us
go
to
meet
my
husband
who
is
i
know
coming
towards
us
she
was
looking
thin
and
pale
and
weak
but
her
eyes
were
pure
and
glowed
with
fervour
i
was
glad
to
see
her
paleness
and
her
illness
for
my
mind
was
full
of
the
fresh
horror
of
that
ruddy
vampire
sleep
and
so
with
trust
and
hope
and
yet
full
of
fear
we

journal
6
novemberit
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
professor
and
i
took
our
way
towards
the
east
whence
i
knew
jonathan
was
coming
we
did
not
go
fast
though
the
way
was
steeply
downhill
for
we
had
to
take
heavy
rugs
and
wraps
with
us
we
dared
not
face
the
possibility
of
being
left
without
warmth
in
the
cold
and
the
snow
we
had
to
take
some
of
our
provisions
too
for
we
were
in
a
perfect
desolation
and
so
far
as
we
could
see
through
the
snowfall
there
was
not
even
the
sign
of
habitation
when
we
had
gone
about
a
mile
i
was
tired
with
the
heavy
walking
and
sat
down
to
rest
then
we
looked
back
and
saw
where
the
clear
line
of
draculas
castle
cut
the
sky
for
we
were
so
deep
under
the
hill
whereon
it
was
set
that
the
angle
of
perspective
of
the
carpathian
mountains
was
far
below
it
we
saw
it
in
all
its
grandeur
perched
a
thousand
feet
on
the
summit
of
a
sheer
precipice
and
with
seemingly
a
great
gap
between
it
and
the
steep
of
the
adjacent
mountain
on
any
side
there
was
something
wild
and
uncanny
about
the
place
we
could
hear
the
distant
howling
of
wolves
they
were
far
off
but
the
sound
even
though
coming
muffled
through
the
deadening
snowfall
was
full
of
terror
i
knew
from
the
way
dr
van
helsing
was
searching
about
that
he
was
trying
to
seek
some
strategic
point
where
we
would
be
less
exposed
in
case
of
attack
the
rough
roadway
still
led
downwards
we
could
trace
it
through
the
drifted
snow
in
a
little
while
the
professor
signalled
to
me
so
i
got
up
and
joined
him
he
had
found
a
wonderful
spot
a
sort
of
natural
hollow
in
a
rock
with
an
entrance
like
a
doorway
between
two
boulders
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
drew
me
in
see
he
said
here
you
will
be
in
shelter
and
if
the
wolves
do
come
i
can
meet
them
one
by
one
he
brought
in
our
furs
and
made
a
snug
nest
for
me
and
got
out
some
provisions
and
forced
them
upon
me
but
i
could
not
eat
to
even
try
to
do
so
was
repulsive
to
me
and
much
as
i
would
have
liked
to
please
him
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
the
attempt
he
looked
very
sad
but
did
not
reproach
me
taking
his
fieldglasses
from
the
case
he
stood
on
the
top
of
the
rock
and
began
to
search
the
horizon
suddenly
he
called
out
look
madam
mina
look
look
i
sprang
up
and
stood
beside
him
on
the
rock
he
handed
me
his
glasses
and
pointed
the
snow
was
now
falling
more
heavily
and
swirled
about
fiercely
for
a
high
wind
was
beginning
to
blow
however
there
were
times
when
there
were
pauses
between
the
snow
flurries
and
i
could
see
a
long
way
round
from
the
height
where
we
were
it
was
possible
to
see
a
great
distance
and
far
off
beyond
the
white
waste
of
snow
i
could
see
the
river
lying
like
a
black
ribbon
in
kinks
and
curls
as
it
wound
its
way
straight
in
front
of
us
and
not
far
offin
fact
so
near
that
i
wondered
we
had
not
noticed
beforecame
a
group
of
mounted
men
hurrying
along
in
the
midst
of
them
was
a
cart
a
long
leiterwagon
which
swept
from
side
to
side
like
a
dogs
tail
wagging
with
each
stern
inequality
of
the
road
outlined
against
the
snow
as
they
were
i
could
see
from
the
mens
clothes
that
they
were
peasants
or
gypsies
of
some
kind
on
the
cart
was
a
great
square
chest
my
heart
leaped
as
i
saw
it
for
i
felt
that
the
end
was
coming
the
evening
was
now
drawing
close
and
well
i
knew
that
at
sunset
the
thing
which
was
till
then
imprisoned
there
would
take
new
freedom
and
could
in
any
of
many
forms
elude
all
pursuit
in
fear
i
turned
to
the
professor
to
my
consternation
however
he
was
not
there
an
instant
later
i
saw
him
below
me
round
the
rock
he
had
drawn
a
circle
such
as
we
had
found
shelter
in
last
night
when
he
had
completed
it
he
stood
beside
me
again
saying
at
least
you
shall
be
safe
here
from
him
he
took
the
glasses
from
me
and
at
the
next
lull
of
the
snow
swept
the
whole
space
below
us
see
he
said
they
come
quickly
they
are
flogging
the
horses
and
galloping
as
hard
as
they
can
he
paused
and
went
on
in
a
hollow
voice
they
are
racing
for
the
sunset
we
may
be
too
late
gods
will
be
done
down
came
another
blinding
rush
of
driving
snow
and
the
whole
landscape
was
blotted
out
it
soon
passed
however
and
once
more
his
glasses
were
fixed
on
the
plain
then
came
a
sudden
cry
look
look
look
see
two
horsemen
follow
fast
coming
up
from
the
south
it
must
be
quincey
and
john
take
the
glass
look
before
the
snow
blots
it
all
out
i
took
it
and
looked
the
two
men
might
be
dr
seward
and
mr
morris
i
knew
at
all
events
that
neither
of
them
was
jonathan
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
jonathan
was
not
far
off
looking
around
i
saw
on
the
north
side
of
the
coming
party
two
other
men
riding
at
breakneck
speed
one
of
them
i
knew
was
jonathan
and
the
other
i
took
of
course
to
be
lord
godalming
they
too
were
pursuing
the
party
with
the
cart
when
i
told
the
professor
he
shouted
in
glee
like
a
schoolboy
and
after
looking
intently
till
a
snow
fall
made
sight
impossible
he
laid
his
winchester
rifle
ready
for
use
against
the
boulder
at
the
opening
of
our
shelter
they
are
all
converging
he
said
when
the
time
comes
we
shall
have
gypsies
on
all
sides
i
got
out
my
revolver
ready
to
hand
for
whilst
we
were
speaking
the
howling
of
wolves
came
louder
and
closer
when
the
snow
storm
abated
a
moment
we
looked
again
it
was
strange
to
see
the
snow
falling
in
such
heavy
flakes
close
to
us
and
beyond
the
sun
shining
more
and
more
brightly
as
it
sank
down
towards
the
far
mountain
tops
sweeping
the
glass
all
around
us
i
could
see
here
and
there
dots
moving
singly
and
in
twos
and
threes
and
larger
numbersthe
wolves
were
gathering
for
their
prey
every
instant
seemed
an
age
whilst
we
waited
the
wind
came
now
in
fierce
bursts
and
the
snow
was
driven
with
fury
as
it
swept
upon
us
in
circling
eddies
at
times
we
could
not
see
an
arms
length
before
us
but
at
others
as
the
hollowsounding
wind
swept
by
us
it
seemed
to
clear
the
airspace
around
us
so
that
we
could
see
afar
off
we
had
of
late
been
so
accustomed
to
watch
for
sunrise
and
sunset
that
we
knew
with
fair
accuracy
when
it
would
be
and
we
knew
that
before
long
the
sun
would
set
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
by
our
watches
it
was
less
than
an
hour
that
we
waited
in
that
rocky
shelter
before
the
various
bodies
began
to
converge
close
upon
us
the
wind
came
now
with
fiercer
and
more
bitter
sweeps
and
more
steadily
from
the
north
it
seemingly
had
driven
the
snow
clouds
from
us
for
with
only
occasional
bursts
the
snow
fell
we
could
distinguish
clearly
the
individuals
of
each
party
the
pursued
and
the
pursuers
strangely
enough
those
pursued
did
not
seem
to
realise
or
at
least
to
care
that
they
were
pursued
they
seemed
however
to
hasten
with
redoubled
speed
as
the
sun
dropped
lower
and
lower
on
the
mountain
tops
closer
and
closer
they
drew
the
professor
and
i
crouched
down
behind
our
rock
and
held
our
weapons
ready
i
could
see
that
he
was
determined
that
they
should
not
pass
one
and
all
were
quite
unaware
of
our
presence
all
at
once
two
voices
shouted
out
to
halt
one
was
my
jonathans
raised
in
a
high
key
of
passion
the
other
mr
morris
strong
resolute
tone
of
quiet
command
the
gypsies
may
not
have
known
the
language
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
tone
in
whatever
tongue
the
words
were
spoken
instinctively
they
reined
in
and
at
the
instant
lord
godalming
and
jonathan
dashed
up
at
one
side
and
dr
seward
and
mr
morris
on
the
other
the
leader
of
the
gypsies
a
splendidlooking
fellow
who
sat
his
horse
like
a
centaur
waved
them
back
and
in
a
fierce
voice
gave
to
his
companions
some
word
to
proceed
they
lashed
the
horses
which
sprang
forward
but
the
four
men
raised
their
winchester
rifles
and
in
an
unmistakable
way
commanded
them
to
stop
at
the
same
moment
dr
van
helsing
and
i
rose
behind
the
rock
and
pointed
our
weapons
at
them
seeing
that
they
were
surrounded
the
men
tightened
their
reins
and
drew
up
the
leader
turned
to
them
and
gave
a
word
at
which
every
man
of
the
gypsy
party
drew
what
weapon
he
carried
knife
or
pistol
and
held
himself
in
readiness
to
attack
issue
was
joined
in
an
instant
the
leader
with
a
quick
movement
of
his
rein
threw
his
horse
out
in
front
and
pointing
first
to
the
sunnow
close
down
on
the
hill
topsand
then
to
the
castle
said
something
which
i
did
not
understand
for
answer
all
four
men
of
our
party
threw
themselves
from
their
horses
and
dashed
towards
the
cart
i
should
have
felt
terrible
fear
at
seeing
jonathan
in
such
danger
but
that
the
ardour
of
battle
must
have
been
upon
me
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
i
felt
no
fear
but
only
a
wild
surging
desire
to
do
something
seeing
the
quick
movement
of
our
parties
the
leader
of
the
gypsies
gave
a
command
his
men
instantly
formed
round
the
cart
in
a
sort
of
undisciplined
endeavour
each
one
shouldering
and
pushing
the
other
in
his
eagerness
to
carry
out
the
order
in
the
midst
of
this
i
could
see
that
jonathan
on
one
side
of
the
ring
of
men
and
quincey
on
the
other
were
forcing
a
way
to
the
cart
it
was
evident
that
they
were
bent
on
finishing
their
task
before
the
sun
should
set
nothing
seemed
to
stop
or
even
to
hinder
them
neither
the
levelled
weapons
nor
the
flashing
knives
of
the
gypsies
in
front
nor
the
howling
of
the
wolves
behind
appeared
to
even
attract
their
attention
jonathans
impetuosity
and
the
manifest
singleness
of
his
purpose
seemed
to
overawe
those
in
front
of
him
instinctively
they
cowered
aside
and
let
him
pass
in
an
instant
he
had
jumped
upon
the
cart
and
with
a
strength
which
seemed
incredible
raised
the
great
box
and
flung
it
over
the
wheel
to
the
ground
in
the
meantime
mr
morris
had
had
to
use
force
to
pass
through
his
side
of
the
ring
of
szgany
all
the
time
i
had
been
breathlessly
watching
jonathan
i
had
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
seen
him
pressing
desperately
forward
and
had
seen
the
knives
of
the
gypsies
flash
as
he
won
a
way
through
them
and
they
cut
at
him
he
had
parried
with
his
great
bowie
knife
and
at
first
i
thought
that
he
too
had
come
through
in
safety
but
as
he
sprang
beside
jonathan
who
had
by
now
jumped
from
the
cart
i
could
see
that
with
his
left
hand
he
was
clutching
at
his
side
and
that
the
blood
was
spurting
through
his
fingers
he
did
not
delay
notwithstanding
this
for
as
jonathan
with
desperate
energy
attacked
one
end
of
the
chest
attempting
to
prize
off
the
lid
with
his
great
kukri
knife
he
attacked
the
other
frantically
with
his
bowie
under
the
efforts
of
both
men
the
lid
began
to
yield
the
nails
drew
with
a
quick
screeching
sound
and
the
top
of
the
box
was
thrown
back
by
this
time
the
gypsies
seeing
themselves
covered
by
the
winchesters
and
at
the
mercy
of
lord
godalming
and
dr
seward
had
given
in
and
made
no
resistance
the
sun
was
almost
down
on
the
mountain
tops
and
the
shadows
of
the
whole
group
fell
long
upon
the
snow
i
saw
the
count
lying
within
the
box
upon
the
earth
some
of
which
the
rude
falling
from
the
cart
had
scattered
over
him
he
was
deathly
pale
just
like
a
waxen
image
and
the
red
eyes
glared
with
the
horrible
vindictive
look
which
i
knew
too
well
as
i
looked
the
eyes
saw
the
sinking
sun
and
the
look
of
hate
in
them
turned
to
triumph
but
on
the
instant
came
the
sweep
and
flash
of
jonathans
great
knife
i
shrieked
as
i
saw
it
shear
through
the
throat
whilst
at
the
same
moment
mr
morriss
bowie
knife
plunged
into
the
heart
it
was
like
a
miracle
but
before
our
very
eyes
and
almost
in
the
drawing
of
a
breath
the
whole
body
crumbled
into
dust
and
passed
from
our
sight
i
shall
be
glad
as
long
as
i
live
that
even
in
that
moment
of
final
dissolution
there
was
in
the
face
a
look
of
peace
such
as
i
never
could
have
imagined
might
have
rested
there
the
castle
of
dracula
now
stood
out
against
the
red
sky
and
every
stone
of
its
broken
battlements
was
articulated
against
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
the
gypsies
taking
us
as
in
some
way
the
cause
of
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
the
dead
man
turned
without
a
word
and
rode
away
as
if
for
their
lives
those
who
were
unmounted
jumped
upon
the
leiterwagon
and
shouted
to
the
horsemen
not
to
desert
them
the
wolves
which
had
withdrawn
to
a
safe
distance
followed
in
their
wake
leaving
us
alone
mr
morris
who
had
sunk
to
the
ground
leaned
on
his
elbow
holding
his
hand
pressed
to
his
side
the
blood
still
gushed
through
his
fingers
i
flew
to
him
for
the
holy
circle
did
not
now
keep
me
back
so
did
the
two
doctors
jonathan
knelt
behind
him
and
the
wounded
man
laid
back
his
head
on
his
shoulder
with
a
sigh
he
took
with
a
feeble
effort
my
hand
in
that
of
his
own
which
was
unstained
he
must
have
seen
the
anguish
of
my
heart
in
my
face
for
he
smiled
at
me
and
said
i
am
only
too
happy
to
have
been
of
any
service
oh
god
he
cried
suddenly
struggling
up
to
a
sitting
posture
and
pointing
to
me
it
was
worth
for
this
to
die
look
look
the
sun
was
now
right
down
upon
the
mountain
top
and
the
red
gleams
fell
upon
my
face
so
that
it
was
bathed
in
rosy
light
with
one
impulse
the
men
sank
on
their
knees
and
a
deep
and
earnest
amen
broke
from
all
as
their
eyes
followed
the
pointing
of
his
finger
the
dying
man
spoke
now
god
be
thanked
that
all
has
not
been
in
vain
see
the
snow
is
not
more
stainless
than
her
forehead
the
curse
has
passed
away
and
to
our
bitter
grief
with
a
smile
and
in
silence
he
died
a
gallant
gentleman
note
seven
years
ago
we
all
went
through
the
flames
and
the
happiness
of
some
of
us
since
then
is
we
think
well
worth
the
pain
we
endured
it
is
an
added
joy
to
mina
and
to
me
that
our
boys
birthday
is
the
same
day
as
that
on
which
quincey
morris
died
his
mother
holds
i
know
the
secret
belief
that
some
of
our
brave
friends
spirit
has
passed
into
him
his
bundle
of
names
links
all
our
little
band
of
men
together
but
we
call
him
quincey
in
the
summer
of
this
year
we
made
a
journey
to
transylvania
and
went
over
the
old
ground
which
was
and
is
to
us
so
full
of
vivid
and
terrible
memories
it
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
the
things
which
we
had
seen
with
our
own
eyes
and
heard
with
our
own
ears
were
living
truths
every
trace
of
all
that
had
been
was
blotted
out
the
castle
stood
as
before
reared
high
above
a
waste
of
desolation
when
we
got
home
we
were
talking
of
the
old
timewhich
we
could
all
look
back
on
without
despair
for
godalming
and
seward
are
both
happily
married
i
took
the
papers
from
the
safe
where
they
had
been
ever
since
our
return
so
long
ago
we
were
struck
with
the
fact
that
in
all
the
mass
of
material
of
which
the
record
is
composed
there
is
hardly
one
authentic
document
nothing
but
a
mass
of
typewriting
except
the
later
notebooks
of
mina
and
seward
and
myself
and
van
helsings
memorandum
we
could
hardly
ask
any
one
even
did
we
wish
to
to
accept
these
as
proofs
of
so
wild
a
story
van
helsing
summed
it
all
up
as
he
said
with
our
boy
on
his
knee
we
want
no
proofs
we
ask
none
to
believe
us
this
boy
will
some
day
know
what
a
brave
and
gallant
woman
his
mother
is
already
he
knows
her
sweetness
and
loving
care
later
on
he
will
understand
how
some
men
so
loved
her
that
they
did
dare
much
for
her
sake

midjanuary
1907
a
strange
story
comes
from
the
adriatic
it
appears
that
on
the
night
of
the
9th
as
the
italia
steamship
companys
vessel
victorine
was
passing
a
little
before
midnight
the
point
known
as
the
spear
of
ivan
on
the
coast
of
the
blue
mountains
the
attention
of
the
captain
then
on
the
bridge
was
called
by
the
lookout
man
to
a
tiny
floating
light
close
inshore
it
is
the
custom
of
some
southgoing
ships
to
run
close
to
the
spear
of
ivan
in
fine
weather
as
the
water
is
deep
and
there
is
no
settled
current
also
there
are
no
outlying
rocks
indeed
some
years
ago
the
local
steamers
had
become
accustomed
to
hug
the
shore
here
so
closely
that
an
intimation
was
sent
from
lloyds
that
any
mischance
under
the
circumstances
would
not
be
included
in
ordinary
sea
risks
captain
mirolani
is
one
of
those
who
insist
on
a
wholesome
distance
from
the
promontory
being
kept
but
on
his
attention
having
been
called
to
the
circumstance
reported
he
thought
it
well
to
investigate
it
as
it
might
be
some
case
of
personal
distress
accordingly
he
had
the
engines
slowed
down
and
edged
cautiously
in
towards
shore
he
was
joined
on
the
bridge
by
two
of
his
officers
signori
falamano
and
destilia
and
by
one
passenger
on
board
mr
peter
caulfield
whose
reports
of
spiritual
phenomena
in
remote
places
are
well
known
to
the
readers
of
the
journal
of
occultism
the
following
account
of
the
strange
occurrence
written
by
him
and
attested
by
the
signatures
of
captain
mirolani
and
the
other
gentleman
named
has
been
sent
to
us




it
was
eleven
minutes
before
twelve
midnight
on
saturday
the
9th
day
of
january
1907
when
i
saw
the
strange
sight
off
the
headland
known
as
the
spear
of
ivan
on
the
coast
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
it
was
a
fine
night
and
i
stood
right
on
the
bows
of
the
ship
where
there
was
nothing
to
obstruct
my
view
we
were
some
distance
from
the
spear
of
ivan
passing
from
northern
to
southern
point
of
the
wide
bay
into
which
it
projects
captain
mirolani
the
master
is
a
very
careful
seaman
and
gives
on
his
journeys
a
wide
berth
to
the
bay
which
is
tabooed
by
lloyds
but
when
he
saw
in
the
moonlight
though
far
off
a
tiny
white
figure
of
a
woman
drifting
on
some
strange
current
in
a
small
boat
on
the
prow
of
which
rested
a
faint
light
to
me
it
looked
like
a
corpsecandle
he
thought
it
might
be
some
person
in
distress
and
began
to
cautiously
edge
towards
it
two
of
his
officers
were
with
him
on
the
bridgesignori
falamano
and
destilia
all
these
three
as
well
as
myself
saw
it
the
rest
of
the
crew
and
passengers
were
below
as
we
got
close
the
true
inwardness
of
it
became
apparent
to
me
but
the
mariners
did
not
seem
to
realize
till
the
very
last
this
is
after
all
not
strange
for
none
of
them
had
either
knowledge
or
experience
in
occult
matters
whereas
for
over
thirty
years
i
have
made
a
special
study
of
this
subject
and
have
gone
to
and
fro
over
the
earth
investigating
to
the
nth
all
records
of
spiritual
phenomena
as
i
could
see
from
their
movements
that
the
officers
did
not
comprehend
that
which
was
so
apparent
to
myself
i
took
care
not
to
enlighten
them
lest
such
should
result
in
the
changing
of
the
vessels
course
before
i
should
be
near
enough
to
make
accurate
observation
all
turned
out
as
i
wishedat
least
nearly
soas
shall
be
seen
being
in
the
bow
i
had
of
course
a
better
view
than
from
the
bridge
presently
i
made
out
that
the
boat
which
had
all
along
seemed
to
be
of
a
queer
shape
was
none
other
than
a
coffin
and
that
the
woman
standing
up
in
it
was
clothed
in
a
shroud
her
back
was
towards
us
and
she
had
evidently
not
heard
our
approach
as
we
were
creeping
along
slowly
the
engines
were
almost
noiseless
and
there
was
hardly
a
ripple
as
our
forefoot
cut
the
dark
water
suddenly
there
was
a
wild
cry
from
the
bridgeitalians
are
certainly
very
excitable
hoarse
commands
were
given
to
the
quartermaster
at
the
wheel
the
engineroom
bell
clanged
on
the
instant

before

the

fading
in

the
last
thing
i
saw
was
the
flash
of
a
white
face
with
dark
burning
eyes

the

sank
down

record
of
all
pertaining
to

of
my
late
granduncle
roger
melton
to
which
end
let
me
put
down
the
various
members
of
his
family
and
explain
some
of
their
occupations
and
idiosyncrasies
my
father
ernest
halbard
melton
was
the
only
son
of
ernest
melton
eldest
son
of
sir
geoffrey
halbard
melton
of
humcroft
in
the
shire
of
salop
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
at
one
time
sheriff
my
greatgrandfather
sir
geoffrey
had
inherited
a
small
estate
from
his
father
roger
melton
in
his
time
by
the
way
the
name
was
spelled
milton
but
my
greatgreatgrandfather
changed
the
spelling
to
the
later
form
as
he
was
a
practical
man
not
given
to
sentiment
and
feared
lest
he
should
in
the
public
eye
be
confused
with
others
belonging
to
the
family
of
a
radical
person
called
milton
who
wrote
poetry
and
was
some
sort
of
official
in
the
time
of
cromwell
whilst
we
are
conservatives
the
same
practical
spirit
which
originated
the
change
in
the
spelling
of
the
family
name
inclined
him
to
go
into
business
so
he
became
whilst
still
young
a
tanner
and
leatherdresser
he
utilized
for
the
purpose
the
ponds
and
streams
and
also
the
oakwoods
on
his
estatetorraby
in
suffolk
he
made
a
fine
business
and
accumulated
a
considerable
fortune
with
a
part
of
which
he
purchased
the
shropshire
estate
which
he
entailed
and
to
which
i
am
therefore
heirapparent
sir
geoffrey
had
in
addition
to
my
grandfather
three
sons
and
a
daughter
the
latter
being
born
twenty
years
after
her
youngest
brother
these
sons
were
geoffrey
who
died
without
issue
having
been
killed
in
the
indian
mutiny
at
meerut
in
1857
at
which
he
took
up
a
sword
though
a
civilian
to
fight
for
his
life
roger
to
whom
i
shall
refer
presently
and
johnthe
latter
like
geoffrey
dying
unmarried
out
of
sir
geoffreys
family
of
five
therefore
only
three
have
to
be
considered
my
grandfather
who
had
three
children
two
of
whom
a
son
and
a
daughter
died
young
leaving
only
my
father
roger
and
patience
patience
who
was
born
in
1858
married
an
irishman
of
the
name
of
sellengerwhich
was
the
usual
way
of
pronouncing
the
name
of
st
leger
or
as
they
spelled
it
sent
legerrestored
by
later
generations
to
the
still
older
form
he
was
a
reckless
daredevil
sort
of
fellow
then
a
captain
in
the
lancers
a
man
not
without
the
quality
of
braveryhe
won
the
victoria
cross
at
the
battle
of
amoaful
in
the
ashantee
campaign
but
i
fear
he
lacked
the
seriousness
and
steadfast
strenuous
purpose
which
my
father
always
says
marks
the
character
of
our
own
family
he
ran
through
nearly
all
of
his
patrimonynever
a
very
large
one
and
had
it
not
been
for
my
grandaunts
little
fortune
his
days
had
he
lived
must
have
ended
in
comparative
poverty
comparative
not
actual
for
the
meltons
who
are
persons
of
considerable
pride
would
not
have
tolerated
a
povertystricken
branch
of
the
family
we
dont
think
much
of
that
lotany
of
us
fortunately
my
greataunt
patience
had
only
one
child
and
the
premature
decease
of
captain
st
leger
as
i
prefer
to
call
the
name
did
not
allow
of
the
possibility
of
her
having
more
she
did
not
marry
again
though
my
grandmother
tried
several
times
to
arrange
an
alliance
for
her
she
was
i
am
told
always
a
stiff
uppish
person
who
would
not
yield
herself
to
the
wisdom
of
her
superiors
her
own
child
was
a
son
who
seemed
to
take
his
character
rather
from
his
fathers
family
than
from
my
own
he
was
a
wastrel
and
a
rolling
stone
always
in
scrapes
at
school
and
always
wanting
to
do
ridiculous
things
my
father
as
head
of
the
house
and
his
own
senior
by
eighteen
years
tried
often
to
admonish
him
but
his
perversity
of
spirit
and
his
truculence
were
such
that
he
had
to
desist
indeed
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
he
sometimes
threatened
his
life
a
desperate
character
he
was
and
almost
devoid
of
reverence
no
one
not
even
my
father
had
any
influencegood
influence
of
course
i
meanover
him
except
his
mother
who
was
of
my
family
and
also
a
woman
who
lived
with
hera
sort
of
governessaunt
he
called
her
the
way
of
it
was
this
captain
st
leger
had
a
younger
brother
who
made
an
improvident
marriage
with
a
scotch
girl
when
they
were
both
very
young
they
had
nothing
to
live
on
except
what
the
reckless
lancer
gave
them
for
he
had
next
to
nothing
himself
and
she
was
barewhich
is
i
understand
the
indelicate
scottish
way
of
expressing
lack
of
fortune
she
was
however
i
understand
of
an
old
and
somewhat
good
family
though
broken
in
fortuneto
use
an
expression
which
however
could
hardly
be
used
precisely
in
regard
to
a
family
or
a
person
who
never
had
fortune
to
be
broken
in
it
was
so
far
well
that
the
mackelpiesthat
was
the
maiden
name
of
mrs
st
legerwere
reputableso
far
as
fighting
was
concerned
it
would
have
been
too
humiliating
to
have
allied
to
our
family
even
on
the
distaff
side
a
family
both
poor
and
of
no
account
fighting
alone
does
not
make
a
family
i
think
soldiers
are
not
everything
though
they
think
they
are
we
have
had
in
our
family
men
who
fought
but
i
never
heard
of
any
of
them
who
fought
because
they
wanted
to
mrs
st
leger
had
a
sister
fortunately
there
were
only
those
two
children
in
the
family
or
else
they
would
all
have
had
to
be
supported
by
the
money
of
my
family
mr
st
leger
who
was
only
a
subaltern
was
killed
at
maiwand
and
his
wife
was
left
a
beggar
fortunately
however
she
diedher
sister
spread
a
story
that
it
was
from
the
shock
and
griefbefore
the
child
which
she
expected
was
born
this
all
happened
when
my
cousinor
rather
my
fathers
cousin
my
firstcousinonceremoved
to
be
accuratewas
still
a
very
small
child
his
mother
then
sent
for
miss
mackelpie
her
brotherinlaws
sisterinlaw
to
come
and
live
with
her
which
she
didbeggars
cant
be
choosers
and
she
helped
to
bring
up
young
st
leger
i
remember
once
my
father
giving
me
a
sovereign
for
making
a
witty
remark
about
her
i
was
quite
a
boy
then
not
more
than
thirteen
but
our
family
were
always
clever
from
the
very
beginning
of
life
and
father
was
telling
me
about
the
st
leger
family
my
family
hadnt
of
course
seen
anything
of
them
since
captain
st
leger
diedthe
circle
to
which
we
belong
dont
care
for
poor
relationsand
was
explaining
where
miss
mackelpie
came
in
she
must
have
been
a
sort
of
nursery
governess
for
mrs
st
leger
once
told
him
that
she
helped
her
to
educate
the
child
then
father
i
said
if
she
helped
to
educate
the
child
she
ought
to
have
been
called
miss
macskelpie
when
my
firstcousinonceremoved
rupert
was
twelve
years
old
his
mother
died
and
he
was
in
the
dolefuls
about
it
for
more
than
a
year
miss
mackelpie
kept
on
living
with
him
all
the
same
catch
her
quitting
that
sort
dont
go
into
the
poorhouse
when
they
can
keep
out
my
father
being
head
of
the
family
was
of
course
one
of
the
trustees
and
his
uncle
roger
brother
of
the
testator
another
the
third
was
general
mackelpie
a
povertystricken
scotch
laird
who
had
a
lot
of
valueless
land
at
croom
in
rossshire
i
remember
father
gave
me
a
new
tenpound
note
when
i
interrupted
him
whilst
he
was
telling
me
of
the
incident
of
young
st
legers
improvidence
by
remarking
that
he
was
in
error
as
to
the
land
from
what
i
had
heard
of
mackelpies
estate
it
was
productive
of
one
thing
when
he
asked
me
what
i
answered
mortgages
father
i
knew
had
bought
not
long
before
a
lot
of
them
at
what
a
college
friend
of
mine
from
chicago
used
to
call
cutthroat
price
when
i
remonstrated
with
my
father
for
buying
them
at
all
and
so
injuring
the
family
estate
which
i
was
to
inherit
he
gave
me
an
answer
the
astuteness
of
which
i
have
never
forgotten
i
did
it
so
that
i
might
keep
my
hand
on
the
bold
general
in
case
he
should
ever
prove
troublesome
and
if
the
worst
should
ever
come
to
the
worst
croom
is
a
good
country
for
grouse
and
stags
my
father
can
see
as
far
as
most
men
when
my
cousini
shall
call
him
cousin
henceforth
in
this
record
lest
it
might
seem
to
any
unkind
person
who
might
hereafter
read
it
that
i
wished
to
taunt
rupert
st
leger
with
his
somewhat
obscure
position
in
reiterating
his
real
distance
in
kinship
with
my
familywhen
my
cousin
rupert
st
leger
wished
to
commit
a
certain
idiotic
act
of
financial
folly
he
approached
my
father
on
the
subject
arriving
at
our
estate
humcroft
at
an
inconvenient
time
without
permission
not
having
had
even
the
decent
courtesy
to
say
he
was
coming
i
was
then
a
little
chap
of
six
years
old
but
i
could
not
help
noticing
his
mean
appearance
he
was
all
dusty
and
dishevelled
when
my
father
saw
himi
came
into
the
study
with
himhe
said
in
a
horrified
voice
good
god
he
was
further
shocked
when
the
boy
brusquely
acknowledged
in
reply
to
my
fathers
greeting
that
he
had
travelled
third
class
of
course
none
of
my
family
ever
go
anything
but
first
class
even
the
servants
go
second
my
father
was
really
angry
when
he
said
he
had
walked
up
from
the
station
a
nice
spectacle
for
my
tenants
and
my
tradesmen
to
see
mymya
kinsman
of
my
house
howsoever
remote
trudging
like
a
tramp
on
the
road
to
my
estate
why
my
avenue
is
two
miles
and
a
perch
no
wonder
you
are
filthy
and
insolent
rupertreally
i
cannot
call

exceedingly
impertinent
to
my
father
i
walked

because
i
had
no
money
but
i
assure
you
i
did
not
mean
to
be
insolent
i
simply
came
here
because
i
wished
to
ask
your
advice
and
assistance
not
because
you
are
an
important
person
and
have
a
long
avenueas

my
costbut

your
pardon

said
quite
quietly

i
am
under
age
cannot
do
myself
it
must
be
done
through
the
trustees
of
my
mothers
will
and
the
assistance
for
which
you
wish
said
father
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
i
know
what
that
action
means
when
i
am
talking
to
him
the
assistance
i
want
said
rupert
getting
redder
than
ever
is
from
mythe
trustee
also
to
carry
out
what
i
want
to
do
and
what
may
that
be
asked
my
father
i
would
like
sir
to
make
over
to
my
aunt
janet
my
father
interrupted
him
by
askinghe
had
evidently
remembered
my
jest
miss
macskelpie
rupert
got
still
redder
and
i
turned
away
i
didnt
quite
wish
that
he
should
see
me
laughing
he
went
on
quietly
mackelpie
sir
miss
janet
mackelpie
my
aunt
who
has
always
been
so
kind
to
me
and
whom
my
mother
lovedi
want
to
have
made
over
to
her
the
money
which
my
dear
mother
left
to
me
father
doubtless
wished
to
have
the
matter
take
a
less
serious
turn
for
ruperts
eyes
were
all
shiny
with
tears
which
had
not
fallen
so
after
a
little
pause
he
said
with
indignation
which
i
knew
was
simulated
have
you
forgotten
your
mother
so
soon
rupert
that
you
wish
to
give
away
the
very
last
gift
which
she
bestowed
on
you
rupert
was
sitting
but
he
jumped
up
and
stood
opposite
my
father
with
his
fist
clenched
he
was
quite
pale
now
and
his
eyes
looked
so
fierce
that
i
thought
he
would
do
my
father
an
injury
he
spoke
in
a
voice
which
did
not
seem
like
his
own
it
was
so
strong
and
deep
sir
he
roared
out
i
suppose
if
i
was
a
writer
which
thank
god
i
am
noti
have
no
need
to
follow
a
menial
occupationi
would
call
it
thundered
thundered
is
a
longer
word
than
roared
and
would
of
course
help
to
gain
the
penny
which
a
writer
gets
for
a
line
father
got
pale
too
and
stood
quite
still
rupert
looked
at
him
steadily
for
quite
half
a
minuteit
seemed
longer
at
the
timeand
suddenly
smiled
and
said
as
he
sat
down
again
sorry
but
of
course
you
dont
understand
such
things
then
he
went
on
talking
before
father
had
time
to
say
a
word
let
us
get
back
to
business
as
you
do
not
seem
to
follow
me
let
me
explain
that
it
is
because
i
do
not
forget
that
i
wish
to
do
this
i
remember
my
dear
mothers
wish
to
make
aunt
janet
happy
and
would
like
to
do
as
she
did
aunt
janet
said
father
very
properly
sneering
at
his
ignorance
she
is
not
your
aunt
why
even
her
sister
who
was
married
to
your
uncle
was
only
your
aunt
by
courtesy
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
rupert
meant
to
be
rude
to
my
father
though
his
words
were
quite
polite
if
i
had
been
as
much
bigger
than
him
as
he
was
than
me
i
should
have
flown
at
him
but
he
was
a
very
big
boy
for
his
age
i
am
myself
rather
thin
mother
says
thinness
is
an
appanage
of
birth
my
aunt
janet
sir
is
an
aunt
by
love
courtesy
is
a
small
word
to
use
in
connection
with
such
devotion
as
she
has
given
to
us
but
i
neednt
trouble
you
with
such
things
sir
i
take
it
that
my
relations
on
the
side
of
my
own
house
do
not
affect
you
i
am
a
sent
leger
father
looked
quite
taken
aback
he
sat
quite
still
before
he
spoke
well
mr
st
leger
i
shall
think
over
the
matter
for
a
while
and
shall
presently
let
you
know
my
decision
in
the
meantime
would
you
like
something
to
eat
i
take
it
that
as
you
must
have
started
very
early
you
have
not
had
any
breakfast
rupert
smiled
quite
genially
that
is
true
sir
i
havent
broken
bread
since
dinner
last
night
and
i
am
ravenously
hungry
father
rang
the
bell
and
told
the
footman
who
answered
it
to
send
the
housekeeper
when
she
came
father
said
to
her
mrs
martindale
take
this
boy
to
your
room
and
give
him
some
breakfast
rupert
stood
very
still
for
some
seconds
his
face
had
got
red
again
after
his
paleness
then
he
bowed
to
my
father
and
followed
mrs
martindale
who
had
moved
to
the
door
nearly
an
hour
afterwards
my
father
sent
a
servant
to
tell
him
to
come
to
the
study
my
mother
was
there
too
and
i
had
gone
back
with
her
the
man
came
back
and
said
mrs
martindale
sir
wishes
to
know
with
her
respectful
service
if
she
may
have
a
word
with
you
before
father
could
reply
mother
told
him
to
bring
her
the
housekeeper
could
not
have
been
far
offthat
kind
are
generally
near
a
keyholefor
she
came
at
once
when
she
came
in
she
stood
at
the
door
curtseying
and
looking
pale
father
said
well
i
thought
sir
and
maam
that
i
had
better
come
and
tell
you
about
master
sent
leger
i
would
have
come
at
once
but
i
feared
to
disturb
you
well
father
had
a
stern
way
with
servants
when
im
head
of
the
family
ill
tread
them
under
my
feet
thats
the
way
to
get
real
devotion
from
servants
if
you
please
sir
i
took
the
young
gentleman
into
my
room
and
ordered
a
nice
breakfast
for
him
for
i
could
see
he
was
half
famisheda
growing
boy
like
him
and
so
tall
presently
it
came
along
it
was
a
good
breakfast
too
the
very
smell
of
it
made
even
me
hungry
there
were
eggs
and
frizzled
ham
and
grilled
kidneys
and
coffee
and
buttered
toast
and
bloaterpaste
that
will
do
as
to
the
menu
said
mother
go
on
when
it
was
all
ready
and
the
maid
had
gone
i
put
a
chair
to
the
table
and
said
now
sir

breakfast
is
ready
he
stood
up
and
said
thank
you
madam
you
are
very
kind
and
he
bowed
to
me
quite
nicely
just
as
if
i
was
a
lady
maam
go
on
said
mother
then
sir
he
held
out
his
hand
and
said
goodbye
and
thank
you
and
he
took
up
his
cap
but
arent
you
going
to
have
any
breakfast
sir
i
says

he
said
i
couldnt
eat
here



in
this
house
i
mean
well
maam
he
looked
so
lonely
that
i
felt
my
heart
melting
and
i
ventured
to
ask
him
if
there
was
any
mortal
thing
i
could
do
for
him
do
tell
me
dear
i
ventured
to
say
i
am
an
old
woman
and
you
sir
are
only
a
boy
though
its
a
fine
man
you
will
belike
your
dear
splendid
father
which
i
remember
so
well
and
gentle
like
your
poor
dear
mother
youre
a
dear
he
says
and
with
that
i
took
up
his
hand
and
kissed
it
for
i
remember
his
poor
dear
mother
so
well
that
was
dead
only
a
year
well
with
that
he
turned
his
head
away
and
when
i
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
him
roundhe
is
only
a
young
boy
maam
for
all
he
is
so
bigi
saw
that
the
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
with
that
i
laid
his
head
on
my
breastive
had
children
of
my
own
maam
as
you
know
though
theyre
all
gone
he
came
willing
enough
and
sobbed
for
a
little
bit
then
he
straightened
himself
up
and
i
stood
respectfully
beside
him
tell
mr
melton
he
said
that
i
shall
not
trouble
him
about
the
trustee
business
but
wont
you
tell
him
yourself
sir
when
you
see
him
i
says
i
shall
not
see
him
again
he
says
i
am
going
back
now
well
maam
i
knew
hed
had
no
breakfast
though
he
was
hungry
and
that
he
would
walk
as
he
come
so
i
ventured
to
say
if
you
wont
take
it
a
liberty
sir
may
i
do
anything
to
make
your
going
easier

you
sufficient
money
sir
if
not
may
i
give
or
lend
you
some
i
shall
be
very
proud
if
you
will
allow
me
to
yes
he
says
quite
hearty
if
you
will
you
might
lend
me
a
shilling
as
i
have
no
money
i
shall
not
forget
it
he
said
as
he
took
the
coin
i
shall
return
the
amount
though
i
never
can
the
kindness
i
shall
keep
the
coin
he
took
the
shilling
sirhe
wouldnt
take
any
moreand
then
he
said
goodbye
at
the
door
he
turned
and
walked
back
to
me
and
put
his
arms
round
me
like
a
real
boy
does
and
gave
me
a
hug
and
says
he
thank
you
a
thousand
times
mrs
martindale
for
your
goodness
to
me
for
your
sympathy
and
for
the
way
you
have
spoken
of
my
father
and
mother
you
have
seen
me
cry
mrs
martindale
he
said
i
dont
often
cry
the
last
time
was
when
i
came
back
to
the
lonely
house
after
my
poor
dear
was
laid
to
rest
but
you
nor
any
other
shall
ever
see
a
tear
of
mine
again
and
with
that
he
straightened
out
his
big
back
and
held
up
his
fine
proud
head
and
walked
out
i
saw
him
from
the
window
striding
down
the
avenue
my
but
he
is
a
proud
boy
siran
honour
to
your
family
sir
say
i
respectfully
and
there
the
proud
child
has
gone
away
hungry
and
he
wont
i
know
ever
use
that
shilling
to
buy
food
father
was
not
going
to
have
that
you
know
so
he
said
to
her
he
does
not
belong
to
my
family
i
would
have
you
to
know
true
he
is
allied
to
us
through
the
female
side
but
we
do
not
count
him
or
his
in
my
family
he
turned
away
and
began
to
read
a
book
it
was
a
decided
snub
to
her
but
mother
had
a
word
to
say
before
mrs
martindale
was
done
with
mother
has
a
pride
of
her
own
and
doesnt
brook
insolence
from
inferiors
and
the
housekeepers
conduct
seemed
to
be
rather
presuming
mother
of
course
isnt
quite
our
class
though
her
folk
are
quite
worthy
and
enormously
rich
she
is
one
of
the
dalmallingtons
the
salt
people
one
of
whom
got
a
peerage
when
the
conservatives
went
out
she
said
to
the
housekeeper
i
think
mrs
martindale
that
i
shall
not
require
your
services
after
this
day
month
and
as
i
dont
keep
servants

the
25th
of
this
month
and
another
month
in
lieu
of
notice
sign
this
receipt
she
was
writing
a
receipt
as
she
spoke
the
other
signed
it
without
a
word
and
handed
it
to
her
she
seemed
quite
flabbergasted

up

is
the
way
that

i
should

me
say
here
that
the
dismissed

was
engaged
the
very
next
day
by
the
countess
of
salop
i
may
say
in
explanation
that
the
earl
of
salop
kg
who
is
lordlieutenant
of
the
county
is
jealous
of
fathers

is
going
to
contest
the
next
election

my

i
am
truly
sorry
i
am
unable
to
agree
with
your
request
that
i
should
acquiesce
in
your
desire
to
transfer
to

by

of

i
am

let
me
say
at
once
that
had
it
been
possible
to
me
to
do
so
i
should
have
held
it
a
privilege
to
further
such
a
wishnot
because
the
beneficiare
whom
you
would
create
is
a
near
kinswoman
of
my
own
that
in

is
my
real
difficulty
i
have
undertaken
a
trust
made
by
an
honourable
lady
on
behalf
of
her
only
sonson
of
a
man
of
stainless
honour
and
a
dear
friend
of
my
own
and
whose
son
has
a
rich
heritage
of
honour
from
both
parents
and
who
will
i
am
sure
like
to
look
back
on
his
whole
life
as
worthy
of
his
parents
and
of
those
whom
his
parents
trusted
you
will
see
i
am
sure
that
whatsoever
i
might
grant
regarding
anyone
else
my
hands
are
tied
in
this
matter
and
now
let
me
say
my
dear
boy
that
your
letter
has
given
me
the
most
intense
pleasure
it
is
an
unspeakable
delight
to
me
to
find
in
the
son
of
your
fathera
man
whom
i
loved
and
a
boy
whom
i
lovethe
same
generosity
of
spirit
which
endeared
your
father
to
all
his
comrades
old
as
well
as
young
come
what
may
i
shall
always
be
proud
of
you
and
if
the
sword
of
an
old
soldierit
is
all
i
havecan
ever
serve
you
in
any
way
it
and
its
masters
life
are
and
shall
be
whilst
life
remains
to
him
yours
it
grieves
me
to
think
that
janet
cannot
through
my
act
be
given
that
ease
and
tranquillity
of
spirit
which
come
from
competence
but
my
dear
rupert
you
will
be
of
full
age
in
seven
years
more
then
if
you
are
in
the
same
mindand
i
am
sure
you
will
not
changeyou
being
your
own
master
can
do
freely
as
you
will
in
the
meantime
to
secure
so
far
as
i
can
my
dear
janet
against
any
malign
stroke
of
fortune
i
have
given
orders
to
my
factor
to
remit
semiannually
to
janet
one
full
half
of
such
income
as
may
be
derived
in
any
form
from
my
estate
of
croom
it
is
i
am
sorry
to
say
heavily
mortgaged
but
of
such
as
isor
may
be
free
from
such
charge
as
the
mortgage
entailssomething
at
least
will
i
trust
remain
to
her
and
my
dear
boy
i
can
frankly
say
that
it
is
to
me
a
real
pleasure
that
you
and
i
can
be
linked
in
one
more
bond
in
this
association
of
purpose
i
have
always
held
you
in
my
heart
as
though
you
were
my
own
son
let
me
tell
you
now
that
you
have
acted
as
i
should
have
liked
a
son

1892
my
dear
nephew
your
letter
of
the
30th
ult
received
have
carefully
considered
matter
stated
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
my
duty
as
a
trustee
would
not
allow
me
to
give
full
consent
as
you
wish
let
me
explain
the
testator
in
making
her
will
intended
that
such
fortune
as
she
had
at
disposal
should
be
used
to
supply
to
you
her
son
such
benefits
as
its
annual
product
should
procure
to
this
end
and
to
provide
against
wastefulness
or
foolishness
on
your
part
or
indeed
against
any
generosity
howsoever
worthy
which
might
impoverish
you
and
so
defeat
her
benevolent
intentions
regarding
your
education
comfort
and
future
good
she
did
not
place
the
estate
directly
in
your
hands
leaving
you
to
do
as
you
might
feel
inclined
about
it
but
on
the
contrary
she
entrusted
the
corpus
of
it
in
the
hands
of
men
whom
she
believed
should
be
resolute
enough
and
strong
enough
to
carry
out
her
intent
even
against
any
cajolements
or
pressure
which
might
be
employed
to
the
contrary
it
being
her
intention
then
that
such
trustees
as
she
appointed
would
use
for
your
benefit
the
interest
accruing
annually
from
the
capital
at
command
and
that
only
as
specifically
directed
in
the
will
so
that
on
your
arriving
at
full
age
the
capital
entrusted
to
us
should
be
handed
over
to
you
intact
i
find
a
hardandfast
duty
in
the
matter
of
adhering
exactly
to
the
directions
given
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
cotrustees
regard
the
matter
in
exactly
the
same
light
under
the
circumstances
therefore
we
the
trustees
have
not
only
a
single
and
united
duty
towards
you
as
the
object
of
the
testators
wishes
but
towards
each
other
as
regards
the
manner
of
the
carrying
out
of
that
duty
i
take
it
therefore
that
it
would
not
be
consonant
with
the
spirit
of
the
trust
or
of
our
own
ideas
in
accepting
it
that
any
of
us
should
take
a
course
pleasant
to
himself
which
would
or
might
involve
a
stern
opposition
on
the
part
of
other
of
the
cotrustees
we
have
each
of
us
to
do
the
unpleasant
part
of
this
duty
without
fear
or
favour
you
understand
of
course
that
the
time
which
must
elapse
before
you
come
into
absolute
possession
of
your
estate
is
a
limited
one
as
by
the
terms
of
the
will
we
are
to
hand
over
our
trust
when
you
have
reached
the
age
of
twentyone
there
are
only
seven
years
to
expire
but
till
then
though
i
should
gladly
meet
your
wishes
if
i
could
i
must
adhere
to
the
duty
which
i
have
undertaken
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
you
will
be
quite
free
to
divest
yourself
of
your
estate
without
protest
or
comment
of
any
man
having
now
expressed
as
clearly
as
i
can
the
limitations
by
which
i
am
bound
with
regard
to
the
corpus
of
your
estate
let
me
say
that
in
any
other
way
which
is
in
my
power
or
discretion
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
see
your
wishes
carried
out
so
far
as
rests
with
me
indeed
i
shall
undertake
to
use
what
influence
i
may
possess
with
my
cotrustees
to
induce
them
to
take
a
similar
view
of
your
wishes
in
my
own
thinking
you
are
quite
free
to
use
your
own
property
in
your
own
way
but
as
until
you
shall
have
attained
your
majority
you
have
only
lifeuser
in
your
mothers
bequest
you
are
only
at
liberty
to
deal
with
the
annual
increment
on
our
part
as
trustees
we
have
a
first
charge
on
that
increment
to
be
used
for
purposes
of
your
maintenance
clothes
and
education
as
to
what
may
remain
over
each
halfyear
you
will
be
free
to
deal
with
it
as
you
choose
on
receiving
from
you
a
written
authorization
to
your
trustees
if
you
desire
the
whole
sum
or
any
part
of
it
to
be
paid
over
to
miss
janet
mackelpie
i
shall
see
that
it
is
effected
believe
me
that
our
duty
is
to
protect
the
corpus
of
the
estate
and
to
this
end
we
may
not
act
on
any
instruction
to
imperil
it
but
there
our
warranty
stops
we
can
deal
during
our
trusteeship
with
the
corpus
only
further
lest
there
should
arise
any
error
on
your
part
we
can
deal
with
any
general
instruction
for
only
so
long
as
it
may
remain
unrevoked
you
are
and
must
be
free
to
alter
your
instructions
or
authorizations
at
any
time
thus
your
latest
document
must
be
used
for
our
guidance
as
to
the
general
principle
involved
in
your
wish
i
make
no
comment
you
are
at
liberty
to
deal
with
your
own
how
you
will
i
quite
understand
that
your
impulse
is
a
generous
one
and
i
fully
believe
that
it
is
in
consonance
with
what
had
always
been
the
wishes
of
my
sister
had
she
been
happily
alive
and
had
to
give
judgment
of
your
intent
i
am
convinced
that
she
would
have
approved
therefore
my
dear
nephew
should
you
so
wish
i
shall
be
happy
for
her
sake
as
well
as
your
own
to
pay
over
on
your
account
as
a
confidential
matter
between
you
and
me
but
from
my
own
pocket
a
sum
equal
to
that
which
you
wish
transferred
to
miss
janet

on
hearing
from
you
i
shall
know
how
to

in
the
matter

my
dear
uncle
thank
you
heartily
for
your
kind
letter
i
quite
understand
and
now
see
that
i
should
not
have
asked
you
as
a
trustee
such
a
thing
i
see
your
duty
clearly
and
agree
with
your
view
of
it
i
enclose
a
letter
directed
to
my
trustees
asking
them
to
pay
over
annually
till

at
this

whatever
sum
may
remain
over
from
the
interest
of
my

deduction
of
such
expenses
as
you
may
deem
fit
for
my
maintenance
clothing
and
education
together
with
a
sum
of
one
pound
sterling

month
which
was
the
amount
my
dear
mother
always
gave
me

my
personal

she
called
it
with
regard
to
your
most
kind
and
generous
offer
to
give
to
my
dear
aunt
janet
the
sum
which
i
would
have
given
myself
had
such
been
in
my

you
most

of
course
i
shall
not
mention
the
matter
unless
you
specially
authorize
me
and
myself
but
indeed
i
think
it
will
be
better
not
to
offer
it
aunt
janet
is
very
proud

since

of

he
was
the

third
son
the

patience
having
been
born
twenty
years
after
the
last
of
the
four
sons
concerning
roger
i
shall
put
down
all
i
have
heard
of
him
from
my
father
and
grandfather
from
my
grandaunt
i
heard
nothing
i
was
a
very
small
kid
when
she
died
but
i
remember
seeing
her
but
only
once
a
very
tall
handsome
woman
of
a
little
over
thirty
with
very
dark
hair
and
lightcoloured
eyes
i
think
they
were
either
grey
or
blue
but
i
cant
remember
which
she
looked
very
proud
and
haughty
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
she
was
very
nice
to
me
i
remember
feeling
very
jealous
of
rupert
because
his
mother
looked
so
distinguished
rupert
was
eight
years
older
than
me
and
i
was
afraid
he
would
beat
me
if
i
said
anything
he
did
not
like
so
i
was
silent
except
when
i
forgot
to
be
and
rupert
said
very
unkindly
and
i
think
very
unfairly
that
i
was
a
sulky
little
beast
i
havent
forgot
that
and
i
dont
mean
to
however
it
doesnt
matter
much
what
he
said
or
thought
there
he
isif
he
is
at
allwhere
no
one
can
find
him
with
no
money
or
nothing
for
what
little
he
had
he
settled
when
he
came
of
age
on
the
macskelpie
he
wanted
to
give
it
to
her
when
his
mother
died
but
father
who
was
a
trustee
refused
and
uncle
roger
as
i
call
him
who
is
another
thought
the
trustees
had
no
power
to
allow
rupert
to
throw
away
his
matrimony
as
i
called
it
making
a
joke
to
father
when
he
called
it
patrimony
old
sir
colin
macskelpie
who
is
the
third
said
he
couldnt
take
any
part
in
such
a
permission
as
the
macskelpie
was
his
niece
he
is
a
rude
old
man
that
i
remember
when
not
remembering
his
relationship
i
spoke
of
the
macskelpie
he
caught
me
a
clip
on
the
ear
that
sent
me
across
the
room
his
scotch
is
very
broad
i
can
hear
him
say
hae
some
attempt
at
even
soothern

father
was
i
could
see
very
much
offended
but
he
didnt
say
anything
he
remembered
i
think
that
the
general
is
a
vc
man
and
was
fond
of
fighting
duels
but
to
show
that
the
fault
was
not
his
he
wrung
my
earand
the
same
ear
too
i
suppose
he
thought
that
was
justice
but
its
only
right
to
say
that
he
made
up
for
it
afterwards
when
the
general
had
gone
he
gave
me
a
fivepound
note
i
dont
think
uncle
roger
was
very
pleased
with
the
way
rupert
behaved
about
the
legacy
for
i
dont
think
he
ever
saw
him
from
that
day
to
this
perhaps
of
course
it
was
because
rupert
ran
away
shortly
afterwards
but
i
shall
tell
about
that
when
i
come
to
him
after
all
why
should
my
uncle
bother
about
him
he
is
not
a
melton
at
all
and
i
am
to
be
head
of
the
houseof
course
when
the
lord
thinks
right
to
take
father
to
himself
uncle
roger
has
tons
of
money
and
he
never
married
so
if
he
wants
to
leave
it
in
the
right
direction
he
neednt
have
any
trouble
he
made
his
money
in
what
he
calls
the
eastern
trade
this
so
far
as
i
can
gather
takes
in
the
levant
and
all
east
of
it
i
know
he
has
what
they
call
in
trade
houses
in
all
sorts
of
placesturkey
and
greece
and
all
round
them
morocco
egypt
and
southern
russia
and
the
holy
land
then
on
to
persia
india
and
all
round
it
the
chersonese
china
japan
and
the
pacific
islands
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
we
landowners
can
know
much
about
trade
but
my
uncle
coversor
alas
i
must
say
covereda
lot
of
ground
i
can
tell
you
uncle
roger
was
a
very
grim
sort
of
man
and
only
that
i
was
brought
up
to
try
and
be
kind
to
him
i
shouldnt
ever
have
dared
to
speak
to
him
but
when
was
a
child
father
and
motherespecially
motherforced
me
to
go
and
see
him
and
be
affectionate
to
him
he
wasnt
ever
even
civil
to
me
that
i
can
remembergrumpy
old
bear
but
then
he
never
saw
rupert
at
all
so
that
i
take
it
master
r
is
out
of
the
running
altogether
for
testamentary
honours
the
last
time
i
saw
him
myself
he
was
distinctly
rude
he
treated
me
as
a
boy
though
i
was
getting
on
for
eighteen
years
of
age
i
came
into
his
office
without
knocking
and
without
looking
up
from
his
desk
where
he
was
writing
he
said
get
out
why
do
you
venture
to
disturb
me
when
im
busy
get
out
and
be
damned
to
you
i
waited
where
i
was
ready
to
transfix
him
with
my
eye
when
he
should
look
up
for
i
cannot
forget
that
when
my
father
dies
i
shall
be
head
of
my
house
but
when
he
did
there
was
no
transfixing
possible
he
said
quite
coolly
oh
its
you
is
it
i
thought
it
was
one
of
my
office
boys
sit
down
if
you
want
to
see
me
and
wait
till
i
am
ready
so
i
sat
down
and
waited
father
always
said
that
i
should
try
to
conciliate
and
please
my
uncle
father
is
a
very
shrewd
man
and
uncle
roger
is
a
very
rich
one
but
i
dont
think
uncle
r
is
as
shrewd
as
he
thinks
he
is
he
sometimes
makes
awful
mistakes
in
business
for
instance
some
years
ago
he
bought
an
enormous
estate
on
the
adriatic
in
the
country
they
call
the
land
of
blue
mountains
at
least
he
says
he
bought
it
he
told
father
so
in
confidence
but
he
didnt
show
any
titledeeds
and
im
greatly
afraid
he
was
had
a
bad
job
for
me
that
he
was
for
father
believes
he
paid
an
enormous
sum
for
it
and
as
i
am
his
natural
heir
it
reduces
his
available
estate
to
so
much
less
and
now
about
rupert
as
i
have
said
he
ran
away
when
he
was
about
fourteen
and
we
did
not
hear
about
him
for
years
when
weor
rather
my
fatherdid
hear
of
him
it
was
no
good
that
he
heard
he
had
gone
as
a
cabinboy
on
a
sailing
ship
round
the
horn
then
he
joined
an
exploring
party
through
the
centre
of
patagonia
and
then
another
up
in
alaska
and
a
third
to
the
aleutian
islands
after
that
he
went
through
central
america
and
then
to
western
africa
the
pacific
islands
india
and
a
lot
of
places
we
all
know
the
wisdom
of
the
adage
that
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
and
certainly
if
there
be
any
value
in
moss
cousin
rupert
will
die
a
poor
man
indeed
nothing
will
stand
his
idiotic
boastful
wastefulness
look
at
the
way
in
which
when
he
came
of
age
he
made
over
all
his
mothers
little
fortune
to
the
macskelpie
i
am
sure
that
though
uncle
roger
made
no
comment
to
my
father
who
as
head
of
our
house
should
of
course
have
been
informed
he
was
not
pleased
my
mother
who
has
a
good
fortune
in
her
own
right
and
has
had
the
sense
to
keep
it
in
her
own
controlas
i
am
to
inherit
it
and
it
is
not
in
the
entail
i
am
therefore
quite
impartiali
can
approve
of
her
spirited
conduct
in
the
matter
we
never
did
think
much
of
rupert
anyhow
but
now
since
he
is
in
the
way
to
be
a
pauper
and
therefore
a
dangerous
nuisance
we
look
on
him
as
quite
an
outsider
we
know
what
he
really
is
for
my
own
part
i
loathe
and
despise
him
just
now
we
are
irritated
with
him
for
we
are
all
kept
on
tenterhooks
regarding
my
dear
uncle
rogers
will
for
mr
trent
the
attorney
who
regulated
my
dear
uncles
affairs
and
has
possession
of
the
will
says
it
is
necessary
to
know
where
every
possible
beneficiary
is
to
be
found
before
making
the
will
public
so
we
all
have
to
wait
it
is
especially
hard
on
me
who
am
the
natural
heir
it
is
very
thoughtless
indeed
of
rupert
to
keep
away
like
that
i
wrote
to
old
macskelpie
about
it
but
he
didnt
seem
to
understand
or
to
be
at
all
anxioushe
is
not
the
heir
he
said
that
probably
rupert
sent
legerhe
too
keeps
to
the
old
spellingdid
not
know
of
his
uncles
death
or
he
would
have
taken
steps
to
relieve
our
anxiety
our
anxiety
forsooth
we
are
not
anxious
we
only
wish
to
know
and
if
weand
especially
mewho
have
all
the
annoyance
of
thinking
of
the
detestable
and
unfair
deathduties
are
anxious
we
should
be
so
well
anyhow
hell
get
a
properly
bitter
disappointment
and
set
down
when
he
does
turn
up
and
discovers
that
he
is
a
pauper
without
hope





today
we
father
and
i
had
letters
from
mr
trent
telling
us
that
the
whereabouts
of
mr
rupert
sent
leger
had
been
discovered
and
that
a
letter
disclosing
the
fact
of
poor
uncle
rogers
death
had
been
sent
to
him
he
was
at
titicaca
when
last
heard
of
so
goodness
only
knows
when
he
may
get
the
letter
which
asks
him
to
come
home
at
once
but
only
gives
to
him
such
information
about
the
will
as
has
already
been
given
to
every
member
of
the
testators
family
and
that
is
nil
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
kept
waiting
for
months
before
we
get
hold
of
the
estate

is

1907
the
reading
of
uncle
rogers
will
is
over
father
got
a
duplicate
of
mr
trents
letter
to
me
and
of
the
cable
and
two
telegrams
pasted
into
this
record
we
both
waited
patiently
till
the
thirdthat
is
we
did
not
say
anything
the
only
impatient
member
of
our
family
was
my
mother
she
did
say
things
and
if
old
trent
had
been
here
his
ears
would
have
been
red
she
said
what
ridiculous
nonsense
it
was
delaying
the
reading
of
the
will
and
keeping
the
heir
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
an
obscure
person
who
wasnt
even
a
member
of
the
family
inasmuch
as
he
didnt
bear
the
name
i
dont
think
its
quite
respectful
to
one
who
is
some
day
to
be
head
of
the
house
i
thought
father
was
weakening
in
his
patience
when
he
said
true
my
deartrue
and
got
up
and
left
the
room
some
time
afterwards
when
i
passed
the
library
i
heard
him
walking
up
and
down
father
and
i
went
up
to
town
on
the
afternoon
of
wednesday
january
2
we
stayed
of
course
at
claridges
where
we
always
stay
when
we
go
to
town
mother
wanted
to
come
too
but
father
thought
it
better
not
she
would
not
agree
to
stay
at
home
till
we
both
promised
to
send
her
separate
telegrams
after
the
reading
at
five
minutes
to
eleven
we
entered
mr
trents
office
father
would
not
go
a
moment
earlier
as
he
said
it
was
bad
form
to
seem
eager
at
any
time
but
most
of
all
at
the
reading
of
a
will
it
was
a
rotten
grind
for
we
had
to
be
walking
all
over
the
neighbourhood
for
half
an
hour
before
it
was
time
not
to
be
too
early
when
we
went
into
the
room
we
found
there
general
sir
colin
mackelpie
and
a
big
man
very
bronzed
whom
i
took
to
be
rupert
st
legernot
a
very
creditable
connection
to
look
at
i
thought
he
and
old
mackelpie
took
care
to
be
in
time
rather
low
i
thought
it
mr
st
leger
was
reading
a
letter
he
had
evidently
come
in
but
lately
for
though
he
seemed
to
be
eager
about
it
he
was
only
at
the
first
page
and
i
could
see
that
there
were
many
sheets
he
did
not
look
up
when
we
came
in
or
till
he
had
finished
the
letter
and
you
may
be
sure
that
neither
i
nor
my
father
who
as
head
of
the
house
should
have
had
more
respect
from
him
took
the
trouble
to
go
to
him
after
all
he
is
a
pauper
and
a
wastrel
and
he
has
not
the
honour
of
bearing
our
name
the
general
however
came
forward
and
greeted
us
both
cordially
he
evidently
had
forgottenor
pretended
to
havethe
discourteous
way
he
once
treated
me
for
he
spoke
to
me
quite
in
a
friendly
wayi
thought
more
warmly
than
he
did
to
father
i
was
pleased
to
be
spoken
to
so
nicely
for
after
all
whatever
his
manners
may
be
he
is
a
distinguished
manhas
won
the
vc
and
a
baronetcy
he
got
the
latter
not
long
ago
after
the
frontier
war
in
india
i
was
not
however
led
away
into
cordiality
myself
i
had
not
forgotten
his
rudeness
and
i
thought
that
he
might
be
sucking
up
to
me
i
knew
that
when
i
had
my
dear
uncle
rogers
many
millions
i
should
be
a
rather
important
person
and
of
course
he
knew
it
too
so
i
got
even
with
him
for
his
former
impudence
when
he
held
out
his
hand
i
put
one
finger
in
it
and
said
how
do
he
got
very
red
and
turned
away
father
and
he
had
ended
by
glaring
at
each
other
so
neither
of
us
was
sorry
to
be
done
with
him
all
the
time
mr
st
leger
did
not
seem
to
see
or
hear
anything
but
went
on
reading
his
letter
i
thought
the
old
macskelpie
was
going
to
bring
him
into
the
matter
between
us
for
as
he
turned
away
i
heard
him
say
something
under
his
breath
it
sounded
like
help
but
mr
s
did
not
hear
he
certainly
no
notice
of
it
as
the
macs
and
mr
s
sat
quite
silent
neither
looking
at
us
and
as
father
was
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
as
i
wanted
to
show
that
i
was
indifferent
to
the
two
ss
i
took
out
this
notebook
and
went
on
with
the
record
bringing
it
up
to
this
moment
the
recordcontinued
when
i
had
finished
writing
i
looked
over
at
rupert
when
he
saw
us
he
jumped
up
and
went
over
to
father
and
shook
his
hand
quite
warmly
father
took
him
very
coolly
rupert
however
did
not
seem
to
see
it
but
came
towards
me
heartily
i
happened
to
be
doing
something
else
at
the
moment
and
at
first
i
did
not
see
his
hand
but
just
as
i
was
looking
at
it
the
clock
struck
eleven
whilst
it
was
striking
mr
trent
came
into
the
room
close
behind
him
came
his
clerk
carrying
a
locked
tin
box
there
were
two
other
men
also
he
bowed
to
us
all
in
turn
beginning
with
me
i
was
standing
opposite
the
door
the
others
were
scattered
about
father
sat
still
but
sir
colin
and
mr
st
leger
rose
mr
trent
not
did
shake
hands
with
any
of
usnot
even
me
nothing
but
his
respectful
bow
that
is
the
etiquette
for
an
attorney
i
understand
on
such
formal
occasions
he
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
big
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
asked
us
to
sit
round
father
of
course
as
head
of
the
family
took
the
seat
at
his
right
hand
sir
colin
and
st
leger
went
to
the
other
side
the
former
taking
the
seat
next
to
the
attorney
the
general
knows
of
course
that
a
baronet
takes
precedence
at
a
ceremony
i
may
be
a
baronet
some
day
myself
and
have
to
know
these
things
the
clerk
took
the
key
which
his
master
handed
to
him
opened
the
tin
box
and
took
from
it
a
bundle
of
papers
tied
with
red
tape
this
he
placed
before
the
attorney
and
put
the
empty
box
behind
him
on
the
floor
then
he
and
the
other
man
sat
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
the
latter
took
out
a
big
notebook
and
several
pencils
and
put
them
before
him
he
was
evidently
a
shorthandwriter
mr
trent
removed
the
tape
from
the
bundle
of
papers
which
he
placed
a
little
distance
in
front
of
him
he
took
a
sealed
envelope
from
the
top
broke
the
seal
opened
the
envelope
and
from
it
took
a
parchment
in
the
folds
of
which
were
some
sealed
envelopes
which
he
laid
in
a
heap
in
front
of
the
other
paper
then
he
unfolded
the
parchment
and
laid
it
before
him
with
the
outside
page
up
he
fixed
his
glasses
and
said

to
arrange
a
time
when
we
may
meet
to
do
so
and
you
also
mr
sent
leger
as
there
is
this
letter
to
submit
to
you
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
open
it
in
the
presence
of
the
executors
but
there
is
no
necessity
that
anyone
else
should
be
present
the
first
to
speak
was
my
father
of
course
as
a
county
gentleman
of
position
and
estate
who
is
sometimes
asked
to
take
the
chair
at
sessionsof
course
when
there
is
not
anyone
with
a
title
presenthe
found
himself
under
the
duty
of
expressing
himself
first
old
mackelpie
has
superior
rank
but
this
was
a
family
affair
in
which
my
father
is
head
of
the
house
whilst
old
mackelpie
is
only
an
outsider
brought
into
itand
then
only
to
the
distaff
side
by
the
wife
of
a
younger
brother
of
the
man
who
married
into
our
family
father
spoke
with
the
same
look
on
his
face
as
when
he
asks
important
questions
of
witnesses
at
quarter
sessions
i
should
like
some
points
elucidated
the
attorney
bowed
he
gets
his
120
thou
any
way
so
he
can
afford
to
be
oilysuave
i
suppose
he
would
call
it
so
father
looked
at
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
asked
how
much
is
the
amount
of
the
whole
estate
the
attorney
answered
quickly
and
i
thought
rather
rudely
he
was
red
in
the
face
and
didnt
bow
this
time
i
suppose
a
man
of
his
class
hasnt
more
than
a
very
limited
stock
of
manners
that
sir
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
and
i
may
say
that
i
would
not
if
i
could
is
it
a
million
said
father
again
he
was
angry
this
time
and
even
redder
than
the
old
attorney
the
attorney
said
in
answer
very
quietly
this
time
ah
thats
crossexamining
let
me
say
sir
that
no
one
can
know
that
until
the
accountants
to
be
appointed
for
the
purpose
have
examined
the
affairs
of
the
testator
up
to
date
mr
rupert
st
leger
who
was
looking
all
this
time
angrier
than
even
the
attorney
or
my
fatherthough
at
what
he
had
to
be
angry
about
i
cant
imaginestruck
his
fist
on
the
table
and
rose
up
as
if
to
speak
but
as
he
caught
sight
of
both
old
mackelpie
and
the
attorney
he
sat
down
again
memthose
three
seem
to
agree
too
well
i
must
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
them
i
didnt
think
of
this
part
any
more
at
the
time
for
father
asked
another
question
which
interested
me
much
may
i
ask
why
the
other
matters
of
the
will
are
not
shown
to
us
the
attorney
wiped
his
spectacles
carefully
with
a
big
silk
bandanna
handkerchief
before
he
answered
simply
because
each
of
the
two
letters
marked
b
and
c
is
enclosed
with
instructions
regarding
their
opening
and
the
keeping
secret
of
their
contents
i
shall
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
both

are

that
the

when
the
attorney
had
finished
reading
the
last
letter
he
put
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
then
he
took
the
other
letter
in
his
hand
and
stood
up
mr
rupert
sent
leger
he
said
please
to
open
this

and
in
such
a
way
that
all
present
may
see
that
the

as

rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
cuffs
just
as
if
he
was
going
to
perform
some
sort
of
prestidigitationit
was
very
theatrical
and
ridiculousthen
his
wrists
being
quite
bare
he
opened
the
envelope
and
took
out
the
letter
we
all
saw
it
quite
well
it
was
folded
with
the
first
page
outward
and
on
the
top
was
written
a
line
just
as
the
attorney
said
in
obedience
to
a
request
from
the
attorney
he
laid
both
letter
and
envelope
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
the
clerk
then
rose
up
and
after
handing
a
piece
of
paper
to
the
attorney
went
back
to
his
seat
mr
trent
having
written
something
on
the
paper
asked
us
all
who
were
present
even
the
clerk
and
the
shorthand
man
to
look
at
the
memorandum
on
the
letter
and
what
was
written
on
the
envelope
and
to
sign
the
paper
which
ran
we
the
signatories
of
this
paper
hereby
declare
that
we
have
seen
the
sealed
letter
marked
b
and
enclosed
in
the
will
of
roger
melton
opened
in
the
presence
of
us
all
including
mr
edward
bingham
trent
and
sir
colin
alexander
mackelpie
and
we
declare
that
the
paper
therein
contained
was
headed
b
to
be
read
as
clause
ten
of
my
will
and
that
there
were
no
other
contents
in
the
envelope
in
attestation
of
which
we
in
the
presence
of
each
other
append
our
signatures
the
attorney
motioned
to
my
father
to
begin
father
is
a
cautious
man
and
he
asked
for
a
magnifyingglass
which
was
shortly
brought
to
him
by
a
clerk
for
whom
the
clerk
in
the
room
called
father
examined
the
envelope
all
over
very
carefully
and
also
the
memorandum
at
top
of
the
paper
then
without
a
word
he
signed
the
paper
father
is
a
just
man
then
we
all
signed
the
attorney
folded
the
paper
and
put
it
in
an
envelope
before
closing
it
he
passed
it
round
and
we
all
saw
that
it
had
not
been
tampered
with
father
took
it
out
and
read
it
and
then
put
it
back
then
the
attorney
asked
us
all
to
sign
it
across
the
flap
which
we
did
then
he
put
the
sealingwax
on
it
and
asked
father
to
seal
it
with
his
own
seal
he
did
so
then
he
and
mackelpie
sealed
it
also
with
their
own
seals
then
he
put
it
in
another
envelope
which
he
sealed
himself
and
he
and
mackelpie
signed
it
across
the
flap
then
father
stood
up
and
so
did
i
so
did
the
two
menthe
clerk
and
the
shorthand
writer
father
did
not
say
a
word
till
we
got
out
into
the
street
we
walked
along
and
presently
we
passed
an
open
gate
into
the
fields
he
turned
back
saying
to
me
come
in
here
there
is
no
one
about
and
we
can
be
quiet
i
want
to
speak
to
you
when
we
sat
down
on
a
seat
with
none
other
near
it
father
said
you
are
a
student
of
the
law
what
does
all
that
mean
i
thought
it
a
good
occasion
for
an
epigram
so
i
said
one
word
bilk
hm
said
father
that
is
so
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
you
with
a
beggarly
ten
thousand
and
i
with
twenty
but
what
is
or
will
be
the
effect
of
those
secret
trusts
oh
that
i
said
will
i
dare
say
be
all
right
uncle
roger
evidently
did
not
intend
the
older
generation
to
benefit
too
much
by
his
death
but
he
only
gave
rupert
st
leger
one
thousand
pounds
whilst
he
gave
me
ten
that
looks
as
if
he
had
more
regard
for
the
direct
line
of
course
father
interrupted
me
but
what
was
the
meaning
of
a
further
sum
i
dont
know
father
there
was
evidently
some
condition
which
he
was
to
fulfil
but
he
evidently
didnt
expect
that
he
would
why
otherwise
did
he
leave
a
second
trust
to
mr
trent
true
said
father
then
he
went
on
i
wonder
why
he
left
those
enormous
sums
to
trent
and
old
mackelpie
they
seem
out
of
all
proportion
as
executors
fees
unless
unless
what
father
unless
the
fortune
he
has
left
is
an
enormous
one
that
is
why
i
asked
and
that
i
laughed
is
why
he
refused
to
answer
why
ernest
it
must
run
into
big
figures
rightho
father
the
deathduties
will
be
annoying
what
a
beastly
swindle
the
deathduties
are
why
i
shall
suffer
even
on
your
own
little
estate




that
will
do
he
said
curtly
father
is
so
ridiculously
touchy
one
would
think
he
expects
to
live
for
ever
presently
he
spoke
again
i
wonder
what
are
the
conditions
of
that
trust
they
are
as
importantalmostas
the
amount
of
the
bequestwhatever
it
is
by
the
way
there
seems
to
be
no
mention
in
the
will
of
a
residuary
legatee
ernest
my
boy
we
may
have
to
fight
over
that
how
do
you
make
that
out
father
i
asked
he
had
been
very
rude
over
the
matter
of
the
deathduties
of
his
own
estate
though
it
is
entailed
and
i
must
inherit
so
i
determined
to
let
him
see
that
i
know
a
good
deal
more
than
he
doesof
law
at
any
rate
i
fear
that
when
we
come
to
look
into
it
closely
that
dog
wont
fight
in
the
first
place
that
may
be
all
arranged
in
the
letter
to
st
leger
which
is
a
part
of
the
will
and
if
that
letter
should
be
inoperative
by
his
refusal
of
the
conditions
whatever
they
may
be
then
the
letter
to
the
attorney
begins
to
work
what
it
is
we
dont
know
and
perhaps
even
he
doesnti
looked
at
it
as
well
as
i
couldand
we
law
men
are
trained
to
observation
but
even
if
the
instructions
mentioned
as
being
in
letter
c
fail
then
the
corpus
of
the
will
gives
full
power
to
trent
to
act
just
as
he
darn
pleases
he
can
give
the
whole
thing
to
himself
if
he
likes
and
no
one
can
say
a
word
in
fact
he
is
himself
the
final
court
of
appeal
hm
said
father
to
himself
it
is
a
queer
kind
of
will
i
take
it
that
can
override
the
court
of
chancery
we
shall
perhaps
have
to
try
it
before
we
are
done
with
this
with
that
he
rose
and
we
walked
home
togetherwithout
saying
another
word
my
mother
was
very
inquisitive
about
the
whole
thingwomen
always
are
father
and
i
between
us
told
her
all
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
know
i
think
we
were
both
afraid
that
womanlike
she
would
make
trouble
for
us
by
saying
or
doing
something
injudicious
indeed
she
manifested
such
hostility
towards
rupert
st
leger
that
it
is
quite
on
the

all
concerned
in
the
will
and
estate
of
the
late
roger
melton
of
openshaw
grange

so
vast
that
in
case
any
litigation
should
take
place
regarding
the

i
as
the
solicitor
having
the
carriage

wishes
think
it
well
to
make
certain
memoranda

conversations

not
covered
by

evidence
i
make
the

memorandum

after
the

whilst
every
detail
of
act
and
conversation
is
still
fresh
in
my
mind
i
shall
also
try
to
make
such
comments
thereon
as
may
serve
to
refresh
my
memory
hereafter
and
which
in

may
perhaps
afford
as
opinions

when
the
will
had
been
read
mr
e
h
melton
asked
the
value
of
the
estate
left
by
the
testator
which
query
i
did
not
feel
empowered
or
otherwise
able
to
answer
and
a
further
query
as
to
why
those
present
were
not
shown
the
secret
clauses
of
the
will
i
answered
by
reading
the
instructions
endorsed
on
the
envelopes
of
the
two
letters
marked
b
and
c
which
were
sufficiently
explanatory
but
lest
any
question
should
hereafter
arise
as
to
the
fact
that
the
memoranda
in
letters
marked
b
and
c
which
were
to
be
read
as
clauses
10
and
11
of
the
will
i
caused
rupert
sent
leger
to
open
the
envelope
marked
b
in
the
presence
of
all
in
the
room
these
all
signed
a
paper
which
i
had
already
prepared
to
the
effect
that
they
had
seen
the
envelope
opened
and
that
the
memorandum
marked
b
to
be
read
as
clause
ten
of
my
will
was
contained
in
the
envelope
of
which
it
was
to
be
the
sole
contents
mr
ernest
halbard
melton
jp
before
signing
carefully
examined
with
a
magnifyingglass
for
which
he
had
asked
both
the
envelope
and
the
heading
of
the
memorandum
enclosed
in
the
letter
he
was
about
to
turn
the
folded
paper
which
was
lying
on
the
table
over
by
which
he
might
have
been
able
to
read
the
matter
of
the
memorandum
had
he
so
desired
i
at
once
advised
him
that
the
memorandum
he
was
to
sign
dealt
only
with
the
heading
of
the
page
and
not
with
the
matter
he
looked
very
angry
but
said
nothing
and
after
a
second
scrutiny
signed
i
put
the
memorandum
in
an
envelope
which
we
all
signed
across
the
flap
before
signing
mr
ernest
halbard
melton
took
out
the
paper
and
verified
it
i
then
asked
him
to
close
it
which
he
did
and
when
the
sealingwax
was
on
it
he
sealed
it
with
his
own
seal
sir
colin
a
mackelpie
and
i
also
appended
our
own
seals
i
put
the
envelope
in
another
which
i
sealed
with
my
own
seal
and
my
coexecutor
and
i
signed
it
across
the
flap
and
added
the
date
i
took
charge
of
this
when
the
others
present
had
taken
their
departure
my
coexecutor
and
i
together
with
mr
rupert
sent
leger
who
had
remained
at
my
request
went
into
my
private
room
here
mr
rupert
sent
leger
read
the
memorandum
marked
b
which
is
to
be
read
as
clause
10
of
the
will
he
is
evidently
a
man
of
considerable
nerve
for
his
face
was
quite
impassive
as
he
read
the
document
which
conveyed
to
him
subject
to
the
conditions
laid
down
a
fortune
which
has
no
equal
in
amount
in
europe
even
so
far
as
i
know
amongst
the
crowned
heads
when
he
had
read
it
over
a
second
time
he
stood
up
and
said
i
wish
i
had
known
my
uncle
better
he
must
have
had
the
heart
of
a
king
i
never
heard
of
such
generosity
as
he
has
shown
me
mr
trent
i
see
from
the
conditions
of
this
memorandum
or
codicil
or
whatever
it
is
that
i
am
to
declare
within
a
week
as
to
whether
i
accept
the
conditions
imposed
on
me
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
this
must
i
wait
a
week
to
declare
in
answer
i
told
him
that
the
testators
intention
was
manifestly
to
see
that
he
had
full
time
to
consider
fully
every
point
before
making
formal
decision
and
declaration
but
in
answer
to
the
specific
question
i
could
answer
that
he
might
make
declaration
when
he
would
provided
it
was
within
or
rather
not
after
the
week
named
i
added
but
i
strongly
advise
you
not
to
act
hurriedly
so
enormous
a
sum
is
involved
that
you
may
be
sure
that
all
possible
efforts
will
be
made
by
someone
or
other
to
dispossess
you
of
your
inheritance
and
it
will
be
well
that
everything
shall
be
done
not
only
in
perfect
order
but
with
such
manifest
care
and
deliberation
that
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
your
intention
thank
you
sir
he
answered
i
shall
do
as
you
shall
kindly
advise
me
in
this
as
in
other
things
but
i
may
tell
you
nowand
you
too
my
dear
sir
colinthat
i
not
only
accept
my
uncle
rogers
conditions
in
this
but
that
when
the
time
comes
in
the
other
matters
i
shall
accept
every
condition
that
he
had
in
his
mindand
that
i
may
know
ofin
everything
he
looked
exceedingly
in
earnest
and
it
gave
me
much
pleasure
to
see
and
hear
him
it
was
just
what
a
young
man
should
do
who
had
seen
so
generously
treated
as
the
time
had
now
come
i
gave
him
the
bulky
letter
addressed
to
him
marked
d
which
i
had
in
my
safe
as
i
fulfilled
my
obligation
in
the
matter
i
said
you
need
not
read
the
letter
here
you
can
take
it
away
with
you
and
read
it
by
yourself
at
leisure
it
is
your
own
property
without
any
obligation
whatever
attached
to
it
by
the
way
perhaps
it
would
be
well
if
you
knew
i
have
a
copy
sealed
up
in
an
envelope
and
endorsed
to

my
dear
nephew
when
if
ever
you
receive
this
you
will
know
that
with
the
exception
of
some
definite
bequests
i
have
left
to
you
under
certain
conditions
the
entire
bulk
of
my
fortunea
fortune
so
great
that
by
its
aid
as
a
help
a
man
of
courage
and
ability
may
carve
out
for
himself
a
name
and
place
in
history
the
specific
conditions
contained
in
clause
10
of
my
will
have
to
be
observed
for
such
i
deem
to
be
of
service
to
your
own
fortune
but
herein
i
give
my
advice
which
you
are
at
liberty
to
follow
or
not
as
you
will
and
my
wishes
which
i
shall
try
to
explain
fully
and
clearly
so
that
you
may
be
in
possession
of
my
views
in
case
you
should
desire
to
carry
them
out
or
at
least
to
so
endeavour
that
the
results
i
hope
for
may
be
ultimately
achieved
first
let
me
explainfor
your
understanding
and
your
guidancethat
the
power
or
perhaps
it
had
better
be
called
the
pressure
behind
the
accumulation
of
my
fortune
has
been
ambition
in
obedience
to
its
compulsion
i
toiled
early
and
late
until
i
had
so
arranged
matters
that
subject
to
broad
supervision
my
ideas
could
be
carried
out
by
men
whom
i
had
selected
and
tested
and
not
found
wanting
this
was
for
years
to
the
satisfaction
and
ultimately
to
the
accumulation
by
these
men
of
fortune
commensurate
in
some
measure
to
their
own
worth
and
their
importance
to
my
designs
thus
i
had
accumulated
whilst
still
a
young
man
a
considerable
fortune
this
i
have
for
over
forty
years
used
sparingly
as
regards
my
personal
needs
daringly
with
regard
to
speculative
investments
with
the
latter
i
took
such
very
great
care
studying
the
conditions
surrounding
them
so
thoroughly
that
even
now
my
schedule
of
bad
debts
or
unsuccessful
investments
is
almost
a
blank
perhaps
by
such
means
things
flourished
with
me
and
wealth
piled
in
so
fast
that
at
times
i
could
hardly
use
it
to
advantage
this
was
all
done
as
the
forerunner
of
ambition
but
i
was
over
fifty
years
of
age
when
the
horizon
of
ambition
itself
opened
up
to
me
i
speak
thus
freely
my
dear
rupert
as
when
you
read
it
i
shall
have
passed
away
and
not
ambition
nor
the
fear
of
misunderstanding
nor
even
of
scorn
can
touch
me
my
ventures
in
commerce
and
finance
covered
not
only
the
far
east
but
every
foot
of
the
way
to
it
so
that
the
mediterranean
and
all
its
opening
seas
were
familiar
to
me
in
my
journeyings
up
and
down
the
adriatic
i
was
always
struck
by
the
great
beauty
and
seeming
richnessnative
richnessof
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
at
last
chance
took
me
into
that
delectable
region
when
the
balkan
struggle
of
90
was
on
one
of
the
great
voivodes
came
to
me
in
secret
to
arrange
a
large
loan
for
national
purposes
it
was
known
in
financial
circles
of
both
europe
and
asia
that
i
took
an
active
part
in
the
haute
politique
of
national
treasuries
and
the
voivode
vissarion
came
to
me
as
to
one
able
and
willing
to
carry
out
his
wishes
after
confidential
pourparlers
he
explained
to
me
that
his
nation
was
in
the
throes
of
a
great
crisis
as
you
perhaps
know
the
gallant
little
nation
in
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
has
had
a
strange
history
for
more
than
a
thousand
yearsever
since
its
settlement
after
the
disaster
of
rossoroit
had
maintained
its
national
independence
under
several
forms
of
government
at
first
it
had
a
king
whose
successors
became
so
despotic
that
they
were
dethroned
then
it
was
governed
by
its
voivodes
with
the
combining
influence
of
a
vladika
somewhat
similar
in
power
and
function
to
the
princebishops
of
montenegro
afterwards
by
a
prince
or
as
at
present
by
an
irregular
elective
council
influenced
in
a
modified
form
by
the
vladika
who
was
then
supposed
to
exercise
a
purely
spiritual
function
such
a
council
in
a
small
poor
nation
did
not
have
sufficient
funds
for
armaments
which
were
not
immediately
and
imperatively
necessary
and
therefore
the
voivode
vissarion
who
had
vast
estates
in
his
own
possession
and
who
was
the
present
representative
a
family
which
of
old
had
been
leaders
in
the
land
found
it
a
duty
to
do
on
his
own
account
that
which
the
state
could
not
do
for
security
as
to
the
loan
which
he
wished
to
get
and
which
was
indeed
a
vast
one
he
offered
to
sell
me
his
whole
estate
if
i
would
secure
to
him
a
right
to
repurchase
it
within
a
given
time
a
time
which
i
may
say
has
some
time
ago
expired
he
made
it
a
condition
that
the
sale
and
agreement
should
remain
a
strict
secret
between
us
as
a
widespread
knowledge
that
his
estate
had
changed
hands
would
in
all
probability
result
in
my
death
and
his
own
at
the
hands
of
the
mountaineers
who
are
beyond
everything
loyal
and
were
jealous
to
the
last
degree
an
attack
by
turkey
was
feared
and
new
armaments
were
required
and
the
patriotic
voivode
was
sacrificing
his
own
great
fortune
for
the
public
good
what
a
sacrifice
this
was
he
well
knew
for
in
all
discussions
regarding
a
possible
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
blue
mountains
it
was
always
taken
for
granted
that
if
the
principles
of
the
constitution
should
change
to
a
more
personal
rule
his
own
family
should
be
regarded
as
the
most
noble
it
had
ever
been
on
the
side
of
freedom
in
olden
time
before
the
establishment
of
the
council
or
even
during
the
rule
of
the
voivodes
the
vissarion
had
every
now
and
again
stood
out
against
the
king
or
challenged
the
princedom
the
very
name
stood
for
freedom
for
nationality
against
foreign
oppression
and
the
bold
mountaineers
were
devoted
to
it
as
in
other
free
countries
men
follow
the
flag
such
loyalty
was
a
power
and
a
help
in
the
land
for
it
knew
danger
in
every
form
and
anything
which
aided
the
cohesion
of
its
integers
was
a
natural
asset
on

side

in

looked
with

on
the
land
which
was
in
itself
a
vast
natural
fortress
having
close
under
its
shelter
perhaps
the
finest
harbour
between
gibraltar
and
the
dardanelles
but
the
fierce
hardy
mountaineers
were
unconquerable
for
centuries
they
had
fought
with
a
fervour
and
fury
that
nothing
could
withstand
or
abate
attacks
on
their
independence

after

unquenchable
fire
of

had
had
its
effect
one
and
all
the
great
powers
knew
that
to
conquer
that
little
nation
would
be
no
mean
task
but
rather
that
of
a
tireless
giant
over
and
over
again
had
they
fought
with
units
against
hundreds
never
ceasing
until
they
had
either
wiped
out
their
foes
entirely
or
seen
them
retreat
across
the
frontier
in
diminished
numbers
for
many
years
past
however
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
had
remained
unassailable
for
all
the
powers
and
states
had
feared
lest
the
others
should
unite
against
the
one
who
should
begin
the
attack
at
the
time
i
speak
of
there
was
a
feeling
throughout
the
blue
mountainsand
indeed
elsewherethat
turkey
was
preparing
for
a
war
of
offence
the
objective
of
her
attack
was
not
known
anywhere
but
here
there
was
evidence
that
the
turkish
bureau
of
spies
was
in
active
exercise
towards
their
sturdy
little
neighbour
to
prepare
for
this
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
approached
me
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
sinews
of
war
the
situation
was
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
elective
council
was
at
present
largely
held
together
by
the
old
greek
church
which
was
the
religion
of
the
people
and
which
had
had
since
the
beginning
its
destinies
linked
in
a
large
degree
with
theirs
thus
it
was
possible
that
if
a
war
should
break
out
it
might
easily
becomewhatever
might
have
been
its
cause
or
beginningsa
war
of
creeds
this
in
the
balkans
must
be
largely
one
of
races
the
end
of
which
no
mind
could
diagnose
or
even
guess
at
i
had
now
for
some
time
had
knowledge
of
the
country
and
its
people
and
had
come
to
love
them
both
the
nobility
of
vissarions
selfsacrifice
at
once
appealed
to
me
and
i
felt
that
i
too
should
like
to
have
a
hand
in
the
upholding
of
such
a
land
and
such
a
people
they
both
deserved
freedom
when
vissarion
handed
me
the
completed
deed
of
sale
i
was
going
to
tear
it
up
but
he
somehow
recognized
my
intention
and
forestalled
it
he
held
up
his
hand
arrestingly
as
he
said
i
recognize
your
purpose
and
believe
me
i
honour
you
for
it
from
the
very
depths
of
my
soul
but
my
friend
it
must
not
be
our
mountaineers
are
proud
beyond
belief
though
they
would
allow
mewho
am
one
of
themselves
and
whose
fathers
have
been
in
some
way
leaders
and
spokesmen
amongst
them
for
many
centuriesto
do
all
that
is
in
my
power
to
doand
what
each
and
all
they
would
be
glad
to
do
were
the
call
to
themthey
would
not
accept
aid
from
one
outside
themselves
my
good
friend
they
would
resent
it
and
might
show
to
you
who
wish
us
all
so
well
active
hostility
which
might
end
in
danger
or
even
death
that
was
why
my
friend
i
asked
to
put
a
clause
in
our
agreement
that
i
might
have
right
to
repurchase
my
estate
regarding
which
you
would
fain
act
so
generously
thus
it
is
my
dear
nephew
rupert
only
son
of
my
dear
sister
that
i
hereby
charge
you
solemnly
as
you
value
meas
you
value
yourselfas
you
value
honour
that
should
it
ever
become
known
that
that
noble
voivode
peter
vissarion
imperilled
himself
for
his
countrys
good
and
if
it
be
of
danger
or
evil
repute
to
him
that
even
for
such
a
purpose
he
sold
his
heritage
you
shall
at
once
and
to
the
knowledge
of
the
mountaineersthough
not
necessarily
to
othersreconvey
to
him
or
his
heirs
the
freehold
that
he
was
willing
to
part
withand
that
he
has
de
facto
parted
with
by
the
effluxion
of
the
time
during
which
his
right
of
repurchase
existed
this
is
a
secret
trust
and
duty
which
is
between
thee
and
me
alone
in
the
first
instance
a
duty
which
i
have
undertaken
on
behalf
of
my
heirs
and
which
must
be
carried
out
at
whatsoever
cost
may
ensue
you
must
not
take
it
that
it
is
from
any
mistrust
of
you
or
belief
that
you
will
fail
that
i
have
taken
another
measure
to
insure
that
this
my
cherished
idea
is
borne
out
indeed
it
is
that
the
law
may

of
needfor
no
man

know
what
may

after
his
own

taken
from
the
ploughbe
complied
with
that
i
have
in
another
letter
written
for
the
guidance
of
others
directed
that
in
case
of
any
failure
to
carry
out
this

or
otherthe
direction
become
a
clause
or
codicil
to
my
will
but
in
the
meantime
i
wish
that
this
be
kept
a
secret
between
us
two
to
show
you
the
full
extent
of
my
confidence
let
me
here
tell
you
that
the
letter
alluded
to
above
is
marked
c
and
directed
to
my
solicitor
and
coexecutor
edward
bingham
trent
which
is
finally
to
be
regarded
as
clause
eleven
of
my
will
to
which
end
he
has
my
instructions
and
also
a
copy
of
this
letter
which
is
in
case
of
need
and
that
only
to
be
opened
and
is
to
be
a
guide
to
my
wishes
as
to
the
carrying
out
by
you
of
the
conditions
on
which
you
inherit
and
now
my
dear
nephew
let
me
change
to
another
subject
more
dear
to
meyourself
when
you
read
this
i
shall
have
passed
away
so
that
i
need
not
be
hampered
now
by
that
reserve
which
i
feel
has
grown
upon
me
through
a
long
and
selfcontained
life
your
mother
was
very
dear
to
me
as
you
know
she
was
twenty
years
younger
than
her
youngest
brother
who
was
two
years
younger
than
me
so
we
were
all
young
men
when
she
was
a
baby
and
i
need
not
say
a
pet
amongst
usalmost
like
our
own
child
to
each
of
us
as
well
as
our
sister
you
knew
her
sweetness
and
high
quality
so
i
need
say
nothing
of
these
but
i
should
like
you
to
understand
that
she
was
very
dear
to
me
when
she
and
your
father
came
to
know
and
love
each
other
i
was
far
away
opening
up
a
new
branch
of
business
in
the
interior
of
china
and
it
was
not
for
several
months
that
i
got
home
news
when
i
first
heard
of
him
they
had
already
been
married
i
was
delighted
to
find
that
they
were
very
happy
they
needed
nothing
that
i
could
give
when
he
died
so
suddenly
i
tried
to
comfort
her
and
all
i
had
was
at
her
disposal
did
she
want
it
she
was
a
proud
womanthough
not
with
me
she
had
come
to
understand
that
though
i
seemed
cold
and
hard
and
perhaps
was
so
generally
i
was
not
so
to
her
but
she
would
not
have
help
of
any
kind
when
i
pressed
her
she
told
me
that
she
had
enough
for
your
keep
and
education
and
her
own
sustenance
for
the
time
she
must
still
live
that
your
father
and
she
had
agreed
that
you
should
be
brought
up
to
a
healthy
and
strenuous
life
rather
than
to
one
of
luxury
and
she
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
development
of
your
character
that
you
should
learn
to
be
selfreliant
and
to
be
content
with
what
your
dear
father
had
left
you
she
had
always
been
a
wise
and
thoughtful
girl
and
now
all
her
wisdom
and
thought
were
for
you
your
fathers
and
her
child
when
she
spoke
of
you
and
your
future
she
said
many
things
which
i
thought
memorable
one
of
them
i
remember
to
this
day
it
was
apropos
of
my
saying
that
there
is
a
danger
of
its
own
kind
in
extreme
poverty
a
young
man
might
know
too
much
want
she
answered
me
true
that
is
so
but
there
is
a
danger
that
overrides
it
and
after
a
time
went
on
it
is
better
not
to
know
wants
than
not
to
know
want
i
tell
you
boy
that
is
a
great
truth
and
i
hope
you
will
remember
it
for
yourself
as
well
as
a
part
of
the
wisdom
of
your
mother
and
here
let
me
say
something
else
which
is
a
sort
of
corollary
of
that
wise
utterance
i
dare
say
you
thought
me
very
hard
and
unsympathetic
that
time
i
would
not
as
one
of
your
trustees
agree
to
your
transferring
your
little
fortune
to
miss
mackelpie
i
dare
say
you
bear
a
grudge
towards
me
about
it
up
to
this
day
well
if
you
have
any
of
that
remaining
put
it
aside
when
you
know
the
truth
that
request
of
yours
was
an
unspeakable
delight
to
me
it
was
like
your
mother
coming
back
from
the
dead
that
little
letter
of
yours
made
me
wish
for
the
first
time
that
i
had
a
sonand
that
he
should
be
like
you
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
reverie
thinking
if
i
were
yet
too
old
to
marry
so
that
a
son
might
be
with
me
in
my
declining
yearsif
such
were
to
ever
be
for
me
but
i
concluded
that
this
might
not
be
there
was
no
woman
whom
i
knew
or
had
ever
met
with
that
i
could
love
as
your
mother
loved
your
father
and
as
he
loved
her
so
i
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
i
must
go
my
lonely
road
on
to
the
end
and
then
came
a
ray
of
light
into
my
darkness
there
was
you
though
you
might
not
feel
like
a
son
to
mei
could
not
expect
it
when
the
memory
of
that
sweet
relationship
was
more
worthily
filled
but
i
could
feel
like
a
father
to
you
nothing
could
prevent
that
or
interfere
with
it
for
i
would
keep
it
as
my
secret
in
the
very
holy
of
holies
of
my
heart
where
had
been
for
thirty
years
the
image
of
a
sweet
little
childyour
mother
my
boy
when
in
your
future
life
you
shall
have
happiness
and
honour
and
power
i
hope
you
will
sometimes
give
a
thought
to
the
lonely
old
man
whose
later
years
your
very
existence
seemed
to
brighten
the
thought
of
your
mother
recalled
me
to
my
duty
i
had
undertaken
for
her
a
sacred
task
to
carry
out
her
wishes
regarding
her
son
i
knew
how
she
would
have
acted
it
mightwouldhave
been
to
her
a
struggle
of
inclination
and
duty
and
duty
would
have
won
and
so
i
carried
out
my
duty
though
i
tell
you
it
was
a
harsh
and
bitter
task
to
me
at
the
time
but
i
may
tell
you
that
i
have
since
been
glad
when
i
think
of
the
result
i
tried
as
you
may
perhaps
remember
to
carry
out
your
wishes
in
another
way
but
your
letter
put
the
difficulty
of
doing
so
so
clearly
before
me
that
i
had
to
give
it
up
and
let
me
tell
you
that
that
letter
endeared
you
to
me
more
than
ever
i
need
not
tell
you
that
thenceforth
i
followed
your
life
very
closely
when
you
ran
away
to
sea
i
used
in
secret
every
part
of
the
mechanism
of
commerce
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
you
then
until
you
had
reached
your
majority
i
had
a
constant
watch
kept
upon
younot
to
interfere
with
you
in
any
way
but
so
that
i
might
be
able
to
find
you
should
need
arise
when
in
due
course
i
heard
of
your
first
act
on
coming
of
age
i
was
satisfied
i
had
to
know
of
the
carrying
out
of
your
original
intention
towards
janet
mac
kelpie
for
the
securities
had
to
be
transferred
from
that
time
on
i
watchedof
course
through
other
eyesyour
chief
doings
it
would
have
been
a
pleasure
to
me
to
have
been
able
to
help
in
carrying
out
any
hope
or
ambition
of
yours
but
i
realized
that
in
the
years
intervening
between
your
coming
of
age
and
the
present
moment
you
were
fulfilling
your
ideas
and
ambitions
in
your
own
way
and
as
i
shall
try
to
explain
to
you
presently
my
ambitions
also
you
were
of
so
adventurous
a
nature
that
even
my
own
widelyspread
machinery
of
acquiring
informationwhat
i
may
call
my
private
intelligence
departmentwas
inadequate
my
machinery
was
fairly
adequate
for
the
eastin
great
part
at
all
events
but
you
went
north
and
south
and
west
also
and
in
addition
you
essayed
realms
where
commerce
and
purely
real
affairs
have
no
footholdworlds
of
thought
of
spiritual
import
of
psychic
phenomenaspeaking
generally
of
mysteries
as
now
and
again
i
was
baffled
in
my
inquiries
i
had
to
enlarge
my
mechanism
and
to
this
end
startednot
in
my
own
name
of
coursesome
new
magazines
devoted
to
certain
branches
of
inquiry
and
adventure
should
you
ever
care
to
know
more
of
these
things
mr
trent
in
whose
name
the
stock
is
left
will
be
delighted
to
give
you
all
details
indeed
these
stocks
like
all
else
i
have
shall
be
yours
when
the
time
comes
if
you
care
to
ask
for
them
by
means
of
the
journal
of
adventure
the
magazine
of
mystery
occultism
balloon
and
aeroplane
the
submarine
jungle
and
pampas
the
ghost
world
the
explorer
forest
and
island
ocean
and
creek
i
was
often
kept
informed
when
i
should
otherwise
have
been
ignorant
of
your
whereabouts
and
designs
for
instance
when
you
had
disappeared
into
the
forest
of
the
incas
i
got
the
first
whisper
of
your
strange
adventures
and
discoveries
in
the
buried
cities
of
eudori
from
a
correspondent
of
the
journal
of
adventure
long
before
the
details
given
in
the
times
of
the
rocktemple
of
the
primeval
savages
where
only
remained
the
little
dragon
serpents
whose
giant
ancestors
were
rudely
sculptured
on
the
sacrificial
altar
i
well
remember
how
i
thrilled
at
even
that
meagre
account
of
your
going
in
alone
into
that
veritable
hell
it
was
from
occultism
that
i
learned
how
you
had
made
a
stay
alone
in
the
haunted
catacombs
of
elora
in
the
far
recesses
of
the
himalayas
and
of
the
fearful
experiences
which
when
you
came
out
shuddering
and
ghastly
overcame
to
almost
epileptic
fear
those
who
had
banded
themselves
together
to
go
as
far
as
the
rockcut
approach
to
the
hidden
temple
all
such
things
i
read
with
rejoicing
you
were
shaping
yourself
for
a
wider
and
loftier
adventure
which
would
crown
more
worthily
your
matured
manhood
when
i
read
of
you
in
a
description
of
mihask
in
madagascar
and
the
devilworship
there
rarely
held
i
felt
i
had
only
to
wait
for
your
homecoming
in
order
to
broach
the
enterprise
i
had
so
long
contemplated
this
was
what
i
read
he
is
a
man
to
whom
no
adventure
is
too
wild
or
too
daring
his
reckless
bravery
is
a
byword
amongst
many
savage
peoples
and
amongst
many
others
not
savages
whose
fears
are
not
of
material
things
but
of
the
world
of
mysteries
in
and
beyond
the
grave
he
dares
not
only
wild
animals
and
savage
men
but
has
tackled
african
magic
and
indian
mysticism
the
psychical
research
society
has
long
exploited
his
deeds
of
valiance
and
looked
upon
him
as
perhaps
their
most
trusted
agent
or
source
of
discovery
he
is
in
the
very
prime
of
life
of
almost
giant
stature
and
strength
trained
to
the
use
of
all
arms
of
all
countries
inured
to
every
kind
of
hardship
subtleminded
and
resourceful
understanding
human
nature
from
its
elemental
form
up
to
say
that
he
is
fearless
would
be
inadequate
in
a
word
he
is
a
man
whose
strength
and
daring
fit
him
for
any
enterprise
of
any
kind
he
would
dare
and
do
anything
in
the
world
or
out
of
it
on
the
earth
or
under
it
in
the
sea
orin
the
air
fearing
nothing
material
or
unseen
not
man
or
ghost
nor
god
nor
devil
if
you
ever
care
to
think
of
it
i
carried
that
cutting
in
my
pocketbook
from
that
hour
i
read
it
till
now
remember
again
i
say
that
i
never
interfered
in
the
slightest
way
in
any
of
your
adventures
i
wanted
you
to
dree
your
own
weird
as
the
scotch
say
and
i
wanted
to
know
of
itthat
was
all
now
as
i
hold
you
fully
equipped
for
greater
enterprise
i
want
to
set
your
feet
on
the
road
and
to
provide
you
with
the
most
potent
weaponbeyond
personal
qualitiesfor
the
winning
of
great
honoura
gain
my
dear
nephew
which
i
am
right
sure
does
and
will
appeal
to
you
as
it
has
ever
done
to
me
i
have
worked
for
it
for
more
than
fifty
years
but
now
that
the
time
has
come
when
the
torch
is
slipping
from
my
old
hands
i
look
to
you
my
dearest
kinsman
to
lift
it
and
carry
it
on
the
little
nation
of
the
blue
mountains
has
from
the
first
appealed
to
me
it
is
poor
and
proud
and
brave
its
people
are
well
worth
winning
and
i
would
advise
you
to
throw
in
your
lot
with
them
you
may
find
them
hard
to
win
for
when
peoples
like
individuals
are
poor
and
proud
these
qualities
are
apt
to
react
on
each
other
to
an
endless
degree
these
men
are
untamable
and
no
one
can
ever
succeed
with
them
unless
he
is
with
them
in
allinall
and
is
a
leader
recognized
but
if
you
can
win
them
they
are
loyal
to
death
if
you
are
ambitiousand
i
know
you
arethere
may
be
a
field
for
you
in
such
a
country
with
your
qualifications
fortified
by
the
fortune
which
i
am
happy
enough
to
be
able
to
leave
you
you
may
dare
much
and
go
far
should
i
be
alive
when
you
return
from
your
exploration
in
northern
south
america
i
may
have
the
happiness
of
helping
you
to
this
or
any
other
ambition
and
i
shall
deem
it
a
privilege
to
share
it
with
you
but
time
is
going
on
i
am
in
my
seventysecond
year



the
years
of
man
are
threescore
and
teni
suppose
you
understand
i
do



let
me
point
out
this
for
ambitious
projects
the
great
nationalities
are
impossible
to
a
strangerand
in
our
own
we
are
limited
by
loyalty
and
commonsense
it
is
only
in
a
small
nation
that
great
ambitions
can
be
achieved
if
you
share
my
own
views
and
wishes
the
blue
mountains
is
your
ground
i
hoped
at
one
time
that
i
might
yet
become
a
voivodeeven
a
great
one
but
age
has
dulled
my
personal
ambitions
as
it
has
cramped
my
powers
i
no
longer
dream
of
such
honour
for
myself
though
i
do
look
on
it
as
a
possibility
for
you
if
you
care
for
it
through
my
will
you
will
have
a
great
position
and
a
great
estate
and
though
you
may
have
to
yield
up
the
latter
in
accordance
with
my
wish
as
already
expressed
in
this
letter
the
very
doing
so
will
give
you
an
even
greater
hold
than
this
possession
in
the
hearts
of
the
mountaineers
should
they
ever
come
to
know
it
should
it
be
that
at
the
time
you
inherit
from
me
the
voivode
vissarion
should
not
be
alive
it
may
serve
or
aid
you
to
know
that
in
such
case
you
would
be
absolved
from
any
conditions
of
mine
though
i
trust
you
would
in
that
as
in
all
other
matters
hold
obligation
enforced
by
your
own
honour
as
to
my
wishes
therefore
the
matter
stands
thus
if
vissarion
lives
you
will
relinquish
the
estates
should
such
not
be
the
case
you
will
act
as
you
believe
that
i
would
wish
you
to
in
either
case
the
mountaineers
should
not
know
from
you
in
any
way
of
the
secret
contracts
between
vissarion
and
myself
enlightenment
of
the
many
should
if
ever
come
from
others
than
yourself
and
unless
such
take
place
you
would
leave
the
estates
without
any
quid
pro
quo
whatever
this
you
need
not
mind
for
the
fortune
you
will
inherit
will
leave
you
free
and
able
to
purchase
other
estates
in
the
blue
mountains
or
elsewhere
that
you
may
select
in
the
world
if
others
attack
attack
them
and
quicker
and
harder
than
they
can
if
such
be
a
possibility
should
it
ever
be
that
you
inherit
the
castle
of
vissarion
on
the
spear
of
ivan
remember
that
i
had
it
secretly
fortified
and
armed
against
attack
there
are
not
only
massive
grilles
but
doors
of
chilled
bronze
where
such
be
needed
my
adherent
rooke
who
has
faithfully
served
me
for
nearly
forty
years
and
has
gone
on
my
behalf
on
many
perilous
expeditions
will
i
trust
serve
you
in
the
same
way
treat
him
well
for
my
sake
if
not
for
your
own
i
have
left
him
provision
for
a
life
of
ease
but
he
would
rather
take
a
part
in
dangerous
enterprises
he
is
silent
as
the
grave
and
as
bold
as
a
lion
he
knows
every
detail
of
the
fortification
and
of
the
secret
means
of
defence

in
this

but
from
this
fact
you
can
understand

you

my
dearest
aunt
janet
you
will
i
know
be
rejoiced
to
hear
of
the
great
goodfortune
which
has
come
to
me
through
the
will
of
uncle
roger
perhaps
sir
colin
will
have
written
to
you
as
he
is
one
of
the
executors
and
there
is
a
bequest
to
you
so
i
must
not
spoil
his
pleasure
of
telling
you
of
that
part
himself
unfortunately
i
am
not
free
to
speak
fully
of
my
own
legacy
yet
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
at
worst
i
am
to
receive
an
amount
many
times
more
than
i
ever
dreamt
of
possessing
through
any
possible
stroke
of
fortune
so
soon
as
i
can
leave
londonwhere
of
course
i
must
remain
until
things
are
settledi
am
coming
up
to
croom
to
see
you
and
i
hope
i
shall
by
then
be
able
to
let
you
know
so
much
that
you
will
be
able
to
guess
at
the
extraordinary
change
that
has
come
to
my
circumstances
it
is
all
like
an
impossible
dream
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
the
arabian
nights
however
the
details
must
wait
i
am
pledged
to
secrecy
for
the
present
and
you
must
be
pledged
too
you
wont
mind
dear
will
you
what
i
want
to
do
at
present
is
merely
to
tell
you
of
my
own
goodfortune
and
that
i
shall
be
going
presently
to
live
for
a
while
at
vissarion
wont
you
come
with
me
aunt
janet
we
shall
talk
more
of
this
when
i
come
to
croom
but
i
want
you
to
keep
the

in
your
mind
your

1907
things
have
been
humming
about
me
so
fast
that
i
have
had
hardly
time
to
think
but
some
of
the
things
have
been
so
important
and
have
so
changed
my
entire
outlook
on
life
that
it
may
be
well
to
keep
some
personal
record
of
them
i
may
some
day
want
to
remember
some
detailperhaps
the
sequence
of
events
or
something
like
thatand
it
may
be
useful
it
ought
to
be
if
there
is
any
justice
in
things
for
it
will
be
an
awful
swot
to
write
it
when
i
have
so
many
things
to
think
of
now
aunt
janet
i
suppose
will
like
to
keep
it
locked
up
for
me
as
she
does
with
all
my
journals
and
papers
that
is
one
good
thing
about
aunt
janet
amongst
many
she
has
no
curiosity
or
else
she
has
some
other
quality
which
keeps
her
from
prying
as
other
women
would
it
would
seem
that
she
has
not
so
much
as
opened
the
cover
of
one
of
my
journals
ever
in
her
life
and
that
she
would
not
without
my
permission
so
this
can
in
time
go
to
her
also
i
dined
last
night
with
mr
trent
by
his
special
desire
the
dinner
was
in
his
own
rooms
dinner
sent
in
from
the
hotel
he
would
not
have
any
waiters
at
all
but
made
them
send
in
the
dinner
all
at
once
and
we
helped
ourselves
as
we
were
quite
alone
we
could
talk
freely
and
we
got
over
a
lot
of
ground
while
we
were
dining
he
began
to
tell
me
about
uncle
roger
i
was
glad
of
that
for
of
course
i
wanted
to
know
all
i
could
of
him
and
the
fact
was
i
had
seen
very
little
of
him
of
course
when
i
was
a
small
kid
he
was
often
in
our
house
for
he
was
very
fond
of
mother
and
she
of
him
but
i
fancy
that
a
small
boy
was
rather
a
nuisance
to
him
and
then
i
was
at
school
and
he
was
away
in
the
east
and
then
poor
mother
died
while
he
was
living
in
the
blue
mountains
and
i
never
saw
him
again
when
i
wrote
to
him
about
aunt
janet
he
answered
me
very
kindly
but
he
was
so
very
just
in
the
matter
that
i
got
afraid
of
him
and
after
that
i
ran
away
and
have
been
roaming
ever
since
so
there
was
never
a
chance
of
our
meeting
but
that
letter
of
his
has
opened
my
eyes
to
think
of
him
following
me
that
way
all
over
the
world
waiting
to
hold
out
a
helping
hand
if
i
should
want
it
i
only
wish
i
had
known
or
even
suspected
the
sort
of
man
he
was
and
how
he
cared
for
me
and
i
would
sometimes
have
come
back
to
see
him
if
i
had
to
come
half
round
the
world
well
all
i
can
do
now
is
to
carry
out
his
wishes
that
will
be
my
expiation
for
my
neglect
he
knew
what
he
wanted
exactly
and
i
suppose
i
shall
come
in
time
to
know
it
all
and
understand
it
too
i
was
thinking
something
like
this
when
mr
trent
began
to
talk
so
that
all
he
said
fitted
exactly
into
my
own
thought
the
two
men
were
evidently
great
friendsi
should
have
gathered
that
anyhow
from
the
willand
the
lettersso
i
was
not
surprised
when
mr
trent
told
me
that
they
had
been
to
school
together
uncle
roger
being
a
senior
when
he
was
a
junior
and
had
then
and
ever
after
shared
each
others
confidence
mr
trent
i
gathered
had
from
the
very
first
been
in
love
with
my
mother
even
when
she
was
a
little
girl
but
he
was
poor
and
shy
and
did
not
like
to
speak
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
so
he
found
that
she
had
by
then
met
my
father
and
could
not
help
seeing
that
they
loved
each
other
so
he
was
silent
he
told
me
he
had
never
said
a
word
about
it
to
anyonenot
even
to
my
uncle
roger
though
he
knew
from
one
thing
and
another
though
he
never
spoke
of
it
that
he
would
like
it
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
dear
old
man
regarded
me
in
a
sort
of
parental
wayi
have
heard
of
such
romantic
attachments
being
transferred
to
the
later
generation
i
was
not
displeased
with
it
on
the
contrary
i
liked
him
better
for
it
i
love
my
mother
so
muchi
always
think
of
her
in
the
presentthat
i
cannot
think
of
her
as
dead
there
is
a
tie
between
anyone
else
who
loved
her
and
myself
i
tried
to
let
mr
trent
see
that
i
liked
him
and
it
pleased
him
so
much
that
i
could
see
his
liking
for
me
growing
greater
before
we
parted
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
give
up
business
he
must
have
understood
how
disappointed
i
wasfor
how
could
i
ever
get
along
at
all
without
himfor
he
said
as
he
laid
a
hand
quite
affectionately
i
thoughton
my
shoulder
i
shall
have
one
client
though
whose
business
i
always
hope
to
keep
and
for
whom
i
shall
be
always
whilst
i
live
glad
to
actif
he
will
have
me
i
did
not
care
to
speak
as
i
took
his
hand
he
squeezed
mine
too
and
said
very
earnestly
i
served
your
uncles
interests
to
the
very
best
of
my
ability
for
nearly
fifty
years
he
had
full
confidence
in
me
and
i
was
proud
of
his
trust
i
can
honestly
say
rupertyou
wont
mind
me
using
that
familiarity
will
youthat
though
the
interests
which
i
guarded
were
so
vast
that
without
abusing
my
trust
i
could
often
have
used
my
knowledge
to
my
personal
advantage
i
never
once
in
little
matters
or
big
abused
that
trustno
not
even
rubbed
the
bloom
off
it
and
now
that
he
has
remembered
me
in
his
will
so
generously
that
i
need
work
no
more
it
will
be
a
very
genuine
pleasure
and
pride
to
me
to
carry
out
as
well
as
i
can
the
wishes
that
i
partly
knew
and
now
realize
more
fully
towards
you
his
nephew
in
the
long
chat
which
we
had
and
which
lasted
till
midnight
he
told
me
many
very
interesting
things
about
uncle
roger
when
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
mentioned
that
the
fortune
uncle
roger
left
must
be
well
over
a
hundred
millions
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
said
out
loudi
did
not
mean
to
ask
a
question
how
on
earth
could
a
man
beginning
with
nothing
realize
such
a
gigantic
fortune
by
all
honest
ways
he
answered
and
his
clever
human
insight
he
knew
one
half
of
the
world
and
so
kept
abreast
of
all
public
and
national
movements
that
he
knew
the
critical
moment
to
advance
money
required
he
was
always
generous
and
always
on
the
side
of
freedom
there
are
nations
at
this
moment
only
now
entering
on
the
consolidation
of
their
liberty
who
owe
all
to
him
who
knew
when
and
how
to
help
no
wonder
that
in
some
lands
they
will
drink
to
his
memory
on
great
occasions
as
they
used
to
drink
his
health
as
you
and
i
shall
do
now
sir
i
said
as
i
filled
my
glass
and
stood
up
we
drank
it
in
bumpers
we
did
not
say
a
word
either
of
us
but
the
old
gentleman
held
out
his
hand
and
i
took
it
and
so
holding
hands
we
drank
in
silence
it
made
me
feel
quite
choky
and
i
could
see
that
he
too
was

1907
i
asked
mr
rupert
sent
leger
to
dine
with
me
at
my
office
alone
as
i
wished
to
have
a
chat
with
him
tomorrow
sir
colin
and
i
will
have
a
formal
meeting
with
him
for
the
settlement
of
affairs
but
i
thought
it
best
to
have
an
informal
talk
with
him
alone
first
as
i
wished
to
tell
him
certain
matters
which
will
make
our
meeting
tomorrow
more
productive
of
utility
as
he
can
now
have
more
full
understanding
of
the
subjects
which
we
have
to
discuss
sir
colin
is
all
that
can
be
in
manhood
and
i
could
wish
no
better
colleague
in
the
executorship
of
this
phenomenal
will
but
he
has
not
had
the
privilege
of
a
lifelong
friendship
with
the
testator
as
i
have
had
and
as
rupert
sent
leger
had
to
learn
intimate
details
regarding
his
uncle
i
could
best
make
my
confidences
alone
tomorrow
we
shall
have
plenty
of
formality
i
was
delighted
with
rupert
he
is
just
what
i
could
have
wished
his
mothers
boy
to
beor
a
son
of
my
own
to
be
had
i
had
the
goodfortune
to
have
been
a
father
but
this
is
not
for
me
i
remember
long
long
ago
reading
a
passage
in
lambs
essays
which
hangs
in
my
mind
the
children
of
alice
call
bartrum
father
some
of
my
old
friends
would
laugh
to
see
me
write
this
but
these
memoranda
are
for
my
eyes
alone
and
no
one
shall
see
them
till
after
my
death
unless
by
my
own
permission
the
boy
takes
some
qualities
after
his
father
he
has
a
daring
that
is
disturbing
to
an
old
dryasdust
lawyer
like
me
but
somehow
i
like
him
more
than
i
ever
liked
anyoneany
manin
my
lifemore
even
than
his
uncle
my
old
friend
roger
melton
and
lord
knows
i
had
much
cause
to
like
him
i
have
more
than
ever
now
it
was
quite
delightful
to
see
the
way
the
young
adventurer
was
touched
by
his
uncles
thought
of
him
he
is
a
truly
gallant
fellow
but
venturesome
exploits
have
not
affected
the
goodness
of
heart
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
think
that
roger
and
colin
came
together
apropos
of
the
boys
thoughtful
generosity
towards
miss
mackelpie
the
old
soldier
will
be
a
good
friend
to
him
or
i
am
much
mistaken
with
an
old
lawyer
like
me
and
an
old
soldier
like
him
and
a
real
old
gentlewoman
like
miss
mackelpie
who
loves
the
very
ground
he
walks
on
to
look
after
him
together
with
all
his
own
fine
qualities
and
his
marvellous
experience
of
the
world
and
the
gigantic
wealth
that
will
surely
be
his
that
young
man

1907
the
formal
meeting
of
sir
colin
and
myself
with
rupert
sent
leger
went
off
quite
satisfactorily
from
what
he
had
said
yesterday
and
again
last
night
i
had
almost
come
to
expect
an
unreserved
acceptance
of
everything
stated
or
implied
in
roger
meltons
will
but
when
we
had
sat
round
the
tablethis
appeared
by
the
way
to
be
a
formality
for
which
we
were
all
prepared
for
we
sat
down
as
if
by
instinctthe
very
first
words
he
said
were
as
i
suppose
i
must
go
through
this
formality
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
i
accept
every
possible
condition
which
was
in
the
mind
of
uncle
roger
and
to
this
end
i
am
prepared
to
sign
seal
and
deliveror
whatever
is
the
ritualwhatever
document
you
sirturning
to
memay
think
necessary
or
advisable
and
of
which
you
both
approve
he
stood
up
and
walked
about
the
room
for
a
few
moments
sir
colin
and
i
sitting
quite
still
silent
he
came
back
to
his
seat
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
nervousnessa
rare
thing
with
him
i
fancysaid
i
hope
you
both
understandof
course
i
know
you
do
i
only
speak
because
this
is
an
occasion
for
formalitythat
i
am
willing
to
accept
and
at
once
i
do
so
believe
me
not
to
get
possession
of
this
vast
fortune
but
because
of
him
who
has
given
it
the
man
who
was
fond
of
me
and
who
trusted
me
and
yet
had
strength
to
keep
his
own
feelings
in
checkwho
followed
me
in
spirit
to
far
lands
and
desperate
adventures
and
who
though
he
might
be
across
the
world
from
me
was
ready
to
put
out
a
hand
to
save
or
help
me
was
no
common
man
and
his
care
of
my
mothers
son
meant
no
common
love
for
my
dear
mother
and
so
she
and
i
together
accept
his
trust
come
of
it
what
may
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
all
night
and
all
the
time
i
could
not
get
out
of
the
idea
that
mother
was
somewhere
near
me
the
only
thought
that
could
debar
me
from
doing
as
i
wished
to
doand
intend
to
dowould
be
that
she
would
not
approve
now
that
i
am
satisfied
she
would
approve
i
accept
whatever
may
result
or
happen
i
shall
go
on
following
the
course
that
he
has
set
for
me
so
help
me
god
sir
colin
stood
up
and
i
must
say
a
more
martial
figure
i
never
saw
he
was
in
full
uniform
for
he
was
going
on
to
the
kings
levee
after
our
business
he
drew
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
and
laid
it
naked
on
the
table
before
rupert
and
said
you
are
going
sir
into
a
strange
and
danger
countryi
have
been
reading
about
it
since
we
metand
you
will
be
largely
alone
amongst
fierce
mountaineers
who
resent
the
very
presence
of
a
stranger
and
to
whom
you
are
and
must
be
one
if
you
should
ever
be
in
any
trouble
and
want
a
man
to
stand
back
to
back
with
you
i
hope
you
will
give
me
the
honour
as
he
said
this
pointed
to
his
sword
rupert
and
i
were
also
standing
nowone
cannot
sit
down
in
the
presence
of
such
an
act
as
that
you
are
i
am
proud
to
say
allied
with
my
family
and
i
only
wish
to
god
it
was
closer
to
myself
rupert
took
him
by
the
hand
and
bent
his
head
before
him
as
answered
the
honour
is
mine
sir
colin
and
no
greater
can
come
to
any
man
than
that
which
you
have
just
done
me
the
best
way
i
can
show
how
i
value
it
will
be
to
call
on
you
if
i
am
ever
in
such
a
tight
place
by
jove
sir
this
is
history
repeating
itself
aunt
janet
used
to
tell
me
when
i
was
a
youngster
how
mackelpie
of
croom
laid
his
sword
before
prince
charlie
i
hope
i
may
tell
her
of
this
it
would
make
her
so
proud
and
happy
dont
imagine
sir
that
i
am
thinking
myself
a
charles

it
is
only
that
aunt
janet
is
so
good
to
me
that
i
might
well
think
i
was

my
dear
niece
is
a
woman
of
great
discretion
and
discernment
and
moreover
i
am
thinking
she
has
in
her
some
of
the
gift
of
second
sight
that
has
been
a
heritage
of
our
blood
and
i
am
one
with
my
niecein
everything
the
whole
thing
was
quite
regal
in
manner
it
seemed
to
take
me
back
to
the
days
of
the
pretender
it
was
not
however
a
time
for
sentiment
but
for
actionwe
had
met
regarding
the
future
not
the
past
so
i
produced
the
short
document
i
had
already
prepared
on
the
strength
of
his
steadfast
declaration
that
he
would
accept
the
terms
of
the
will
and
the
secret
letters
i
had
got
ready
a
formal
acceptance
when
i
had
once
again
formally
asked
mr
sent
legers
wishes
and
he
had
declared
his
wish
to
accept
i
got
in
a
couple
of
my
clerks
as
witnesses
then
having
again
asked
him
in
their
presence
if
it
was
his
wish
to
declare
acceptance
of
the
conditions
the
document
was
signed
and
witnessed
sir
colin
and
i
both
appending
our
signatures
to
the
attestation
and
so
the
first
stage
of
rupert
sent
legers
inheritance
is
completed
the
next
step
will
not
have
to
be
undertaken
on
my
part
until
the
expiration
of
six
months
from

entry
on

at

as
he
announces
his
intention

1907
my
dearest
aunt
janet
as
you
see
i
am
here
at
last
having
got
my
formal
duty
done
as
you
made
me
promisemy
letters
reporting
arrival
to
sir
colin
and
mr
trent
are
lying
sealed
in
front
of
me
ready
to
post
for
nothing
shall
go
before
yoursi
am
free
to
speak
to
you
this
is
a
most
lovely
place
and
i
hope
you
will
like
it
i
am
quite
sure
you
will
we
passed
it
in
the
steamer
coming
from
trieste
to
durazzo
i
knew
the
locality
from
the
chart
and
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
one
of
the
officers
with
whom
i
had
become
quite
friendly
and
who
kindly
showed
me
interesting
places
whenever
we
got
within
sight
of
shore
the
spear
of
ivan
on
which
the
castle
stands
is
a
headland
running
well
out
into
the
sea
it
is
quite
a
peculiar
placea
sort
of
headland
on
a
headland
jutting
out
into
a
deep
wide
bay
so
that
though
it
is
a
promontory
it
is
as
far
away
from
the
traffic
of
coast
life
as
anything
you
can
conceive
the
main
promontory
is
the
end
of
a
range
of
mountains
and
looms
up
vast
towering
over
everything
a
mass
of
sapphire
blue
i
can
well
understand
how
the
country
came
to
be
called
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
for
it
is
all
mountains
and
they
are
all
blue
the
coastline
is
magnificentwhat
is
called
ironboundbeing
all
rocky
sometimes
great
frowning
precipices
sometimes
jutting
spurs
of
rock
again
little
rocky
islets
now
and
again
clad
with
trees
and
verdure
at
other
places
stark
and
bare
elsewhere
are
little
rocky
bays
and
indentationsalways
rock
and
often
with
long
interesting
caves
some
of
the
shores
of
the
bays
are
sandy
or
else
ridges
of
beautiful
pebbles
where
the
waves
make
endless
murmur
but
of
all
the
places
i
have
seenin
this
land
or
any
otherthe
most
absolutely
beautiful
is
vissarion
it
stands
at
the
ultimate
point
of
the
promontoryi
mean
the
little
or
rather
lesser
promontorythat
continues
on
the
spur
of
the
mountain
range
for
the
lesser
promontory
or
extension
of
the
mountain
is
in
reality
vast
the
lowest
bit
of
cliff
along
the
seafront
is
not
less
than
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
high
that
point
of
rock
is
really
very
peculiar
i
think
dame
nature
must
in
the
early
days
of
her
housekeepingor
rather
housebuildinghave
intended
to
give
her
little
child
man
a
rudimentary
lesson
in
selfprotection
it
is
just
a
natural
bastion
such
as
a
titanic
vauban
might
have
designed
in
primeval
times
so
far
as
the
castle
is
concerned
it
is
alone
visible
from
the
sea
any
enemy
approaching
could
see
only
that
frowning
wall
of
black
rock
of
vast
height
and
perpendicular
steepness
even
the
old
fortifications
which
crown
it
are
not
built
but
cut
in
the
solid
rock
a
long
narrow
creek
of
very
deep
water
walled
in
by
high
steep
cliffs
runs
in
behind
the
castle
bending
north
and
west
making
safe
and
secret
anchorage
into
the
creek
falls
over
a
precipice
a
mountainstream
which
never
fails
in
volume
of
water
on
the
western
shore
of
that
creek
is
the
castle
a
huge
pile
of
buildings
of
every
style
of
architecture
from
the
twelfth
century
to
where
such
things
seemed
to
stop
in
this
dear
oldworld
landabout
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
so
it
is
pretty
picturesque
i
can
tell
you
when
we
got
the
first
glimpse
of
the
place
from
the
steamer
the
officer
with
whom
i
was
on
the
bridge
pointed
towards
it
and
said
that
is
where
we
saw
the
dead
woman
floating
in
a
coffin
that
was
rather
interesting
so
i
asked
him
all
about
it
he
took
from
his
pocketbook
a
cutting
from
an
italian
paper
which
he
handed
to
me
as
i
can
read
and
speak
italian
fairly
well
it
was
all
right
but
as
you
my
dear
aunt
janet
are
not
skilled
in
languages
and
as
i
doubt
if
there
is
any
assistance
of
the
kind
to
be
had
at
croom
i
do
not
send
it
but
as
i
have
heard
that
the
item
has
been
produced
in
the
last
number
of
the
journal
of
occultism
you
will
be
easily
able
to
get
it
as
he
handed
me
the
cutting
he
said
i
am
destilia
his
story
was
so
strange
that
i
asked
him
a
good
many
questions
about
it
he
answered
me
quite
frankly
on
every
point
but
always
adhering
stoutly
to
the
main
pointnamely
that
it
was
no
phantom
or
mirage
no
dream
or
imperfect
vision
in
a
fog
we
were
four
in
all
who
saw
it
he
saidthree
from
the
bridge
and
the
englishman
caulfieldfrom
the
bowswhose
account
exactly
agreed
with
what
we
saw
captain
mirolani
and
falamano
and
i
were
all
awake
and
in
good
trim
we
looked
with
our
nightglasses
which
are
more
than
usually
powerful
you
know
we
need
good
glasses
for
the
east
shore
of
the
adriatic
and
for
among
the
islands
to
the
south
there
was
a
full
moon
and
a
brilliant
light
of
course
we
were
a
little
way
off
for
though
the
spear
of
ivan
is
in
deep
water
one
has
to
be
careful
of
currents
for
it
is
in
just
such
places
that
the
dangerous
currents
run
the
agent
of
lloyds
told
me
only
a
few
weeks
ago
that
it
was
only
after
a
prolonged
investigation
of
the
tidal
and
sea
currents
that
the
house
decided
to
except
from
ordinary
sea
risks
losses
due
to
a
too
close
course
by
the
spear
of
ivan
when
i
tried
to
get
a
little
more
definite
account
of
the
coffinboat
and
the
dead
lady
that
is
given
in
the
journal
of
occultism
he
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
signor
it
is
all
he
said
that
englishman
wrote
everything
after
endless
questioning
so
you
see
my
dear
that
our
new
home
is
not
without
superstitious
interests
of
its
own
it
is
rather
a
nice
idea
is
it
not
to
have
a
dead
woman
cruising
round
our
promontory
in
a
coffin
i
doubt
if
even
at
croom
you
can
beat
that
makes
the
place
kind
of
homey
as
an
american
would
say
when
you
come
aunt
janet
you
will
not
feel
lonesome
at
any
rate
and
it
will
save
us
the
trouble
of
importing
some
of
your
highland
ghosts
to
make
you
feel
at
home
in
the
new
land
i
dont
know
but
we
might
ask
the
stiff
to
come
to
tea
with
us
of
course
it
would
be
a
late
tea
somewhere
between
midnight
and
cockcrow
would
be
about
the
etiquette
of
the
thing
i
fancy
but
i
must
tell
you
all
the
realities
of
the
castle
and
around
it
so
i
will
write
again
within
a
day
or
two
and
try
to
let
you
know
enough
to
prepare
you
for
coming
here
till
then
adieu
my
dear
your
loving
rupert
from
rupert
sent
leger

janet
mackelpie
croom
january
25
1907
i
hope
i
did
not
frighten
you
dear
aunt
janet
by
the
yarn
of
the
lady
in
the
coffin
but
i
know
you
are
not
afraid
you
have
told
me
too
many
weird
stories
for
me
to
dread
that
besides
you
have
second
sightlatent
at
all
events
however
there
wont
be
any
more
ghosts
or
about
ghosts
in
this
letter
i
want
to
tell
you
all
about
our
new
home
i
am
so
glad
you
are
coming
out
so
soon
i
am
beginning
to
feel
so
lonesomei
walk
about
sometimes
aimlessly
and
find
my
thoughts
drifting
in
such
an
odd
way
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
might
begin
to
think
i
was
in
love
there
is
no
one
here
to
be
in
love
with
so
make
your
mind
easy
aunt
janet
not
that
you
would
be
unhappy
i
know
dear
if
i
did
fall
in
love
i
suppose
i
must
marry
some
day
it
is
a
duty
now
i
know
when
there
is
such
an
estate
as
uncle
roger
has
left
me
and
i
know
this
i
shall
never
marry
any
woman
unless
i
love
her
and
i
am
right
sure
that
if
i
do
love
her
you
will
love
her
too
aunt
janet
wont
you
dear
it
wouldnt
be
half
a
delight
if
you
didnt
it
wont
if
you
dont
there
now
but
before
i
begin
to
describe
vissarion
i
shall
throw
a
sop
to
you
as
a
chatelaine
that
may
give
you
patience
to
read
the
rest
the
castle
needs
a
lot
of
things
to
make
it
comfortableas
you
would
consider
it
in
fact
it
is
absolutely
destitute
of
everything
of
a
domestic
nature
uncle
roger
had
it
vetted
on
the
defence
side
and
so
far
it
could
stand
a
siege
but
it
couldnt
cook
a
dinner
or
go
through
a
springcleaning
as
you
know
i
am
not
much
up
in
domestic
matters
and
so
i
cannot
give
you
details
but
you
may
take
it
that
it
wants
everything
i
dont
mean
furniture
or
silver
or
even
goldplate
or
works
of
art
for
it
is
full
of
the
most
magnificent
old
things
that
you
can
imagine
i
think
uncle
roger
must
have
been
a
collector
and
gathered
a
lot
of
good
things
in
all
sorts
of
places
stored
them
for
years
and
then
sent
them
here
but
as
to
glass
china
delft
all
sorts
of
crockery
linen
household
appliances
and
machinery
cooking
utensilsexcept
of
the
simplestthere
are
none
i
dont
think
uncle
roger
could
have
lived
here
more
than
on
a
temporary
picnic
so
far
as
i
only
am
concerned
i
am
all
right
a
gridiron
and
a
saucepan
are
all
i
wantand
i
can
use
them
myself
but
dear
aunt
janet
i
dont
want
you
to
pig
it
i
would
like
you
to
have
everything
you
can
imagine
and
all
of
the
very
best
cost
doesnt
count
now
for
us
thanks
to
uncle
roger
and
so
i
want
you
to
order
all
i
know
you
dearbeing
a
womanwont
object
to
shopping
but
it
will
have
to
be
wholesale
this
is
an
enormous
place
and
will
swallow
up
all
you
can
buylike
a
quicksand
do
as
you
like
about
choosing
but
get
all
the
help
you
can
dont
be
afraid
of
getting
too
much
you
cant
or
of
being
idle
when
you
are
here
i
assure
you
that
when
you
come
there
will
be
so
much
to
do
and
so
many
things
to
think
of
that
you
will
want
to
get
away
from
it
all
and
besides
aunt
janet
i
hope
you
wont
be
too
long
indeed
i
dont
wish
to
be
selfish
but
your
boy
is
lonely
and
wants
you
and
when
you
get
here
you
will
be
an
empress
i
dont
altogether
like
doing
so
lest
i
should
offend
a
millionairess
like
you
but
it
may
facilitate
matters
and
the
ways
of
commerce
are
strict
though
devious
so
i
send
you
a
cheque
for
1000
pounds
for
the
little
things
and
a
letter
to
the
bank
to
honour
your
own
cheques
for
any
amount
i
have
got
i
think
by
the
way
i
should
if
i
were
you
take
or
send
out
a
few
servantsnot
too
many
at
first
only
just
enough
to
attend
on
our
two
selves
you
can
arrange
to
send
for
any
more
you
may
want
later
engage
them
and
arrange
for
their
being
paidwhen
they
are
in
our
service
we
must
treat
them
welland
then
they
can
be
at
our
call
as
you
find
that
we
want
them
i
think
you
should
secure
say
fifty
or
a
hundredtis
an
awfu
big
place
aunt
janet
and
in
the
same
way
will
you
secureand
of
course
arrange
for
pay
similarlya
hundred
men
exclusive
of
any
servants
you
think
it
well
to
have
i
should
like
the
general
if
he
can
give
the
time
to
choose
or
pass
them
i
want
clansmen
that
i
can
depend
on
if
need
be
we
are
going
to
live
in
a
country
which
is
at
present
strange
to
us
and
it
is
well
to
look
things
in
the
face
i
know
sir
colin
will
only
have
men
who
are
a
credit
to
scotland
and
to
ross
and
to
croommen
who
will
impress
the
blue
mountaineers
i
know
they
will
take
them
to
their
heartscertainly
if
any
of
them
are
bachelors
the
girls
will
forgive
me
but
if
we
are
to
settle
here
our
followers
will
probably
want
to
settle
also
moreover
the
blue
mountaineers
may
want
followers
also
and
will
want
them
to
settle
too
and
have
successors
now
for
the
description
of
the
place
well
i
simply
cant
just
now
it
is
all
so
wonderful
and
so
beautiful
the
castlei
have
written
so
much
already
about
other
things
that
i
really
must
keep
the
castle
for
another
letter
love
to
sir
colin
if
he
is
at
croom
and
oh
dear
aunt
janet
how
i
wish
that
my
dear
mother
was
coming
out
it
all
seems
so
dark
and
empty
without
her
how
she
would
have
enjoyed
it
how
proud
she
would
have
been
and
my
dear
if
she
could
be
with
us
again
how
grateful
she
would
have
been
to
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
her
boy
as
i
am
believe

my
dear
aunt
janet
please
read
this
as
if
it
was
a
part
of
the
letter
i
wrote
yesterday
the
castle
itself
is
so
vast
that
i
really
cant
describe
it
in
detail
so
i
am
waiting
till
you
come
and
then
you
and
i
will
go
over
it
together
and
learn
all
that
we
can
about
it
we
shall
take
rooke
with
us
and
as
he
is
supposed
to
know
every
part
of
it
from
the
keep
to
the
torturechamber
we
can
spend
a
few
days
over
it
of
course
i
have
been
over
most
of
it
since
i
camethat
is
i
went
at
various
times
to
see
different
portionsthe
battlements
the
bastions
the
old
guardroom
the
hall
the
chapel
the
walls
the
roof
and
i
have
been
through
some
of
the
network
of
rock
passages
uncle
roger
must
have
spent
a
mint
of
money
on
it
so
far
as
i
can
see
and
though
i
am
not
a
soldier
i
have
been
in
so
many
places
fortified
in
different
ways
that
i
am
not
entirely
ignorant
of
the
subject
he
has
restored
it
in
such
an
uptodate
way
that
it
is
practically
impregnable
to
anything
under
big
guns
or
a
siegetrain
he
has
gone
so
far
as
to
have
certain
outworks
and
the
keep
covered
with
armoured
plating
of
what
looks
like
harveyized
steel
you
will
wonder
when
you
see
it
but
as
yet
i
really
know
only
a
few
rooms
and
am
familiar
with
only
onemy
own
room
the
drawingroomnot
the
great
hall
which
is
a
vast
place
the
librarya
magnificent
one
but
in
sad
disorderwe
must
get
a
librarian
some
day
to
put
it
in
trim
and
the
drawingroom
and
boudoir
and
bedroom
suite
which
i
have
selected
for
you
are
all
fine
but
my
own
room
is
what
suits
me
best
though
i
do
not
think
you
would
care
for
it
for
yourself
if
you
do
you
shall
have
it
it
was
uncle
rogers
own
room
when
he
stayed
here
living
in
it
for
a
few
days
served
to
give
me
more
insight
to
his
characteror
rather
to
his
mindthan
i
could
have
otherwise
had
it
is
just
the
kind
of
place
i
like
myself
so
naturally
i
understand
the
other
chap
who
liked
it
too
it
is
a
fine
big
room
not
quite
within
the
castle
but
an
outlying
part
of
it
it
is
not
detached
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
is
a
sort
of
gardenroom
built
on
to
it
there
seems
to
have
been
always
some
sort
of
place
where
it
is
for
the
passages
and
openings
inside
seem
to
accept
or
recognize
it
it
can
be
shut
off
if
necessaryit
would
be
in
case
of
attackby
a
great
slab
of
steel
just
like
the
door
of
a
safe
which
slides
from
inside
the
wall
and
can
be
operated
from
either
inside
or
outsideif
you
know
how
that
is
from
my
room
or
from
within
the
keep
the
mechanism
is
a
secret
and
no
one
but
rooke
and
i
know
it
the
room
opens
out
through
a
great
french
windowthe
french
window
is
modern
i
take
it
and
was
arranged
by
or
for
uncle
roger
i
think
there
must
have
been
always
a
large
opening
there
for
centuries
at
leastwhich
opens
on
a
wide
terrace
or
balcony
of
white
marble
extending
right
and
left
from
this
a
white
marble
stair
lies
straight
in
front
of
the
window
and
leads
down
to
the
garden
the
balcony
and
staircase
are
quite
ancientof
old
italian
work
beautifully
carved
and
of
course
weatherworn
through
centuries
there
is
just
that
little
tinging
of
green
here
and
there
which
makes
all
outdoor
marble
so
charming
it
is
hard
to
believe
at
times
that
it
is
a
part
of
a
fortified
castle
it
is
so
elegant
and
free
and
open
the
first
glance
of
it
would
make
a
burglars
heart
glad
he
would
say
to
himself
here
is
the
sort
of
crib
i
like
when
im
on
the
job
you
can
just
walk
in
and
out
as
you
choose
but
aunt
janet
old
roger
was
cuter
than
any
burglar
he
had
the
place
so
guarded
that
the
burglar
would
have
been
a
baffled
burglar
there
are
two
steel
shields
which
can
slide
out
from
the
wall
and
lock
into
the
other
side
right
across
the
whole
big
window
one
is
a
grille
of
steel
bands
that
open
out
into
diamondshaped
lozenges
nothing
bigger
than
a
kitten
could
get
through
and
yet
you
can
see
the
garden
and
the
mountains
and
the
whole
viewmuch
the
same
as
you
ladies
can
see
through
your
veils
the
other
is
a
great
sheet
of
steel
which
slides
out
in
a
similar
way
in
different
grooves
it
is
not
of
course
so
heavy
and
strong
as
the
safedoor
which
covers
the
little
opening
in
the
main
wall
but
rooke
tells
me
it
is
proof
against
the
heaviest
riflehall
having
told
you
this
i
must
tell
you
too
aunt
janet
lest
you
should
be
made
anxious
by
the
arrierepensee
of
all
these
warlike
measures
of
defence
that
i
always
sleep
at
night
with
one
of
these
iron
screens
across
the
window
of
course
when
i
am
awake
i
leave
it
open
as
yet
i
have
tried
only
but
not
used
the
grille
and
i
dont
think
i
shall
ever
use
anything
else
for
it
is
a
perfect
guard
if
it
should
be
tampered
with
from
outside
it
would
sound
an
alarm
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
the
pressing
of
a
button
would
roll
out
the
solid
steel
screen
in
front
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
been
so
used
to
the
open
that
i
dont
feel
comfortable
shut
in
i
only
close
windows
against
cold
or
rain
the
weather
here
is
delightfulas
yet
at
all
eventsbut
they
tell
me
that
the
rainy
season
will
be
on
us
before
very
long
i
think
you
will
like
my
den
aunty
dear
though
it
will
doubtless
be
a
worry
to
you
to
see
it
so
untidy
but
that
cant
be
helped
i
must
be
untidy
somewhere
and
it
is
best
in
my
own
den
again
i
find
my
letter
so
long
that
i
must
cut
it
off
now
and
go
on
again
tonight
so
this
must
go
as
it
stands
i
shall
not
cause
you
to
wait
to
hear
all
i
can
tell

my
dear
aunt
janet
my
den
looks
out
as
i
told
you
in
my
last
letter
on
the
garden
or
to
speak
more
accurately
on
one
of
the
gardens
for
there
are
acres
of
them
this
is
the
old
one
which
must
be
almost
as
old
as
the
castle
itself
for
it
was
within
the
defences
in
the
old
days
of
bows
the
wall
that
surrounds
the
inner
portion
of
it
has
long
ago
been
levelled
but
sufficient
remains
at
either
end
where
it
joined
the
outer
defences
to
show
the
long
casemates
for
the
bowmen
to
shoot
through
and
the
raised
stone
gallery
where
they
stood
it
is
just
the
same
kind
of
building
as
the
stonework
of
the
sentrys
walk
on
the
roof
and
of
the
great
old
guardroom
under
it
but
whatever
the
garden
may
have
been
and
no
matter
how
it
was
guarded
it
is
a
most
lovely
place
there
are
whole

i
have

it

and
you
shall

we
have
such
a
fine
head
of
water
here
and
the
climate
is
they
tell
me
usually
so
lovely
that
we
can
do
anything
in
the
gardening
way
if
it
should
ever
turn
out
that
the

shall
put

this
garden
in
front
of
my
room
is
the
old
italian
garden
it
must
have
been
done
with
extraordinary
taste
and
care
for
there
is
not
a
bit
of
it
which
is
not
rarely
beautiful
sir
thomas
browne
himself
for
all
his
quincunx
would
have
been
delighted
with
it
and
have
found
material
for
another
garden
of
cyrus
it
is
so
big
that
there
are
endless
episodes
of
garden
beauty
i
think
all
italy
must
have
been
ransacked
in
old
times
for
garden
stonework
of
exceptional
beauty
and
these
treasures
have
been
put
together
by
some
masterhand
even
the
formal
borders
of
the
walks
are
of
old
porous
stone
which
takes
the
weatherstaining
so
beautifully
and
are
carved
in
endless
variety
now
that
the
gardens
have
been
so
long
neglected
or
left
in
abeyance
the
green
staining
has
become
perfect
though
the
stonework
is
itself
intact
it
has
all
the
picturesque
effect
of
the
wear
and
ruin
wrought
by
many
centuries
i
am
having
it
kept
for
you
just
as
it
is
except
that
i
have
had
the
weeds
and
undergrowth
cleared
away
so
that
its
beauties
might
be
visible
but
it
is
not
merely
the
architect
work
of
the
garden
that
is
so
beautiful
nor
is
the
assembling
there
of
the
manifold
wealth
of
floral
beautythere
is
the
beauty
that
nature
creates
by
the
hand
of
her
servant
time
you
see
aunt
janet
how
the
beautiful
garden
inspires
a
dangerhardened
old
tramp
like
me
to
highgrade
sentiments
of
poetic
fancy
not
only
have
limestone
and
sandstone
and
even
marble
grown
green
in
time
but
even
the
shrubs
planted
and
then
neglected
have
developed
new
kinds
of
beauty
of
their
own
in
some
fardistant
time
some
mastergardener
of
the
vissarions
has
tried
to
realize
an
ideathat
of
tiny
plants
that
would
grow
just
a
little
higher
than
the
flowers
so
that
the
effect
of
an
uneven
floral
surface
would
be
achieved
without
any
hiding
of
anything
in
the
garden
seen
from
anywhere
this
is
only
my
reading
of
what
has
been
from
the
effect
of
what
is
in
the
long
period
of
neglect
the
shrubs
have
outlived
the
flowers
nature
has
been
doing
her
own
work
all
the
time
in
enforcing
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
shrubs
have
grown
and
grown
and
have
overtopped
flower
and
weed
according
to
their
inherent
varieties
of
stature
to
the
effect
that
now
you
see
irregularly
scattered
through
the
garden
quite
a
numberfor
it
is
a
big
placeof
vegetable
products
which
from
a
landscape
standpoint
have
something
of
the
general
effect
of
statues
without
the
cramping
feeling
of
detail
whoever
it
was
that
laid
out
that
part
of
the
garden
or
made
the
choice
of
items
must
have
taken
pains
to
get
strange
specimens

the

is
weird

the

i
am
sure
that
you
will
enjoy
it
for
myself
as
you
know
uncanny
things
hold
no
fear
i
suppose
it
is
that
i
have
been
up
against
so
many
different
kinds
of
fears
or
rather
of
things
which
for
most
people
have
terrors
of
their
own
that
i
have
come
to
have
a
contemptnot
an
active
contempt
you
know
but
a
tolerative
contemptfor
the
whole
family
of
them
and
you
too
will
enjoy
yourself
here
famously
i
know
youll
have
to
collect
all
the
stories
of
such
matters
in
our

make
a
new

1907
my
dear
aunt
janet
i
stopped
writing
last
nightdo
you
know
why
because
i
wanted
to
write
more
this
sounds
a
paradox
but
it
is
true
the
fact
is
that
as
i
go
on
telling
you
of
this
delightful
place
i
keep
finding
out
new
beauties
myself
broadly
speaking
it
is
all
beautiful
in
the
long
view
or
the
little
viewas
the
telescope
or
the
microscope
directsit
is
all
the
same
your
eye
can
turn
on
nothing
that
does
not
entrance
you
i
was
yesterday
roaming
about
the
upper
part
of
time
castle
and
came
across
some
delightful
nooks
which
at
once
i
became
fond
of
and
already
like
them
as
if
i
had
known
them
all
my
life
i
felt
at
first
a
sense
of
greediness
when
i
had
appropriated
to
myself
several
rooms
in
different
placesi
who
have
never
in
my
life
had
more
than
one
room
which
i
could
call
my
ownand
that
only
for
a
time
but
when
i
slept
on
it
the
feeling
changed
and
its
aspect
is
now
not
half
bad
it
is
now
under
another
classificationunder
a
much
more
important
labelproprietorship
if
i
were
writing
philosophy
i
should
here
put
in
a
cynical
remark
selfishness
is
an
appanage
of
poverty
it
might
appear
in
the
studbook
as
by
morals
out
of
wants
i
have
now
three
bedrooms
arranged
as
my
own
particular
dens
one
of
the
other
two
was
also
a
choice
of
uncle
rogers
it
is
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
towers
to
the
extreme
east
and
from
it
i
can
catch
the
first
ray
of
light
over
the
mountains
i
slept
in
it
last
night
and
when
i
woke
as
in
my
travelling
i
was
accustomed
to
do
at
dawn
i
saw
from
my
bed
through
an
open
windowa
small
window
for
it
is
in
a
fortress
towerthe
whole
great
expanse
to
the
east
not
far
off
and
springing
from
the
summit
of
a
great
ruin
where
long
ago
a
seed
had
fallen
rose
a
great
silverbirch
and
the
halftransparent
drooping
branches
and
hanging
clusters
of
leaf
broke
the
outline
of
the
grey
hills
beyond
for
the
hills
were
for
a
wonder
grey
instead
of
blue
there
was
a
mackerel
sky
with
the
clouds
dropping
on
the
mountaintops
till
you
could
hardly
say
which
was
which
it
was
a
mackerel
sky
of
a
very
bold
and
extraordinary
kindnot
a
dish
of
mackerel
but
a
world
of
mackerel
the
mountains
are
certainly
most
lovely
in
this
clear
air
they
usually
seem
close
at
hand
it
was
only
this
morning
with
the
faint
glimpse
of
the
dawn
whilst
the
night
clouds
were
still
unpierced
by
the
sunlight
that
i
seemed
to
realize
their
greatness
i
have
seen
the
same
enlightening
effect
of
aerial
perspective
a
few
times
beforein
colorado
in
upper
india
in
thibet
and
in
the
uplands
amongst
the
andes
there
is
certainly
something
in
looking
at
things
from
above
which
tends
to
raise
ones
own
selfesteem
from
the
height
inequalities
simply
disappear
this
i
have
often
felt
on
a
big
scale
when
ballooning
or
better
still
from
an
aeroplane
even
here
from
the
tower
the
outlook
is
somehow
quite
different
from
below
one
realizes
the
place
and
all
around
it
not
in
detail
but
as
a
whole
i
shall
certainly
sleep
up
here
occasionally
when
you
have
come
and
we
have
settled
down
to
our
life
as
it
is
to
be
i
shall
live
in
my
own
room
downstairs
where
i
can
have
the
intimacy
of
the
garden
but
i
shall
appreciate
it
all
the
more
from
now
and
again
losing
the
sense
of
intimacy
for
a
while
and
surveying
it
without
the
sense
of
ones
own
selfimportance
i
hope
you
have
started
on
that
matter
of
the
servants
for
myself
i
dont
care
a
button
whether
or
not
there
are
any
servants
at
all
but
i
know
well
that
you
wont
come
till
you
have
made
your
arrangements
regarding
them
another
thing
aunt
janet
you
must
not
be
killed
with
work
here
and
it
is
all
so
vast



why
cant
you
get
some
sort
of
secretary
who
will
write
your
letters
and
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
for
you
i
know
you
wont
have
a
man
secretary
but
there
are
lots
of
women
now
who
can
write
shorthand
and
typewrite
you
could
doubtless
get
one
in
the
clansomeone
with
a
desire
to
better
herself
i
know
you
would
make
her
happy
here
if
she
is
not
too
young
all
the
better
she
will
have
learned
to
hold
her
tongue
and
mind
her
own
business
and
not
be
too
inquisitive
that
would
be
a
nuisance
when
we
are
finding
our
way
about
in
a
new
country
and
trying
to
reconcile
all
sorts
of
opposites
in
a
whole
new
country
with
new
people
whom
at
first
we
shant
understand
and
who
certainly
wont
understand
us
where
every
man
carries
a

with
as
little

has

1907
i
am
back
in
my
own
room
again
already
it
seems
to
me
that
to
get
here
again
is
like
coming
home
i
have
been
going
about
for
the
last
few
days
amongst
the
mountaineers
and
trying
to
make
their
acquaintance
it
is
a
tough
job
and
i
can
see
that
there
will
be
nothing
but
to
stick
to
it
they
are
in
reality
the
most
primitive
people
i
ever
metthe
most
fixed
to
their
own
ideas
which
belong
to
centuries
back
i
can
understand
now
what
people
were
like
in
englandnot
in
queen
elizabeths
time
for
that
was
civilized
time
but
in
the
time
of
coeurdelion
or
even
earlierand
all
the
time
with
the
most
absolute
mastery
of
weapons
of
precision
every
man
carries
a
rifleand
knows
how
to
use
it
too
i
do
believe
they
would
rather
go
without
their
clothes
than
their
guns
if
they
had
to
choose
between
them
they
also
carry
a
handjar
which
used
to
be
their
national
weapon
it
is
a
sort
of
heavy
straight
cutlass
and
they
are
so
expert
with
it
as
well
as
so
strong
that
it
is
as
facile
in
the
hands
of
a
blue
mountaineer
as
is
a
foil
in
the
hands
of
a
persian
maitre
darmes
they
are
so
proud
and
reserved
that
they
make
one
feel
quite
small
and
an
outsider
as
well
i
can
see
quite
well
that
they
rather
resent
my
being
here
at
all
it
is
not
personal
for
when
alone
with
me
they
are
genial
almost
brotherly
but
the
moment
a
few
of
them
get
together
they
are
like
a
sort
of
jury
with
me
as
the
criminal
before
them
it
is
an
odd
situation
and
quite
new
to
me
i
am
pretty
well
accustomed
to
all
sorts
of
people
from
cannibals
to
mahatmas
but
im
blessed
if
i
ever
struck
such
a
type
as
thisso
proud
so
haughty
so
reserved
so
distant
so
absolutely
fearless
so
honourable
so
hospitable

you

cant
help
feeling
that
they
are
very
much
like

more
so
im
sure
of
one
thing
that
in
the
end
we
shall
get
on
capitally
together
but
it
will
be
a
slow
job
and
will
need
a
lot
of
patience
i
have
a
feeling
in
my
bones
that
when
they
know
me
better
they
will
be
very
loyal
and
very
true
and
i
am
not
a
hairsbreadth
afraid
of
them
or
anything
they
shall
or
might
do
that
is
of
course
if
i
live
long
enough
for
them
to
have
time
to
know
me
anything
may
happen
with
such
an
indomitable
proud
people
to
whom
pride
is
more
than
victuals
after
all
it
only
needs
one
man
out
of
a
crowd
to
have
a
wrong
idea
or
to
make
a
mistake
as
to
ones
motiveand
there
you
are
but
it
will
be
all
right
that
way
i
am
sure
i
am
come
here
to
stay
as
uncle
roger
wished
and
stay
i
shall
even
if
it
has
to
be
in
a
little
bed
of
my
own
beyond
the
gardenseven

back



i
have
been
reading
over
this
letter
dear
aunt
janet
and
i
am
afraid
the
record
is
rather
an
alarming
one
but
dont
you
go
building
up
superstitious
horrors
or
fears
on
it
honestly
i
am
only
joking
about
deatha
thing
to
which
i
have
been
rather
prone
for
a
good
many
years
back
not
in
very
good
taste
i
suppose
but
certainly
very
useful
when
the
old
man
with
the
black
wings
goes
flying
about
you
day
and
night
in
strange
places
sometimes
visible
and
at
others
invisible
but
you
can
always
hear
wings
especially
in
the
dark
when
you
cannot
see
them
you
know
that
aunt
janet
who
come
of
a
race
of
warriors
and
who
have
special
sight
behind
or
through
the
black
curtain
honestly
i
am
in
no
whit
afraid
of
the
blue
mountaineers
nor
have
i
a
doubt
of
them
i
love
them
already
for
their
splendid
qualities
and
i
am
prepared
to
love
them
for
themselves
i
feel
too
that
they
will
love
me
and
incidentally
they
are
sure
to
love
you
i
have
a
sort
of
undercurrent
of
thought
that
there
is
something
in
their
minds
concerning
mesomething
not
painful
but
disturbing
something
that
has
a
base
in
the
past
something
that
has
hope
in
it
and
possible
pride
and
not
a
little
respect
as
yet
they
can
have
had
no
opportunity
of
forming
such
impression
from
seeing
me
or
from
any
thing
i
have
done
of
course
it
may
be
that
although
they
are
fine
tall
stalwart
men
i
am
still
a
head
and
shoulders
over
the
tallest
of
them
that
i
have
yet
seen
i
catch
their
eyes
looking
up
at
me
as
though
they
were
measuring
me
even
when
they
are
keeping
away
from
me
or
rather
keeping
me
from
them
at
arms
length
i
suppose
i
shall
understand
what
it
all
means
some
day
in
the
meantime
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
on
my
own
waywhich
is
uncle
rogersand
wait
and
be
patient
and
just
i
have
learned
the
value
of
that
any
way
in
my
life
amongst
strange
peoples
goodnight

croom
february
24
1907
my
dear
aunt
janet
i
am
more
than
rejoiced
to
hear
that
you
are
coming
here
so
soon
this
isolation
is
i
think
getting
on
my
nerves
i
thought
for
a
while
last
night
that
i
was
getting
on
but
the
reaction
came
all
too
soon
i
was
in
my
room
in
the
east
turret
the
room
on
the
corbeille
and
saw
here
and
there
men
passing
silently
and
swiftly
between
the
trees
as
though
in
secret
byandby
i
located
their
meetingplace
which
was
in
a
hollow
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
just
outside
the
natural
garden
as
the
map
or
plan
of
the
castle
calls
it
i
stalked
that
place
for
all
i
was
worth
and
suddenly
walked
straight
into
the
midst
of
them
there
were
perhaps
two
or
three
hundred
gathered
about
the
very
finest
lot
of
men
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
it
was
in
its
way
quite
an
experience
and
one
not
likely
to
be
repeated
for
as
i
told
you
in
this
country
every
man
carries
a
rifle
and
knows
how
to
use
it
i
do
not
think
i
have
seen
a
single
man
or
married
man
either
without
his
rifle
since
i
came
here
i
wonder
if
they
take
them
with
them
to
bed
well
the
instant
after
i
stood
amongst
them
every
rifle
in
the
place
was
aimed
straight
at
me
dont
be
alarmed
aunt
janet
they
did
not
fire
at
me
if
they
had
i
should
not
be
writing
to
you
now
i
should
be
in
that
little
bit
of
real
estate
or
the
stone
box
and
about
as
full
of
lead
as
i
could
hold
ordinarily
i
take
it
they
would
have
fired
on
the
instant
that
is
the
etiquette
here
but
this
time
theyall
separately
but
all
togethermade
a
new
rule
no
one
said
a
word
or
so
far
as
i
could
see
made
a
movement
here
came
in
my
own
experience
i
had
been
more
than
once
in
a
tight
place
of
something
of
the
same
kind
so
i
simply
behaved
in
the
most
natural
way
i
could
i
felt
consciousit
was
all
in
a
flash
rememberthat
if
i
showed
fear
or
cause
for
fear
or
even
acknowledged
danger
by
so
much
as
even
holding
up
my
hands
i
should
have
drawn
all
the
fire
they
all
remained
stockstill
as
though
they
had
been
turned
into
stone
for
several
seconds
then
a
queer
kind
of
look
flashed
round
them
like
wind
over
cornsomething
like
the
surprise
one
shows
unconsciously
on
waking
in
a
strange
place
a
second
after
they
each
dropped
the
rifle
to
the
hollow
of
his
arm
and
stood
ready
for
anything
it
was
all
as
regular
and
quick
and
simultaneous
as
a
salute
at
st
jamess
palace
happily
i
had
no
arms
of
any
kind
with
me
so
that
there
could
be
no
complication
i
am
rather
a
quick
hand
myself
when
there
is
any
shooting
to
be
done
however
there
was
no
trouble
here
but
the
contrary
the
blue
mountaineersit
sounds
like
a
new
sort
of
bond
street
band
doesnt
ittreated
me
in
quite
a
different
way
than
they
did
when
i
first
met
them
they
were
amazingly
civil
almost
deferential
but
all
time
same
they
were
more
distant
than
ever
and
all
the
time
i
was
there
i
could
get
not
a
whit
closer
to
them
they
seemed
in
a
sort
of
way
to
be
afraid
or
in
awe
of
me
no
doubt
that
will
soon
pass
away
and
when
we
know
one
another
better
we
shall
become
close
friends
they
are
too
fine
fellows
not
to
be
worth
a
little
waiting
for
that
sentence
by
the
way
is
a
pretty
bad
sentence
in
old
days
you
would
have
slippered
me
for
it
your
journey
is
all
arranged
and
i
hope
you
will
be
comfortable
rooke
will
meet
you
at
liverpool
street
and
look
after
everything
i
shant
write
again
but
when
we
meet
at
fiume
i
shall
begin
to
tell
you
all
the
rest
till
then
goodbye
a
good
journey
to
you
and
a
happy
meeting

us

1907
dearest
uncle
i
had
a
very
comfortable
journey
all
across
europe
rupert
wrote
to
me
some
time
ago
to
say
that
when
i
got
to
vissarion
i
should
be
an
empress
and
he
certainly
took
care
that
on
the
way
here
i
should
be
treated
like
one
rooke
who
seems
a
wonderful
old
man
was
in
the
next
compartment
to
that
reserved
for
me
at
harwich
he
had
everything
arranged
perfectly
and
so
right
on
to
fiume
everywhere
there
were
attentive
officials
waiting
i
had
a
carriage
all
to
myself
which
i
joined
at
antwerpa
whole
carriage
with
a
suite
of
rooms
diningroom
drawingroom
bedroom
even
bathroom
there
was
a
cook
with
a
kitchen
of
his
own
on
board
a
real
chef
like
a
french
nobleman
in
disguise
there
were
also
a
waiter
and
a
servantmaid
my
own
maid
maggie
was
quite
awed
at
first
we
were
as
far
as
cologne
before
she
summoned
up
courage
to
order
them
about
whenever
we
stopped
rooke
was
on
the
platform
with
local
officials
and
kept
the
door
of
my
carriage
like
a
sentry
on
duty
at
fiume
when
the
train
slowed
down
i
saw
rupert
waiting
on
the
platform
he
looked
magnificent
towering
over
everybody
there
like
a
giant
he
is
in
perfect
health
and
seemed
glad
to
see
me
he
took
me
off
at
once
on
an
automobile
to
a
quay
where
an
electric
launch
was
waiting
this
took
us
on
board
a
beautiful
big
steamyacht
which
was
waiting
with
full
steam
up
andhow
he
got
there
i
dont
knowrooke
waiting
at
the
gangway
i
had
another
suite
all
to
myself
rupert
and
i
had
dinner
togetheri
think
the
finest
dinner
i
ever
sat
down
to
this
was
very
nice
of
rupert
for
it
was
all
for
me
he
himself
only
ate
a
piece
of
steak
and
drank
a
glass
of
water
i
went
to
bed
early
for
despite
the
luxury
of
the
journey
i
was
very
tired
i
awoke
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
and
came
on
deck
we
were
close
to
the
coast
rupert
was
on
the
bridge
with
the
captain
and
rooke
was
acting
as
pilot
when
rupert
saw
me
he
ran
down
the
ladder
and
took
me
up
on
the
bridge
he
left
me
there
while
he
ran
down
again
and
brought
me
up
a
lovely
fur
cloak
which
i
had
never
seen
he
put
it
on
me
and
kissed
me
he
is
the
tenderesthearted
boy
in
the
world
as
well
as
the
best
and
bravest
he
made
me
take
his
arm
whilst
he
pointed
out
vissarion
towards
which
we
were
steering
it
is
the
most
lovely
place
i
ever
saw
i
wont
stop
to
describe
it
now
for
it
will
be
better
that
you
see
it
for
yourself
and
enjoy
it
all
fresh
as
i
did
the
castle
is
an
immense
place
you
had
better
ship
off
as
soon
as
all
is
ready
here
and
you
can
arrange
it
the
servants
whom
i
engaged
and
i
am
not
sure
that
we
shall
not
want
as
many
more
there
has
hardly
been
a
mop
or
broom
on
the
place
for
centuries
and
i
doubt
if
it
ever
had
a
thorough
good
cleaning
all
over
since
it
was
built
and
do
you
know
uncle
that
it
might
be
well
to
double
that
little
army
of
yours
that
you
are
arranging
for
rupert
indeed
the
boy
told
me
himself
that
he
was
going
to
write
to
you
about
it
i
think
old
lachlan
and
his
wife
sandys
mary
had
better
be
in
charge
of
the
maids
when
they
come
over
a
lot
of
lassies
like
yon
will
be
iller
to
keep
together
than
a
flock
of
sheep
so
it
will
be
wise
to
have
authority
over
them
especially
as
none
of
them
speaks
a
word
of
foreign
tongues
rookeyou
saw
him
at
the
station
at
liverpool
streetwill
if
he
be
available
go
over
to
bring
the
whole
body
here
he
has
offered
to
do
it
if
i
should
wish
and
by
the
way
i
think
it
will
be
well
when
the
time
comes
for
their
departure
if
not
only
the
lassies
but
lachlan
and
sandys
mary
too
will
call
him
mister
rooke
he
is
a
very
important
person
indeed
here
he
is
in
fact
a
sort
of
master
of
the
castle
and
though
he
is
very
selfsuppressing
is
a
man
of
rarely
fine
qualities
also
it
will
be
well
to
keep
authority
when
your
clansmen
come
over
he
will
have
charge
of
them
too
dear
me
i
find
i
have
written
such
a
long
letter
i
must
stop
and
get
to
work
i
shall
write
again
your
very
affectionate
janet
from
the
same
to
the
same
march
3
1907
dearest
uncle
all
goes
well
here
and
as
there
is
no
news
i
only
write
because
you
are
a
dear
and
i
want
to
thank
you
for
all
the
trouble
you
have
taken
for
meand
for
rupert
i
think
we
had
better
wait
awhile
before
bringing
out
the
servants
rooke
is
away
on
some
business
for
rupert
and
will
not
be
back
for
some
time
rupert
thinks
it
may
be
a
couple
of
months
there
is
no
one
else
that
he
could
send
to
take
charge
of
the
party
from
home
and
i
dont
like
the
idea
of
all
those
lassies
coming
out
without
an
escort
even
lachlan
and
sandys
mary
are
ignorant
of
foreign
languages
and
foreign
ways
but
as
soon
as
rooke
returns
we
can
have
them
all
out
i
dare
say
you
will
have
some
of
your
clansmen
ready
by
then
and
i
think
the
poor
girls
who
may
feel
a
bit
strange
in
a
new
country
like
this
where
the
ways
are
so
different
from
ours
will
feel
easier
when
they
know
that
there
are
some
of
their
own
mankind
near
them
perhaps
it
might
be
well
that
those
of
them
who
are
engaged
to
each
otheri
know
there
are
someshould
marry
before
they
come
out
here
it
will
be
more
convenient
in
many
ways
and
will
save
lodgment
and
besides
these
blue
mountaineers
are
very
handsome
men
goodnight

march
9
1907
my
dear
janet
i
have
duly
received
both
your
letters
and
am
delighted
to
find
you
are
so
well
pleased
with
your
new
home
it
must
certainly
be
a
very
lovely
and
unique
place
and
i
am
myself
longing
to
see
it
i
came
up
here
three
days
ago
and
am
as
usual
feeling
all
the
better
for
a
breath
of
my
native
air
time
goes
on
my
dear
and
i
am
beginning
to
feel
not
so
young
as
i
was
tell
rupert
that
the
men
are
all
fit
and
longing
to
get
out
to
him
they
are
certainly
a
fine
lot
of
men
i
dont
think
i
ever
saw
a
finer
i
have
had
them
drilled
and
trained
as
soldiers
and
in
addition
have
had
them
taught
a
lot
of
trades
just
as
they
selected
themselves
so
he
shall
have
nigh
him
men
who
can
turn
their
hands
to
anythingnot
of
course
that
they
all
know
every
trade
but
amongst
them
there
is
someone
who
can
do
whatever
may
be
required
there
are
blacksmiths
carpenters
farriers
saddlemakers
gardeners
plumbers
cutlers
gunsmiths
so
as
they
all
are
farmers
by
origin
and
sportsmen
by
practice
they
will
make
a
rare
household
body
of
men
they
are
nearly
all
firstclass
shots
and
i
am
having
them
practise
with
revolvers
they
are
being
taught
fencing
and
broadsword
and
jujitsu
i
have
organized
them
in
military
form
with
their
own
sergeants
and
corporals
this
morning
i
had
an
inspection
and
i
assure
you
my
dear
they
could
give
points
to
the
household
troop
in
matters
of
drill
i
tell
you
i
am
proud
of
my
clansmen
i
think
you
are
quite
wise
about
waiting
to
bring
out
the
lassies
and
wiser
still
about
the
marrying
i
dare
say
there
will
be
more
marrying
when
they
all
get
settled
in
a
foreign
country
i
shall
be
glad
of
it
for
as
rupert
is
going
to
settle
there
it
will
be
good
for
him
to
have
round
him
a
little
colony
of
his
own
people
and
it
will
be
good
for
them
too
for
i
know
he
will
be
good
to
themas
you
will
my
dear
the
hills
are
barren
here
and
life
is
hard
and
each
year
there
is
more
and
more
demand
for
crofts
and
sooner
or
later
our
people
must
thin
out
and
mayhap
our
little
settlement
of
mackelpie
clan
away
beyond
the
frontiers
of
the
empire
may
be
some
service
to
the
nation
and
the
king
but
this
is
a
dream
i
see
that
here
i
am
beginning
to
realise
in
myself
one
part
of
isaiahs
prophecy
your
young
men
shall
see
visions
and
your
old
men
shall
dream
dreams
by
the
way
my
dear
talking
about
dreams
i
am
sending
you
out
some
boxes
of
books
which
were
in
your
rooms
they
are
nearly
all
on
odd
subjects
that
we
understandsecond
sight
ghosts
dreams
that
was
what
brought
the
matter
to
my
mind
just
now
superstitions
vampires
wehrwolves
and
all
such
uncanny
folk
and
things
i
looked
over
some
of
these
books
and
found
your
marks
and
underlining
and
comments
so
i
fancy
you
will
miss
them
in
your
new
home
you
will
i
am
sure
feel
more
at
ease
with
such
old
friends
close
to
you
i
have
taken
the
names
and
sent
the
list
to
london
so
that
when
you
pay
me
a
visit
again
you
will
be
at
home
in
all
ways
if
you
come
to
me
altogether
you
will
be
more
welcome
stillif
possible
but
i
am
sure
that
rupert
who
i
know
loves
you
very
much
will
try
to
make
you
so
happy
that
you
will
not
want
to
leave
him
so
i
will
have
to
come
out
often
to
see
you
both
even
at
the
cost
of
leaving
croom
for
so
long
strange
is
it
not
that
now
when
through
roger
meltons
more
than
kind
remembrance
of
me
i
am
able
to
go
where
i
will
and
do
what
i
will
i
want
more
and
more
to
remain
at
home
by
my
own
ingle
i
dont
think
that
anyone
but
you
or
rupert
could
get
me
away
from
it
i
am
working
very
hard
at
my
little
regiment
as
i
call
it
they
are
simply
fine
and
will
i
am
sure
do
us
credit
the
uniforms
are
all
made
and
well
made
too
there
is
not
a
man
of
them
that
does
not
look
like
an
officer
i
tell
you
janet
that
when
we
turn
out
the
vissarion
guard
we
shall
feel
proud
of
them
i
dare
say
that
a
couple
of
months
will
do
all
that
can
be
done
here
i
shall
come
out
with
them
myself
rupert
writes
me
that
he
thinks
it
will
be
more
comfortable
to
come
out
direct
in
a
ship
of
our
own
so
when
i
go
up
to
london
in
a
few
weeks
time
i
shall
see
about
chartering
a
suitable
vessel
it
will
certainly
save
a
lot
of
trouble
to
us
and
anxiety
to
our
people
would
it
not
be
well
when
i
am
getting
the
ship
if
i
charter
one
big
enough
to
take
out
all
your
lassies
too
it
is
not
as
if
they
were
strangers
after
all
my
dear
soldiers
are
soldiers
and
lassies
are
lassies
but
these
are
all
kinsfolk
as
well
as
clansmen
and
clanswomen
and
i
their
chief
shall
be
there
let
me
know
your
views
and
wishes
in
this
respect
mr
trent
whom
i
saw
before
leaving
london
asked
me
to
convey
to
you
his
most
respectful
remembrancesthese
were
his
very
words
and
here
they
are
trent
is
a
nice
fellow
and
i
like
him
he
has
promised
to
pay
me
a
visit
here
before
the
month
is
up
and
i
look
forward
to
our
both
enjoying
ourselves
goodbye
my
dear
and

1907
i
have
waited
till
nowwell
into
middaybefore
beginning
to
set
down
the
details
of
the
strange
episode
of
last
night
i
have
spoken
with
persons
whom
i
know
to
be
of
normal
type
i
have
breakfasted
as
usual
heartily
and
have
every
reason
to
consider
myself
in
perfect
health
and
sanity
so
that
the
record
following
may
be
regarded
as
not
only
true
in
substance
but
exact
as
to
details
i
have
investigated
and
reported
on
too
many
cases
for
the
psychical
research
society
to
be
ignorant
of
the
necessity
for
absolute
accuracy
in
such
matters
of
even
the
minutest
detail
yesterday
was
tuesday
the
second
day
of
april
1907
i
passed
a
day
of
interest
with
its
fair
amount
of
work
of
varying
kinds
aunt
janet
and
i
lunched
together
had
a
stroll
round
the
gardens
after
teaespecially
examining
the
site
for
the
new
japanese
garden
which
we
shall
call
janets
garden
we
went
in
mackintoshes
for
the
rainy
season
is
in
its
full
the
only
sign
of
its
not
being
a
repetition
of
the
deluge
being
that
breaks
in
the
continuance
are
beginning
they
are
short
at
present
but
will
doubtless
enlarge
themselves
as
the
season
comes
towards
an
end
we
dined
together
at
seven
after
dinner
i
had
a
cigar
and
then
joined
aunt
janet
for
an
hour
in
her
drawingroom
i
left
her
at
halfpast
ten
when
i
went
to
my
own
room
and
wrote
some
letters
at
ten
minutes
past
eleven
i
wound
my
watch
so
i
know
the
time
accurately
having
prepared
for
bed
i
drew
back
the
heavy
curtain
in
front
of
my
window
which
opens
on
the
marble
steps
into
the
italian
garden
i
had
put
out
my
light
before
drawing
back
the
curtain
for
i
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
the
scene
before
turning
in
aunt
janet
has
always
had
an
oldfashioned
idea
of
the
need
or
propriety
i
hardly
know
which
of
keeping
windows
closed
and
curtains
drawn
i
am
gradually
getting
her
to
leave
my
room
alone
in
this
respect
but
at
present
the
change
is
in
its
fitful
stage
and
of
course
i
must
not
hurry
matters
or
be
too
persistent
as
it
would
hurt
her
feelings
this
night
was
one
of
those
under
the
old
regime
it
was
a
delight
to
look
out
for
the
scene
was
perfect
of
its
own
kind
the
long
spell
of
rainthe
ceaseless
downpour
which
had
for
the
time
flooded
everywherehad
passed
and
water
in
abnormal
places
rather
trickled
than
ran
we
were
now
beginning
to
be
in
the
sloppy
rather
than
the
deluged
stage
there
was
plenty
of
light
to
see
by
for
the
moon
had
begun
to
show
out
fitfully
through
the
masses
of
flying
clouds
the
uncertain
light
made
weird
shadows
with
the
shrubs
and
statues
in
the
garden
the
long
straight
walk
which
leads
from
the
marble
steps
is
strewn
with
fine
sand
white
from
the
quartz
strand
in
the
nook
to
the
south
of
the
castle
tall
shrubs
of
white
holly
yew
juniper
cypress
and
variegated
maple
and
spiraea
which
stood
at
intervals
along
the
walk
and
its
branches
appeared
ghostlike
in
the
fitful
moonlight
the
many
vases
and
statues
and
urns
always
like
phantoms
in
a
halflight
were
more
than
ever
weird
last
night
the
moonlight
was
unusually
effective
and
showed
not
only
the
gardens
down
to
the
defending
wall
but
the
deep
gloom
of
the
great
foresttrees
beyond
and
beyond
that
again
to
where
the
mountain
chain
began
the
forest
running
up
their
silvered
slopes
flamelike
in
form
deviated
here
and
there
by
great
crags
and
the
outcropping
rocky
sinews
of
the
vast
mountains
whilst
i
was
looking
at
this
lovely
prospect
i
thought
i
saw
something
white
flit
like
a
modified
white
flash
at
odd
moments
from
one
to
another
of
the
shrubs
or
statuesanything
which
would
afford
cover
from
observation
at
first
i
was
not
sure
whether
i
really
saw
anything
or
did
not
this
was
in
itself
a
little
disturbing
to
me
for
i
have
been
so
long
trained
to
minute
observation
of
facts
surrounding
me
on
which
often
depend
not
only
my
own
life
but
the
lives
of
others
that
i
have
become
accustomed
to
trust
my
eyes
and
anything
creating
the
faintest
doubt
in
this
respect
is
a
cause
of
more
or
less
anxiety
to
me
now
however
that
my
attention
was
called
to
myself
i
looked
more
keenly
and
in
a
very
short
time
was

by
her
books
on

from

of

to
this
end
no
wonder
then
that
fully
awake
and
with
senses
all
on
edge
i
waited
for
some
further
manifestation
from
this
ghostly
visitoras
in
my
mind
i
took
it
to
be
it
must
surely
be
a
ghost
or
spiritual
manifestation
of
some
kind
which
moved
in
this
silent
way
in
order
to
see
and
hear
better
i
softly
moved
back
the
folding
grille
opened
the
french
window
and
stepped
out
barefooted
and
pyjamaclad
as
i
was
on
the
marble
terrace
how
cold
the
wet
marble
was
how
heavy
smelled
the
rainladen
garden
it
was
as
though
the
night
and
the
damp
and
even
the
moonlight
were
drawing
the
aroma
from
all
the
flowers
that
blossomed
the
whole
night
seemed
to
exhale
heavy
halfintoxicating
odours
i
stood
at
the
head
of
the
marble
steps
and
all
immediately
before
me
was
ghostly
in
the
extremethe
white
marble
terrace
and
steps
the
white
walks
of
quartzsand
glistening
under
the
fitful
moonlight
the
shrubs
of
white
or
pale
green
or
yellowall
looking
dim
and
ghostly
in
the
glamorous
light
the
white
statues
and
vases
and
amongst
them
still
flitting
noiselessly
that
mysterious
elusive
figure
which
i
could
not
say
was
based
on
fact
or
imagination
i
held
my
breath
listening
intently
for
every
sound
but
sound
there
was
none
save
those
of
the
night
and
its
denizens
owls
hooted
in
the
forest
bats
taking
advantage
of
the
cessation
of
the
rain
flitted
about
silently
like
shadows
in
the
air
but
there
was
no
more
sign
of
moving
ghost
or
phantom
or
whatever
i
had
seen
might
have
beenif
indeed
there
had
been
anything
except
imagination
so
after
waiting
awhile
i
returned
to
my
room
closed
the
window
drew
the
grille
across
again
and
dragged
the
heavy
curtain
before
the
opening
then
having
extinguished
my
candles
went
to
bed
in
the
dark
in
a
few
minutes
i
must
have
been
asleep
what
was
that
i
almost
heard
the
words
of
my
own
thought
as
i
sat
up
in
bed
wide
awake
to
memory
rather
than
present
hearing
the
disturbing
sound
had
seemed
like
the
faint
tapping
at
the
window
for
some
seconds
i
listened
mechanically
but
intently
with
bated
breath
and
that
quick
beating
of
the
heart
which
in
a
timorous
person
speaks
for
fear
and
for
expectation
in
another
in
the
stillness
the
sound
came
againthis
time
a
very
very
faint
but
unmistakable
tapping
at
the
glass
door
i
jumped
up
drew
back
the
curtain
and
for
a
moment
stood
appalled
there
outside
on
the
balcony
in
the
now
brilliant
moonlight
stood
a
woman
wrapped
in
white
graveclothes
saturated
with
water
which
dripped
on
the
marble
floor
making
a
pool
which
trickled
slowly
down
the
wet
steps
attitude
and
dress
and
circumstance
all
conveyed
the
idea
that
though
she
moved
and
spoke
she
was
not
quick
but
dead
she
was
young
and
very
beautiful
but
pale
like
the
grey
pallor
of
death
through
the
still
white
of
her
face
which
made
her
look
as
cold
as
the
wet
marble
she
stood
on
her
dark
eyes
seemed
to
gleam
with
a
strange
but
enticing
lustre
even
in
the
unsearching
moonlight
which
is
after
all
rather
deceptive
than
illuminative
i
could
not
but
notice
one
rare
quality
of
her
eyes
each
had
some
quality
of
refraction
which
made
it
look
as
though
it
contained
a
star
at
every
movement
she
made
the
stars
exhibited
new
beauties
of
more
rare
and
radiant
force
she
looked
at
me
imploringly
as
the
heavy
curtain
rolled
back
and
in
eloquent
gestures
implored
me
to
admit
her
instinctively
i
obeyed
i
rolled
back
the
steel
grille
and
threw
open
the
french
window
i
noticed
that
she
shivered
and
trembled
as
the
glass
door
fell
open
indeed
she
seemed
so
overcome
with
cold
as
to
seem
almost
unable
to
move
in
the
sense
of
her
helplessness
all
idea
of
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
entirely
disappeared
it
was
not
as
if
my
first
idea
of
death
taken
from
her
cerements
was
negatived
it
was
simply
that
i
did
not
think
of
it
at
all
i
was
content
to
accept
things
as
they
wereshe
was
a
woman
and
in
some
dreadful
trouble
that
was
enough
i
am
thus
particular
about
my
own
emotions
as
i
may
have
to
refer
to
them
again
in
matters
of
comprehension
or
comparison
the
whole
thing
is
so
vastly
strange
and
abnormal
that
the
least
thing
may
afterwards
give
some
guiding
light
or
clue
to
something
otherwise
not
understandable
i
have
always
found
that
in
recondite
matters
first
impressions
are
of
more
real
value
than
later
conclusions
we
humans
place
far
too
little
reliance
on
instinct
as
against
reason
and
yet
instinct
is
the
great
gift
of
nature
to
all
animals
for
their
protection
and
the
fulfilment
of
their
functions
generally
when
i
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
not
thinking
of
my
costume
i
found
that
the
woman
was
benumbed
and
hardly
able
to
move
even
when
i
asked
her
to
enter
and
supplemented
my
words
with
gestures
in
case
she
should
not
understand
my
language
she
stood
stockstill
only
rocking
slightly
to
and
fro
as
though
she
had
just
strength
enough
left
to
balance
herself
on
her
feet
i
was
afraid
from
the
condition
in
which
she
was
that
she
might
drop
down
dead
at
any
moment
so
i
took
her
by
the
hand
to
lead
her
in
but
she
seemed
too
weak
to
even
make
the
attempt
when
i
pulled
her
slightly
forward
thinking
to
help
her
she
tottered
and
would
have
fallen
had
i
not
caught
her
in
my
arms
then
half
lifting
her
i
moved
her
forwards
her
feet
relieved
of
her
weight
now
seemed
able
to
make
the
necessary
effort
and
so
i
almost
carrying
her
we
moved
into
the
room
she
was
at
the
very
end
of
her
strength
i
had
to
lift
her
over
the
sill
in
obedience
to
her
motion
i
closed
the
french
window
and
bolted
it
i
supposed
the
warmth
of
the
roomthough
cool
it
was
warmer
than
the
damp
air
withoutaffected
her
quickly
for
on
the
instant
she
seemed
to
begin
to
recover
herself
in
a
few
seconds
as
though
she
had
reacquired
her
strength
she
herself
pulled
the
heavy
curtain
across
the
window
this
left
us
in
darkness
through
which
i
heard
her
say
in
english
light
get
a
light
i
found
matches
and
at
once
lit
a
candle
as
the
wick
flared
she
moved
over
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
tried
if
the
lock
and
bolt
were
fastened
satisfied
as
to
this
she
moved
towards
me
her
wet
shroud
leaving
a
trail
of
moisture
on
the
green
carpet
by
this
time
the
wax
of
the
candle
had
melted
sufficiently
to
let
me
see
her
clearly
she
was
shaking
and
quivering
as
though
in
an
ague
she
drew
the
wet
shroud
around
her
piteously
instinctively
i
spoke
can
i
do
anything
for
you
she
answered
still
in
english
and
in
a
voice
of
thrilling
almost
piercing
sweetness
which
seemed
somehow
to
go
straight
to
my
heart
and
affected
me
strangely
give
me
warmth
i
hurried
to
the
fireplace
it
was
empty
there
was
no
fire
laid
i
turned
to
her
and
said
wait
just
a
few
minutes
here
i
shall
call
someone
and
get
helpand
fire
her
voice
seemed
to
ring
with
intensity
as
she
answered
without
a
pause
no
no
rather
would
i
behere
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
but
as
she
caught
sight
of
her
cerements
went
on
hurriedlyas
i
am
i
trust
younot
others
and
you
must
not
betray
my
trust
almost
instantly
she
fell
into
a
frightful
fit
of
shivering
drawing
again
her
deathclothes
close
to
her
so
piteously
that
it
wrung
my
heart
i
suppose
i
am
a
practical
man
at
any
rate
i
am
accustomed
to
action
i
took
from
its
place
beside
my
bed
a
thick
jaeger
dressinggown
of
dark
brownit
was
of
course
of
extra
lengthand
held
it
out
to
her
as
i
said
put
that
on
it
is
the
only
warm
thing
here
which
would
be
suitable
stay
you
must
remove
that
wetweti
stumbled
about
for
a
word
that
would
not
be
offensivethat
frockdresscostumewhatever
it
is
i
pointed
to
where
in
the
corner
of
the
room
stood
a
chintzcovered
foldingscreen
which
fences
in
my
cold
sponge
bath
which
is
laid
ready
for
me
overnight
as
i
am
an
early
riser
she
bowed
gravely
and
taking
the
dressinggown
in
a
long
white
finelyshaped
hand
bore
it
behind
the
screen
there
was
a
slight
rustle
and
then
a
hollow
flop
as
the
wet
garment
fell
on
the
floor
more
rustling
and
rubbing
and
a
minute
later
she
emerged
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
the
long
jaeger
garment
which
trailed
on
the
floor
behind
her
though
she
was
a
tall
woman
she
was
still
shivering
painfully
however
i
took
a
flask
of
brandy
and
a
glass
from
a
cupboard
and
offered
her
some
but
with
a
motion
of
her
hand
she
refused
it
though
she
moaned
grievously
oh
i
am
so
coldso
cold
her
teeth
were
chattering
i
was
pained
at
her
sad
condition
and
said
despairingly
for
i
was
at
my
wits
end
to
know
what
to
do
tell
me
anything
that
i
can
do
to
help
you
and
i
will
do
it
i
may
not
call
help
there
is
no
firenothing
to
make
it
with
you
will
not
take
some
brandy
what
on
earth
can
i
do
to
give
you
warmth
her
answer
certainly
surprised
me
when
it
came
though
it
was
practical
enoughso
practical
that
i
should
not
have
dared
to
say
it
she
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
for
a
few
seconds
before
speaking
then
with
an
air
of
girlish
innocence
which
disarmed
suspicion
and
convinced
me
at
once
of
her
simple
faith
she
said
in
a
voice
that
at
once
thrilled
me
and
evoked
all
my
pity
let
me
rest
for
a
while
and
cover
me
up
with
rugs
that
may
give
me
warmth
i
am
dying
of
cold
and
i
have
a
deadly
fear
upon
mea
deadly
fear
sit
by
me
and
let
me
hold
your
hand
you
are
big
and
strong
and
you
look
brave
it
will
reassure
me
i
am
not
myself
a
coward
but
tonight
fear
has
got
me
by
the
throat
i
can
hardly
breathe
do
let
me
stay
till
i
am
warm
if
you
only
knew
what
i
have
gone
through
and
have
to
go
through
still
i
am
sure
you
would
pity
me
and
help
me
to
say
that
i
was
astonished
would
be
a
mild
description
of
my
feelings
i
was
not
shocked
the
life
which
i
have
led
was
not
one
which
makes
for
prudery
to
travel
in
strange
places
amongst
strange
peoples
with
strange
views
of
their
own
is
to
have
odd
experiences
and
peculiar
adventures
now
and
again
a
man
without
human
passions
is
not
the
type
necessary
for
an
adventurous
life
such
as
i
myself
have
had
but
even
a

he
has
and

herself

unhappy
condition

the
eyewould
all
demand
respect
even
if
one
did
not
hasten
to
yield
it
nevertheless
i
thought
it
necessary
to
enter
a
protest
against
her
embarrassing
suggestion
i
certainly
did
feel
a
fool
when
making
it
also
a
cad
i
can
truly
say
it
was
made
only
for
her
good
and
out
of
the
best
of
me
such
as
i
am
i
felt
impossibly
awkward
and
stuttered
and
stumbled
before
i
spoke
but
surelythe

mrs
grundyconventionthe
she
interrupted
me
with
an
incomparable
dignitya
dignity
which
had
the
effect
of
shutting
me
up
like
a
claspknife
and
making
me
feel
a
decided
inferiorand
a
poor
show
at
that
there
was
such
a
gracious
simplicity
and
honesty
in
it
too
such
selfrespecting
knowledge
of
herself
and
her
position
that
i
could
be
neither
angry
nor
hurt
i
could
only
feel
ashamed
of
myself
and
of
my
own
littleness
of
mind
and
morals
she
seemed
in
her
icy
coldnessnow
spiritual
as
well
as
bodilylike
an
incarnate
figure
of
pride
as
she
answered
what
are
convenances
or
conventions
to
me
if
you
only
knew
where
i
have
come
fromthe
existence
if
it
can
be
called
so
which
i
have
hadthe
lonelinessthe
horror
and
besides
it
is
for
me
to
make
conventions
not
to
yield
my
personal
freedom
of
action
to
them
even
as
i
ameven
here
and
in
this
garbi

convenances
do
not
trouble
me
or
hamper
me
that
at
least
i
have
won
by
what
i
have
gone
through
even
if
it
had
never
come
to
me
through
any
other
way
let
me
stay
she
said
the
last
words
in
spite
of
all
her
pride
appealingly
but
still
there
was
a
note
of
high
pride
in
all
thisin
all
she
said
and
did
in
her
attitude
and
movement
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
in
the
loftiness
of
her
carriage
and
the
steadfast
look
of
her
open
starlit
eyes
altogether
there
was
something
so
rarely
lofty
in
herself
and
all
that
clad
her
that
face
to
face
with
it
and
with
her
my
feeble
attempt
at
moral
precaution
seemed
puny
ridiculous
and
out
of
place
without
a
word
in
the
doing
i
took
from
an
old
chiffonier
chest
an
armful
of
blankets
several
of
which
i
threw
over
her
as
she
lay
for
in
the
meantime
having
replaced
the
coverlet
she
had
lain
down
at
length
on
the
bed
i
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
beside
her
when
she
stretched
out
her
hand
from
beneath
the
pile
of
wraps
i
took
it
in
mine
saying
get
warm
and
rest
sleep
if
you
can
you
need
not
fear
i
shall
guard
you
with
my
life
she
looked
at
me
gratefully
her
starry
eyes
taking
a
new
light
more
full
of
illumination
than
was
afforded
by
the
wax
candle
which
was
shaded
from
her
by
my
body



she
was
horribly
cold
and
her
teeth
chattered
so
violently
that
i
feared
lest
she
should
have
incurred
some
dangerous
evil
from
her
wetting
and
the
cold
that
followed
it
i
felt
however
so
awkward
that
i
could
find
no
words
to
express
my
fears
moreover
i
hardly
dared
say
anything
at
all
regarding
herself
after
the
haughty
way
in
which
she
had
received
my
wellmeant
protest
manifestly
i
was
but
to
her
as
a
sort
of
refuge
and
provider
of
heat
altogether
impersonal
and
not
to
be
regarded
in
any
degree
as
an
individual
in
these
humiliating
circumstances
what
could
i
do
but
sit
quietand
wait
developments
little
by
little
the
fierce
chattering
of
her
teeth
began
to
abate
as
the
warmth
of
her
surroundings
stole
through
her
i
also
felt
even
in
this
strangely
awakening
position
the
influence
of
the
quiet
and
sleep
began
to
steal
over
me
several
times
i
tried
to
fend
it
off
but
as
i
could
not
make
any
overt
movement
without
alarming
my
strange
and
beautiful
companion
i
had
to
yield
myself
to
drowsiness
i
was
still
in
such
an
overwhelming
stupor
of
surprise
that
i
could
not
even
think
freely
there
was
nothing
for
me
but
to
control
myself
and
wait
before
i
could
well
fix
my
thoughts
i
was
asleep
i
was
recalled
to
consciousness
by
hearing
even
through
the
pall
of
sleep
that
bound
me
the
crowing
of
a
cock
in
some
of
the
outoffices
of
the
castle
at
the
same
instant
the
figure
lying
deathly
still
but
for
the
gentle
heaving
of
her
bosom
began
to
struggle
wildly
the
sound
had
won
through
the
gates
of
her
sleep
also
with
a
swift
gliding
motion
she
slipped
from
the
bed
to
the
floor
saying
in
a
fierce
whisper
as
she
pulled
herself
up
to
her
full
height
let
me
out
i
must
go
i
must
go
by
this
time
i
was
fully
awake
and
the
whole
position
of
things
came
to
me
in
an
instant
which
i
shall
nevercan
neverforget
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
now
nearly
burned
down
to
the
socket
all
the
dimmer
from
the
fact
that
the
first
grey
gleam
of
morning
was
stealing
in
round
the
edges
of
the
heavy
curtain
the
tall
slim
figure
in
the
brown
dressinggown
whose
overlength
trailed
on
the
floor
the
black
hair
showing
glossy
in
the
light
and
increasing
by
contrast
the
marble
whiteness
of
the
face
in
which
the
black
eyes
sent
through
their
stars
fiery
gleams
she
appeared
quite
in
a
frenzy
of
haste
her
eagerness
was
simply
irresistible
i
was
so
stupefied
with
amazement
as
well
as
with
sleep
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
stop
her
but
began
instinctively
to
help
her
by
furthering
her
wishes
as
she
ran
behind
the
screen
and
as
far
as
sound
could
inform
mebegan
frantically
to
disrobe
herself
of
the
warm
dressinggown
and
to
don
again
the
icecold
wet
shroud
i
pulled
back
the
curtain
from
the
window
and
drew
the
bolt
of
the
glass
door
as
i
did
so
she
was
already
behind
me
shivering
as
i
threw
open
the
door
she
glided
out
with
a
swift
silent
movement
but
trembling
in
an
agonized
way
as
she
passed
me
she
murmured
in
a
low
voice
which
was
almost
lost
in
the
chattering
of
her
teeth
oh
thank
youthank
you
a
thousand
times
but
i
must
go
i
must
i
must
i
shall
come
again
and
try
to
show
my
gratitude
do
not
condemn
me
as
ungratefultill
then
and
she
was
gone
i
watched
her
pass
the
length
of
the
white
path
flitting
from
shrub
to
shrub
or
statue
as
she
had
come
in
the
cold
grey
light
of
the
undeveloped
dawn
she
seemed
even
more
ghostly
than
she
had
done
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
night
when
she
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
shadow
of
the
wood
i
stood
on
the
terrace
for
a
long
time
watching
in
case
i
should
be
afforded
another
glimpse
of
her
for
there
was
now
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
she
had
for
me
some
strange
attraction
i
felt
even
then
that
the
look
in
those
glorious
starry
eyes
would
be
with
me
always
so
long
as
i
might
live
there
was
some
fascination
which
went
deeper
than
my
eyes
or
my
flesh
or
my
heartdown
deep
into
the
very
depths
of
my
soul
my
mind
was
all
in
a
whirl
so
that
i
could
hardly
think
coherently
it
all
was
like
a
dream
the
reality
seemed
far
away
it
was
not
possible
to
doubt
that
the
phantom
figure
which
had
been
so
close
to
me
during
the
dark
hours
of
the
night
was
actual
flesh
and
blood
yet
she
was
so
cold
so
cold
altogether
i
could
not
fix
my
mind
to
either
proposition
that
it
was
a
living
woman
who
had
held
my
hand
or
a
dead
body
reanimated
for
the
time
or
the
occasion
in
some
strange
manner
the
difficulty
was
too
great
for
me
to
make
up
my
mind
upon
it
even
had
i
wanted
to
but
in
any
case
i
did
not
want
to
this
would
no
doubt
come
in
time
but
till
then
i
wished
to
dream
on
as
anyone
does
in
a
dream
which
can
still
be
blissful
though
there
be
pauses
of
pain
or
ghastliness
or
doubt
or
terror
so
i
closed
the
window
and
drew
the
curtain
again
feeling
for
the
first
time
the
cold
in
which
i
had
stood
on
the
wet
marble
floor
of
the
terrace
when
my
bare
feet
began
to
get
warm
on
the
soft
carpet
to
get
rid
of
the
chill
feeling
i
got
into
the
bed
on
which
she
had
lain
and
as
the
warmth
restored
me
tried
to
think
coherently
for
a
short
while
i
was
going
over
the
facts
of
the
nightor
what
seemed
as
facts
to
my
remembrance
but
as
i
continued
to
think
the
possibilities
of
any
result
seemed
to
get
less
and
i
found
myself
vainly
trying
to
reconcile
with
the
logic
of
life
the
grim
episode
of
the
night
the
effort
proved
to
be
too
much
for
such
concentration
as
was
left
to
me
moreover
interrupted
sleep
was
clamant
and
would
not
be
denied
what
i
dreamt
ofif
i
dreamt
at
alli
know
not
i
only
know
that
i
was
ready
for
waking
when
the
time
came
it
came
with
a
violent
knocking
at
my
door
i
sprang
from
bed
fully
awake
in
a
second
drew
the
bolt
and
slipped
back
to
bed
with
a
hurried
may
i
come
in
aunt
janet
entered
she
seemed
relieved
when
she
saw
me
and
gave
without
my
asking
an
explanation
of
her
perturbation
oh
laddie
i
hae
been
so
uneasy
aboot
ye
all
the
nicht
i
hae
had
dreams
an
veesions
an
a
sorts
o
uncanny
fancies
i
fear
that
she
was
by
now
drawing
back
the
curtain
and
as
her
eyes
took
in
the
marks
of
wet
all
over
the
floor
the
current
of
her
thoughts
changed
why
laddie
whativer
hae
ye
been
doin
wi
yer
baith
oh
the
mess
ye
hae
made
tis
sinful
to
gie
sic
trouble
an
waste




and
so
she
went
on
i
was
glad
to
hear
the
tirade
which
was
only
what
a
good
housewife
outraged
in
her
sentiments
of
order
would
have
made
i
listened
in
patiencewith
pleasure
when
i
thought
of
what
she
would
have
thought
and
said
had
she
known
the
real
facts
i
was
well
pleased
to
have
got
off
so
easily

1907
for
some
days
after
what
i
call
the
episode
i
was
in
a
strange
condition
of
mind
i
did
not
take
anyonenot
even
aunt
janetinto
confidence
even
she
dear
and
openhearted
and
liberalminded
as
she
is
might
not
have
understood
well
enough
to
be
just
and
tolerant
and
i
did
not
care
to
hear
any
adverse
comment
on
my
strange
visitor
somehow
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
anyone
finding
fault
with
her
or
in
her
though
strangely
enough
i
was
eternally
defending
her
to
myself
for
despite
my
wishes
embarrassing
thoughts
would
come
again
and
again
and
again
in
all
sorts
and
variants
of
queries
difficult
to
answer
i
found
myself
defending
her
sometimes
as
a
woman
hard
pressed
by
spiritual
fear
and
physical
suffering
sometimes
as
not
being
amenable
to
laws
that
govern
the
living
indeed
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
whether
i
looked
on
her
as
a
living
human
being
or
as
one
with
some
strange
existence
in
another
world
and
having
only
a
chance
foothold
in
our
own
in
such
doubt
imagination
began
to
work
and
thoughts
of
evil
of
danger
of
doubt
even
of
fear
began
to
crowd
on
me
with
such
persistence
and
in
such
varied
forms
that
i
found
my
instinct
of
reticence
growing
into
a
settled
purpose
the
value
of
this
instinctive
precaution
was
promptly
shown
by
aunt
janets
state
of
mind
with
consequent
revelation
of
it
she
became
full
of
gloomy
prognostications
and
what
i
thought
were
morbid
fears
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
discovered
that
aunt
janet
had
nerves
i
had
long
had
a
secret
belief
that
she
was
gifted
to
some
degree
at
any
rate
with
second
sight
which
quality
or
whatever
it
is
skilled
in
the
powers
if
not
the
lore
of
superstition
manages
to
keep
at
stretch
not
only
the
mind
of
its
immediate
pathic
but
of
others
relevant
to
it
perhaps
this
natural
quality
had
received
a
fresh
impetus
from
the
arrival
of
some
cases
of
her
books
sent
on
by
sir
colin
she
appeared
to
read
and
reread
these
works
which
were
chiefly
on
occult
subjects
day
and
night
except
when
she
was
imparting
to
me
choice
excerpts
of
the
most
baleful
and
fearsome
kind
indeed
before
a
week
was
over
i
found
myself
to
be
an
expert
in
the
history
of
the
cult
as
well
as
in
its
manifestations
which
latter
i
had
been
versed
in
for
a
good
many
years
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
it
set
me
brooding
such
at
least
i
gathered
was
the
fact
when
aunt
janet
took
me
to
task
for
it
she
always
speaks
out
according
to
her
convictions
so
that
her
thinking
i
brooded
was
to
me
a
proof
that
i
did
and
after
a
personal
examination
i
camereluctantlyto
the
conclusion
that
she
was
right
so
far
at
any
rate
as
my
outer
conduct
was
concerned
the
state
of
mind
i
was
in
however
kept
me
from
making
any
acknowledgment
of
itthe
real
cause
of
my
keeping
so
much
to
myself
and
of
being
so
distrait
and
so
i
went
on
torturing
myself
as
before
with
introspective
questioning
and
she
with
her
mind
set
on
my
actions
and
endeavouring
to
find
a
cause
for
them
continued
and
expounded
her
beliefs
and
fears
her
nightly
chats
with
me
when
we
were
alone
after
dinnerfor
i
had
come
to
avoid
her
questioning
at
other
timeskept
my
imagination
at
high
pressure
despite
myself
i
could
not
but
find
new
cause
for
concern
in
the
perennial
founts
of
her
superstition
i
had
thought
years
ago
that
i
had
then
sounded
the
depths
of
this
branch
of
psychicism
but
this
new
phase
of
thought
founded
on
the
really
deep
hold
which
the
existence
of
my
beautiful
visitor
and
her
sad
and
dreadful
circumstances
had
taken
upon
me
brought
me
a
new
concern
in
the
matter
of
selfimportance
i
came
to
think
that
i
must
reconstruct
my
selfvalues
and
begin
a
fresh
understanding
of
ethical
beliefs
do
what
i
would
my
mind
would
keep
turning
on
the
uncanny
subjects
brought
before
it
i
began
to
apply
them
one
by
one
to
my
own
late
experience
and
unconsciously
to
try
to
fit
them
in
turn
to
the
present
case
the
effect
of
this
brooding
was
that
i
was
despite
my
own
will
struck
by
the
similarity
of
circumstances
bearing
on
my
visitor
and
the
conditions
apportioned
by
tradition
and
superstition
to
such
strange
survivals
from
earlier
ages
as
these
partial
existences
which
are
rather
undead
than
livingstill
walking
the
earth
though
claimed
by
the
world
of
the
dead
amongst
them
are
the
vampire
or
the
wehrwolf
to
this
class
also
might
belong
in
a
measure
the
doppelgangerone
of
whose
dual
existences
commonly
belongs
to
the
actual
world
around
it
so
too
the
denizens
of
the
world
of
astralism
in
any
of
these
named
worlds
there
is
a
material
presencewhich
must
be
created
if
only
for
a
single
or
periodic
purpose
it
matters
not
whether
a
material
presence
already
created
can
be
receptive
of
a
disembodied
soul
or
a
soul
unattached
can
have
a
body
built
up
for
it
or
around
it
or
again
whether
the
body
of
a
dead
person
can
be
made
seeming
quick
through
some
diabolic
influence
manifested
in
the
present
or
an
inheritance
or
result
of
some
baleful
use
of
malefic
power
in
the
past
the
result
is
the
same
in
each
case
though
the
ways
be
widely
different
a
soul
and
a
body
which
are
not
in
unity
but
brought
together
for
strange
purposes
through
stranger
means
and
by
powers
still
more
strange
through
much
thought
and
a
process
of
exclusions
the
eerie
form
which
seemed
to
be
most
in
correspondence
with
my
adventure
and
most
suitable
to
my
fascinating
visitor
appeared
to
be
the
vampire
doppelganger
astral
creations
and
all
suchlike
did
not
comply
with
the
conditions
of
my
night
experience
the
wehrwolf
is
but
a
variant
of
the
vampire
and
so
needed
not
to
be
classed
or
examined
at
all
then
it
was
that
thus
focussed
the
lady
of
the
shroud
for
so
i
came
to
hold
her
in
my
mind
began
to
assume
a
new
force
aunt
janets
library
afforded
me
clues
which
i
followed
with
avidity
in
my
secret
heart
i
hated
the
quest
and
did
not
wish
to
go
on
with
it
but
in
this
i
was
not
my
own
master
do
what
i
wouldbrush
away
doubts
never
so
often
new
doubts
and
imaginings
came
in
their
stead
the
circumstance
almost
repeated
the
parable
of
the
seven
devils
who
took
the
place
of
the
exorcised
one
doubts
i
could
stand
imaginings
i
could
stand
but
doubts
and
imaginings
together
made
a
force
so
fell
that
i
was
driven
to
accept
any
reading
of
the
mystery
which
might
presumably
afford
a
foothold
for
satisfying
thought
and
so
i
came
to
accept
tentatively
the
vampire
theoryaccept
it
at
least
so
far
as
to
examine
it
as
judicially
as
was
given
me
to
do
as
the
days
wore
on
so
the
conviction
grew
the
more
i
read
on
the
subject
the
more
directly
the
evidences
pointed
towards
this
view
the
more
i
thought
the
more
obstinate
became
the
conviction
i
ransacked
aunt
janets
volumes
again
and
again
to
find
anything
to
the
contrary
but
in
vain
again
no
matter
how
obstinate
were
my
convictions
at
any
given
time
unsettlement
came
with
fresh
thinking
over
the
argument
so
that
i
was
kept
in
a
harassing
state
of
uncertainty
briefly
the
evidence
in
favour
of
accord
between
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
vampire
theory
were
her
coming
was
at
nightthe
time
the
vampire
is
according
to
the
theory
free
to
move
at
will
she
wore
her
shrouda
necessity
of
coming
fresh
from
grave
or
tomb
for
there
is
nothing
occult
about
clothing
which
is
not
subject
to
astral
or
other
influences
she
had
to
be
helped
into
my
roomin
strict
accordance
with
what
one
sceptical
critic
of
occultism
has
called
the
vampire
etiquette
she
made
violent
haste
in
getting
away
at
cockcrow
she
seemed
preternaturally
cold
her
sleep
was
almost
abnormal
in
intensity
and
yet
the
sound
of
the
cockcrowing
came
through
it
these
things
showed
her
to
be
subject
to
some
laws
though
not
in
exact
accord
within
those
which
govern
human
beings
under
the
stress
of
such
circumstances
as
she
must
have
gone
through
her
vitality
seemed
more
than
humanthe
quality
of
vitality
which
could
outlive
ordinary
burial
again
such
purpose
as
she
had
shown
in
donning
under
stress
of
some
compelling
direction
her
icecold
wet
shroud
and
wrapt
in
it
going
out
again
into
the
night
was
hardly
normal
for
a
woman
but
if
so
and
if
she
was
indeed
a
vampire
might
not
whatever
it
may
be
that
holds
such
beings
in
thrall
be
by
some
means
or
other
exorcised
to
find
the
means
must
be
my
next
task
i
am
actually
pining
to
see
her
again
never
before
have
i
been
stirred
to
my
depths
by
anyone
come
it
from
heaven
or
hell
from
the
earth
or
the
grave
it
does
not
matter
i
shall
make
it
my
task
to
win
her
back
to
life
and
peace
if
she
be
indeed
a
vampire
the
task
may
be
hard
and
long
if
she
be
not
so
and
if
it
be
merely
that
circumstances
have
so
gathered
round
her
as
to
produce
that
impression
the
task
may
be
simpler
and
the
result
more
sweet
no
not
more
sweet
for
what
can
be
more
sweet
than
to
restore
the
lost
or
seemingly
lost
soul
of
the
woman
you
love
there
the
truth
is
out
at
last
i
suppose
that
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
if
so
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
fight
against
it
i
can
only
wait
with
what
patience
i
can
till
i
see
her
again
but
to
that
end
i
can
do
nothing
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
hernot
even
her
name

the
only
relief
i
have
had
from
the
haunting
anxiety
regarding
the
lady
of
the
shroud
has
been
in
the
troubled
state
of
my
adopted
country
there
has
evidently
been
something
up
which
i
have
not
been
allowed
to
know
the
mountaineers
are
troubled
and
restless
are
wandering
about
singly
and
in
parties
and
holding
meetings
in
strange
places
this
is
what
i
gather
used
to
be
in
old
days
when
intrigues
were
on
foot
with
turks
greeks
austrians
italians
russians
this
concerns
me
vitally
for
my
mind
has
long
been
made
up
to
share
the
fortunes
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
for
good
or
ill
i
mean
to
stay
here
jy
suis
jy
reste
i
share
henceforth
the
lot
of
the
blue
mountaineers
and
not
turkey
nor
greece
nor
austria
nor
italy
nor
russiano
not
france
nor
germany
either
not
man
nor
god
nor
devil
shall
drive
me
from
my
purpose
with
these
patriots
i
throw
in
my
lot
my
only
difficulty
seemed
at
first
to
be
with
the
men
themselves
they
are
so
proud
that
at
the
beginning
i
feared
they
would
not
even
accord
me
the
honour
of
being
one
of
them
however
things
always
move
on
somehow
no
matter
what
difficulties
there
be
at
the
beginning
never
mind
when
one
looks
back
at
an
accomplished
fact
the
beginning
is
not
to
be
seenand
if
it
were
it
would
not
matter
it
is
not
of
any
account
anyhow
i
heard
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
great
meeting
near
here
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
attended
it
i
think
it
was
a
success
if
such
is
any
proof
i
felt
elated
as
well
as
satisfied
when
i
came
away
aunt
janets
second
sight
on
the
subject
was
comforting
though
grim
and
in
a
measure
disconcerting
when
i
was
saying
goodnight
she
asked
me
to
bend
down
my
head
as
i
did
so
she
laid
her
hands
on
it
and
passed
them
all
over
it
i
heard
her
say
to
herself
strange
theres
nothing
there
yet
i
could
have
sworn
i
saw
it
i
asked
her
to
explain
but
she
would
not
for
once
she
was
a
little
obstinate
and
refused
point
blank
to
even
talk
of
the
subject
she
was
not
worried
nor
unhappy
so
i
had
no
cause
for
concern
i
said
nothing
but
i
shall
wait
and
see
most
mysteries
become
plain
or
disappear
altogether
in
time
but
about
the
meetinglest
i
forget
when
i
joined
the
mountaineers
who
had
assembled
i
really
think
they
were
glad
to
see
me
though
some
of
them
seemed
adverse
and
others
did
not
seem
over
well
satisfied
however
absolute
unity
is
very
seldom
to
be
found
indeed
it
is
almost
impossible
and
in
a
free
community
is
not
altogether
to
be
desired
when
it
is
apparent
the
gathering
lacks
that
sense
of
individual
feeling
which
makes
for
the
real
consensus
of
opinionwhich
is
the
real
unity
of
purpose
the
meeting
was
at
first
therefore
a
little
cold
and
distant
but
presently
it
began
to
thaw
and
after
some
fiery
harangues
i
was
asked
to
speak
happily
i
had
begun
to
learn
the
balkan
language
as
soon
as
ever
uncle
rogers
wishes
had
been
made
known
to
me
and
as
i
have
some
facility
of
tongues
and
a
great
deal
of
experience
i
soon
began
to
know
something
of
it
indeed
when
i
had
been
here
a
few
weeks
with
opportunity
of
speaking
daily
with
the
people
themselves
and
learned
to
understand
the
intonations
and
vocal
inflexions
i
felt
quite
easy
in
speaking
it
i
understood
every
word
which
had
up
to
then
been
spoken
at
the
meeting
and
when
i
spoke
myself
i
felt
that
they
understood
that
is
an
experience
which
every
speaker
has
in
a
certain
way
and
up
to
a
certain
point
he
knows
by
some
kind
of
instinct
if
his
hearers
are
with
him
if
they
respond
they
must
certainly
have
understood
last
night
this
was
marked
i
felt
it
every
instant
i
was
talking
and
when
i
came
to
realize
that
the
men
were
in
strict
accord
with
my
general
views
i
took
them
into
confidence
with
regard
to
my
own
personal
purpose
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
mutual
trust
so
for
peroration
i
told
them
that
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
they
wanted
most
for
their
own
protection
and
the
security
and
consolidation
of
their
nation
was
armsarms
of
the
very
latest
pattern
here
they
interrupted
me
with
wild
cheers
which
so
strung
me
up
that
i
went
farther
than
i
intended
and
made
a
daring
venture
ay
i
repeated
the
security
and
consolidation
of
your
countryof
our
country
for
i
have
come
to
live
amongst
you
here
is
my
home
whilst
i
live
i
am
with
you
heart
and
soul
i
shall
live
with
you
fight
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
you
and
if
need
be
shall
die
with
you
here
the
shouting
was
terrific
and
the
younger
men
raised
their
guns
to
fire
a
salute
in
blue
mountain
fashion
but
on
the
instant
the
vladika
1
held
up
his
hands
and
motioned
them
to
desist
in
the
immediate
silence
he
spoke
sharply
at
first
but
later
ascending
to
a
high
pitch
of
singleminded
lofty
eloquence
his
words
rang
in
my
ears
long
after
the
meeting
was
over
and
other
thoughts
had
come
between
them
and
the
present
silence
he
thundered
make
no
echoes
in
the
forest
or
through
the
hills
at
this
dire
time
of
stress
and
threatened
danger
to
our
land
bethink
ye
of
this
meeting
held
here
and
in
secret
in
order
that
no
whisper
of
it
may
be
heard
afar
have
ye
all
brave
men
of
the
blue
mountains
come
hither
through
the
forest
like
shadows
that
some
of
you
thoughtless
may
enlighten
your
enemies
as
to
our
secret
purpose
the
thunder
of
your
guns
would
doubtless
sound
well
in
the
ears
of
those
who
wish
us
ill
and
try
to
work
us
wrong
fellowcountrymen
know
ye
not
that
the
turk
is
awake
once
more
for
our
harming
the
bureau
of
spies
has
risen
from
the
torpor
which
came
on
it
when
the
purpose
against
our
teuta
roused
our
mountains
to
such
anger
that
the
frontiers
blazed
with
passion
and
were
swept
with
fire
and
sword
moreover
there
is
a
traitor
somewhere
in
the
land
or
else
incautious
carelessness
has
served
the
same
base
purpose
something
of
our
needsour
doing
whose
secret
we
have
tried
to
hide
has
gone
out
the
myrmidons
of
the
turk
are
close
on
our
borders
and
it
may
be
that
some
of
them
have
passed
our
guards
and
are
amidst
us
unknown
so
it
behoves
us
doubly
to
be
discreet
believe
me
that
i
share
with
you
my
brothers
our
love
for
the
gallant
englishman
who
has
come
amongst
us
to
share
our
sorrows
and
ambitionsand
i
trust
it
may
be
our
joys
we
are
all
united
in
the
wish
to
do
him
honourthough
not
in
the
way
by
which
danger
might
be
carried
on
the
wings
of
love
my
brothers
our
newest
brother
comes
to
us
from
the
great
nation
which
amongst
the
nations
has
been
our
only
friend
and
which
has
ere
now
helped
us
in
our
direst
needthat
mighty
britain
whose
hand
has
ever
been
raised
in
the
cause
of
freedom
we
of
the
blue
mountains
know
her
best
as
she
stands
with
sword
in
hand
face
to
face
with
our
foes
and
this
her
son
and
now
our
brother
brings
further
to
our
need
the
hand
of
a
giant
and
the
heart
of
a
lion
later
on
when
danger
does
not
ring
us
round
when
silence
is
no
longer
our
outer
guard
we
shall
bid
him
welcome
in
true
fashion
of
our
land
but
till
then
he
will
believefor
he
is
greatheartedthat
our
love
and
thanks
and
welcome
are
not
to
be
measured
by
sound
when
the
time
comes
then
shall
be
sound
in
his
honournot
of
rifles
alone
but
bells
and
cannon
and
the
mighty
voice
of
a
free
people
shouting
as
one
but
now
we
must
be
wise
and
silent
for
the
turk
is
once
again
at
our
gates
alas
the
cause
of
his
former
coming
may
not
be
for
she
whose
beauty
and
nobility
and
whose
place
in
our
nation
and
in
our
hearts
tempted
him
to
fraud
and
violence
is
not
with
us
to
share
even
our
anxiety
here
his
voice
broke
and
there
arose
from
all
a
deep
wailing
sound
which
rose
and
rose
till
the
woods
around
us
seemed
broken
by
a
mighty
and
longsustained
sob
the
orator
saw
that
his
purpose
was
accomplished
and
with
a
short
sentence
finished
his
harangue
but
the
need
of
our
nation
still
remains
then
with
an
eloquent
gesture
to
me
to
proceed
he
merged
in
the
crowd
and
disappeared
how
could
i
even
attempt
to
follow
such
a
speaker
with
any
hope
of
success
i
simply
told
them
what
i
had
already
done
in
the
way
of
help
saying
as
you
needed
arms
i
have
got
them
my
agent
sends
me
word
through
the
code
between
us
that
he
has
procured
for
mefor
usfifty
thousand
of
the
newestpattern
rifles
the
french
ingismalbron
which
has
surpassed
all
others
and
sufficient
ammunition
to
last
for
a
year
of
war
the
first
section
is
in
hand
and
will
soon
be
ready
for
consignment
there
are
other
war
materials
too
which
when
they
arrive
will
enable
every
man
and
womaneven
the
childrenof
our
land
to
take
a
part
in
its
defence
should
such
be
needed
my
brothers
i
am
with
you
in
all
things
for
good
or
ill
it
made
me
very
proud
to
hear
the
mighty
shout
which
arose
i
had
felt
exalted
before
but
now
this
personal
development
almost
unmanned
me
i
was
glad
of
the
longsustained
applause
to
recover
my
selfcontrol
i
was
quite
satisfied
that
the
meeting
did
not
want
to
hear
any
other
speaker
for
they
began
to
melt
away
without
any
formal
notification
having
been
given
i
doubt
if
there
will
be
another
meeting
soon
again
the
weather
has
begun
to
break
and
we
are
in
for
another
spell
of
rain
it
is
disagreeable
of
course
but
it
has
its
own
charm
it
was
during
a
spell
of
wet
weather
that
the
lady
of
the
shroud
came
to
me
perhaps
the
rain
may
bring
her
again
i
hope
so
with
all
my
soul

1907
the
rain
has
continued
for
four
whole
days
and
nights
and
the
lowlying
ground
is
like
a
quagmire
in
places
in
the
sunlight
the
whole
mountains
glisten
with
running
streams
and
falling
water
i
feel
a
strange
kind
of
elation
but
from
no
visible
cause
aunt
janet
rather
queered
it
by
telling
me
as
she
said
goodnight
to
be
very
careful
of
myself
as
she
had
seen
in
a
dream
last
night
a
figure
in
a
shroud
i
fear
she
was
not
pleased
that
i
did
not
take
it
with
all
the
seriousness
that
she
did
i
would
not
wound
her
for
the
world
if
i
could
help
it
but
the
idea
of
a
shroud
gets
too
near
the
bone
to
be
safe
and
i
had
to
fend
her
off
at
all
hazards
so
when
i
doubted
if
the
fates
regarded
the
visionary
shroud
as
of
necessity
appertaining
to
me
she
said
in
a
way
that
was
for
her
almost
sharp
take
care
laddie
tis
ill
jesting
wi
the
powers
o
time
unknown
perhaps
it
was
that
her
talk
put
the
subject
in
my
mind
the
woman
needed
no
such
aid
she
was
always
there
but
when
i
locked
myself
into
my
room
that
night
i
half
expected
to
find
her
in
the
room
i
was
not
sleepy
so
i
took
a
book
of
aunt
janets
and
began
to
read
the
title
was
on
the
powers
and
qualities
of
disembodied
spirits
your
grammar
said
i
to
the
author
is
hardly
attractive
but
i
may
learn
something
which
might
apply
to
her
i
shall
read
your
book
before
settling
down
to
it
however
i
thought
i
would
have
a
look
at
the
garden
since
the
night
of
the
visit
the
garden
seemed
to
have
a
new
attractiveness
for
me
a
night
seldom
passed
without
my
having
a
last
look
at
it
before
turning
in
so
i
drew
the
great
curtain
and
looked
out
the
scene
was
beautiful
but
almost
entirely
desolate
all
was
ghastly
in
the
raw
hard
gleams
of
moonlight
coming
fitfully
through
the
masses
of
flying
cloud
the
wind
was
rising
and
the
air
was
damp
and
cold
i
looked
round
the
room
instinctively
and
noticed
that
the
fire
was
laid
ready
for
lighting
and
that
there
were
smallcut
logs
of
wood
piled
beside
the
hearth
ever
since
that
night
i
have
had
a
fire
laid
ready
i
was
tempted
to
light
it
but
as
i
never
have
a
fire
unless
i
sleep
in
the
open
i
hesitated
to
begin
i
went
back
to
the
window
and
opening
the
catch
stepped
out
on
the
terrace
as
i
looked
down
the
white
walk
and
let
my
eyes
range
over
the
expanse
of
the
garden
where
everything
glistened
as
the
moonlight
caught
the
wet
i
half
expected
to
see
some
white
figure
flitting
amongst
the
shrubs
and
statues
the
whole
scene
of
the
former
visit
came
back
to
me
so
vividly
that
i
could
hardly
believe
that
any
time
had
passed
since
then
it
was
the
same
scene
and
again
late
in
the
evening
life
in
vissarion
was
primitive
and
early
hours
prevailedthough
not
so
late
as
on
that
night
as
i
looked
i
thought
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
white
far
away
it
was
only
a
ray
of
moonlight
coming
through
the
rugged
edge
of
a
cloud
but
all
the
same
it
set
me
in
a
strange
state
of
perturbation
somehow
i
seemed
to
lose
sight
of
my
own
identity
it
was
as
though
i
was
hypnotized
by
the
situation
or
by
memory
or
perhaps
by
some
occult
force
without
thinking
of
what
i
was
doing
or
being
conscious
of
any
reason
for
it
i
crossed
the
room
and
set
light
to
the
fire
then
i
blew
out
the
candle
and
came
to
the
window
again
i
never
thought
it
might
be
a
foolish
thing
to
doto
stand
at
a
window
with
a
light
behind
me
in
this
country
where
every
man
carries
a
gun
with
him
always
i
was
in
my
evening
clothes
too
with
my
breast
well
marked
by
a
white
shirt
i
opened
the
window
and
stepped
out
on
the
terrace
there
i
stood
for
many
minutes
thinking
all
the
time
my
eyes
kept
ranging
over
the
garden
once
i
thought
i
saw
a
white
figure
moving
but
it
was
not
followed
up
so
becoming
conscious
that
it
was
again
beginning
to
rain
i
stepped
back
into
the
room
shut
the
window
and
drew
the
curtain
then
i
realized
the
comforting
appearance
of
the
fire
and
went
over
and
stood
before
it
hark
once
more
there
was
a
gentle
tapping
at
the
window
i
rushed
over
to
it
and
drew
the
curtain
there
out
on
the
rainbeaten
terrace
stood
the
white
shrouded
figure
more
desolateappearing
than
ever
ghastly
pale
she
looked
as
before
but
her
eyes
had
an
eager
look
which
was
new
i
took
it
that
she
was
attracted
by
the
fire
which
was
by
now
well
ablaze
and
was
throwing
up
jets
of
flame
as
the
dry
logs
crackled
the
leaping
flames
threw
fitful
light
across
the
room
and
every
gleam
threw
the
whiteclad
figure
into
prominence
showing
the
gleam
of
the
black
eyes
and
fixing
the
stars
that
lay
in
them
without
a
word
i
threw
open
the
window
and
taking
the
white
hand
extended
to
me
drew
into
the
room
the
lady
of
the
shroud
as
she
entered
and
felt
the
warmth
of
the
blazing
fire
a
glad
look
spread
over
her
face
she
made
a
movement
as
if
to
run
to
it
but
she
drew
back
an
instant
after
looking
round
with
instinctive
caution
she
closed
the
window
and
bolted
it
touched
the
lever
which
spread
the
grille
across
the
opening
and
pulled
close
the
curtain
behind
it
then
she
went
swiftly
to
the
door
and
tried
if
it
was
locked
satisfied
as
to
this
she
came
quickly
over
to
the
fire
and
kneeling
before
it
stretched
out
her
numbed
hands
to
the
blaze
almost
on
the
instant
her
wet
shroud
began
to
steam
i
stood
wondering
the
precautions
of
secrecy
in
the
midst
of
her
sufferingfor
that
she
did
suffer
was
only
too
painfully
manifestmust
have
presupposed
some
danger
then
and
there
my
mind
was
made
up
that
there
should
no
harm
assail
her
that
i
by
any
means
could
fend
off
still
the
present
must
be
attended
to
pneumonia
and
other
ills
stalked
behind
such
a
chill
as
must
infallibly
come
on
her
unless
precautions
were
taken
i
took
again
the
dressinggown
which
she
had
worn
before
and
handed
it
to
her
motioning
as
i
did
so
towards
the
screen
which
had
made
a
dressingroom
for
her
on
the
former
occasion
to
my
surprise
she
hesitated
i
waited
she
waited
too
and
then
laid
down
the
dressinggown
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
fender
so
i
spoke
wont
you
change
as
you
did
before
youryour
frock
can
then
be
dried
do
it
will
be
so
much
safer
for
you
to
be
dry
clad
when
you
resume
your
own
dress
how
can
i
whilst
you
are
here
her
words
made
me
stare
so
different
were
they
from
her
acts
of
the
other
visit
i
simply
bowedspeech
on
such
a
subject
would
be
at
least
inadequateand
walked
over
to
the
window
passing
behind
the
curtain
i
opened
the
window
before
stepping
out
on
to
the
terrace
i
looked
into
the
room
and
said
take
your
own
time
there
is
no
hurry
i
dare
say
you
will
find
there
all
you
may
want
i
shall
remain
on
the
terrace
until
you
summon
me
with
that
i
went
out
on
the
terrace
drawing
close
the
glass
door
behind
me
i
stood
looking
out
on
the
dreary
scene
for
what
seemed
a
very
short
time
my
mind
in
a
whirl
there
came
a
rustle
from
within
and
i
saw
a
dark
brown
figure
steal
round
the
edge
of
the
curtain
a
white
hand
was
raised
and
beckoned
me
to
come
in
i
entered
bolting
the
window
behind
me
she
had
passed
across
the
room
and
was
again
kneeling
before
the
fire
with
her
hands
outstretched
the
shroud
was
laid
in
partially
opened
folds
on
one
side
of
the
hearth
and
was
steaming
heavily
i
brought
over
some
cushions
and
pillows
and
made
a
little
pile
of
them
beside
her
sit
there
i
said
and
rest
quietly
in
the
heat
it
may
have
been
the
effect
of
the
glowing
heat
but
there
was
a
rich
colour
in
her
face
as
she
looked
at
me
with
shining
eyes
without
a
word
but
with
a
courteous
little
bow
she
sat
down
at
once
i
put
a
thick
rug
across
her
shoulders
and
sat
down
myself
on
a
stool
a
couple
of
feet
away
for
fully
five
or
six
minutes
we
sat
in
silence
at
last
turning
her
head
towards
me
she
said
in
a
sweet
low
voice
i
had
intended
coming
earlier
on
purpose
to
thank
you
for
your
very
sweet
and
gracious
courtesy
to
me
but
circumstances
were
such
that
i
could
not
leave
mymyshe
hesitated
before
sayingmy
abode
i
am
not
free
as
you
and
others
are
to
do
what
i
will
my
existence
is
sadly
cold
and
stern
and
full
of
horrors
that
appal
but
i
do
thank
you
for
myself
i
am
not
sorry
for
the
delay
for
every
hour
shows
me
more
clearly
how
good
and
understanding
and
sympathetic
you
have
been
to
me
i
only
hope
that
some
day
you
may
realize
how
kind
you
have
been
and
how
much
i
appreciate
it
i
am
only
too
glad
to
be
of
any
service
i
said
feebly
i
felt
as
i
held
out
my
hand
she
did
not
seem
to
see
it
her
eyes
were
now
on
the
fire
and
a
warm
blush
dyed
forehead
and
cheek
and
neck
the
reproof
was
so
gentle
that
no
one
could
have
been
offended
it
was
evident
that
she
was
something
coy
and
reticent
and
would
not
allow
me
to
come
at
present
more
close
to
her
even
to
the
touching
of
her
hand
but
that
her
heart
was
not
in
the
denial
was
also
evident
in
the
glance
from
her
glorious
dark
starry
eyes
these
glancesveritable
lightning
flashes
coming
through
her
pronounced
reservefinished
entirely
any
wavering
there
might
be
in
my
own
purpose
i
was
aware
now
to
the
full
that
my
heart
was
quite
subjugated
i
knew
that
i
was
in
loveveritably
so
much
in
love
as
to
feel
that
without
this
woman
be
she
what
she
might
by
my
side
my
future
must
be
absolutely
barren
it
was
presently
apparent
that
she
did
not
mean
to
stay
as
long
on
this
occasion
as
on
the
last
when
the
castle
clock
struck
midnight
she
suddenly
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
bound
saying
i
must
go
there
is
midnight
i
rose
at
once
the
intensity
of
her
speech
having
instantly
obliterated
the
sleep
which
under
the
influence
of
rest
and
warmth
was
creeping
upon
me
once
more
she
was
in
a
frenzy
of
haste
so
i
hurried
towards
the
window
but
as
i
looked
back
saw
her
despite
her
haste
still
standing
i
motioned
towards
the
screen
and
slipping
behind
the
curtain
opened
the
window
and
went
out
on
the
terrace
as
i
was
disappearing
behind
the
curtain
i
saw
her
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
lifting
the
shroud
now
dry
from
the
hearth
she
was
out
through
the
window
in
an
incredibly
short
time
now
clothed
once
more
in
that
dreadful
wrapping
as
she
sped
past
me
barefooted
on
the
wet
chilly
marble
which
made
her
shudder
she
whispered
thank
you
again
you
are
good
to
me
you
can
understand
once
again
i
stood
on
the
terrace
saw
her
melt
like
a
shadow
down
the
steps
and
disappear
behind
the
nearest
shrub
thence
she
flitted
away
from
point
to
point
with
exceeding
haste
the
moonlight
had
now
disappeared
behind
heavy
banks
of
cloud
so
there
was
little
light
to
see
by
i
could
just
distinguish
a
pale
gleam
here
and
there
as
she
wended
her
secret
way
for
a
long
time
i
stood
there
alone
thinking
as
i
watched
the
course
she
had
taken
and
wondering
where
might
be
her
ultimate
destination
as
she
had
spoken
of
her
abode
i
knew
there
was
some
definitive
objective
of
her
flight
it
was
no
use
wondering
i
was
so
entirely
ignorant
of
her
surroundings
that
i
had
not
even
a
startingplace
for
speculation
so
i
went
in
leaving
the
window
open
it
seemed
that
this
being
so
made
one
barrier
the
less
between
us
i
gathered
the
cushions
and
rugs
from
before
the
fire
which
was
no
longer
leaping
but
burning
with
a
steady
glow
and
put
them
back
in
their
places
aunt
janet
might
come
in
the
morning
as
she
had
done
before
and
i
did
not
wish
to
set
her
thinking
she
is
much
too
clever
a
person
to
have
treading
on
the
heels
of
a
mysteryespecially
one
in
which
my
own
affections
are
engaged
i
wonder
what
she
would
have
said
had
she
seen
me
kiss
the
cushion
on
which
my
beautiful
guests
head
had
rested
when
i
was
in
bed
and
in
the
dark
save
for
the
fading
glow
of
the
fire
my
thoughts
became
fixed
that
whether
she
came
from
earth
or
heaven
or
hell
my
lovely
visitor
was
already
more
to
me
than
aught
else
in
the
world
this
time
she
had
on
going
said
no
word
of
returning
i
had
been
so
much
taken
up
with
her
presence
and
so
upset
by
her
abrupt
departure
that
i
had
omitted
to
ask
her
and
so
i
am
driven
as
before
to
accept
the
chance
of
her
returninga
chance
which
i
fear
i
am
or
may
be
unable
to
control
surely
enough
aunt
janet
did
come
in
the
morning
early
i
was
still
asleep
when
she
knocked
at
my
door
with
that
purely
physical
subconsciousness
which
comes
with
habit
i
must
have
realized
the
cause
of
the
sound
for
i
woke
fully
conscious
of
the
fact
that
aunt
janet
had
knocked
and
was
waiting
to
come
in
i
jumped
from
bed
and
back
again
when
i
had
unlocked
the
door
when
aunt
janet
came
in
she
noticed
the
cold
of
the
room
save
us
laddie
but
yell
get
your
death
o
cold
in
this
room
then
as
she
looked
round
and
noticed
the
ashes
of
the
extinct
fire
in
the
grate
eh
but
yere
no
that
daft
after
a
yeve
had
the
sense
to
light
yer
fire
glad
i
am
that
we
had
the
fire
laid
and
a
wheen
o
dry
logs
ready
to
yer
hand
she
evidently
felt
the
cold
air
coming
from
the
window
for
she
went
over
and
drew
the
curtain
when
she
saw
the
open
window
she
raised
her
hands
in
a
sort
of
dismay
which
to
me
knowing
how
little
base
for
concern
could
be
within
her
knowledge
was
comic
hurriedly
she
shut
the
window
and
then
coming
close
over
to
my
bed
said
yon
has
been
a
fearsome
nicht
again
laddie
for
yer
poor
auld
aunty
dreaming
again
aunt
janet
i
askedrather
flippantly
as
it
seemed
to
me
she
shook
her
head
not
so
rupert
unless
it
be
that
the
lord
gies
us
in
dreams
what
we
in
our
spiritual
darkness
think
are
veesions
i
roused
up
at
this
when
aunt
janet
calls
me
rupert
as
she
always
used
to
do
in
my
dear
mothers
time
things
are
serious
with
her
as
i
was
back
in
childhood
now
recalled
by
her
word
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
to
cheer
her
would
be
to
bring
her
back
there
tooif
i
could
so
i
patted
the
edge
of
the
bed
as
i
used
to
do
when
i
was
a
wee
kiddie
and
wanted
her
to
comfort
me
and
said
sit
down
aunt
janet
and
tell
me
she
yielded
at
once
and
the
look
of
the
happy
old
days
grew
over
her
face
as
though
there
had
come
a
gleam
of
sunshine
she
sat
down
and
i
put
out
my
hands
as
i
used
to
do
and
took
her
hand
between
them
there
was
a
tear
in
her
eye
as
she
raised
my
hand
and
kissed
it
as
in
old
times
but
for
the
infinite
pathos
of
it
it
would
have
been
comic
aunt
janet
old
and
greyhaired
but
still
retaining
her
girlish
slimness
of
figure
petite
dainty
as
a
dresden
figure
her
face
lined
with
the
care
of
years
but
softened
and
ennobled
by
the
unselfishness
of
those
years
holding
up
my
big
hand
which
would
outweigh
her
whole
arm
sitting
dainty
as
a
pretty
old
fairy
beside
a
recumbent
giantfor
my
bulk
never
seems
so
great
as
when
i
am
near
this
real
little
good
fairy
of
my
lifeseven
feet
beside
four
feet
seven
so
she
began
as
of
old
as
though
she
were
about
to
soothe
a
frightened
child
with
a
fairy
tale
twas
a
veesion
i
think
though
a
dream
it
may
hae
been
but
whichever
or
whatever
it
was
it
concerned
my
little
boy
who
has
grown
to
be
a
big
giant
so
much
that
i
woke
all
of
a
tremble
laddie
dear
i
thought
that
i
saw
ye
being
married
this
gave
me
an
opening
though
a
small
one
for
comforting
her
so
i
took
it
at
once
why
dear
there
isnt
anything
to
alarm
you
in
that
is
there
it
was
only
the
other
day
when
you
spoke
to
me
about
the
need
of
my
getting
married
if
it
was
only
that
you
might
have
children
of
your
boy
playing
around
your
knees
as
their
father
used
to
do
when
he
was
a
helpless
wee
child
himself
that
is
so
laddie
she
answered
gravely
but
your
weddin
was
none
so
merry
as
i
fain
would
see
true
you
seemed
to
loe
her
wi
all
yer
hairt
yer
eyes
shone
that
bright
that
ye
might
ha
set
her
afire
for
all
her
black
locks
and
her
winsome
face
but
laddie
that
was
not
allno
not
though
her
black
een
that
had
the
licht
o
all
the
stars
o
nicht
in
them
shone
in
yours
as
though
a
hairt
o
love
an
passion
too
dwelt
in
them
i
saw
ye
join
hands
an
heard
a
strange
voice
that
talked
stranger
still
but
i
saw
none
ither
your
eyes
an
her
eyes
an
your
hand
an
hers
were
all
i
saw
for
all
else
was
dim
and
the
darkness
was
close
around
ye
twa
and
when
the
benison
was
spokeni
knew
that
by
the
voices
that
sang
and
by
the
gladness
of
her
een
as
well
as
by
the
pride
and
glory
of
yoursthe
licht
began
to
glow
a
wee
more
an
i
could
see
yer
bride
she
was
in
a
veil
o
wondrous
fine
lace
and
there
were
orangeflowers
in
her
hair
though
there
were
twigs
too
and
there
was
a
crown
o
flowers
on
head
wi
a
golden
band
round
it
and
the
heathen
candles
that
stood
on
the
table
wi
the
book
had
some
strange
effect
for
the
reflex
o
it
hung
in
the
air
oer
her
head
like
the
shadow
of
a
crown
there
was
a
gold
ring
on
her
finger
and
a
silver
one
on
yours
here
she
paused
and
trembled
so
that
hoping
to
dispel
her
fears
i
said
as
like
as
i
could
to
the
way
i
used
to
when
i
was
a
child
go
on
aunt
janet
she
did
not
seem
to
recognize
consciously
the
likeness
between
past
and
present
but
the
effect
was
there
for
she
went
on
more
like
her
old
self
though
there
was
a
prophetic
gravity
in
her
voice
more
marked
than
i
had
ever
heard
from
her
all
this
ive
told
ye
was
well
but
oh
laddie
there
was
a
dreadful
lack
o
livin
joy
such
as
i
should
expect
from
the
woman
whom
my
boy
had
chosen
for
his
wifeand
at
the

and
no

all

that

always

i
went

for
i
wanted
to
take
precautions
against
the
possibility
of
her
discovery
of
my
secret
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
she
might
run
my
precious
secret

earth
in
any
wellmeant
piece
of
bungling
that
would
be

1907
after
a
spell
of
loneliness
which
has
seemed
endless
i
have
something
to
write
when
the
void
in
my
heart
was
becoming
the
receptacle
for
many
devils
of
suspicion
and
distrust
i
set
myself
a
task
which
might
i
thought
keep
my
thoughts
in
part
at
any
rate
occupiedto
explore
minutely
the
neighbourhood
round
the
castle
this
might
i
hoped
serve
as
an
anodyne
to
my
pain
of
loneliness
which
grew
more
acute
as
the
days
the
hours
wore
on
even
if
it
should
not
ultimately
afford
me
some
clue
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
woman
whom
i
had
now
grown
to
love
so
madly
my
exploration
soon
took
a
systematic
form
as
i
intended
that
it
should
be
exhaustive
i
would
take
every
day
a
separate
line
of
advance
from
the
castle
beginning
at
the
south
and
working
round
by
the
east
to
the
north
the
first
day
only
took
me
to
the
edge
of
the
creek
which
i
crossed
in
a
boat
and
landed
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
opposite
i
found
the
cliffs
alone
worth
a
visit
here
and
there
were
openings
to
caves
which
i
made
up
my
mind
to
explore
later
i
managed
to
climb
up
the
cliff
at
a
spot
less
beetling
than
the
rest
and
continued
my
journey
it
was
though
very
beautiful
not
a
specially
interesting
place
i
explored
that
spoke
of
the
wheel
of
which
vissarion
was
the
hub
and
got
back
just
in
time
for
dinner
the
next
day
i
took
a
course
slightly
more
to
the
eastward
i
had
no
difficulty
in
keeping
a
straight
path
for
once
i
had
rowed
across
the
creek
the
old
church
of
st
sava
rose
before
me
in
stately
gloom
this
was
the
spot
where
many
generations
of
the
noblest
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
had
from
time
immemorial
been
laid
to
rest
amongst
them
the
vissarions
again
i
found
the
opposite
cliffs
pierced
here
and
there
with
caves
some
with
wide
openingsothers
the
openings
of
which
were
partly
above
and
partly
below
water
i
could
however
find
no
means
of
climbing
the
cliff
at
this
part
and
had
to
make
a
long
detour
following
up
the
line
of
the
creek
till
further
on
i
found
a
piece
of
beach
from
which
ascent
was
possible
here
i
ascended
and
found
that
i
was
on
a
line
between
the
castle
and
the
southern
side
of
the
mountains
i
saw
the
church
of
st
sava
away
to
my
right
and
not
far
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
made
my
way
to
it
at
once
for
as
yet
i
had
never
been
near
it
hitherto
my
excursions
had
been
limited
to
the
castle
and
its
many
gardens
and
surroundings
it
was
of
a
style
with
which
i
was
not
familiarwith
four
wings
to
the
points
of
the
compass
the
great
doorway
set
in
a
magnificent
frontage
of
carved
stone
of
manifestly
ancient
date
faced
west
so
that
when
one
entered
he
went
east
to
my
surprisefor
somehow
i
expected
the
contraryi
found
the
door
open
not
wide
open
but
what
is
called
ajarmanifestly
not
locked
or
barred
but
not
sufficiently
open
for
one
to
look
in
i
entered
and
after
passing
through
a
wide
vestibule
more
like
a
section
of
a
corridor
than
an
ostensible
entrance
made
my
way
through
a
spacious
doorway
into
the
body
of
the
church
the
church
itself
was
almost
circular
the
openings
of
the
four
naves
being
spacious
enough
to
give
the
appearance
of
the
interior
as
a
whole
being
a
huge
cross
it
was
strangely
dim
for
the
window
openings
were
small
and
highset
and
were
moreover
filled
with
green
or
blue
glass
each
window
having
a
colour
to
itself
the
glass
was
very
old
being
of
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
century
such
appointments
as
there
werefor
it
had
a
general
air
of
desolationwere
of
great
beauty
and
richnessespecially
so
to
be
in
a
placeeven
a
churchwhere
the
door
lay
open
and
no
one
was
to
be
seen
it
was
strangely
silent
even
for
an
old
church
on
a
lonesome
headland
there
reigned
a
dismal
solemnity
which
seemed
to
chill
me
accustomed
as
i
have
been
to
strange
and
weird
places
it
seemed
abandoned
though
it
had
not
that
air
of
having
been
neglected
which
is
so
often
to
be
noticed
in
old
churches
there
was
none
of
the
everlasting
accumulation
of
dust
which
prevails
in
places
of
higher
cultivation
and
larger
and
more
strenuous
work
in
the
church
itself
or
its
appending
chambers
i
could
find
no
clue
or
suggestion
which
could
guide
me
in
any
way
in
my
search
for
the
lady
of
the
shroud
monuments
there
were
in
profusionstatues
tablets
and
all
the
customary
memorials
of
the
dead
the
families
and
dates
represented
were
simply
bewildering
often
the
name
of
vissarion
was
given
and
the
inscription
which
it
held
i
read
through
carefully
looking
to
find
some
enlightenment
of
any
kind
but
all
in
vain
there
was
nothing
to
see
in
the
church
itself
so
i
determined
to
visit
the
crypt
i
had
no
lantern
or
candle
with
me
so
had
to
go
back
to
the
castle
to
secure
one
it
was
strange
coming
in
from
the
sunlight
here
overwhelming
to
one
so
recently
accustomed
to
northern
skies
to
note
the
slender
gleam
of
the
lantern
which
i
carried
and
which
i
had
lit
inside
the
door
at
my
first
entry
to
the
church
my
mind
had
been
so
much
taken
up
with
the
strangeness
of
the
place
together
with
the
intensity
of
wish
for
some
sort
of
clue
that
i
had
really
no
opportunity
of
examining
detail
but
now
detail
became
necessary
as
i
had
to
find
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
my
puny
light
could
not
dissipate
the
semicimmerian
gloom
of
the
vast
edifice
i
had
to
throw
the
feeble
gleam
into
one
after
another
of
the
dark
corners
at
last
i
found
behind
the
great
screen
a
narrow
stone
staircase
which
seemed
to
wind
down
into
the
rock
it
was
not
in
any
way
secret
but
being
in
the
narrow
space
behind
the
great
screen
was
not
visible
except
when
close
to
it
i
knew
i
was
now
close
to
my
objective
and
began
to
descend
accustomed
though
i
have
been
to
all
sorts
of
mysteries
and
dangers
i
felt
awed
and
almost
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
desolation
as
i
descended
the
ancient
winding
steps
these
were
many
in
number
roughly
hewn
of
old
in
the
solid
rock
on
which
the
church
was
built
i
met
a
fresh
surprise
in
finding
that
the
door
of
the
crypt
was
open
after
all
this
was
different
from
the
churchdoor
being
open
for
in
many
places
it
is
a
custom
to
allow
all
comers
at
all
times
to
find
rest
and
comfort
in
the
sacred
place
but
i
did
expect
that
at
least
the
final
restingplace
of
the
historic
dead
would
be
held
safe
against
casual
intrusion
even
i
on
a
quest
which
was
very
near
my
heart
paused
with
an
almost
overwhelming
sense
of
decorum
before
passing
through
that
open
door
the
crypt
was
a
huge
place
strangely
lofty
for
a
vault
from
its
formation
however
i
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
originally
a
natural
cavern
altered
to
its
present
purpose
by
the
hand
of
man
i
could
hear
somewhere
near
the
sound
of
running
water
but
i
could
not
locate
it
now
and
again
at
irregular
intervals
there
was
a
prolonged
booming
which
could
only
come
from
a
wave
breaking
in
a
confined
place
the
recollection
then
came
to
me
of
the
proximity
of
the
church
to
the
top
of
the
beetling
cliff
and
of
the
halfsunk
cavern
entrances
which
pierced
it
with
the
gleam
of
my
lamp
to
guide
me
i
went
through
and
round
the
whole
place
there
were
many
massive
tombs
mostly
roughhewn
from
great
slabs
or
blocks
of
stone
some
of
them
were
marble
and
the
cutting
of
all
was
ancient
so
large
and
heavy
were
some
of
them
that
it
was
a
wonder
to
me
how
they
could
ever
have
been
brought
to
this
place
to
which
the
only
entrance
was
seemingly
the
narrow
tortuous
stairway
by
which
i
had
come
at
last
i
saw
near
one
end
of
the
crypt
a
great
chain
hanging
turning
the
light
upward
i
found
that
it
depended
from
a
ring
set
over
a
wide
opening
evidently
made
artificially
it
must
have
been
through
this
opening
that
the
great
sarcophagi
had
been
lowered
directly
underneath
the
hanging
chain
which
did
not
come
closer
to
the
ground
than
some
eight
or
ten
feet
was
a
huge
tomb
in
the
shape
of
a
rectangular
coffer
or
sarcophagus
it
was
open
save
for
a
huge
sheet
of
thick
glass
which
rested
above
it
on
two
thick
balks
of
dark
oak
cut
to
exceeding
smoothness
which
lay
across
it
one
at
either
end
on
the
far
side
from
where
i
stood
each
of
these
was
joined
to
another
oak
plank
also
cut
smooth
which
sloped
gently
to
the
rocky
floor
should
it
be
necessary
to
open
the
tomb
the
glass
could
be
made
to
slide
along
the
supports
and
descend
by
the
sloping
planks
naturally
curious
to
know
what
might
be
within
such
a
strange
receptacle
i
raised
the
lantern
depressing
its
lens
so
that
the
light
might
fall
within
then
i
started
back
with
a
cry
the
lantern
slipping
from
my
nerveless
hand
and
falling
with
a
ringing
sound
on
the
great
sheet
of
thick
glass
within
pillowed
on
soft
cushions
and
covered
with
a
mantle
woven
of
white
natural
fleece
sprigged
with
tiny
sprays
of
pine
wrought
in
gold
lay
the
body
of
a
womannone
other
than
my
beautiful
visitor
she
was
marble
white
and
her
long
black
eyelashes
lay
on
her
white
cheeks
as
though
she
slept
without
a
word
or
a
sound
save
the
sounds
made
by
my
hurrying
feet
on
the
stone
flooring
i
fled
up
the
steep
steps
and
through
the
dim
expanse
of
the
church
out
into
the
bright
sunlight
i
found
that
i
had
mechanically
raised
the
fallen
lamp
and
had
taken
it
with
me
in
my
flight
my
feet
naturally
turned
towards
home
it
was
all
instinctive

new
horror

1907
for
some
days
after
the
last
adventure
i
was
in
truth
in
a
halfdazed
condition
unable
to
think
sensibly
hardly
coherently
indeed
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
preserve
something
of
my
habitual
appearance
and
manner
however
my
first
test
happily
came
soon
and
when
i
was
once
through
it
i
reacquired
sufficient
selfconfidence
to
go
through
with
my
purpose
gradually
the
original
phase
of
stupefaction
passed
and
i
was
able
to
look
the
situation
in
the
face
i
knew
the
worst
now
at
any
rate
and
when
the
lowest
point
has
been
reached
things
must
begin
to
mend
still
i
was
wofully
sensitive
regarding
anything
which
might
affect
my
lady
of
the
shroud
or
even
my
opinion
of
her
i
even
began
to
dread
aunt
janets
secondsight
visions
or
dreams
these
had
a
fatal
habit
of
coming
so
near
to
fact
that
they
always
made
for
a
danger
of
discovery
i
had
to
realize
now
that
the
lady
of
the
shroud
might
indeed
be
a
vampireone
of
that
horrid
race
that
survives
death
and
carries
on
a
lifeindeath
existence
eternally
and
only
for
evil
indeed
i
began
to
expect
that
aunt
janet
would
ere
long
have
some
prophetic
insight
to
the
matter
she
had
been
so
wonderfully
correct
in
her
prophetic
surmises
with
regard
to
both
the
visits
to
my
room
that
it
was
hardly
possible
that
she
could
fail
to
take
cognizance
of
this
last
development
but
my
dread
was
not
justified
at
any
rate
i
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
by
any
force
or
exercise
of
her
occult
gift
she
might
cause
me
concern
by
the
discovery
of
my
secret
only
once
did
i
feel
that
actual
danger
in
that
respect
was
close
to
me
that
was
when
she
came
early
one
morning
and
rapped
at
my
door
when
i
called
out
who
is
that
what
is
it
she
said
in
an
agitated
way
thank
god
laddie
you
are
all
right
go
to
sleep
again
later
on
when
we
met
at
breakfast
she
explained
that
she
had
had
a
nightmare
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
she
thought
she
had
seen
me
in
the
crypt
of
a
great
church
close
beside
a
stone
coffin
and
knowing
that
such
was
an
ominous
subject
to
dream
about
came
as
soon
as
she
dared
to
see
if
i
was
all
right
her
mind
was
evidently
set
on
death
and
burial
for
she
went
on
by
the
way
rupert
i
am
told
that
the
great
church
on
time
top
of
the
cliff
across
the
creek
is
st
savas
where
the
great
people
of
the
country
used
to
be
buried
i
want
you
to
take
me
there
some
day
we
shall
go
over
it
and
look
at
the
tombs
and
monuments
together
i
really
think
i
should
be
afraid
to
go
alone
but
it
will
be
all
right
if
you
are
with
me
this
was
getting
really
dangerous
so
i
turned
it
aside
really
aunt
janet
im
afraid
it
wont
do
if
you
go
off
to
weird
old
churches
and
fill
yourself
up
with
a
fresh
supply
of
horrors
i
dont
know
what
will
happen
youll
be
dreaming
dreadful
things
about
me
every
night
and
neither
you
nor
i
shall
get
any
sleep
it
went
to
my
heart
to
oppose
her
in
any
wish
and
also
this
kind
of
chaffy
opposition
might
pain
her
but
i
had
no
alternative
the
matter
was
too
serious
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
should
aunt
janet
go
to
the
church
she
would
surely
want
to
visit
the
crypt
should
she
do
so
and
there
notice
the
glasscovered
tombas
she
could
not
help
doingthe
lord
only
knew
what
would
happen
she
had
already
secondsighted
a
woman
being
married
to
me
and
before
i
myself
knew
that
i
had
such
a
hope
what
might
she
not
reveal
did
she
know
where
the
woman
came
from
it
may
have
been
that
her
power
of
second
sight
had
to
rest
on
some
basis
of
knowledge
or
belief
and
that
her
vision
was
but
some
intuitive
perception
of
my
own
subjective
thought
but
whatever
it
was
it
should
be
stoppedat
all
hazards
this
whole
episode
set
me
thinking
introspectively
and
led
me
gradually
but
imperatively
to
selfanalysisnot
of
powers
but
of
motives
i
found
myself
before
long
examining
myself
as
to
what
were
my
real
intentions
i
thought
at
first
that
this
intellectual
process
was
an
exercise
of
pure
reason
but
soon
discarded
this
as
inadequateeven
impossible
reason
is
a
cold
manifestation
this
feeling
which
swayed
and
dominated
me
is
none
other
than
passion
which
is
quick
hot
and
insistent
as
for
myself
the
selfanalysis
could
lead
to
but
one
resultthe
expression
to
myself
of
the
reality
and
definiteness
of
an
alreadyformed
though
unconscious
intention
i
wished
to
do
the
woman
goodto
serve
her
in
some
wayto
secure
her
some
benefit
by
any
means
no
matter
how
difficult
which
might
be
within
my
power
i
knew
that
i
loved
herloved
her
most
truly
and
fervently
there
was
no
need
for
selfanalysis
to
tell
me
that
and
moreover
no
selfanalysis
or
any
other
mental
process
that
i
knew
of
could
help
my
one
doubt
whether
she
was
an
ordinary
woman
or
an
extraordinary
woman
for
the
matter
of
that
in
some
sore
and
terrible
straits
or
else
one
who
lay
under
some
dreadful
condition
only
partially
alive
and
not
mistress
of
herself
or
her
acts
whichever
her
condition
might
be
there
was
in
my
own
feeling
a
superfluity
of
affection
for
her
the
selfanalysis
taught
me
one
thing
at
any
ratethat
i
had
for
her
to
start
with
an
infinite
pity
which
had
softened
towards
her
my
whole
being
and
had
already
mastered
merely
selfish
desire
out
of
it
i
began
to
find
excuses
for
her
every
act
in
the
doing
so
i
knew
now
though
perhaps
i
did
not
at
the
time
the
process
was
going
on
that
my
view
in
its
true
inwardness
was
of
her
as
a
living
womanthe
woman
i
loved
in
the
forming
of
our
ideas
there
are
different
methods
of
work
as
though
the
analogy
with
material
life
holds
good
in
the
building
of
a
house
for
instance
there
are
many
persons
employed
men
of
different
trades
and
occupationsarchitect
builder
masons
carpenters
plumbers
and
a
host
of
othersand
all
these
with
the
officials
of
each
guild
or
trade
so
in
the
world
of
thought
and
feelings
knowledge
and
understanding
come
through
various
agents
each
competent
to
its
task
how
far
pity
reacted
with
love
i
knew
not
i
only
knew
that
whatever
her
state
might
be
were
she
living
or
dead
i
could
find
in
my
heart
no
blame
for
the
lady
of
the
shroud
it
could
not
be
that
she
was
dead
in
the
real
conventional
way
for
after
all
the
dead
do
not
walk
the
earth
in
corporal
substance
even
if
there
be
spirits
which
take
the
corporal
form
this
woman
was
of
actual
form
and
weight
how
could
i
doubt
that
at
all
eventsi
who
had
held
her
in
my
arms
might
it
not
be
that
she
was
not
quite
dead
and
that
it
had
been
given
to
me
to
restore
her
to
life
again
ah
that
would
be
indeed
a
privilege
well
worth
the
giving
my
life
to
accomplish
that
such
a
thing
may
be
is
possible
surely
the
old
myths
were
not
absolute
inventions
they
must
have
had
a
basis
somewhere
in
fact
may
not
the
worldold
story
of
orpheus
and
eurydice
have
been
based
on
some
deeplying
principle
or
power
of
human
nature
there
is
not
one
of
us
but
has
wished
at
some
time
to
bring
back
the
dead
ay
and
who
has
not
felt
that
in
himself
or
herself
was
power
in
the
deep
love
for
our
dead
to
make
them
quick
again
did
we
but
know
the
secret
of
how
it
was
to
be
done
for
myself
i
have
seen
such
mysteries
that
i
am
open
to
conviction
regarding
things
not
yet
explained
these
have
been
of
course
amongst
savages
or
those
oldworld
people
who
have
brought
unchecked
traditions
and
beliefsay
and
powers
toodown
the
ages
from
the
dim
days
when
the
world
was
young
when
forces
were
elemental
and
natures
handiwork
was
experimental
rather
than
completed
some
of
these
wonders
may
have
been
older
still
than
the
accepted
period
of
our
own
period
of
creation
may
we
not
have
today
other
wonders
different
only
in
method
but
not
more
susceptible
of
belief
obiism
and
fanteeism
have
been
exercised
in
my
own
presence
and
their
results
proved
by
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
and
other
senses
so
too
have
stranger
rites
with
the

object
and
the
same
success
in
the
far
pacific
islands
so
too
in
india
and
china
in
thibet
and
in
the
golden
chersonese
on
all
and
each
of
these
occasions
there
was
on
my
own
part
enough
belief
to
set
in
motion
the
powers
of
understanding
and
there
were
no
moral
scruples
to
stand
in
the
way
of
realization
those
whose
lives
are

i
had
heard
long
ago
that
second
sight
is
a
terrible
gift
even
to
its
possessor
i
am
now
inclined
not
only
to
believe
but
to
understand
it
aunt
janet
has
made
such
a
practice
of
it
of
late
that
i
go
in
constant
dread
of
discovery
of
my
secret
she
seems
to
parallel
me
all
the
time
whatever
i
may
do
it
is
like
a
sort
of
dual
existence
to
her
for
she
is
her
dear
old
self
all
the
time
and
yet
some
other
person
with
a
sort
of
intellectual
kit
of
telescope
and
notebook
which
are
eternally
used
on
me
i
know
they
are
for
me
toofor
what
she
considers
my
good
but
all
the
same
it
makes
an
embarrassment
happily
second
sight
cannot
speak
as
clearly
as
it
sees
or
rather
as
it
understands
for
the
translation
of
the
vague
beliefs
which
it
inculcates
is
both
nebulous
and
uncertaina
sort
of
delphic
oracle
which
always
says
things
which
no
one
can
make
out
at
the
time
but
which
can
be
afterwards
read
in
any
one
of
several
ways
this
is
all
right
for
in
my
case
it
is
a
kind
of
safety
but
then
aunt
janet
is
a
very
clever
woman
and
some
time
she
herself
may
be
able
to
understand
then
she
may
begin
to
put
two
and
two
together
when
she
does
that
it
will
not
be
long
before
she
knows
more
than
i
do
of
the
facts
of
the
whole
affair
and
her
reading
of
them
and
of
the
lady
of
the
shroud
round
whom
they
circle
may
not
be
the
same
as
mine
well
that
will
be
all
right
too
aunt
janet
loves
megod
knows
i
have
good
reason
to
know
that
all
through
these
yearsand
whatever
view
she
may
take
her
acts
will
be
all
i
could
wish
but
i
shall
come
in
for
a
good
lot
of
scolding
i
am
sure
by
the
way
i
ought
to
think
of
that
if
aunt
janet
scolds
me
it
is
a
pretty
good
proof
that
i
ought
to
be
scolded
i
wonder
if
i
dare
tell
her
all
no
it
is
too
strange
she
is
only
a
woman
after
all
and
if
she
knew
i
loved



i
wish
i
knew
her
name
and
thoughtas
i
might
myself
do
only
that
i
resist
itthat
she
is
not
alive
at
all
well
what
she
would
either
think
or
do
beats
me
i
suppose
she
would
want
to
slipper
me
as
she
used
to
do
when
i
was
a
wee

i
really
could
not
go
on
seriously
last
night
the
idea
of
aunt
janet
giving
me
a
licking
as
in
the
dear
old
days
made
me
laugh
so
much
that
nothing
in
the
world
seemed
serious
then
oh
aunt
janet
is
all
right
whatever
comes
that
i
am
sure
of
so
i
neednt
worry
over
it
a
good
thing
too
there
will
be
plenty
to
worry
about
without
that
i
shall
not
check
her
telling
me
of
her
visions
however
i
may
learn
something
from
them
for
the
last
fourandtwenty
hours
i
have
whilst
awake
been
looking
over
aunt
janets
books
of
which
i
brought
a
wheen
down
here
gee
whizz
no
wonder
the
old
dear
is
superstitious
when
she
is
filled
up
to
the
back
teeth
with
that
sort
of
stuff
there
may
be
some
truth
in
some
of
those
yarns
those
who
wrote
them
may
believe
in
them
or
some
of
them
at
all
events
but
as
to
coherence
or
logic
or
any
sort
of
reasonable
or
instructive
deduction
they
might
as
well
have
been
written
by
so
many
hens
these
occult
bookmakers
seem
to
gather
only
a
lot
of
bare
bald
facts
which
they
put
down
in
the
most
uninteresting
way
possible
they
go
by
quantity
only
one
story
of
the
kind
well
examined
and
with
logical
comments
would
be
more
convincing
to
a

party

a

there
is
evidently
something
up
in
the
country
the
mountaineers
are
more
uneasy
than
they
have
been
as
yet
there
is
constant
going
to
and
fro
amongst
them
mostly
at
night
and
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
i
spend
many
hours
in
my
room
in
the
eastern
tower
from
which
i
can
watch
the
woods
and
gather
from
signs
the
passing
to
and
fro
but
with
all
this
activity
no
one
has
said
to
me
a
word
on
the
subject
it
is
undoubtedly
a
disappointment
to
me
i
had
hoped
that
the
mountaineers
had
come
to
trust
me
that
gathering
at
which
they
wanted
to
fire
their
guns
for
me
gave
me
strong
hopes
but
now
it
is
apparent
that
they
do
not
trust
me
in
fullas
yet
at
all
events
well
i
must
not
complain
it
is
all
only
right
and
just
as
yet
i
have
done
nothing
to
prove
to
them
the
love
and
devotion
that
i
feel
to
the
country
i
know
that
such
individuals
as
i
have
met
trust
me
and
i
believe
like
me
but
the
trust
of
a
nation
is
different
that
has
to
be
won
and
tested
he
who
would
win
it
must
justify
and
in
a
way
that
only
troublous
times
can
allow
no
nation
willcangive
full
meed
of
honour
to
a
stranger
in
times
of
peace
why
should
it
i
must
not
forget
that
i
am
here
a
stranger
in
the
land
and
that
to
the
great
mass
of
people
even
my
name
is
unknown
perhaps
they
will
know
me
better
when
rooke
comes
back
with
that
store
of
arms
and
ammunition
that
he
has
bought
and
the
little
warship
he
has
got
from
south
america
when
they
see
that
i
hand
over
the
whole
lot
to
the
nation
without
a
string
on
them
they
may
begin
to
believe
in
the
meantime
all
i
can
do
is
to
wait
it
will
all
come
right
in
time
i
have
no
doubt
and
if
it
doesnt
come
right
well
we
can
only
die
once
is
that
so
what
about
my
lady
of
the
shroud
i
must
not
think
of
that
or
of
her
in
this
gallery
love
and
war
are
separate
and
may
not
mixcannot
mix
if
it
comes
to
that
i
must
be
wise
in
the
matter
and
if
i
have
got
the
hump
in
any
degree
whatever
must
not
show
it
but
one
thing
is
certain
something
is
up
and
it
must
be
the
turks
from
what
the
vladika
said
at
that
meeting
they
have
some
intention
of
an
attack
on
the
blue
mountains
if
that
be
so
we
must
be
ready
and
perhaps
i
can
help
there
the
forces
must
be
organized
we
must
have
some
method
of
communication
in
this
country
where
are
neither
roads
nor
railways
nor
telegraphs
we
must
establish
a
signalling
system
of
some
sort
that
i
can
begin
at
once
i
can
make
a
code
or
adapt
one
that
i
have
used
elsewhere
already
i
shall
rig
up
a
semaphore
on
the
top
of
the
castle
which
can
be
seen
for
an
enormous
distance
around
i
shall
train
a
number
of
men
to
be
facile
in
signalling
and
then
should
need
come
i
may
be
able
to
show
the
mountaineers
that
i
am
fit
to
live
in
their
hearts



and
all
this
work
may
prove
an
anodyne
to
pain
of
another
kind
it
will
help
at
any
rate
to
keep
my
mind
occupied
whilst
i
am
waiting
for
another
visit
from

the
two
weeks
that
have
passed
have
been
busy
and
may
as
time
goes
on
prove
eventful
i
really
think
they
have
placed
me
in
a
different
position
with
the
blue
mountaineerscertainly
so
far
as
those
in
this
part
of
the
country
are
concerned
they
are
no
longer
suspicious
of
mewhich
is
much
though
they
have
not
yet
received
me
into
their
confidence
i
suppose
this
will
come
in
time
but
i
must
not
try
to
hustle
them
already
they
are
willing
so
far
as
i
can
see
to
use
me
to
their
own
ends
they
accepted
the
signalling
idea
very
readily
and
are
quite
willing
to
drill
as
much
as
i
like
this
can
be
and
i
think
is
in
its
way
a
pleasure
to
them
they
are
born
soldiers
every
man
of
them
and
practice
together
is
only
a
realization
of
their
own
wishes
and
a
further
development
of
their
powers
i
think
i
can
understand
the
trend
of
their
thoughts
and
what
ideas
of
public
policy
lie
behind
them
in
all
that
we
have
attempted
together
as
yet
they
are
themselves
in
absolute
power
it
rests
with
them
to
carry
out
any
ideas
i
may
suggest
so
they
do
not
fear
any
assumption
of
power
or
governance
on
my
part
thus
so
long
as
they
keep
secret
from
me
both
their
ideas
of
high
policy
and
their
immediate
intentions
i
am
powerless
to
do
them
ill
and
i
may
be
of
service
should
occasion
arise
well
all
told
this
is
much
already
they
accept
me
as
an
individual
not
merely
one
of
the
mass
i
am
pretty
sure
that
they
are
satisfied
of
my
personal
bona
fides
it
is
policy
and
not
mistrust
that
hedges
me
in
well
policy
is
a
matter
of
time
they
are
a
splendid
people
but
if
they
knew
a
little
more
than
they
do
they
would
understand
that
the
wisest
of
all
policies
is
trustwhen
it
can
be
given
i
must
hold
myself
in
check
and
never
be
betrayed
into
a
harsh
thought
towards
them
poor
souls
with
a
thousand
years
behind
them
of
turkish
aggression
strenuously
attempted
by
both
force
and
fraud
no
wonder
they
are
suspicious
likewise
every
other
nation
with
whom
they
have
ever
come
in
contactexcept
one
my
ownhas
deceived
or
betrayed
them
anyhow
they
are
fine
soldiers
and
before
long
we
shall
have
an
army
that
cannot
be
ignored
if
i
can
get
so
that
they
trust
me
i
shall
ask
sir
colin
to
come
out
here
he
would
be
a
splendid
head
for
their
army
his
great
military
knowledge
and
tactical
skill
would
come
in
well
it
makes
me
glow
to
think
of
what
an
army
he
would
turn
out
of
this
splendid
material
and
one
especially
adapted
for
the
style
of
fighting
which
would
be
necessary
in
this
country
if
a
mere
amateur
like
myself
who
has
only
had
experience
of
organizing
the
wildest
kind
of
savages
has
been
able
to
advance
or
compact
their
individual
style
of
fighting
into
systematic
effort
a
great
soldier
like
mackelpie
will
bring
them
to
perfection
as
a
fighting
machine
our
highlanders
when
they
come
out
will
foregather
with
them
as
mountaineers
always
do
with
each
other
then
we
shall
have
a
force
which
can
hold
its
own
against
any
odds
i
only
hope
that
rooke
will
be
returning
soon
i
want
to
see
those
ingismalbron
rifles
either
safely
stored
in
the
castle
or
what
is
better
divided
up
amongst
the
mountaineersa
thing
which
will
be
done
at
the
very
earliest
moment
that
i
can
accomplish
it
i
have
a
conviction
that
when
these
men
have
received
their
arms
and
ammunition
from
me
they
will
understand
me
better
and
not
keep
any
secrets
from
me
all
this
fortnight
when
i
was
not
drilling
or
going
about
amongst
the
mountaineers
and
teaching
them
the
code
which
i
have
now
got
perfected
i
was
exploring
the
side
of
the
mountain
nearest
to
here
i
could
not
bear
to
be
still
it
is
torture
to
me
to
be
idle
in
my
present
condition
of
mind
regarding
my
lady
of
the
shroud



strange
i
do
not
mind
mentioning
the
word
to
myself
now
i
used
to
at
first
but
that
bitterness
has
all
gone
away

i
was
so
restless
early
this
morning
that
before
daylight
i
was
out
exploring
on
the
mountainside
by
chance
i
came
across
a
secret
place
just
as
the
day
was
breaking
indeed
it
was
by
the
change
of
light
as
the
first
sunrays
seemed
to
fall
down
the
mountainside
that
my
attention
was
called
to
an
opening
shown
by
a
light
behind
it
it
was
indeed
a
secret
placeso
secret
that
i
thought
at
first
i
should
keep
it
to
myself
in
such
a
place
as
this
either
to
hide
in
or
to
be
able
to
prevent
anyone
else
hiding
in
might
on
occasion
be
an
asset
of
safety
when
however
i
saw
indications
rather
than
traces
that
someone
had
already
used
it
to
camp
in
i
changed
my
mind
and
thought
that
whenever
i
should
get
an
opportunity
i
would
tell
the
vladika
of
it
as
he
is
a
man
on
whose
discretion
i
can
rely
if
we
ever
have
a
war
here
or
any
sort
of
invasion
it
is
just
such
places
that
may
be
dangerous
even
in
my
own
case
it
is
much
too
near
the
castle
to
be
neglected
the
indications
were
meagreonly
where
a
fire
had
been
on
a
little
shelf
of
rock
and
it
was
not
possible
through
the
results
of
burning
vegetation
or
scorched
grass
to
tell
how
long
before
the
fire
had
been
alight
i
could
only
guess
perhaps
the
mountaineers
might
be
able
to
tell
or
even
to
guess
better
than
i
could
but
i
am
not
so
sure
of
this
i
am
a
mountaineer
myself
and
with
larger
and
more
varied
experience
than
any
of
them
for
myself
though
i
could
not
be
certain
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
whoever
had
used
the
place
had
done
so
not
many
days
before
it
could
not
have
been
quite
recently
but
it
may
not
have
been
very
long
ago
whoever
had
used
it
had
covered
up
his
tracks
well
even
the
ashes
had
been
carefully
removed
and
the
place
where
they
had
lain
was
cleaned
or
swept
in
some
way
so
that
there
was
no
trace
on
the
spot
i
applied
some
of
my
west
african
experience
and
looked
on
the
rough
bark
of
the
trees
to
leeward
to
where
the
agitated
air
however
directed
must
have
come
unless
it
was
wanted
to
call
attention
to
the
place
by
the
scattered
woodashes
however
fine
i
found
traces
of
it
but
they
were
faint
there
had
not
been
rain
for
several
days
so
the
dust
must
have
been
blown
there
since
the
rain
had
fallen
for
it
was
still
dry
the
place
was
a
tiny
gorge
with
but
one
entrance
which
was
hidden
behind
a
barren
spur
of
rockjust
a
sort
of
long
fissure
jagged
and
curving
in
the
rock
like
a
fault
in
the
stratification
i
could
just
struggle
through
it
with
considerable
effort
holding
my
breath
here
and
there
so
as
to
reduce
my
depth
of
chest
within
it
was
treeclad
and
full
of
possibilities
of
concealment
as
i
came
away
i
marked
well
its
direction
and
approaches
noting
any
guiding
mark
which
might
aid
in
finding
it
by
day
or
night
i
explored
every
foot
of
ground
around
itin
front
on
each
side
and
above
but
from
nowhere
could
i
see
an
indication
of
its
existence
it
was
a
veritable
secret
chamber
wrought
by
the
hand
of
nature
itself
i
did
not
return
home
till
i
was
familiar
with
every
detail
near
and
around
it
this
new
knowledge
added
distinctly
to
my
sense
of
security
later
in
the
day
i
tried
to
find
the
vladika
or
any
mountaineer
of
importance
for
i
thought
that
such
a
hidingplace
which
had
been
used
so
recently
might
be
dangerous
and
especially
at
a
time
when
as
i
had
learned
at
the
meeting
where
they
did
not
fire
their
guns
that
there
may
have
been
spies
about
or
a
traitor
in
the
land
even
before
i
came
to
my
own
room
tonight
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
go
out
early
in
the
morning
and
find
some
proper
person
to
whom
to
impart
the
information
so
that
a
watch
might
be
kept
on
the
place
it
is
now
getting
on
for
midnight

i

uneasy
all

and
especially
so
this
evening
i
think
it
must
have
been
my
absence
at
the
usual
breakfasthour
which
got
on
her
nerves
and
that
unsatisfied
mental

psychical

the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
in
my
room
which
chimes
on
the
notes
of
the
clock
at
st
jamess
palace
was
striking
midnight
when
i
opened
the
glass
door
on
the
terrace
i
had
put
out
my
lights
before
i
drew
the
curtain
as
i
wished
to
see
the
full
effect
of
the
moonlight
now
that
the
rainy
season
is
over
the
moon
is
quite
as
beautiful
as
it
was
in
the
wet
and
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
i
was
in
evening
dress
with
a
smokingjacket
in
lieu
of
a
coat
and
i
felt
the
air
mild
and
mellow
on
the
warm
side
as
i
stood
on
the
terrace
but
even
in
that
bright
moonlight
the
further
corners
of
the
great
garden
were
full
of
mysterious
shadows
i
peered
into
them
as
well
as
i
couldand
my
eyes
are
pretty
good
naturally
and
are
well
trained
there
was
not
the
least
movement
the
air
was
as
still
as
death
the
foliage
as
still
as
though
wrought
in
stone
i
looked
for
quite
a
long
time
in
the
hope
of
seeing
something
of
my
lady
the
quarters
chimed
several
times
but
i
stood
on
unheeding
at
last
i
thought
i
saw
far
off
in
the
very
corner
of
the
old
defending
wall
a
flicker
of
white
it
was
but
momentary
and
could
hardly
have
accounted
in
itself
for
the
way
my
heart
beat
i
controlled
myself
and
stood
as
though
i
too
were
a
graven
image
i
was
rewarded
by
seeing
presently
another
gleam
of
white
and
then
an
unspeakable
rapture
stole
over
me
as
i
realized
that
my
lady
was
coming
as
she
had
come
before
i
would
have
hurried
out
to
meet
her
but
that
i
knew
well
that
this
would
not
be
in
accord
with
her
wishes
so
thinking
to
please
her
i
drew
back
into
the
room
i
was
glad
i
had
done
so
when
from
the
dark
corner
where
i
stood
i
saw
her
steal
up
the
marble
steps
and
stand
timidly
looking
in
at
the
door
then
after
a
long
pause
came
a
whisper
as
faint
and
sweet
as
the
music
of
a
distant
aeolian
harp
are
you
there
may
i
come
in
answer
me
i
am
lonely
and
in
fear
for
answer
i
emerged
from
my
dim
corner
so
swiftly
that
she
was
startled
i
could
hear
from
the
quivering
intake
of
her
breath
that
she
was
strivinghappily
with
successto
suppress
a
shriek
come
in
i
said
quietly
i
was
waiting
for
you
for
i
felt
that
you
would
come
i
only
came
in
from
the
terrace
when
i
saw
you
coming
lest
you
might
fear
that
anyone
might
see
us
that
is
not
possible
but
i
thought
you
wished
that
i
should
be
careful
i
didi
do
she
answered
in
a
low
sweet
voice
but
very
firmly
but
never
avoid
precaution
there
is
nothing
that
may
not
happen
here
there
may
be
eyes
where
we
least
expector
suspect
them
as
she
spoke
the
last
words
solemnly
and
in
a
low
whisper
she
was
entering
the
room
i
closed
the
glass
door
and
bolted
it
rolled
back
the
steel
grille
and
pulled
the
heavy
curtain
then
when
i
had
lit
a
candle
i
went
over
and
put
a
light
to
the
fire
in
a
few
seconds
the
dry
wood
had
caught
and
the
flames
were
beginning
to
rise
and
crackle
she
had
not
objected
to
my
closing
the
window
and
drawing
the
curtain
neither
did
she
make
any
comment
on
my
lighting
the
fire
she
simply
acquiesced
in
it
as
though
it
was
now
a
matter
of
course
when
i
made
the
pile
of
cushions
before
it
as
on
the
occasion
of
her
last
visit
she
sank
down
on
them
and
held
out
her
white
trembling
hands
to
the
warmth
she
was
different
tonight
from
what
she
had
been
on
either
of
the
two
former
visits
from
her
present
bearing
i
arrived
at
some
gauge
of
her
selfconcern
her
selfrespect
now
that
she
was
dry
and
not
overmastered
by
wet
and
cold
a
sweet
and
gracious
dignity
seemed
to
shine
from
her
enwrapping
her
as
it
were
with
a
luminous
veil
it
was
not
that
she
was
by
this
made
or
shown
as
cold
or
distant
or
in
any
way
harsh
or
forbidding
on
the
contrary
protected
by
this
dignity
she
seemed
much
more
sweet
and
genial
than
before
it
was
as
though
she
felt
that
she
could
afford
to
stoop
now
that
her
loftiness
was
realizedthat
her
position
was
recognized
and
secure
if
her
inherent
dignity
made
an
impenetrable
nimbus
round
her
this
was
against
others
she
herself
was
not
bound
by
it
or
to
be
bound
so
marked
was
this
so
entirely
and
sweetly
womanly
did
she
appear
that
i
caught
myself
wondering
in
flashes
of
thought
which
came
as
sharp
periods
of
doubting
judgment
between
spells
of
unconscious
fascination
how
i
had
ever
come
to
think
she
was
aught
but
perfect
woman
as
she
rested
half
sitting
and
half
lying
on
the
pile
of
cushions
she
was
all
grace
and
beauty
and
charm
and
sweetnessthe
veritable
perfect
woman
of
the
dreams
of
a
man
be
he
young
or
old
to
have
such
a
woman
sit
by
his
hearth
and
hold
her
holy
of
holies
in
his
heart
might
well
be
a
rapture
to
any
man
even
an
hour
of
such
entrancing
joy
might
be
well
won
by
a
lifetime
of
pain
by
the
balance
of
a
long
life
sacrificed
by
the
extinction
of
life
itself
quick
behind
the
record
of
such
thoughts
came
the
answer
to
the
doubt
they
challenged
if
it
should
turn
out
that
she
was
not
living
at
all
but
one
of
the
doomed
and
pitiful
undead
then
so
much
more
on
account
of
her
very
sweetness
and
beauty
would
be
the
winning
of
her
back
to
life
and
heaveneven
were
it
that
she
might
find
happiness
in
the
heart
and
in
the
arms
of
another
man
once
when
i
leaned
over
the
hearth
to
put
fresh
logs
on
the
fire
my
face
was
so
close
to
hers
that
i
felt
her
breath
on
my
cheek
it
thrilled
me
to
feel
even
the
suggestion
of
that
ineffable
contact
her
breath
was
sweetsweet
as
the
breath
of
a
calf
sweet
as
the
whiff
of
a
summer
breeze
across
beds
of
mignonette
how
could
anyone
believe
for
a
moment
that
such
sweet
breath
could
come
from
the
lips
of
the
deadthe
dead
in
esse
or
in
possethat
corruption
could
send
forth
fragrance
so
sweet
and
pure
it
was
with
satisfied
happiness
that
as
i
looked
at
her
from
my
stool
i
saw
the
dancing
of
the
flames
from
the
beechlogs
reflected
in
her
glorious
black
eyes
and
the
stars
that
were
hidden
in
them
shine
out
with
new
colours
and
new
lustre
as
they
gleamed
rising
and
falling
like
hopes
and
fears
as
the
light
leaped
so
did
smiles
of
quiet
happiness
flit
over
her
beautiful
face
the
merriment
of
the
joyous
flames
being
reflected
in
everchanging
dimples
at
first
i
was
a
little
disconcerted
whenever
my
eyes
took
note
of
her
shroud
and
there
came
a
momentary
regret
that
the
weather
had
not
been
again
bad
so
that
there
might
have
been
compulsion
for
her
putting
on
another
garmentanything
lacking
the
loathsomeness
of
that
pitiful
wrapping
little
by
little
however
this
feeling
disappeared
and
i
found
no
matter
for
even
dissatisfaction
in
her
wrapping
indeed
my
thoughts
found
inward
voice
before
the
subject
was
dismissed
from
my
mind
one
becomes
accustomed
to
anythingeven
a
shroud
but
the
thought
was
followed
by
a
submerging
wave
of
pity
that
she
should
have
had
such
a
dreadful
experience
byandby
we
seemed
both
to
forget
everythingi
know
i
didexcept
that
we
were
man
and
woman
and
close
together
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
and
the
circumstances
did
not
seem
of
momentnot
worth
even
a
passing
thought
we
still
sat
apart
and
said
little
if
anything
i
cannot
recall
a
single
word
that
either
of
us
spoke
whilst
we
sat
before
the
fire
but
other
language
than
speech
came
into
play
the
eyes
told
their
own
story
as
eyes
can
do
and
more
eloquently
than
lips
whilst
exercising
their
function
of
speech
question
and
answer
followed
each
other
in
this
satisfying
language
and
with
an
unspeakable
rapture
i
began
to
realize
that
my
affection
was
returned
under
these
circumstances
it
was
unrealizable
that
there
should
be
any
incongruity
in
the
whole
affair
i
was
not
myself
in
the
mood
of
questioning
i
was
diffident
with
that
diffidence
which
comes
alone
from
true
love
as
though
it
were
a
necessary
emanation
from
that
delightful
and
overwhelming
and
commanding
passion
in
her
presence
there
seemed
to
surge
up
within
me
that
which
forbade
speech
speech
under
present
conditions
would
have
seemed
to
me
unnecessary
imperfect
and
even
vulgarly
overt
she
too
was
silent
but
now
that
i
am
alone
and
memory
is
alone
with
me
i
am
convinced
that
she
also
had
been
happy
no
not
that
exactly
happiness
is
not
the
word
to
describe
either
her
feeling
or
my
own
happiness
is
more
active
a
more
conscious
enjoyment
we
had
been
content
that
expresses
our
condition
perfectly
and
now
that
i
can
analyze
my
own
feeling
and
understand
what
the
word
implies
i
am
satisfied
of
its
accuracy
content
has
both
a
positive
and
negative
meaning
or
antecedent
condition
it
implies
an
absence
of
disturbing
conditions
as
well
as
of
wants
also
it
implies
something
positive
which
has
been
won
or
achieved
or
which
has
accrued
in
our
state
of
mindfor
though
it
may
be
presumption
on
my
part
i
am
satisfied
that
our
ideas
were
mutualit
meant
that
we
had
reached
an
understanding
whence
all
that
might
come
must
be
for
good
god
grant
that
it
may
be
so
as
we
sat
silent
looking
into
each
others
eyes
and
whilst
the
stars
in
hers
were
now
full
of
latent
fire
perhaps
from
the
reflection
of
the
flames
she
suddenly
sprang
to
her
feet
instinctively
drawing
the
horrible
shroud
round
her
as
she
rose
to
her
full
height
in
a
voice
full
of
lingering
emotion
as
of
one
who
is
acting
under
spiritual
compulsion
rather
than
personal
will
she
said
in
a
whisper
i
must
go
at
once
i
feel
the
morning
drawing
nigh
i
must
be
in
my
place
when
the
light
of
day
comes
she
was
so
earnest
that
i
felt
i
must
not
oppose
her
wish
so
i
too
sprang
to
my
feet
and
ran
towards
the
window
i
pulled
the
curtain
aside
sufficiently
far
for
me
to
press
back
the
grille
and
reach
the
glass
door
the
latch
of
which
i
opened
i
passed
behind
the
curtain
again
and
held
the
edge
of
it
back
so
that
she
could
go
through
for
an
instant
she
stopped
as
she
broke
the
long
silence
you
are
a
true
gentleman
and
my
friend
you
understand
all
i
wish
out
of
the
depth
of
my
heart
i
thank
you
she
held
out
her
beautiful
highbred
hand
i
took
it
in
both
mine
as
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
raised
it
to
my
lips
its
touch
made
me
quiver
she
too
trembled
as
she
looked
down
at
me
with
a
glance
which
seemed
to
search
my
very
soul
the
stars
in
her
eyes
now
that
the
firelight
was
no
longer
on
them
had
gone
back
to
their
own
mysterious
silver
then
she
drew
her
hand
from
mine
very
very
gently
as
though
it
would
fain
linger
and
she
passed
out
behind
the
curtain
with
a
gentle
sweet
dignified
little
bow
which
left
me
on
my
knees
when
i
heard
the
glass
door
pulledto
gently
behind
her
i
rose
from
my
knees
and
hurried
without
the
curtain
just
in
time
to
watch
her
pass
down
the
steps
i
wanted
to
see
her
as
long
as
i
could
the
grey
of
morning
was
just
beginning
to
war
with
the
night
gloom
and
by
the
faint
uncertain
light
i
could
see
dimly
the
white
figure
flit
between
shrub
and
statue
till
finally
it
merged
in
the
far
darkness
i
stood
for
a
long
time
on
the
terrace
sometimes
looking
into
the
darkness
in
front
of
me
in
case
i
might
be
blessed
with
another
glimpse
of
her
sometimes
with
my
eyes
closed
so
that
i
might
recall
and
hold
in
my
mind
her
passage
down
the
steps
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
met
her
she
had
thrown
back
at
me
a
glance
as
she
stepped
on
the
white
path
below
the
terrace
with
the
glamour
over
me
of
that
look
which
was
all
love
and
enticement
i
could
have
dared
all
the
powers
that
be
when
the
grey
dawn
was
becoming
apparent
through
the
lightening
of
the
sky
i
returned
to
my
room
in
a
dazed
conditionhalf
hypnotized
by
lovei
went
to
bed
and
in
dreams
continued
to
think
all
happily
of
my
lady

1907
a
whole
week
has
gone
since
i
saw
my
love
there
it
is
no
doubt
whatever
is
left
in
my
mind
about
it
now
since
i
saw
her
my
passion
has
grown
and
grown
by
leaps
and
bounds
as
novelists
put
it
it
has
now
become
so
vast
as
to
overwhelm
me
to
wipe
out
all
thought
of
doubt
or
difficulty
i
suppose
it
must
be
what
men
sufferedsuffering
need
not
mean
painunder
enchantments
in
old
times
i
am
but
as
a
straw
whirled
in
the
resistless
eddies
of
a
whirlpool
i
feel
that
i
must
see
her
again
even
if
it
be
but
in
her
tomb
in
the
crypt
i
must
i
suppose
prepare
myself
for
the
venture
for
many
things
have
to
be
thought
of
the
visit
must
not
be
at
night
for
in
such
case
i
might
miss
her
did
she
come
to
me
again
here



the
morning
came
and
went
but
my
wish
and
intention
still
remained
and
so
in
the
full
tide
of
noon
with
the
sun
in
all
its
fiery
force
i
set
out
for
the
old
church
of
st
sava
i
carried
with
me
a
lantern
with
powerful
lens
i
had
wrapped
it
up
secretly
for
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
should
not
like
anyone
to
know
that
i
had
such
a
thing
with
me
on
this
occasion
i
had
no
misgivings
on
the
former
visit
i
had
for
a
moment
been
overwhelmed
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
body
of
the
woman
i
thought
i
lovedi
knew
it
nowlying
in
her
tomb
but
now
i
knew
all
and
it
was
to
see
this
woman
though
in
her
tomb
that
i
came
when
i
had
lit
my
lantern
which
i
did
as
soon
as
i
had
pushed
open
the
great
door
which
was
once
again
unlocked
i
turned
my
steps
to
the
steps
of
the
crypt
which
lay
behind
the
richly
carven
wood
screen
this
i
could
see
with
the
better
light
was
a
noble
piece
of
work
of
priceless
beauty
and
worth
i
tried
to
keep
my
heart
in
full
courage
with
thoughts
of
my
lady
and
of
the
sweetness
and
dignity
of
our
last
meeting
but
despite
all
it
sank
down
down
and
turned
to
water
as
i
passed
with
uncertain
feet
down
the
narrow
tortuous
steps
my
concern
i
am
now
convinced
was
not
for
myself
but
that
she
whom
i
adored
should
have
to
endure
such
a
fearful
place
as
anodyne
to
my
own
pain
i
thought
what
it
would
be
and
how
i
should
feel
when
i
should
have
won
for
her
a
way
out
of
that
horror
at
any
rate
this
thought
reassured
me
somewhat
and
restored
my
courage
it
was
in
something
of
the
same
fashion
which
has
hitherto
carried
me
out
of
tight
places
as
well
as
into
them
that
at
last
i
pushed
open
the
low
narrow
door
at
the
foot
of
the
rockhewn
staircase
and
entered
the
crypt
without
delay
i
made
my
way
to
the
glasscovered
tomb
set
beneath
the
hanging
chain
i
could
see
by
the
flashing
of
the
light
around
me
that
my
hand
which
held
the
lantern
trembled
with
a
great
effort
i
steadied
myself
and
raising
the
lantern
turned
its
light
down
into
the
sarcophagus
once
again
the
fallen
lantern
rang
on
the
tingling
glass
and
i
stood
alone
in
the
darkness
for
an
instant
almost
paralyzed
with
surprised
disappointment
the
tomb
was
empty
even
the
trappings
of
the
dead
had
been
removed
i
knew
not
what
happened
till
i
found
myself
groping
my
way
up
the
winding
stair
here
in
comparison
with
the
solid
darkness
of
the
crypt
it
seemed
almost
light
the
dim
expanse
of
the
church
sent
a
few
straggling
rays
down
the
vaulted
steps
and
as
i
could
see
be
it
never
so
dimly
i
felt
i
was
not
in
absolute
darkness
with
the
light
came
a
sense
of
power
and
fresh
courage
and
i
groped
my
way
back
into
the
crypt
again
there
by
now
and
again
lighting
matches
i
found
my
way
to
the
tomb
and
recovered
my
lantern
then
i
took
my
way
slowlyfor
i
wished
to
prove
if
not
my
own
courage
at
least
such
vestiges
of
selfrespect
as
the
venture
had
left
methrough
the
church
where
i
extinguished
my
lantern
and
out
through
the
great
door
into
the
open
sunlight
i
seemed
to
have
heard
both
in
the
darkness
of
the
crypt
and
through
the
dimness
of
the
church
mysterious
sounds
as
of
whispers
and
suppressed
breathing
but
the
memory
of
these
did
not
count
for
much
when
once
i
was
free
i
was
only
satisfied
of
my
own
consciousness
and
identity
when
i
found
myself
on
the
broad
rock
terrace
in
front
of
the
church
with
the
fierce
sunlight
beating
on
my
upturned
face
and
looking
downward
saw
far
below
me
the
rippled
blue
of
the
open
sea

week
has
elapseda
week
full
of
movement
of
many
kinds
and
in
many
waysbut
as
yet
i
have
had
no
tale

my

i

i

not
go
at

the
night

it

else
i
may

perhaps
never

the
days
have
been
full
of
national
movement
the
mountaineers
have
evidently
been
organizing
themselves
for
some
reason
which
i
cannot
quite
understand
and
which
they
have
hesitated
to
make
known
to
me
i
have
taken
care
not
to
manifest
any
curiosity
whatever
i
may
have
felt
this
would
certainly
arouse
suspicion
and
might
ultimately
cause
disaster
to
my
hopes
of
aiding
the
nation
in
their
struggle
to
preserve
their
freedom
these
fierce
mountaineers
are
strangelyalmost
undulysuspicious
and
the
only
way
to
win
their
confidence
is
to
begin
the
trusting
a
young
american
attache
of
the
embassy
at
vienna
who
had
made
a
journey
through
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
once
put
it
to
me
in
this
form
keep
your
head
shut
and
theyll
open
theirs
if
you
dont
theyll
open
it
for
youdown
to
the
chine
it
was
quite
apparent
to
me
that
they
were
completing
some
fresh
arrangements
for
signalling
with
a
code
of
their
own
this
was
natural
enough
and
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
the
measure
of
friendliness
already
shown
to
me
where
there
are
neither
telegraphs
railways
nor
roads
any
effective
form
of
communication
mustcan
only
be
purely
personal
and
so
if
they
wish
to
keep
any
secret
amongst
themselves
they
must
preserve
the
secret
of
their
code
i
should
have
dearly
liked
to
learn
their
new
code
and
their
manner
of
using
it
but
as
i
want
to
be
a
helpful
friend
to
themand
as
this
implies
not
only
trust
but
the
appearance
of
iti
had
to
school
myself
to
patience
this
attitude
so
far
won
their
confidence
that
before
we
parted
at
our
last
meeting
after
most
solemn
vows
of
faith
and
secrecy
they
took
me
into
the
secret
this
was
however
only
to
the
extent
of
teaching
me
the
code
and
method
they
still
withheld
from
me
rigidly
the
fact
or
political
secret
or
whatever
it
was
that
was
the
mainspring
of
their
united
action
when
i
got
home
i
wrote
down
whilst
it
was
fresh
in
my
memory
all
they
told
me
this
script
i
studied
until
i
had
it
so
thoroughly
by
heart
that
i
could
not
forget
it
then
i
burned
the
paper
however
there
is
now
one
gain
at

with
my

1907
last
night
i
had
a
new
experience
of
my
lady
of
the
shroudin
so
far
as
form
was
concerned
at
any
rate
i
was
in
bed
and
just
falling
asleep
when
i
heard
a
queer
kind
of
scratching
at
the
glass
door
of
the
terrace
i
listened
acutely
my
heart
beating
hard
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
low
down
close
to
the
floor
i
jumped
out
of
bed
ran
to
the
window
and
pulling
aside
the
heavy
curtains
looked
out
the
garden
looked
as
usual
ghostly
in
the
moonlight
but
there
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
movement
anywhere
and
no
one
was
on
or
near
the
terrace
i
looked
eagerly
down
to
where
the
sound
had
seemed
to
come
from
there
just
inside
the
glass
door
as
though
it
had
been
pushed
under
the
door
lay
a
paper
closely
folded
in
several
laps
i
picked
it
up
and
opened
it
i
was
all
in
a
tumult
for
my
heart
told
me
whence
it
came
inside
was
written
in
english
in
a
large
sprawling
hand
such
as
might
be
from
an
english
child
of
seven
or
eight
meet
me
at
the
flagstaff
on
the
rock
i
knew
the
place
of
course
on
the
farthermost
point
of
the
rock
on
which
the
castle
stands
is
set
a
high
flagstaff
whereon
in
old
time
the
banner
of
the
vissarion
family
flew
at
some
faroff
time
when
the
castle
had
been
liable
to
attack
this
point
had
been
strongly
fortified
indeed
in
the
days
when
the
bow
was
a
martial
weapon
it
must
have
been
quite
impregnable
a
covered
gallery
with
loopholes
for
arrows
had
been
cut
in
the
solid
rock
running
right
round
the
point
quite
surrounding
the
flagstaff
and
the
great
boss
of
rock
on
whose
centre
it
was
reared
a
narrow
drawbridge
of
immense
strength
had
connectedin
peaceful
times
and
still
remainedthe
outer
point
of
rock
with
an
entrance
formed
in
the
outer
wall
and
guarded
with
flanking
towers
and
a
portcullis
its
use
was
manifestly
to
guard
against
surprise
from
this
point
only
could
be
seen
the
line
of
the
rocks
all
round
the
point
thus
any
secret
attack
by
boats
could
be
made
impossible
having
hurriedly
dressed
myself
and
taking
with
me
both
huntingknife
and
revolver
i
went
out
on
the
terrace
taking
the
precaution
unusual
to
me
of
drawing
the
grille
behind
me
and
locking
it
matters
around
the
castle
are
in
far
too
disturbed
a
condition
to
allow
the
taking
of
any
foolish
chances
either
in
the
way
of
being
unarmed
or
of
leaving
the
private
entrance
to
the
castle
open
i
found
my
way
through
the
rocky
passage
and
climbed
by
the
jacobs
ladder
fixed
on
the
rocka
device
of
convenience
in
time
of
peaceto
the
foot
of
the
flagstaff
i
was
all
on
fire
with
expectation
and
the
time
of
going
seemed
exceeding
long
so
i
was
additionally
disappointed
by
the
contrast
when
i
did
not
see
my
lady
there
when
i
arrived
however
my
heart
beat
freely
againperhaps
more
freely
than
everwhen
i
saw
her
crouching
in
the
shadow
of
the
castle
wall
from
where
she
was
she
could
not
be
seen
from
any
point
save
that
alone
which
i
occupied
even
from
there
it
was
only
her
white
shroud
that
was
conspicuous
through
the
deep
gloom
of
the
shadow
the
moonlight
was
so
bright
that
the
shadows
were
almost
unnaturally
black
i
rushed
over
towards
her
and
when
close
was
about
to
say
impulsively
why
did
you
leave
your
tomb
when
it
suddenly
struck
me
that
the
question
would
be
malapropos
and
embarrassing
in
many
ways
so
better
judgment
prevailing
i
said
instead
it
has
been
so
long
since
i
saw
you
it
has
seemed
an
eternity
to
me
her
answer
came
as
quickly
as
even
i
could
have
wished
she
spoke
impulsively
and
without
thought
it
has
been
long
to
me
too
oh
so
long
so
long
i
have
asked
you
to
come
out
here
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
so
much
that
i
could
not
wait
any
longer
i
have
been
hearthungry
for
a
sight
of
you
her
words
her
eager
attitude
the
ineffable
something
which
conveys
the
messages
of
the
heart
the
longing
expression
in
her
eyes
as
the
full
moonlight
fell
on
her
face
showing
the
stars
as
living
goldfor
in
her
eagerness
she
had
stepped
out
towards
me
from
the
shadowall
set
me
on
fire
without
a
thought
or
a
wordfor
it
was
nature
speaking
in
the
language
of
love
which
is
a
silent
tonguei
stepped
towards
her
and
took
her
in
my
arms
she
yielded
with
that
sweet
unconsciousness
which
is
the
perfection
of
love
as
if
it
was
in
obedience
to
some
command
uttered
before
the
beginning
of
the
world
probably
without
any
conscious
effort
on
either
sidei
know
there
was
none
on
mineour
mouths
met
in
the
first
kiss
of
love
at
the
time
nothing
in
the
meeting
struck
me
as
out
of
the
common
but
later
in
the
night
when
i
was
alone
and
in
darkness
whenever
i
thought
of
it
allits
strangeness
and
its
stranger
rapturei
could
not
but
be
sensible
of
the
bizarre
conditions
for
a
love
meeting
the
place
lonely
the
time
night
the
man
young
and
strong
and
full
of
life
and
hope
and
ambition
the
woman
beautiful
and
ardent
though
she
was
a
woman
seemingly
dead
clothed
in
the
shroud
in
which
she
had
been
wrapped
when
lying
in
her
tomb
in
the
crypt
of
the
old
church
whilst
we
were
together
anyhow
there
was
little
thought
of
the
kind
no
reasoning
of
any
kind
on
my
part
love
has
its
own
laws
and
its
own
logic
under
the
flagstaff
where
the
vissarion
banner
was
wont
to
flap
in
the
breeze
she
was
in
my
arms
her
sweet
breath
was
on
my
face
her
heart
was
beating
against
my
own
what
need
was
there
for
reason
at
all
inter
arma
silent
legesthe
voice
of
reason
is
silent
in
the
stress
of
passion
dead
she
may
be
or
undeada
vampire
with
one
foot
in
hell
and
one
on
earth
but
i
love
her
and
come
what
may
here
or
hereafter
she
is
mine
as
my
mate
we
shall
fare
along
together
whatsoever
the
end
may
be
or
wheresoever
our
path
may
lead
if
she
is
indeed
to
be
won
from
the
nethermost
hell
then
be
mine
the
task
but
to
go
back
to
the
record
when
i
had
once
started
speaking
to
her
in
words
of
passion
i
could
not
stop
i
did
not
want
toif
i
could
and
she
did
not
appear
to
wish
it
either
can
there
be
a
womanalive
or
deadwho
would
not
want
to
hear
the
rapture
of
her
lover
expressed
to
her
whilst
she
is
enclosed
in
his
arms
there
was
no
attempt
at
reticence
on
my
part
now
i
took
it
for
granted
that
she
knew
all
that
i
surmised
and
as
she
made
neither
protest
nor
comment
that
she
accepted
my
belief
as
to
her
indeterminate
existence
sometimes
her
eyes
would
be
closed
but
even
then
the
rapture
of
her
face
was
almost
beyond
belief
then
when
the
beautiful
eyes
would
open
and
gaze
on
me
the
stars
that
were
in
them
would
shine
and
scintillate
as
though
they
were
formed
of
living
fire
she
said
little
very
little
but
though
the
words
were
few
every
syllable
was
fraught
with
love
and
went
straight
to
the
very
core
of
my
heart
byandby
when
our
transport
had
calmed
to
joy
i
asked
when
i
might
next
see
her
and
how
and
where
i
might
find
her
when
i
should
want
to
she
did
not
reply
directly
but
holding
me
close
in
her
arms
whispered
in
my
ear
with
that
breathless
softness
which
is
a
lovers
rapture
of
speech
i
have
come
here
under
terrible
difficulties
not
only
because
i
love
youand
that
would
be
enoughbut
because
as
well
as
the
joy
of
seeing
you
i
wanted
to
warn
you
to
warn
me
why
i
queried
her
reply
came
with
a
bashful
hesitation
with
something
of
a
struggle
in
it
as
of
one
who
for
some
ulterior
reason
had
to
pick
her
words
there
are
difficulties
and
dangers
ahead
of
you
you
are
beset
with
them
and
they
are
all
the
greater
because
they
are
of
grim
necessity
hidden
from
you
you
cannot
go
anywhere
look
in
any
direction
do
anything
say
anything
but
it
may
be
a
signal
for
danger
my
dear
it
lurks
everywherein
the
light
as
well
as
in
the
darkness
in
the
open
as
well
as
in
the
secret
places
from
friends
as
well
as
foes
when
you
are
least
prepared
when
you
may
least
expect
it
oh
i
know
it
and
what
it
is
to
endure
for
i
share
it
for
youfor
your
dear
sake
my
darling
was
all
i
could
say
as
i
drew
her
again
closer
to
me
and
kissed
her
after
a
bit
she
was
calmer
seeing
this
i
came
back
to
the
subject
that
she
hadin
part
at
all
eventscome
to
me
to
speak
about
but
if
difficulty
and
danger
hedge
me
in
so
everlastingly
and
if
i
am
to
have
no
indication
whatever
of
its
kind
or
purpose
what
can
i
do
god
knows
i
would
willingly
guard
myselfnot
on
my
own
account
but
for
your
dear
sake
i
have
now
a
cause
to
live
and
be
strong
and
to
keep
all
my
faculties
since
it
may
mean
much
to
you
if
you
may
not
tell
me
details
may
you
not
indicate
to
me
some
line
of
conduct
of
action
that
would
be
most
in
accord
with
your
wishesor
rather
with
your
idea
of
what
would
be
best
she
looked
at
me
fixedly
before
speakinga
long
purposeful
loving
look
which
no
man
born
of
woman
could
misunderstand
then
she
spoke
slowly
deliberately
emphatically
be
bold
and
fear
not
be
true
to
yourself
to
meit
is
the
same
thing
these
are
the
best
guards
you
can
use
your
safety
does
not
rest
with
me
ah
i
wish
it
did
i
wish
to
god
it
did
in
my
inner
heart
it
thrilled
me
not
merely
to
hear
the
expression
of
her
wish
but
to
hear
her
use
the
name
of
god
as
she
did
i
understand
now
in
the
calm
of
this
place
and
with
the
sunlight
before
me
that
my
belief
as
to
her
being
all
womanliving
womanwas
not
quite
dead
but
though
at
the
moment
my
heart
did
not
recognize
the
doubt
my
brain
did
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
we
should
not
part
this
time
until
she
knew
that
i
had
seen
her
and
where
but
despite
my
own
thoughts
my
outer
ears
listened
greedily
as
she
went
on
as
for
me
you
may
not
find
me
but
i
shall
find
you
be
sure
and
now
we
must
say
goodnight
my
dear
my
dear
tell
me
once
again
that
you
love
me
for
it
is
a
sweetness
that
one
does
not
wish
to
foregoeven
one
who
wears
such
a
garment
as
thisand
rests
where
i
must
rest
as
she
spoke
she
held
up
part
of
her
cerements
for
me
to
see
what
could
i
do
but
take
her
once
again
in
my
arms
and
hold
her
close
close
god
knows
it
was
all
in
love
but
it
was
passionate
love
which
surged
through
my
every
vein
as
i
strained
her
dear
body
to
mine
but
yet
this
embrace
was
not
selfish
it
was
not
all
an
expression
of
my
own
passion
it
was
based
on
pitythe
pity
which
is
twinborn
with
true
love
breathless
from
our
kisses
when
presently
we
released
each
other
she
stood
in
a
glorious
rapture
like
a
white
spirit
in
the
moonlight
and
as
her
lovely
starlit
eyes
seemed
to
devour
me
she
spoke
in
a
languorous
ecstasy
oh
how
you
love
me
how
you
love
me
it
is
worth
all
i
have
gone
through
for
this
even
to
wearing
this
terrible
drapery
and
again
she
pointed
to
her
shroud
here
was
my
chance
to
speak
of
what
i
knew
and
i
took
it
i
know
i
know
moreover
i
know
that
awful
restingplace
i
was
interrupted
cut
short
in
the
midst
of
my
sentence
not
by
any
word
but
by
the
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
and
the
fearmastered
way
in
which
she
shrank
away
from
me
i
suppose
in
reality
she
could
not
be
paler
than
she
looked
when
the
colourabsorbing
moonlight
fell
on
her
but
on
the
instant
all
semblance
of
living
seemed
to
shrink
and
fall
away
and
she
looked
with
eyes
of
dread
as
if
in
i
some
awful
way
held
in
thrall
but
for
the
movement
of
the
pitiful
glance
she
would
have
seemed
of
soulless
marble
so
deadly
cold
did
she
look
the
moments
that
dragged
themselves
out
whilst
i
waited
for
her
to
speak
seemed
endless
at
length
her
words
came
in
an
awed
whisper
so
faint
that
even
in
that
stilly
night
i
could
hardly
hear
it
you
knowyou
know
my
restingplace
howwhen
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
speak
out
the
truth
i
was
in
the
crypt
of
st
sava
it
was
all
by
accident
i
was
exploring
all
around
the
castle
and
i
went
there
in
my
course
i
found
the
winding
stair
in
the
rock
behind
the
screen
and
went
down
dear
i
loved
you
well
before
that
awful
moment
but
then
even
as
the
lantern
fell
tingling
on
the
glass
my
love
multiplied
itself
with
pity
as
a
factor
she
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
when
she
spoke
there
was
a
new
tone
in
her
voice
but
were
you
not
shocked
of
course
i
was
i
answered
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
i
now
think
wisely
shocked
is
hardly
the
word
i
was
horrified
beyond
anything
that
words
can
convey
that
youyou
should
have
to
so
endure
i
did
not
like
to
return
for
i
feared
lest
my
doing
so
might
set
some
barrier
between
us
but
in
due
time
i
did
return
on
another
day
well
her
voice
was
like
sweet
music
i
had
another
shock
that
time
worse
than
before
for
you
were
not
there
then
indeed
it
was
that
i
knew
to
myself
how
dear
you
werehow
dear
you
are
to
me
whilst
i
live
youliving
or
deadshall
always
be
in
my
heart
she
breathed
hard
the
elation
in
her
eyes
made
them
outshine
the
moonlight
but
she
said
no
word
i
went
on
my
dear
i
had
come
into
the
crypt
full
of
courage
and
hope
though
i
knew
what
dreadful
sight
should
sear
my
eyes
once
again
but
we
little
know
what
may
be
in
store
for
us
no
matter
what
we
expect
i
went
out
with
a
heart
like
water
from
that
dreadful
desolation
oh
how
you
love
me
dear
cheered
by
her
words
and
even
more
by
her
tone
i
went
on
with
renewed
courage
there
was
no
halting
no
faltering
in
my
intention
now
you
and
i
my
dear
were
ordained
for
each
other
i
cannot
help
it
that
you
had
already
suffered
before
i
knew
you
it
may
be
that
there
may
be
for
you
still
suffering
that
i
may
not
prevent
endurance
that
i
may
not
shorten
but
what
a
man
can
do
is
yours
not
hell
itself
will
stop
me
if
it
be
possible
that
i
may
win
through
its
torments
with
you
in
my
arms
will
nothing
stop
you
then
her
question
was
breathed
as
softly
as
the
strain
of
an
aeolian
harp
nothing
i
said
and
i
heard
my
own
teeth
snap
together
there
was
something
speaking
within
me
stronger
than
i
had
ever
known
myself
to
be
again
came
a
query
trembling
quavering
quivering
as
though
the
issue
was
of
more
than
life
or
death
not
this
she
held
up
a
corner
of
the
shroud
and
as
she
saw
my
face
and
realized
the
answer
before
i
spoke
went
on
with
all
it
implies
not
if
it
were
wrought
of
the
cerecloths
of
the
damned
there
was
a
long
pause
her
voice
was
more
resolute
when
she
spoke
again
it
rang
moreover
there
was
in
it
a
joyous
note
as
of
one
who
feels
new
hope
but
do
you
know
what
men
say
some
of
them
that
i
am
dead
and
buried
others
that
i
am
not
only
dead
and
buried
but
that
i
am
one
of
those
unhappy
beings
that
may
not
die
the
common
death
of
man
who
live
on
a
fearful
lifeindeath
whereby
they
are
harmful
to
all
those
unhappy
undead
whom
men
call
vampireswho
live
on
the
blood
of
the
living
and
bring
eternal
damnation
as
well
as
death
with
the
poison
of
their
dreadful
kisses
i
know
what
men
say
sometimes
i
answered
but
i
know
also
what
my
own
heart
says
and
i
rather
choose
to
obey
its
calling
than
all
the
voices
of
the
living
or
the
dead
come
what
may
i
am
pledged
to
you
if
it
be
that
your
old
life
has
to
be
rewon
for
you
out
of
the
very
jaws
of
death
and
hell
i
shall
keep
the
faith
i
have
pledged
and
that
here
i
pledge
again
as
i
finished
speaking
i
sank
on
my
knees
at
her
feet
and
putting
my
arms
round
her
drew
her
close
to
me
her
tears
rained
down
on
my
face
as
she
stroked
my
hair
with
her
soft
strong
hand
and
whispered
to
me
this
is
indeed
to
be
one
what
more
holy
marriage
can
god
give
to
any
of
his
creatures
we
were
both
silent
for
a
time
i
think
i
was
the
first
to
recover
my
senses
that
i
did
so
was
manifest
by
my
asking
her
when
may
we
meet
againa
thing
i
had
never
remembered
doing
at
any
of
our
former
partings
she
answered
with
a
rising
and
falling
of
the
voice
that
was
just
above
a
whisper
as
soft
and
cooing
as
the
voice
of
a
pigeon
that
will
be
soonas
soon
as
i
can
manage
it
be
sure
my
dear
my
dear
the
last
four
words
of
endearment
she
spoke
in
a
low
but
prolonged
and
piercing
tone
which
made
me
thrill
with
delight
give
me
some
token
i
said
that
i
may
have
always
close
to
me
to
ease
my
aching
heart
till
we
meet
again
and
ever
after
for
loves
sake
her
mind
seemed
to
leap
to
understanding
and
with
a
purpose
all
her
own
stooping
for
an
instant
she
tore
off
with
swift
strong
fingers
a
fragment
of
her
shroud
this
having
kissed
it
she
handed
to
me
whispering
it
is
time
that
we
part
you
must
leave
me
now
take
this
and
keep
it
for
ever
i
shall
be
less
unhappy
in
my
terrible
loneliness
whilst
it
lasts
if
i
know
that
this
my
gift
which
for
good
or
ill
is
a
part
of
me
as
you
know
me
is
close
to
you
it
may
be
my
very
dear
that
some
day
you
may
be
glad
and
even
proud
of
this
hour
as
i
am
she
kissed
me
as
i
took
it
for
life
or
death
i
care
not
which
so
long
as
i
am
with
you
i
said
as
i
moved
off
descending
the
jacobs
ladder
i
made
my
way
down
the
rockhewn
passage
the
last
thing
i
saw
was
the
beautiful
face
of
my
lady
of
the
shroud
as
she
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
opening
her
eyes
were
like
glowing
stars
as
her
looks
followed
me
that
look
shall
never
fade
from
my
memory
after
a
few
agitating
moments
of
thought
i
half
mechanically
took
my
way
down
to
the
garden
opening
the
grille
i
entered
my
lonely
room
which
looked
all
the
more
lonely
for
the
memory
of
the
rapturous
moments
under
the
flagstaff
i
went
to
bed
as
one
in
a
dream
there
i
lay

1907
the
time
has
gone
as
quickly
as
work
can
effect
since
i
saw
my
lady
as
i
told
the
mountaineers
rooke
whom
i
had
sent
on
the
service
had
made
a
contract
for
fifty
thousand
ingismalbron
rifles
and
as
many
tons
of
ammunition
as
the
french
experts
calculated
to
be
a
full
supply
for
a
year
of
warfare
i
heard
from
him
by
our
secret
telegraph
code
that
the
order
had
been
completed
and
that
the
goods
were
already
on
the
way
the
morning
after
the
meeting
at
the
flagstaff
i
had
word
that
at
night
the
vesselone
chartered
by
rooke
for
the
purposewould
arrive
at
vissarion
during
the
night
we
were
all
expectation
i
had
always
now
in
the
castle
a
signalling
party
the
signals
being
renewed
as
fast
as
the
men
were
sufficiently
expert
to
proceed
with
their
practice
alone
or
in
groups
we
hoped
that
every
fightingman
in
the
country
would
in
time
become
an
expert
signaller
beyond
these
again
we
have
always
a
few
priests
the
church
of
the
country
is
a
militant
church
its
priests
are
soldiers
its
bishops
commanders
but
they
all
serve
wherever
the
battle
most
needs
them
naturally
they
as
men
of
brains
are
quicker
at
learning
than
the
average
mountaineers
with
the
result
that
they
learnt
the
code
and
the
signalling
almost
by
instinct
we
have
now
at
least
one
such
expert
in
each
community
of
them
and
shortly
the
priests
alone
will
be
able
to
signal
if
need
be
for
the
nation
thus
releasing
for
active
service
the
merely
fightingman
the
men
at
present
with
me
i
took
into
confidence
as
to
the
vessels
arrival
and
we
were
all
ready
for
work
when
the
man
on
the
lookout
at
the
flagstaff
sent
word
that
a
vessel
without
lights
was
creeping
in
towards
shore
we
all
assembled
on
the
rocky
edge
of
the
creek
and
saw
her
steal
up
the
creek
and
gain
the
shelter
of
the
harbour
when
this
had
been
effected
we
ran
out
the
boom
which
protects
the
opening
and
after
that
the
great
armoured
slidinggates
which
uncle
roger
had
himself
had
made
so
as
to
protect
the
harbour
in
case
of
need
we
then
came
within
and
assisted
in
warping
the
steamer
to
the
side
of
the
dock
rooke
looked
fit
and
was
full
of
fire
and
vigour
his
responsibility
and
the
mere
thought
of
warlike
action
seemed
to
have
renewed
his
youth
when
we
had
arranged
for
the
unloading
of
the
cases
of
arms
and
ammunition
i
took
rooke
into
the
room
which
we
call
my
office
where
he
gave
me
an
account
of
his
doings
he
had
not
only
secured
the
rifles
and
the
ammunition
for
them
but
he
had
purchased
from
one
of
the
small
american
republics
an
armoured
yacht
which
had
been
especially
built
for
war
service
he
grew
quite
enthusiastic
even
excited
as
he
told
me
of
her
she
is
the
last
word
in
naval
constructiona
torpedo
yacht
a
small
cruiser
with
turbines
up
to
date
oilfuelled
and
fully
armed
with
the
latest
and
most
perfect
weapons
and
explosives
of
all
kinds
the
fastest
boat
afloat
today

by
thorneycroft

by
crupp
if
she
ever
comes
into
action
it
will
be
bad
for
her
opponent
for
she
need
not
fear
to
tackle
anything
less
than
a
dreadnought
he
also
told
me
that
from
the
same
government
whose
nation
had
just
established
an
unlookedfor
peace
he
had
also
purchased
a
whole
park
of
artillery
of
the
very
latest
patterns
and
that
for
range
and
accuracy
the
guns
were
held
to
be
supreme
these
would
follow
before
long
and
with
them
their
proper
ammunition
with
a
shipload
of
the
same
to
follow
shortly
after
when
he
had
told
me
all
the
rest
of
his
news
and
handed
me
the
accounts
we
went
out
to
the
dock
to
see
the
debarkation
of
the
war
material
knowing
that
it
was
arriving
i
had
sent
word
in
the
afternoon
to
the
mountaineers
to
tell
them
to
come
and
remove
it
they
had
answered
the
call
and
it
really
seemed
to
me
that
the
whole
of
the
land
must
that
night
have
been
in
motion
they
came
as
individuals
grouping
themselves
as
they
came
within
the
defences
of
the
castle
some
had
gathered
at
fixed
points
on
the
way
they
went
secretly
and
in
silence
stealing
through
the
forests
like
ghosts
each
party
when
it
grouped
taking
the
place
of
that
which
had
gone
on
one
of
the
routes
radiating
round
vissarion
their
coming
and
going
was
more
than
ghostly
it
was
indeed
the
outward
manifestation
of
an
inward
spirita
whole
nation
dominated
by
one
common
purpose
the
men
in
the
steamer
were
nearly
all
engineers
mostly
british
well
conducted
and
to
be
depended
upon
rooke
had
picked
them
separately
and
in
the
doing
had
used
well
his
great
experience
of
both
men
and
adventurous
life
these
men
were
to
form
part
of
the
armoured
yachts
crew
when
she
should
come
into
the
mediterranean
waters
they
and
the
priests
and
fightingmen
in
the
castle
worked
well
together
and
with
a
zeal
that
was
beyond
praise
the
heavy
cases
seemed
almost
of
their
own
accord
to
leave
the
holds
so
fast
came
the
procession
of
them
along
the
gangways
from
deck
to
dockwall
it
was
a
part
of
my
design
that
the
arms
should
be
placed
in
centres
ready
for
local
distribution
in
such
a
country
as
this
without
railways
or
even
roads
the
distribution
of
war
material
in
any
quantity
is
a
great
labour
for
it
has
to
be
done
individually
or
at
least
from
centres
but
of
this
work
the
great
number
of
mountaineers
who
were
arriving
made
little
account
as
fast
as
the
ships
company
with
the
assistance
of
the
priests
and
fightingmen
placed
the
cases
on
the
quay
the
engineers
opened
them
and
laid
the
contents
ready
for
portage
the
mountaineers
seemed
to
come
in
a
continuous
stream
each
in
turn
shouldered
his
burden
and
passed
out
the
captain
of
his
section
giving
him
as
he
passed
his
instruction
where
to
go
and
in
what
route
the
method
had
been
already
prepared
in
my
office
ready
for
such
a
distribution
when
the
arms
should
arrive
and
descriptions
and
quantities
had
been
noted
by
the
captains
the
whole
affair
was
treated
by
all
as
a
matter
of
the
utmost
secrecy
hardly
a
word
was
spoken
beyond
the
necessary
directions
and
these
were
given
in
whispers
all
night
long
the
stream
of
men
went
and
came
and
towards
dawn
the
bulk
of
the
imported
material
was
lessened
by
half
on
the
following
night
the
remainder
was
removed
after
my
own
men
had
stored
in
the
castle
the
rifles
and
ammunition
reserved
for
its
defence
if
necessary
it
was
advisable
to
keep
a
reserve
supply
in
case
it
should
ever
be
required
the
following
night
rooke
went
away
secretly
in
the
chartered
vessel
he
had
to
bring
back
with
him
the
purchased
cannon
and
heavy
ammunition
which
had
been
in
the
meantime
stored
on
one
of
the
greek
islands
the
second
morning
having
had
secret
word
that
the
steamer
was
on
the
way
i
had
given
the
signal
for
the
assembling
of
the
mountaineers
a
little
after
dark
the
vessel
showing
no
light
stole
into
the
creek
the
barrier
gates
were
once
again
closed
and
when
a
sufficient
number
of
men
had
arrived
to
handle
the
guns
we
began
to
unload
the
actual
deportation
was
easy
enough
for
the
dock
had
all
necessary
appliances
quite
up
to
date
including
a
pair
of
shears
for
gunlifting
which
could
be
raised
into
position
in
a
very
short
time
the
guns
were
well
furnished
with
tackle
of
all
sorts
and
before
many
hours
had
passed
a
little
procession
of
them
disappeared
into
the
woods
in
ghostly
silence
a
number
of
men
surrounded
each
and
they
moved
as
well
as
if
properly
supplied
with
horses
in
the
meantime
and
for
a
week
after
the
arrival
of
the
guns
the
drilling
went
on
without
pause
the
gundrill
was
wonderful
in
the
arduous
work
necessary
for
it
the
great
strength
and
stamina
of
the
mountaineers
showed
out
wonderfully
they
did
not
seem
to
know
fatigue
any
more
than
they
knew
fear
for
a
week
this
went
on
till
a
perfect
discipline
and
management
was
obtained
they
did
not
practise
the
shooting
for
this
would
have
made
secrecy
impossible
it
was
reported
all
along
the
turkish
frontier
that
the
sultans
troops
were
being
massed
and
though
this
was
not
on
a
war
footing
the
movement
was
more
or
less
dangerous
the
reports
of
our
own
spies
although
vague
as
to
the
purpose
and
extent
of
the
movement
were
definite
as
to
something
being
on
foot
and
turkey
does
not
do
something
without
a
purpose
that
bodes
ill
to
someone
certainly
the
sound
of
cannon
which
is
a
farreaching
sound
would
have
given
them
warning
of
our
preparations
and
would
so
have
sadly
minimized
their
effectiveness
when
the
cannon
had
all
been
disposed
ofexcept
of
course
those
destined
for
defence
of
the
castle
or
to
be
stored

went
away
with
the
ship
and
crew
the
ship
he
was
to
return
to
the
owners
the
men
would
be
shipped
on
the
waryacht
of
whose
crew
they
would
form
a
part
the
rest
of
them
had
been
carefully
selected
by
rooke
himself
and
were
kept
in
secrecy
at
cattaro
ready
for
service
the
moment
required
they
were
all
good
men
and
quite
capable
of
whatever
work
they
might
be
set
to
so
rooke
told
me
and
he
ought
to
know
the
experience
of
his
young
days

1907
last
night
i
got
from
my
lady
a
similar
message
to
the
last
and
delivered
in
a
similar
way
this
time
however
our
meeting
was
to
be
on
the
leads
of
the
keep
i
dressed
myself
very
carefully
before
going
on
this
adventure
lest
by
any
chance
of
household
concern
any
of
the
servants
should
see
me
for
if
this
should
happen
aunt
janet
would
be
sure
to
hear
of
it
which
would
give
rise
to
endless
surmises
and
questioningsa
thing
i
was
far
from
desiring
i
confess
that
in
thinking
the
matter
over
during
the
time
i
was
making
my
hurried
preparations
i
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
any
human
body
even
though
it
be
of
the
dead
could
go
or
be
conveyed
to
such
a
place
without
some
sort
of
assistance
or
at
least
collusion
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
inmates
at
the
visit
to
the
flagstaff
circumstances
were
different
this
spot
was
actually
outside
the
castle
and
in
order
to
reach
it
i
myself
had
to
leave
the
castle
privately
and
from
the
garden
ascend
to
the
ramparts
but
here
was
no
such
possibility
the
keep
was
an
imperium
in
imperio
it
stood
within
the
castle
though
separated
from
it
and
it
had
its
own
defences
against
intrusion
the
roof
of
it
was
so
far
as
i
knew
as
little
approachable
as
the
magazine
the
difficulty
did
not
however
trouble
me
beyond
a
mere
passing
thought
in
the
joy
of
the
coming
meeting
and
the
longing
rapture
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
all
difficulties
disappeared
love
makes
its
own
faith
and
i
never
doubted
that
my
lady
would
be
waiting
for
me
at
the
place
designated
when
i
had
passed
through
the
little
arched
passages
and
up
the
doublygrated
stairways
contrived
in
the
massiveness
of
the
walls
i
let
myself
out
on
the
leads
it
was
well
that
as
yet
the
times
were
sufficiently
peaceful
not
to
necessitate
guards
or
sentries
at
all
such
points
there
in
a
dim
corner
where
the
moonlight
and
the
passing
clouds
threw
deep
shadows
i
saw
her
clothed
as
ever
in
her
shroud
why
i
know
not
i
felt
somehow
that
the
situation
was
even
more
serious
than
ever
but
i
was
steeled
to
whatever
might
come
my
mind
had
been
already
made
up
to
carry
out
my
resolve
to
win
the
woman
i
loved
i
was
ready
to
face
death
but
now
after
we
had
for
a
few
brief
moments
held
each
other
in
our
arms
i
was
willing
to
accept
deathor
more
than
death
now
more
than
before
was
she
sweet
and
dear
to
me
whatever
qualms
there
might
have
been
at
the
beginning
of
our
lovemaking
or
during
the
progress
of
it
did
not
now
exist
we
had
exchanged
vows
and
confidences
and
acknowledged
our
loves
what
then
could
there
be
of
distrust
or
even
doubt
that
the
present
might
not
set
at
naught
but
even
had
there
been
such
doubts
or
qualms
they
must
have
disappeared
in
the
ardour
of
our
mutual
embrace
i
was
by
now
mad
for
her
and
was
content
to
be
so
mad
when
she
had
breath
to
speak
after
the
strictness
of
our
embrace
she
said
i
have
come
to
warn
you
to
be
more
than
ever
careful
it
was
i
confess
a
pang
to
me
who
thought
only
of
love
to
hear
that
anything
else
should
have
been
the
initiative
power
of
her
coming
even
though
it
had
been
her
concern
for
my
own
safety
i
could
not
but
notice
the
bitter
note
of
chagrin
in
my
voice
as
i
answered
it
was
for
loves
sake
that
i
came
she
too
evidently
felt
the
undercurrent
of
pain
for
she
said
quickly
ah
dearest
i
too
came
for
loves
sake
it
is
because
i
love
you
that
i
am
so
anxious
about
you
what
would
the
worlday
or
heavenbe
to
me
without
you
there
was
such
earnest
truth
in
her
tone
that
the
sense
and
realization
of
my
own
harshness
smote
me
in
the
presence
of
such
love
as
this
even
a
lovers
selfishness
must
become
abashed
i
could
not
express
myself
in
words
so
simply
raised
her
slim
hand
in
mine
and
kissed
it
as
it
lay
warm
in
my
own
i
could
not
but
notice
as
well
as
its
fineness
its
strength
and
the
firmness
of
its
clasp
its
warmth
and
fervour
struck
into
my
heartand
my
brain
thereupon
i
poured
out
to
her
once
more
my
love
for
her
she
listening
all
afire
when
passion
had
had
its
say
the
calmer
emotions
had
opportunity
of
expression
when
i
was
satisfied
afresh
of
her
affection
i
began
to
value
her
care
for
my
safety
and
so
i
went
back
to
the
subject
her
very
insistence
based
on
personal
affection
gave
me
more
solid
ground
for
fear
in
the
moment
of
love
transports
i
had
forgotten
or
did
not
think
of
what
wonderful
power
or
knowledge
she
must
have
to
be
able
to
move
in
such
strange
ways
as
she
did
why
at
this
very
moment
she
was
within
my
own
gates
locks
and
bars
even
the
very
seal
of
death
itself
seemed
unable
to
make
for
her
a
prisonhouse
with
such
freedom
of
action
and
movement
going
when
she
would
into
secret
places
what
might
she
not
know
that
was
known
to
others
how
could
anyone
keep
secret
from
such
an
one
even
an
ill
intent
such
thoughts
such
surmises
had
often
flashed
through
my
mind
in
moments
of
excitement
rather
than
of
reflection
but
never
long
enough
to
become
fixed
into
belief
but
yet
the
consequences
the
convictions
of
them
were
with
me
though
unconsciously
though
the
thoughts
themselves
were
perhaps
forgotten
or
withered
before
development
and
you
i
asked
her
earnestly
what
about
danger
to
you
she
smiled
her
little
pearlwhite
teeth
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
as
she
spoke
there
is
no
danger
for
me
i
am
safe
i
am
the
safest
person
perhaps
the
only
safe
person
in
all
this
land
the
full
significance
of
her
words
did
not
seem
to
come
to
me
all
at
once
some
base
for
understanding
such
an
assertion
seemed
to
be
wanting
it
was
not
that
i
did
not
trust
or
believe
her
but
that
i
thought
she
might
be
mistaken
i
wanted
to
reassure
myself
so
in
my
distress
i
asked
unthinkingly
how
the
safest
what
is
your
protection
for
several
moments
that
spun
themselves
out
endlessly
she
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
the
stars
in
her
eyes
seeming
to
glow
like
fire
then
lowering
her
head
she
took
a
fold
of
her
shroud
and
held
it
up
to
me
this
the
meaning
was
complete
and
understandable
now
i
could
not
speak
at
once
for
the
wave
of
emotion
which
choked
me
i
dropped
on
my
knees
and
taking
her
in
my
arms
held
her
close
to
me
she
saw
that
i
was
moved
and
tenderly
stroked
my
hair
and
with
delicate
touch
pressed
down
my
head
on
her
bosom
as
a
mother
might
have
done
to
comfort
a
frightened
child
presently
we
got
back
to
the
realities
of
life
again
i
murmured
your
safety
your
life
your
happiness
are
allinall
to
me
when
will
you
let
them
be
my
care
she
trembled
in
my
arms
nestling
even
closer
to
me
her
own
arms
seemed
to
quiver
with
delight
as
she
said
would
you
indeed
like
me
to
be
always
with
you
to
me
it
would
be
a
happiness
unspeakable
and
to
you
what
would
it
be
i
thought
that
she
wished
to
hear
me
speak
my
love
to
her
and
that
womanlike
she
had
led
me
to
the
utterance
and
so
i
spoke
again
of
the
passion
that
now
raged
in
me
she
listening
eagerly
as
we
strained
each
other
tight
in
our
arms
at
last
there
came
a
pause
a
long
long
pause
and
our
hearts
beat
consciously
in
unison
as
we
stood
together
presently
she
said
in
a
sweet
low
intense
whisper
as
soft
as
the
sighing
of
summer
wind
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
but
oh
my
dear
you
will
have
to
first
go
through
an
ordeal
which
may
try
you
terribly
do
not
ask
me
anything
you
must
not
ask
because
i
may
not
answer
and
it
would
be
pain
to
me
to
deny
you
anything
marriage
with
such
an
one
as
i
am
has
its
own
ritual
which
may
not
be
foregone
it
may




i
broke
passionately
into
her
speaking
there
is
no
ritual
that
i
fear
so
long
as
it
be
that
it
is
for
your
good
and
your
lasting
happiness
and
if
the
end
of
it
be
that
i
may
call
you
mine
there
is
no
horror
in
life
or
death
that
i
shall
not
gladly
face
dear
i
ask
you
nothing
i
am
content
to
leave
myself
in
your
hands
you
shall
advise
me
when
the
time
comes
and
i
shall
be
satisfied
content
to
obey
content
it
is
but
a
poor
word
to
express
what
i
long
for
i
shall
shirk
nothing
which
may
come
to
me
from
this
or
any
other
world
so
long
as
it
is
to
make
you
mine
once
again
her
murmured
happiness
was
music
to
my
ears
oh
how
you
love
me
how
you
love
me
dear
dear
she
took
me
in
her
arms
and
for
a
few
seconds
we
hung
together
suddenly
she
tore
herself
apart
from
me
and
stood
drawn
up
to
the
full
height
with
a
dignity
i
cannot
describe
or
express
her
voice
had
a
new
dominance
as
with
firm
utterance
and
in
staccato
manner
she
said
rupert
sent
leger
before
we
go
a
step
further
i
must
say
something
to
you
ask
you
something
and
i
charge
you
on
your
most
sacred
honour
and
belief
to
answer
me
truly
do
you
believe
me
to
be
one
of
those
unhappy
beings
who
may
not
die
but
have
to
live
in
shameful
existence
between
earth
and
the
nether
world
and
whose
hellish
mission
is
to
destroy
body
and
soul
those
who
love
them
till
they
fall
to
their
level
you
are
a
gentleman
and
a
brave
one
i
have
found
you
fearless
answer
me
in
sternest
truth
no
matter
what
the
issue
may
be
she
stood
there
in
the
glamorous
moonlight
with
a
commanding
dignity
which
seemed
more
than
human
in
that
mystic
light
her
white
shroud
seemed
diaphanous
and
she
appeared
like
a
spirit
of
power
what
was
i
to
say
how
could
i
admit
to
such
a
being
that
i
had
actually
had
at
moments
if
not
a
belief
a
passing
doubt
it
was
a
conviction
with
me
that
if
i
spoke
wrongly
i
should
lose
her
for
ever
i
was
in
a
desperate
strait
in
such
a
case
there
is
but
one
solid
ground
which
one
may
rest
onthe
truth
i
really
felt
i
was
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
there
was
no
avoiding
the
issue
and
so
out
of
this
allembracing
allcompelling
conviction
of
truth
i
spoke
for
a
fleeting
moment
i
felt
that
my
tone
was
truculent
and
almost
hesitated
but
as
i
saw
no
anger
or
indignation
on
my
ladys
face
but
rather
an
eager
approval
i
was
reassured
a
woman
after
all
is
glad
to
see
a
man
strong
for
all
belief
in
him
must
be
based
on
that
i
shall
speak
the
truth
remember
that
i
have
no
wish
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
as
you
conjure
me
by
my
honour
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
pain
it
is
true
that
i
had
at
firstay
and
later
when
i
came
to
think
matters
over
after
you
had
gone
when
reason
came
to
the
aid
of
impressiona
passing
belief
that
you
are
a
vampire
how
can
i
fail
to
have
even
now
though
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
though
i
have
held
you
in
my
arms
and
kissed
you
on
the
mouth
a
doubt
when
all
the
evidences
seem
to
point
to
one
thing
remember
that
i
have
only
seen
you
at
night
except
that
bitter
moment
when
in
the
broad
noonday
of
the
upper
world
i
saw
you
clad
as
ever
in
a
shroud
lying
seemingly
dead
in
a
tomb
in
the
crypt
of
st
savas
church



but
let
that
pass
such
belief
as
i
have
is
all
in
you
be
you
woman
or
vampire
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
it
is
you
whom
i
love
should
it
be
that
you
areyou
are
not
woman
which
i
cannot
believe
then
it
will
be
my
glory
to
break
your
fetters
to
open
your
prison
and
set
you
free
to
that
i
consecrate
my
life
for
a
few
seconds
i
stood
silent
vibrating
with
the
passion
which
had
been
awakened
in
me
she
had
by
now
lost
the
measure
of
her
haughty
isolation
and
had
softened
into
womanhood
again
it
was
really
like
a
realization
of
the
old
theme
of
pygmalions
statue
it
was
with
rather
a
pleading
than
a
commanding
voice
that
she
said
and
shall
you
always
be
true
to
me
alwaysso
help
me
god
i
answered
and
i
felt
that
there
could
be
no
lack
of
conviction
in
my
voice
indeed
there
was
no
cause
for
such
lack
she
also
stood
for
a
little
while
stonestill
and
i
was
beginning
to
expand
to
the
rapture
which
was
in
store
for
me
when
she
should
take
me
again
in
her
arms
but
there
was
no
such
moment
of
softness
all
at
once
she
started
as
if
she
had
suddenly
wakened
from
a
dream
and
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
said
now
go
go
i
felt
the
conviction
of
necessity
to
obey
and
turned
at
once
as
i
moved
towards
the
door
by
which
i
had
entered
i
asked
when
shall
i
see
you
again
soon
came
her
answer
i
shall
let
you
know
soonwhen
and
where
oh
go
go
she
almost
pushed
me
from
her
when
i
had
passed
through
the
low
doorway
and
locked
and
barred
it
behind
me
i
felt
a
pang
that
i
should
have
had
to
shut
her
out
like
that
but
i
feared
lest
there
should
arise
some
embarrassing
suspicion
if
the
door
should
be
found
open
later
came
the
comforting
thought
that
as
she
had
got
to
the
roof
though
the
door
had
been
shut
she
would
be
able
to
get
away
by
the
same
means
she
had
evidently
knowledge
of
some
secret
way
into
the
castle
the
alternative
was
that
she
must
have
some
supernatural
quality
or
faculty
which
gave
her
strange
powers
i
did
not
wish
to
pursue
that
train
of
thought
and
so
after
an
effort
shut
it
out
from
my
mind
when
i
got
back
to
my
room
i
locked
the
door
behind
me
and
went
to
sleep
in
the
dark
i
did
not
want
light
just
thencould
not
bear
it
this
morning
i
woke
a
little
later
than
usual
with
a
kind
of
apprehension
which
i
could
not
at
once
understand
presently
however
when
my
faculties
became
fully
awake
and
in
working
order
i
realized
that
i
feared
half
expected
that
aunt
janet
would
come
to
me
in
a
worse
state
of
alarm
than
ever
apropos
of
some
new
secondsight
experience
of
more
than
usual
ferocity
but
strange
to
say
i
had
no
such
visit
later
on
in
the
morning
when
after
breakfast
we
walked
together
through
the
garden
i
asked
her
how
she
had
slept
and
if
she
had
dreamt
she
answered
me
that
she
had
slept
without
waking
and
if
she
had
had
any
dreams
they
must
have
been
pleasant
ones
for
she
did
not
remember
them
and
you
know
rupert
she
added
that
if
there
be
anything
bad
or
fearsome
or
warning
in
dreams
i
always
remember
them
later
still
when
i
was
by
myself
on
the
cliff
beyond
the
creek
i
could
not
help
commenting
on
the
absence
of
her
power
of
second
sight
on
the
occasion
surely
if
ever
there
was
a
time
when
she
might
have
had
cause
of
apprehension
it
might
well
have
been
when
i
asked
the
lady
whom
she
did
not
know
to
marry
methe
lady
of
whose
identity
i
knew
nothing
even
whose
name
i
did
not
knowwhom
i
loved
with
all
my
heart
and
soulmy
lady

the
shroud

lost
faith

sight

another
week
gone
i
have
waited
patiently
and
i
am
at
last
rewarded
by
another
letter
i
was
preparing
for
bed
a
little
while
ago
when
i
heard
the
same
mysterious
sound
at
the
door
as
on
the
last
two
occasions
i
hurried
to
the
glass
door
and
there
found
another
closefolded
letter
but
i
could
see
no
sign
of
my
lady
or
of
any
other
living
being
the
letter
which
was
without
direction
ran
as
follows
if
you
are
still
of
the
same
mind
and
feel
no
misgivings
meet
me
at
the
church
of
st
sava
beyond
the
creek
tomorrow
night
at
a
quarter
before
midnight
if
you
come
come
in
secret
and
of
course
alone
do
not
come
at
all
unless
you
are
prepared
for
a
terrible
ordeal
but
if
you
love
me
and
have
neither
doubts
nor
fears
come
come
needless
to
say
i
did
not
sleep
last
night
i
tried
to
but
without
success
it
was
no
morbid
happiness
that
kept
me
awake
no
doubting
no
fear
i
was
simply
overwhelmed
with
the
idea
of
the
coming
rapture
when
i
should
call
my
lady
my
very
very
own
in
this
sea
of
happy
expectation
all
lesser
things
were
submerged
even
sleep
which
is
an
imperative
force
with
me
failed
in
its
usual
effectiveness
and
i
lay
still
calm
content
with
the
coming
of
the
morning
however
restlessness
began
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
how
to
restrain
myself
where
to
look
for
an
anodyne
happily
the
latter
came
in
the
shape
of
rooke
who
turned
up
shortly
after
breakfast
he
had
a
satisfactory
tale
to
tell
me
of
the
armoured
yacht
which
had
lain
off
cattaro
on
the
previous
night
and
to
which
he
had
brought
his
contingent
of
crew
which
had
waited
for
her
coming
he
did
not
like
to
take
the
risk
of
going
into
any
port
with
such
a
vessel
lest
he
might
be
detained
or
otherwise
hampered
by
forms
and
had
gone
out
upon
the
open
sea
before
daylight
there
was
on
board
the
yacht
a
tiny
torpedoboat
for
which
provision
was
made
both
for
hoisting
on
deck
and
housing
there
this
last
would
run
into
the
creek
at
ten
oclock
that
evening
at
which
time
it
would
be
dark
the
yacht
would
then
run
to
near
otranto
to
which
she
would
send
a
boat
to
get
any
message
i
might
send
this
was
to
be
in
a
code
which
we
arranged
and
would
convey
instructions
as
to
what
night
and
approximate
hour
the
yacht
would
come
to
the
creek
the
day
was
well
on
before
we
had
made
certain
arrangements
for
the
future
and
not
till
then
did
i
feel
again
the
pressure
of
my
personal
restlessness
rooke
like
a
wise
commander
took
rest
whilst
he
could
well
he
knew
that
for
a
couple
of
days
and
nights
at
least
there
would
be
little
if
any
sleep
for
him
for
myself
the
habit
of
selfcontrol
stood
to
me
and
i
managed
to
get
through
the
day
somehow
without
exciting
the
attention
of
anyone
else
the
arrival
of
the
torpedoboat
and
the
departure
of
rooke
made
for
me
a
welcome
break
in
my
uneasiness
an
hour
ago
i
said
goodnight
to
aunt
janet
and
shut
myself
up
alone
here
my
watch
is
on
the
table
before
me
so
that
i
may
make
sure
of
starting
to
the
moment
i
have
allowed
myself
half
an
hour
to
reach
st
sava
my
skiff
is
waiting
moored
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
on
the
hither
side
where
the
zigzag
comes
close
to
the
water
it
is
now
ten
minutes
past
eleven
i
shall
add
the
odd
five
minutes
to
the
time
for
my
journey
so
as
to
make
safe
i
go
unarmed
and
without
a
light
i
shall
show
no
distrust
of
anyone
or
anything

1907
when
i
was
outside
the
church
i
looked
at
my
watch
in
the
bright
moonlight
and
found
i
had
one
minute
to
wait
so
i
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
and
looked
out
at
the
scene
before
me
not
a
sign
of
life
was
visible
around
me
either
on
land
or
sea
on
the
broad
plateau
on
which
the
church
stands
there
was
no
movement
of
any
kind
the
wind
which
had
been
pleasant
in
the
noontide
had
fallen
completely
and
not
a
leaf
was
stirring
i
could
see
across
the
creek
and
note
the
hard
line
where
the
battlements
of
the
castle
cut
the
sky
and
where
the
keep
towered
above
the
line
of
black
rock
which
in
the
shadow
of
the
land
made
an
ebon
frame
for
the
picture
when
i
had
seen
the
same
view
on
former
occasions
the
line
where
the
rock
rose
from
the
sea
was
a
fringe
of
white
foam
but
then
in
the
daylight
the
sea
was
sapphire
blue
now
it
was
an
expanse
of
dark
blueso
dark
as
to
seem
almost
black
it
had
not
even
the
relief
of
waves
or
ripplessimply
a
dark
cold
lifeless
expanse
with
no
gleam
of
light
anywhere
of
lighthouse
or
ship
neither
was
there
any
special
sound
to
be
heard
that
one
could
distinguishnothing
but
the
distant
hum
of
the
myriad
voices
of
the
dark
mingling
in
one
ceaseless
inarticulate
sound
it
was
well
i
had
not
time
to
dwell
on
it
or
i
might
have
reached
some
spirituallydisturbing
melancholy
let
me
say
here
that
ever
since
i
had
received
my
ladys
message
concerning
this
visit
to
st
savas
i
had
been
all
on
firenot
perhaps
at
every
moment
consciously
or
actually
so
but
always
as
it
were
prepared
to
break
out
into
flame
did
i
want
a
simile
i
might
compare
myself
to
a
wellbanked
furnace
whose
present
function
it
is
to
contain
heat
rather
than
to
create
it
whose
crust
can
at
any
moment
be
broken
by
a
force
external
to
itself
and
burst
into
raging
allcompelling
heat
no
thought
of
fear
really
entered
my
mind
every
other
emotion
there
was
coming
and
going
as
occasion
excited
or
lulled
but
not
fear
well
i
knew
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
the
purpose
which
that
secret
quest
was
to
serve
i
knew
not
only
from
my
ladys
words
but
from
the
teachings
of
my
own
senses
and
experiences
that
some
dreadful
ordeal
must
take
place
before
happiness
of
any
kind
could
be
won
and
that
ordeal
though
method
or
detail
was
unknown
to
me
i
was
prepared
to
undertake
this
was
one
of
those
occasions
when
a
man
must
undertake
blindfold
ways
that
may
lead
to
torture
or
death
or
unknown
terrors
beyond
but
then
a
manif
indeed
he
have
the
heart
of
a
mancan
always
undertake
he
can
at
least
make
the
first
step
though
it
may
turn
out
that
through
the
weakness
of
mortality
he
may
be
unable
to
fulfil
his
own
intent
or
justify
his
belief
in
his
own
powers
such
i
take
it
was
the
intellectual
attitude
of
the
brave
souls
who
of
old
faced
the
tortures
of
the
inquisition
but
though
there
was
no
immediate
fear
there
was
a
certain
doubt
for
doubt
is
one
of
those
mental
conditions
whose
calling
we
cannot
control
the
end
of
the
doubting
may
not
be
a
reality
to
us
or
be
accepted
as
a
possibility
these
things
cannot
forego
the
existence
of
the
doubt
for
even
if
a
man
says
victor
cousin
doubt
everything
else
at
least
he
cannot
doubt
that
he
doubts
the
doubt
had
at
times
been
on
me
that
my
lady
of
the
shroud
was
a
vampire
much
that
had
happened
seemed
to
point
that
way
and
here
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
unknown
when
through
the
door
which
i
was
pushing
open
my
eyes
met
only
an
expanse
of
absolute
blackness
all
doubts
which
had
ever
been
seemed
to
surround
me
in
a
legion
i
have
heard
that
when
a
man
is
drowning
there
comes
a
time
when
his
whole
life
passes
in
review
during
the
space
of
time
which
cannot
be
computed
as
even
a
part
of
a
second
so
it
was
to
me
in
the
moment
of
my
body
passing
into
the
church
in
that
moment
came
to
my
mind
all
that
had
been
which
bore
on
the
knowledge
of
my
lady
and
the
general
tendency
was
to
prove
or
convince
that
she
was
indeed
a
vampire
much
that
had
happened
or
become
known
to
me
seemed
to
justify
the
resolving
of
doubt
into
belief
even
my
own
reading
of
the
books
in
aunt
janets
little
library
and
the
dear
ladys
comments
on
them
mingled
with
her
own
uncanny
beliefs
left
little
opening
for
doubt
my
having
to
help
my
lady
over
the
threshold
of
my
house
on
her
first
entry
was
in
accord
with
vampire
tradition
so
too
her
flying
at
cockcrow
from
the
warmth
in
which
she
revelled
on
that
strange
first
night
of
our
meeting
so
too
her
swift
departure
at
midnight
on
the
second
into
the
same
category
came
the
facts
of
her
constant
wearing
of
her
shroud
even
her
pledging
herself
and
me
also
on
the
fragment
torn
from
it
which
she
had
given
to
me
as
a
souvenir
her
lying
still
in
the
glasscovered
tomb
her
coming
alone
to
the
most
secret
places
in
a
fortified
castle
where
every
aperture
was
secured
by
unopened
locks
and
bolts
her
very
movements
though
all
of
grace
as
she
flitted
noiselessly
through
the
gloom
of
night
all
these
things
and
a
thousand
others
of
lesser
import
seemed
for
the
moment
to
have
consolidated
an
initial
belief
but
then
came
the
supreme
recollections
of
how
she
had
lain
in
my
arms
of
her
kisses
on
my
lips
of
the
beating
of
her
heart
against
my
own
of
her
sweet
words
of
belief
and
faith
breathed
in
my
ear
in
intoxicating
whispers
of



i
paused
no
i
could
not
accept
belief
as
to
her
being
other
than
a
living
woman
of
soul
and
sense
of
flesh
and
blood
of
all
the
sweet
and
passionate
instincts
of
true
and
perfect
womanhood
and
so
in
spite
of
allin
spite
of
all
beliefs
fixed
or
transitory
with
a
mind
whirling
amid
contesting
forces
and
compelling
beliefsi
stepped
into
the
church
overwhelmed
with
that
most
receptive
of
atmospheresdoubt
in
one
thing
only
was
i
fixed
here
at
least
was
no
doubt
or
misgiving
whatever
i
intended
to
go
through
what
i
had
undertaken
moreover
i
felt
that
i
was
strong
enough
to
carry
out
my
intention
whatever
might
be
of
the
unknownhowever
horrible
however
terrible
when
i
had
entered
the
church
and
closed
the
heavy
door
behind
me
the
sense
of
darkness
and
loneliness
in
all
their
horror
enfolded
me
round
the
great
church
seemed
a
living
mystery
and
served
as
an
almost
terrible
background
to
thoughts
and
remembrances
of
unutterable
gloom
my
adventurous
life
has
had
its
own
schooling
to
endurance
and
upholding
ones
courage
in
trying
times
but
it
has
its
contra
in
fulness
of
memory
i
felt
my
way
forward
with
both
hands
and
feet
every
second
seemed
as
if
it
had
brought
me
at
last
to
a
darkness
which
was
actually
tangible
all
at
once
and
with
no
heed
of
sequence
or
order
i
was
conscious
of
all
around
me
the
knowledge
or
perception
of
whichor
even
speculation
on
the
subjecthad
never
entered
my
mind
they
furnished
the
darkness
with
which
i
was
encompassed
with
all
the
crowded
phases
of
a
dream
i
knew
that
all
around
me
were
memorials
of
the
deadthat
in
the
crypt
deepwrought
in
the
rock
below
my
feet
lay
the
dead
themselves
some
of
them
perhapsone
of
them
i
knewhad
even
passed
the
grim
portals
of
time
unknown
and
had
by
some
mysterious
power
or
agency
come
back
again
to
material
earth
there
was
no
restingplace
for
thought
when
i
knew
that
the
very
air
which
i
breathed
might
be
full
of
denizens
of
the
spiritworld
in
that
impenetrable
blackness
was
a
world
of
imagining
whose
possibilities
of
horror
were
endless
i
almost
fancied
that
i
could
see
with
mortal
eyes
down
through
that
rocky
floor
to
where
in
the
lonely
crypt
lay
in
her
tomb
of
massive
stone
and
under
that
bewildering
coverlet
of
glass
the
woman
whom
i
love
i
could
see
her
beautiful
face
her
long
black
lashes
her
sweet
mouthwhich
i
had
kissedrelaxed
in
the
sleep
of
death
i
could
note
the
voluminous
shrouda
piece
of
which
as
a
precious
souvenir
lay
even
then
so
close
to
my
heartthe
snowy
woollen
coverlet
wrought
over
in
gold
with
sprigs
of
pine
the
soft
dent
in
the
cushion
on
which
her
head
must
for
so
long
have
lain
i
could
see
myselfwithin
my
eyes
the
memory
of
that
first
visitcoming
once
again
with
glad
step
to
renew
that
dear
sightdear
though
it
scorched
my
eyes
and
harrowed
my
heartand
finding
the
greater
sorrow
the
greater
desolation
of
the
empty
tomb
there
i
felt
that
i
must
think
no
more
of
that
lest
the
thought
should
unnerve
me
when
i
should
most
want
all
my
courage
that
way
madness
lay
the
darkness
had
already
sufficient
terrors
of
its
own
without
bringing
to
it
such
grim
remembrances
and
imaginings



and
i
had
yet
to
go
through
some
ordeal
which
even
to
her
who
had
passed
and
repassed
the
portals
of
death
was
full
of
fear
it
was
a
merciful
relief
to
me
when
in
groping
my
way
forwards
through
the
darkness
i
struck
against
some
portion
of
the
furnishing
of
the
church
fortunately
i
was
all
strung
up
to
tension
else
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
control
instinctively
as
i
did
the
shriek
which
was
rising
to
my
lips
i
would
have
given
anything
to
have
been
able
to
light
even
a
match
a
single
second
of
light
would
i
felt
have
made
me
my
own
man
again
but
i
knew
that
this
would
be
against
the
implied
condition
of
my
being
there
at
all
and
might
have
had
disastrous
consequences
to
her
whom
i
had
come
to
save
it
might
even
frustrate
my
scheme
and
altogether
destroy
my
opportunity
at
that
moment
it
was
borne
upon
me
more
strongly
than
ever
that
this
was
not
a
mere
fight
for
myself
or
my
own
selfish
purposesnot
merely
an
adventure
or
a
struggle
for
only
life
and
death
against
unknown
difficulties
and
dangers
it
was
a
fight
on
behalf
of
her
i
loved
not
merely
for
her
life
but
perhaps
even
for
her
soul
and
yet
this
very
thinkingunderstandingcreated
a
new
form
of
terror
for
in
that
grim
shrouding
darkness
came
memories
of
other
moments
of
terrible
stress
of
wild
mystic
rites
held
in
the
deep
gloom
of
african
forests
when
amid
scenes
of
revolting
horror
obi
and
the
devils
of
his
kind
seemed
to
reveal
themselves
to
reckless
worshippers
surfeited
with
horror
whose
lives
counted
for
naught
when
even
human
sacrifice
was
an
episode
and
the
reek
of
old
deviltries
and
recent
carnage
tainted
the
air
till
even
i
who
was
at
the
risk
of
my
life
a
privileged
spectator
who
had
come
through
dangers
without
end
to
behold
the
scene
rose
and
fled
in
horror
of
scenes
of
mystery
enacted
in
rockcut
temples
beyond
the
himalayas
whose
fanatic
priests
cold
as
death
and
as
remorseless
in
the
reaction
of
their
phrenzy
of
passion
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
then
sank
into
marble
quiet
as
with
inner
eyes
they
beheld
the
visions
of
the
hellish
powers
which
they
had
invoked
of
wild
fantastic
dances
of
the
devilworshippers
of
madagascar
where
even
the
very
semblance
of
humanity
disappeared
in
the
fantastic
excesses
of
their
orgies
of
strange
doings
of
gloom
and
mystery
in
the
rockperched
monasteries
of
thibet
of
awful
sacrifices
all
to
mystic
ends
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
cathay
of
weird
movements
with
masses
of
poisonous
snakes
by
the
medicinemen
of
the
zuni
and
mochi
indians
in
the
far
southwest
of
the
rockies
beyond
the
great
plains
of
secret
gatherings
in
vast
temples
of
old
mexico
and
by
dim
altars
of
forgotten
cities
in
the
heart
of
great
forests
in
south
america
of
rites
of
inconceivable
horror
in
the
fastnesses
of
patagonia
of



here
i
once
more
pulled
myself
up
such
thoughts
were
no
kind
of
proper
preparation
for
what
i
might
have
to
endure
my
work
that
night
was
to
be
based
on
love
on
hope
on
selfsacrifice
for
the
woman
who
in
all
the
world
was
the
closest
to
my
heart
whose
future
i
was
to
share
whether
that
sharing
might
lead
me
to
hell
or
heaven
the
hand
which
undertook
such
a
task
must
have
no
trembling
still
those
horrible
memories
had
i
am
bound
to
say
a
useful
part
in
my
preparation
for
the
ordeal
they
were
of
fact
which
i
had
seen
of
which
i
had
myself
been
in
part
a
sharer
and
which
i
had
survived
with
such
experiences
behind
me
could
there
be
aught
before
me
more
dreadful



moreover
if
the
coming
ordeal
was
of
supernatural
or
superhuman
order
could
it
transcend
in
living
horror
the
vilest
and
most
desperate
acts
of
the
basest
men



with
renewed
courage
i
felt
my
way
before
me
till
my
sense
of
touch
told
me
that
i
was
at
the
screen
behind
which
lay
the
stair
to
the
crypt
there
i
waited
silent
still
my
own
part
was
done
so
far
as
i
knew
how
to
do
it
beyond
this
what
was
to
come
was
so
far
as
i
knew
beyond
my
own
control
i
had
done
what
i
could
the
rest
must
come
from
others
i
had
exactly
obeyed
my
instructions
fulfilled
my
warranty
to
the
utmost
in
my
knowledge
and
power
there
was
therefore
left
for
me
in
the
present
nothing
but
to
wait
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
absolute
darkness
that
it
creates
its
own
reaction
the
eye
wearied
of
the
blackness
begins
to
imagine
forms
of
light
how
far
this
is
effected
by
imagination
pure
and
simple
i
know
not
it
may
be
that
nerves
have
their
own
senses
that
bring
thought
to
the
depository
common
to
all
the
human
functions
but
whatever
may
be
the
mechanism
or
the
objective
the
darkness
seems
to
people
itself
with
luminous
entities
so
was
it
with
me
as
i
stood
lonely
in
the
dark
silent
church
here
and
there
seemed
to
flash
tiny
points
of
light
in
the
same
way
the
silence
began
to
be
broken
now
and
again
by
strange
muffled
soundsthe
suggestion
of
sounds
rather
than
actual
vibrations
these
were
all
at
first
of
the
minor
importance
of
movementrustlings
creakings
faint
stirrings
fainter
breathings
presently
when
i
had
somewhat
recovered
from
the
sort
of
hypnotic
trance
to
which
the
darkness
and
stillness
had
during
the
time
of
waiting
reduced
me
i
looked
around
in
wonder
the
phantoms
of
light
and
sound
seemed
to
have
become
real
there
were
most
certainly
actual
little
points
of
light
in
placesnot
enough
to
see
details
by
but
quite
sufficient
to
relieve
the
utter
gloom
i
thoughtthough
it
may
have
been
a
mingling
of
recollection
and
imaginationthat
i
could
distinguish
the
outlines
of
the
church
certainly
the
great
altarscreen
was
dimly
visible
instinctively
i
looked
upand
thrilled
there
hung
high
above
me
was
surely
enough
a
great
greek
cross
outlined
by
tiny
points
of
light
i
lost
myself
in
wonder
and
stood
still
in
a
purely
receptive
mood
unantagonistic
to
aught
willing
for
whatever
might
come
ready
for
all
things
in
rather
a
negative
than
a
positive
mooda
mood
which
has
an
aspect
of
spiritual
meekness
this
is
the
true
spirit
of
the
neophyte
and
though
i
did
not
think
of
it
at
the
time
the
proper
attitude
for
what
is
called
by
the
church
in
whose
temple
i
stood
a
neonymph
as
the
light
grew
a
little
in
power
though
never
increasing
enough
for
distinctness
i
saw
dimly
before
me
a
table
on
which
rested
a
great
open
book
whereon
were
laid
two
ringsone
of
sliver
the
other
of
goldand
two
crowns
wrought
of
flowers
bound
at
the
joining
of
their
stems
with
tissueone
of
gold
the
other
of
silver
i
do
not
know
much
of
the
ritual
of
the
old
greek
church
which
is
the
religion
of
the
blue
mountains
but
the
things
which
i
saw
before
me
could
be
none
other
than
enlightening
symbols
instinctively
i
knew
that
i
had
been
brought
hither
though
in
this
grim
way
to
be
married
the
very
idea
of
it
thrilled
me
to
the
hearts
core
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
stay
quite
still
and
not
show
surprise
at
anything
that
might
happen
but
be
sure
i
was
all
eyes
and
ears
i
peered
anxiously
around
me
in
every
direction
but
i
could
see
no
sign
of
her
whom
i
had
come
to
meet
incidentally
however
i
noticed
that
in
the
lighting
such
as
it
was
there
was
no
flame
no
living
light
whatever
light
there
was
came
muffled
as
though
through
some
green
translucent
stone
the
whole
effect
was
terribly
weird
and
disconcerting
presently
i
started
as
seemingly
out
of
the
darkness
beside
me
a
mans
hand
stretched
out
and
took
mine
turning
i
found
close
to
me
a
tall
man
with
shining
black
eyes
and
long
black
hair
and
beard
he
was
clad
in
some
kind
of
gorgeous
robe
of
cloth
of
gold
rich
with
variety
of
adornment
his
head
was
covered
with
a
high
overhanging
hat
draped
closely
with
a
black
scarf
the
ends
of
which
formed
a
long
hanging
veil
on
either
side
these
veils
falling
over
the
magnificent
robes
of
cloth
of
gold
had
an
extraordinarily
solemn
effect
i
yielded
myself
to
the
guiding
hand
and
shortly
found
myself
so
far
as
i
could
see
at
one
side
of
the
sanctuary
in
the
floor
close
to
my
feet
was
a
yawning
chasm
into
which
from
so
high
over
my
head
that
in
the
uncertain
light
i
could
not
distinguish
its
origin
hung
a
chain
at
the
sight
a
strange
wave
of
memory
swept
over
me
i
could
not
but
remember
the
chain
which
hung
over
the
glasscovered
tomb
in
the
crypt
and
i
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
the
grim
chasm
in
the
floor
of
the
sanctuary
was
but
the
other
side
of
the
opening
in
the
roof
of
the
crypt
from
which
the
chain
over
the
sarcophagus
depended
there
was
a
creaking
soundthe
groaning
of
a
windlass
and
the
clanking
of
a
chain
there
was
heavy
breathing
close
to
me
somewhere
i
was
so
intent
on
what
was
going
on
that
i
did
not
see
that
one
by
one
seeming
to
grow
out
of
the
surrounding
darkness
several
black
figures
in
monkish
garb
appeared
with
the
silence
of
ghosts
their
faces
were
shrouded
in
black
cowls
wherein
were
holes
through
which
i
could
see
dark
gleaming
eyes
my
guide
held
me
tightly
by
the
hand
this
gave
me
a
feeling
of
security
in
the
touch
which
helped
to
retain
within
my
breast
some
semblance
of
calm
the
strain
of
the
creaking
windlass
and
the
clanking
chain
continued
for
so
long
that
the
suspense
became
almost
unendurable
at
last
there
came
into
sight
an
iron
ring
from
which
as
a
centre
depended
four
lesser
chains
spreading
wide
in
a
few
seconds
more
i
could
see
that
these
were
fixed
to
the
corners
of
the
great
stone
tomb
with
the
covering
of
glass
which
was
being
dragged
upward
as
it
arose
it
filled
closely
the
whole
aperture
when
its
bottom
had
reached
the
level
of
the
floor
it
stopped
and
remained
rigid
there
was
no
room
for
oscillation
it
was
at
once
surrounded
by
a
number
of
black
figures
who
raised
the
glass
covering
and
bore
it
away
into
the
darkness
then
there
stepped
forward
a
very
tall
man
blackbearded
and
with
headgear
like
my
guide
but
made
in
triple
tiers
he
also
was
gorgeously
arrayed
in
flowing
robes
of
cloth
of
gold
richly
embroidered
he
raised
his
hand
and
forthwith
eight
other
blackclad
figures
stepped
forward
and
bending
over
the
stone
coffin
raised
from
it
the
rigid
form
of
my
lady
still
clad
in
her
shroud
and
laid
it
gently
on
the
floor
of
the
sanctuary
i
felt
it
a
grace
that
at
that
instant
the
dim
lights
seemed
to
grow
less
and
finally
to
disappearall
save
the
tiny
points
that
marked
the
outline
of
the
great
cross
high
overhead
these
only
gave
light
enough
to
accentuate
the
gloom
the
hand
that
held
mine
now
released
it
and
with
a
sigh
i
realized
that
i
was
alone
after
a
few
moments
more
of
the
groaning
of
the
winch
and
clanking
of
the
chain
there
was
a
sharp
sound
of
stone
meeting
stone
then
there
was
silence
i
listened
acutely
but
could
not
hear
near
me
the
slightest
sound
even
the
cautious
restrained
breathing
around
me
of
which
up
to
then
i
had
been
conscious
had
ceased
not
knowing
in
the
helplessness
of
my
ignorance
what
i
should
do
i
remained
as
i
was
still
and
silent
for
a
time
that
seemed
endless
at
last
overcome
by
some
emotion
which
i
could
not
at
the
moment
understand
i
slowly
sank
to
my
knees
and
bowed
my
head
covering
my
face
with
my
hands
i
tried
to
recall
the
prayers
of
my
youth
it
was
not
i
am
certain
that
fear
in
any
form
had
come
upon
me
or
that
i
hesitated
or
faltered
in
my
intention
that
much
i
know
now
i
knew
it
even
then
it
was
i
believe
that
the
prolonged
impressive
gloom
and
mystery
had
at
last
touched
me
to
the
quick
the
bending
of
the
knees
was
but
symbolical
of
the
bowing
of
the
spirit
to
a
higher
power
when
i
had
realized
that
much
i
felt
more
content
than
i
had
done
since
i
had
entered
the
church
and
with
the
renewed
consciousness
of
courage
took
my
hands
from
my
face
and
lifted
again
my
bowed
head
impulsively
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
stood
erectwaiting
all
seemed
to
have
changed
since
i
had
dropped
on
my
knees
the
points
of
light
about
time
church
which
had
been
eclipsed
had
come
again
and
were
growing
in
power
to
a
partial
revealing
of
the
dim
expanse
before
me
was
the
table
with
the
open
book
on
which
were
laid
the
gold
and
silver
rings
and
the
two
crowns
of
flowers
there
were
also
two
tall
candles
with
tiniest
flames
of
bluethe
only
living
light
to
be
seen
out
of
the
darkness
stepped
the
same
tall
figure
in
the
gorgeous
robes
and
the
triple
hat
he
led
by
the
hand
my
lady
still
clad
in
her
shroud
but
over
it
descending
from
the
crown
of
her
head
was
a
veil
of
very
old
and
magnificent
lace
of
astonishing
fineness
even
in
that
dim
light
i
could
note
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
fabric
the
veil
was
fastened
with
a
bunch
of
tiny
sprays
of
orangeblossom
mingled
with
cypress
and
laurela
strange
combination
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
great
bouquet
of
the
same
its
sweet
intoxicating
odour
floated
up
to
my
nostrils
it
and
the
sentiment
which
its
very
presence
evoked
made
me
quiver
yielding
to
the
guiding
of
the
hand
which
held
hers
she
stood
at
my
left
side
before
the
table
her
guide
then
took
his
place
behind
her
at
either
end
of
the
table
to
right
and
left
of
us
stood
a
longbearded
priest
in
splendid
robes
and
wearing
the
hat
with
depending
veil
of
black
one
of
them
who
seemed
to
be
the
more
important
of
the
two
and
took
the
initiative
signed
to
us
to
put
our
right
hands
on
the
open
book
my
lady
of
course
understood
the
ritual
and
knew
the
words
which
the
priest
was
speaking
and
of
her
own
accord
put
out
her
hand
my
guide
at
the
same
moment
directed
my
hand
to
the
same
end
it
thrilled
me
to
touch
my
ladys
hand
even
under
such
mysterious
conditions
after
the
priest
had
signed
us
each
thrice
on
the
forehead
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
gave
to
each
of
us
a
tiny
lighted
taper
brought
to
him
for
the
purpose
the
lights
were
welcome
not
so
much
for
the
solace
of
the
added
light
great
as
that
was
but
because
it
allowed
us
to
see
a
little
more
of
each
others
faces
it
was
rapture
to
me
to
see
the
face
of
my
bride
and
from
the
expression
of
her
face
i
was
assured
that
she
felt
as
i
did
it
gave
me
an
inexpressible
pleasure
when
as
her
eyes
rested
on
me
there
grew
a
faint
blush
over
the
grey
pallor
of
her
cheeks
the
priest
then
put
in
solemn
voice
to
each
of
us
in
turn
beginning
with
me
the
questions
of
consent
which
are
common
to
all
such
rituals
i
answered
as
well
as
i
could
following
the
murmured
words
of
my
guide
my
lady
answered
out
proudly
in
a
voice
which
though
given
softly
seemed
to
ring
it
was
a
concerneven
a
griefto
me
that
i
could
not
in
the
priests
questioning
catch
her
name
of
which
strangely
enoughi
was
ignorant
but
as
i
did
not
know
the
language
and
as
the
phrases
were
not
in
accord
literally
with
our
own
ritual
i
could
not
make
out
which
word
was
the
name
after
some
prayers
and
blessings
rhythmically
spoken
or
sung
by
an
invisible
choir
the
priest
took
the
rings
from
the
open
book
and
after
signing
my
forehead
thrice
with
the
gold
one
as
he
repeated
the
blessing
in
each
case
placed
it
on
my
right
hand
then
he
gave
my
lady
the
silver
one
with
the
same
ritual
thrice
repeated
i
suppose
it
was
the
blessing
which
is
the
effective
point
in
making
two
into
one
after
this
those
who
stood
behind
us
exchanged
our
rings
thrice
taking
them
from
one
finger
and
placing
them
on
the
other
so
that
at
the
end
my
wife
wore
the
gold
ring
and
i
the
silver
one
then
came
a
chant
during
which
the
priest
swung
the
censer
himself
and
my
wife
and
i
held
our
tapers
after
that
he
blessed
us
the
responses
coming
from
the
voices
of
the
unseen
singers
in
the
darkness
after
a
long
ritual
of
prayer
and
blessing
sung
in
triplicate
the
priest
took
the
crowns
of
flowers
and
put
one
on
the
head
of
each
crowning
me
first
and
with
the
crown
tied
with
gold
then
he
signed
and
blessed
us
each
thrice
the
guides
who
stood
behind
us
exchanged
our
crowns
thrice
as
they
had
exchanged
the
rings
so
that
at
the
last
as
i
was
glad
to
see
my
wife
wore
the
crown
of
gold
and
i
that
of
silver
then
there
came
if
it
is
possible
to
describe
such
a
thing
a
hush
over
even
that
stillness
as
though
some
form
of
added
solemnity
were
to
be
gone
through
i
was
not
surprised
therefore
when
the
priest
took
in
his
hands
the
great
golden
chalice
kneeling
my
wife
and
i
partook
together
thrice
when
we
had
risen
from
our
knees
and
stood
for
a
little
while
the
priest
took
my
left
hand
in
his
right
and
i
by
direction
of
my
guide
gave
my
right
hand
to
my
wife
and
so
in
a
line
the
priest
leading
we
circled
round
the
table
in
rhythmic
measure
those
who
supported
us
moved
behind
us
holding
the
crowns
over
our
heads
and
replacing
them
when
we
stopped
after
a
hymn
sung
through
the
darkness
the
priest
took
off
our
crowns
this
was
evidently
the
conclusion
of
the
ritual
for
the
priest
placed
us
in
each
others
arms
to
embrace
each
other
then
he
blessed
us
who
were
now
man
and
wife
the
lights
went
out
at
once
some
as
if
extinguished
others
slowly
fading
down
to
blackness
left
in
the
dark
my
wife
and
i
sought
each
others
arms
again
and
stood
together
for
a
few
moments
heart
to
heart
tightly
clasping
each
other
and
kissed
each
other
fervently
instinctively
we
turned
to
the
door
of
the
church
which
was
slightly
open
so
that
we
could
see
the
moonlight
stealing
in
through
the
aperture
with
even
steps
she
holding
me
tightly
by
the
left
armwhich
is
the
wifes
arm
we
passed
through
the
old
church
and
out
into
the
free
air
despite
all
that
the
gloom
had
brought
me
it
was
sweet
to
be
in
the
open
air
and
togetherthis
quite
apart
from
our
new
relations
to
each
other
the
moon
rode
high
and
the
full
light
coming
after
the
dimness
or
darkness
in
the
church
seemed
as
bright
as
day
i
could
now
for
the
first
time
see
my
wifes
face
properly
the
glamour
of
the
moonlight
may
have
served
to
enhance
its
ethereal
beauty
but
neither
moonlight
nor
sunlight
could
do
justice
to
that
beauty
in
its
living
human
splendour
as
i
gloried
in
her
starry
eyes
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
when
for
a
moment
my
eyes
roving
round
for
the
purpose
of
protection
caught
sight
of
her
whole
figure
there
was
a
pang
to
my
heart
the
brilliant
moonlight
showed
every
detail
in
terrible
effect
and
i
could
see
that
she
wore
only
her
shroud
in
the
moment
of
darkness
after
the
last
benediction
before
she
returned
to
my
arms
she
must
have
removed
her
bridal
veil
this
may
of
course
have
been
in
accordance
with
the
established
ritual
of
her
church
but
all
the
same
my
heart
was
sore
the
glamour
of
calling
her
my
very
own
was
somewhat
obscured
by
the
bridal
adornment
being
shorn
but
it
made
no
difference
in
her
sweetness
to
me
together
we
went
along
the
path
through
the
wood
she
keeping
equal
step
with
me
in
wifely
way
when
we
had
come
through
the
trees
near
enough
to
see
the
roof
of
the
castle
now
gilded
with
the
moonlight
she
stopped
and
looking
at
me
with
eyes
full
of
love
said
here
i
must
leave
you
what
i
was
all
aghast
and
i
felt
that
my
chagrin
was
expressed
in
the
tone
of
horrified
surprise
in
my
voice
she
went
on
quickly
alas
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
go
fartherat
present
but
what
is
to
prevent
you
i
queried
you
are
now
my
wife
this
is
our
weddingnight
and
surely
your
place
is
with
me
the
wail
in
her
voice
as
she
answered
touched
me
to
the
quick
oh
i
know
i
know
there
is
no
dearer
wish
in

heartthere

held
out
her
hands
appealingly
the
moonlight
falling
through
the
thinning
forest
showed
her
white
cerements
then
the
recollection
of
all
she
must
have
sufferedthe
awful
loneliness
in
that
grim
tomb
in
the
crypt
the
despairing
agony
of
one
who
is
helpless
against
the
unknownswept
over
me
in
a
wave
of
pity
what
could
i
do
but
save
her
from
further
pain
and
this
could
only
be
by
showing
her
my
faith
and
trust
if
she
was
to
go
back
to
that
dreadful
charnelhouse
she
would
at
least
take
with
her
the
remembrance
that
one
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
lovedto
whom
she
had
been
lately
bound
in
the
mystery
of
marriagetrusted
her
to
the
full
i
loved
her
more
than
myselfmore
than
my
own
soul
and
i
was
moved
by
pity
so
great
that
all
possible
selfishness
was
merged
in
its
depths
i
bowed
my
head
before
hermy
lady
and
my
wifeas
i
said
so
be
it
my
beloved
i
trust
you
to
the
full
even
as
you
trust
me
and
that
has
been
proven
this
night
even
to
my
own
doubting
heart
i
shall
wait
and
as
i
know
you
wish
it
i
shall
wait
as
patiently
as
i
can
but
till
you
come
to
me
for
good
and
all
let
me
see
you
or
hear
from
you
when
you
can
the
time
dear
wife
must
go
heavily
with
me
as
i
think
of
you
suffering
and
lonely
so
be
good
to
me
and
let
not
too
long
a
time
elapse
between
my
glimpses
of
hope
and
sweetheart
when
you
do
come
to
me
it
shall
be

was
something
in

intonation
of
the

sentencei
felt
its
sincerity

implied
yearning
for
a
promise
that
made
her
beautiful
eyes
swim
the
glorious
stars
in
them
were
blurred
as
she
answered
with
a
fervour
which
seemed
to
me
as
more
than
earthly
for
ever
i
swear
it
with
one
long
kiss
and
a
straining
in

left
me
tingling
for
long
after

parted

stood
and
watched
her
as
her
white
figure
gliding
through
the
deepening
gloom
faded
as
the
forest
thickened
it
surely
was
no
optical
delusion
or
a
phantom
of
the
mind
that
her
shrouded
arm
was
raised

farewell

1907
there
is
no
anodyne
but
work
to
pain
of
the
heart
and
my
pain
is
all
of
the
heart
i
sometimes
feel
that
it
is
rather
hard
that
with
so
much
to
make
me
happy
i
cannot
know
happiness
how
can
i
be
happy
when
my
wife
whom
i
fondly
love
and
who
i
know
loves
me
is
suffering
in
horror
and
loneliness
of
a
kind
which
is
almost
beyond
human
belief
however
what
is
my
loss
is
my
countrys
gain
for
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
is
my
country
now
despite
the
fact
that
i
am
still
a
loyal
subject
of
good
king
edward
uncle
roger
took
care
of
that
when
he
said
i
should
have
the
consent
of
the
privy
council
before
i
might
be
naturalized
anywhere
else
when
i
got
home
yesterday
morning
i
naturally
could
not
sleep
the
events
of
the
night
and
the
bitter
disappointment
that
followed
my
exciting
joy
made
such
a
thing
impossible
when
i
drew
the
curtain
over
the
window
the
reflection
of
the
sunrise
was
just
beginning
to
tinge
the
highsailing
clouds
in
front
of
me
i
laid
down
and
tried
to
rest
but
without
avail
however
i
schooled
myself
to
lie
still
and
at
last
if
i
did
not
sleep
was
at
least
quiescent
disturbed
by
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
i
sprang
up
at
once
and
threw
on
a
dressing
gown
outside
when
i
opened
the
door
was
aunt
janet
she
was
holding
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
for
though
it
was
getting
light
in
the
open
the
passages
were
still
dark
when
she
saw
me
she
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
and
asked
if
she
might
come
in
whilst
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
in
her
oldtime
way
she
said
in
a
hushed
voice
oh
laddie
laddie
i
trust
yer
burden
is
no
too
heavy
to
bear
my
burden
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
aunt
janet
i
said
in
reply
i
did
not
wish
to
commit
myself
by
a
definite
answer
for
it
was
evident
that
she
had
been
dreaming
or
second
sighting
again
she
replied
with
the
grim
seriousness
usual
to
her
when
she
touched
on
occult
matters
i
saw
your
hairt
bleeding
laddie
i
kent
it
was
yours
though
how
i
kent
it
i
dont
know
it
lay
on
a
stone
floor
in
the
dark
save
for
a
dim
blue
light
such
as
corpselights
are
on
it
was
placed
a
great
book
and
close
around
were
scattered
many
strange
things
amongst
them
two
crowns
o
flowersthe
one
bound
wi
silver
the
other
wi
gold
there
was
also
a
golden
cup
like
a
chalice
oerturned
the
red
wine
trickled
from
it
an
mingled
wi
yer
hairts
bluid
for
on
the
great
book
was
some
vast
dim
weight
wrapped
up
in
black
and
on
it
stepped
in
turn
many
men
all
swathed
in
black
an
as
the
weight
of
each
came
on
it
the
bluid
gushed
out
afresh
and
oh
yer
puir
hairt
my
laddie
was
quick
and
leaping
so
that
at
every
beat
it
raised
the
blackclad
weight
an
yet
that
was
not
all
for
hard
by
stood
a
tall
imperial
shape
o
a
woman
all
arrayed
in
white
wi
a
great
veil
o
finest
lace
worn
oer
a
shrood
an
she
was
whiter
than
the
snow
an
fairer
than
the
morn
for
beauty
though
a
dark
woman
she
was
wi
hair
like
the
raven
an
eyes
black
as
the
sea
at
nicht
an
there
was
stars
in
them
an
at
each
beat
o
yer
puir
bleeding
hairt
she
wrung
her
white
hands
an
the
manin
o
her
sweet
voice
rent
my
hairt
in
twain
oh
laddie
laddie
what
does
it
mean
i
managed
to
murmur
im
sure
i
dont
know
aunt
janet
i
suppose
it
was
all
a
dream
a
dream
it
was
my
dear
a

or
a
veesion
whilka

for
a

suddenly
she
said
in
a
different
voice
laddie
hae
ye
been
fause
to
any
lassie
im
no
blamin
ye
for
ye

are
different
frae
us
women
an
yer
regard
on
recht
and
wrang
differs
from
oors
but
oh
laddie
a
womans
tears
fa
heavy
when
her
hairt
is
for
sair
wi
the
yieldin
to

tis
a
heavy
burden
for
ony
man
to
carry
wi
him
as
he
goes
an
may
well
cause
pain
to
ithers
that
he
fain
would
spare
she
stopped
and
in
dead
silence
waited
for
me
to
speak
i
thought
it
would
be
best
to
set
her
poor
loving
heart
at
rest
and
as
i
could
not
divulge
my
special
secret
spoke
in
general
terms
aunt
janet
i
am
a
man
and
have
led
a
mans
life
such
as
it
is
but
i
can
tell
you
who
have
always
loved
me
and
taught
me
to
be
true
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
woman
who
must
weep
for
any
falsity
of
mine
if
close
there
be
any
who
sleeping
or
waking
in
dreams
or
visions
or
in
reality
weeps
because
of
me
it
is
surely
not
for
my
doing
but
because
of
something
outside
me
it
may
be
that
her
heart
is
sore
because
i
must
suffer
as
all
men
must
in
some
degree
but
she
does
not
weep
for
or
through
any
act
of
mine
she
sighed
happily
at
my
assurance
and
looked
up
through
her
tears
for
she
was
much
moved
and
after
tenderly
kissing
my
forehead
and
blessing
me
stole
away
she
was
more
sweet
and
tender
than
i
have
words
to
say
and
the
only
regret
that
i
have
in
all
that
is
gone
is
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
bring
my
wife
to
her
and
let
her
share
in
the
love
she
has
for
me
but
that
too
will
come
please
god
in
the
morning
i
sent
a
message
to
rooke
at
otranto
instructing
him
by
code
to
bring
the
yacht
to
vissarion
in
the
coming
night
all
day
i
spent
in
going
about
amongst
the
mountaineers
drilling
them
and
looking
after
their
arms
i
could
not
stay
still
my
only
chance
of
peace
was
to
work
my
only
chance
of
sleep
to
tire
myself
out
unhappily
i
am
very
strong
so
even
when
i
came
home
at
dark
i
was
quite
fresh
however
i
found
a
cable
message
from
rooke
that
the
yacht
would
arrive
at
midnight
there
was
no
need
to
summon
the
mountaineers
as
the
men
in
the
castle
would
be
sufficient
to
make
preparations
for
the
yachts
coming
later
the
yacht
has
come
at
halfpast
eleven
the
lookout
signalled
that
a
steamer
without
lights
was
creeping
in
towards
the
creek
i
ran
out
to
the
flagstaff
and
saw
her
steal
in
like
a
ghost
she
is
painted
a
steely
bluegrey
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
see
her
at
any
distance
she
certainly
goes
wonderfully
although
there
was
not
enough
throb
from
the
engines
to
mar
the
absolute
stillness
she
came
on
at
a
fine
speed
and
within
a
few
minutes
was
close
to
the
boom
i
had
only
time
to
run
down
to
give
orders
to
draw
back
the
boom
when
she
glided
in
and
stopped
dead
at
the
harbour
wall
rooke
steered
her
himself
and
he
says
he
never
was
on
a
boat
that
so
well
or
so
quickly
answered
her
helm
she
is
certainly
a
beauty
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
at
night
perfect
in
every
detail
i
promise
myself
a
few
pleasant
hours
over
her
in
the
daylight
the
men
seem
a
splendid
lot
but
i
do
not
feel
sleepy
i
despair
of
sleep
tonight
but
work
demands
that
i
be
fit
for
whatever
may
come
and
so
i
shall
try
to
sleepto
rest
at
any
rate

i
was
up
with
the
first
ray
of
sunrise
so
by
the
time
i
had
my
bath
and
was
dressed
there
was
ample
light
i
went
down
to
the
dock
at
once
and
spent
the
morning
looking
over
the
vessel
which
fully
justifies
rookes
enthusiasm
about
her
she
is
built
on
lovely
lines
and
i
can
quite
understand
that
she
is
enormously
fast
her
armour
i
can
only
take
on
the
specifications
but
her
armament
is
really
wonderful
and
there
are
not
only
all
the
very
newest
devices
of
aggressive
warfareindeed
she
has
the
newest
uptodate
torpedoes
and
torpedogunsbut
also
the
oldfashioned
rockettubes
which
in
certain
occasions
are
so
useful
she
has
electric
guns
and
the
latest
massillon
waterguns
and
reinhardt
electropneumatic
deliverers
for
pyroxiline
shells
she
is
even
equipped
with
warballoons
easy
of
expansion
and
with
compressible
kitson
aeroplanes
i
dont
suppose
that
there
is
anything
quite
like
her
in
the
world
the
crew
are
worthy
of
her
i
cant
imagine
where
rooke
picked
up
such
a
splendid
lot
of
men
they
are
nearly
all
manofwarsmen
of
various
nationalities
but
mostly
british
all
young
menthe
oldest
of
them
hasnt
got
into
the
fortiesand
so
far
as
i
can
learn
all
experts
of
one
kind
or
another
in
some
special
subject
of
warfare
it
will
go
hard
with
me
but
i
shall
keep
them
together
how
i
got
through
the
rest
of
the
day
i
know
not
i
tried
hard
not
to
create
any
domestic
trouble
by
my
manner
lest
aunt
janet
should
after
her
lurid
dream
or
vision
of
last
night
attach
some
new
importance
to
it
i
think
i
succeeded
for
she
did
not
so
far
as
i
could
tell
take
any
special
notice
of
me
we
parted
as
usual
at
halfpast
ten
and
i
came
here
and
made
this
entry
in
my
journal
i
am
more
restless
than
ever
tonight
and
no
wonder
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
pay
a
visit
to
st
savas
and
see
my
wife
againif
it
were
only
sleeping
in
her
tomb
but
i
dare
not
do
even
that
lest
she
should
come
to
see
me
here
and
i
should
miss
her
so
i
have
done
what
i
can
the
glass
door
to
the
terrace
is
open
so
that
she
can
enter
at
once
if
she
comes
the
fire
is
lit
and
the
room
is
warm
there
is
food
ready
in
case
she
should
care
for
it
i
have
plenty
of
light
in
the
room
so
that
through
the
aperture
where
i
have
not
fully
drawn
the
curtain
there
may
be
light
to
guide
her
oh
how
the
time
drags
the
clock
has
struck
midnight
one
two
thank
goodness
it
will
shortly
be
dawn
and
the
activity
of
the
day
may
begin
work
may
again
prove
in
a
way
to
be
an
anodyne
in
the
meantime
i
must
write
on
lest
despair
overwhelm
me
once
during
the
night
i
thought
i
heard
a
footstep
outside
i
rushed
to
the
window
and
looked
out
but
there
was
nothing
to
see
no
sound
to
hear
that
was
a
little
after
one
oclock
i
feared
to
go
outside
lest
that
should
alarm
her
so
i
came
back
to
my
table
i
could
not
write
but
i
sat
as
if
writing
for
a
while
but
i
could
not
stand
it
so
rose
and
walked
about
the
room
as
i
walked
i
felt
that
my
ladyit
gives
me
a
pang
every
time
i
remember
that
i
do
not
know
even
her
namewas
not
quite
so
far
away
from
me
it
made
my
heart
beat
to
think
that
it
might
mean
that
she
was
coming
to
me
could
not
i
as
well
as
aunt
janet
have
a
little
second
sight
i
went
towards
the
window
and
standing
behind
the
curtain
listened
far
away
i
thought
i
heard
a
cry
and
ran
out
on
the
terrace
but
there
was
no
sound
to
be
heard
and
no
sign
of
any
living
thing
anywhere
so
i
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
the
cry
of
some
night
bird
and
came
back
to
my
room
and
wrote
at
my
journal
till
i
was
calm
i
think
my
nerves
must
be
getting
out
of
order
when
every
sound
of
the
night
seems
to
have
a
special
meaning
for
me

1907
when
the
grey
of
the
morning
came
i
gave
up
hope
of
my
wife
appearing
and
made
up
my
mind
that
so
soon
as
i
could
get
away
without
exciting
aunt
janets
attention
i
would
go
to
st
savas
i
always
eat
a
good
breakfast
and
did
i
forgo
it
altogether
it
would
be
sure
to
excite
her
curiositya
thing
i
do
not
wish
at
present
as
there
was
still
time
to
wait
i
lay
down
on
my
bed
as
i
was
andsuch
is
the
way
of
fateshortly
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
by
a
terrific
clattering
at
my
door
when
i
opened
it
i
found
a
little
group
of
servants
very
apologetic
at
awaking
me
without
instructions
the
chief
of
them
explained
that
a
young
priest
had
come
from
the
vladika
with
a
message
so
urgent
that
he
insisted
on
seeing
me
immediately
at
all
hazards
i
came
out
at
once
and
found
him
in
the
hall
of
the
castle
standing
before
the
great
fire
which
was
always
lit
in
the
early
morning
he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
but
before
giving
it
to
me
he
said
i
am
sent
by
the
vladika
who
pressed
on
me
that
i
was
not
to
lose
a
single
instant
in
seeing
you
that
time
is
of
golden
pricenay
beyond
price
this
letter
amongst
other
things
vouches
for
me
a
terrible
misfortune
has
occurred
the
daughter
of
our
leader
has
disappeared
during
last
nightthe
same
he
commanded
me
to
remind
you
that
he
spoke
of
at
the
meeting
when
he
would
not
let
the
mountaineers
fire
their
guns
no
sign
of
her
can
be
found
and
it
is
believed
that
she
has
been
carried
off
by
the
emissaries
of
the
sultan
of
turkey
who
once
before
brought
our
nations
to
the
verge
of
war
by
demanding
her
as
a
wife
i
was
also
to
say
that
the
vladika
plamenac
would
have
come
himself
but
that
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
at
once
consult
with
the
archbishop
stevan
palealogue
as
to
what
step
is
best
to
take
in
this
dire
calamity
he
has
sent
out
a
searchparty
under
the
archimandrite
of
spazac
petrof
vlastimir
who
is
to
come
on
here
with
any
news
he
can
get
as
you
have
command
of
the
signalling
and
can
best
spread
the
news
he
knows
that
you
gospodar
are
in
your
great
heart
one
of
our
compatriots
and
that
you
have
already
proved
your
friendship
by
many
efforts
to
strengthen
our
hands
for
war
and
as
a
great
compatriot
he
calls
on
you
to
aid
us
in
our
need
he
then
handed
me
the
letter
and
stood
by
respectfully
whilst
i
broke
the
seal
and
read
it
it
was
written
in
great
haste
and
signed
by
the
vladika
come
with
us
now
in
our
nations
peril
help
us
to
rescue
what
we
most
adore
and
henceforth
we
shall
hold
you
in
our
hearts
you
shall
learn
how
the
men
of
the
blue
mountains
can
love
faith
and
valour
come
this
was
a
task
indeeda
duty
worthy
of
any
man
it
thrilled
me
to
the
core
to
know
that
the
men
of
the
blue
mountains
had
called
on
me
in
their
dire
need
it
woke
all
the
fighting
instinct
of
my
viking
forbears
and
i
vowed
in
my
heart
that
they
should
be
satisfied
with
my
work
i
called
to
me
the
corps
of
signallers
who
were
in
the
house
and
led
them
to
the
castle
roof
taking
with
me
the
young
messengerpriest
come
with
me
i
said
to
him
and
see
how
i
answer
the
vladikas
command
the
national
flag
was
run
upthe
established
signal
that
the
nation
was
in
need
instantly
on
every
summit
near
and
far
was
seen
the
flutter
of
an
answering
flag
quickly
followed
the
signal
that
commanded
the
call
to
arms
one
by
one
i
gave
the
signallers
orders
in
quick
succession
for
the
plan
of
search
unfolded
itself
to
me
as
i
went
on
the
arms
of
the
semaphore
whirled
in
a
way
that
made
the
young
priest
stare
one
by
one
as
they
took
their
orders
the
signallers
seemed
to
catch
fire
instinctively
they
understood
the
plan
and
worked
like
demigods
they
knew
that
so
widespread
a
movement
had
its
best
chance
in
rapidity
and
in
unity
of
action
from
the
forest
which
lay
in
sight
of
the
castle
came
a
wild
cheering
which
seemed
to
interpret
the
former
stillness
of
the
hills
it
was
good
to
feel
that
those
who
saw
the
signalstypes
of
manywere
ready
i
saw
the
look
of
expectation
on
the
face
of
the
messengerpriest
and
rejoiced
at
the
glow
that
came
as
i
turned
to
him
to
speak
of
course
he
wanted
to
know
something
of
what
was
going
on
i
saw
the
flashing
of
my
own
eyes
reflected
in
his
as
i
spoke
tell
the
vladika
that
within
a
minute
of
his
message
being
read
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
was
awake
the
mountaineers
are
already
marching
and
before
the
sun
is
high
there
will
be
a
line
of
guards
within

of
each
other
round
the
whole
frontierfrom

the

is
double
the
old
men
keep
guard
on
the
line
and
the
young
men
advance
these
will
close
in
at
the
advancing
line
so
that
nothing
can
escape
them
they
will
cover
mountaintop
and
forest
depth
and
will
close
in
finally
on
the
castle
here
which
they
can
behold
from
afar
my
own
yacht
is
here
and
will
sweep
the
coast
from
end
to
end
it
is
the
fastest
boat
afloat
and
armed
against
a
squadron
here
will
all
signals
come
in
an
hour
where
we
stand
will
be
a
signal
bureau
where
trained
eyes
will
watch
night
and
day
till
the
lost
one
has
been
found
and
the
outrage
has
been
avenged
the
robbers
are
even
now
within
a
ring
of
steel
and
cannot
escape
the
young
priest
all
on
fire
sprang
on
the
battlements
and
shouted
to
the
crowd
which
was
massing
round
the
castle
in
the
gardens
far
below
the
forest
was
giving
up
its
units
till
they
seemed
like
the
nucleus
of
an
army
the
men
cheered
lustily
till
the
sound
swung
high
up
to
us
like
the
roaring
of
a
winter
sea
with
bared
heads
they
were
crying
god
and
the
blue
mountains
god
and
the
blue
mountains
i
ran
down
to
them
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
began
to
issue
their
instructions
within
a
time
to
be
computed
by
minutes
the
whole
number
organized
by
sections
had
started
to
scour
the
neighbouring
mountains
at
first
they
had
only
understood
the
call
to
arms
for
general
safety
but
when
they
learned
that
the
daughter
of
a
chief
had
been
captured
they
simply
went
mad
from
something
which
the
messenger
first
said
but
which
i
could
not
catch
or
did
not
understand
the
blow
seemed
to
have
for
them
some
sort
of
personal
significance
which
wrought
them
to
a
frenzy
when
the
bulk
of
the
men
had
disappeared
i
took
with
me
a
few
of
my
own
men
and
several
of
the
mountaineers
whom
i
had
asked
to
remain
and
together
we
went
to
the
hidden
ravine
which
i
knew
we
found
the
place
empty
but
there
were
unmistakable
signs
that
a
party
of
men
had
been
encamped
there
for
several
days
some
of
our
men
who
were
skilled
in
woodcraft
and
in
signs
generally
agreed
that
there
must
have
been
some
twenty
of
them
as
they
could
not
find
any
trail
either
coming
to
or
going
from
the
place
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
have
come
separately
from
different
directions
and
gathered
there
and
that
they
must
have
departed
in
something
of
the
same
mysterious
way
however
this
was
at
any
rate
some
sort
of
a
beginning
and
the
men
separated
having
agreed
amongst
themselves
to
make
a
wide
cast
round
the
place
in
the
search
for
tracks
whoever
should
find
a
trail
was
to
follow
with
at
least
one
comrade
and
when
there
was
any
definite
news
it
was
to
be
signalled
to
the
castle
i
myself
returned
at
once
and
set
the
signallers
to
work
to
spread
amongst
our
own
people
such
news
as
we
had
when
presently
such
discoveries
as
had
been
made
were
signalled
with
flags
to
the
castle
it
was
found
that
the
marauders
had
in
their
flight
followed
a
strangely
zigzag
course
it
was
evident
that
in
trying
to
baffle
pursuit
they
had
tried
to
avoid
places
which
they
thought
might
be
dangerous
to
them
this
may
have
been
simply
a
method
to
disconcert
pursuit
if
so
it
was
in
a
measure
excellent
for
none
of
those
immediately
following
could
possibly
tell
in
what
direction
they
were
heading
it
was
only
when
we
worked
the
course
on
the
great
map
in
the
signallers
room
which
was
the
old
guard
room
of
the
castle
that
we
could
get
an
inkling
of
the
general
direction
of
their
flight
this
gave
added
trouble
to
the
pursuit
for
the
men
who
followed
being
ignorant
of
their
general
intent
could
not
ever
take
chance
to
head
them
off
but
had
to
be
ready
to
follow
in
any
or
every
direction
in
this
manner
the
pursuit
was
altogether
a
stern
chase
and
therefore
bound
to
be
a
long
one
as
at
present
we
could
not
do
anything
till
the
intended
route
was
more
marked
i
left
the
signalling
corps
to
the
task
of
receiving
and
giving
information
to
the
moving
bands
so
that
if
occasion
served
they
might
head
off
the
marauders
i
myself
took
rooke
as
captain
of
the
yacht
and
swept
out
of
the
creek
we
ran
up
north
to
dalairi
then
down
south
to
olesso
and
came
back
to
vissarion
we
saw
nothing
suspicious
except
far
off
to
the
extreme
southward
one
warship
which
flew
no
flag
rooke
however
who
seemed
to
know
ships
by
instinct
said
she
was
a
turk
so
on
our
return
we
signalled
along
the
whole
shore
to
watch
her
rooke
held
the
ladywhich
was
the
name
i
had
given
the
armoured
yachtin
readiness
to
dart
out
in
case
anything
suspicious
was
reported
he
was
not
to
stand
on
any
ceremony
but
if
necessary
to
attack
we
did
not
intend
to
lose
a
point
in
this
desperate
struggle
which
we
had
undertaken
we
had
placed
in
different
likely
spots
a
couple
of
our
own
men
to
look
after
the
signalling
when
i
got
back
i
found
that
the
route
of
the
fugitives
who
had
now
joined
into
one
party
had
been
definitely
ascertained
they
had
gone
south
but
manifestly
taking
alarm
from
the
advancing
line
of
guards
had
headed
up
again
to
the
northeast
where
the
country
was
broader
and
the
mountains
wilder
and
less
inhabited
forthwith
leaving
the
signalling
altogether
in
the
hands
of
the
fighting
priests
i
took
a
small
chosen
band
of
the
mountaineers
of
our
own
district
and
made
with
all
the
speed
we
could
to
cut
across
the
track
of
the
fugitives
a
little
ahead
of
them
the
archimandrite
abbot
of
spazac
who
had
just
arrived
came
with
us
he
is
a
splendid
mana
real
fighter
as
well
as
a
holy
cleric
as
good
with
his
handjar
as
with
his
bible
and
a
runner
to
beat
the
band
the
marauders
were
going
at
a
fearful
pace
considering
that
they
were
all
afoot
so
we
had
to
go
fast
also
amongst
these
mountains
there
is
no
other
means
of
progressing
our
own
men
were
so
aflame
with
ardour
that
i
could
not
but
notice
that
they
more
than
any
of
the
others
whom
i
had
seen
had
some
special
cause
for
concern
when
i
mentioned
it
to
the
archimandrite
who
moved
by
my
side
he
answered
all
natural
enough
they
are
not
only
fighting
for
their
country
but
for
their
own
i
did
not
quite
understand
his
answer
and
so
began
to
ask
him
some
questions
to
the
effect
that
i
soon
began
to
understand
a
good
deal
more
than
he
did
letter
from
archbishop
stevan

head
of
the

written

1907
honoured
lady
as
you
wish
for
an
understanding
regarding
the
late
lamentable
occurrence
in
which
so
much
danger
was
incurred
to
this
our
land
of
the
blue
mountains
and
one
dear
to
us
i
send
these
words
by
request
of
the
gospodar
rupert
beloved
of
our
mountaineers
when
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
made
his
journey
to
the
great
nation
to
whom
we
looked
in
our
hour
of
need
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
go
in
secret
the
turk
was
at
our
gates
and
full
of
the
malice
of
baffled
greed
already
he
had
tried
to
arrange
a
marriage
with
the
voivodin
so
that
in
time
to
come
he
as
her
husband
might
have
established
a
claim
to
the
inheritance
of
the
land
well
he
knew
as
do
all
men
that
the
blue
mountaineers
owe
allegiance
to
none
that
they
themselves
do
not
appoint
to
rulership
this
has
been
the
history
in
the
past
but
now
and
again
an
individual
has
arisen
or
come
to
the
front
adapted
personally
for
such
government
as
this
land
requires
and
so
the
lady
teuta
voivodin
of
the
blue
mountains
was
put
for
her
proper
guarding
in
the
charge
of
myself
as
head
of
the
eastern
church
in
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
steps
being
taken
in
such
wise
that
no
capture
of
her
could
be
effected
by
unscrupulous
enemies
of
this
our
land
this
task
and
guardianship
was
gladly
held
as
an
honour
by
all
concerned
for
the
voivodin
teuta
of
vissarion
must
be
taken
as
representing
in
her
own
person
the
glory
of
the
old
serb
race
inasmuch
as
being
the
only
child
of
the
voivode
vissarion
last
male
of
his
princely
racethe
race
which
ever
during
the
ten
centuries
of
our
history
unflinchingly
gave
life
and
all
they
held
for
the
protection
safety
and
wellbeing
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
never
during
those
centuries
had
any
one
of
the
race
been
known
to
fail
in
patriotism
or
to
draw
back
from
any
loss
or
hardship
enjoined
by
high
duty
or
stress
of
need
moreover
this
was
the
race
of
that
first
voivode
vissarion
of
whom
in
legend
it
was
prophesied
that
heonce
known
as
the
sword
of
freedom
a
giant
amongst
menwould
some
day
when
the
nation
had
need
of
him
come
forth
from
his
watertomb
in
the
lost
lake
of
reo
and
lead
once
more
the
men
of
the
blue
mountains
to
lasting
victory
this
noble
race
then
had
come
to
be
known
as
the
last
hope
of
the
land
so
that
when
the
voivode
was
away
on
his
countrys
service
his
daughter
should
be
closely
guarded
soon
after
the
voivode
had
gone
it
was
reported
that
he
might
be
long
delayed
in
his
diplomacies
and
also
in
studying
the
system
of
constitutional
monarchy
for
which
it
had
been
hoped
to
exchange
our
imperfect
political
system
i
may
say
inter
alia
that
he
was
mentioned
as
to
be
the
first
king
when
the
new
constitution
should
have
been
arranged
then
a
great
misfortune
came
on
us
a
terrible
grief
overshadowed
the
land
after
a
short
illness
the
voivodin
teuta
vissarion
died
mysteriously
of
a
mysterious
ailment
the
grief
of
the
mountaineers
was
so
great
that
it
became
necessary
for
the
governing
council
to
warn
them
not
to
allow
their
sorrow
to
be
seen
it
was
imperatively
necessary
that
the
fact
of
her
death
should
be
kept
secret
for
there
were
dangers
and
difficulties
of
several
kinds
in
the
first
place
it
was
advisable
that
even
her
father
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
his
terrible
loss
it
was
well
known
that
he
held
her
as
the
very
core
of
his
heart
and
that
if
he
should
hear
of
her
death
he
would
be
too
much
prostrated
to
be
able
to
do
the
intricate
and
delicate
work
which
he
had
undertaken
nay
more
he
would
never
remain
afar
off
under
the
sad
circumstances
but
would
straightway
return
so
as
to
be
in
the
land
where
she
lay
then
suspicions
would
crop
up
and
the
truth
must
shortly
be
known
afield
with
the
inevitable
result
that
the
land
would
become
the
very
centre
of
a
war
of
many
nations
in
the
second
place
if
the
turks
were
to
know
that
the
race
of
vissarion
was
becoming
extinct
this
would
encourage
them
to
further
aggression
which
would
become
immediate
should
they
find
out
that
the
voivode
was
himself
away
it
was
well
known
that
they
were
already
only
suspending
hostilities
until
a
fitting
opportunity
should
arise
their
desire
for
aggression
had
become
acute
after
the
refusal
of
the
nation
and
of
the
girl
herself
that
she
should
become
a
wife
of
the
sultan
the
dead
girl
had
been
buried
in
the
crypt
of
the
church
of
st
sava
and
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
singly
and
in
parties
the
sorrowing
mountaineers
had
come
to
pay
devotion
and
reverence
at
her
tomb
so
many
had
wished
to
have
a
last
glimpse
of
her
face
that
the
vladika
had
with
my
own
consent
as
archbishop
arranged
for
a
glass
cover
to
be
put
over
the
stone
coffin
wherein
her
body
lay
after
a
little
time
however
there
came
a
belief
to
all
concerned
in
the
guarding
of
the
bodythese
of
course
being
the
priests
of
various
degrees
of
dignity
appointed
to
the
taskthat
the
voivodin
was
not
really
dead
but
only
in
a
strangelyprolonged
trance
thereupon
a
new
complication
arose
our
mountaineers
are
as
perhaps
you
know
by
nature
deeply
suspiciousa
characteristic
of
all
brave
and
selfsacrificing
people
who
are
jealous
of
their
noble
heritage
having
as
they
believed
seen
the
girl
dead
they
might
not
be
willing
to
accept
the
fact
of
her
being
alive
they
might
even
imagine
that
there
was
on
foot
some
deep
dark
plot
which
was
or
might
be
a
menace
now
or
hereafter
to
their
independence
in
any
case
there
would
be
certain
to
be
two
parties
on
the
subject
a
dangerous
and
deplorable
thing
in
the
present
condition
of
affairs
as
the
trance
or
catalepsy
whatever
it
was
continued
for
many
days
there
had
been
ample
time
for
the
leaders
of
the
council
the
vladika
the
priesthood
represented
by
the
archimandrite
of
spazac
myself
as
archbishop
and
guardian
of
the
voivodin
in
her
fathers
absence
to
consult
as
to
a
policy
to
be
observed
in
case
of
the
girl
awaking
for
in
such
case
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
would
be
multiplied
indefinitely
in
the
secret
chambers
of
st
savas
we
had
many
secret
meetings
and
were
finally
converging
on
agreement
when
the
end
of
the
trance
came
the
girl
awoke
she
was
of
course
terribly
frightened
when
she
found
herself
in
a
tomb
in
the
crypt
it
was
truly
fortunate
that
the
great
candles
around
her
tomb
had
been
kept
lighted
for
their
light
mitigated
the
horror
of
the
place
had
she
waked
in
darkness
her
reason
might
have
become
unseated
she
was
however
a
very
noble
girl
brave
with
extraordinary
will
and
resolution
and
selfcommand
and
power
of
endurance
when
she
had
been
taken
into
one
of
the
secret
chambers
of
the
church
where
she
was
warmed
and
cared
for
a
hurried
meeting
was
held
by
the
vladika
myself
and
the
chiefs
of
the
national
council
word
had
been
at
once
sent
to
me
of
the
joyful
news
of
her
recovery
and
with
the
utmost
haste
i
came
arriving
in
time
to
take
a
part
in
the
council
at
the
meeting
the
voivodin
was
herself
present
and
full
confidence
of
the
situation
was
made
to
her
she
herself
proposed
that
the
belief
in
her
death
should
be
allowed
to
prevail
until
the
return
of
her
father
when
all
could
be
effectively
made
clear
to
this
end
she
undertook
to
submit
to
the
terrific
strain
which
such
a
proceeding
would
involve
at
first
we
men
could
not
believe
that
any
woman
could
go
through
with
such
a
task
and
some
of
us
did
not
hesitate
to
voice
our
doubtsour
disbelief
but
she
stood
to
her
guns
and
actually
downfaced
us
at
the
last
we
remembering
things
that
had
been
done
though
long
ages
ago
by
others
of
her
race
came
to
believe
not
merely
in
her
selfbelief
and
intention
but
even
in
the
feasibility
of
her
plan
she
took
the
most
solemn
oaths
not
to
betray
the
secret
under
any
possible
stress
the
priesthood
undertook
through
the
vladika
and
myself
to
further
a
ghostly
belief
amongst
the
mountaineers
which
would
tend
to
prevent
a
too
close
or
too
persistent
observation
the
vampire
legend
was
spread
as
a
protection
against
partial
discovery
by
any
mischance
and
other
weird
beliefs
were
set
afoot
and
fostered
arrangements
were
made
that
only
on
certain
days
were
the
mountaineers
to
be
admitted
to
the
crypt
she
agreeing
that
for
these
occasions
she
was
to
take
opiates
or
carry
out
any
other
aid
to
the
preservation
of
the
secret
she
was
willing
she
impressed
upon
us
to
make
any
personal
sacrifice
which
might
be
deemed
necessary
for
the
carrying
out
her
fathers
task
for
the
good
of
the
nation
of
course
she
had
at
first
terrible
frights
lying
alone
in
the
horror
of
the
crypt
but
after
a
time
the
terrors
of
the
situation
if
they
did
not
cease
were
mitigated
there
are
secret
caverns
off
the
crypt
wherein
in
troublous
times
the
priests
and
others
of
high
place
have
found
safe
retreat
one
of
these
was
prepared
for
the
voivodin
and
there
she
remained
except
for
such
times
as
she
was
on
showand
certain
other
times
of
which
i
shall
tell
you
provision
was
made
for
the
possibility
of
any
accidental
visit
to
the
church
at
such
times
warned
by
an
automatic
signal
from
the
opening
door
she
was
to
take
her
place
in
the
tomb
the
mechanism
was
so
arranged
that
the
means
to
replace
the
glass
cover
and
to
take
the
opiate
were
there
ready
to
her
hand
there
was
to
be
always
a
watch
of
priests
at
night
in
the
church
to
guard
her
from
ghostly
fears
as
well
as
from
more
physical
dangers
and
if
she
was
actually
in
her
tomb
it
was
to
be
visited
at
certain
intervals
even
the
draperies
which
covered
her
in
the
sarcophagus
were
rested
on
a
bridge
placed
from
side
to
side
just
above
her
so
as
to
hide
the
rising
and
falling
of
her
bosom
as
she
slept
under
the
narcotic
after
a
while
the
prolonged
strain
began
to
tell
so
much
on
her
that
it
was
decided
that
she
should
take
now
and
again
exercise
out
of
doors
this
was
not
difficult
for
when
the
vampire
story
which
we
had
spread
began
to
be
widely
known
her
being
seen
would
be
accepted
as
a
proof
of
its
truth
still
as
there
was
a
certain
danger
in
her
being
seen
at
all
we
thought
it
necessary
to
exact
from
her
a
solemn
oath
that
so
long
as
her
sad
task
lasted
she
should
under
no
circumstances
ever
wear
any
dress
but
her
shroudthis
being
the
only
way
to
insure
secrecy
and
to
prevail
against
accident
there
is
a
secret
way
from
the
crypt
to
a
sea
cavern
whose
entrance
is
at
hightide
under
the
waterline
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
on
which
the
church
is
built
a
boat
shaped
like
a
coffin
was
provided
for
her
and
in
this
she
was
accustomed
to
pass
across
the
creek
whenever
she
wished
to
make
excursion
it
was
an
excellent
device
and
most
efficacious
in
disseminating
the
vampire
belief
this
state
of
things
had
now
lasted
from
before
the
time
when
the
gospodar
rupert
came
to
vissarion
up
to
the
day
of
the
arrival
of
the
armoured
yacht
that
night
the
priest
on
duty
on
going
his
round
of
the
crypt
just
before
dawn
found
the
tomb
empty
he
called
the
others
and
they
made
full
search
the
boat
was
gone
from
the
cavern
but
on
making
search
they
found
it
on
the
farther
side
of
the
creek
close
to
the
garden
stairs
beyond
this
they
could
discover
nothing
she
seemed
to
have
disappeared
without
leaving
a
trace
straightway
they
went
to
the
vladika
and
signalled
to
me
by
the
firesignal
at
the
monastery
at
astrag
where
i
then
was
i
took
a
band
of
mountaineers
with
me
and
set
out
to
scour
the
country
but
before
going
i
sent
an
urgent
message
to
the
gospodar
rupert
asking
him
who
showed
so
much
interest
and
love
to
our
land
to
help
us
in
our
trouble
he
of
course
knew
nothing
then
of
all
have
now
told
you
nevertheless
he
devoted
himself
wholeheartedly
to
our
needsas
doubtless
you
know
but
the
time
had
now
come
close
when
the
voivode
vissarion
was
about
to
return
from
his
mission
and
we
of
the
council
of
his
daughters
guardianship
were
beginning
to
arrange
matters
so
that
at
his
return
the
good
news
of
her
being
still
alive
could
be
made
public
with
her
father
present
to
vouch
for
her
no
question
as
to
truth
could
arise
but
by
some
means
the
turkish
bureau
of
spies
must
have
got
knowledge
of
the
fact
already
to
steal
a
dead
body
for
the
purpose
of
later
establishing
a
fictitious
claim
would
have
been
an
enterprise
even
more
desperate
than
that
already
undertaken
we
inferred
from
many
signs
made
known
to
us
in
an
investigation
that
a
daring
party
of
the
sultans
emissaries
had
made
a
secret
incursion
with
the
object
of
kidnapping
the
voivodin
they
must
have
been
bold
of
heart
and
strong
of
resource
to
enter
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
on
any
errand
let
alone
such
a
desperate
one
as
this
for
centuries
we
have
been
teaching
the
turk
through
bitter
lessons
that
it
is
neither
a
safe
task
nor
an
easy
one
to
make
incursion
here
how
they
did
it
we
know
notat
present
but
enter
they
did
and
after
waiting
in
some
secret
hidingplace
for
a
favourable
opportunity
secured
their
prey
we
know
not
even
now
whether
they
had
found
entrance
to
the
crypt
and
stole
as
they
thought
the
dead
body
or
whether
by
some
dire
mischance
they
found
her
abroadunder
her
disguise
as
a
ghost
at
any
rate
they
had
captured
her
and
through
devious
ways
amongst
the
mountains
were
bearing
her
back
to
turkey
it
was
manifest
that
when
she
was
on
turkish
soil
the
sultan
would
force
a
marriage
on
her
so
as
eventually
to
secure
for
himself
or
his
successors
as
against
all
other
nations
a
claim
for
the
suzerainty
or
guardianship
of
the
blue
mountains
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
the
gospodar
rupert
threw
himself
into
the
pursuit
with
fiery
zeal
and
the
berserk
passion
which
he
inherited
from
viking
ancestors
whence
of
old
came
the
sword
of
freedom
himself
but
at
that
very
time
was
another
possibility
which
the
gospodar
was
himself
the
first
to
realize
failing
the
getting
the
voivodin
safe
to
turkish
soil
the
ravishers
might
kill
her
this
would
be
entirely
in
accord
with
the
base
traditions
and
history
of
the
moslems
so
too
it
would
accord
with
turkish
customs
and
the
sultans
present
desires
it
would
in
its
way
benefit
the
ultimate
strategetic
ends
of
turkey
for
were
once
the
vissarion
race
at
an
end
the
subjection
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
might
in
their
view
be
an
easier
task
than
it
had
yet
been
found
to
be
such
illustrious
lady

the

of
affairs

i
wonder
if
ever
in
the
long
strange
history
of
the
world
had
there
come
to
any
other
such
glad
tidings
as
came
to
meand
even
then
rather
inferentially
than
directlyfrom
the
archimandrites
answers
to
my
questioning
happily
i
was
able
to
restrain
myself
or
i
should
have
created
some
strange
confusion
which
might
have
evoked
distrust
and
would
certainly
have
hampered
us
in
our
pursuit
for
a
little
i
could
hardly
accept
the
truth
which
wove
itself
through
my
brain
as
the
true
inwardness
of
each
fact
came
home
to
me
and
took
its
place
in
the
whole
fabric
but
even
the
most
welcome
truth
has
to
be
accepted
some
time
by
even
a
doubting
heart
my
heart
whatever
it
may
have
been
was
not
then
a
doubting
heart
but
a
very
very
grateful
one
it
was
only
the
splendid
magnitude
of
the
truth
which
forbade
its
immediate
acceptance
i
could
have
shouted
for
joy
and
only
stilled
myself
by
keeping
my
thoughts
fixed
on
the
danger
which
my
wife
was
in
my
wife
my
wife
not
a
vampire
not
a
poor
harassed
creature
doomed
to
terrible
woe
but
a
splendid
woman
brave
beyond
belief
patriotic
in
a
way
which
has
but
few
peers
even
in
the
wide
history
of
bravery
i
began
to
understand
the
true
meaning
of
the
strange
occurrences
that
have
come
into
my
life
even
the
origin
and
purpose
of
that
first
strange
visit
to
my
room
became
clear
no
wonder
that
the
girl
could
move
about
the
castle
in
so
mysterious
a
manner
she
had
lived
there
all
her
life
and
was
familiar
with
the
secret
ways
of
entrance
and
exit
i
had
always
believed
that
the
place
must
have
been
honeycombed
with
secret
passages
no
wonder
that
she
could
find
a
way
to
the
battlements
mysterious
to
everybody
else
no
wonder
that
she
could
meet
me
at
the
flagstaff
when
she
so
desired
to
say
that
i
was
in
a
tumult
would
be
to
but
faintly
express
my
condition
i
was
rapt
into
a
heaven
of
delight
which
had
no
measure
in
all
my
adventurous
lifethe
lifting
of
the
veil
which
showed
that
my
wifeminewon
in
all
sincerity
in
the
very
teeth
of
appalling
difficulties
and
dangerswas
no
vampire
no
corpse
no
ghost
or
phantom
but
a
real
woman
of
flesh
and
blood
of
affection
and
love
and
passion
now
at
last
would
my
love
be
crowned
indeed
when
having
rescued
her
from
the
marauders
i
should
bear
her
to
my
own
home
where
she
would
live
and
reign
in
peace
and
comfort
and
honour
and
in
love
and
wifely
happiness
if
i
could
achieve
such
a
blessing
for
herand
for
myself
but
here
a
dreadful
thought
flashed
across
me
which
in
an
instant
turned
my
joy
to
despair
my
throbbing
heart
to
ice
as
she
is
a
real
woman
she
is
in
greater
danger
than
ever
in
the
hands
of
turkish
ruffians
to
them
a
woman
is
in
any
case
no
more
than
a
sheep
and
if
they
cannot
bring
her
to
the
harem
of
the
sultan
they
may
deem
it
the
next
wisest
step
to
kill
her
in
that
way
too
they
might
find
a
better
chance
of
escape
once
rid
of
her
the
party
could
separate
and
there
might
be
a
chance
of
some
of
them
finding
escape
as
individuals
that
would
not
exist
for
a
party
but
even
if
they
did
not
kill
her
to
escape
with
her
would
be
to
condemn
her
to
the
worst
fate
of
all
the
harem
of
the
turk
lifelong
misery
and
despairhowever
long
that
life
might
bemust
be
the
lot
of
a
christian
woman
doomed
to
such
a
lot
and
to
her
just
happily
wedded
and
after
she
had
served
her
country
in
such
a
noble
way
as
she
had
done
that
dreadful
life
of
shameful
slavery
would
be
a
misery
beyond
belief
she
must
be
rescuedand
quickly
the
marauders
must
be
caught
soon
and
suddenly
so
that
they
may
have
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
harm
her
as
they
would
be
certain
to
do
if
they
have
warning
of
immediate
danger
on
on
and
on
it
was
all
through
that
terrible
night
as
well
as
we
could
through
the
forest
it
was
a
race
between
the
mountaineers
and
myself
as
to
who
should
be
first
i
understood
now
the
feeling
that
animated
them
and
which
singled
them
out
even
from
amongst
their
fiery
comrades
when
the
danger
of
the
voivodin
became
known
these
men
were
no
mean
contestants
even
in
such
a
race
and
strong
as
i
am
it
took
my
utmost
effort
to
keep
ahead
of
them
they
were
keen
as
leopards
and
as
swift
their
lives
had
been
spent
among
the
mountains
and
their
hearts
and
souls
on
were
in
the
chase
i
doubt
not
that
if
the
death
of
any
one
of
us
could
have
through
any
means
effected
my
wifes
release
we
should
if
necessary
have
fought
amongst
ourselves
for
the
honour
from
the
nature
of
the
work
before
us
our
party
had
to
keep
to
the
top
of
the
hills
we
had
not
only
to
keep
observation
on
the
flying
party
whom
we
followed
and
to
prevent
them
making
discovery
of
us
but
we
had
to
be
always
in
a
position
to
receive
and
answer
signals
made
to
us

the

great
lady
i
am
asked
to
write
by
the
vladika
and
have
permission
of
the
archbishop
i
have
the
honour
of
transmitting
to
you
the
record
of
the
pursuit
of
the
turkish
spies
who
carried
off
the
voivodin
teuta
of
the
noble
house
of
vissarion
the
pursuit
was
undertaken
by
the
gospodar
rupert
who
asked
that
i
would
come
with
his
party
since
what
he
was
so
good
as
to
call
my
great
knowledge
of
the
country
and
its
people
might
serve
much
it
is
true
that
i
have
had
much
knowledge
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
and
its
people
amongst
which
and
whom
my
whole
life
has
been
passed
but
in
such
a
cause
no
reason
was
required
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
blue
mountains
who
would
not
have
given
his
life
for
the
voivodin
teuta
and
when
they
heard
that
she
had
not
been
dead
as
they
thought
but
only
in
a
trance
and
that
it
was
she
whom
the
marauders
had
carried
off
they
were
in
a
frenzy
so
why
should
ito
whom
has
been
given
the
great
trust
of
the
monastery
of
spazachesitate
at
such
a
time
for
myself
i
wanted
to
hurry
on
and
to
come
at
once
to
the
fight
with
my
countrys
foes
and
well
i
knew
that
the
gospodar
rupert
with
a
lions
heart
meet
for
his
giant
body
would
press
on
with
a
matchless
speed
we
of
the
blue
mountains
do
not
lag
when
our
foes
are
in
front
of
us
most
of
all
do
we
of
the
eastern
church
press
on
when
the
crescent
wars
against
the
cross
we
took
with
us
no
gear
or
hamper
of
any
kind
no
coverings
except
what
we
stood
in
no
foodnothing
but
our
handjars
and
our
rifles
with
a
sufficiency
of
ammunition
before
starting
the
gospodar
gave
hurried
orders
by
signal
from
the
castle
to
have
food
and
ammunition
sent
to
us
as
we
might
signal
by
the
nearest
hamlet
it
was
high
noon
when
we
started
only
ten
strongfor
our
leader
would
take
none
but
approved
runners
who
could
shoot
straight
and
use
the
handjar
as
it
should
be
used
so
as
we
went
light
we
expected
to
go
fast
by
this
time
we
knew
from
the
reports
signalled
to
vissarion
that
the
enemies
were
chosen
men
of
no
despicable
prowess
the
keeper
of
the
green
flag
of
islam
is
well
served
and
as
though
the
turk
is
an
infidel
and
a
dog
he
is
sometimes
brave
and
strong
indeed
except
when
he
passes
the
confines
of
the
blue
mountains
he
has
been
known
to
do
stirring
deeds
but
as
none
who
have
dared
to
wander
in
amongst
our
hills
ever
return
to
their
own
land
we
may
not
know
of
how
they
speak
at
home
of
their
battles
here
still
these
men
were
evidently
not
to
be
despised
and
our
gospodar
who
is
a
wise
man
as
well
as
a
valiant
warned
us
to
be
prudent
and
not
to
despise
our
foes
over
much
we
did
as
he
counselled
and
in
proof
we
only
took
ten
men
as
we
had
only
twenty
against
us
but
then
there
was
at
stake
much
beyond
life
and
we
took
no
risks
so
as
the
great
clock
at
vissarion
clanged
of
noon
the
eight
fastest
runners
of
the
blue
mountains
together
with
the
gospodar
rupert
and
myself
swept
out
on
our
journey
it
had
been
signalled
to
us
that
the
course
which
the
marauders
had
as
yet
taken
in
their
flight
was
a
zigzag
one
running
eccentrically
at
all
sorts
of
angles
in
all
sorts
of
directions
but
our
leader
had
marked
out
a
course
where
we
might
intercept
our
foes
across
the
main
line
of
their
flight
and
till
we
had
reached
that
region
we
paused
not
a
second
but
went
as
fast
as
we
could
all
night
long
indeed
it
was
amongst
us
a
race
as
was
the
olympic
race
of
old
greece
each
one
vying
with
his
fellows
though
not
in
jealous
emulation
but
in
high
spirit
to
best
serve
his
country
and
the
voivodin
teuta
foremost
amongst
us
went
the
gospodar
bearing
himself
as
a
paladin
of
old
his
mighty
form
pausing
for
no
obstacle
perpetually
did
he
urge
us
on
he
would
not
stop
or
pause
for
a
moment
but
often
as
he
and
i
ran
togetherfor
lady
in
my
youth
i
was
the
fleetest
of
all
in
the
race
and
even
that
now
can
head
a
battalion
when
duty
callshe
would
ask
me
certain
questions
as
to
the
lady
teuta
and
of
the
strange
manner
of
her
reputed
death
as
it
was
gradually
unfolded
in
my
answers
to
his
questioning
and
as
each
new
phase
of
knowledge
came
to
him
he
would
rush
on
as
one
possessed
of
fiends
whereat
our
mountaineers
who
seem
to
respect
even
fiends
for
their
thoroughness
would
strive
to
keep
pace
with
him
till
they
too
seemed
worked
into
diabolic
possession
and
i
myself
left
alone
in
the
calmness
of
sacerdotal
office
forgot
even
that
with
surging
ears
and
eyes
that
saw
blood
i
rushed
along
with
best
of
them
then
truly
the
spirit
of
a
great
captain
showed
itself
in
the
gospodar
for
when
others
were
charged
with
fury
he
began
to
force
himself
into
calm
so
that
out
of
his
present
selfcommand
and
the
memory
of
his
exalted
position
came
a
worthy
strategy
and
thought
for
every
contingency
that
might
arise
so
that
when
some
new
direction
was
required
for
our
guidance
there
was
no
hesitation
in
its
coming
we
nine
men
of
varying
kinds
all
felt
that
we
had
a
master
and
so
being
willing
to
limit
ourselves
to
strict
obedience
we
were
free
to
use
such
thoughts
as
well
as
such
powers
as
we
had
to
the
best
advantage
of
the
doing
we
came
across
the
trail
of
the
flying
marauders
on
the
second
morning
after
the
abduction
a
little
before
noon
it
was
easy
enough
to
see
for
by
this
time
the
miscreants
were
all
together
and
our
people
who
were
woodlanders
were
able
to
tell
much
of
the
party
that
passed
these
were
evidently
in
a
terrified
hurry
for
they
had
taken
no
precautions
such
as
are
necessary
baffle
pursuit
and
all
of
which
take
time
our
foresters
said
that
two
went
ahead
and
two
behind
in
the
centre
went
the
mass
moving
close
together
as
though
surrounding
their
prisoner
we
caught
not
even
a
single
glimpse
hercould
not
have
they
encompassed
her
so
closely
but
our
foresters
saw
other
than
the
mass
the
ground
that
had
been
passed
was
before
them
they
knew
that
the
prisoner
had
gone
unwillinglynay
more
one
of
them
said
as
he
rose
from
his
knees
where
he
had
been
examining
of
the
ground
the
misbegotten
dogs
have
been
urging
her
on
with
their
yataghans
there
are
drops
of
blood
though
there
are
no
bloodmarks
on
her
feet
whereupon
the
gospodar
flamed
with
passion
his
teeth
ground
together
and
with
a
deepbreathed
on
on
he
sprang
off
again
handjar
in
hand
on
the
track
before
long
we
saw
the
party
in
the
distance
they
this
were
far
below
us
in
a
deep
valley
although
the
track
of
their
going
passed
away
to
the
right
hand
they
were
making
for
the
base
of
the
great
cliff
which
rose
before
us
all
their
reason
was
twofold
as
we
soon
knew
far
off
down
the
valley
which
they
were
crossing
we
saw
signs
of
persons
coming
in
haste
who
must
be
of
the
search
party
coming
from
the
north
though
the
trees
hid
them
we
could
not
mistake
the
signs
i
was
myself
forester
enough
to
have
no
doubt
again
it
was
evident
that
the
young
voivodin
could
travel
no
longer
at
the
dreadful
pace
at
which
they
had
been
going
those
bloodmarks
told
their
own
tale
they
meant
to
make
a
last
stand
here
in
case
they
should
be
discovered
then
it
was
that
he
who
amongst
us
all
had
been
most
fierce
and
most
bent
on
rapid
pursuit
became
the
most
the
calm
raising
his
hand
for
silencethough
god
knows
we
were
and
had
been
silent
enough
during
that
long
rush
through
the
foresthe
said
in
a
low
keen
whisper
which
cut
the
silence
like
a
knife
my
friends
the
time
is
come
for
action
god
be
thanked
who
has
now
brought
us
face
to
face
with
our
foes
but
we
must
be
careful
herenot
on
our
own
account
for
we
wish
nothing
more
than
to
rush
on
and
conquer
or
diebut
for
the
sake
of
her
whom
you
love
and
whom
i
too
love
she
is
in
danger
from
anything
which
may
give
warning
to
those
fiends
if
they
know
or
even
suspect
for
an
instant
that
we
are
near
they
will
murder
her




here
his
voice
broke
for
an
instant
with
the
extremity
of
his
passion
or
the
depth
of
his
feelingi
hardly
know
which
i
think
both
acted
on
him
we
know
from
those
bloodmarks
what
they
can
doeven
to
her
his
teeth
ground
together
again
but
he
went
on
without
stopping
further
let
us
arrange
the
battle
though
we
are
but
little
distance
from
them
as
the
crow
flies
the
way
is
far
to
travel
there
is
i
can
see
but
one
path
down
to
the
valley
from
this
side
that
they
have
gone
by
and
that
they
will
sure
to
guardto
watch
at
any
rate
let
us
divide
as
to
surround
them
the
cliff
towards
which
they
make
runs
far
to
the
left
without
a
break
that
to
the
right
we
cannot
see
from
this
spot
but
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
it
is
not
unlikely
that
it
turns
round
in
this
direction
making
the
hither
end
of
the
valley
like
a
vast
pocket
or
amphitheatre
as
they
have
studied
the
ground
in
other
places
they
may
have
done
so
in
this
and
have
come
hither
as
to
a
known
refuge
let
one
man
a
marksman
stay
here
as
he
spoke
a
man
stepped
to
the
front
he
was
i
knew
an
excellent
shot
let
two
others
go
to
the
left
and
try
to
find
a
way
down
the
cliff
before
us
when
they
have
descended
to
the
level
of
the
valleypath
or
no
pathlet
them
advance
cautiously
and
secretly
keeping
their
guns
in
readiness
but
they
must
not
fire
till
need
remember
my
brothers
said
turning
to
those
who
stepped
out
a
pace
or
two
to
the
left
that
the
first
shot
gives
the
warning
which
will
be
the
signal
for
the
voivodins
death
these
men
will
not
hesitate
you
must
judge
yourselves
of
the
time
to
shoot
the
others
of
us
will
move
to
the
right
and
try
to
find
a
path
on
that
side
if
the
valley
be
indeed
a
pocket
between
the
cliffs
we
must
find
a
way
down
that
is
not
a
path
as
he
spoke
thus
there
was
a
blaze
in
his
eyes
that
betokened
no
good
to
aught
that
might
stand
in
his
way
i
ran
by
his
side
as
we
moved
to
the
right
it
was
as
he
surmised
about
the
cliff
when
we
got
a
little
on
our
way
we
saw
how
the
rocky
formation
trended
to
our
right
till
finally
with
a
wide
curve
it
came
round
to
the
other
side
it
was
a
fearful
valley
that
with
its
narrow
girth
and
its
towering
walls
that
seemed
to
topple
over
on
the
farther
side
from
us
the
great
trees
that
clothed
the
slope
of
the
mountain
over
it
grew
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
rock
so
that
their
spreading
branches
hung
far
over
the
chasm
and
so
far
as
we
could
understand
the
same
condition
existed
on
our
own
side
below
us
the
valley
was
dark
even
in
the
daylight
we
could
best
tell
the
movement
of
the
flying
marauders
by
the
flashes
of
the
white
shroud
of
their
captive
in
the
midst
of
them
from
where
we
were
grouped
amid
the
great
treetrunks
on
the
very
brow
of
the
cliff
we
could
when
our
eyes
were
accustomed
to
the
shadow
see
them
quite
well
in
great
haste
and
half
dragging
half
carrying
the
voivodin
they
crossed
the
open
space
and
took
refuge
in
a
little
grassy
alcove
surrounded
save
for
its
tortuous
entrance
by
undergrowth
from
the
valley
level
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
see
them
though
we
from
our
altitude
could
see
over
the
stunted
undergrowth
when
within
the
glade
they
took
their
hands
from
her
she
shuddering
instinctively
withdrew
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
dell
and
then
oh
shame
on
their
manhoodturks
and
heathens
though
they
werewe
could
see
that
they
had
submitted
her
to
the
indignity
of
gagging
her
and
binding
her
hands
our
voivodin
teuta
bound
to
one
and
all
of
us
it
was
like
lashing
us
across
the
face
i
heard
the
gospodars
teeth
grind
again
but
once
more
he
schooled
himself
to
calmness
ere
he
said
it
is
perhaps
as
well
great
though
the
indignity
be
they
are
seeking
their
own
doom
which
is
coming
quickly



moreover
they
are
thwarting
their
own
base
plans
now
that
she
is
bound
they
will
trust
to
their
binding
so
that
they
will
delay
their
murderous
alternative
to
the
very
last
moment
such
is
our
chance
of
rescuing
her
alive
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
as
still
as
a
stone
as
though
revolving
something
in
his
mind
whilst
he
watched
i
could
see
that
some
grim
resolution
was
forming
in
his
mind
for
his
eyes
ranged
to
the
top
of
the
trees
above
cliff
and
down
again
very
slowly
this
time
as
though
measuring
and
studying
the
detail
of
what
was
in
front
of
him
then
he
spoke
they
are
in
hopes
that
the
other
pursuing
party
may
not
come
across
them
to
know
that
they
are
waiting
if
those
others
do
not
come
up
the
valley
they
will
proceed
on
their
way
they
will
return
up
the
path
the
way
they
came
there
we
can
wait
them
charge
into
the
middle
of
them
when
she
is
opposite
and
cut
down
those
around
her
then
the
others
will
open
fire
and
we
shall
be
rid
of
them
whilst
he
was
speaking
two
of
the
men
of
our
party
who
i
knew
to
be
good
sharpshooters
and
who
had
just
before
lain
on
their
faces
and
had
steadied
their
rifles
to
shoot
rose
to
their
feet
command
us
gospodar
they
said
simply
as
they
stood
to
attention
shall
we
go
to
the
head
of
the
ravine
road
and
there
take
hiding
he
thought
for
perhaps
a
minute
whilst
we
all
stood
as
silent
as
images
i
could
hear
our
hearts
beating
then
he
said
no
not
yet
there
is
time
for
that
yet
they
will
notcannot
stir
or
make
plans
in
any
way
till
they
know
whether
the
other
party
is
coming
towards
them
or
not
from
our
height
here
we
can
see
what
course
the
others
are
taking
long
before
those
villains
do
then
we
can
make
our
plans
and
be
ready
in
time
we
waited
many
minutes
but
could
see
no
further
signs
the
other
pursuing
party
these
had
evidently
adopted
greater
caution
in
their
movements
as
they
came
closer
to
where
they
expected
to
find
the
enemy
the
marauders
began
to
grow
anxious
even
at
our
distance
we
could
gather
as
much
from
their
attitude
and
movements
presently
when
the
suspense
of
their
ignorance
grew
too
much
for
them
they
drew
to
the
entrance
of
the
glade
which
was
the
farthest
place
to
which
without
exposing
themselves
to
anyone
who
might
come
to
the
valley
they
could
withdraw
from
their
captive
here
they
consulted
together
we
could
follow
from
their
gestures
what
they
were
saying
for
as
they
did
not
wish
their
prisoner
to
hear
their
gesticulation
was
enlightening
to
us
as
to
each
other
our
people
like
all
mountaineers
have
good
eyes
and
the
gospodar
is
himself
an
eagle
in
this
as
in
other
ways
three
men
stood
back
from
the
rest
they
stacked
their
rifles
so
that
they
could
seize
them
easily
then
they
drew
their
scimitars
and
stood
ready
as
though
on
guard
these
were
evidently
the
appointed
murderers
well
they
knew
their
work
for
though
they
stood
in
a
desert
place
with
none
within
long
distance
except
the
pursuing
party
of
whose
approach
they
would
have
good
notice
they
stood
so
close
to
their
prisoner
that
no
marksman
in
the
worldnow
or
that
ever
had
been
not
william
tell
himselfcould
have
harmed
any
of
them
without
at
least
endangering
her
two
of
them
turned
the
voivodin
round
so
that
her
face
was
towards
the
precipicein
which
position
she
could
not
see
what
was
going
onwhilst
he
who
was
evidently
leader
of
the
gang
explained
in
gesture
that
the
others
were
going
to
spy
upon
the
pursuing
party
when
they
had
located
them
he
or
one
of
his
men
would
come
out
of
the
opening
of
the
wood
wherein
they
had
had
evidence
of
them
and
hold
up
his
hand
that
was
to
be
the
signal
for
the
cutting
of
the
victims
throatsuch
being
the
chosen
method
villainous
even
for
heathen
murderers
of
her
death
there
was
not
one
of
our
men
who
did
not
grind
his
teeth
when
we
witnessed
the
grim
action
only
too
expressive
of
the
turk
as
he
drew
his
right
hand
clenched
as
though
he
held
a
yataghan
in
it
across
his
throat
at
the
opening
of
the
glade
all
the
spying
party
halted
whilst
the
leader
appointed
to
each
his
place
of
entry
of
the
wood
the
front
of
which
extended
in
an
almost
straight
across
the
valley
from
cliff
to
cliff
the
men
stooping
low
when
in
the
open
and
taking
instant
advantage
of
every
little
obstacle
on
the
ground
seemed
to
fade
like
spectres
with
incredible
swiftness
across
the
level
mead
and
were
swallowed
up
in
the
wood
when
they
had
disappeared
the
gospodar
rupert
revealed
to
us
the
details
of
the
plan
of
action
which
he
had
revolving
in
his
mind
he
motioned
us
to
follow
him
we
threaded
a
way
between
the
treetrunks
keeping
all
the
while
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
so
that
the
space
below
was
all
visible
to
us
when
we
had
got
round
the
curve
sufficiently
to
see
the
whole
of
the
wood
on
the
valley
level
without
losing
sight
of
the
voivodin
and
her
appointed
assassins
we
halted
under
his
direction
there
was
an
added
advantage
of
this
point
over
the
other
for
we
could
see
directly
the
rising
of
the
hillroad
up
which
farther
side
ran
the
continuation
of
the
mountain
path
which
the
marauders
had
followed
it
was
somewhere
on
that
path
that
the
other
pursuing
party
had
hoped
to
intercept
the
fugitives
the
gospodar
spoke
quickly
though
in
a
voice
of
command
which
true
soldiers
love
to
hear
brothers
the
time
has
come
when
we
can
strike
a
blow
for
teuta
and
the
land
do
you
two
marksmen
take
position
here
facing
the
wood
the
two
men
here
lay
down
and
got
their
rifles
ready
divide
the
frontage
of
the
wood
between
you
arrange
between
yourselves
the
limits
of
your
positions
the
very
instant
one
of
the
marauders
appears
cover
him
drop
him
before
he
emerges
from
the
wood
even
then
still
watch
and
treat
similarly
whoever
else
may
take
his
place
do
this
if
they
come
singly
till
not
a
man
is
left
remember
brothers
that
brave
hearts
alone
will
not
suffice
at
this
grim
crisis
in
this
hour
the
best
safety
of
the
voivodin
is
in
the
calm
spirit
and
the
steady
eye
then
he
turned
to
the
rest
of
us
and
spoke
to
me
archimandrite
of
plazac
you
who
are
interpreter
to
god
of
the
prayers
of
so
many
souls
my

has
come

there
is
but
one
thing
left
to
us
if
we
wish
to
save
the
voivodin
do
you
when
the
time
comes
take
these
men
and
join
the
watcher
at
the
top
of
the
ravine
road
when
the
shots
are
fired
do
you
out

and
rush
the
ravine
and
across
the
valley
brothers
you
may
be
in
time
to
avenge
the
voivodin
if
you
cannot
save
her
for
me
there
must
be
a
quicker
way
and
to
it
i
go
as
there

will
not
be

to
traverse

nature
finds
me
a
path
that
man

it

for

to
travel

that
giant
beechtree
that
towers
above
the
glade
where
the
voivodin
is

there

my
path

you
from
here

marked
the

me
a
signal
with
your
hatdo
not
use
a
handkerchief
as
others
might
see
its
white
and
take
warning
then
rush
that
ravine
i
shall
take
that
as
the
signal
for
my
descent
by
the
leafy
road
if
i
can
do
naught
else
i
can
crush
the
murderers
with
my
falling
weight
even
if
i
have
to
kill
her
too
at
least

shall
die
togetherand

lay
us
together
in
the
tomb
at
st
savas
farewell
if
it
be
the
last
he
threw
down
the
scabbard
in
which
he
carried
his
handjar
adjusted
the
naked
weapon
in
his
belt
behind
his
back
and
was
gone
we
who
were
not
watching
the
wood
kept
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
great
beechtree
and
with
new
interest
noticed
the
long
trailing
branches
which
hung
low
and
swayed
even
in
the
gentle
breeze
for
a
few
minutes
which
seemed
amazingly
long
we
saw
no
sign
of
him
then
high
up
on
one
of
the
great
branches
which
stood
clear
of
obscuring
leaves
we
saw
something
crawling
flat
against
the
bark
he
was
well
out
on
the
branch
hanging
far
over
the
precipice
he
was
looking
over
at
us
and
i
waved
my
hand
so
that
he
should
know
we
saw
him
he
was
clad
in
greenhis
usual
forest
dressso
that
there
was
not
any
likelihood
of
any
other
eyes
noticing
him
i
took
off
my
hat
and
held
it
ready
to
signal
with
when
the
time
should
come
i
glanced
down
at
the
glade
and
saw
the
voivodin
standing
still
safe
with
her
guards
so
close
to
her
as
to
touch
then
i
too
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
wood
suddenly
the
man
standing
beside
me
seized
my
arm
and
pointed
i
could
just
see
through
the
trees
which
were
lower
than
elsewhere
in
the
front
of
the
wood
a
turk
moving
stealthily
so
i
waved
my
hat
at
the
same
time
a
rifle
underneath
me
cracked
a
second
or
two
later
the
spy
pitched
forward
on
his
face
and
lay
still
at
the
same
instant
my
eyes
sought
the
beechtree
and
i
saw
the
closelying
figure
raise
itself
and
slide
forward
to
a
joint
of
the
branch
then
the
gospodar
as
he
rose
hurled
himself
forward
amid
the
mass
of
the
trailing
branches
he
dropped
like
a
stone
and
my
heart
sank
but
an
instant
later
he
seemed
in
poise
he
had
clutched
the
thin
trailing
branches
as
he
fell
and
as
he
sank
a
number
of
leaves
which
his
motion
had
torn
off
floated
out
round
him
again
the
rifle
below
me
cracked
and
then
again
and
again
and
again
the
marauders
had
taken
warning
and
were
coming
out
in
mass
but
my
own
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
tree
almost
as
a
thunderbolt
falls
fell
the
giant
body
of
the
gospodar
his
size
lost
in
the
immensity
of
his
surroundings
he
fell
in
a
series
of
jerks
as
he
kept
clutching
the
trailing
beechbranches
whilst
they
lasted
and
then
other
lesser
verdure
growing
out
from
the
fissures
in
the
rock
after
the
lengthening
branches
had
with
all
their
elasticity
reached
their
last
point
at
lengthfor
though
this
all
took
place
in
a
very
few
seconds
the
gravity
of
the
crisis
prolonged
them
immeasurablythere
came
a
large
space
of
rock
some
three
times
his
own
length
he
did
not
pause
but
swung
himself
to
one
side
so
that
he
should
fall
close
to
the
voivodin
and
her
guards
these
men
did
not
seem
to
notice
for
their
attention
was
fixed
on
the
wood
whence
they
expected
their
messenger
to
signal
but
they
raised
their
yataghans
in
readiness
the
shots
had
alarmed
them
and
they
meant
to
do
the
murder
nowmessenger
or
no
messenger
but
though
the
men
did
not
see
the
danger
from
above
the
voivodin
did
she
raised
her
eyes
quickly
at
the
first
sound
and
even
from
where
we
were
before
we
began
to
run
towards
the
ravine
path
i
could
see
the
triumphant
look
in
her
glorious
eyes
when
she
recognized
the
identity
of
the
man
who
was
seemingly
coming
straight
down
from
heaven
itself
to
help
heras
indeed
she
and
we
too
can
very
well
imagine
that
he
did
for
if
ever
heaven
had
a
hand
in
a
rescue
on
earth
it
was
now
even
during
the
last
drop
from
the
rocky
foliage
the
gospodar
kept
his
head
as
he
fell
he
pulled
his
handjar
free
and
almost
as
he
was
falling
its
sweep
took
off
the
head
of
one
of
the
assassins
as
he
touched
ground
he
stumbled
for
an
instant
but
it
was
towards
his
enemies
twice
with
lightning
rapidity
the
handjar
swept
the
air
and
at
each
sweep
a
head
rolled
on
the
sward
the
voivodin
held
up
her
tied
hands
again
the
handjar
flashed
this
time
downwards
and
the
lady
was
free
without
an
instants
pause
the
gospodar
tore
off
the
gag
and
with
his
left
arm
round
her
and
handjar
in
right
hand
stood
face
toward
his
living
foes
the
voivodin
stooped
suddenly
and
then
raising
the
yataghan
which
had
fallen
from
the
hand
of
one
of
the
dead
marauders
stood
armed
beside
him
the
rifles
were
now
cracking
fast
as
the
maraudersthose
that
were
left
of
themcame
rushing
out
into
the
open
but
well
the
marksmen
knew
their
work
well
they
bore
in
mind
the
gospodars
command
regarding
calmness
they
kept
picking
off
the
foremost
men
only
so
that
the
onward
rush
never
seemed
to
get
more
forward
as
we
rushed
down
the
ravine
we
could
see
clearly
all
before
us
but
now
just
as
we
were
beginning
to
fear
lest
some
mischance
might
allow
some
of
them
to
reach
the
glade
there
was
another
cause
of
surpriseof
rejoicing
from
the
face
of
the
wood
seemed
to
burst
all
at
once
a
body
of
men
all
wearing
the
national
cap
so
we
knew
them
as
our
own
they
were
all
armed
with
the
handjar
only
and
they
came
like
tigers
they
swept
on
the
rushing
turks
as
though
for
all
their
swiftness
they
were
standing
stillliterally
wiping
them
out
as
a
child
wipes
a
lesson
from
its
slate
a
few
seconds
later
these
were
followed
by
a
tall
figure
with
long
hair
and
beard
of
black
mingled
with
grey
instinctively
we
all
as
did
those
in
the
valley
shouted
with
joy
for
this
was
the
vladika
milosh
plamenac
himself
i
confess
that
knowing
what
i
knew
i
was
for
a
short
space
of
time
anxious
lest
in
the
terrific
excitement
in
which
we
were
all
lapped
someone
might
say
or
do
something
which
might
make
for
trouble
later
on
the
gospodars
splendid
achievement
which
was
worthy
of
any
hero
of
old
romance
had
set
us
all
on
fire
he
himself
must
have
been
wrought
to
a
high
pitch
of
excitement
to
dare
such
an
act
and
it
is
not
at
such
a
time
that
discretion
must
be
expected
from
any
man
most
of
all
did
i
fear
danger
from
the
womanhood
of
the
voivodin
had
i
not
assisted
at
her
marriage
i
might
not
have
understood
then
what
it
must
have
been
to
her
to
be
saved
from
such
a
doom
at
such
a
time
by
such
a
man
who
was
so
much
to
her
and
in
such
a
way
it
would
have
been
only
natural
if
at
such
a
moment
of
gratitude
and
triumph
she
had
proclaimed
the
secret
which
we
of
the
council
of
the
nation
and
her
fathers
commissioners
had
so
religiously
kept
but
none
of
us
knew
then
either
the
voivodin
or
the
gospodar
rupert
as
we
do
now
it
was
well
that
they
were
as
they
are
for
the
jealousy
and
suspicion
of
our
mountaineers
might
even
at
such
a
moment
and
even
whilst
they
throbbed
at
such
a
deed
have
so
manifested
themselves
as
to
have
left
a
legacy
of
distrust
the
vladika
and
i
who
of
all
save
the
two
immediately
concerned
alone
knew
looked
at
each
other
apprehensively
but
at
that
instant
the
voivodin
with
a
swift
glance
at
her
husband
laid
a
finger
on
her
lip
and
he
with
quick
understanding
gave
assurance
by
a
similar
sign
then
she
sank
before
him
on
one
knee
and
raising
his
hand
to
her
lips
kissed
it
and
spoke
gospodar
rupert
i
owe
you
all
that
a
woman
may
owe
except
to
god
you
have
given
me
life
and
honour
i
cannot
thank
you
adequately
for
what
you
have
done
my
father
will
try
to
do
so
when
he
returns
but
i
am
right
sure
that
the
men
of
the
blue
mountains
who
so
value
honour
and
freedom
and
liberty
and
bravery
will
hold
you
in
their
hearts
for
ever
this
was
so
sweetly
spoken
with
lips
that
trembled
and
eyes
that
swam
in
tears
so
truly
womanly
and
so
in
accord
with
the
custom
of
our
nation
regarding
the
reverence
that
women
owe
to
men
that
the
hearts
of
our
mountaineers
were
touched
to
the
quick
their
noble
simplicity
found
expression
in
tears
but
if
the
gallant
gospodar
could
have
for
a
moment
thought
that
so
to
weep
was
unmanly
his
error
would
have
had
instant
correction
when
the
voivodin
had
risen
to
her
feet
which
she
did
with
queenly
dignity
the
men
around
closed
in
on
the
gospodar
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
and
in
a
second
held
him
above
their
heads
tossing
on
their
lifted
hands
as
if
on
stormy
breakers
it
was
as
though
the
old
vikings
of
whom
we
have
heard
and
whose
blood
flows
in
ruperts
veins
were
choosing
a
chief
in
old
fashion
i
was
myself
glad
that
the
men
were
so
taken
up
with
the
gospodar
that
they
did
not
see
the
glory
of
the
moment
in
the
voivodins
starry
eyes
for
else
they
might
have
guessed
the
secret
i
knew
from
the
vladikas
look
that
he
shared
my
own
satisfaction
even
as
he
had
shared
my
anxiety
as
the
gospodar
rupert
was
tossed
high
on
the
lifted
hands
of
the
mountaineers
their
shouts
rose
to
such
a
sudden
volume
that
around
us
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
frightened
birds
rose
from
the
forest
and
their
noisy
alarm
swelled
the
tumult
the
gospodar
ever
thoughtful
for
others
was
the
first
to
calm
himself
come
brothers
he
said
let
us
gain
the
hilltop
where
we
can
signal
to
the
castle
it
is
right
that
the
whole
nation
should
share
in
the
glad
tidings
that
the
voivodin
teuta
of
vissarion
is
free
but
before
we
go
let
us
remove
the
arms
and
clothing
of
these
carrion
marauders
we
may
have
use
for
them
later
on
the
mountaineers
set
him
down
gently
enough
and
he
taking
the
voivodin
by
the
hand
and
calling
the
vladika
and
myself
close
to
them
led
the
way
up
the
ravine
path
which
the
marauders
had
descended
and
thence
through
the
forest
to
the
top
of
the
hill
that
dominated
the
valley
here
we
could
from
an
opening
amongst
the
trees
catch
a
glimpse
far
off
of
the
battlements
of
vissarion
forthwith
the
gospodar
signalled
and
on
the
moment
a
reply
of
their
awaiting
was
given
then
the
gospodar
signalled
the
glad
news
it
was
received
with
manifest
rejoicing
we
could
not
hear
any
sound
so
far
away
but
we
could
see
the
movement
of
lifted
faces
and
waving
hands
and
knew
that
it
was
well
but
an
instant
after
came
a
calm
so
dread
that
we
knew
before
the
semaphore
had
begun
to
work
that
there
was
bad
news
in
store
for
us
when
the
news
did
come
a
bitter
wailing
arose
amongst
us
for
the
news
that
was
signalled
ran
the
voivode
has
been
captured
by
the
turks
on
his
return
and
is
held
by
them
at
ilsin
in
an
instant
the
temper
of
the
mountaineers
changed
it
was
as
though
by
a
flash
summer
had
changed
to
winter
as
though
the
yellow
glory
of
the
standing
corn
had
been
obliterated
by
the
dreary
waste
of
snow
nay
more
it
was
as
when
one
beholds
the
track
of
the
whirlwind
when
the
giants
of
the
forest
are
levelled
with
the
sward
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
silence
and
then
with
an
angry
roar
as
when
god
speaks
in
the
thunder
came
the
fierce
determination
of
the
men
of
the
blue
mountains
to
ilsin
to
ilsin
and
a
stampede
in
the
direction
of
the
south
began
for
illustrious
lady
you
perhaps
who
have
been
for
so
short
a
time
at
vissarion
may
not
know
that
at
the
extreme
southern
point
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
lies
the
little
port
of
ilsin
which
long
ago
we
wrested
from
the
turk
the
stampede
was
checked
by
the
command
halt
spoken
in
a
thunderous
voice
by
the
gospodar
instinctively
all
stopped
the
gospodar
rupert
spoke
again
had
we
not
better
know
a
little
more
before
we
start
on
our
journey

have

did
not

the

the

signalled
were

profound

to
everything
which
has
been

he
asked
for

his

had
been

we
threefor
of
course
the
voivodin
was
with
us
she
had
refused
to
leave
the
gospodarset
out
hotfoot
after
our
comrades
but
by
the
time
we
had
descended
the
hill
it
was
evident
that
the
voivodin
could
not
keep
up
the
terrific
pace
at
which
we
were
going
she
struggled
heroically
but
the
long
journey
she
had
already
taken
and
the
hardship
and
anxiety
she
had
suffered
had
told
on
her
the
gospodar
stopped
and
said
that
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
press
onit
was
perhaps
her
fathers
lifeand
said
he
would
carry
her
no
no
she
answered
go
on
i
shall
follow
with
the
vladika
and
then
you
can
have
things
ready
to
get
on
soon
after
the
archbishop
and
council
arrive
they
kissed
each
other
after
on
her
part
a
shy
glance
at
me
and
he
went
on
the
track
of
our
comrades
at
a
great
pace
i
could
see
him
shortly
after
catch
them
upthough
they
too
were
going
fast
for
a
few
minutes
they
ran
together
he
speakingi
could
note
it
from
the
way
they
kept
turning
their
heads
towards
him
then
he
broke
away
from
them
hurriedly
he
went
like
a
stag
breaking
covert
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
they
halted
a
moment
or
two
then
some
few
ran
on
and
all
the
rest
came
back
towards
us
quickly
they
improvised
a
litter
with
cords
and
branches
and
insisted
that
the
voivodin
should
use
it
in
an
incredibly
short
time
we
were
under
way
again
and
proceeding
with
great
rapidity
towards
vissarion
the
men
took
it
in
turns
to
help
with
the
litter
i
had
the
honour
of
taking
a
hand
in
the
work
myself
about
a
third
of
the
way
out
from
vissarion
a
number
of
our
people
met
us
they
were
fresh
and
as
they
carried
the
litter
we
who
were
relieved
were
free
for
speed
so
we
soon
arrived
at
the
castle
here
we
found
all
humming
like
a
hive
of
bees
the
yacht
which
captain
rooke
had
kept
fired
ever
since
the
pursuing
party
under
the
gospodar
had
left
vissarion
was
already
away
and
tearing
up
the
coast
at
a
fearful
rate
the
rifles
and
ammunition
were
stacked
on
the
quay
the
fieldguns
too
were
equipped
and
the
cases
of
ammunition
ready
to
ship
the
men
two
hundred
of
them
were
paraded
in
full
kit
ready
to
start
at
a
moments
notice
the
provision
for
three
days
was
all
ready
to
put
aboard
and
barrels
of
fresh
water
to
trundle
aboard
when
the
yacht
should
return
at
one
end
of
the
quay
ready
to
lift
on
board
stood
also
the
gospodars
aeroplane
fully
equipped
and
ready
if
need
were
for
immediate
flight
i
was
glad
to
see
that
the
voivodin
seemed
none
the
worse
for
her
terrible
experience
she
still
wore
her
shroud
but
no
one
seemed
to
notice
it
as
anything
strange
the
whisper
had
evidently
gone
round
of
what
had
been
but
discretion
ruled
the
day
she
and
the
gospodar
met
as
two
who
had
served
and
suffered
in
common
but
i
was
glad
to
notice
that
both
kept
themselves
under
such
control
that
none
of
those
not
already
in
the
secret
even
suspected
that
there
was
any
love
between
them
let
alone
marriage
we
all
waited
with
what
patience
we
could
till
word
was
signalled
from
the
castle
tower
that
the
yacht
had
appeared
over
the
northern
horizon
and
was
coming
down
fast
keeping
inshore
as
she
came
when
she
arrived
we
heard
to
our
joy
that
all
concerned
had
done
their
work
well
the
archbishop
was
aboard
and
of
the
national
council
not
one
was
missing
the
gospodar
hurried
them
all
into
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
which
had
in
the
meantime
been
got
ready
i
too
went
with
him
but
the
voivodin
remained
without
when
all
were
seated
he
rose
and
said
my
lord
archbishop
vladika
and
lords
of
the
council
all
i
have
dared
to
summon
you
in
this
way
because
time
presses
and
the
life
of
one
you
all
lovethe
voivode
vissarionis
at
stake
this
audacious
attempt
of
the
turk
is
the
old
aggression
under
a
new
form
it
is
a
new
and
more
daring
step
than
ever
to
try
to
capture
your
chief
and
his
daughter
the
voivodin
whom
you
love
happily
the
latter
part
of
the
scheme
is
frustrated
the
voivodin
is
safe
and
amongst
us
but
the
voivode
is
held
prisonerif
indeed
he
be
still
alive
he
must
be
somewhere
near
ilsinbut
where
exactly
we
know
not
as
yet
we
have
an
expedition
ready
to
start
the
moment
we
receive
your
sanctionyour
commands
we
shall
obey
your
wishes
with
our
lives
but
as
the
matter
is
instant
i
would
venture
to
ask
one
question
and
one
only
shall
we
rescue
the
voivode
at
any
cost
that
may
present
itself
i
ask
this
for
the
matter
has
now
become
an
international
one
and
if
our
enemies
are
as
earnest
as
we
are
the
issue
is
war
having
so
spoken
and
with
a
dignity
and
force
which
is
inexpressible
he
withdrew
and

in

minutes

manned

1907
we
went
at
a
terrific
pace
down
the
coast
keeping
well
inshore
so
as
to
avoid
if
possible
being
seen
from
the
south
just
north
of
ilsin
a
rocky
headland
juts
out
and
that
was
our
cover
on
the
north
of
the
peninsula
is
a
small
landlocked
bay
with
deep
water
it
is
large
enough
to
take
the
yacht
though
a
much
larger
vessel
could
not
safely
enter
we
ran
in
and
anchored
close
to
the
shore
which
has
a
rocky
frontagea
natural
shelf
of
rock
which
is
practically
the
same
as
a
quay
here
we
met
the
men
who
had
come
from
ilsin
and
the
neighbourhood
in
answer
to
our
signalling
earlier
in
the
day
they
gave
us
the
latest
information
regarding
the
kidnapping
of
the
voivode
and
informed
us
that
every
man
in
that
section
of
the
country
was
simply
aflame
about
it
they
assured
us
that
we
could
rely
on
them
not
merely
to
fight
to
the
death
but
to
keep
silence
absolutely
whilst
the
seamen
under
the
direction
of
rooke
took
the
aeroplane
on
shore
and
found
a
suitable
place
for
it
where
it
was
hidden
from
casual
view
but
from
which
it
could
be
easily
launched
the
vladika
and
iand
of
course
my
wifewere
hearing
such
details
as
were
known
of
the
disappearance
of
her
father
it
seems
that
he
travelled
secretly
in
order
to
avoid
just
such
a
possibility
as
has
happened
no
one
knew
of
his
coming
till
he
came
to
fiume
whence
he
sent
a
guarded
message
to
the
archbishop
which
the
latter
alone
would
understand
but
this
turkish
agents
were
evidently
on
his
track
all
the
time
and
doubtless
the
bureau
of
spies
was
kept
well
advised
he
landed
at
ilsin
from
a
coasting
steamer
from
ragusa
to
the
levant
for
two
days
before
his
coming
there
had
been
quite
an
unusual
number
of
arrivals
at
the
little
port
at
which
arrivals
are
rare
and
it
turned
out
that
the
little
hotelthe
only
fairly
good
one
in
ilsinwas
almost
filled
up
indeed
only
one
room
was
left
which
the
voivode
took
for
the
night
the
innkeeper
did
not
know
the
voivode
in
his
disguise
but
suspected
who
it
was
from
the
description
he
dined
quietly
and
went
to
bed
his
room
was
at
the
back
on
the
groundfloor
looking
out
on
the
bank
of
the
little
river
silva
which
here
runs
into
the
harbour
no
disturbance
was
heard
in
the
night
late
in
the
morning
when
the
elderly
stranger
had
not
made
his
appearance
inquiry
was
made
at
his
door
he
did
not
answer
so
presently
the
landlord
forced
the
door
and
found
the
room
empty
his
luggage
was
seemingly
intact
only
the
clothes
which
he
had
worn
were
gone
a
strange
thing
was
that
though
the
bed
had
been
slept
in
and
his
clothes
were
gone
his
nightclothes
were
not
to
be
found
from
which
it
was
argued
by
the
local
authorities
when
they
came
to
make
inquiry
that
he
had
gone
or
been
taken
from
the
room
in
his
nightgear
and
that
his
clothes
had
been
taken
with
him
there
was
evidently
some
grim
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
for
they
had
commanded
absolute
silence
on
all
in
the
house
when
they
came
to
make
inquiry
as
to
the
other
guests
it
was
found
that
one
and
all
had
gone
in
the
course
of
the
morning
after
paying
their
bills
none
of
them
had
any
heavy
luggage
and
there
was
nothing
remaining
by
which
they
might
be
traced
or
which
would
afford
any
clue
to
their
identity
the
authorities
having
sent
a
confidential
report
to
the
seat
of
government
continued
their
inquiries
and
even
now
all
available
hands
were
at
work
on
the
investigation
when
i
had
signalled
to
vissarion
before
my
arrival
there
word
had
been
sent
through
the
priesthood
to
enlist
in
the
investigation
the
services
of
all
good
men
so
that
every
foot
of
ground
in
that
section
of
the
blue
mountains
was
being
investigated
the
portmaster
was
assured
by
his
watchmen
that
no
vessel
large
or
small
had
heft
the
harbour
during
the
night
the
inference
therefore
was
that
the
voivodes
captors
had
made
inland
with
himif
indeed
they
were
not
already
secreted
in
or
near
the
town
whilst
we
were
receiving
the
various
reports
a
hurried
message
came
that
it
was
now
believed
that
the
whole
party
were
in
the
silent
tower
this
was
a
wellchosen
place
for
such
an
enterprise
it
was
a
massive
tower
of
immense
strength
built
as
a
memorialand
also
as
a
keepafter
one
of
the
massacres
of
the
invading
turks
it
stood
on
the
summit
of
a
rocky
knoll
some
ten
miles
inland
from
the
port
of
ilsin
it
was
a
place
shunned
as
a
rule
and
the
country
all
around
it
was
so
arid
and
desolate
that
there
were
no
residents
near
it
as
it
was
kept
for
state
use
and
might
be
serviceable
in
time
of
war
it
was
closed
with
massive
iron
doors
which
were
kept
locked
except
upon
certain
occasions
the
keys
were
at
the
seat
of
government
at
plazac
if
therefore
it
had
been
possible
to
the
turkish
marauders
to
gain
entrance
and
exit
it
might
be
a
difficult
as
well
as
a
dangerous
task
to
try
to
cut
the
voivode
out
his
presence
with
them
was
a
dangerous
menace
to
any
force
attacking
them
for
they
would
hold
his
life
as
a
threat
i
consulted
with
the
vladika
at
once
as
to
what
was
best
to
be
done
and
we
decided
that
though
we
should
put
a
cordon
of
guards
around
it
at
a
safe
distance
to
prevent
them
receiving
warning
we
should
at
present
make
no
attack
we
made
further
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
had
been
any
vessel
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
during
the
past
few
days
and
were
informed
that
once
or
twice
a
warship
had
been
seen
on
the
near
side
of
the
southern
horizon
this
was
evidently
the
ship
which
rooke
had
seen
on
his
rush
down
the
coast
after
the
abduction
of
the
voivodin
and
which
he
had
identified
as
a
turkish
vessel
the
glimpses
of
her
which
had
been
had
were
all
in
full
daylightthere
was
no
proof
that
she
had
not
stolen
up
during
the
nighttime
without
lights
but
the
vladika
and
i
were
satisfied
that
the
turkish
vessel
was
watchingwas
in
league
with
both
parties
of
maraudersand
was
intended
to
take
off
any
of
the
strangers
or
their
prey
who
might
reach
ilsin
undetected
it
was
evidently
with
this
view
that
the
kidnappers
of
teuta
had
in
the
first
instance
made
with
all
speed
for
the
south
it
was
only
when
disappointed
there
that
they
headed
up
north
seeking
in
desperation
for
some
chance
of
crossing
the
border
that
ring
of
steel
had
so
far
well
served
its
purpose
i
sent
for
rooke
and
put
the
matter
before
him
he
had
thought
it
out
for
himself
to
the
same
end
as
we
had
his
deduction
was
let
us
keep
the
cordon
and
watch
for
any
signal
from
the
silent
tower
the
turks
will
tire
before
we
shall
i
undertake
to
watch
the
turkish
warship
during
the
night
i
shall
run
down
south
without
lights
and
have
a
look
at
her
even
if
i
have
to
wait
till
the
grey
of
the
dawn
to
do
so
she
may
see
us
but
if
she
does
i
shall
crawl
away
at
such
pace
that
she
shall
not
get
any
idea
of
our
speed
she
will
certainly
come
nearer
before
a
day
is
over
for
be
sure
the
bureau
of
spies
is
kept
advised
and
they
know
that
when
the
country
is
awake
each
day
increases
the
hazard
of
them
and
their
plans
being
discovered
from
their
caution
i
gather
that
they
do
not
court
discovery
and
from
that
that
they
do
not
wish
for
an
open
declaration
of
war
if
this
be
so
why
should
we
not
come
out
to
them
and
force
an
issue
if
need
be
when
teuta
and
i
got
a
chance
to
be
alone
we
discussed
the
situation
in
every
phase
the
poor
girl
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
anxiety
regarding
her
fathers
safety
at
first
she
was
hardly
able
to
speak
or
even
to
think
coherently
her
utterance
was
choked
and
her
reasoning
palsied
with
indignation
but
presently
the
fighting
blood
of
her
race
restored
her
faculties
and
then
her
womans
quick
wit
was
worth
the
reasoning
of
a
camp
full
of
men
seeing
that
she
was
all
on
fire
with
the
subject
i
sat
still
and
waited
taking
care
not
to
interrupt
her
for
quite
a
long
time
she
sat
still
whilst
the
coming
night
thickened
when
she
spoke
the
whole
plan
of
action
based
on
subtle
thinking
had
mapped
itself
out
in
her
mind
we
must
act
quickly
every
hour
increases
the
risk
to
my
father
here
her
voice
broke
for
an
instant
but
she
recovered
herself
and
went
on
if
you
go
to
the
ship
i
must
not
go
with
you
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
be
seen
the
captain
doubtless
knows
of
both
attempts
that
to
carry
me
off
as
well
as
that
against
my
father
as
yet
he
is
in
ignorance
of
what
has
happened
you
and
your
party
of
brave
loyal
men
did
their
work
so
well
that
no
news
could
go
forth
so
long
therefore
as
the
naval
captain
is
ignorant
he
must
delay
till
the
last
but
if
he
saw
me
he
would
know
that
that
branch
of
the
venture
had
miscarried
he
would
gather
from
our
being
here
that
we
had
news
of
my
fathers
capture
and
as
he
would
know
that
the
marauders
would
fail
unless
they
were
relieved
by
force
he
would
order
the
captive
to
be
slain
yes
dear
tomorrow
you
had
perhaps
better
see
the
captain
but
tonight
we
must
try
to
rescue
my
father
here
i
think
i
see
a
way
you
have
your
aeroplane
please
take
me
with
you
into
the
silent
tower
not
for
a
world
of
chrysolite
said
i
horrified
she
took
my
hand
and
held
it
tight
whilst
she
went
on
dear
i
know
i
know
be
satisfied
but
it
is
the
only
way
you
can
i
know
get
there
and
in
the
dark
but
if
you
were
to
go
in
it
it
would
give
warning
to
the
enemies
and
besides
my
father
would
not
understand
remember
he
does
not
know
you
he
has
never
seen
you
and
does
not
i
suppose
even
know
as
yet
of
your
existence
but
he
would
know
me
at
once
and
in
any
dress
you
can
manage
to
lower
me
into
the
tower
by
a
rope
from
the
aeroplane
the
turks
as
yet
do
not
know
of
our
pursuit
and
doubtless
rely
at
all
events
in
part
on
the
strength
and
security
of
the
tower
therefore
their
guard
will
be
less
active
than
it
would
at
first
or
later
on
i
shall
post
father
in
all
details
and
we
shall
be
ready
quickly
now
dear
let
us
think
out
the
scheme
together
let
your
mans
wit
and
experience
help
my
ignorance
and
we
shall
save
my
father
how
could
i
have
resisted
such
pleadingeven
had
it
not
seemed
wise
but
wise
it
was
and
i
who
knew
what
the
aeroplane
could
do
under
my
own
guidance
saw
at
once
the
practicalities
of
the
scheme
of
course
there
was
a
dreadful
risk
in
case
anything
should
go
wrong
but
we
are
at
present
living
in
a
world
of
risksand
her
fathers
life
was
at
stake
so
i
took
my
dear
wife
in
my
arms
and
told
her
that
my
mind
was
hers
for
this
as
my
soul
and
body
already
were
and
i
cheered
her
by
saying
that
i
thought
it
might
be
done
i
sent
for
rooke
and
told
him
of
the
new
adventure
and
he
quite
agreed
with
me
in
the
wisdom
of
it
i
then
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
go
and
interview
the
captain
of
the
turkish
warship
in
the
morning
if
i
did
not
turn
up
i
am
going
to
see
the
vladika
i
said
he
will
lead
our
own
troops
in
the
attack
on
the
silent
tower
but
it
will
rest
with
you
to
deal
with
the
warship
ask
the
captain
to
whom
or
what
nation
the
ship
belongs
he
is
sure
to
refuse
to
tell
in
such
case
mention
to
him
that
if
he
flies
no
nations
flag
his
vessel
is
a
pirate
ship
and
that
you
who
are
in
command
of
the
navy
of
the
blue
mountains
will
deal
with
him
as
a
pirate
is
dealt
withno
quarter
no
mercy
he
will
temporize
and
perhaps
try
a
bluff
but
when
things
get
serious
with
him
he
will
land
a
force
or
try
to
and
may
even
prepare
to
shell
the
town
he
will
threaten
to
at
any
rate
in
such
case
deal
with
him
as
you
think
best
or
as
near
to
it
as
you
can
he
answered
i
shall
carry
out
your
wishes
with
my
life
it
is
a
righteous
task
not
that
anything
of
that
sort
would
ever
stand
in
my
way
if
he
attacks
our
nation
either
as
a
turk
or
a
pirate
i
shall
wipe
him
out
we
shall
see
what
our
own
little
packet
can
do
moreover
any
of
the
marauders
who
have
entered
the
blue
mountains
from
sea
or
otherwise
shall
never
get
out
by
sea
i
take
it
that
we
of
my
contingent
shall
cover
the
attacking
party
it
will
be
a
sorry
time
for
us
all
if
that
happens
without
our
seeing
you
and
the
voivodin
for
in
such
case
we
shall
understand
the
worst
iron
as
he
was
the
man
trembled
that
is
so
rooke
i
said
we
are
taking
a
desperate
chance
we
know
but
the
case
is
desperate
but
we
all
have
our
duty
to
do
whatever
happens
ours
and
yours
is
stern
but
when
we
have
done
it
the
result
will
be
that
life
will
be
easier
for
othersfor
those
that
are
left
before
he
left
i
asked
him
to
send
up
to
me
three
suits
of
the
masterman
bulletproof
clothes
of
which
we
had
a
supply
on
the
yacht
two
are
for
the
voivodin
and
myself
i
said
the
third
is
for
the
voivode
to
put
on
the
voivodin
will
take
it
with
her
when
she
descends
from
the
aeroplane
into
the
tower
whilst
any
daylight
was
left
i
went
out
to
survey
the
ground
my
wife
wanted
to
come
with
me
but
i
would
not
let
her
no
said
i
you
will
have
at
the
best
a
fearful
tax
on
your
strength
and
your
nerves
you
will
want
to
be
as
fresh
as
is
possible
when
you
get
on
the
aeroplane
like
a
good
wife
she
obeyed
and
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
little
tent
provided
for
her
i
took
with
me
a
local
man
who
knew
the
ground
and
who
was
trusted
to
be
silent
we
made
a
long
detour
when
we
had
got
as
near
the
silent
tower
as
we
could
without
being
noticed
i
made
notes
from
my
compass
as
to
directions
and
took
good
notice
of
anything
that
could
possibly
serve
as
a
landmark
by
the
time
we
got
home
i
was
pretty
well
satisfied
that
if
all
should
go
well
i
could
easily
sail
over
the
tower
in
the
dark
then
i
had
a
talk
with
my
wife
and
gave
her
full
instructions
when
we
arrive
over
the
tower
i
said
i
shall
lower
you
with
a
long
rope
you
will
have
a
parcel
of
food
and
spirit
for
your
father
in
case
he
is
fatigued
or
faint
and
of
course
the
bulletproof
suit
which
he
must
put
on
at
once
you
will
also
have
a
short
rope
with
a
belt
at
either
endone
for
your
father
the
other
for
you
when
i
turn
the
aeroplane
and
come
back
again
you
will
have
ready
the
ring
which
lies
midway
between
the
belts
this
you
will
catch
into
the
hook
at
the
end
of
the
lowered
rope
when
all
is
secure
and
i
have
pulled
you
both
up
by
the
windlass
so
as
to
clear
the
top
i
shall
throw
out
ballast
which
we
shall
carry
on
purpose
and
away
we
go
i
am
sorry
it
must
be
so
uncomfortable
for
you
both
but
there
is
no
other
way
when
we
get
well
clear
of
the
tower
i
shall
take
you
both
up
on
the
platform
if
necessary
i
shall
descend
to
do
itand
then
we
shall
steer
for
ilsin
when
all
is
safe
our
men
will
attack
the
tower
we
must
let
them
do
it
for
they
expect
it
a
few
men
in
the
clothes
and
arms
which
we
took
from
your
captors
will
be
pursued
by
some
of
ours
it
is
all
arranged
they
will
ask
the
turks
to
admit
them
and
if
the
latter
have
not
learned
of
your
fathers
escape
perhaps
they
will
do
so
once
in
our
men
will
try
to
open
the
gate
the
chances
are
against
them
poor
fellows
but
they
are
all
volunteers
and
will
die
fighting
if
they
win
out
great
glory
will
be
theirs
the
moon
does
not
rise
tonight
till
just
before
midnight
so
we
have
plenty
of
time
we
shall
start
from
here
at
ten
if
all
be
well
i
shall
place
you
in
the
tower
with
your
father
in
less
than
a
quarterhour
from
that
a
few
minutes
will
suffice
to
clothe
him
in
bulletproof
and
get
on
his
belt
i
shall
not
be
away
from
the
tower
more
than
a
very
few
minutes
and
please
god
long
before
eleven
we
shall
be
safe
then
the
tower
can
be
won
in
an
attack
by
our
mountaineers
perhaps
when
the
guns
are
heard
on
the
ship
of
warfor
there
is
sure
to
be
firingthe
captain
may
try
to
land
a
shore
party
but
rooke
will
stand
in
the
way
and
if
i
know
the
man
and
the
lady
we
shall
not
be
troubled
with
many
turks
tonight
by
midnight
you
and
your
father
can
be
on
the
way
to
vissarion
i
can
interview
the
naval
captain
in
the
morning
my
wifes
marvellous
courage
and
selfpossession
stood
to
her
at
half
an
hour
before
the
time
fixed
she
was
ready
for
our
adventure
she
had
improved
the
scheme
in
one
detail
she
had
put
on
her
own
belt
and
coiled
the
rope
round
her
waist
so
the
only
delay
would
be
in
bringing
her
fathers
belt
she
would
keep
the
bulletproof
dress
intended
to
be
his
strapped
in
a
packet
on
her
back
so
that
if
occasion
should
be
favourable
he
would
not
want
to
put
it
on
till
he
and
she
should
have
reached
the
platform
of
the
aeroplane
in
such
case
i
should
not
steer
away
from
the
tower
at
all
but
would
pass
slowly
across
it
and
take
up
the
captive
and
his
brave
daughter
before
leaving
i
had
learned
from
local
sources
that
the
tower
was
in
several
stories
entrance
was
by
the
foot
where
the
great
ironclad
door
was
then
came
livingrooms
and
storage
and
an
open
space
at
the
top
this
would
probably
be
thought
the
best
place
for
the
prisoner
for
it
was
deepsunk
within
the
massive
walls
wherein
was
no
loophole
of
any
kind
this
if
it
should
so
happen
would
be
the
disposition
of
things
best
for
our
plan
the
guards
would
at
this
time
be
all
inside
the
towerprobably
resting
most
of
themso
that
it
was
possible
that
no
one
might
notice
the
coming
of
the
airship
i
was
afraid
to
think
that
all
might
turn
out
so
well
for
in
such
case
our
task
would
be
a
simple
enough
one
and
would
in
all
human
probability
be
crowned
with
success
at
ten
oclock
we
started
teuta
did
not
show
the
smallest
sign
of
fear
or
even
uneasiness
though
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
even
seen
an
aeroplane
at
work
she
proved
to
be
an
admirable
passenger
for
an
airship
she
stayed
quite
still
holding
herself
rigidly
in
the
position
arranged
by
the
cords
which
i
had
fixed
for
her
when
i
had
trued
my
course
by
the
landmarks
and
with
the
compass
lit
by
the
tiny
my
electric
light
in
the
dark
box
i
had
time
to
look
about
me
all
seemed
quite
dark
wherever
i
lookedto
land
or
sea
or
sky
but
darkness
is
relative
and
though
each
quarter
and
spot
looked
dark
in
turn
there
was
not
such
absolute
darkness
as
a
whole
i
could
tell
the
difference
for
instance
between
land
and
sea
no
matter
how
far
off
we
might
be
from
either
looking
upward
the
sky
was
dark
yet
there
was
light
enough
to
see
and
even
distinguish
broad
effects
i
had
no
difficulty
in
distinguishing
the
tower
towards
which
we
were
moving
and
that
after
all
was
the
main
thing
we
drifted
slowly
very
slowly
as
the
air
was
still
and
i
only
used
the
minimum
pressure
necessary
for
the
engine
i
think
i
now
understood
for
the
first
time
the
extraordinary
value
of
the
engine
with
which
my
kitson
was
equipped
it
was
noiseless
it
was
practically
of
no
weight
and
it
allowed
the
machine
to
progress
as
easily
as
the
oldfashioned
balloon
used
to
drift
before
a
breeze
teuta
who
had
naturally
very
fine
sight
seemed
to
see
even
better
than
i
did
for
as
we
drew
nearer
to
the
tower
and
its
round
open
top
began
to
articulate
itself
she
commenced
to
prepare
for
her
part
of
the
task
she
it
was
who
uncoiled
the
long
dragrope
ready
for
her
lowering
we
were
proceeding
so
gently
that
she
as
well
as
i
had
hopes
that
i
might
be
able
to
actually
balance
the
machine
on
the
top
of
the
curving
walla
thing
manifestly
impossible
on
a
straight
surface
though
it
might
have
been
possible
on
an
angle
on
we
crepton
and
on
there
was
no
sign
of
light
about
the
tower
and
not
the
faintest
sound
to
be
heard
till
we
were
almost
close
to
the
line
of
the
rising
wall
then
we
heard
a
sound
of
something
like
mirth
but
muffled
by
distance
and
thick
walls
from
it
we
took
fresh
heart
for
it
told
us
that
our
enemies
were
gathered
in
the
lower
chambers
if
only
the
voivode
should
be
on
the
upper
stage
all
would
be
well
slowly
almost
inch
by
inch
and
with
a
suspense
that
was
agonizing
we
crossed
some
twenty
or
thirty
feet
above
the
top
of
the
wall
i
could
see
as
we
came
near
the
jagged
line
of
white
patches
where
the
heads
of
the
massacred
turks
placed
there
on
spikes
in
old
days
seemed
to
give
still
their
grim
warning
seeing
that
they
made
in
themselves
a
difficulty
of
landing
on
the
wall
i
deflected
the
plane
so
that
as
we
crept
over
the
wall
we
might
if
they
became
displaced
brush
them
to
the
outside
of
the
wall
a
few
seconds
more
and
i
was
able
to
bring
the
machine
to
rest
with
the
front
of
the
platform
jutting
out
beyond
the
tower
wall
here
i
anchored
her
fore
and
aft
with
clamps
which
had
been
already
prepared
whilst
i
was
doing
so
teuta
had
leaned
over
the
inner
edge
of
the
platform
and
whispered
as
softly
as
the
sigh
of
a
gentle
breeze
hist
hist
the
answer
came
in
a
similar
sound
from
some
twenty
feet
below
us
and
we
knew
that
the
prisoner
was
alone
forthwith
having
fixed
the
hook
of
the
rope
in
the
ring
to
which
was
attached
her
belt
i
lowered
my
wife
her
father
evidently
knew
her
whisper
and
was
ready

hollow

were

have

it
will
be
easier
for

to
lift

to
the

yes
i
shall
explain
later
quick

there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
he
is
enormously
strong
and
can
lift
us
together
but
we
must
help
him
by
being
still
so
he
wont
have
to
use
the
windlass
which
might
creak
as
she
spoke
she
jerked
slightly
at
the
rope
which
was
our
preconcerted
signal
that
i
was
to
lift
i
was
afraid
the
windlass
might
creak
and
her
thoughtful
hint
decided
me
i
bent
my
back
to
the
task
and
in
a
few
seconds
they
were
on
the
platform
on
which
they
at
teutas
suggestion
lay
flat
one
at
each
side
of
my
seat
so
as
to
keep
the
best
balance
possible
i
took
off
the
clamps
lifted
the
bags
of
ballast
to
the
top
of
the
wall
so
that
there
should
be
no
sound
of
falling
and
started
the
engine
the
machine
moved
forward
a
few
inches
so
that
it
tilted
towards
the
outside
of
the
wall
i
threw
my
weight
on
the
front
part
of
the
platform
and
we
commenced
our
downward
fall
at
a
sharp
angle
a
second
enlarged
the
angle
and
without
further
ado
we
slid
away
into
the
darkness
then
ascending
as
we
went
when
the
engine
began
to
work
at
its
strength
we
turned
and
presently
made
straight
for
ilsin
the
journey
was
shortnot
many
minutes
it
almost
seemed
as
if
no
time
whatever
had
elapsed
till
we
saw
below
us
the
gleam
of
lights
and
by
them
saw
a
great
body
of
men
gathered
in
military
array
we
slackened
and
descended
the
crowd
kept
deathly
silence
but
when
we
were
amongst
them
we
needed
no
telling
that
it
was
not
due
to
lack
of
heart
or
absence
of
joy
the
pressure
of
their
hands
as
they
surrounded
us
and
the
devotion
with
which
they
kissed
the
hands
and
feet
of
both
the
voivode
and
his
daughter
were
evidence
enough
for
me
even
had
i
not
had
my
own
share
of
their
grateful
rejoicing
in
the
midst
of
it

low

1907
i
had
little
idea
when
i
started
on
my
homeward
journey
that
it
would
have
such
a
strange
termination
even
i
who
ever
since
my
boyhood
have
lived
in
a
whirl
of
adventure
intrigue
or
diplomacywhichever
it
may
be
calledstatecraft
and
war
had
reason
to
be
surprised
i
certainly
thought
that
when
i
locked
myself
into
my
room
in
the
hotel
at
ilsin
that
i
would
have
at
last
a
spell
however
short
of
quiet
all
the
time
of
my
prolonged
negotiations
with
the
various
nationalities
i
had
to
be
at
tension
so
too
on
my
homeward
journey
lest
something
at
the
last
moment
should
happen
adversely
to
my
mission
but
when
i
was
safe
on
my
own
land
of
the
blue
mountains
and
laid
my
head
on
my
pillow
where
only
friends
could
be
around
me
i
thought
i
might
forget
care
but
to
wake
with
a
rude
hand
over
my
mouth
and
to
feel
myself
grasped
tight
by
so
many
hands
that
i
could
not
move
a
limb
was
a
dreadful
shock
all
after
that
was
like
a
dreadful
dream
i
was
rolled
in
a
great
rug
so
tightly
that
i
could
hardly
breathe
let
alone
cry
out
lifted
by
many
hands
through
the
window
which
i
could
hear
was
softly
opened
and
shut
for
the
purpose
and
carried
to
a
boat
again
lifted
into
some
sort
of
litter
on
which
i
was
borne
a
long
distance
but
with
considerable
rapidity
again
lifted
out
and
dragged
through
a
doorway
opened
on
purposei
could
hear
the
clang
as
it
was
shut
behind
me
then
the
rug
was
removed
and
i
found
myself
still
in
my
nightgear
in
the
midst
of
a
ring
of
men
there
were
two
score
of
them
all
turks
all
stronglooking
resolute
men
armed
to
the
teeth
my
clothes
which
had
been
taken
from
my
room
were
thrown
down
beside
me
and
i
was
told
to
dress
as
the
turks
were
going
from
the
roomshaped
like
a
vaultwhere
we
then
were
the
last
of
them
who
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
officer
said
if
you
cry
out
or
make
any
noise
whatever
whilst
you
are
in
this
tower
you
shall
die
before
your
time
presently
some
food
and
water
were
brought
me
and
a
couple
of
blankets
i
wrapped
myself
up
and
slept
till
early
in
the
morning
breakfast
was
brought
and
the
same
men
filed
in
in
the
presence
of
them
all
the
same
officer
said
i
have
given
instructions
that
if
you
make
any
noise
or
betray
your
presence
to
anyone
outside
this
tower
the
nearest
man
is
to
restore
you
to
immediate
quiet
with
his
yataghan
it
you
promise
me
that
you
will
remain
quiet
whilst
you
are
within
the
tower
i
can
enlarge
your
liberties
somewhat
do
you
promise
i
promised
as
he
wished
there
was
no
need
to
make
necessary
any
stricter
measure
of
confinement
any
chance
of
escape
lay
in
having
the
utmost
freedom
allowed
to
me
although
i
had
been
taken
away
with
such
secrecy
i
knew
that
before
long
there
would
be
pursuit
so
i
waited
with
what
patience
i
could
i
was
allowed
to
go
on
the
upper
platforma
consideration
due
i
am
convinced
to
my
captors
wish
for
their
own
comfort
rather
than
for
mine
it
was
not
very
cheering
for
during
the
daytime
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
even
a
younger
and
more
active
man
than
i
am
to
climb
the
walls
they
were
built
for
prison
purposes
and
a
cat
could
not
find
entry
for
its
claws
between
the
stones
i
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
as
well
as
i
could
wrapping
my
blanket
round
me
i
lay
down
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
i
wished
to
see
it
whilst
i
could
i
was
just
dropping
to
sleepthe
unutterable
silence
of
the
place
broken
only
now
and
again
by
some
remark
by
my
captors
in
the
rooms
below
mewhen
there
was
a
strange
appearance
just
over
mean
appearance
so
strange
that
i
sat
up
and
gazed
with
distended
eyes
across
the
top
of
the
tower
some
height
above
drifted
slowly
and
silently
a
great
platform
although
the
night
was
dark
it
was
so
much
darker
where
i
was
within
the
hollow
of
the
tower
that
i
could
actually
see
what
was
above
me
i
knew
it
was
an
aeroplaneone
of
which
i
had
seen
in
washington
a
man
was
seated
in
the
centre
steering
and
beside
him
was
a
silent
figure
of
a
woman
all
wrapped
in
white
it
made
my
heart
beat
to
see
her
for
she
was
figured
something
like
my
teuta
but
broader
less
shapely
she
leaned
over
and
a
whispered
ssh
crept
down
to
me
i
answered
in
similar
way
whereupon
she
rose
and
the
man
lowered
her
down
into
the
tower
then
i
saw
that
it
was
my
dear
daughter
who
had
come
in
this
wonderful
way
to
save
me
with
infinite
haste
she
helped
me
to
fasten
round
my
waist
a
belt
attached
to
a
rope
which
was
coiled
round
her
and
then
the
man
who
was
a
giant
in
strength
as
well
as
stature
raised
us
both
to
the
platform
of
the
aeroplane
which
he
set
in
motion
without
an
instants
delay
within
a
few
seconds
and
without
any
discovery
being
made
of
my
escape
we
were
speeding
towards
the
sea
the
lights
of
ilsin
were
in
front
of
us
before
reaching
the
town
however
we
descended
in
the
midst
of
a
little
army
of
my
own
people
who
were
gathered
ready
to
advance
upon
the
silent
tower
there
to
effect
if
necessary
my
rescue
by
force
small
chance
would
there
have
been
of
my
life
in
case
of
such
a
struggle
happily
however
the
devotion
and
courage
of
my
dear
daughter
and
of
her
gallant
companion
prevented
such
a
necessity
it
was
strange
to
me
to
find
such
joyous
reception
amongst
my
friends
expressed
in
such
a
whispered
silence
there
was
no
time
for
comment
or
understanding
or
the
asking
of
questionsi
was
fain
to
take
things
as
they
stood
and
wait
for
fuller
explanation
this
came
later
when
my
daughter
and
i
were
able
to
converse
alone
when
the
expedition
went
out
against
the
silent
tower
teuta
and
i
went
to
her
tent
and
with
us
came
her
gigantic
companion
who
seemed
not
wearied
but
almost
overcome
with
sleep
when
we
came
into
the
tent
over
which
at
a
little
distance
a
cordon
of
our
mountaineers
stood
on
guard
he
said
to
me
may
i
ask
you
sir
to
pardon
me
for
a
time
and
allow
the
voivodin
to
explain
matters
to
you
she
will
i
know
so
far
assist
me
for
there
is
so
much
work
still
to
be
done
before
we
are
free
of
the
present
peril
for
myself
i
am
almost
overcome
with
sleep
for
three
nights
i
have
had
no
sleep
but
all
during
that
time
much
labour
and
more
anxiety
i
could
hold
on
longer
but
at
daybreak
i
must
go
out
to
the
turkish
warship
that
lies
in
the
offing
she
is
a
turk
though
she
does
not
confess
to
it
and
she
it
is
who
has
brought
hither
the
marauders
who
captured
both
your
daughter
and
yourself
it
is
needful
that
i
go
for
i
hold
a
personal
authority
from
the
national
council
to
take
whatever
step
may
be
necessary
for
our
protection
and
when
i
go
i
should
be
clearheaded
for
war
may
rest
on
that
meeting
i
shall
be
in
the
adjoining
tent
and
shall
come
at
once
if
i
am
summoned
in
case
you
wish
for
me
before
dawn
here
my
daughter
struck
in
father
ask
him
to
remain
here
we
shall
not
disturb
him
i
am
sure
in
our
talking
and
moreover
if
you
knew
how
much
i
owe
to
himto
his
own
bravery
and
his
strengthyou
would
understand
how
much
safer
i
feel
when
he
is
close
to
me
though
we
are
surrounded
by
an
army
of
our
brave
mountaineers
but
my
daughter
i
said
for
i
was
as
yet
all
in
ignorance
there
are
confidences
between
father
and
daughter
which
none
other
may
share
some
of
what
has
been
i
know
but
i
want
to
know
all
and
it
might
be
better
that
no
strangerhowever
valiant
he
may
be
or
no
matter
in
what
measure
we
are
bound
to
himshould
be
present
to
my
astonishment
she
who
had
always
been
amenable
to
my
lightest
wish
actually
argued
with
me
father
there
are
other
confidences
which
have
to
be
respected
in
like
wise
bear
with
me
dear
till
i
have
told
you
all
and
i
am
right
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
me
i
ask
it
father
that
settled
the
matter
and
as
i
could
see
that
the
gallant
gentleman
who
had
rescued
me
was
swaying
on
his
feet
as
he
waited
respectfully
i
said
to
him
rest
with
us
sir
we
shall
watch
over
your
sleep
then
i
had
to
help
him
for
almost
on
the
instant
he
sank
down
and
i
had
to
guide
him
to
the
rugs
spread
on
the
ground
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
in
a
deep
sleep
as
i
stood
looking
at
him
till
i
had
realized
that
he
vas
really
asleep
i
could
not
help
marvelling
at
the
bounty
of
nature
that
could
uphold
even
such
a
man
as
this
to
the
last
moment
of
work
to
be
done
and
then
allow
so
swift
a
collapse
when
all
was
over
and
he
could
rest
peacefully
he
was
certainly
a
splendid
fellow
i
think
i
never
saw
so
fine
a
man
physically
in
my
life
and
if
the
lesson
of
his
physiognomy
be
true
he
is
as
sterling
inwardly
as
his
external
is
fair
now
said
i
to
teuta
we
are
to
all
intents
quite
alone
tell
me
all
that
has
been
so
that
i
may
understand
whereupon
my
daughter
making
me
sit
down
knelt
beside
me
and
told
me
from
end
to
end
the
most
marvellous
story
i
had
ever
heard
or
read
of
something
of
it
i
had
already
known
from
the
archbishop
paleologues
later
letters
but
of
all
else
i
was
ignorant
far
away
in
the
great
west
beyond
the
atlantic
and
again
on
the
fringe
of
the
eastern
seas
i
had
been
thrilled
to
my
hearts
core
by
the
heroic
devotion
and
fortitude
of
my
daughter
in
yielding
herself
for
her
countrys
sake
to
that
fearful
ordeal
of
the
crypt
of
the
grief
of
the
nation
at
her
reported
death
news
of
which
was
so
mercifully
and
wisely
withheld
from
me
as
long
as
possible
of
the
supernatural
rumours
that
took
root
so
deep
but
no
word
or
hint
had
come
to
me
of
a
man
who
had
come
across
the
orbit
of
her
life
much
less
of
all
that
has
resulted
from
it
neither
had
i
known
of
her
being
carried
off
or
of
the
thrice
gallant
rescue
of
her
by
rupert
little
wonder
that
i
thought
so
highly
of
him
even
at
the
first
moment
i
had
a
clear
view
of
him
when
he
sank
down
to
sleep
before
me
why
the
man
must
be
a
marvel
even
our
mountaineers
could
not
match
such
endurance
as
his
in
the
course
of
her
narrative
my
daughter
told
me
of
how
being
wearied
with
her
long
waiting
in
the
tomb
and
waking
to
find
herself
alone
when
the
floods
were
out
and
even
the
crypt
submerged
she
sought
safety
and
warmth
elsewhere
and
how
she
came
to
the
castle
in
the
night
and
found
the
strange
man
alone
i
said
that
was
dangerous
daughter
if
not
wrong
the
man
brave
and
devoted
as
he
is
must
answer
meyour
father
at
that
she
was
greatly
upset
and
before
going
on
with
her
narrative
drew
me
close
in
her
arms
and
whispered
to
me
be
gentle
to
me
father
for
i
have
had
much
to
bear
and
be
good
to
him
for
he
holds
my
heart
in
his
breast
i
reassured
her
with
a
gentle
pressurethere
was
no
need
to
speak
she
then
went
on
to
tell
me
about
her
marriage
and
how
her
husband
who
had
fallen
into
the
belief
that
she
was
a
vampire
had
determined
to
give
even
his
soul
for
her
and
how
she
had
on
the
night
of
the
marriage
left
him
and
gone
back
to
the
tomb
to
play
to
the
end
the
grim
comedy
which
she
had
undertaken
to
perform
till
my
return
and
how
on
the
second
night
after
her
marriage
as
she
was
in
the
garden
of
the
castlegoing
as
she
shyly
told
me
to
see
if
all
was
well
with
her
husbandshe
was
seized
secretly
muffled
up
bound
and
carried
off
here
she
made
a
pause
and
a
digression
evidently
some
fear
lest
her
husband
and
myself
should
quarrel
assailed
her
for
she
said
do
understand
father
that
ruperts
marriage
to
me
was
in
all
ways
regular
and
quite
in
accord
with
our
customs
before
we
were
married
i
told
the
archbishop
of
my
wish
he
as
your
representative
during
your
absence
consented
himself
and
brought
the
matter
to
the
notice
of
the
vladika
and
the
archimandrites
all
these
concurred
having
exacted
from
mevery
properly
i
thinka
sacred
promise
to
adhere
to
my
selfappointed
task
the
marriage
itself
was
orthodox
in
all
waysthough
so
far
unusual
that
it
was
held
at
night
and
in
darkness
save
for
the
lights
appointed
by
the
ritual
as
to
that
the
archbishop
himself
or
the
archimandrite
of
spazac
who
assisted
him
or
the
vladika
who
acted
as
paranymph
will
all
or
any
of
them
give
you
full
details
your
representative
made
all
inquiries
as
to
rupert
sent
leger
who
lived
in
vissarion
though
he
did
not
know
who
i
was
or
from
his
point
of
view
who
i
had
been
but
i
must
tell
you
of
my
rescue
and
so
she
went
on
to
tell
me
of
that
unavailing
journey
south
by
her
captors
of
their
bafflement
by
the
cordon
which
rupert
had
established
at
the
first
word
of
danger
to
the
daughter
of
our
leader
though
he
little
knew
who
the
leader
was
or
who
was
his
daughter
of
how
the
brutal
marauders
tortured
her
to
speed
with
their
daggers
and
how
her
wounds
left
bloodmarks
on
the
ground
as
she
passed
along
then
of
the
halt
in
the
valley
when
the
marauders
came
to
know
that
their
road
north
was
menaced
if
not
already
blocked
of
the
choosing
of
the
murderers
and
their
keeping
ward
over
her
whilst
their
companions
went
to
survey
the
situation
and
of
her
gallant
rescue
by
that
noble
fellow
her
husbandmy
son
i
shall
call
him
henceforth
and
thank
god
that
i
may
have
that
happiness
and
that
honour
then
my
daughter
went
on
to
tell
me
of
the
race
back
to
vissarion
when
rupert
went
ahead
of
allas
a
leader
should
do
of
the
summoning
of
the
archbishop
and
the
national

of
their
placing

knew
as
she
finished
the
sleeping

stirred
and
wokebroad
awake
in
a
secondsure
sign
of
a
man
accustomed
to
campaign
and
adventure
at
a
glance
he
recalled
everything
that
had
been
and
sprang
to
his
feet
he
stood
respectfully
before
me
for
a
few
seconds
before
speaking
then
he
said
with
an
open
engaging
smile
i
see
sir
you
know
all
am
i
forgivenfor
teutas
sake
as
well
as
my
own
by
this
time
i
was
also
on
my
feet
a
man
like
that
walks
straight
into
my
heart
my
daughter
too
had
risen
and
stood
by
my
side
i
put
out
my
hand
and
grasped
his
which
seemed
to
leap
to
meet
meas
only
the
hand
of
a
swordsman
can
do
i
am
glad
you
are
my
son
i
said
it
was
all
i
could
say
and
i
meant
it
and
all
it
implied
we
shook
hands
warmly
teuta
was
pleased
she
kissed
me
and
then
stood
holding
my
arm
with
one
hand
whilst
she
linked
her
other
hand
in
the
arm
of
her
husband
he
summoned
one
of
the
sentries
without
and
told
him
to
ask
captain
rooke
to
come
to
him
the
latter
had
been
ready
for
a
call
and
came
at
once
when
through
the
open
flap
of
the
tent
we
saw
him
coming
rupertas
i
must
call
him
now
because
teuta
wishes
it
and
i
like
to
do
it
myselfsaid
i
must
be
off
to
board
the
turkish
vessel
before
it
comes
inshore
goodbye
sir
in
case
we
do
not
meet
again
he
said
the
last
few
words
in
so
low
a
voice
that
i
only
could
hear
them
then
he
kissed
his
wife
and
told
her
he
expected
to
be
back
in
time
for
breakfast
and
was
gone
he
met
rookei
am
hardly
accustomed
to
call
him
captain
as
yet
though
indeed
he
well
deserves
itat
the
edge
of
the
cordon
of
sentries
and
they
went
quickly
together
towards
the
port
where
the
yacht
was
lying
with
steam

1907
when
the
gospodar
rupert
and
captain
rooke
came
within
hailing
distance
of
the
strange
ship
the
former
hailed
her
using
one
after
another
the

of
england
germany
france

turkey
greece
spain
portugal
and
another
which
i
did
not

i
think
it
must
have
been
american
by
this
time
the
whole
line
of
the
bulwark
was
covered
by
a
row
of
turkish
faces
when
in
turkish
the
gospodar
asked
for
the
captain
the
latter
came
to
the
gangway
which
had
been
opened
and
stood
there
his
uniform
was
that
of
the
turkish
navyof
that
i
am
prepared
to
swearbut
he
made
signs
of
not
understanding
what
had
been
said
whereupon
the
gospodar
spoke
again
but
in
french
this
time
i
append
the
exact
conversation
which
took
place
none
other
joining
in
it
i
took
down
in
shorthand
the
words
of
both
as
they
were
spoken
the
gospodar
are

bound
to
say
in
manner
most
courteous
as

some
command
to
his
officers
whereupon
the
companionladders
and
stage
were
lowered
and
the
gangway
manned

is
usual
for

me
with

and
rowed
to
the
warship
where
we
were
all
honourably
received
there
were
an
immense
number
of
men
on
board
soldiers
as
well
as
seamen
it
looked
more
like
a
warlike
expedition
than
a
fightingship
in
time
of
peace
as
we
stepped
on
the
deck
the
seamen
and
marines
who
were
all
armed
as
at
drill
presented

the
gospodar
went
first
towards
the
captain
and
captain
rooke
and
i
followed
close
behind
him
the
gospodar
spoke

residing
at

empowered
to
act
for
the
national
council
in
all
matters
here
is
my
credential
as
he
spoke
he
handed
to
the
captain
a
letter
it
was
written
in
five
different
languagesbalkan
turkish
greek
english
and
french
the
captain
read
it
carefully
all
through
forgetful
for
the
moment
that
he
had
seemingly
been
unable
to
understand
the
gospodars
question
spoken
in
the
turkish
tongue
then
he
answered
i
see
the
document
is
complete
may
i
ask
on
what
subject
you
wish
to
see
me
gospodar
you
are
here
in
a
ship
of
war
in
blue
mountain
waters
yet
you
fly
no
flag
of
any
nation
you
have
sent
armed
men
ashore
in
your
boats
thus
committing
an
act
of
war
the
national
council
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
requires
to
know
what
nation
you
serve
and
why
the
obligations
of
international
law
are
thus
broken
the
captain
seemed
to
wait
for
further
speech
but
the
gospodar
remained
silent
whereupon
the
former
spoke
captain
i
am
responsible
to
my
ownchiefs
i
refuse
to
answer
your
question
the
gospodar
spoke
at
once
in
reply
gospodar
then
sir
you
as
commander
of
a
shipand
especially
a
ship
of
warmust
know
that
in
thus
violating
national
and
maritime
laws
you
and
all
on
board
this
ship
are
guilty
of
an
act
of
piracy
this
is
not
even
piracy
on
the
high
seas
you
are
not
merely
within
territorial
waters
but
you
have
invaded
a
national
port
as
you
refuse
to
disclose
the
nationality
of
your
ship
i
accept
as
you
seem
to
do
your
status
as
that
of
a
pirate
and
shall
in
due
season
act
accordingly
captain
with
manifest
hostility
i
accept
the
responsibility
of
my
own
acts
without
admitting
your
contention
i
tell
you
now
that
whatever
action
you
take
shall
be
at
your
own
peril
and
that
of
your
national
council
moreover
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
my
men
who
were
sent
ashore
on
special
service
have
been
beleaguered
in
a
tower
which
can
be
seen
from
the
ship
before
dawn
this
morning
firing
was
heard
from
that
direction
from
which
i
gather
that
attack
was
made
on
them
they
being
only
a
small
party
may
have
been
murdered
if
such
be
so
i
tell
you
that
you
and
your
miserable
little
nation
as
you
call
it
shall
pay
such
bloodmoney
as
you
never
thought
of
i
am
responsible
for
this
and
by
allah
there
shall
be
a
great
revenge
you

not
in
all
your

minutes

bring

in

1907
when
we
turned
shoreward
after
my
stormy
interview
with
the
pirate
captaini
can
call
him
nothing
else
at
present
rooke
gave
orders
to
a
quartermaster
on
the
bridge
and
the
lady
began
to
make
to
a
little
northward
of
ilsin
port
rooke
himself
went
aft
to
the
wheelhouse
taking
several
men
with
him
when
we
were
quite
near
the
rocksthe
water
is
so
deep
here
that
there
is
no
dangerwe
slowed
down
merely
drifting
along
southwards
towards
the
port
i
was
myself
on
the
bridge
and
could
see
all
over
the
decks
i
could
also
see
preparations
going
on
upon
the
warship
ports
were
opened
and
the
great
guns
on
the
turrets
were
lowered
for
action
when
we
were
starboard
broadside
on
to
the
warship
i
saw
the
port
side
of
the
steeringhouse
open
and
rookes
men
sliding
out
what
looked
like
a
huge
grey
crab
which
by
tackle
from
within
the
wheelhouse
was
lowered
softly
into
the
sea
the
position
of
the
yacht
hid
the
operation
from
sight
of
the
warship
the
doors
were
shut
again
and
the
yachts
pace
began
to
quicken
we
ran
into
the
port
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
rooke
had
some
desperate
project
on
hand
not
for
nothing
had
he
kept
the
wheelhouse
locked
on
that
mysterious
crab
all
along
the
frontage
was
a
great
crowd
of
eager
men
but
they
had
considerately
left
the
little
mole
at
the
southern
entrance
whereon
was
a
little
tower
on
whose
round
top
a
signalgun
was
placed
free
for
my
own
use
when
i
was
landed
on
this
pier
i
went
along
to
the
end
and
climbing
the
narrow
stair
within
went
out
on
the
sloping
roof
i
stood
up
for
i
was
determined
to
show
the
turks
that
i
was
not
afraid
for
myself
as
they
would
understand
when
the
bombardment
should
begin
it
was
now
but
a
very
few
minutes
before
the
fatal
hoursix
bells
but
all
the
same
i
was
almost
in
a
state
of
despair
it
was
terrible
to
think
of
all
those
poor
souls
in
the
town
who
had
done
nothing
wrong
and
who
were
to
be
wiped
out
in
the
coming
bloodthirsty
wanton
attack
i
raised
my
glasses
to
see
how
preparations
were
going
on
upon
the
warship
as
i
looked
i
had
a
momentary
fear
that
my
eyesight
was
giving
way
at
one
moment
i
had
the
deck
of
the
warship
focussed
with
my
glasses
and
could
see
every
detail
as
the
gunners
waited
for
the
word
to
begin
the
bombardment
with
the
great
guns
of
the
barbettes
the
next
i
saw
nothing
but
the
empty
sea
then
in
another
instant
there
was
the
ship
as
before
but
the
details
were
blurred
i
steadied
myself
against
the
signalgun
and
looked
again
not
more
than
two
or
at
the
most
three
seconds
had
elapsed
the
ship
was
for
the
moment
full
in
view
as
i
looked
she
gave
a
queer
kind
of
quick
shiver
prow
and
stern
and
then
sideways
it
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
rat
shaken
in
the
mouth
of
a
skilled
terrier
then
she
remained
still
the
one
placid
thing
to
be
seen
for
all
around
her
the
sea
seemed
to
shiver
in
little
independent
eddies
as
when
water
is
broken
without
a
current
to
guide
it
i
continued
to
look
and
when
the
deck
was
or
seemed
quite
stillfor
the
shivering
water
round
the
ship
kept
catching
my
eyes
through
the
outer
rays
of
the
lensesi
noticed
that
nothing
was
stirring
the
men
who
had
been
at
the
guns
were
all
lying
down
the
men
in
the
fightingtops
had
leaned
forward
or
backward
and
their
arms
hung
down
helplessly
everywhere
was
desolationin
so
far
as
life
was
concerned
even
a
little
brown
bear
which
had
been
seated
on
the
cannon
which
was
being
put
into
range
position
had
jumped
or
fallen
on
deck
and
lay
there
stretched
outand
still
it
was
evident
that
some
terrible
shock
had
been
given
to
the
mighty
warvessel
without
a
doubt
or
a
thought
why
i
did
so
i
turned
my
eyes
towards
where
the
lady
lay
port
broadside
now
to
the
inside
in
the
harbour
mouth
i
had
the
key
now
to
the
mystery
of
rookes
proceedings
with
the
great
grey
crab
as
i
looked
i
saw
just
outside
the
harbour
a
thin
line
of
cleaving
water
this
became
more
marked
each
instant
till
a
steel
disc
with
glass
eyes
that
shone
in
the
light
of
the
sun
rose
above
the
water
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
beehive
and
was
shaped
like
one
it
made
a
straight
line
for
the
aft
of
the
yacht
at
the
same
moment
in
obedience
to
some
command
given
so
quietly
that
i
did
not
hear
it
the
men
went
belowall
save
some
few
who
began
to
open
out
doors
in
the
port
side
of
the
wheelhouse
the
tackle
was
run
out
through
an
opened
gangway
on
that
side
and
a
man
stood
on
the
great
hook
at
the
lower
end
balancing
himself
by
hanging
on
the
chain
in
a
few
seconds
he
came
up
again
the
chain
tightened
and
the
great
grey
crab
rose
over
the
edge
of
the
deck
and
was
drawn
into
the
wheelhouse
the
doors
of
which
were
closed
shutting
in
a
few
only
of
the
men
i
waited
quite
quiet
after
a
space
of
a
few
minutes
captain
rooke
in
his
uniform
walked
out
of
the
wheelhouse
he
entered
a
small
boat
which
had
been
in
the
meantime
lowered
for
the
purpose
and
was
rowed
to
the
steps
on
the
mole
ascending
these
he
came
directly
towards
the
signaltower
when
he
had
ascended
and
stood
beside
me
he
saluted
well
i
asked
all
well
sir
he
answered
we
shant
have
any
more
trouble
with
that
lot
i
think
you
warned
that
piratei
wish
he
had
been
in
truth
a
clean
honest
straightforward
pirate
instead
of
the
measly
turkish
swab
he
wasthat
something
might
occur
before
the
first
stroke
of
six
bells
well
something
has
occurred
and
for
him
and
all
his
crew
that
six
bells
will
never
sound
so
the
lord
fights
for
the
cross
against
the
crescent
bismillah
amen
he
said
this
in
a
manifestly
formal
way
as
though
declaiming
a
ritual
the
next
instant
he
went
on
in
the
thoroughly
practical
conventional
way
which
was
usual
to
him
may
i
ask
a
favour
mr
sent
leger
a
thousand
my
dear
rooke
i
said
you
cant
ask
me
anything
which
i
shall
not
freely
grant
and
i
speak
within
my
brief
from
the
national
council
you
have
saved
ilsin
this
day
and
the
council
will
thank
you
for
it
in
due
time
me
sir
he
said
with
a
look
of
surprise
on
his
face
which
seemed
quite
genuine
if
you
think
that
i
am
well
out
of
it
i
was
afraid
when
i
woke
that
you
might
courtmartial
me
courtmartial
you
what
for
i
asked
surprised
in
my
turn
for
going
to
sleep
on
duty
sir
and
the
fact
is
i
was
worn
out
in
the
attack
on
the
silent
tower
last
night
and
when
you
had
your
interview
with
the
pirateall
good
pirates
forgive
me
for
the
blasphemy
amenand
i
knew
that
everything
was
going
smoothly
i
went
into
the
wheelhouse
and
took
forty
winks
he
said
all
this
without
moving
so
much
as
an
eyelid
from
which
i
gathered
that
he
wished
absolute
silence
to
be
observed
on
my
part
whilst
i
was
revolving
this
in
my
mind
he
went
on
touching
that
request
sir
when
i
have
left
you
and
the
voivodeand
the
voivodin
of
courseat
vissarion
together
with
such
others
as
you
may
choose
to
bring
there
with
you
may
i
bring
the
yacht
back
here
for
a
spell
i
rather
think
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
cleaning
up
to
be
done
and
the
crew
of
the
lady
with
myself
are
the
men
to
do
it
we
shall
be
back
by
nightfall
at
the
creek
do
as
you
think
best
admiral
rooke
i
said
admiral
yes
admiral
at
present
i
can
only
say
that
tentatively
but
by
tomorrow
i
am
sure
the
national
council
will
have
confirmed
it
i
am
afraid
old
friend
that
your
squadron
will
be
only
your
flagship
for
the
present
but
later
we
may
do
better
so
long
as
i
am
admiral
your
honour
i
shall
have
no
other
flagship
than
the
lady
i
am
not
a
young
man
but
young
or
old
my
pennon
shall
float
over
no
other
deck
now
one
other
favour
mr
sent
leger
it
is
a
corollary
of
the
first
so
i
do
not
hesitate
to
ask
may
i
appoint
lieutenant
desmond
my
present
first
officer
to
the
command
of
the
battleship
of
course
he
will
at
first
only
command
the
prize
crew
but
in
such
case
he
will
fairly
expect
the
confirmation
of
his
rank
later
i
had
better
perhaps
tell
you
sir
that
he
is
a
very
capable
seaman
learned
in
all
the
sciences
that
pertain
to
a
battleship
and
bred
in
the
first
navy
in
the
world
by
all
means
admiral
your
nomination
shall
i
think
i
may
promise
you
be
confirmed
not
another
word
we
spoke
i
returned
with
him
in
his
boat
to
the
lady
which
was
brought
to
the
dock
wall
where
we
were
received
with
tumultuous
cheering
i
hurried
off
to
my
wife
and
the
voivode
rooke
calling
desmond
to
him
went
on
the
bridge
of
the
lady
which
turned
and
went
out
at
terrific
speed
to
the
battleship
which
was
already
drifting
up
northward
on
the
tide
from
the
report
of
cristoferos
scribe
of
the
national
council
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
july
8
1907
the
meeting
of
the
national
council
july
6
was
but
a
continuation
of
that
held
before
the
rescue
of
the
voivodin
vissarion
the
members
of
the
council
having
been
during
the
intervening
night
housed
in
the
castle
of
vissarion
when
in
the
early
morning
they
met
all
were
jubilant
for
late
at
night
the
firesignal
had
flamed
up
from
ilsin
with
the
glad
news
that
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
was
safe
having
been
rescued
with
great
daring
on
an
aeroplane
by
his
daughter
and
the
gospodar
rupert
as
the
people
call
himmister
rupert
sent
leger
as
he
is
in
his
british
name
and
degree
whilst
the
council
was
sitting
word
came
that
a
great
peril
to
the
town
of
ilsin
had
been
averted
a
warvessel
acknowledging
to
no
nationality
and
therefore
to
be
deemed
a
pirate
had
threatened
to
bombard
the
town
but
just
before
the
time
fixed
for
the
fulfilment
of
her
threat
she
was
shaken
to
such
an
extent
by
some
subaqueous
means
that
though
she
herself
was
seemingly
uninjured
nothing
was
left
alive
on
board
thus
the
lord
preserves
his
own
the
consideration
of
this
as
well
as
the
other
incident
was
postponed
until
the
coming
voivode
and
the
gospodar
rupert
together
with
who
were
already
on
their
way
hither
the
same
later
in
the
same
day
the
council
resumed
its
sitting
at
four
oclock
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
and
the
voivodin
teuta
had
arrived
with
the
gospodar
rupert
as
the
mountaineers
call
him
mr
rupert
sent
leger
on
the
armoured
yacht
he
calls
the
lady
the
national
council
showed
great
pleasure
when
the
voivode
entered
the
hall
in
which
the
council
met
he
seemed
much
gratified
by
the
reception
given
to
him
mr
rupert
sent
leger
by
the
express
desire
of
the
council
was
asked
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
he
took
a
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
hall
and
seemed
to
prefer
to
remain
there
though
asked
by
the
president
of
the
council
to
sit
at
the
top
of
the
table
with
himself
and
the
voivode
when
the
formalities
of
such
councils
had
been
completed
the
voivode
handed
to
the
president
a
memorandum
of
his
report
on
his
secret
mission
to
foreign
courts
on
behalf
of
the
national
council
he
then
explained
at
length
for
the
benefit
of
the
various
members
of
the
council
the
broad
results
of
his
mission
the
result
was
he
said
absolutely
satisfactory
everywhere
he
had
been
received
with
distinguished
courtesy
and
given
a
sympathetic
hearing
several
of
the
powers
consulted
had
made
delay
in
giving
final
answers
but
this
he
explained
was
necessarily
due
to
new
considerations
arising
from
the
international
complications
which
were
universally
dealt
with
throughout
the
world
as
the
balkan
crisis
in
time
however
the
voivode
went
on
these
matters
became
so
far
declared
as
to
allow
the
waiting
powers
to
form
definite
judgmentwhich
of
course
they
did
not
declare
to
himas
to
their
own
ultimate
action
the
final
resultif
at
this
initial
stage
such
tentative
setting
forth
of
their
own
attitude
in
each
case
can
be
so
namedwas
that
he
returned
full
of
hope
founded
he
might
say
upon
a
justifiable
personal
belief
that
the
great
powers
throughout
the
worldnorth
south
east
and
westwere
in
thorough
sympathy
with
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
in
its
aspirations
for
the
continuance
of
its
freedom
i
also
am
honoured
he
continued
to
bring
to
you
the
great
council
of
the
nation
the
assurance
of
protection
against
unworthy
aggression
on
the
part
of
neighbouring
nations
of
present
greater
strength
whilst
he
was
speaking
the
gospodar
rupert
was
writing
a
few
words
on
a
strip
of
paper
which
he
sent
up
to
the
president
when
the
voivode
had
finished
speaking
there
was
a
prolonged
silence
the
president
rose
and
in
a
hush
said
that
the
council
would
like
to
hear
mr
rupert
sent
leger
who
had
a
communication
to
make
regarding
certain
recent
events
mr
rupert
sent
leger
rose
and
reported
how
since
he
had
been
entrusted
by
the
council
with
the
rescue
of
the
voivode
peter
of
vissarion
he
had
by
aid
of
the
voivodin
effected
the
escape
of
the
voivode
from
the
silent
tower
also
that
following
this
happy
event
the
mountaineers
who
had
made
a
great
cordon
round
the
tower
so
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
voivode
had
been
imprisoned
within
it
had
stormed
it
in
the
night
as
a
determined
resistance
was
offered
by
the
marauders
who
had
used
it
as
a
place
of
refuge
none
of
these
escaped
he
then
went

the

without

in

some
undersea

which

a
destructive
effect
on

then
he
added
certain
words
which
i
give
verbatim

show
my

tell
you
at
this
the

opportunity
i
have
had
of
certain
matters
personal
primarily

in

come
to

on
the
affairs
of

i
shall
not
feel
that
i
have
done
a
duty
long
due
to
you
or
your
predecessors
in
office
and
which
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
that
i
have
only
kept
back
for
purposes
of
statecraft
may
i
ask
that
you
will
come
back
with
me
in
memory
to
the
year
1890
when
our
struggle
against
ottoman
aggression
later
on
so
successfully
brought
to
a
close
was
begun
we
were
then
in
a
desperate
condition
our
finances
had
run
so
low
that
we
could
not
purchase
even
the
bread
which
we
required
nay
more
we
could
not
procure
through
the
national
exchequer
what
we
wanted
more
than
breadarms
of
modern
effectiveness
for
men
may
endure
hunger
and
yet
fight
well
as
the
glorious
past
of
our
country
has
proved
again
and
again
and
again
but
when
our
foes
are
better
armed
than
we
are
the
penalty
is
dreadful
to
a
nation
small
as
our
own
is
in
number
no
matter
how
brave
their
hearts
in
this
strait
i
myself
had
to
secretly
raise
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
to
procure
the
weapons
we
needed
to
this
end
i
sought
the
assistance
of
a
great
merchantprince
to
whom
our
nation
as
well
as
myself
was
known
he
met
me
in
the
same
generous
spirit
which
he
had
shown
to
other
struggling
nationalities
throughout
a
long
and
honourable
career
when
i
pledged
to
him
as
security
my
own
estates
he
wished
to
tear
up
the
bond
and
only
under
pressure
would
he
meet
my
wishes
in
this
respect
lords
of
the
council
it
was
his
money
thus
generously
advanced
which
procured
for
us
the
arms
with
which
we
hewed
out
our
freedom
not
long
ago
that
noble
merchantand
here
i
trust
you
will
pardon
me
that
i
am
so
moved
as
to
perhaps
appear
to
suffer

few
hours
ago

benefactor
of

in

secret

the
whole
of
those
estates
which
long
ago
i
had
forfeited
by
effluxion
of
time
inasmuch
as
i
had
been
unable
to
fulfil
the
terms
of
my
voluntary
bond
it
grieves
me
to
think
that
i
have
had
to
keep
you
so
long
in
ignorance
of
the
good
thought

wishes

acts
of
this
great

it
was
by
his
wise
counsel
fortified
by
my
own
judgment
that
i
was
silent
for
indeed
i
feared
as
he
did
lest
in
our
troublous
times
some
doubting
spirit
without
our
boundaries
or
even
within
it
might
mistrust
the
honesty
of
my
purposes
for
public
good

i
was
no

as

wished
to
obtain
your

till
my

he
held
her
safety
in
trust
this
was
so
not
from
any
merit
of
mine
but
because
she
in
her
own
person
had
undertaken
for
the
service
of
our
nation
a
task
of
almost
incredible
difficulty
my
lords
were
she
child
of
another

i
should
extol
to
the
skies
her
bravery
her
selfdevotion
her
loyalty
to
the
land
she
loves
why
then
should
i
hesitate
to
speak
of
her
deeds
in
fitting
terms
since
it
is
my
duty
my
glory
to
hold
them
in
higher
honour
than
can
any
in
this
land
i
shall
not
shame
heror
even
myselfby
being
silent
when
such
a
duty
urges
me
to
speak
as
voivode
as
trusted
envoy
of
our

as
father
ages
hence
loyal
men
and
women
of
our

of

sing
her
deeds
in

sacred

during
that
march
that
we

the
future
this
brave
woman
has
won
knightly
spurs
as
well
as
any
paladin
of

so
is
it
meet
that
ere
she
might
mate
with
one
worthy
of
her
you
who
hold
in
your
hands
the
safety
and
honour
of
the

give
your
approval
to
you
was
it
given
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
worth
of
this
gallant
englisher
now
my
son
you
judged
him
then
before
you
had
seen
his
valour
his
strength
and
skill
exercised
on
behalf
of
a
national
cause
you
judged
wisely
oh
my
brothers
and
out
of
a
grateful
heart
i
thank
you
one
and
all
for
it
well
has

justified
your
trust
by
his
later
acts
when
in
obedience
to
the
summons
of

vladika
he
put
the
nation
in
a
blaze
and
ranged
our
boundaries
with
a
ring
of
steel
he
did
so
unknowing
that
what
was
dearest
to
him
in
the
world
was
at
stake
he
saved
my
daughters
honour
and
happiness
and
won
her
safety
by
an
act
of
valour
that
outvies
any
told
in
history
he
took
my

with
him
to
bring
me
out
from
the
silent
tower
on
the
wings

fain
have

1907
for
nearly
a
week
we
waited
for
some
message
from
constantinople
fully
expecting
either
a
declaration
of
war
or
else
some
inquiry
so
couched
as
to
make
war
an
inevitable
result
the
national
council
remained
on
at
vissarion
as
the
guests
of
the
voivode
to
whom
in
accordance
with
my
uncles
will
i
had
prepared
to
retransfer
all
his
estates
he
was
by
the
way
unwilling
at
first
to
accept
and
it
was
only
when
i
showed
him
uncle
rogers
letter
and
made
him
read
the
deed
of
transfer
prepared
in
anticipation
by
mr
trent
that
he
allowed
me
to
persuade
him
finally
he
said
as
you
my
good
friends
have
so
arranged
i
must
accept
be
it
only
in
honour
to
the
wishes
of
the
dead
but
remember
i
only
do
so
but
for
the
present
reserving
to
myself
the
freedom
to
withdraw
later
if
i
so
desire
but
constantinople
was
silent
the
whole
nefarious
scheme
was
one
of
the
putup
jobs
which
are
part
of
the
dirty
work
of
a
certain
order
of
statecraftto
be
accepted
if
successful
to
be
denied
in
case
of
failure
the
matter
stood
thus
turkey
had
thrown
the
diceand
lost
her
men
were
dead
her
ship
was
forfeit
it
was
only
some
ten
days
after
the

was
left
derelict
with
every
living
thingthat
is
everything
that
had
been

its

broken
as
rooke
informed
me
when
he
brought
the
ship
down
the
creek
and
housed
it
in
the
dock

has
been

at

of
the
total

and

foundered
in
a
storm
on
the
night
of
july
5
some
distance
off
cabrera
in
the
balearic
isles
there
were
no
survivors
and
no
wreckage
was
discovered
by
the
ships
which
went
in

and
the
mustaphaor
reported
from
anywhere
along
the
shores
of
the
islands
of
which
exhaustive
search
was
made
the
mahmoud
was
doublemanned
as
she
carried
a
full
extra
crew
sent
on
an
educational
cruise
on
the
most
perfectly
scientifically
equipped
warship
on
service
in
the
mediterranean
waters
when
the
voivode
and
i
talked
over
the
matter
he
said
after
all
turkey
is
a
shrewd
power
she
certainly
seems
to
know
when
she
is
beaten
and
does
not
intend
to
make
a
bad
thing
seem
worse
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
well
tis
a
bad
wind
that
blows
good
to
nobody
as
the
mahmoud
was
lost
off
the
balearics
it
cannot
have
been
her
that
put
the
marauders
on
shore
and
trained
her
big
guns
on
ilsin
we
take
it
therefore
that
the
latter
must
have
been
a
pirate
and
as
we
have
taken
her
derelict
in
our
waters
she
is
now
ours
in
all
ways
anyhow
she
is
ours
and
is
the
first
ship
of
her
class
in
the
navy
of
the
blue
mountains
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
even
if
she
wasor
is
stilla
turkish
ship
admiral
rooke
would
not
be
inclined
to
let
her
go
as
for
captain
desmond
i
think
he
would
go
straight
out
of
his
mind
if
such
a
thing
was
to
be
even
suggested
to
him
it
will
be
a
pity
if
we
have
any
more
trouble
for
life
here
is
very
happy
with
us
all
now
the
voivode
is
i
think
like
a
man
in
a
dream
teuta
is
ideally
happy
and
the
real
affection
which
sprang
up
between
them
when
she
and
aunt
janet
met
is
a
joy
to
think
of
i
had
posted
teuta
about
her
so
that
when
they
should
meet
my
wife
might
not
by
any
inadvertence
receive
or
cause
any
pain
but
the
moment
teuta
saw
her
she
ran
straight
over
to
her
and
lifted
her
in
her
strong
young
arms
and
raising
her
up
as
one
would
lift
a
child
kissed
her
then
when
she
had
put
her
sitting
in
the
chair
from
which
she
had
arisen
when
we
entered
the
room
she
knelt
down
before
her
and
put
her
face
down
in
her
lap
aunt
janets
face
was
a
study
i
myself
could
hardly
say
whether
at
the
first
moment
surprise
or
joy
predominated
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
instant
after
she
seemed
to
beam
with
happiness
when
teuta
knelt
to
her
she
could
only
say
my
dear
my
dear
i
am
glad
ruperts
wife
you
and
i
must
love
each
other
very
much
seeing
that
they
were
laughing
and
crying
in
each
others
arms
i
thought
it
best
to
come
away
and
leave
them
alone
and
i
didnt
feel
a
bit
lonely
either
when
i
was
out
of
sight
of
them
i
knew
that
where
those
two
dear
women
were
there
was
a
place
for
my
own
heart
when
i
came
back
teuta
was
sitting
on
aunt
janets
knee
it
seemed
rather
stupendous
for
the
old
lady
for
teuta
is
such
a
splendid
creature
that
even
when
she
sits
on
my
own
knee
and
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
us
in
some
mirror
i
cannot
but
notice
what
a
noblybuilt
girl
she
is
my
wife
was
jumping
up
as
soon
as
i
was
seen
but
aunt
janet
held
her
tight
to
her
and
said
dont
stir
dear
it
is
such
happiness
to
me
to
have
you
there
rupert
has
always
been
my
little
boy
and
in
spite
of
all
his
being
such
a
giant
he
is
so
still
and
so
you
that
he
loves
must
be
my
little
girlin
spite
of
all
your
beauty
and
your
strengthand
sit
on
my
knee
till
you
can
place
there
a
little
one
that
shall
be
dear
to
us
all
and
that
shall
let
me
feel
my
youth
again
when
first
i
saw
you
i
was
surprised
for
somehow
though
i
had
never
seen
you
nor
even
heard
of
you
i
seemed
to
know
your
face
sit
where
you
are
dear
it
is
only
rupertand
we
both
love
him
teuta
looked
at
me
flushing
rosily
but
she
sat
quiet
and
drew
the
old
ladys
white
head
on
her
young
breast

1907
i
used
to
think
that
whenever
rupert
should
get
married
or
start
on
the
way
to
it
by
getting
engagedi
would
meet
his
future
wife
with
something
of
the
same
affection
that
i
have
always
had
for
himself
but
i
know
now
that
what
was
really
in
my
mind
was
jealousy
and
that
i
was
really
fighting
against
my
own
instincts
and
pretending
to
myself
that
i
was
not
jealous
had
i
ever
had
the
faintest
idea
that
she
would
be
anything
the
least
like
teuta
that
sort
of
feeling
should
never
have
had
even
a
foothold
no
wonder
my
dear
boy
is
in
love
with
her
for
truth
to
tell
i
am
in
love
with
her
myself
i
dont
think
i
ever
met
a
creaturea
woman
creature
of
course
i
meanwith
so
many
splendid
qualities
i
almost
fear
to
say
it
lest
it
should
seem
to
myself
wrong
but
i
think
she
is
as
good
as
a
woman
as
rupert
is
as
a
man
and
what
more
than
that
can
i
say
i
thought
i
loved
her
and
trusted
her
and
knew
her
all
i
could
until
this
morning
i
was
in
my
own
room
as
it
is
still
called
for
though
rupert
tells
me
in
confidence
that
under
his
uncles
will
the
whole
estate
of
vissarion
castle
and
all
really
belongs
to
the
voivode
and
though
the
voivode
has
been
persuaded
to
accept
the
position
he
the
voivode
will
not
allow
anything
to
be
changed
he
will
not
even
hear
a
word
of
my
going
or
changing
my
room
or
anything
and
rupert
backs
him
up
in
it
and
teuta
too
so
what
am
i
to
do
but
let
the
dears
have
their
way
well
this
morning
when
rupert
was
with
the
voivode
at
a
meeting
of
the
national
council
in
the
great
hall
teuta
came
to
me
and
after
closing
the
door
and
bolting
it
which
surprised
me
a
little
came
and
knelt
down
beside
me
and
put
her
face
in
my
lap
i
stroked
her
beautiful
black
hair
and
said
what
is
it
teuta
darling
is
there
any
trouble
and
why
did
you
bolt
the
door
has
anything
happened
to
rupert
when
she
looked
up
i
saw
that
her
beautiful
black
eyes
with
the
stars
in
them
were
overflowing
with
tears
not
yet
shed
but
she
smiled
through
them
and
the
tears
did
not
fall
when
i
saw
her
smile
my
heart
was
eased
and
i
said
without
thinking
thank
god
darling
rupert
is
all
right
i
thank
god
too
dear
aunt
janet
she
said
softly
and
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
laid
her
head
on
my
breast
go
on
dear
i
said
tell
me
what
it
is
that
troubles
you
this
time
i
saw
the
tears
drop
as
she
lowered
her
head
and
hid
her
face
from
me
im
afraid
i
have
deceived
you
aunt
janet
and
that
you
will
notcannotforgive
me
lord
save
you
child
i
said
theres
nothing
that
you
could
do
that
i
could
not
and
would
not
forgive
not
that
you
would
ever
do
anything
base
for
that
is
the
only
thing
that
is
hard
to
forgive
tell
me
now
what
troubles
you
she
looked
up
in
my
eyes
fearlessly
this
time
with
only
the
signs
of
tears
that
had
been
and
said
proudly
nothing
base
aunt
janet
my
fathers
daughter
would
not
willingly
be
base
i
do
not
think
she
could
moreover
had
i
ever
done
anything
base
i
should
not
be
here
forfori
should
never
have
been
ruperts
wife
then
what
is
it
tell
your
old
aunt
janet
dearie
she
answered
me
with
another
question
aunt
janet
do
you
know
who
i
am
and
how
i
first
met
rupert
you
are
the
voivodin
teuta
vissarionthe
daughter
of
the
voivodeor
rather
you
were
you
are
now
mrs
rupert
sent
leger
for
he
is
still
an
englishman
and
a
good
subject
of
our
noble
king
yes
aunt
janet
she
said
i
am
that
and
proud
to
be
itprouder
than
i
would
be
were
i
my
namesake
who
was
queen
in
the
old
days
but
how
and
where
did
i
see
rupert
first
i
did
not
know
and
frankly
told
her
so
so
she
answered
her
question
herself
i
saw
him
first
in
his
own
room
at
night
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
in
whatever
she
did
had
been
nothing
wrong
so
i
sat
silent
waiting
for
her
to
go
on
i
was
in
danger
and
in
deadly
fear
i
was
afraid
i
might
dienot
that
i
fear
deathand
i
wanted
help
and
warmth
i
was
not
dressed
as
i
am
now
on
the
instant
it
came
to
me
how
i
knew
her
face
even
the
first
time
i
had
seen
it
i
wished
to
help
her
out
of
the
embarrassing
part
of
her
confidence
so
i
said
dearie
i
think
i
know
tell
me
child
will
you
put
on
the
frock



the
dress



costume
you
wore
that
night
and
let
me
see
you
in
it
it
is
not
mere
idle
curiosity
my
child
but
something
far
far
above
such
idle
folly
wait
for
me
a
minute
aunt
janet
she
said
as
she
rose
up
i
shall
not
be
long
then
she
left
the
room
in
a
very
few
minutes
she
was
back
her
appearance
might
have
frightened
some
people
for
she
was
clad
only
in
a
shroud
her
feet
were
bare
and
she
walked
across
the
room
with
the
gait
of
an
empress
and
stood
before
me
with
her
eyes
modestly
cast
down
but
when
presently
she
looked
up
and
caught
my
eyes
a
smile
rippled
over
her
face
she
threw
herself
once
more
before
me
on
her
knees
and
embraced
me
as
she
said
i
was
afraid
i
might
frighten
you
dear
i
knew
i
could
truthfully
reassure
her
as
to
that
so
i
proceeded
to
do
so
do
not
worry
yourself
my
dear
i
am
not
by
nature
timid
i
come
of
a
fighting
stock
which
has
sent
out
heroes
and
i
belong
to
a
family
wherein
is
the
gift
of
second
sight
why
should
we
fear
we
know
moreover
i
saw
you
in
that
dress
before
teuta
i
saw
you
and
rupert
married
this
time
she
herself
it
was
that
seemed
disconcerted
saw
us
married
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
to
be
there
i
was
not
there
my
seeing
was
long
before
tell
me
dear
what
day
or
rather
what
night
was
it
that
you
first
saw
rupert
she
answered
sadly
i
do
not
know
alas
i
lost
count
of
the
days
as
i
lay
in
the
tomb
in
that
dreary
crypt
was
youryour
clothing
wet
that
night
i
asked
yes
i
had
to
leave
the
crypt
for
a
great
flood
was
out
and
the
church
was
flooded
i
had
to
seek
helpwarmthfor
i
feared
i
might
die
oh
i
was
not
as
i
have
told
you
afraid
of
death
but
i
had
undertaken
a
terrible
task
to
which
i
had
pledged
myself
it
was
for
my
fathers
sake
and
the
sake
of
the
land
and
i
felt
that
it
was
a
part
of
my
duty
to
live
and
so
i
lived
on
when
death
would
have
been
relief
it
was
to
tell
you
all
about
this
that
i
came
to
your
room
today
but
how
did
you
see
meusmarried
ah
my
child
i
answered
that
was
before
the
marriage
took
place
the
morn
after
the
night
that
you
came
in
the
wet
when
having
been
troubled
in
uncanny
dreaming
i
came
to
see
if
rupert
was
aricht
i
lost
remembrance
o
my
dreaming
for
the
floor
was
all
wet
and
that
took
off
my
attention
but
later
the
morn
after
rupert
used
his
fire
in
his
room
for
the
first
time
i
told
him
what
i
had
dreamt
for
lassie
my
dear
i
saw
ye
as
bride
at
that
weddin
in
fine
lace
oer
yer
shrood
and
orangeflowers
and
ithers
in
yer
black
hair
an
i
saw
the
stars
in
yer
bonny
eenthe
een
i
love
but
oh
my
dear
when
i
saw
the
shrood
and
kent
what
it
might
mean
i
expeckit
to
see
the
worms
crawl
round
yer
feet
but
do
ye
ask
yer
man
to
tell
ye
what
i
tellt
him
that
morn
twill
interest
ye
to
know
how
the
hairt
o
men

learn
by
dreams
has
he
ever
tellt
ye
aught
o
this
no
dear
she
said
simply
i
think
that
perhaps
he
was
afraid
that
one
or
other
of
us
if
not
both
might
be
upset
by
it
if
he
did
you
see
he
did
not
tell
you
anything
at
all
of
our
meeting
though
i
am
sure
that
he
will
be
glad
when
he
knows
that
we
both
know
all
about
it
and
have
told
each
other
everything
that
was
very
sweet
of
her
and
very
thoughtful
in
all
ways
so
i
said
that
which
i
thought
would
please
her
bestthat
is
the
truth
ah
lassie
that
is
what
a
wife
should
bewhat
a
wife
should
do
rupert
is
blessed
and
happy
to
have
his
heart
in
your
keeping
i
knew
from
the
added
warmth
of
her
kiss
what
i
had
said

1907
my
dear
cousin
rupert
we
have
heard
such
glowing
accounts
of
vissarion
that
i
am
coming
out

you
are

now
a
landowner
you
will
understand
that
my
coming

shall
be
head

the
familythe

related

a
member

therefore

from

to
the
gospodar
rupert
august
1
1907
sir
in
obedience
to
your
explicit
direction
that
i
should
meet
mr
ernest
r
h
melton
at
fiume
and
report
to
you
exactly
what
occurred
without
keeping
anything
backas
you
will
remember
you
said
i
beg
to
report
i
brought
the
steamyacht
trent
to
fiume
arriving
there
on
the
morning
of
thursday
at
1130
pm
i
went
to
meet
the
train
from
st
peter
due
1140
it
was
something
late
arriving
just
as
the
clock
was
beginning
to
strike
midnight
mr
melton
was
on
board
and
with
him
his
valet
jenkinson
i
am
bound
to
say
that
he
did
not
seem
very
pleased
with
his
journey
and
expressed
much
disappointment
at
not
seeing
your
honour
awaiting
him
i
explained
as
you
directed
that
you
had
to
attend
with
the
voivode
vissarion
and
the
vladika
the
national
council
which
met
at
plazac
or
that
otherwise
you
would
have
done
yourself
the
pleasure
of
coming
to
meet
him
i
had
of
course
reserved
rooms
the
prince
of
waless
suite
for
him
at
the
re
dungheria
and
had
waiting
the
carriage
which
the
proprietor
had
provided
for
the
prince
of
wales
when
he
stayed
there
mr
melton
took
his
valet
with
him
on
the
boxseat
and
i
followed
in
a
stadtwagen
with
the
luggage
when
i
arrived
i
found
the
maitre
dhotel
in
a
stupor
of
concern
the
english
nobleman
he
said
had
found
fault
with
everything
and
used
to
him
language
to
which
he
was
not
accustomed
i
quieted
him
telling
him
that
the
stranger
was
probably
unused
to
foreign
ways
and
assuring
him
that
your
honour
had
every
faith
in
him
he
announced
himself
satisfied
and
happy
at
the
assurance
but
i
noticed
that
he
promptly
put
everything
in
the
hands
of
the
headwaiter
telling
him
to
satisfy
the
milor
at
any
cost
and
then
went
away
to
some
urgent
business
in
vienna
clever
man
i
took
mr
meltons
orders
for
our
journey
in
the
morning
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
for
which
he
wished
he
simply
said
to
me
everything
is
rotten
go
to
hell
and
shut
the
door
after
you
his
man
who
seems
a
very
decent
little
fellow
though
he
is
as
vain
as
a
peacock
and
speaks
with
a
cockney
accent
which
is
simply
terrible
came
down
the
passage
after
me
and
explained
on
his
own
as
he
expressed
it
that
his
master
mr
ernest
was
upset
by
the
long
journey
and
that
i
was
not
to
mind
i
did
not
wish
to
make
him
uncomfortable
so
i
explained
that
i
minded
nothing
except
what
your
honour
wished
that
the
steamyacht
would
be
ready
at
7
am
and
that
i
should
be
waiting
in
the
hotel
from
that
time
on
till
mr
melton
cared
to
start
to
bring
him
aboard
in
the
morning
i
waited
till
the
man
jenkinson
came
and
told
me
that
mr
ernest
would
start
at
ten
i
asked
if
he
would
breakfast
on
board
he
answered
that
he
would
take
his
cafecomplet
at
the
hotel
but
breakfast
on
board
we
left
at
ten
and
took
the
electric
pinnace
out
to
the
trent
which
lay
with
steam
up
in
the
roads
breakfast
was
served
on
board
by
his
orders
and
presently
he
came
up
on
the
bridge
where
i
was
in
command
he
brought
his
man
jenkinson
with
him
seeing
me
there
and
not
i
suppose
understanding
that
i
was
in
command
he
unceremoniously
ordered
me
to
go
on
the
deck
indeed
he
named
a
place
much
lower
i
made
a
sign
of
silence
to
the
quartermaster
at
the
wheel
who
had
released
the
spokes
and
was
going
i
feared
to
make
some
impertinent
remark
jenkinson
joined
me
presently
and
said
as
some
sort
of
explanation
of
his
masters
discourtesy
of
which
he
was
manifestly
ashamed
if
not
as
an
amende
the
governor
is
in
a
hell
of
a
wax
this
morning
when
we
got
in
sight
of
meleda
mr
melton
sent
for
me
and
asked
me
where
we
were
to
land
i
told
him
that
unless
he
wished
to
the
contrary
we
were
to
run
to
vissarion
but
that
my
instructions
were
to
land
at
whatever
port
he
wished
whereupon
he
told
me
that
he
wished
to
stay
the
night
at
some
place
where
he
might
be
able
to
see
some
life
he
was
pleased
to
add
something
which
i
presume
he
thought
jocular
about
my
being
able
to
coach
him
in
such
matters
as
doubtless
even
an
old
hasbeen
like
you
had
still
some
sort
of
an
eye
for
a
pretty
girl
i
told
him
as
respectfully
as
i
could
that
i
had
no
knowledge
whatever
on
such
subjects
which
were
possibly
of
some
interest
to
younger
men
but
of
none
to
me
he
said
no
more
so
after
waiting
for
further
orders
but
without
receiving
any
i
said
i
suppose
sir
we
shall
run
to
vissarion
run
to
the
devil
if
you
like
was
his
reply
as
he
turned
away
when
we
arrived
in
the
creek
at
vissarion
he
seemed
much
milderless
aggressive
in
his
manner
but
when
he
heard
that
you
were
detained
at
plazac
he
got
rather
freshi
use
the
american
termagain
i
greatly
feared
there
would
be
a
serious
misfortune
before
we
got
into
the
castle
for
on
the
dock
was
julia
the
wife
of
michael
the
master
of
the
wine
who
is
as
you
know
very
beautiful
mr
melton
seemed
much
taken
with
her
and
she
being
flattered
by
the
attention
of
a
strange
gentleman
and
your
honours
kinsman
put
aside
the
standoffishness
of
most
of
the
blue
mountain
women
whereupon
mr
melton
forgetting
himself
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
instantly
there
was
a
hubbub
the
mountaineers
present
drew
their
handjars
and
almost
on
the
instant
sudden
death
appeared
to
be
amongst
us
happily
the
men
waited
as
michael
who
had
just
arrived
on
the
quaywall
as
the
outrage
took
place
ran
forward
wheeling
his
handjar
round
his
head
and
manifestly
intending
to
decapitate
mr
melton
on
the
instanti
am
sorry
to
say
it
for
it
created
a
terribly
bad
effectmr
melton
dropped
on
his
knees
in
a
state
of
panic
there
was
just
this
good
use
in
itthat
there
was
a
pause
of
a
few
seconds
during
that
time
the
little
cockney
valet
who
has
the
heart
of
a
man
in
him
literally
burst
his
way
forward
and
stood
in
front
of
his
master
in
boxing
attitude
calling
out
ere
come
on
the
ole
lot
of

he
honly
kissed
the

any
man

if

to
cut
off
somebodys
ed
cut

mine
i
aint
afride
there
was
such
genuine
pluck
in
this
and
it
formed
so
fine
a
contrast
to
the
others
craven
attitude
forgive
me
your
honour
but
you
want
the
truth
that
i
was
glad
he
was
an
englishman
too
the
mountaineers
recognized
his
spirit
and
saluted
with
their
handjars
even
michael
amongst
the
number
half
turning
his
head
the
little
man
said
in
a
fierce
whisper
buck
up
guvnor
get
up
or
theyll
slice
ye
eres
mr
rooke
ell
see
ye
through
it
by
this
time
the
men
were
amenable
to
reason
and
when
i
reminded
them
that
mr
melton
was
your
honours
cousin
they
put
aside
their
handjars
and
went
about
their
work
i
asked
mr
melton
to
follow
and
led
the
way
to
the
castle
when
we
got
close
to
the
great
entrance
within
the
walled
courtyard
we
found
a
large
number
of
the
servants
gathered
and
with
them
many
of
the
mountaineers
who
have
kept
an
organized
guard
all
round
the
castle
ever
since
the
abducting
of
the
voivodin
as
both
your
honour
and
the
voivode
were
away
at
plazac
the
guard
had
for
the
time
been
doubled
when
the
steward
came
and
stood
in
the
doorway
the
servants
stood
off
somewhat
and
the
mountaineers
drew
back
to
the
farther
sides
and
angles
of
the
courtyard
the
voivodin
had
of
course
been
informed
of
the
guests
your
cousin
coming
and
came
to
meet
him
in
the
old
custom
of
the
blue
mountains
as
your
honour
only
came
to
the
blue
mountains
recently
and
as
no
occasion
has
been
since
then
of
illustrating
the
custom
since
the
voivode
was
away
and
the
voivodin
then
believed
to
be
dead
perhaps
i
who
have
lived
here
so
long
may
explain
when
to
an
old
blue
mountain
house
a
guest
comes
whom
it
is
wished
to
do
honour
the
lady
as
in
the
vernacular
the
mistress
of
the
house
is
called
comes
herself
to
meet
the
guest
at
the
dooror
rather
outside
the
doorso
that
she
can
herself
conduct
him
within
it
is
a
pretty
ceremony
and
it
is
said
that
of
old
in
kingly
days
the
monarch
always
set
much
store
by
it
the
custom
is
that
when
she
approaches
the
honoured
guest
he
need
not
be
royal
she
bendsor
more
properly
kneelsbefore
him
and
kisses
his
hand
it
has
been
explained
by
historians
that
the
symbolism
is
that
the
woman
showing
obedience
to
her
husband
as
the
married
woman
of
the
blue
mountains
always
does
emphasizes
that
obedience
to
her
husbands
guest
the
custom
is
always
observed
in
its
largest
formality
when
a
young
wife
receives
for
the
first
time
a
guest
and
especially
one
whom
her
husband
wishes
to
honour
the
voivodin
was
of
course
aware
that
mr
melton
was
your
kinsman
and
naturally
wished
to
make
the
ceremony
of
honour
as
marked
as
possible
so
as
to
show
overtly
her
sense
of
her
husbands
worth
when
we
came
into
the
courtyard
i
held
back
of
course
for
the
honour
is
entirely
individual
and
is
never
extended
to
any
other
no
matter
how
worthy
he
may
be
naturally
mr
melton
did
not
know
the
etiquette
of
the
situation
and
so
for
that
is
not
to
be
blamed
he
took
his
valet
with
him
when
seeing
someone
coming
to
the
door
he
went
forward
i
thought
he
was
going
to
rush
to
his
welcomer
such
though
not
in
the
ritual
would
have
been
natural
in
a
young
kinsman
wishing
to
do
honour
to
the
bride
of
his
host
and
would
to
anyone
have
been
both
understandable
and
forgivable
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
time
but
i
have
since
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
not
then
heard
of
your
honours
marriage
which
i
trust
you
will
in
justice
to
the
young
gentleman
bear
in
mind
when
considering
the
matter
unhappily
however
he
did
not
show
any
such
eagerness
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
to
make
a
point
of
showing
indifference
it
seemed
to
me
myself
that
he
seeing
somebody
wishing
to
make
much
of
him
took
what
he
considered
a
safe
opportunity
of
restoring
to
himself
his
own
good
opinion
which
must
have
been
considerably
lowered
in
the
episode
of
the
wine
masters
wife
the
voivodin
thinking
doubtless
your
honour
to
add
a
fresh
lustre
to
her
welcome
had
donned
the
costume
which
all
her
nation
has
now
come
to
love
and
to
accept
as
a
dress
of
ceremonial
honour
she
wore
her
shroud
it
moved
the
hearts
of
all
of
us
who
looked
on
to
see
it
and
we
appreciated
its
being
worn
for
such
a
cause
but
mr
melton
did
not
seem
to
care
as
he
had
been
approaching
she
had
begun
to
kneel
and
was
already
on
her
knees
whilst
he
was
several
yards
away
there
he
stopped
and
turned
to
speak
to
his
valet
put
a
glass
in
his
eye
and
looked
all
round
him
and
up
and
downindeed
everywhere
except
at
the
great
lady
who
was
on
her
knees
before
him
waiting
to
bid
him
welcome
i
could
see
in
the
eyes
of
such
of
the
mountaineers
as
were
within
my
range
of
vision
a
growing
animosity
so
hoping
to
keep
down
any
such
expression
which
i
knew
would
cause
harm
to
your
honour
and
the
voivodin
i
looked
all
round
them
straight
in
their
faces
with
a
fixed
frown
which
indeed
they
seemed
to
understand
for
they
regained
and
for
the
time
maintained
their
usual
dignified
calm
the
voivodin
may
i
say
bore
the
trial
wonderfully
no
human
being
could
see
that
she
was
in
any
degree
pained
or
even
surprised
mr
melton
stood
looking
round
him
so
long
that
i
had
full
time
to
regain
my
own
attitude
of
calm
at
last
he
seemed
to
come
back
to
the
knowledge
that
someone
was
waiting
for
him
and
sauntered
leisurely
forward
there
was
so
much
insolencemind
you
not
insolence
that
was
intended
to
appear
as
suchin
his
movement
that
the
mountaineers
began
to
steal
forward
when
he
was
close
up
to
the
voivodin
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
take
his
he
put
forward
one
finger
i
could
hear
the
intake
of
the
breath
of
the
men
now
close
around
for
i
had
moved
forward
too
i
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
be
close
to
your
guest
lest
something
should
happen
to
him
the
voivodin
still
kept
her
splendid
selfcontrol
raising
the
finger
put
forward
by
the
guest
with
the
same
deference
as
though
it
had
been
the
hand
of
a
king
she
bent
her
head
down
and
kissed
it
her
duty
of
courtesy
now
done
she
was
preparing
to
rise
when
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
pulling
out
a
sovereign
offered
it
to
her
his
valet
moved
his
hand
forward
as
if
to
pull
back
his
arm
but
it
was
too
late
i
am
sure
your
honour
that
no
affront
was
intended
he
doubtless
thought
that
he
was
doing
a
kindness
of
the
sort
usual
in
england
when
one
tips
a
housekeeper
but
all
the
same
to
one
in
her
position
it
was
an
affront
an
insult
open
and
unmistakable
so
it
was
received
by
the
mountaineers
whose
handjars
flashed
out
as
one
for
a
second
it
was
so
received
even
by
the
voivodin
who
with
face
flushing
scarlet
and
the
stars
in
her
eves
flaming
red
sprang
to
her
feet
but
in
that
second
she
had
regained
herself
and
to
all
appearances
her
righteous
anger
passed
away
stooping
she
took
the
hand
of
her
guest
and
raised
ityou
know
how
strong
she
isand
holding
it
in
hers
led
him
into
the
doorway
saying
you
are
welcome
kinsman
of
my
husband
to
the
house
of
my
father
which
is
presently
my
husbands
also
both
are
grieved
that
duty
having
called
them
away
for
the
time
they
are
unable
to
be
here
to
help
me
to
greet
you
i
tell
you
your
honour
that
it
was
a
lesson
in
selfrespect
which
anyone
who
saw
it
can
never
forget
as
to
me
it
makes
my
flesh
quiver
old
as
i
am
with
delight
and
my
heart
leap
may
i
as
a
faithful
servant
who
has
had
many
years
of
experience
suggest
that
your
honour
should
seemfor
the
present
at
any
ratenot
to
know
any
of
these
things
which
i
have
reported
as
you
wished
me
to
do
be
sure
that
the
voivodin
will
tell
you
her
gracious
self
aught
that
she
would
wish
you
to
know
and
such
reticence
on
your
part
must
make
for
her
happiness
even
if
it
did
not
for
your
own
so
that
you
may
know
all
as
you
desired
and
that
you
may
have
time
to
school
yourself
to
whatever
attitude
you
think
best
to
adopt

this
off

you

august
9
1907
to
me
it
seems
very
providential
that
rupert
was
not
at
home
when
that
dreadful
young
man
ernest
melton
arrived
though
it
is
possible
that
if
rupert
had
been
present
he
would
not
have
dared
to
conduct
himself
so
badly
of
course
i
heard
all
about
it
from
the
maids
teuta
never
opened
her
lips
to
me
on
the
subject
it
was
bad
enough
and
stupid
enough
for
him
to
try
to
kiss
a
decent
young
woman
like
julia
who
is
really
as
good
as
gold
and
as
modest
as
one
of
our
own
highland
lassies
but
to
think
of
him
insulting
teuta
the
little
beast
one
would
think
that
a
champion
idiot
out
of
an
equatorial
asylum
would
know
better
if
michael
the
wine
master
wanted
to
kill
him
i
wonder
what
my
rupert
and
hers
would
have
done
i
am
truly
thankful
that
he
was
not
present
and
i
am
thankful
too
that
i
was
not
present
either
for
i
should
have
made
an
exhibition
of
myself
and
rupert
would
not
have
liked
that
hethe
little
beast
might
have
seen
from
the
very
dress
that
the
dear
girl
wore
that
there
was
something
exceptional
about
her
but
on
one
account
i
should
have
liked
to
see
her
they
tell
me
that
she
was
in
her
true
dignity
like
a
queen
and
that
her
humility
in
receiving
her
husbands
kinsman
was
a
lesson
to
every
woman
in
the
land
i
must
be
careful
not
to
let
rupert
know
that
i
have
heard
of
the
incident
later
on
when
it
is
all
blown
over
and
the
young
man
has
been
got
safely
away
i
shall
tell
him
of
it
mr
rookelord
high
admiral
rooke
i
should
saymust
be
a
really
wonderful
man
to
have
so
held
himself
in
check
for
from
what
i
have
heard
of
him
he
must
in
his
younger
days
have
been
worse
than
old
morgan
of
panama
mr
ernest
roger
halbard
melton
of
humcroft
salop
little
knows
how
near
he
was
to
being
cleft
to
the
chine
also
fortunately
i
had
heard
of
his
meeting
with
teuta
before
he
came
to
see
me
for
i
did
not
get
back
from
my
walk
till
after
he
had
arrived
teutas
noble
example
was
before
me
and
i
determined
that
i
too
would
show
good
manners
under
any
circumstances
but
i
didnt
know
how
mean
he
is
think
of
his
saying
to
me
that
ruperts
position
here
must
be
a
great
source
of
pride
to
me
who
had
been
his
nursery
governess
he
said
nursemaid
first
but
then
stumbled
in
his
words
seeming
to
remember
something
i
did
not
turn
a
hair
i
am
glad
to
say
it
is
a
mercy
uncle
colin
was
not
here
for
i
honestly
believe
that
if
he
had
been
he
would
have
done
the
cleaving
to
the
chine
himself
it
has
been
a
narrow
escape
for
master
ernest
for
only
this
morning
rupert
had
a
message
sent
on
from
gibraltar
saying
that
he
was
arriving
with
his
clansmen
and
that
they
would
not
be
far
behind
his
letter
he
would
call
at
otranto
in
case
someone
should
come
across
to
pilot
him
to
vissarion
uncle
told
me
all
about
that
young
cad
having
offered
him
one
finger
in
mr
trents
office
though
of
course
he
didnt
let
the
cad
see
that
he
noticed
it
i
have
no
doubt
that
when
he
does
arrive
that
young
man
if
he
is
here
still
will
find
that
he
will
have
to
behave
himself
if
it
be
only
on
sir
colins
account
alone
the
same
later
i
had
hardly
finished
writing
when
the
lookout
on
the
tower
announced
that
the
teuta
as
rupert
calls
his
aeroplane
was
sighted
crossing
the
mountains
from
plazac
i
hurried
up
to
see
him
arrive
for
i
had
not
as
yet
seen
him
on
his
aero
mr
ernest
melton
came
up
too
teuta
was
of
course
before
any
of
us
she
seems
to
know
by
instinct
when
rupert
is
coming
it
was
certainly
a
wonderful
sight
to
see
the
little
aeroplane
with
outspread
wings
like
a
bird
in
flight
come
sailing
high
over
the
mountains
there
was
a
headwind
and
they
were
beating
against
it
otherwise
we
should
not
have
had
time
to
get
to
the
tower
before
the
arrival
when
once
the
aero
had
begun
to
drop
on
the
near
side
of
the
mountains
however
and
had
got
a
measure
of
shelter
from
them
her
pace
was
extraordinary
we
could
not
tell
of
course
what
sort
of
pace
she
came
at
from
looking
at
herself
but
we
gathered
some
idea
from
the
rate
at
which
the
mountains
and
hills
seemed
to
slide
away
from
under
her
when
she
got
over
the
foothills
which
are
about
ten
miles
away
she
came
on
at
a
swift
glide
that
seemed
to
throw
the
distance
behind
her
when
quite
close
she
rose
up
a
little
till
she
was
something
higher
than
the
tower
to
which
she
came
as
straight
as
an
arrow
from
the
bow
and
glided
to
her
moorings
stopping
dead
as
rupert
pulled
a
lever
which
seemed
to
turn
a
barrier
to
the
wind
the
voivode
sat
beside
rupert
but
i
must
say
that
he
seemed
to
hold
on
to
the
bar
in
front
of
him
even
more
firmly
than
rupert
held
to
his
steeringgear
when
they
had
alighted
rupert
greeted
his
cousin
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
bade
him
welcome
to
vissarion
i
see
he
said
you
have
met
teuta
now
you
may
congratulate
me
if
you
wish
mr
melton
made
a
long
rodomontade
about
her
beauty
but
presently
stumbling
about
in
his
speech
said
something
regarding
it
being
unlucky
to
appear
in
graveclothes
rupert
laughed
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
as
he
answered
that
pattern
of
frock
is
likely
to
become
a
national
dress
for
loyal
women
of
the
blue
mountains
when
you
know
something
of
what
that
dress
means
to
us
all
at
present
you
will
understand
in
the
meantime
take
it
that
there
is
not
a
soul
in
the
nation
that
does
not
love
it
and
honour
her
for
wearing
it
to
which
the
cad
replied
oh
indeed
i
thought
it
was
some
preparation
for
a
fancydress
ball
ruperts
comment
on
this
illnatured
speech
was
for
him
quite
grumpily
given
i
should
not
advise
you
to
think
such
things
whilst
you
are
in
this
part
of
the
world
ernest
they
bury
men
here
for
much
less
the
cad
seemed
struck
with
somethingeither
what
rupert
had
said
or
his
manner
of
saying
itfor
he
was
silent
for
several
seconds
before
he
spoke
im
very
tired
with
that
long
journey

ruperts
journal
august
10
1907
when
ernest
said
he
wished
to
retire
it
was
about
the
wisest
thing
he
could
have
said
or
done
and
it
suited
teuta
and
me
down
to
the
ground
i
could
see
that
the
dear
girl
was
agitated
about
something
so
thought
it
would
be
best
for
her
to
be
quiet
and
not
worried
with
being
civil
to
the
bounder
though
he
is
my
cousin
i
cant
think
of
him
as
anything
else
the
voivode
and
i
had
certain
matters
to
attend
to
arising
out
of
the
meeting
of
the
council
and
when
we
were
through
the
night
was
closing
in
when
i
saw
teuta
in
our
own
rooms
she
said
at
once
do
you
mind
dear
if
i
stay
with
aunt
janet
tonight
she
is
very
upset
and
nervous
and
when
i
offered
to
come
to
her
she
clung
to
me
and
cried
with
relief
so
when
i
had
had
some
supper
which
i
took
with
the
voivode
i
came
down
to
my
old
quarters
in
the
garden
room
and
turned
in
early
i
was
awakened
a
little
before
dawn
by
the
coming
of
the
fighting
monk
theophrastos
a
notable
runner
who
had
an
urgent
message
for
me
this
was
the
letter
to
me
given
to
him
by
rooke
he
had
been
cautioned
to
give
it
into
no
other
hand
but
to
find
me
wherever
i
might
be
and
convey
it
personally
when
he
had
arrived
at
plazac
i
had
left
on
the
aeroplane
so
he
had
turned
back
to
vissarion
when
i
read
rookes
report
of
ernest
meltons
abominable
conduct
i
was
more
angry
with
him
than
i
can
say
indeed
i
did
not
think
before
that
that
i
could
be
angry
with
him
for
i
have
always
despised
him
but
this
was
too
much
however
i
realized
the
wisdom
of
rookes
advice
and
went
away
by
myself
to
get
over
my
anger
and
reacquire
my
selfmastery
the
aeroplane
teuta
was
still
housed
on
the
tower
so
i
went
up
alone
and
took
it
out
when
i
had
had
a
spin
of
about
a
hundred
miles
i
felt
better
the
bracing
of
the
wind
and
the
quick
exhilarating
motion
restored
me
to
myself
and
i
felt
able
to
cope
with
master
ernest
or
whatever
else
chagrinable
might
come
along
without
giving
myself
away
as
teuta
had
thought
it
better
to
keep
silence
as
to
ernests
affront
i
felt
i
must
not
acknowledge
it
but
all
the
same
i
determined
to
get
rid
of
him
before
the
day
was
much
older
when
i
had
had
my
breakfast
i
sent
word
to
him
by
a
servant
that
i
was
coming
to
his
rooms
and
followed
not
long
behind
the
messenger
he
was
in
a
suit
of
silk
pyjamas
such
as
not
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
arrayed
in
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
before
i
began
to
speak
he
listened
at
first
amazed
then
disconcerted
then
angry
and
then
cowering
down
like
a
whipped
hound
i
felt
that
it
was
a
case
for
speaking
out
a
bumptious
ass
like
him
who
deliberately
insulted
everyone
he
came
acrossfor
if
all
or
any
of
his
efforts
in
that
way
were
due
to
mere
elemental
ignorance
he
was
not
fit
to
live
but
should
be
silenced
on
sight
as
a
modern
calibandeserved
neither
pity
nor
mercy
to
extend
to
him
fine
feeling
tolerance
and
suchlike
gentlenesses
would
be
to
deprive
the
world
of
them
without
benefit
to
any
so
well
as
i
can
remember
what
i
said
was
something
like
this
ernest
as
you
say
youve
got
to
go
and
to
go
quick
you
understand
i
dare
say
you
look
on
this
as
a
land
of
barbarians
and
think
that
any
of
your
hightoned
refinements
are
thrown
away
on
people
here
well
perhaps
it
is
so
undoubtedly
the
structure
of
the
country
is
rough
the
mountains
may
only
represent
the
glacial
epoch
but
so
far
as
i
can
gather
from
some
of
your
exploitsfor
i
have
only
learned
a
small
part
as
yetyou
represent
a
period
a
good
deal
farther
back
you
seem
to
have
given
our
folk
here
an
exhibition
of
the
playfulness
of
the
hooligan
of
the
saurian
stage
of
development
but
the
blue
mountains
rough
as
they
are
have
come
up
out
of
the
primeval
slime
and
even
now
the
people
aim
at
better
manners
they
may
be
rough
primitive
barbarian
elemental
if
you
will
but
they
are
not
low
down
enough
to
tolerate
either
your
ethics
or
your
taste
my
dear
cousin
your
life
is
not
safe
here
i
am
told
that
yesterday
only
for
the
restraint
exercised
by
certain
offended
mountaineers
on
other
grounds
than
your
own
worth
you
would
have
been
abbreviated
by
the
head
another
day
of
your
fascinating
presence
would
do
away
with
this
restraint
and
then
we
should
have
a
scandal
i
am
a
newcomer
here
myselftoo
new
a
comer
to
be
able
to
afford
a
scandal
of
that
kindand
so
i
shall
not
delay
your
going
believe
me
my
dear
cousin
ernest
roger
halbard
melton
of
humcroft
salop
that
i
am
inconsolable
about
your
resolution
of
immediate
departure
but
i
cannot
shut
my
eyes
to
its
wisdom
at
present
the
matter
is
altogether
amongst
ourselves
and
when
you
have
goneif
it
be
immediatelysilence
will
be
observed
on
all
hands
for
the
sake
of
the
house
wherein
you
are
a
guest
but
if
there
be
time
for
scandal
to
spread
you
will
be
made
whether
you
be
alive
or
dead
a
european
laughingstock
accordingly
i
have
anticipated
your
wishes
and
have
ordered
a
fast
steam
yacht
to
take
you
to
ancona
or
to
whatever
other
port
you
may
desire
the
yacht
will
be
under
the
command
of
captain
desmond
of
one
of
our
battleshipsa
most
determined
officer
who
will
carry
out
any
directions
which
may
be
given
to
him
this
will
insure
your
safety
so
far
as
italian
territory
some
of
his
officials
will
arrange
a
special
carriage
for
you
up
to
flushing
and
a
cabin
on
the
steamer
to
queenboro
a
man
of
mine
will
travel
on
the
train
and
steamer
with
you
and
will
see
that
whatever
you
may
wish
in
the
way
of
food
or
comfort
will
be
provided
of
course
you
understand
my
dear
cousin
that
you
are
my
guest
until
you
arrive
in
london
i
have
not
asked
rooke
to
accompany
you
as
when
he
went
to
meet
you
it
was
a
mistake
indeed
there
might
have
been
a
danger
to
you
which
i
never
contemplateda
quite
unnecessary
danger
i
assure
you
but
happily
admiral
rooke
though
a
man
of
strong
passions
has
wonderful
selfcontrol
admiral
rooke
he
queried
admiral
admiral
certainly
i
replied
but
not
an
ordinary
admiralone
of
many
he
is
the
admiralthe
lord
high
admiral
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
with
sole
control
of
its
expanding
navy
when
such
a
man
is
treated
as
a
valet
there
may
be



but
why
go
into
this
it
is
all
over
i
only
mention
it
lest
anything
of
a
similar
kind
should
occur
with
captain
desmond
who
is
a
younger
man
and
therefore
with
probably
less
selfrepression
i
saw
that
he
had
learned
his
lesson
and
so
said
no
more
on
the
subject
there
was
another
reason
for
his
going
which
i
did
not
speak
of
sir
colin
mackelpie
was
coming
with
his
clansmen
and
i
knew
he
did
not
like
ernest
melton
i
well
remembered
that
episode
of
his
offering
one
finger
to
the
old
gentleman
in
mr
trents
office
and
moreover
i
had
my
suspicions
that
aunt
janets
being
upset
was
probably
in
some
measure
due
to
some
rudeness
of
his
that
she
did
not
wish
to
speak
about
he
is
really
an
impossible
young
man
and
is
far
better
out
of
this
country
than
in
it
if
he
remained
here
there
would
be
some
sort
of
a
tragedy
for
certain
i
must
say
that
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
considerable
relief
that
i
saw
the
yacht
steam
out
of
the
creek
with
captain
desmond
on
the
bridge
and
my
cousin
beside
him
quite
other
were
my
feelings
when
an
hour
after
the
lady
came
flying
into
the
creek
with
the
lord
high
admiral
on
the
bridge
and
beside
him
more
splendid
and
soldierlike
than
ever
sir
colin
mackelpie
mr
bingham
trent
was
also
on
the
bridge
the
general
was
full
of
enthusiasm
regarding
his
regiment
for
in
all
those
he
brought
with
him
and
those
finishing
their
training
at
home
the
force
is
near
the
number
of
a
full
regiment
when
we
were
alone
he
explained
to
me
that
all
was
arranged
regarding
the
noncommissioned
officers
but
that
he
had
held
over
the
question
of
officers
until
we
should
have
had
a
suitable
opportunity
of
talking
the
matter
over
together
he
explained
to
me
his
reasons
which
were
certainly
simple
and
cogent
officers
according
to
him
are
a
different
class
and
accustomed
to
a
different
standard
altogether
of
life
and
living
of
duties
and
pleasures
they
are
harder
to
deal
with
and
more
difficult
to
obtain
there
was
no
use
he
said
in
getting
a
lot
of
failures
with
oldcrusted
ways
of
their
own
importance
we
must
have
young
men
for
our
purposethat
is
men
not
old
but
with
some
experiencemen
of
course
who
know
how
to
behave
themselves
or
else
from
what
little
i
have
seen
of
the
blue
mountaineers
they
wouldnt
last
long
here
if
they
went
on
as
some
of
them
do
elsewhere
i
shall
start
things
here
as
you
wish
me
to
for
i
am
here
my
dear
boy
to
stay
with
you
and
janet
and
we
shall
if
it
be
given
to
us
by
the
almighty
help
to
build
up
together
a
new
nationan
ally
of
britain
who
will
stand
at
least
as
an
outpost
of
our
own
nation
and
a
guardian
of
our
eastern
road
when
things
are
organized
here
on
the
military
side
and
are
going
strong
i
shall
if
you
can
spare
me
run
back
to
london
for
a
few
weeks
whilst
i
am
there
i
shall
pick
up
a
lot
of
the
sort
of
officers
we
want
i
know
that
there
are
loads
of
them
to
be
had
i
shall
go
slowly
however
and
carefully
too
and
every
man
i
bring
back
will
be
recommended
to
me
by
some
old
soldier
whom
i
know
and
who
knows
the
man
he
recommends
and
has
seen
him
work
we
shall
have
i
dare
say
an
army
for
its
size
second
to
none
in
the
world
and
the
day
may
come
when
your
old
country
will
be
proud
of
your
new
one
now
im
off
to
see
that
all
is
ready
for
my
peopleyour
people
now
i
had
had
arrangements
made
for
the
comfort
of
the
clansmen
and
the
women
but
i
knew
that
the
good
old
soldier
would
see
for
himself
that
his
men
were
to
be
comfortable
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
wasislooked
on
as
perhaps
the
general
most
beloved
by
his
men
in
the
whole
british
army
when
he
had
gone
and
i
was
alone
mr
trent
who
had
evidently
been
waiting
for
the
opportunity
came
to
me
when
we
had
spoken
of
my
marriage
and
of
teuta
who
seems
to
have
made
an
immense
impression
on
him
he
said
suddenly
i
suppose
we
are
quite
alone
and
that
we
shall
not
be
interrupted
i
summoned
the
man
outsidethere
is
always
a
sentry
on
guard
outside
my
door
or
near
me
wherever
i
may
beand
gave
orders
that
i
was
not
to
be
disturbed
until
i
gave
fresh
orders
if
i
said
there
be
anything
pressing
or
important
let
the
voivodin
or
miss
mackelpie
know
if
either
of
them
brings
anyone
to
me
it
will
be
all
right
when
we
were
quite
alone
mr
trent
took
a
slip
of
paper
and
some
documents
from
the
bag
which
was
beside
him
he
then
read
out
items
from
the
slip
placing
as
he
did
so
the
documents
so
checked
over

went
on
as
you
may
later
on
wish
to
examine
the
details
of
the
proceedings
i
have
copied
out
the
various
letters
the
originals
of
which
are
put
safely
away
in
my

of
course
they
are
always
available
in
case
you
may
want
them
for
your
present
information
i
shall
give
you
a
rough
synopsis
of
the
proceedings
referring
where
advisable
to
this
paper
on
receipt
of
your
letter
of
instructions
regarding
the
consent
of
the
privy
council
to
your
changing
your
nationality
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
roger
meltons
will
i
put
myself
in
communication
with
the
clerk
of
the
privy
council
informing
him
of
your
wish
to
be
naturalized
in
due
time
to
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
after
some
letters
between
us
i
got
a
summons
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
council
i
attended
as
required
taking
with
me
all
necessary
documents
and
such
as
i
conceived
might
be
advisable
to
produce
if
wanted
the
lord
president
informed
me
that
the
present
meeting
of
the
council
was
specially
summoned
in
obedience
to
the
suggestion
of
the
king
who
had
been
consulted
as
to
his
personal
wishes
on
the
subjectshould
he
have
any
the
president
then
proceeded
to
inform
me
officially
that
all
proceedings
of
the
privy
council
were
altogether
confidential
and
were
not
to
be
made
public
under
any
circumstances
he
was
gracious
enough
to
add
the
circumstances
of
this
case
however
are
unique
and
as
you
act
for
another
we
have
thought
it
advisable
to
enlarge
your
permission
in
the
matter
so
as
to
allow
you
to
communicate
freely
with
your
principal
as
that
gentleman
is
settling
himself
in
a
part
of
the
world
which
has
been
in
the
past
and
may
be
again
united
to
this
nation
by
some
common
interest
his
majesty
wishes
mr
sent
leger
to
feel
assured
of
the
goodwill
of
great
britain
to
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
and
even
of
his
own
personal
satisfaction
that
a
gentleman
of
so
distinguished
a
lineage
and
such
approved
personal
character
is
about
to
bewithin
his
own
scopea
connectinglink
between
the
nations
to
which
end
he
has
graciously
announced
that
should
the
privy
council
acquiesce
in
the
request
of
denaturalization
he
will
himself
sign
the
patent
therefor
the
privy
council
has
therefore
held
private
session
at
which
the
matter
has
been
discussed
in
its
many
bearings
and
it
is
content
that
the
change
can
do
no
harm
but
may
be
of
some
service
to
the
two
nations
we
have
therefore
agreed
to
grant
the
prayer
of
the
applicant
and
the
officials
of
the
council
have
the
matter
of
the
form
of
grant
in
hand
so
you
sir
may
rest
satisfied
that
as
soon
as
the
formalitieswhich
will
of
course
require
the
formal
signing
of
certain
documents
by
the
applicantcan
be
complied
with
the
grant
and
patent
will
obtain
having
made
this
statement
in
formal
style
my
old
friend
went
on
in
more
familiar
way
and
so
my
dear
rupert
all
is
in
hand
and
before
very
long
you
will
have
the
freedom
required
under
the
will
and
will
be
at
liberty
to
take
whatever
steps
may
be
necessary
to
be
naturalized
in
your
new
country
i
may
tell
you
by
the
way
that
several
members
of
the
council
made
very
complimentary
remarks
regarding
you
i
am
forbidden
to
give
names
but
i
may
tell
you
facts
one
old
fieldmarshal
whose
name
is
familiar
to
the
whole
world
said
that
he
had
served
in
many
places
with
your
father
who
was
a
very
valiant
soldier
and
that
he
was
glad
that
great
britain
was
to
have
in
the
future
the
benefit
of
your
fathers
son
in
a
friendly
land
now
beyond
the
outposts
of
our
empire
but
which
had
been
one
with
her
in
the
past
and
might
be
again
so
much
for
the
privy
council
we
can
do
no
more
at
present
until
you
sign
and
have
attested
the
documents
which
i
have
brought
with
me
we
can
now
formally
complete
the
settlement
of
the
vissarion
estates
which
must
be
done
whilst
you
are
a
british
citizen
so
too
with
the
will
the
more
formal
and
complete
document
which
is
to
take
the
place
of
that
short
one
which
you
forwarded
to
me
the
day
after
your
marriage
it
may
be
perhaps
necessary
or
advisable
that
later
on
when
you
are
naturalized
here
you
shall
make
a
new
will
in
strictest
accordance
with
local
law

1907
we
had
a
journey
today
that
was
simply
glorious
we
had
been
waiting
to
take
it
for
more
than
a
week
rupert
not
only
wanted
the
weather
suitable
but
he
had
to
wait
till
the
new
aeroplane
came
home
it
is
more
than
twice
as
big
as
our
biggest
up
to
now
none
of
the
others
could
take
all
the
party
which
rupert
wanted
to
go
when
he
heard
that
the
aero
was
coming
from
whitby
where
it
was
sent
from
leeds
he
directed
by
cable
that
it
should
be
unshipped
at
otranto
whence
he
took
it
here
all
by
himself
i
wanted
to
come
with
him
but
he
thought
it
better
not
he
says
that
brindisi
is
too
busy
a
place
to
keep
anything
quietif
not
secretand
he
wants
to
be
very
dark
indeed
about
this
as
it
is
worked
by
the
new
radium
engine
ever
since
they
found
radium
in
our
own
hills
he
has
been
obsessed
by
the
idea
of
an
aerial
navy
for
our
protection
and
after
todays
experiences
i
think
he
is
right
as
he
wanted
to
survey
the
whole
country
at
a
glimpse
so
that
the
general
scheme
of
defence
might
be
put
in
hand
we
had
to
have
an
aero
big
enough
to
take
the
party
as
well
as
fast
enough
to
do
it
rapidly
and
all
at
once
we
had
in
addition
to
rupert
my
father
and
myself
sir
colin
and
lord
high
admiral
rooke
i
do
like
to
give
that
splendid
old
fellow
his
full
title
the
military
and
naval
experts
had
with
them
scientific
apparatus
of
various
kinds
also
cameras
and
rangefinders
so
that
they
could
mark
their
maps
as
they
required
rupert
of
course
drove
and
i
acted
as
his
assistant
father
who
has
not
yet
become
accustomed
to
aerial
travel
took
a
seat
in
the
centre
which
rupert
had
thoughtfully
prepared
for
him
where
there
is
very
little
motion
i
must
say
i
was
amazed
to
see
the
way
that
splendid
old
soldier
sir
colin
bore
himself
he
had
never
been
on
an
aeroplane
before
but
all
the
same
he
was
as
calm
as
if
he
was
on
a
rock
height
or
motion
did
not
trouble
him
indeed
he
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
all
the
time
the
admiral
is
himself
almost
an
expert
but
in
any
case
i
am
sure
he
would
have
been
unconcerned
just
as
he
was
in
the
crab
as
rupert
has
told
me
we
left
just
after
daylight
and
ran
down
south
when
we
got
to
the
east
of
ilsin
we
kept
slightly
within
the
borderline
and
went
north
or
east
as
it
ran
making
occasional
loops
inland
over
the
mountains
and
back
again
when
we
got
up
to
our
farthest
point
north
we
began
to
go
much
slower
sir
colin
explained
that
for
the
rest
all
would
be
comparatively
plainsailing
in
the
way
of
defence
but
that
as
any
foreign
power
other
than
the
turk
must
attack
from
seaward
he
would
like
to
examine
the
seaboard
very
carefully
in
conjunction
with
the
admiral
whose
advice
as
to
sea
defence
would
be
invaluable
rupert
was
fine
no
one
could
help
admiring
him
as
he
sat
working
his
lever
and
making
the
great
machine
obey
every
touch
he
was
wrapped
up
in
his
work
i
dont
believe
that
whilst
he
was
working
he
ever
thought
of
even
me
he
is
splendid
we
got
back
just
as
the
sun
was
dropping
down
over
the
calabrian
mountains
it
is
quite
wonderful
how
the
horizon
changes
when
you
are
sailing
away
up
high
on
an
aeroplane
rupert
is
going
to
teach
me
how
to
manage
one
all
by
myself
and
when
i
am
fit
he
will
give
me
one
which
he
is
to
have
specially
built
for
me
i
think
i
too
have
done
some
good
workat
least
i
have
got
some
good
ideasfrom
our
journey
today
mine
are
not
of
war
but
of
peace
and
i
think
i
see
a
way
by
which
we
shall
be
able
to
develop
our
country
in
a
wonderful
way
i
shall
talk
the
idea
over
with
rupert
tonight
when
we
are
alone
in
the
meantime
sir
colin
and
admiral
rooke
will
think
their
plans
over
individually
and
tomorrow
morning
together
then
the
next
day
they
too
are
to
go
over
their
idea
with
rupert
and
my
father
and
something
may
be
decided

1907
our
meeting
on
the
subject
of
national
defence
held
this
afternoon
went
off
well
we
were
five
in
all
for
with
permission
of
the
voivode
and
the
two
fightingmen
naval
and
military
i
brought
teuta
with
me
she
sat
beside
me
quite
quietly
and
never
made
a
remark
of
any
kind
till
the
defence
business
had
been
gone
through
both
sir
colin
and
admiral
rooke
were
in
perfect
agreement
as
to
the
immediate
steps
to
be
taken
for
defence
in
the
first
instance
the
seaboard
was
to
be
properly
fortified
in
the
necessary
places
and
the
navy
largely
strengthened
when
we
had
got
thus
far
i
asked
rooke
to
tell
of
the
navy
increase
already
in
hand
whereupon
he
explained
that
as
we
had
found
the
small
battleship
the
lady
of
an
excellent
type
for
coast
defence
acting
only
in
home
waters
and
of
a
size
to
take
cover
where
necessary
at
many
places
on
our
own
shores
we
had
ordered
nine
others
of
the
same
pattern
of
these
the
first
four
were
already
in
hand
and
were
proceeding
with
the
greatest
expedition
the
general
then
supplemented
this
by
saying
that
big
guns
could
be
used
from
points
judiciously
chosen
on
the
seaboard
which
was
in
all
so
short
a
length
that
no
very
great
quantity
of
armament
would
be
required
we
can
have
he
said
the
biggest
guns
of
the
most
perfect
kind
yet
accomplished
and
use
them
from
land
batteries
of
the
most
uptodate
pattern
the
one
serious
proposition
we
have
to
deal
with
is
the
defence
of
the
harbouras
yet
quite
undevelopedwhich
is
known
as
the
blue
mouth
since
our
aerial
journey
i
have
been
to
it
by
sea
with
admiral
rooke
in
the
lady
and
then
on
land
with
the
vladika
who
was
born
on
its
shores
and
who
knows
every
inch
of
it
it
is
worth
fortifyingand
fortifying
well
for
as
a
port
it
is
peerless
in
mediterranean
seas
the
navies
of
the
world
might
ride
in
it
landlocked
and
even
hidden
from
view
seawards
the
mountains
which
enclose
it
are
in
themselves
absolute
protection
in
addition
these
can
only
be
assailed
from
our
own
territory
of
course
voivode
you
understand
when
i
say
our
i
mean
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
for
whose
safety
and
wellbeing
i
am
alone
concerned
any
ship
anchoring
in
the
roads
of
the
blue
mouth
would
have
only
one
needsufficient
length
of
cable
for
its
magnificent
depth
when
proper
guns
are
properly
placed
on
the
steep
cliffs
to
north
and
south
of
the
entrance
and
when
the
rock
islet
between
has
been
armoured
and
armed
as
will
be
necessary
the
mouth
will
be
impregnable
but
we
should
not
depend
on
the
aiming
of
the
entrance
alone
at
certain
salient
pointswhich
i
have
marked
upon
this
maparmourplated
sunken
forts
within
earthworks
should
be
established
there
should
be
covering
forts
on
the
hillsides
and
of
course
the
final
summits
protected
thus
we
could
resist
attack
on
any
side
or
all
sidesfrom
sea
or
land
that
port
will
yet
mean
the
wealth
as
well
as
the
strength
of
this
nation
so
it
will
be
well
to
have
it
properly
protected
this
should
be
done
soon
and
the
utmost
secrecy
observed
in
the
doing
of
it
lest
the
so
doing
should
become
a
matter
of
international
concern
here
rooke
smote
the
table
hard
by
god
that
is
true
it
has
been
the
dream
of
my
own
life
for
this
many
a
year
in
the
silence
which
followed
the
sweet
gentle
voice
of
teuta
came
clear
as
a
bell
may
i
say
a
word
i
am
emboldened
to
as
sir
colin
has
spoken
so
splendidly
and
as
the
lord
high
admiral
has
not
hesitated
to
mention
his
dreaming
i
too
have
had
a
dreama
daydreamwhich
came
in
a
flash
but
no
less
a
dream
for
all
that
it
was
when
we
hung
on
the
aeroplane
over
the
blue
mouth
it
seemed
to
me
in
an
instant
that
i
saw
that
beautiful
spot
as
it
will
some
time
betypical
as
sir
colin
said
of
the
wealth
as
well
as
the
strength
of
this
nation
a
mart
for
the
world
whence
will
come
for
barter
some
of
the
great
wealth
of
the
blue
mountains
that
wealth
is
as
yet
undeveloped
but
the
day
is
at
hand
when
we
may
begin
to
use
it
and
through
that
very
port
our
mountains
and
their
valleys
are
clad
with
trees
of
splendid
growth
virgin
forests
of
priceless
worth
hard
woods
of
all
kinds
which
have
no
superior
throughout
the
world
in
the
rocks
though
hidden
as
yet
is
vast
mineral
wealth
of
many
kinds
i
have
been
looking
through
the
reports
of
the
geological
exports
of
the
commission
of
investigation
which
my
husband
organized
soon
after
he
came
to
live
here
and
according
to
them
our
whole
mountain
ranges
simply
teem
with
vast
quantities
of
minerals
almost
more
precious
for
industry
than
gold
and
silver
are
for
commercethough
indeed
gold
is
not
altogether
lacking
as
a
mineral
when
once
our
work
on
the
harbour
is
done
and
the
place
has
been
made
secure
against
any
attempt
at
foreign
aggression
we
must
try
to
find
a
way
to
bring
this
wealth
of
woods
and
ores
down
to
the
sea
and
then
perhaps
may
begin
the
great
prosperity
of
our
land
of
which
we
have
all
dreamt
she
stopped
all
vibrating
almost
choked
with
emotion
we
were
all
moved
for
myself
i
was
thrilled
to
the
core
her
enthusiasm
was
allsweeping
and
under
its
influence
i
found
my
own
imagination
expanding
out
of
its
experiences
i
spoke
and
there
is
a
way
i
can
see
it
whilst
our
dear
voivodin
was
speaking
the
way
seemed
to
clear
i
saw
at
the
back
of
the
blue
mouth
where
it
goes
deepest
into
the
heart
of
the
cliffs
the
opening
of
a
great
tunnel
which
ran
upward
over
a
steep
slope
till
it
debouched
on
the
first
plateau
beyond
the
range
of
the
encompassing
cliffs
thither
came
by
various
rails
of
steep
gradient
by
timbershoots
and
cablerails
by
aerial
cables
and
precipitating
tubes
wealth
from
over
ground
and
under
it
for
as
our
land
is
all
mountains
and
as
these
tower
up
to
the
clouds
transport
to
the
sea
shall
be
easy
and
of
little
cost
when
once
the
machinery
is
established
as
everything
of
much
weight
goes
downward
the
cars
of
the
main
tunnel
of
the
port
shall
return
upward
without
cost
we
can
have
from
the
mountains
a
head
of
water
under
good
control
which
will
allow
of
endless
hydraulic
power
so
that
the
whole
port
and
the
mechanism
of
the
town
to
which
it
will
grow
can
be
worked
by
it
this
work
can
be
put
in
hand
at
once
so
soon
as
the
place
shall
be
perfectly
surveyed
and
the
engineering
plans
got
ready
we
can
start
on
the
main
tunnel
working
from
the
sealevel
up
so
that
the
cost
of
the
transport
of
material
will
be
almost
nil
this
work
can
go
on
whilst
the
forts
are
building
no
time
need
be
lost
moreover
may
i
add
a
word
on
national
defence
we
are
though
old
in
honour
a
young
nation
as
to
our
place
amongst
great
powers
and
so
we
must
show
the
courage
and
energy
of
a
young
nation
the
empire
of
the
air
is
not
yet
won
why
should
not
we
make
a
bid
for
it
as
our
mountains
are
lofty
so
shall
we
have
initial
power
of
attack
or
defence
we
can
have
in
chosen
spots
amongst
the
clouds
depots
of
war
aeroplanes
with
which
we
can
descend
and
smite
our
enemies
quickly
on
land
or
sea
we
shall
hope
to
live
for
peace
but
woe
to
those
who
drive
us
to
war
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
vissarions
are
a
warlike
race
as
i
spoke
teuta
took
one
of
my
hands
and
held
it
hard
the
old
voivode
his
eyes
blazing
rose
and
stood
beside
me
and
took
the
other
the
two
old
fightingmen
of
the
land
and
the
sea
stood
up
and
saluted
this
was
the
beginning
of
what
ultimately
became
the
national
committee
of
defence
and
development
i
had
other
and
perhaps
greater
plans
for
the
future
in
my
mind
but
the
time
had
not
come
for
their
utterance
to
me
it
seems
not
only
advisable
but
necessary
that
the
utmost
discretion
be
observed
by
all
our
little
group
at
all
events
for
the
present
there
seems
to
be
some
new
uneasiness
in
the
blue
mountains
there
are
constant
meetings
of
members
of
the
council
but
no
formal
meeting
of
the
council
as
such
since
the
last
one
at
which
i
was
present
there
is
constant
coming
and
going
amongst
the
mountaineers
always
in
groups
small
or
large
teuta
and
i
who
have
been
about
very
much
on
the
aeroplane
have
both
noticed
it
but
somehow
wethat
is
the
voivode
and
myselfare
left
out
of
everything
but
we
have
not
said
as
yet
a
word
on
the
subject
to
any
of
the
others
the
voivode
notices
but
he
says
nothing
so
i
am
silent
and
teuta
does
whatever
i
ask
sir
colin
does
not
notice
anything
except
the
work
he
is
engaged
onthe
planning
the
defences
of
the
blue
mouth
his
old
scientific
training
as
an
engineer
and
his
enormous
experience
of
wars
and
siegesfor
he
was
for
nearly
fifty
years
sent
as
military
representative
to
all
the
great
warsseem
to
have
become
directed
on
that
point
he
is
certainly
planning
it
all
out
in
a
wonderful
way
he
consults
rooke
almost
hourly
on
the
maritime
side
of
the
question
the
lord
high
admiral
has
been
a
watcher
all
his
life
and
very
few
important
points
have
ever
escaped
him
so
that
he
can
add
greatly
to
the
wisdom
of
the
defensive
construction
he
notices
i
think
that
something
is
going
on
outside
ourselves
but
he
keeps
a
resolute
silence
what
the
movement
going
on
is
i
cannot
guess
it
is
not
like
the
uneasiness
that
went
before
the
abduction
of
teuta
and
the
voivode
but
it
is
even
more
pronounced
that
was
an
uneasiness
founded
on
some
suspicion
this
is
a
positive
thing
and

meaningof

we
shall
i
suppose
know
all
about
it
in
good

in
the

we
go
on
with
our
work
happily
the
whole
blue
mouth

the
mountains
round
it
are

my
own
property
the
portion
acquired
long
ago
by
uncle
roger
exclusive
of
the
vissarion
estate
i
asked
the
voivode
to
allow
me
to
transfer
it
to
him
but
he
sternly
refused
and
forbade
me
quite
peremptorily
to
ever
open
the
subject
to
him
again
you
have
done
enough
already
he
said
were
i
to
allow
you
to
go
further
i
should
feel
mean
and
i
do
not

you
would
like
your
wifes

to
suffer
that
feeling
after
a
long
life
which
he
has
tried
to
live
in
honour
i
bowed
and
said
no
more
so
there
the
matter
rests
and
i
have
to
take
my

scribe
of
the

by
instruction
of
those
present
when
the
private
meeting
of
various
members
of
the
national
council
had
assembled
in
the
council
hall
of
the
state
house
at

it
was
as
a
preliminary
decided
unanimously
that
now
or
hereafter
no
names
of
those
present
were
to
be
mentioned
and
that
officials
appointed
for
the
purposes
of
this
meeting
should
be
designated
by
office
only
the
names
of
all
being
withheld
the
proceedings
assumed
the
shape
of
a
general
conversation
quite
informal
and
therefore
not
to
be
recorded
the
nett
outcome
was
the
unanimous
expression
of
an
opinion
that
the
time
long
contemplated
by
very
many
persons
throughout
the
nation
had
now
come
when
the
constitution
and
machinery
of
the
state
should
be
changed
that
the
present
form
of
ruling
by
an
irregular
council
was
not
sufficient
and
that
a
method
more
in
accord
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
should
be
adopted
to
this
end
constitutional
monarchy
such
as
that
holding
in
great
britain
seemed
best
adapted
finally
it
was
decided
that
each
member
of
the
council
should
make
a
personal
canvass
of
his
district
talk
over
the
matter
with
his
electors
and
bring
back
to
another
meetingor

it

to

was
discussed
the
consensus
of
opinion
was
entirely
to
the
effect
that
the
voivode
peter

should
if
he
would
accept
the
high
office
be
appointed
it

successor
worthy
in
every
way
to
succeed
to
so
illustrious
a
post
it
was
urged
by
several
speakers
with
general
acquiescence
that
already
mr
sent
legers
services
to
the
state
were
such
that
he
would
be
in
himself
a
worthy
person
to
begin
the
new
dynasty
but
that
as
he
was
now
allied
to
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
it
was
becoming
that
the

born
of

it

by

and
all
of

the

marked
in

the
voivode
peter

as
the

king

entered
the

stood
up
and
for
a
few
seconds
waited
in
respectful
silence
with
heads
bowed
down
then
as
if
by
a
common
impulsefor
no
word
was
spoken
nor
any
signal
giventhey
all
drew
their
handjars
and
stood
to
attentionwith
points
raised
and
edges
of
the
handjars
to
the
front
the
voivode
stood
very
still
he
seemed
much
moved
but
controlled
himself
admirably
the
only
time
when
be
seemed
to
lose
his
selfcontrol
was
when
once
again
with
a
strange
simultaneity
all
present
raised
their
handjars
on
high
and
shouted
hail
peter
king
then
lowering
their
points
till
these
almost
touched
the
ground
they
once
again
stood
with
bowed
heads
when
he
had
quite
mastered
himself
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
spoke
how
can
i
my
brothers
sufficiently
thank
you
and
through
you
the
people
of
the
blue
mountains
for
the
honour
done
to
me
this
day
in
very
truth
it
is
not
possible
and
therefore
i
pray
you
to
consider
it
as
done
measuring
my
gratitude
in
the
greatness
of
your
own
hearts
such
honour
as
you
offer
to
me
is
not
contemplated
by
any
man
in
whose
mind
a
wholesome
sanity
rules
nor
is
it
even
the
dream
of
fervent
imagination
so
great
is
it
that
i
pray
you
men
with
hearts
and
minds
like
my
own
to
extend
to
me
as
a
further
measure
of
your
generosity
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
i
shall
not
want
long
for
even
already
with
the
blaze
of
honour
fresh
upon
me
i
see
the
cool
shadow
of
duty
though
his
substance
is
yet
hardly
visible
give
me
but
an
hour
of
solitudean
hour
at
mostif
it
do
not
prolong
this
your
session
unduly
it
may
be
that
a
lesser
time
will
serve
but
in
any
case
i
promise
you
that
when
i
can
see
a
just
and
fitting
issue
to
my
thought
i
shall
at
once
return
the
president
of
the
council
looked
around
him
and
seeing
everywhere
the
bowing
heads
of
acquiescence
spoke
with
a
reverent
gravity
we
shall
wait
in
patience
whatsoever
time
you
will
and
may
the
god
who
rules
all
worthy
hearts
guide
you
to
his
will
and
so
in
silence
the
voivode
passed
out
of
the
hall
from
my
seat
near
a
window
i
could
watch
him
go
as
with
measured
steps
he
passed
up
the
hill
which
rises
behind
the
state
house
and
disappeared
into
the
shadow
of
the
forest
then
my
work
claimed
me
for
i
wished
to
record
the
proceedings
so
far
whilst
all
was
fresh
in
my
mind
in
silence
as
of
the
dead
the
council
waited
no
man
challenging
opinion
of
his
neighbour
even
by
a
glance
almost
a
full
hour
had
elapsed
when
the
voivode
came
again
to
the
council
moving
with
slow
and
stately
gravity
as
has
always
been
his
wont
since
age
began
to
hamper
the
movement
which
in
youth
had
been
so
notable
the
members
of
the
council
all
stood
up
uncovered
and
so
remained
while
he
made
announcement
of
his
conclusion
he
spoke
slowly
and
as
his
answer
was
to
be
a
valued
record
of
this
land
and
its
race
i
wrote
down
every
word
as
uttered
leaving
here
and
there
space
for
description
or
comment
which
spaces
i
have
since
then
filled
in
lords
of
the
national
council
archbishop
vladika
lords
of
the
council
of
justice
and
of

law

and
my
brothers
all
i
have
since
i
left
you
held
in
the
solitude
of
the
forest
counsel
with
myselfand
with
god
and
he
in
his
gracious
wisdom
has
led
my
thinking
to
that
conclusion
which
was
from
the
first
moment
of
knowledge
of
your
intent
presaged
in
my
heart
brothers
you
knowor
else
a
long
life
has
been
spent
in
vainthat
my
heart
and

are
all
for
the
nationmy
experience
my
life
my
handjar
and
when
all
is
for
her
why
should
i
shrink
to
exercise
on
her
behalf
my
riper
judgment
though
the
same
should
have
to
combat
my
own
ambition
for
ten
centuries
my
race
has
not
failed
in
its
duty
ages
ago
the
men
of
that
time
trusted
in
the
hands
of
my
ancestors
the
kingship
even
as
now
you
their
children
trust
me
but
to
me
it
would
be
base
to
betray
that
trust
even
by
the
smallest
tittle
that
would
i
do
were
i
to
take
the
honour
of
the
crown
which
you
have
tendered
to
me
so
long
as
there
is
another
more
worthy
to
wear
it
were
there
none
other
i
should
place
myself
in
your
hands
and
yield
myself
over
to
blind
obedience
of
your
desires
but
such
an
one
there
is
dear
to
you
already
by
his
own
deeds
now
doubly
dear
to
me
since
he
is
my
son
by
my
daughters
love
he
is
young
whereas
i
am
old
he
is
strong
and
brave
and
true
but
my
days
of
the
usefulness
of
strength
and
bravery
are
over
for
myself
i
have
long
contemplated
as
the
crown
of
my
later
years
a
quiet
life
in
one
of
our
monasteries
where
i
can
still
watch
the
whirl
of
the
world
around
us
on
your
behalf
and
be
a
counsellor
of
younger
men
of
more
active
minds
brothers
we
are
entering
on
stirring
times
i
can
see
the
signs
of
their
coming
all
around
us
north
and
souththe
old
order
and
the
new
are
about
to
clash
and
we
lie
between
the
opposing
forces
true
it
is
that
the
turk
after
warring
for
a
thousand
years
is
fading
into
insignificance
but
from
the
north
where
conquests
spring
have
crept
towards
our
balkans
the
men
of
a
mightier
composite
power
their
march
has
been
steady
and
as
they
came
they
fortified
every
step
of
the
way
now
they
are
hard
upon
us
and
are
already
beginning
to
swallow
up
the
regions
that
we
have
helped
to
win
from
the
dominion
of
mahound
the
austrian
is
at
our
very
gates
beaten
back
by
the
irredentists
of
italy
she
has
so
enmeshed
herself
with
the
great
powers
of
europe
that
she
seems
for
the
moment
to
be
impregnable
to
a
foe
of
our
stature
there
is
but
one
hope
for
usthe
uniting
of
the
balkan
forces
to
turn
a
masterly
front
to
north
and
west
as
well
as
to
south
and
east
is
that
a
task
for
old
hands
to
undertake
no
the
hands
must
be
young
and
supple
and
the
brain
subtle
as
well
as
the
heart
be
strong
of
whomsoever
would
dare
such
an
accomplishment
should
i
accept
the
crown
it
would
only
postpone
the
doing
of
that
which
must
ultimately
be
done
what
avail
would
it
be
if
when
the
darkness
closes
over
me
my
daughter
should
be
queen
consort
to
the
first
king
of
a
new
dynasty
you
know
this
man
and
from
your
record
i
learn
that
you
are
already
willing
to
have
him
as
king
to
follow
me
why
not
begin
with
him
he
comes
of
a
great
nation
wherein
the
principle
of
freedom
is
a
vital
principle
that
quickens
all
things
that
nation
has
more
than
once
shown
to
us
its
friendliness
and
doubtless
the
very
fact
that
an
englishman
would
become
our
king
and
could
carry
into
our
government
the
spirit
and
customs
which
have
made
his
own
country
great
would
do
much
to
restore
the
old
friendship
and
even
to
create
a
new
one
which
would
in
times
of
trouble
bring
british
fleets
to
our
waters
and
british
bayonets
to
support
our
own
handjars
it
is
within
my
own
knowledge
though
as
yet
unannounced
to
you
that
rupert
sent
leger
has
already
obtained
a
patent
signed
by
the
king
of
england
himself
allowing
him
to
be
denaturalized
in
england
so
that
he
can
at
once
apply
for
naturalization
here
i
know
also
that
he
has
brought
hither
a
vast
fortune
by
aid
of
which
he
is
beginning
to
strengthen
our
hands
for
war
in
case
that
sad
eventuality
should
arise
witness
his
late
ordering
to
be
built
nine
other
warships
of
the
class
that
has
already
done
such
effective
service
in
overthrowing
the
turkor
the
pirate
whichever
he
may
have
been
he
has
undertaken
the
defence
of
the
blue
mouth
at
his
own
cost
in
a
way
which
will
make
it
stronger
than
gibraltar
and
secure
us
against
whatever
use
to
which
the
austrian
may
apply
the
vast
forces
already
gathered
in
the
bocche
di
cattaro
he
is
already
founding
aerial
stations
on
our
highest
peaks
for
use
of
the
war
aeroplanes
which
are
being
built
for
him
it
is
such
a
man
as
this
who
makes
a
nation
great
and
right
sure
i
am
that
in
his
hands
this
splendid
land
and
our
noble
freedomloving
people
will
flourish
and
become
a
power
in
the
world
then
brothers
let
me
as
one
to
whom
this
nation
and
its
history
and
its
future
are
dear
ask
you
to
give
to
the
husband
of
my
daughter
the
honour
which
you
would
confer
on
me
for
her
i
can
speak
as
well
as
for
myself
she
shall
suffer
nothing
in
dignity
either
were
i
indeed
king
she
as
my
daughter
would
be
a
princess
of
the
world
as
it
will
be
she
shall
be
companion
and
queen
of
a
great
king
and
her
race
which
is
mine
shall
flourish
in
all
the
lustre
of
the
new
dynasty
therefore
on
all
accounts
my
brothers
for
the
sake
of
our
dear
land
of
the
blue
mountains
make
the
gospodar
rupert
who
has
so
proved
himself
your
king
and
make
me
happy
in
my
retirement
to
the
cloister
when
the
voivode
ceased
to
speak
all
still
remained
silent
and
standing
but
there
was
no
mistaking
their
acquiescence
in
his
most
generous
prayer
the
president
of
the
council
well
interpreted
the
general
wish
when
he
said
lords
of
the
national
council
archbishop
vladika
lords
of
the
councils
of
justice
and
national
law
archimandrites
and
all
who
are
present
is
it
agreed
that
we
prepare
at
leisure
a
fitting
reply
to
the
voivode
peter
of
the
historic
house
of
vissarion
stating
our
agreement
with
his
wish
to
which
there
was
a
unanimous
answer
it
is
he
went
on
further
shall
we
ask
the
gospodar
rupert
of
the
house
of
sent
leger
allied
through
his
marriage
to
the
voivodin
teuta
daughter
and
only
child
of
the
voivode
peter
of
vissarion
to
come
hither
tomorrow
and
that
when
he
is
amongst
us
we
confer
on
him
the
crown
and
kingship
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
again
came
the
answer
it
is
but
this
time
it
rang
out
like
the
sound
of
a
gigantic
trumpet
and
the
handjars
flashed
whereupon
the
session
was
adjourned
for
the
space
of
a
day
the
samecontinued
september
10
1907
when
the
national
council
met
today
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
sat
with
them
but
well
back
so
that
at
first
his
presence
was
hardly
noticeable
after
the
necessary
preliminaries
had
been
gone
through
they
requested
the
presence
of
the
gospodar
rupertmr
rupert
sent
legerwho
was
reported
as
waiting
in
the
chamber
of
the
high
officers
he
at
once
accompanied
back
to
the
hall
the
deputation
sent
to
conduct
him
as
he
made
his
appearance
in
the
doorway
the
councillors
stood
up
there
was
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
the
handjars
flashed
for
an
instant
he
stood
silent
with
lifted
hand
as
though
indicating
that
he
wished
to
speak
so
soon
as
this
was
recognized
silence
fell
on
the
assembly
and
he
spoke
i
pray
you
may
the
voivodin
teuta
of
vissarion
who
has
accompanied
me
hither
appear
with
me
to
hear
your
wishes
there
was
an
immediate
and
enthusiastic
acquiescence
and
after
bowing
his
thanks
he
retired
to
conduct
her
her
appearance
was
received
with
an
ovation
similar
to
that
given
to
gospodar
rupert
to
which
she
bowed
with
dignified
sweetness
she
with
her
husband
was
conducted
to
the
top
of
the
hall
by
the
president
who
came
down
to
escort
them
in
the
meantime
another
chair
had
been
placed
beside
that
prepared
for
the
gospodar
and
these
two
sat
the
president
then
made
the
formal
statement
conveying
to
the
gospodar
rupert
the
wishes
of
the
council
on
behalf
of
the
nation
to
offer
to
him
the
crown
and
kingship
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
the
message
was
couched
in
almost
the
same
words
as
had
been
used
the
previous
day
in
making
the
offer
to
the
voivode
peter
vissarion
only
differing
to
meet
the
special
circumstances
the
gospodar
rupert
listened
in
grave
silence
the
whole
thing
was
manifestly
quite
new
to
him
but
he
preserved
a
selfcontrol
wonderful
under
the
circumstances
when
having
been
made
aware
of
the
previous
offer
to
the
voivode
and
the
declared
wish
of
the
latter
he
rose
to
speak
there
was
stillness
in
the
hall
he
commenced
with
a
few
broken
words
of
thanks
then
he
grew
suddenly
and
strangely
calm
as
he
went
on
but
before
i
can
even
attempt
to
make
a
fitting
reply
i
should
know
if
it
is
contemplated
to
join
with
me
in
this
great
honour
my
dear
wife
the
voivodin
teuta
of
vissarion
who
has
so
splendidly
proved
her
worthiness
to
hold
any
place
in
the
government
of
the
land
i
fain
would




he
was
interrupted
by
the
voivodin
who
standing
up
beside
him
and
holding
his
left
arm
said
do
not
president
and
lords
all
think
me
wanting
in
that
respect
of
a
wife
for
husband
which
in
the
blue
mountains
we
hold
so
dear
if
i
venture
to
interrupt
my
lord
i
am
here
not
merely
as
a
wife
but
as
voivodin
of
vissarion
and
by
the
memory
of
all
the
noble
women
of
that
noble
line
i
feel
constrained
to
a
great
duty
we
women
of
vissarion
in
all
the
history
of
centuries
have
never
put
ourselves
forward
in
rivalry
of
our
lords
well
i
know
that
my
own
dear
lord
will
forgive
me
as
wife
if
i
err
but
i
speak
to
you
the
council
of
the
nation
from
another
ground
and
with
another
tongue
my
lord
does
not
i
fear
know
as
you
do
and
as
i
do
too
that
of
old
in
the
history
of
this
land
when
kingship
was
existent
that
it
was
ruled
by
that
law
of
masculine
supremacy
which
centuries
after
became
known
as
the
lex
salica
lords
of
the
council
of
the
blue
mountains
i
am
a
wife
of
the
blue
mountainsas
a
wife
young
as
yet
but
with
the
blood
of
forty
generations
of
loyal
women
in
my
veins
and
it
would
ill
become
me
whom
my
husband
honourswife
to
the
man
whom
you
would
honourto
take
a
part
in
changing
the
ancient
custom
which
has
been
held
in
honour
for
all
the
thousand
years
which
is
the
glory
of
blue
mountain
womanhood
what
an
example
such
would
be
in
an
age
when
selfseeking
women
of
other
nations
seek
to
forget
their
womanhood
in
the
struggle
to
vie
in
equality
with
men
men
of
the
blue
mountains
i
speak
for
our
women
when
i
say
that
we
hold
of
greatest
price
the
glory
of
our
men
to
be
their
companions
is
our
happiness
to
be
their
wives
is
the
completion
of
our
lives
to
be
mothers
of
their
children
is
our
share
of
the
glory
that
is
theirs
therefore
i
pray
you
men
of
the
blue
mountains
let
me
but
be
as
any
other
wife
in
our
land
equal
to
them
in
domestic
happiness
which
is
our
womans
sphere
and
if
that
priceless
honour
may
be
vouchsafed
to
me
and
i
be
worthy
and
able
to
bear
it
an
exemplar
of
womans
rectitude
with
a
low
modest
graceful
bow
she
sat
down
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
reception
of
her
renunciation
of
queenly
dignity
there
was
more
honour
to
her
in
the
quick
fierce
shout
which
arose
and
the
unanimous
upward
swing
of
the
handjars
than
in
the
wearing
of
any
crown
which
could
adorn
the
head
of
woman
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
gospodar
rupert
was
another
source
of
joy
to
alla
fitting
corollary
to
what
had
gone
before
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
taking
his
wife
in
his
arms
kissed
her
before
all
then
they
sat
down
with
their
chairs
close
bashfully
holding
hands
like
a
pair
of
lovers
then
rupert
arosehe
is
rupert
now
no
lesser
name
is
on
the
lips
of
his
people
henceforth
with
an
intense
earnestness
which
seemed
to
glow
in
his
face
he
said
simply
what
can
i
say
except
that
i
am
in
all
ways
now
and
for
ever
obedient
to
your
wishes
then
raising
his
handjar
and
holding
it
before
him
he
kissed
the
hilt
saying
hereby
i
swear
to
be
honest
and
justto
be

came

i
am
dull

also

and
i
am
convinced
that
at

my

will
have
it
all
its
own
way
the
journey
to
ragusa

thence
to

writ

of
misery

one

heart
let
a
silence

plazac
is
a
miserable
place
there
is
not
a
decent
hotel
in
it
it
was
perhaps
on
this
account
that
the
new
king
rupert
had
erected
for
the
alleged
convenience
of
his
guests
of
the
press
a
series
of
large
temporary
hotels
such
as
were
in
evidence
at
the
st
louis
exposition
here
each
guest
was
given
a
room
to
himself
somewhat
after
the
nature
of
the
cribs
in
a
rowton
house
from
my
first
night
in
it
i
am
able
to
speak
from
experience
of
the
sufferings
of
a
prisoner
of
the
third
class
i
am
however
bound
to
say
that
the
dining
and
reception
rooms
were
though
uncomfortably
plain
adequate
for
temporary
use
happily
we
shall
not
have
to
endure
many
more
meals
here
as
tomorrow
we
all
dine
with
the
king
in
the
state
house
and
as
the
cuisine
is
under
the
control
of
that
cordon
bleu
gaston
de
faux
pas
who
so
long
controlled
the
gastronomic
we
might
almost
say
gastonomic
destinies
of
the
rois
des

in
the
place
vendome
we
may
i
think
look
forward
to
not
going
to
bed
hungry
indeed
the
anticipations
formed
from
a
survey
of
our
meagre
sleeping
accommodation
were
not
realized
at
dinnertime
tonight
to
our
intense
astonishment
an
excellent
dinner
was
served
though
to
be
sure
the
cold
dishes
predominated
a
thing
i
always
find
bad
for
ones
liver
just
as
we
were
finishing
the
king
nominated
came
amongst
us
in
quite
an
informal
way
and
having
bidden
us
a
hearty
welcome
asked
that
we
should
drink
a
glass
of
wine
together
this
we
did
in
an
excellent
if
rather
sweet
glass

king
rupert
nominated
then
asked
us
to
resume
our
seats
he
walked
between
the
tables
now
and
again
recognizing
some
journalistic
friend
whom
he
had
met
early
in
life
in
his
days
of
adventure
the
men
spoken
to
seemed
vastly
pleasedwith
themselves
probably
pretty
bad
form
of
them
i
call
it
for
myself
i
was
glad
i
had
not
previously
met
him
in
the
same
casual
way
as
it
saved
me
from
what
i
should
have
felt
a
humiliationthe
being
patronized
in
that
public
way

been

ancient

ask
our

to

the

of

a
farrago
of
cheap

plazac
does
not
boast
of
a
cathedral
or
any
church
of
sufficient
dimensions
for
a
coronation
ceremony
on
an
adequate
scale
it
was
therefore
decided
by
the
national
council
with
the
consent
of
the
king
that
it
should
be
held
at
the
old
church
of
st
sava
at
vissarionthe
former
home
of
the
queen
accordingly
arrangements
had
been
made
to
bring
thither
on
the
warships
on
the
morning
of
the
coronation
the
whole
of
the
nations
guests
in
st
savas
the
religious
ceremony
would
take
place
after
which
there
would
be
a
banquet
in
the
castle
of
vissarion
the
guests
would
then
return
on
the
warships
to
plazac
where
would
be
held
what
is
called
here
the
national
coronation
in
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
it
was
customary
in
the
old
days
when
there
were
kings
to
have
two
ceremoniesone
carried
out
by
the
official
head
of
the
national
church
the
greek
church
the
other
by
the
people
in
a
ritual
adopted
by
themselves
on
much
the
same
basis
as
the
germanic
folkmoot
the
blue
mountains
is
a
nation
of
strangely
loyal
tendencies
what
was
a
thousand
years
ago
is
to
be
todayso
far
of
course
as
is
possible
under
the
altered
condition
of
things
the
church
of
st
sava
is
very
old
and
very
beautiful
built
in
the
manner
of
old
greek
churches
full
of
monuments
of
bygone
worthies
of
the
blue
mountains
but
of
course
neither
it
nor
the
ceremony
held
in
it
today
can
compare
in
splendour
with
certain
other
ceremonialsfor
instance
the
coronation
of
the
penultimate
czar
in
moscow
of
alfonso
xii
in
madrid
of
carlos
i
in
lisbon
the
church
was
arranged
much
after
the
fashion
of
westminster
abbey
for
the
coronation
of
king
edward
vii
though
of
course
not
so
many
persons
present
nor
so
much
individual
splendour
indeed
the
number
of
those
present
outside
those
officially
concerned
and
the
press
of
the
world
was
very
few
the
most
striking
figure
presentnext
to
king
rupert
who
is
seven
feet
high
and
a
magnificent
manwas
the
queen
consort
teuta
she
sat
in
front
of
a
small
gallery
erected
for
the
purpose
just
opposite
the
throne
she
is
a
strikingly
beautiful
woman
tall
and
finelyformed
with
jetblack
hair
and
eyes
like
black
diamonds
but
with
the
unique
quality
that
there
are
stars
in
them
which
seem
to
take
varied
colour
according
to
each
strong
emotion
but
it
was
not
even
her
beauty
or
the
stars
in
her
eyes
which
drew
the
first
glance
of
all
these
details
showed
on
scrutiny
but
from
afar
off
the
attractive
point
was
her
dress
surely
never
before
did
woman
be
she
queen
or
peasant
wear
such
a
costume
on
a
festive
occasion
she
was
dressed
in
a
white
shroud
and
in
that
only
i
had
heard
something
of
the
story
which
goes
behind
that
strange
costume
and
shall
later
on
send
it
to
you

when
the
procession
entered
the
church
through
the

western
door
the
national
song
of
the
blue
mountains
guide
our
feet
through
darkness
o

was
sung
by
an
unseen
choir
in
which
the
organ
supplemented
by
martial
instruments
joined
the
archbishop
was
robed
in
readiness
before
the
altar
and
close
around
him
stood
the
archimandrites
of
the
four
great
monasteries
the
vladika
stood
in
front
of
the
members
of
the
national
council
a
little
to
one
side
of
this
body
was
a

the
lord

admiral
when
all
was
ready
for
the
ceremonial
act
of
coronation
the
archbishop
raised
his
hand
whereupon
the
music
ceased
turning
around
so
that
he
faced
the
queen
who
thereon
stood
up
the
king
drew
his
handjar
and
saluted
her
in
blue
mountain
fashionthe
point
raised
as
high
possible
and
then
dropped
down

touches

ground

and
all

and
following
the
king
by
the
interval
of
a
second
their
weapons
flashed
out
there
was
something
symbolic
as
well
as
touching
in
this
truly
royal
salute
led
by
the
king
his
handjar
is
a
mighty
blade
and
held
high
in
the
hands
of
a
man
of
his
stature
it
overtowered
everything
in
the
church
it
was
an
inspiriting
sight
no
one
who
saw
will
ever
forget
that
noble
flashing
of
blades
in
the
thousandyearold
salute



the
coronation
was
short
simple
and
impressive
rupert
knelt
whilst
the
archbishop
after
a
short
fervent
prayer
placed
on
his
head
the
bronze
crown
of
the
first
king
of
the
blue
mountains
peter
this
was
handed
to
him
by
the
vladika
to
whom
it
was
brought
from
the
national
treasury
by
a
procession
of
the
high
officers
a
blessing
of
the
new

rising
from

to
draw
his
handjar
and
salute
his
people
after
the
ceremony
in
st

the
procession
was
reformed
and
took
its
way
to
the
castle
of
vissarion
which
is
some
distance
off
across
a
picturesque
creek
bounded
on
either
side
by
noble
cliffs
of
vast
height
the
king
led
the
way
the
queen
walking
with
him
and
holding
his
hand



the
castle
of

is
of
great
antiquity
and
picturesque
beyond
belief
i
am
sending
later
on
as
a
special
article
a
description
of
it



the
coronation
feast
as
it
was
called
on
the
menu
was
held
in
the
great
hall
which
is
of
noble
proportions
i
enclose
copy
of
the
menu
as
our
readers
may
wish
to
know
something
of
the
details
of
such
a
feast
in
this
part
of
the
world
one
feature
of
the
banquet
was
specially
noticeable
as
the
national
officials
were
guests
of
the
king
and
queen
they
were
waited
on
and
served
by
the
king
and
queen
in
person
the
rest
of
the
guests
including
us
of
the
press
were
served
by
the
kings
household
not
the
servantsnone
of
that
cult
were
visiblebut
by
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
court
there
was
only
one
toast
and
that
was
given
by
the
king
all
standing
the
land
of

mountains
and
may
we
all
do
our
duty
to
the
land
we
love
before
drinking
his
mighty
handjar
flashed
out
again
and
in
an
instant
every
table
at
which
the
blue
mountaineers
sat
was
ringed
with
flashing
steel
i
may
add
parenthetically
that
the
handjar
is
essentially
the
national
weapon
i
do
not
know
if
the
blue
mountaineers
take
it
to
bed
with
them
but
they
certainly
wear
it
everywhere
else
its
drawing
seems
to
emphasize
everything
in
national
life

of
unique

the
king
and
queen
the
lords
of
the
council
together
with
the
various
high
ecclesiastics
and
great
officials
went
on
the
yacht

the
lord

man
of
remarkably
masterful
physiognomy
himself

of

at
the
coronation
came
on
the
warship
the
latter
went
fast
but
the
yacht
showed
her
heels
all
the
way
however
the
kings
party
waited
in
the
dock
in
the
blue
mouth
from
this
a
new
cableline
took
us
all
to
the
state
house
at
plazac
here
the
procession
was
reformed
and
wound
its
way
to
a
bare
hill
in
the
immediate
vicinity
the
king
and
queenthe
king
still
wearing
the
ancient
bronze
crown
with
which
the
archbishop
had
invested
him
at
st
savasthe
archbishop
the
vladika
and
the
four
archimandrites
stood
together
at
the
top
of
the
hill
the
king
and
queen
being
of
course
in
the
front
a
courteous
young
gentleman
to
whom
i
had
been
accredited
at
the
beginning
of
the
dayall
guests
were
so
attendedexplained
to
me
that
as
this
was
the
national
as
opposed
to
the
religious
ceremony
the
vladika
who
is
the
official
representative
of
the
laity
took
command
here
the
ecclesiastics
were
put
prominently
forward
simply
out
of
courtesy
in
obedience
to
the
wish
of
the
people
by
whom
they
were
all
greatly
beloved
then
commenced
another
unique
ceremony
which
indeed
might
well
find
a
place
in
our
western
countries
as
far
as
ever
we
could
see
were
masses
of
men
roughly
grouped
not
in
any
uniform
but
all
in
national
costume
and
armed
only
with
the
handjar
in
the
front
of
each
of
these
groups
or
bodies
stood
the
national
councillor
for
that
district
distinguishable
by
his
official
robe
and
chain
there
were
in
all
seventeen
of
these
bodies
these
were
unequal
in
numbers
some
of
them
predominating
enormously
over
others
as
indeed
might
be
expected
in
so
mountainous
a
country
in
all
there
were
present
i
was
told
over
a
hundred
thousand
men
so
far
as
i
can
judge
from
long
experience
of
looking
at
great
bodies
of
men
the
estimate
was
a
just
one
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
see
so
many
for
the
population
of
the
blue
mountains
is
never
accredited
in
books
of
geography
as
a
large
one
when
i
made
inquiry
as
to
how
the
frontier
guard
was
being
for
the
time
maintained
i
was
told
by
the
women
mainly
but
all
the
same
we
have
also
a
male
guard
which
covers
the
whole
frontier
except
that
to
seaward
each
man
has
with
him
six
women
so
that
the
whole
line
is
unbroken
moreover
sir
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
blue
mountains
our
women
are
trained
to
arms
as
well
as
our
menay
and
they
could
give
a
good
account
of
themselves
too
against
any
foe
that
should
assail
us
our
history
shows
what
women
can
do
in
defence
i
tell
you
the
turkish
population
would
be
bigger
today
but
for
the
women
who
on
our
frontier
fought
of
old
for
defence
of
their
homes
no
wonder
this
nation
has
kept
her
freedom
for
a
thousand
years
i
said
at
a
signal
given
by
the
president
of
the
national
council
one
of
the
divisions
moved
forwards
it
was
not
an
ordinary
movement
but
an
intense
rush
made
with
all
the
elan
and
vigour
of
hardy
and
highlytrained
men
they
came
on
not
merely
at
the
double
but
as
if
delivering
an
attack
handjar
in
hand
they
rushed
forward
i
can
only
compare
their
rush
to
an
artillery
charge
or
to
an
attack
of
massed
cavalry
battalions
it
was
my
fortune
to
see
the
former
at
magenta
and
the
latter
at
sadowa
so
that
i
know
what
such
illustration
means
i
may
also
say
that
i
saw
the
relief
column
which
roberts
organized
rush
through
a
town
on
its
way
to
relieve
mafeking
and
no
one
who
had
the
delight
of
seeing
that
inspiring
progress
of
a
flying
army
on
their
way
to
relieve
their
comrades
needs
to
be
told
what
a
rush
of
armed
men
can
be
with
speed
which
was
simply
desperate
they
ran
up
the
hill
and
circling
to
the
left
made
a
ring
round
the
topmost
plateau
where
stood
the
king
when
the
ring
was
complete
the
stream
went
on
lapping
round
and
round
till
the
whole
tally
was
exhausted
in
the
meantime
another
division
had
followed
its
leader
joining
close
behind
the
end
of
the
first
then
came
another
and
another
an
unbroken
line
circled
and
circled
round
the
hill
in
seeming
endless
array
till
the
whole
slopes
were
massed
with
moving
men
dark
in
colour
and
with
countless
glittering
points
everywhere
when
the
whole
of
the
divisions
had
thus
surrounded
the
king
there
was
a
moments
husha
silence
so
still
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
nature
stood
still
also
we
who
looked
on
were
almost
afraid
to
breathe
then
suddenly
without
so
far
as
i
could
see
any
fugleman
or
word
of
command
the
handjars
of
all
that
mighty
array
of
men
flashed
upward
as
one
and
like
thunder
pealed
the
national
cry
the
blue
mountains
and
duty
after
the
cry
there
was
a
strange
subsidence
which
made
the
onlooker
rub
his
eyes
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
mass
of
fighting
men
had
partially
sunk
into
the
ground
then
the
splendid
truth
burst
upon
usthe
whole
nation
was
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
their
chosen
king
who
stood
upright
another
moment
of
silence
as
king
rupert
taking
off
his
crown
held
it
up
in
his
left
hand
and
holding
his
great
handjar
high
in
his
right
cried
in
a
voice
so
strong
that
it
came
ringing
over
that
serried
mass
like
a
trumpet
to
freedom
of
our
nation
and
to
freedom
within
it
i
dedicate
these
and
myself
i
swear
so
saying
he
too
sank
on
his
knees
whilst
we
all
instinctively
uncovered
the
silence
which
followed
lasted
several
seconds
then
without
a
sign
as
though
one
and
all
acted
instinctively
the
whole
body
stood
up
thereupon
was
executed
a
movement
which
with
all
my
experience
of
soldiers
and
war
i
never
saw
equallednot
with
the
russian
royal
guard
saluting
the
czar
at
his
coronation
not
with
an
impi
of
cetewayos
zulus
whirling
through
the
opening
of
a
kraal
for
a
second
or
two
the
whole
mass
seemed
to
writhe
or
shudder
and
then
lo
the
whole
district
divisions
were
massed
again
in
completeness
its
councillors
next
the
king
and
the
divisions
radiating
outwards
down
the
hill
like
wedges
this
completed
the
ceremony
and
everything
broke
up
into
units
later
i
was
told
by
my
official
friend
that
the
kings
last
movementthe
oath
as
he
sank
to
his
kneeswas
an
innovation
of
his
own
all
i
can
say
is
if
in
the
future
and
for
all
time
it
is
not
taken
for
a
precedent
and
made
an
important
part
of
the
patriotic
coronation
ceremony
the
blue
mountaineers
will
prove
themselves
to
be
a
much
more
stupid
people
than
they
seem
at
present
to
be
the
conclusion
of
the
coronation
festivities
was
a
time
of
unalloyed
joy
it
was
the
banquet
given
to
the
king
and
queen
by
the
nation
the
guests
of
the
nation
were
included
in
the
royal
party
it
was
a
unique
ceremony
fancy
a
picnicparty
of
a
hundred
thousand
persons
nearly
all
men
there
must
have
been
made
beforehand
vast
and
elaborate
preparations
ramifying
through
the
whole
nation
each
section
had
brought
provisions
sufficient
for
their
own
consumption
in
addition
to
several
special
dishes
for
the
guesttables
but
the
contribution
of
each
section
was
not
consumed
by
its
own
members
it
was
evidently
a
part
of
the
scheme
that
all
should
derive
from
a
common
stock
so
that
the
feeling
of
brotherhood
and
common
property
should
be
preserved
in
this
monumental
fashion
the
guesttables
were
the
only
tables
to
be
seen
the
bulk
of
the
feasters
sat
on
the
ground
the
tables
were
brought
forward
by
the
men
themselvesno
such
thing
as
domestic
service
was
known
on
this
dayfrom
a
wood
close
at
hand
where
they
and
the
chairs
had
been
placed
in
readiness
the
linen
and
crockery
used
had
been
sent
for
the
purpose
from
the
households
of
every
town
and
village
the
flowers
were
plucked
in
the
mountains
early
that
morning
by
the
children
and
the
gold
and
silver
plate
used
for
adornment
were
supplied
from
the
churches
each
dish
at
the
guesttables
was
served
by
the
men
of
each
section
in
turn
over
the
whole
array
seemed
to
be
spread
an
atmosphere
of
joyousness
of
peace
of
brotherhood
it
would
be
impossible
to
adequately
describe
that
amazing
scene
a
whole
nation
of
splendid
men
surrounding
their
new
king
and
queen
loving
to
honour
and
serve
them
scattered
about
through
that
vast
crowd
were
groups
of
musicians
chosen
from
amongst
themselves
the
space
covered
by
this
titanic
picnic
was
so
vast
that
there
were
few
spots
from
which
you
could
hear
music
proceeding
from
different
quarters
after
dinner
we
all
sat
and
smoked
the
music
became
rather
vocal
than
instrumentalindeed
presently
we
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
any
instrument
at
all
only
knowing
a
few
words
of
balkan
i
could
not
follow
the
meanings
of
the
songs
but
i
gathered
that
they
were
all
legendary
or
historical
to
those
who
could
understand
as
i
was
informed
by
my
tutelary
young
friend
who
stayed
beside
me
the
whole
of
this
memorable
day
we
were
listening
to
the
history
of
the
land
of
the
blue
mountains
in
ballad
form
somewhere
or
other
throughout
that
vast
concourse
each
notable
record
of
ten
centuries
was
being
told
to
eager
ears
it
was
now
late
in
the
day
slowly
the
sun
had
been
dropping
down
over
the
calabrian
mountains
and
the
glamorous
twilight
was
stealing
over
the
immediate
scene
no
one
seemed
to
notice
the
coming
of
the
dark
which
stole
down
on
us
with
an
unspeakable
mystery
for
long
we
sat
still
the
clatter
of
many
tongues
becoming
stilled
into
the
witchery
of
the
scene
lower
the
sun
sank
till
only
the
ruddiness
of
the
afterglow
lit
the
expanse
with
rosy
light
then
this
failed
in
turn
and
the
night
shut
down
quickly
at
last
when
we
could
just
discern
the
faces
close
to
us
a
simultaneous
movement
began
lights
began
to
flash
out
in
places
all
over
the
hillside
at
first
these
seemed
as
tiny
as
glowworms
seen
in
a
summer
wood
but
by
degrees
they
grew
till
the
space
was
set
with
little
circles
of
light
these
in
turn
grew
and
grew
in
both
number
and
strength
flames
began
to
leap
out
from
piles
of
wood
torches
were
lighted
and
held
high
then
the
music
began
again
softly
at
first
but
then
louder
as
the
musicians
began
to
gather
to
the
centre
where
sat
the
king
and
queen
the
music
was
wild
and
semibarbaric
but
full
of
sweet
melody
it
somehow
seemed
to
bring
before
us
a
distant
past
one
and
all
according
to
the
strength
of
our
imagination
and
the
volume
of
our
knowledge
saw
episodes
and
phases
of
bygone
history
come
before
us
there
was
a
wonderful
rhythmic
almost
choric
force
in
the
time
kept
which
made
it
almost
impossible
to
sit
still
it
was
an
invitation
to
the
dance
such
as
i
had
never
before
heard
in
any
nation
or
at
any
time
then
the
lights
began
to
gather
round
once
more
the
mountaineers
took
something
of
the
same
formation
as
at
the
crowning
where
the
royal
party
sat
was
a
level
mead
with
crisp
short
grass
and
round
it
what
one
might
well
call
the
ring
of
the
nation
was
formed
the
music
grew
louder
each
mountaineer
who
had
not
a
lit
torch
already
lighted
one
and
the
whole
rising
hillside
was
a
glory
of
light
the
queen
rose
and
the
king
an
instant
after
as
they
rose
men
stepped
forward
and
carried
away
their
chairs
or
rather
thrones
the
queen
gave
the
king
her
handthis
is
it
seems
the
privilege
of
the
wife
as
distinguished
from
any
other
woman
their
feet
took
the
time
of
the
music
and
they
moved
into
the
centre
of
the
ring
that
dance
was
another
thing
to
remember
won
from
the
haunting
memories
of
that
strange
day
at
first
the
king
and
queen
danced
all
alone
they
began
with
stately
movement
but
as
the
music
quickened
their
feet
kept
time
and
the
swing
of
their
bodies
with
movements
kept
growing
more
and
more
ecstatic
at
every
beat
till
in
true
balkan
fashion
the
dance
became
a
very
agony
of
passionate
movement
at
this
point
the
music
slowed
down
again
and
the
mountaineers
began
to
join
in
the
dance
at
first
slowly
one
by
one
they
joined
in
the
vladika
and
the
higher
priests
leading
then
everywhere
the
whole
vast
crowd
began
to
dance
till
the
earth
around
us
seemed
to
shake
the
lights
quivered
flickered
blazed
out
again
and
rose
and
fell
as
that
hundred
thousand
men
each
holding
a
torch
rose
and
fell
with
the
rhythm
of
the
dance
quicker
quicker
grew
the
music
faster
grew
the
rushing
and
pounding
of
the
feet
till
the
whole
nation
seemed
now
in
an
ecstasy
i
stood
near
the
vladika
and
in
the
midst
of
this
final
wildness
i
saw
him
draw
from
his
belt
a
short
thin
flute
then
he
put
it
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
single
notea
fierce
sharp
note
which
pierced
the
volume
of
sound
more
surely
than
would
the
thunder
of
a
cannonshot
on
the
instant
everywhere
each
man
put
his
torch
under
his
foot
there
was
complete
and
immediate
darkness
for
the
fires
which
had
by
now
fallen
low
had
evidently
been
trodden
out
in
the
measure
of
the
dance
the
music
still
kept
in
its
rhythmic
beat
but
slower
than
it
had
yet
been
little
by
little
this
beat
was
pointed
and
emphasized
by
the
clapping
of
handsat
first
only
a
few
but
spreading
till
everyone
present
was
beating
hands
to
the
slow
music
in
the
darkness
this
lasted
a
little
while
during
which
looking
round
i
noticed
a
faint
light
beginning
to
steal
up
behind
the
hills
the
moon
was
rising
again
there
came
a
note
from
the
vladikas
flutea
single
note
sweet
and
subtle
which
i
can
only
compare
with
a
note
from
a
nightingale
vastly
increased
in
powers
it
too
won
through
the
thunder
of
the
handclaps
and
on
the
second
the
sound
ceased
the
sudden
stillness
together
with
the
darkness
was
so
impressive
that
we
could
almost
hear
our
hearts
beating
and
then
came
through
the
darkness
the
most
beautiful
and
impressive
sound
heard
yet
that
mighty
concourse
without
fugleman
of
any
sort
began
in
low
fervent
voice
to
sing
the
national
anthem
at
first
it
was
of
so
low
tone
as
to
convey
the
idea
of
a
mighty
assembly
of
violinists
playing
with
the
mutes
on
but
it
gradually
rose
till
the
air
above
us
seemed
to
throb
and
quiver
each
syllableeach
wordspoken
in
unison
by
the
vast
throng
was
as
clearly
enunciated
as
though
spoken
by
a
single
voice
guide
our
feet
through
darkness
o
jehovah
this
anthem
sung
out
of
full
hearts
remains
on
our
minds
as
the
last
perfection
of
a
perfect
day
for
myself
i
am
not
ashamed
to
own
that
it
made
me
weep
like
a
child
indeed
i
cannot
write
of
it
now
as
i
would
it
unmans
me
so





in
the
early
morning
whilst
the
mountains
were
still
rather
grey
than
blue
the
cableline
took
us
to
the
blue
mouth
where
we
embarked
in
the
kings
yacht
the
lady
which
took
us
across
the
adriatic
at
a
pace
which
i
had
hitherto
considered
impossible
the
king
and
queen
came
to
the
landing
to
see
us
off
they
stood
together
at
the
righthand
side
of
the
redcarpeted
gangway
and
shook
hands
with
each
guest
as
he
went
on
board
the
instant
the
last
passenger
had
stepped
on
deck
the
gangway
was
withdrawn
the
lord
high
admiral
who
stood
on
the
bridge
raised
his
hand
and
we
swept
towards
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
of
course
all
hats
were
off
and
we
cheered
frantically
i
can
truly
say
that
if
king
rupert
and
queen
teuta
should
ever
wish
to
found
in
the
blue
mountains
a
colony
of
diplomatists
and
journalists
those
who
were
their
guests
on
this
great
occasion
will
volunteer
to
a
man
i
think
old
hempetch
who
is
the
doyen
of
englishspeaking
journalists
voiced
our
sentiments
when
he
said
may
god
bless
them
and
theirs
with
every
grace
and
happiness
and
send
prosperity
to
the
land
and
the
rule
i
think
the
king
and
queen
heard
us
cheer
they
turned
to
look
at
our
flying
ship
again

it
is
so
long
since
i
even
thought
of
this
journal
that
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
i
always
heard
that
a
married
man
is
a
pretty
busy
man
but
since
i
became
one
though
it
is
a
new
life
to
me
and
of
a
happiness
undreamt
of
i
know
what
that
life
is
but
i
had
no
idea
that
this
king
business
was
anything
like
what
it
is
why
it
never
leaves
me
a
moment
at
all
to
myselfor
what
is
worse
to
teuta
if
people
who
condemn
kings
had
only
a
single
month
of
my
life
in
that
capacity
they
would
form
an
opinion
different
from
that
which
they
hold
it
might
be
useful
to
have
a
professor
of
kingship
in
the
anarchists
collegewhenever
it
is
founded
everything
has
gone
on
well
with
us
i
am
glad
to
say
teuta
is
in
splendid
health
though
she
hasbut
only
very
latelypractically
given
up
going
on
her
own
aeroplane
it
was
i
know
a
great
sacrifice
to
make
just
as
she
had
become
an
expert
at
it
they
say
here
that
she
is
one
of
the
best
drivers
in
the
blue
mountainsand
that
is
in
the
world
for
we
have
made
that
form
of
movement
our
own
ever
since
we
found
the
pitchblende
pockets
in
the
great
tunnel
and
discovered
the
simple
process
of
extracting
the
radium
from
it
we
have
gone
on
by
leaps
and
bounds
when
first
teuta
told
me
she
would
aero
no
more
for
a
while
i
thought
she
was
wise
and
backed
her
up
in
it
for
driving
an
aeroplane
is
trying
work
and
hard
on
the
nerves
i
only
learned
then
the
reason
for
her
cautionthe
usual
one
of
a
young
wife
that
was
three
months
ago
and
only
this
morning
she
told
me
she
would
not
go
sailing
in
the
air
even
with
me
till
she
could
do
so
without
riskshe
did
not
mean
risk
to
herself
aunt
janet
knew
what
she
meant
and
counselled
her
strongly
to
stick
to
her
resolution
so
for
the
next
few
months
i
am
to
do
my
airsailing
alone
the
public
works
which
we
began
immediately
after
the
coronation
are
going
strong
we
began
at
the
very
beginning
on
an
elaborate
system
the
first
thing
was
to
adequately
fortify
the
blue
mouth
whilst
the
fortifications
were
being
constructed
we
kept
all
the
warships
in
the
gulf
but
when
the
point
of
safety
was
reached
we
made
the
ships
do
sentrygo
along
the
coast
whilst
we
trained
men
for
service
at
sea
it
is
our
plan
to
take
by
degrees
all
the
young
men
and
teach
them
this
wise
so
that
at
the
end
the
whole
population
shall
be
trained
for
sea
as
well
as
for
land
and
as
we
are
teaching
them
the
airship
service
too
they
will
be
at
home
in
all
the
elementsexcept
fire
of
course
though
if
that
should
become
a
necessity
we
shall
tackle
it
too
we
started
the
great
tunnel
at
the
farthest
inland
point
of
the
blue
mouth
and
ran
it
due
east
at
an
angle
of
45
degrees
so
that
when
complete
it
would
go
right
through
the
first
line
of
hills
coming
out
on
the
plateau
plazac
the
plateau
is
not
very
widehalf
a
mile
at
mostand
the
second
tunnel
begins
on
the
eastern
side
of
it
this
new
tunnel
is
at
a
smaller
angle
as
it
has
to
pierce
the
second
hilla
mountain
this
time
when
it
comes
out
on
the
east
side
of
that
it
will
tap
the
real
productive
belt
here
it
is
that
our
hardwoodtrees
are
finest
and
where
the
greatest
mineral
deposits
are
found
this
plateau
is
of
enormous
length
and
runs
north
arid
south
round
the
great
bulk
of
the
central
mountain
so
that
in
time
when
we
put
up
a
circular
railway
we
can
bring
at
a
merely
nominal
cost
all
sorts
of
material
up
or
down
it
is
on
this
level
that
we
have
built
the
great
factories
for
war
material
we
are
tunnelling
into
the
mountains
where
are
the
great
deposits
of
coal
we
run
the
trucks
in
and
out
on
the
level
and
can
get
perfect
ventilation
with
little
cost
or
labour
already
we
are
mining
all
the
coal
which
we
consume
within
our
own
confines
and
we
can
if
we
wish
within
a
year
export
largely
the
great
slopes
of
these
tunnels
give
us
the
necessary
aid
of
specific
gravity
and
as
we
carry
an
endless
watersupply
in
great
tubes
that
way
also
we
can
do
whatever
we
wish
by
hydraulic
power
as
one
by
one
the
european
and
asiatic
nations
began
to
reduce
their
war
preparations
we
took
over
their
disbanded
workmen
though
our
agents
so
that
already
we
have
a
productive
staff
of
skilled
workmen
larger
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
i
think
myself
that
we
were
fortunate
in
being
able
to
get
ahead
so
fast
with
our
preparations
for
war
manufacture
for
if
some
of
the
great
powers
as
they
call
themselves
knew
the
measure
of
our
present
production
they
would
immediately
try
to
take
active
measures
against
us
in
such
case
we
should
have
to
fight
them
which
would
delay
us
but
if
we
can
have
another
year
untroubled
we
shall
so
far
as
war
material
is
concerned
be
able
to
defy
any
nation
in
the
world
and
if
the
time
may
only
come
peacefully
till
we
have
our
buildings
and
machinery
complete
we
can
prepare
warstores
and
implements
for
the
whole
balkan
nations
and
thenbut
that
is
a
dream
we
shall
know
in
good
time
in
the
meantime
all
goes
well
the
cannon
foundries
are
built
and
active
we
are
already
beginning
to
turn
out
finished
work
of
course
our
first
guns
are
not
very
large
but
they
are
good
the
big
guns
and
especially
siegeguns
will
come
later
and
when
the
great
extensions
are
complete
and
the
boring
and
wirewinding
machines
are
in
working
order
we
can
go
merrily
on
i
suppose
that
by
that
time
the
whole
of
the
upper
plateau
will
be
like
a
manufacturing
townat
any
rate
we
have
plenty
of
raw
material
to
hand
the
haematite
mines
seem
to
be
inexhaustible
and
as
the
raising
of
the
ore
is
cheap
and
easy
by
means
of
our
extraordinary
waterpower
and
as
coal
comes
down
to
the
plateau
by
its
own
gravity
on
the
cableline
we
have
natural
advantages
which
exist
hardly
anywhere
else
in
the
worldcertainly
not
all
together
as
here
that
birds
eye
view
of
the
blue
mouth
which
we
had
from
the
aeroplane
when
teuta
saw
that
vision
of
the
future
has
not
been
in
vain
the
aeroplane
works
are
having
a
splendid
output
the
aeroplane
is
a
large
and
visible
product
there
is
no
mistaking
when
it
is
there
we
have
already
a
large
and
respectable
aerial
fleet
the
factories
for
explosives
are
of
course
far
away
in
bare
valleys
where
accidental
effects
are
minimized
so
too
are
the
radium
works
wherein
unknown
dangers
may
lurk
the
turbines
in
the
tunnel
give
us
all
the
power
we
want
at
present
and
later
on
when
the
new
tunnel
which
we
call
the
water
tunnel
which
is
already
begun
is
complete
the
available
power
will
be
immense
all
these
works
are
bringing
up
our
shipping
and
we
are
in
great
hopes
for
the
future
so
much
for
our
material
prosperity
but
with
it
comes
a
larger
life
and
greater
hopes
the
stress
of
organizing
and
founding
these
great
works
is
practically
over
as
they
are
not
only
selfsupporting
but
largely
productive
all
anxiety
in
the
way
of
national
expenditure
is
minimized
and
more
than
all
i
am
able
to
give
my
unhampered
attention
to
those
matters
of
even
more
than
national
importance
on
which
the
ultimate
development
if
not
the
immediate
strength
of
our
country
must
depend
i
am
well
into
the
subject
of
a
great
balkan
federation
this
it
turns
out
has
for
long
been
the
dream
of
teutas
life
as
also
that
of
the
present
archimandrite
of
plazac
her
father
who
since
i
last
touched
this
journal
having
taken
on
himself
a
holy
life
was
by
will
of
the
church
the
monks
and
the
people
appointed
to
that
great
office
on
the
retirement
of
petrof
vlastimir
such
a
federation
had
long
been
in
the
air
for
myself
i
had
seen
its
inevitableness
from
the
first
the
modern
aggressions
of
the
dual
nation
interpreted
by
her
past
history
with
regard
to
italy
pointed
towards
the
necessity
of
such
a
protective
measure
and
now
when
servia
and
bulgaria
were
used
as
blinds
to
cover
her
real
movements
to
incorporate
with
herself
as
established
the
provinces
once
turkish
which
had
been
entrusted
to
her
temporary
protection
by
the
treaty
of
berlin
when
it
would
seem
that
montenegro
was
to
be
deprived
for
all
time
of
the
hope
of
regaining
the
bocche
di
cattaro
which
she
had
a
century
ago
won
and
held
at
the
point
of
the
sword
until
a
great
power
had
under
a
wrong
conviction
handed
it
over
to
her
neighbouring
goliath
when
the
sandjack
of
novibazar
was
threatened
with
the
fate
which
seemed
to
have
already
overtaken
bosnia
and
herzegovina
when
gallant
little
montenegro
was
already
shut
out
from
the
sea
by
the
octopuslike
grip
of
dalmatia
crouching
along
her
western
shore
when
turkey
was
dwindling
down
to
almost
ineptitude
when
greece
was
almost
a
byword
and
when
albania
as
a
nationthough
still
nominally
subjectwas
of
such
unimpaired
virility
that
there
were
great
possibilities
of
her
future
it
was
imperative
that
something
must
happen
if
the
balkan
race
was
not
to
be
devoured
piecemeal
by
her
northern
neighbours
to
the
end
of
ultimate
protection
i
found
most
of
them
willing
to
make
defensive
alliance
and
as
the
true
defence
consists
in
judicious
attack
i
have
no
doubt
that
an
alliance
so
based
must
ultimately
become
one
for
all
purposes
albania
was
the
most
difficult
to
win
to
the
scheme
as
her
own
complications
with
her
suzerain
combined
with
the
pride
and
suspiciousness
of
her
people
made
approach
a
matter
of
extreme
caution
it
was
only
possible
when
i
could
induce
her
rulers
to
see
that
no
matter
how
great
her
pride
and
valour
the
magnitude
of
northern
advance
if
unchecked
must
ultimately
overwhelm
her
i
own
that
this
mapmaking
was
nervous
work
for
i
could
not
shut
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
german
lust
of
enlargement
lay
behind
austrias
advance
at
and
before
that
time
expansion
was
the
dominant
idea
of
the
three
great
powers
of
central
europe
russia
went
eastward
hoping
to
gather
to
herself
the
rich
northeastern
provinces
of
china
till
ultimately
she
should
dominate
the
whole
of
northern
europe
and
asia
from
the
gulf
of
finland
to
the
yellow
sea
germany
wished
to
link
the
north
sea
to
the
mediterranean
by
her
own
territory
and
thus
stand
as
a
flawless
barrier
across
europe
from
north
to
south
when
nature
should
have
terminated
the
headship
of
the
empirekingdom
she
as
natural
heir
would
creep
southward
through
the
germanspeaking
provinces
thus
austria
of
course
kept
in
ignorance
of
her
neighbours
ultimate
aims
had
to
extend
towards
the
south
she
had
been
barred
in
her
western
movement
by
the
rise
of
the
irredentist
party
in
italy
and
consequently
had
to
withdraw
behind
the
frontiers
of
carinthia
carniola
and
istria
my
own
dream
of
the
new
map
was
to
make
balkathe
balkan
federationtake
in
ultimately
all
south
of
a
line
drawn
from
the

to
aquileia
there
wouldmustbe
difficulties
in
the
carrying
out
of
such
a
scheme
of
course
it
involved
austria
giving
up
dalmatia
istria
and
sclavonia
as
well
as
a
part
of
croatia
and
the
hungarian
banat
on
the
contrary
she
might
look
for
centuries
of
peace
in
the
south
but
it
would
make
for
peace
so
strongly
that
each
of
the
states
impinging
on
it
would
find
it
worth
while
to
make
a
considerable
sacrifice
to
have
it
effected
to
its
own
integers
it
would
offer
a
lasting
settlement
of
interests
which
at
present
conflicted
and
a
share
in
a
new
worldpower
each
of
these
integers
would
be
absolutely
selfgoverning
and
independent
being
only
united
for
purposes
of
mutual
good
i
did
not
despair
that
even
turkey
and
greece
recognizing
that
benefit
and
safety
would
ensue
without
the
destruction
or
even
minimizing
of
individuality
would
sooner
or
later
come
into
the
federation
the
matter
is
already
so
far
advanced
that
within
a
month
the
various
rulers
of
the
states
involved
are
to
have
a
secret
and
informal
meeting
doubtless
some
larger
plan
and
further
action
will
be
then
evolved
it
will
be
an
anxious
time

breathe
more
freely
the
meeting
has
taken
place
here
at
vissarion
nominal
cause
of
meeting
a
huntingparty
in
the
blue
mountains
not
any
formal
affair
not
a
chancellor
or
secretary
of
state
or
diplomatist
of
any
sort
present
all

it
was
after
all
a
real
huntingparty
good
sportsmen
plenty
of
game
lots
of
beaters
everything
organized
properly
and
an
effective
tally
of
results
i
think
we
all
enjoyed
ourselves
in
the
matter
of
sport
and
as
the
political
result
was
absolute
unanimity
of
purpose
and
intention
there
could
be
no
possible
cause
of
complaint
so
it
is
all
decided
everything
is
pacific
there
is
not
a
suggestion
even
of
war
revolt
or
conflicting
purpose
of
any
kind
we
all
go
on
exactly
as
we
are
doing
for
another
year
pursuing
our
own
individual
objects
just
as
at
present
but
we
are
all
to
see
that
in
our
own
households
order
prevails
all
that
is
supposed
to
be
effective
is
to
be
kept
in
good
working
order
and
whatever
is
at
present
not
adequate
to
possibilities
is
to
be
made
so
this
is
all
simply
protective
and
defensive
we
understand
each
other
but
if
any
hulking
stranger
should
undertake
to
interfere
in
our
domestic
concerns
we
shall
all
unite
on

1908
as
rupert
began
to
neglect
his
journal
when
he
was
made
a
king
so
too
i
find
in
myself
a
tendency
to
leave
writing
to
other
people
but
one
thing
i
shall
not
be
content
to
leave
to
otherslittle
rupert
the
baby
of
rupert
and
teuta
is
much
too
precious
a
thing
to
be
spoken
of
except
with
love
quite
independent
of
the
fact
that
he
will
be
in
natural
course
a
king
so
i
have
promised
teuta
that
whatever
shall
be
put
into
this
record
of
the
first
king
of
the
sent
leger
dynasty
relating
to
his
royal
highness
the
crown
prince
shall
only
appear
in
either
her
hand
or
my
own
and
she
has
deputed
the
matter
to
me
our
dear
little
prince
arrived
punctually
and
in
perfect
condition
the
angels
that
carried
him
evidently
took
the
greatest
care
of
him
and
before
they
left
him
they
gave
him
dower
of
all
their
best
he
is
a
dear
like
both
his
father
and
his
mother
and
that
says
everything
my
own
private
opinion
is
that
he
is
a
born
king
he
does
not
know
what
fear
is
and
he
thinks
more
of
everyone
else
than
he
does
of
his
dear
little
self
and
if
those
things
do
not
show
a
truly
royal
nature
i
do
not
know
what
does



teuta
has
read
this
she
held
up
a
warning
finger
and
said
aunt
janet
dear
that
is
all
true
he
is
a
dear
and
a
king
and
an
angel
but
we
mustnt
have
too
much
about
him
just
yet
this
book
is
to
be
about
rupert
so
our
little
man
can
only
be
what
we
shall
call
a
corollary
and
so
it
is
i
should
mention
here
that
the
book
is
teutas
idea
before
little
rupert
came
she
controlled
herself
wonderfully
doing
only
what
was
thought
best
for
her
under
the
circumstances
as
i
could
see
that
it
would
be
a
help
for
her
to
have
some
quiet
occupation
which
would
interest
her
without
tiring
her
i
looked
up
with
his
permission
of
course
all
ruperts
old
letters
and
diaries
and
journals
and
reportsall
that
i
had
kept
for
him
during
his
absences
on
his
adventures
at
first
i
was
a
little
afraid
they
might
harm
her
for
at
times
she
got
so
excited
over
some
things
that
i
had
to
caution
her
here
again
came
in
her
wonderful
selfcontrol
i
think
the
most
soothing
argument
i
used
with
her
was
to
point
out
that
the
dear
boy
had
come
through
all
the
dangers
safely
and
was
actually
with
us
stronger
and
nobler
than
ever
after
we
had
read
over
together
the
whole
matter
several
timesfor
it
was
practically
new
to
me
too
and
i
got
nearly
as
excited
as
she
was
though
i
have
known
him
so
much
longerwe
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
particular
volume
would
have
to
be
of
selected
matter
there
is
enough
of
ruperts
work
to
make
a
lot
of
volumes
and
we
have
an
ambitious
literary
project
of
some
day
publishing
an
edition
de
luxe
of
his
whole
collected
works
it
will
be
a
rare
showing
amongst
the
works
of
kings
but
this
is
to
be
all
about
himself
so
that
in
the
future
it
may
serve
as
a
sort
of
backbone
of
his
personal
history
byandby
we
came
to
a
part
when
we
had
to
ask
him
questions
and
he
was
so
interested
in
teutas
workhe
is
really
bound
up
body
and
soul

his
beautiful
wife

no
wonderthat
we
had
to
take
him
into
full
confidence
he
promised
he
would
help
us
all
he
could
by
giving
us
the
use
of
his
later
journals
and
such
letters
and
papers
as
he
had
kept
privately
he
said
he
would
make
one
conditioni
use
his
own
words
as
you
two
dear
women
are
to
be
my
editors
you
must
promise
to
put
in
everything
exactly
as
i

it
it
will
not
do
to
have
any
fake
about
this
i
do
not
wish
anything
foolish
or
egotistical
toned
down
out
of
affection
for
me
it
was
all
written
in
sincerity
and
if
i
had
faults
they
must
not
be
hidden
if
it
is
to
be
history
it
must
be
true

even
if
it
gives
you

is
his
way
of
showing
contempt
would
be
sure
to

some

that

my
dear
cousin
king
rupert
i
am
honoured
by
the
request
made
on
your
behalf
by
the
lord
high
chancellor
of
your
kingdom
that
i
should
make
a
literary
contribution
to
the
volume
which
my
cousin
queen
teuta
is
with
the
help
of
your
former
governess
miss
mackelpie
compiling
i
am
willing
to
do
so
as
you
naturally
wish
to
have
in
that
work
some
contemporary
record
made
by
the
head
of
the
house
of
melton
with
which
you
are
connected
though
only
on
the
distaff
side
it
is
a
natural
ambition
enough
even
on
the
part
of
a
barbarianor
perhaps
semibarbarianking
and
far
be
it
from
me
as
head
of
the
house
to
deny
you
such
a
coveted
privilege
perhaps
you
may
not
know
that
i
am
now
head
of
the
house
my
father
died
three
days
ago
i
offered
my
mother
the
use
of
the
dower
houseto
the
incumbency
of
which
indeed
she
is
entitled
by
her
marriage
settlement
but
she
preferred
to
go
to
live
at
her
seat
carfax
in
kent
she
went
this
morning
after
the
funeral
in
letting
you
have
the
use
of
my
manuscript
i
make
only
one
stipulation
but
that
i
expect
to
be
rigidly
adhered
to
it
is
that
all
that
i
have
written
be
put
in
the
book
in
extenso
i
do
not
wish
any
record
of
mine
to
be
garbled
to
suit
other
ends
than
those
ostensible
or
whatever
may
be
to
the
honour
of
myself
or
my
house
to
be
burked
i
dare
say
you
have
noticed
my
dear
rupert
that
the
compilers
of
family
histories
often
through
jealousy
alter
matter
that
they
are
allowed
to
use
so
as
to
suit
their
own
purpose
or
minister
to
their
own
vanity
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
that
i
have
had
a
certified
copy
made
by
petter
and
galpin
the
law
stationers
so
that
i
shall
be
able
to
verify
whether
my
stipulation
has
been
honourably
observed
i
am
having
the
book
which
is
naturally
valuable
carefully
packed
and
shall
have
it
forwarded
to
sir
edward
bingham
trent
baronet
which
he
now
isheaven
save

the
attorney
please
see
that
he
returns
it
to
me
and
in
proper
order
he
is
not
to
publish
for
himself
anything
in
it
about
him
a
man
of
that
class
is
apt
to
advertise
the
fact
of
anyone
of
distinction
taking
any
notice
of
him
i
would
bring
out
the
ms

you
myself
and
stay

a

with

i

the

he
calls
it
so
as
to
save
you
trouble
but
i
send
the
book
itself
because
i
am
afraid
that
unless
you
see
his
words
in
his
own
writing
you
will
not
believe
that
he
or
anyone
else
ever
penned
seriously
a
document
so
incriminating
i
am
sure
he
must
have
forgotten
what
he
had
written
for
even
such

dull
dog
as
he
is
could
never
have
made

the
arbitrators
decision
has
been
communicated
to
us
through
the
chancellor
of
the
western
king
who
brought
it
to
us
himself
as
a
special
act
of
friendliness
it
met
with
the
enthusiastic
approval
of
all
the
premier
remained
with
us
during
the
progress
of
the
huntingparty
which
was
one
of
the
most
joyous
occasions
ever
known
we
are
all
of
good
heart
for
the
future
of
the
balkan
races
is
now
assured
the

a
thousand
years
has
ceased
and
we
look
with
hope
for
a
long
and
happy
time
the
chancellor
brought
messages
of
grace
and
courtliness
and
friendliness
to
all
and
when
i
as
spokesman
of
the
party
asked
him
if
we
might
convey
a
request
of
his
majesty
that
he
would
honour
us
by
attending
the
ceremony
of
making
known
formally
the
balkan
settlement
he
answered
that
the
king
had
authorized
him
to
say
that
he
would
if
such
were
wished
by
us
gladly
come
and
that
if
he
should
come
he
would
attend
with
a
fleet
as
an
escort
the
chancellor
also
told
me
from
himself
that
it
might
be
possible
to
have
other
nationalities
represented
on
such
a
great
occasion
by
ambassadors
and
even
fleets
though
the
monarchs
themselves
might
not
be
able
to
attend
he
hinted
that
it
might
be
well
if
i
put
the
matter
in
train
he
evidently
took
it
for
granted
that
though
i
was
only
one
of
several
the
matter
rested
with
mepossibly
he
chose
me
as
the
one
to
whom
to
make
the
confidence
as
i
was
born
a
stranger
as
we
talked
it
over
he
grew
more
enthusiastic
and
finally
said
that
as
the
king
was
taking
the
lead
doubtless
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
friendly
to
him
would
like
to
take
a
part
in
the
ceremony
so
it
is
likely
to
turn
out
practically
an
international
ceremony

our
dear
teuta
is
full
of
the
forthcoming
celebration
of
the
balkan
federation
which
is
to
take
place
this
day
month
although
i
must
say
for
myself
that
the
ceremony
is
attaining
to
such
dimensions
that
i
am
beginning
to
have
a
sort
of
vague
fear
of
some
kind
it
almost
seems
uncanny
rupert
is
working
unceasinglyhas
been
for
some
time
for
weeks
past
he
seems
to
have
been
out
day
and
night
on
his
aeroplane
going
through
and
round
over
the
country
arranging
matters
and
seeing
for
himself
that
what
has
been
arranged
is
being
done
uncle
colin
is
always
about
too
and
so
is
admiral

but
now
teuta
is
beginning
to
go
with
rupert
that
girl
is
simply
fearlessjust
like
rupert
and
they
both
seem
anxious
that
little
rupert
shall
be
the
same
indeed
he
is
the
same
a
few
mornings
ago
rupert
and
teuta
were
about
to
start
just
after
dawn
from
the
top
of
the
castle
little
rupert
was
therehe
is
always
awake
early
and
as
bright
as
a
bee
i
was
holding
him
in
my
arms
and
when
his
mother
leant
over
to
kiss
him
goodbye
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
in
a
way
that
said
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
spoken
take
me
with
you
she
looked
appealingly
at
rupert
who
nodded
and
said
all
right
take
him
darling
he
will
have
to
learn
some
day
and
the
sooner
the
better
the
baby
looking
eagerly
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
same
questioning
in
his
eyes
as
there
is
sometimes
in
the
eyes
of
a
kitten
or
a
puppybut
of
course
with
an
eager
soul
behind
itsaw
that
he
was
going
and
almost
leaped
into
his
mothers
arms
i
think
she
had
expected
him
to
come
for
she
took
a
little
leather
dress
from
margareta
his
nurse
and
flushing
with
pride
began
to
wrap
him
in
it
when
teuta
holding
him
in
her
arms
stepped
on
the
aeroplane
and
took
her
place
in
the
centre
behind
rupert
the
young
men
of
the
crown
princes
guard
raised
a
cheer
amid
which
rupert
pulled
the
levers
and
they
glided
off
into
the
dawn
the
crown
princes
guard
was
established
by
the
mountaineers
themselves
the
day
of
his
birth
ten
of
the
biggest
and
most
powerful
and
cleverest
young
men
of
the
nation
were
chosen
and
were
sworn
in
with
a
very
impressive
ceremony
to
guard
the
young
prince
they
were
to
so
arrange
and
order
themselves
and
matters
generally
that
two
at
least
of
them
should
always
have
him
or
the
place
in
which
he
was
within
their
sight
they
all
vowed
that
the
last
of
their
lives
should
go
before
harm
came
to
him
of
course
teuta
understood
and
so
did
rupert
and
these
young
men
are
the
persons
most
privileged
in
the
whole
castle
they
are
dear
boys
every
one
of
them
and
we
are
all
fond
of
them
and
respect
them
they
simply
idolize
the
baby
ever
since
that
morning
little
rupert
has
unless
it
is
at
a
time
appointed
for
his
sleeping
gone
in
his
mothers
arms
i
think
in
any
other
place
there
would
be
some
state
remonstrance
at
the
whole
royal
family
being
at
once
and
together
in
a
dangerous
position
but
in
the
blue
mountains
danger
and
fear
are
not
thought
ofindeed
they
can
hardly
be
in
their
terminology
and
i
really
think
the
child
enjoys
it
even
more
than
his
parents
he
is
just
like
a
little
bird
that
has
found
the
use
of
his
wings
bless
him
i
find
that
even
i
have
to
study
court
ritual
a
little
so
many
nationalities
are
to
be
represented
at
the
ceremony
of
the
balkan
settlement
and
so
many
kings
and
princes
and
notabilities
of
all
kinds
are
coming
that
we
must
all
take
care
not
to
make
any
mistakes
the
press
alone
would
drive
anyone
silly
rupert
and
teuta
come
and
sit
with
me
sometimes
in
the
evening
when
we
are
all
too
tired
to
work
and
they
rest
themselves
by
talking
matters
over
rupert
says
that
there
will
be
over
five
hundred
reporters
and
that
the
applications
for
permission
are
coming
in
so
fast
that
there
may
be
a
thousand
when
the
day
comes
last
night
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
speaking
of
it
and
said
i
have
an
inspiration
fancy
a
thousand
journalistseach
wanting
to
get
ahead
of
the
rest
and
all
willing
to
invoke
the
powers
of
evil
for
exclusive
information
the
only
man
to
look
after
this
department
is
rooke
he
knows
how
to
deal
with
men
and
as
we
have
already
a
large
staff
to
look
after
the
journalistic
guests
he
can
be
at
the
head
and
appoint
his
own
deputies
to
act
for
him
somewhere
and
sometime
the
keeping
the
peace
will
be
a
matter
of
nerve
and
resolution
and
rooke
is
the
man
for
the
job
we
were
all
concerned
about
one
thing
naturally
important
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
what
robes
was
teuta
to
wear
in
the
old
days
when
there
were
kings
and
queens
they
doubtless
wore
something
gorgeous
or
impressive
but
whatever
it
was
that
they
wore
has
gone
to
dust
centuries
ago
and
there
were
no
illustrated
papers
in
those
primitive
days
teuta
was
talking
to
me
eagerly
with
her
dear
beautiful
brows
all
wrinkled
when
rupert
who
was
reading
a
bulky
document
of
some
kind
looked
up
and
said
of
course
darling
you
will
wear
your
shroud
capital
she
said
clapping
her
hands
like
a
joyous
child
the
very
thing
and
our
people
will
like
it
i
own
that
for
a
moment
i
was
dismayed
it
was
a
horrible
test
of
a
womans
love
and
devotion
at
a
time
when
she
was
entertaining
kings
and
notabilities
in
her
own
houseand
be
sure
they
would
all
be
decked
in
their
fineryto
have
to
appear
in
such
a
garment
a
plain
thing
with
nothing
even
pretty
let
alone
gorgeous
about
it
i
expressed
my
views
to
rupert
for
i
feared
that
teuta
might
be
disappointed
though
she
might
not
care
to
say
so
but
before
he
could
say
a
word
teuta
answered
oh
thank
you
so
much
dear
i
should
love
that
above
everything
but
i
did
not
like
to
suggest
it
lest
you
should
think
me
arrogant
or
presuming
for
indeed
rupert
i
am
very
proud
of
it
and
of
the
way
our
people
look
on
it
why
not
said
rupert
in
his
direct
way
it
is
a
thing
for
us
all
to
be
proud
of
the
nation
has
already
adopted
it
as
a
national
emblemour
emblem
of
courage
and
devotion
and
patriotism
which
will
always
i
hope
be
treasured
beyond
price
by
the
men
and
women
of
our
dynasty
the
nation
that
isof
the
nation
that
is
to
be
later
on
in
the
evening
we
had
a
strange
endorsement
of
the
national
will
a
peoples
deputation
of
mountaineers
without
any
official
notice
or
introduction
arrived
at
the
castle
late
in
the
evening
in
the
manner
established
by
ruperts
proclamation
of
freedom
wherein
all
citizens
were
entitled
to
send
a
deputation
to
the
king
at
will
and
in
private
on
any
subject
of
state
importance
this
deputation
was
composed
of
seventeen
men
one
selected
from
each
political
section
so
that
the
body
as
a
whole
represented
the
entire
nation
they
were
of
all
sorts
of
social
rank
and
all
degrees
of
fortune
but
they
were
mainly
of
the
people
they
spoke
hesitatinglypossibly
because
teuta
or
even
because
i
was
presentbut
with
a
manifest
earnestness
they
made
but
one
requestthat
the
queen
should
on
the
great
occasion
of
the
balkan
federation
wear
as
robes
of
state
the
shroud
that
they
loved
to
see
her
in
the
spokesman
addressing
the
queen
said
in
tones
of
rugged
eloquence
this
is
a
matter
your
majesty
that
the
women
naturally
have
a
say
in
so
we
have
of
course
consulted
them
they
have
discussed
the
matter
by
themselves
and
then
with
us
and
they
are
agreed
without
a
flaw
that
it
will
be
good
for
the
nation
and
for
womankind
that
you
do
this
thing
you
have
shown
to
them
and
to
the
world
at
large
what
women
should
do
what
they
can
do
and
they
want
to
make
in
memory
of
your
great
act
the
shroud
a
garment
of
pride
and
honour
for
women
who
have
deserved
well
of
their
country
in
the
future
it
can
be
a
garment
to
be
worn
only
by
privileged
women
who
have
earned
the
right
but
they
hope
and
we
hope
with
them
that
on
this
occasion
of
our
nation
taking
the
lead
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
all
our
women
may
wear
it
on
that
day
as
a
means
of
showing
overtly
their
willingness
to
do
their
duty
even
to
the
death
and
sohere
he
turned
to
the
kingrupert
we
trust
that
her
majesty
queen
teuta
will
understand
that
in
doing
as
the
women
of
the
blue
mountains
wish
she
will
bind
afresh
to
the
queen
the
loyal
devotion
which
she
won
from
them
as
voivodin
henceforth
and
for
all
time
the
shroud
shall
be
a
dress
of
honour
in
our
land
teuta
looked
all
ablaze
with
love
and
pride
and
devotion
stars
in
her
eyes
shone
like
white
fire
as
she
assured
them
of
the
granting
of
their
request
she
finished
her
little
speech
i
feared
that
if
i
carried
out
my
own
wish
it
might
look
arrogant
but
rupert
has
expressed
the
same
wish
and
now
i
feel
that
i
am
free
to
wear
that
dress
which
brought
me
to
you
and
to
ruperthere
she
beamed
on
him
and
took
his
handfortified
as
i
am
by
your
wishes
and
the
command
of
my
lord
the
king
rupert
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
fondly
before
them
all
saying
tell
your
wives
my
brothers
and
the
rest
of
the
blue
mountain
women
that
that
is
the
answer
of
the
husband
who
loves
and
honours
his
wife
all
the
world
shall
see
at
the
ceremony
of
the
federation
of
balka
that
we
men
love
and
honour
the
women
who
are
loyal
and
can
die
for
duty
and
men
of
the
blue
mountains
some
day
before
long
we
shall
organize
that
great
idea
and
make
it
a
permanent
thingthat
the
order
of
the
shroud
is
the
highest
guerdon
that
a
noblehearted
woman
can
wear

for
a
few
moments
and
came
back
with
the
crown

in
her

the

the
editors
of

have
thought
it
well
to
put
in

order
the

and
descriptions
of
their
special

whom
there
were
present

less

wrote

the
various
parts

are
placed
in

nothing
which
any
of
them

as
to
cover
the
whole

did
us
fine
to
use
a
slang
phrase

pregnant
meaning
there
were
other

arranged

with
plenty

infinitely
more
modest
both

only
with

wore

so
arranged
in
colour

accoutrement

the

this

the

a

today
the
day
appointed
for
the
ceremony
was
auspiciously
fine
even
for
the
blue
mountains
where
at
this
time
of
year
the
weather
is
nearly
always
fine
they
are
early
folk
in
the
blue
mountains
but
today
things
began
to
hum
before
daybreak

were

if
it

dark
we
journalists
were
all
ready
coffee
and
breadandbutter
had
been
thoughtfully
served
early
in
our
sleepingtents
and
an
elaborate
breakfast
was
going
on
all
the
time
in
the
refectory
pavilions
we
had
a
preliminary
look
round
and
then
there
was
a
sort
of
general
pause
for
breakfast
we
took
advantage
of
it
and
attacked
the
sumptuousindeed
memorablemeal
which
was
served
for
us
the
ceremony
was
to
commence
at
noon
but
at
ten
oclock
the
whole
place
was
astirnot
merely
beginning
to
move
but
actually
moving
everybody
taking
their
places
for
the
great
ceremony
as
noon
drew
near
the
excitement
was
intense
and
prolonged
one
by
one
the
various
signatories
to
the
federation
began
to
assemble
they
all
came
by
sea
such
of
them
as
had
seaboards
of
their
own
having
their
fleets
around
them
such
as
had
no
fleets
of
their
own
were
attended
by
at
least
one
of
the
blue
mountain
ironclads
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
never
in
my
life
saw
more
dangerous
craft
than
these
little
warships
of
king
rupert
of
the
blue
mountains
as
they
entered
the
blue
mouth
each
ship
took
her
appointed
station
those
which
carried
the
signatories
being
close
together
in
an
isolated
group
in
a
little
bay
almost
surrounded
by
high
cliffs
in
the
farthest
recesses
of
the
mighty
harbour

yacht
all
the
time
lay
close
inshore
hard
by
the
mouth
of
the
great
tunnel
which
runs
straight
into
the
mountain
from
a
wide
plateau
partly
natural
rock
partly
built
up
with
mighty
blocks
of
stone
here
it
is
i
am
told
that
the
inland
products
are
brought
down
to
the
modern
town
of
plazac
just
as
the
clocks
were
chiming
the
halfhour
before
noon
this
yacht
glided
out
into
the
expanse
of
the
mouth
behind
her
came
twelve
great
barges
royally
decked
and
draped
each
in
the
colour
of
the
signatory

on
each
of
these

entered
with

going
on
the
bridge
whilst
his
suite
remained
on
the
lower
deck
in
the
meantime
whole
fleets
had
been
appearing
on
the
southern
horizon
the
nations
were
sending
their
maritime
quota
to
the
christening
of
balka
in
such
wonderful
order
as
can
only
be
seen
with
squadrons
of
fighting
ships
the
mighty
throng
swept
into
the
blue
mouth
and
took
up
their
stations
in
groups
the
only
armament
of
a
great
power
now
missing
was
that
of
the
western
king
but
there
was
time
indeed
as
the
crowd
everywhere
began
to
look
at
their
watches
a
long
line
of
ships
began
to
spread
up
northward
from
the
italian
coast
they
came
at

speednearly

could
see
the
myriad
of
faceswhite

on
both

the

was
now
alive
with

and
all

without

had
turned
round
and
was
looking
the
other
way
i
looked
across
the
bay
and
up
the
mountain
behinda
mighty
mountain
whose
slopes
run
up
to
the
very
sky
ridge
after
ridge
seeming
like
itself
a
mountain
far
away
on
the
very
top
the
standard
of
the
blue
mountains
was
run
up
on
a
mighty
flagstaff
which
seemed
like
a
shaft
of
light
it
was
two
hundred
feet
high
and
painted
white
and
as
at
the
distance
the
steel
stays
were
invisible
it
towered
up
in
lonely
grandeur
at
its
foot
was
a
dark
mass
grouped
behind
a
white
space
which
i
could
not
make
out
till
i
used
my
fieldglasses
then
i
knew
it
was
king
rupert
and
the
queen
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
mountaineers
they
were
on
the
aero
station
behind
the
platform
of
the
aero
which
seemed
to
shineshine
not
glitteras
though
it
were
overlaid
with
plates
of
gold
again
the
faces
looked
west
the
western
squadron
was
drawing
near
to
the
entrance
of
the
blue
mouth
on
the
bridge
of
the
yacht
stood
the
western
king
in
uniform
of
an
admiral
and
by
him
his
queen
in
a
dress
of
royal
purple
splendid
with
gold
another
glance
at
the
mountaintop
showed
that
it
had
seemed
to
become
alive
a
whole
park
of
artillery
seemed
to
have
suddenly
sprung
to
life
round
each
its
crew
ready
for
action
amongst
the
group
at
the
foot
of
the
flagstaff
we
could
distinguish
king
rupert
his
vast
height
and
bulk
stood
out
from
and
above
all
round
him
close
to
him
was
a
patch
of
white
which
we
understood
to
be
queen
teuta
whom
the
blue
mountaineers
simply
adore
by
this
time
the
armoured
yacht
bearing
all
the
signatories
to
balka
excepting
king
rupert
had
moved
out
towards
the
entrance
and
lay
still
and
silent
waiting
the
coming
of
the
royal
arbitrator
whose
whole
squadron
simultaneously
slowed
down
and
hardly
drifted
in
the
seething
water
of
their
backing
engines
when
the
flag
which
was
in
the
yachts
prow
was
almost
opposite
the
armoured
fort
the
western
king
held
up
a
roll
of
vellum
handed
to
him
by
one
of
his
officers
we
onlookers
held
our
breath
for
in
an
instant
was
such
a
scene
as
we
can
never
hope
to
see
again
at
the
raising
of
the
western
kings
hand
a
gun
was
fired
away
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
where
rose
the
mighty
flagstaff
with
the
standard
of
the
blue
mountains
then
came
the
thunder
of
salute
from
the
guns
bright
flashes
and
reports
which
echoed
down
the
hillsides
in
neverending
sequence
at
the
first
gun
by
some
trick
of
signalling
the
flag
of
the
federated
balka
floated
out
from
the
top
of
the
flagstaff
which
had
been
mysteriously
raised
and
flew
above
that
of
the
blue
mountains
at
the
same
moment
the
figures
of
rupert
and
teuta
sank
they
were
taking
their
places
on
the
aeroplane
an
instant
after
like
a
great
golden
bird
it
seemed
to
shoot
out
into
the
air
and
then
dipping
its
head
dropped
downward
at
an
obtuse
angle
we
could
see
the
king
and
queen
from
time
waist
upwardsthe
king
in
blue
mountain
dress
of
green
the
queen
wrapped
in
her
white
shroud
holding
her
baby
on
her
breast
when
far
out
from
the
mountaintop
and
over
the
blue
mouth
the
wings
and
tail
of
the
great
birdlike
machine
went
up
and
the
aero
dropped
like
a
stone
till
it
was
only
some
few
hundred
feet
over
the
water
then
the
wings
and
tail
went
down
but
with
diminishing
speed
below
the
expanse
of
the
plane
the
king
and
queen
were
now
seen
seated
together
on
the
tiny
steering
platform
which
seemed
to
have
been
lowered
she
sat
behind
her
husband
after
the
manner
of
matrons
of
the
blue
mountains
that
coming
of
that
aeroplane
was
the
most
striking
episode
of
all
this
wonderful
day
after
floating
for
a
few
seconds
the
engines
began
to
work
whilst
the
planes
moved
back
to
their
normal
with
beautiful
simultaneity
there
was
a
golden
aero
finding
its
safety
in
gliding
movement
at
the
same
time
the
steering
platform
was
rising
so
that
once
more
the
occupants
were
not
far
below
but
above
the
plane
they
were
now
only
about
a
hundred
feet
above
the
water
moving
from
the
far
end
of
the
blue
mouth
towards
the
entrance
in
the
open
space
between
the
two
lines
of
the
fighting
ships
of
the
various
nationalities
all
of
which
had
by
now
their
yards
manneda
manoeuvre
which
had
begun
at
the
firing
of
the
first
gun
on
the
mountaintop
as
the
aero
passed
along
all
the
seamen
began
to
cheera
cheering
which
they
kept
up
till
the
king
and
queen
had
come
so
close
to
the
western
kings
vessel
that
the
two
kings
and
queens
could
greet
each
other
the
wind
was
now
beginning
to
blow
westward
from
the
mountaintop
and
it
took
the
sounds
towards
the
armoured
fort
so
that
at
moments
we
could
distinguish
the
cheers
of
the
various
nationalities
amongst
which
more
keen
than
the
others
came
the
soft
ban
zai
of
the
japanese
king
rupert
holding
his
steering
levers
sat
like
a
man
of
marble
behind
him
his
beautiful
wife
clad
in
her
shroud
and
holding
in
her
arms
the
young
crown
prince
seemed
like
a
veritable
statue
the
aero
guided
by
ruperts
unerring
hand
lit
softly
on
the
afterdeck
of
the
western
kings
yacht
and
king
rupert
stepping
on
deck
lifted
from
her
seat
queen
teuta
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
it
was
only
when
the
blue
mountain
king
stood
amongst
other
men
that
one
could
realize
his
enormous
stature
he
stood
literally
head
and
shoulders
over
every
other
man
present
whilst
the
aeroplane
was
giving
up
its
burden
the
western
king
and
his
queen
were
descending
from
the
bridge
the
host
and
hostess
hand
in
handafter
their
usual
fashion
as
it
seemshurried
forward
to
greet
their
guests
the
meeting
was
touching
in
its
simplicity
the
two
monarchs
shook
hands
and
their
consorts
representatives
of
the
foremost
types
of
national
beauty
of
the
north
and
south
instinctively
drew
close
and
kissed
each
other
then
the
hostess
queen
moving
towards
the
western
king
kneeled
before
him
with
the
gracious
obeisance
of
a
blue
mountain
hostess
and
kissed
his
hand
her
words
of
greeting
were
you
are
welcome
sire
to
the
blue
mountains
we
are
grateful
to
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
balka
and
to
you
and
her
majesty
for
giving
us
the
honour
of
your
presence
the
king
seemed
moved
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
ritual
of
great
occasions
the
warmth
and
sincerity
together
with
the
gracious
humility
of
this
old
eastern
custom
touched
him
monarch
though
he
was
of
a
great
land
and
many
races
in
the
far
east
impulsively
he
broke
through
court
ritual
and
did
a
thing
which
i
have
since
been
told
won
for
him
for
ever
a
holy
place
in
the
warm
hearts
of
the
blue
mountaineers
sinking
on
his
knee
before
the
beautiful
shroudclad
queen
he
raised
her
hand
and
kissed
it
the
act
was
seen
by
all
in
and
around
the
blue
mouth
and
a
mighty
cheering
rose
which
seemed
to
rise
and
swell
as
it
ran
far
and
wide
up
the
hillsides
till
it
faded
away
on
the
faroff
mountaintop
where
rose
majestically
the
mighty
flagstaff
bearing
the
standard
of
the
balkan
federation
for
myself
i
can
never
forget
that
wonderful
scene
of
a
nations
enthusiasm
and
the
core
of
it
is
engraven
on
my
memory
that
spotless
deck
typical
of
all
that
is
perfect
in
naval
use
the
king
and
queen
of
the
greatest
nation
of
the
earth
3
received
by
the
newest
king
and
queena
king
and
queen
who
won
empire
for
themselves
so
that
the
former
subject
of
another
king
received
him
as
a
brothermonarch
on
a
historymaking
occasion
when
a
new
worldpower
was
under
his
tutelage
springing
into
existence
the
fair
northern
queen
in
the
arms
of
the
dark
southern
queen
with
the
starry
eyes
the
simple
splendour
of
northern
dress
arrayed
against
that
of
almost
peasant
plainness
of
the
giant
king
of
the
south
but
all
were
eclipsedeven
the
thousand
years
of
royal
lineage
of
the
western
king
ruperts
natural
dower
of
stature
and
the
other
queens
bearing
of
royal
dignity
and
sweetnessby
the
elemental
simplicity
of
teutas
shroud
not
one
of
all
that
mighty
throng
but
knew
something
of
her
wonderful
story
and
not
one
but
felt
glad
and
proud
that
such
a
noble
woman
had
won
an
empire
through
her
own
bravery
even
in
the
jaws
of
the
grave
the
armoured
yacht
with
the
remainder
of
the
signatories
to
the
balkan
federation
drew
close
and
the
rulers
stepped
on
board
to
greet
the
western
king
the
arbitrator
rupert
leaving
his
task
as
personal
host
and
joining
them
he
took
his
part
modestly
in
the
rear
of
the
group
and
made
a
fresh
obeisance
in
his
new
capacity
presently
another
warship
the
balka
drew
close
it
contained
the
ambassadors
of
foreign
powers
and
the
chancellors
and
high
officials
of
the
balkan
nations
it
was
followed
by
a
fleet
of
warships
each
one
representing
a
balkan
power
the
great
western
fleet
lay
at
their
moorings
but
with
the
exception
of
manning
their
yards
took
no
immediate
part
in
the
proceedings
on
the
deck
of
the
newcomer
the
balkan
monarchs
took
their
places
the
officials
of
each
state
grading
themselves
behind
their
monarch
the
ambassadors
formed
a
foremost
group
by
themselves
last
came
the
western
king
quite
alone
save
for
the
two
queens
bearing
in
his
hand
the
vellum
scroll
the
record
of
his
arbitration
this
he
proceeded
to
read
a
polyglot
copy
of
it
having
been
already
supplied
to
every
monarch
ambassador
and
official
present
it
was
a
long
statement
but
the
occasion
was
so
stupendousso
intensethat
the
time
flew
by
quickly
the
cheering
had
ceased
the
moment
the
arbitrator
opened
the
scroll
and
a
veritable
silence
of
the
grave
abounded
when
the
reading
was
concluded
rupert
raised
his
hand
and
on
the
instant
came
a
terrific
salvo
of
cannonshots
from
not
only
the
ships
in
the
port
but
seemingly
all
up
and
over
the
hillsides
away
to
the
very
summit
when
the
cheering
which
followed
the
salute
had
somewhat
toned
down
those
on
board
talked
together
and
presentations
were
made
then
the
barges
took
the
whole
company
to
the
armourclad
fort
in
the
entranceway
to
the
blue
mouth
here
in
front
had
been
arranged
for
the
occasion
platforms
for
the
starting
of
aeroplanes
behind
them
were
the
various
thrones
of
state
for
the
western
king
and
queen
and
the
various
rulers
of
balkaas
the
new
and
completed
balkan
federation
had
becomede
jure
as
well
as
de
facto
behind
were
seats
for
the
rest
of
the
company
all
was
a
blaze
of
crimson
and
gold
we
of
the
press
were
all
expectant
for
some
ceremony
had
manifestly
been
arranged
but
of
all
details
of
it
we
had
been
kept
in
ignorance
so
far
as
i
could
tell
from
the
faces
those
present
were
at
best
but
partially
informed
they
were
certainly
ignorant
of
all
details
and
even
of
the
entire
programme
of
the
day
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
expectation
which
is
not
concerned
in
the
mere
execution
of
foreordered
things
the
aero
on
which
the
king
and
queen
had
come
down
from
the
mountain
now
arrived
on
the
platform
in
the
charge
of
a
tall
young
mountaineer
who
stepped
from
the
steeringplatform
at
once
king
rupert
having
handed
his
queen
who
still
carried
her
baby
into
her
seat
took
his
place
and
pulled
a
lever
the
aero
went
forward
and
seemed
to
fall
head
foremost
off
the
fort
it
was
but
a
dip
however
such
as
a
skilful
diver
takes
from
a
height
into
shallow
water
for
the
plane
made
an
upward
curve
and
in
a
few
seconds
was
skimming
upwards
towards
the
flagstaff
despite
the
wind
it
arrived
there
in
an
incredibly
short
time
immediately
after
his
flight
another
aero
a
big
one
this
time
glided
to
the
platform
to
this
immediately
stepped
a
body
of
ten
tall
finelooking
young
men
the
driver
pulled
his
levers
and
the
plane
glided
out
on
the
track
of
the
king
the
western
king
who
was
noticing
said
to
the
lord
high
admiral
who
had
been
himself
in
command
of
the
ship
of
war
and
now
stood
close
behind
him
who
are
those
men
admiral
the
guard
of
the
crown
prince
your
majesty
they
are
appointed
by
the
nation
tell
me
admiral
have
they
any
special
duties
yes
your
majesty
came
the
answer
to
die
if
need
be
for
the
young
prince
quite
right
that
is
fine
service
but
how
if
any
of
them
should
die
your
majesty
if
one
of
them
should
die
there
are
ten
thousand
eager
to
take
his
place
fine
fine
it
is
good
to
have
even
one
man
eager
to
give
his
life
for
duty
but
ten
thousand
that
is
what
makes
a
nation
when
king
rupert
reached
the
platform
by
the
flagstaff
the
royal
standard
of
the
blue
mountains
was
hauled
up
under
it
rupert
stood
up
and
raised
his
hand
in
a
second
a
cannon
beside
him
was
fired
then
quick
as
thought
others
were
fired
in
sequence
as
though
by
one
prolonged
lightningflash
the
roar
was
incessant
but
getting
less
in
detonating
sound
as
the
distance
and
the
hills
subdued
it
but
in
the
general
silence
which
prevailed
round
us
we
could
hear
the
sound
as
though
passing
in
a
distant
circle
till
finally
the
line
which
had
gone
northward
came
back
by
the
south
stopping
at
the
last
gun
to
southard
of
the
flagstaff
what
was
that
wonderful
circle
asked
the
king
of
the
lord
high
admiral
that
your
majesty
is
the
line
of
the
frontier
of
the
blue
mountains
rupert
has
ten
thousand
cannon
in
line
and
who
fires
them
i
thought
all
the
army
must
be
here
the
women
your
majesty
they
are
on
frontier
duty
today
so
that
the
men
can
come
here
just
at
that
moment
one
of
the
crown
princes
guards
brought
to
the
side
of
the
kings
aero
something
like
a
rubber
ball
on
the
end
of
a
string
the
queen
held
it
out
to
the
baby
in
her
arms
who
grabbed
at
it
the
guard
drew
back
pressing
that
ball
must
have
given
some
signal
for
on
the
instant
a
cannon
elevated
to
perpendicular
was
fired
a
shell
went
straight
up
an
enormous
distance
the
shell
burst
and
sent
out
both
a
light
so
bright
that
it
could
be
seen
in
the
daylight
and
a
red
smoke
which
might
have
been
seen
from
the
heights
of
the
calabrian
mountains
over
in
italy
as
the
shell
burst
the
kings
aero
seemed
once
more
to
spring
from
the
platform
out
into
midair
dipped
as
before
and
glided
out
over
the
blue
mouth
with
a
rapidity
which
to
look
at
took
ones
breath
away
as
it
came
followed
by
the
aero
of
the
crown
princes
guard
and
a
group
of
other
aeros
the
whole
mountainsides
seemed
to
become
alive
from
everywhere
right
away
up
to
the
farthest
visible
mountaintops
darted
aeroplanes
till
a
host
of
them
were
rushing
with
dreadful
speed
in
the
wake
of
the
king
the
king
turned
to
queen
teuta
and
evidently
said
something
for
she
beckoned
to
the
captain
of
the
crown
princes
guard
who
was
steering
the
plane
he
swerved
away
to
the
right
and
instead
of
following
above
the
open
track
between
the
lines
of
warships
went
high
over
the
outer
line
one
of
those
on
board
began
to
drop
something
which
fluttering
down
landed
on
every
occasion
on
the
bridge
of
the
ship
high
over
which
they
then
were
the
western
king
said
again
to
the
gospodar
rooke
the
lord
high
admiral
it
must
need
some
skill
to
drop
a
letter
with
such
accuracy
with
imperturbable
face
the
admiral
replied
it
is
easier
to
drop
bombs
your
majesty
the
flight
of
aeroplanes
was
a
memorable
sight
it
helped
to
make
history
henceforth
no
nation
with
an
eye
for
either
defence
or
attack
can
hope
for
success
without
the
mastery
of
the
air
in
the
meantimeand
after
that
time
toogod

the
nation
that
attacks
balka
or
any
part
of
it
so
long
as
rupert
and
teuta
live
in
the
hearts
of
that
people
and
bind
them
into
an
irresistible
unity

the
dreams
that
are
only
dreams
this
to
be
love
that
your
spirit
to
live
in
a
natural
holiness
with
the
beloved
and
your
bodies
to
be
a
sweet
and
natural
delight
that
shall
be
never
lost
of
a
lovely
mystery
and
shame
to
be
unborn
and
all
things
to
go
wholesome
and
proper
out
of
an
utter
greatness
of
understanding
and
the
man
to
be
an
hero
and
a
child
before
the
woman
and
the
woman
to
be
an
holy
light
of
the
spirit
and
an
utter
companion
and
in
the
same
time
a
glad
possession
unto
the

and
this
doth
be
human
love
for
this
to
be
the
especial
glory
of
love
that
it
doth
make
unto
all
sweetness
and
greatness
and
doth
be
a
fire
burning
all
littleness
so
that
did
all
in
this
world
to
have
met
the
beloved
then
did
wantonness
be
dead
and
there
to
grow
gladness
and
charity
dancing
in
the
years
i
mirdath
the
beautiful
and
i
cannot
touch
her
face
and
i
cannot
touch
her
hair
and
i
kneel
to
empty
shadows
just
memories
of
her
grace
and
her
voice
sings
in
the
winds
and
in
the
sobs
of
dawn
and
among
the
flowers
at
night
and
from
the
brooks
at
sunrise
and
from
the
sea
at
sunset
and
i
answer
with
vain
callings

it
was
the
joy
of
the
sunset
that
brought
us
to
speech
i
was
gone
a
long
way
from
my
house
walking
lonelywise
and
stopping
often
that
i
view
the
piling
upward
of
the
battlements
of
evening
and
to
feel
the
dear
and
strange
gathering
of
the
dusk
come
over
all
the
world
about
me
the
last
time
that
i
paused
i
was
truly
lost
in
a
solemn
joy
of
the
glory
of
the
coming
night
and
maybe
i
laughed
a
little
in
my
throat
standing
there
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
dusk
upon
the
world
and
lo
my
content
was
answered
out
of
the
trees
that
bounded
the
country
road
upon
my
right
and
it
was
so
as
that
some
one
had
said
and
thou
also
in
glad
understanding
that
i
laughed
again
a
little
in
my
throat
as
though
i
had
only
a
halfbelieving
that
any
true
human
did
answer
my
laugh
but
rather
some
sweet
delusion
or
spirit
that
was
tuned
to
my
mood
but
she
spoke
and
called
me
by
my
name
and
when
i
had
gone
to
the
side
of
the
road
that
i
should
see
her
somewhat
and
discover
whether
i
knew
her
i
saw
that
she
was
surely
that
lady
who
for
her
beauty
was
known
through
all
of
that
sweet
county
of
kent
as
lady
mirdath
the
beautiful
and
a
near
neighbour
to
me
for
the
estates
of
her
guardian
abounded
upon
mine
yet
until
that
time
i
had
never
met
her
for
i
had
been
so
oft
and
long
abroad
and
so
much
given
to
my
studies
and
my
exercises
when
at
home
that
i
had
no
further
knowledge
of
her
than
rumour
gave
to
me
odd
time
and
for
the
rest
i
was
well
content
for
as
i
have
given
hint
my
books
held
me
and
likewise
my
exercises
for
i
was
always
an
athlete
and
never
met
the
man
so
quick
or
so
strong
as
i
did
be
save
in
some
fiction
of
a
tale
or
in
the
mouth
of
a
boaster
now
i
stood
instantly
with
my
hat
in
my
hand
and
answered
her
gentle
bantering
so
well
as
i
might
the
while
that
i
peered
intent
and
wondering
at
her
through
the
gloom
for
truly
rumour
had
told
no
tale
to
equal
the
beauty
of
this
strange
maid
who
now
stood
jesting
with
so
sweet
a
spirit
and
claiming
kinship
of
cousinhood
with
me
as
was
truth
now
that
i
did
wake
to
think
and
truly
she
made
no
ado
but
named
me
frank
by
my
lads
name
and
gave
laughter
and
right
to
me
to
name
her
mirdath
and
nothing
less
or
moreat
that
time
and
she
bid
me
then
to
come
up
through
the
hedge
and
make
use
of
a
gap
that
was
her
own
especial
secret
as
she
confessed
when
she
took
odd
leave
with
her
maid
to
some
country
frolic
drest
as
village
maids
but
not
to
deceive
many
as
i
dare
believe
and
i
came
up
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
and
stood
beside
her
and
tall
she
had
seemed
to
me
when
i
looked
up
at
her
and
tall
she
was
in
truth
but
indeed
i
was
a
great
head
taller
and
she
invited
me
then
to
walk
with
her
to
the
house
that
i
meet
her
guardian
and
give
word
to
my
sorrow
that
i
had
so
long
neglected
to
make
call
upon
them
and
truly
her
eyes
to
shine
with
mischief
and
delight
as
she
named
me
so
for
my
amissness
but
indeed
she
grew
sober
in
a
moment
and
she
set
up
her
finger
to
me
to
hush
as
that
she
heard
somewhat
in
the
wood
that
lay
all
the
way
upon
our
right
and
indeed
something
i
heard
too
for
there
was
surely
a
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
anon
a
dead
twig
crackt
with
a
sound
clear
and
sharp
in
the
stillness
and
immediately
there
came
three
men
running
out
of
the
wood
at
me
and
i
called
to
them
sharply
to
keep
off
or
beware
of
harm
and
i
put
the
maid
to
my
back
with
my
left
hand
and
had
my
oak
staff
ready
for
my
use
but
the
three
men
gave
out
no
word
of
reply
but
ran
in
at
me
and
i
saw
somewhat
of
the
gleam
of
knives
and
at
that
i
moved
very
glad
and
brisk
to
the
attack
and
behind
me
there
went
shrill
and
sweet
the
call
of
a
silver
whistle
for
the
maid
was
whistling
for
her
dogs
and
maybe
the
call
was
also
a
signal
to
the
menservants
of
her
house
yet
truly
there
was
no
use
in
help
that
was
yet
to
come
for
the
need
did
be
then
and
instant
and
i
nowise
loath
to
use
my
strength
before
my
sweet
cousin
and
i
stepped
forward
briskly
as
i
have
told
and
the
end
of
my
staff
i
drove
into
the
body
of
the
leftward
man
so
that
he
dropped
like
a
dead
man
and
i
hit
very
sharply
at
the
head
of
another
and
surely
crackt
it
for
him
for
he
made
instantly
upon
the
earth
but
the
third
man
i
met
with
my
fist
and
neither
had
he
any
great
need
of
a
second
blow
but
went
instant
to
join
his
companions
and
the
fight
thus
to
have
ended
before
it
was
even
proper
begun
and
i
laughing
a
little
with
a
proper
pride
to
know
the
bewilderment
that
i
perceived
in
the
way
that
the
lady
mirdath
my
cousin
stood
and
regarded
me
through
the
dusk
of
the
hushed
even
but
indeed
there
was
no
time
left
to
us
before
there
came
bounding
up
three
great
boarhounds
that
had
been
loosed
to
her
whistle
and
she
had
some
ado
to
keep
the
brutes
off
me
and
i
then
to
beat
them
off
the
men
upon
the
earth
lest
they
maul
them
as
they
lay
and
directly
there
was
a
noise
of
men
shouting
and
the
light
of
lanthorns
in
the
night
and
the
footmen
of
the
house
to
come
running
with
lanthorns
and
cudgels
and
knew
not
whether
to
deal
with
me
or
not
in
the
first
moment
even
as
the
dogs
but
when
they
saw
the
men
upon
the
ground
and
learned
my
name
and
saw
me
proper
they
kept
well
their
distance
and
had
no
lack
of
respect
but
indeed
my
sweet
cousin
to
have
the
most
of
any
only
that
she
showed
no
intent
to
keep
distance
of
me
but
to
have
a
new
and
deeper
feeling
of
kinship
than
she
at
first
had
shown
and
the
menservants
asked
what
should
be
done
with
the
footpads
seeing
that
they
were
now
recovering
but
indeed
i
left
the
matter
along
with
some
silver
to
the
servants
and
very
sound
justice
they
dealt
out
to
the
men
for
i
heard
their
cries
a
good
while
after
we
had
gone
away
now
when
we
were
come
up
to
the
hall
my
cousin
must
take
me
in
to
her
guardian
sir
alfred
jarles
an
old
man
and
venerable
that
i
knew
a
little
in
passing
and
because
our
estates
abounded
and
she
praised
me
to
my
face
yet
quaintlywise
and
the
old
man
her
guardian
thanked
me
most
honourably
and
with
a
nice
courtesy
so
that
i
was
a
welcome
housefriend
from
that
time
onward
and
i
stayed
all
that
evening
and
dined
and
afterward
went
out
again
into
the
homegrounds
with
the
lady
mirdath
and
she
more
friendly
to
me
than
ever
any
woman
had
been
and
seemed
to
me
as
that
she
had
known
me
always
and
truly
i
had
the
same
feeling
in
my
heart
towards
her
for
it
was
somehow
as
though
we
knew
each
the
way
and
turn
of
the
other
and
had
a
constant
delight
to
find
this
thing
and
that
thing
to
be
in
common
but
no
surprise
save
that
so
pleasant
a
truth
had
so
natural
a
discovery
and
one
thing
there
was
that
i
perceived
held
the
lady
mirdath
all
that
dear
forenight
and
this
was
indeed
the
way
that
i
had
my
pleasure
so
easy
with
the
three
footpads
and
she
asked
me
plainly
whether
i
was
not
truly
very
strong
and
when
i
laughed
with
young
and
natural
pride
she
caught
my
arm
suddenly
to
discover
for
herself
how
strong
i
might
be
and
surely
she
loosed
it
even
the
more
sudden
and
with
a
little
gasping
of
astonishment
because
it
was
so
great
and
hard
and
afterward
she
walked
by
me
very
silent
and
seeming
thoughtful
but
she
went
never
any
great
way
off
from
me
and
truly
if
the
lady
mirdath
had
a
strange
pleasure
in
my
strength
i
had
likewise
a
constant
wonder
and
marvel
in
her
beauty
that
had
shown
but
the
more
lovely
in
the
candlelight
at
dinner
but
there
were
further
delights
to
me
in
the
days
that
came
for
i
had
happiness
in
the
way
that
she
had
pleasure
of
the
mystery
of
the
evening
and
the
glamour
of
night
and
the
joy
of
dawn
and
all
suchlike
and
one
evening
that
i
ever
remember
as
we
wandered
in
the
parklands
she
began
to
sayhalf
unthinkingthat
it
was
truly
an
elvesnight
and
she
stopped
herself
immediately
as
though
she
thought
i
should
have
no
understanding
but
indeed
i
was
upon
mine
own
familiar
ground
of
inward
delight
and
i
replied
in
a
quiet
and
usual
voice
that
the
towers
of
sleep
would
grow
that
night
and
i
felt
in
my
bones
that
it
was
a
night
to
find
the
giants
tomb
or
the
tree
with
the
great
painted
head
orand
surely
i
stopped
very
sudden
for
she
gripped
me
in
that
moment
and
her
hand
shook
as
she
held
me
but
when
i
would
ask
her
what
ailed
she
bid
me
very
breathless
to
say
on
to
say
on
and
with
a
half
understanding
i
told
her
that
i
had
but
meant
to
speak
of
the
moon
garden
that
was
an
olden
and
happy
fancy
of
mine
and
in
verity
when
i
said
that
the
lady
mirdath
cried
out
something
in
a
strange
low
voice
and
brought
me
to
a
halt
that
she
might
face
me
and
she
questioned
me
very
earnest
and
i
answered
just
so
earnest
as
she
for
i
was
grown
suddenly
to
an
excitement
in
that
i
perceived
she
knew
also
and
in
verity
she
told
me
that
she
had
knowledge
but
had
thought
that
she
was
alone
in
the
world
with
her
knowledge
of
that
strange
land
of
her
dreams
and
now
to
find
that
i
also
had
travelled
in
those
dear
strange
dream
lands
and
truly
the
marvel
of
itthe
marvel
of
it
as
she
to
say
time
and
oft
and
again
as
we
walked
she
gave
out
word
that
there
was
little
wonder
she
had
been
urged
to
call
to
me
that
night
as
she
saw
me
pause
upon
the
road
though
indeed
she
had
learned
of
our
cousinship
before
having
seen
me
go
by
on
my
horse
pretty
oft
and
inquired
concerning
me
and
mayhap
daintily
irked
that
i
had
so
little
heed
of
lady
mirdath
the
beautiful
but
indeed
i
had
thought
of
other
matters
yet
had
been
human
enough
had
i
but
met
her
proper
before
i
see
her
now
you
must
not
think
that
i
was
not
utter
stirred
by
the
wonder
of
this
thing
that
we
had
both
a
dreamful
knowledge
of
the
same
matters
of
which
each
had
thought
none
other
knew
yet
when
i
questioned
more
there
was
much
that
had
been
in
my
fancies
that
was
foreign
to
her
and
likewise
much
that
had
been
familiar
to
her
that
was
of
no
meaning
to
me
but
though
there
was
this
that
brought
a
little
regret
to
us
there
would
be
time
and
again
some
new
thing
that
one
told
that
the
other
knew
and
could
finish
the
telling
of
to
the
gladness
and
amazement
of
both
and
so
shall
you
picture
us
wandering
and
having
constant
speech
so
that
hour
by
hour
we
grew
gladly
aged
in
dear
knowledge
and
sweet
friendship
of
the
other
and
truly
how
the
time
passed
i
know
not
but
there
came
presently
a
hullabaloo
and
the
shouts
of
mens
voices
and
the
baying
of
dogs
and
the
gleam
of
lanthorns
so
that
i
knew
not
what
to
think
until
very
sudden
and
with
a
sweet
and
strange
little
laughter
the
lady
mirdath
to
perceive
that
we
had
missed
the
hours
utter
in
our
converse
so
that
her
guardian
made
uneasy
because
of
the
three
footpads
had
ordered
a
search
and
we
all
that
time
awander
together
in
happy
forgetfulness
and
we
turned
homeward
then
and
came
towards
the
lights
but
indeed
the
dogs
found
us
before
we
were
come
there
and
they
had
grown
to
know
me
now
and
leaped
about
me
barking
very
friendly
and
so
in
a
minute
the
men
had
discovered
us
and
were
gone
back
to
tell
sir
jarles
that
all
was
well
and
this
was
the
way
of
our
meeting
and
the
growing
of
our
acquaintance
and
the
beginning
of
my
great
love
for
mirdath
the
beautiful
now
from
that
time
onward
evening
by
evening
would
i
go
awander
along
the
quiet
and
country
road
that
led
from
my
estate
to
the
estate
of
sir
jarles
and
always
i
went
inward
by
the
hedgegap
and
oft
i
should
find
the
lady
mirdath
walking
in
that
part
of
the
woods
but
always
with
her
great
boarhounds
about
her
for
i
had
begged
that
she
do
this
thing
for
her
sweet
safety
and
she
to
seem
wishful
to
pleasure
me
but
truly
to
be
just
so
oft
utter
perverse
in
diverse
matters
and
to
strive
to
plague
me
as
though
she
would
discover
how
much
i
would
endure
and
how
far
she
might
go
to
anger
me
and
truly
well
i
remember
how
that
one
night
coming
to
the
hedgegap
i
saw
two
countrymaids
come
thence
out
from
the
woods
of
sir
jarles
but
they
were
naught
to
me
and
i
would
have
gone
upward
through
the
gap
as
ever
only
that
as
they
passed
me
they
curtseyed
somewhat
overgraceful
for
rough
wenches
and
i
had
a
sudden
thought
and
came
up
to
them
to
see
them
more
anigh
and
truly
i
thought
the
taller
was
surely
the
lady
mirdath
but
indeed
i
could
not
be
sure
for
when
i
asked
who
she
did
be
she
only
to
simper
and
to
curtsey
again
and
so
was
i
very
natural
all
in
doubt
but
yet
sufficient
in
wonder
having
some
knowledge
of
the
lady
mirdath
to
follow
the
wenches
the
which
i
did
and
they
then
very
speedy
and
sedate
as
though
i
were
some
rackrape
that
they
did
well
to
be
feared
of
alone
at
night
and
so
came
at
last
to
the
village
green
where
a
great
dance
was
afoot
with
torches
and
a
wandering
fiddler
to
set
the
tune
and
ale
in
plenty
and
the
two
to
join
the
dance
and
danced
very
hearty
but
had
only
each
the
other
for
a
partner
and
had
a
good
care
to
avoid
the
torches
and
by
this
i
was
pretty
sure
that
they
were
truly
the
lady
mirdath
and
her
maid
and
so
i
took
chance
when
they
had
danced
somewhat
my
way
to
step
over
to
them
and
ask
boldly
for
a
dance
but
indeed
the
tall
one
answered
simpering
that
she
was
promised
and
immediately
gave
her
hand
to
a
great
hulking
farmerlout
and
went
round
the
green
with
him
and
well
punished
she
was
for
her
waywardness
for
she
had
all
her
skill
to
save
her
pretty
feet
from
his
loutish
stampings
and
very
glad
she
was
to
meet
the
end
of
the
dance
and
i
knew
now
for
certainty
that
it
was
mirdath
the
beautiful
despite
her
plan
of
disguise
and
the
darkness
and
the
wenchs
dress
and
the
footgear
that
marred
her
step
so
great
and
i
walked
across
to
her
and
named
her
whispering
by
name
and
gave
her
plain
word
to
be
done
of
this
unwisdom
and
i
would
take
her
home
but
she
to
turn
from
me
and
she
stamped
her
foot
and
went
again
to
the
lout
and
when
she
had
suffered
another
dance
with
him
she
bid
him
be
her
escort
a
part
of
the
way
the
which
he
was
nothing
loath
of
and
another
lad
that
was
mate
to
him
went
likewise
and
in
a
moment
so
soon
as
they
were
gone
away
from
the
light
of
the
torches
the
rough
hindlads
made
to
set
their
arms
about
the
waists
of
the
two
wenches
not
wetting
who
they
had
for
companions
and
the
lady
mirdath
was
no
longer
able
to
endure
and
cried
out
in
her
sudden
fear
and
disgust
and
struck
the
rough
hind
that
embraced
her
so
hard
that
he
loosed
her
a
moment
swearing
great
oaths
and
directly
he
came
back
to
her
again
and
had
her
in
a
moment
to
kiss
her
and
she
loathing
him
to
the
very
death
beat
him
madly
in
the
face
with
her
hands
but
to
no
end
only
that
i
was
close
upon
them
and
in
that
moment
she
screamed
my
name
aloud
and
i
caught
the
poor
lout
and
hit
him
once
but
not
to
harm
him
overmuch
yet
to
give
him
a
long
memory
of
me
and
afterward
i
threw
him
into
the
side
of
the
road
but
the
second
hind
having
heard
my
name
loosed
from
the
tiringmaid
and
ran
for
his
life
and
indeed
my
strength
was
known
all
about
that
part
and
i
caught
mirdath
the
beautiful
by
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
very
soundly
in
my
anger
and
afterward
i
sent
the
maid
onward
and
she
having
no
word
from
her
mistress
to
stay
went
forward
a
little
and
in
this
fashion
we
came
at
last
to
the
hedgegap
with
the
lady
mirdath
very
hushed
but
yet
walking
anigh
to
me
as
that
she
had
some
secret
pleasure
of
my
nearness
and
i
led
her
through
the
gap
and
so
homeward
to
the
hall
and
there
bid
her
goodnight
at
a
side
door
that
she
held
the
key
of
and
truly
she
bid
me
goodnight
in
an
utter
quiet
voice
and
was
almost
as
that
she
had
no
haste
to
be
gone
from
me
that
night
yet
when
i
met
her
on
the
morrow
she
was
full
of
a
constant
impudence
to
me
so
that
having
her
alone
to
myself
when
the
dusk
was
come
i
asked
her
why
she
would
never
be
done
of
her
waywardness
because
that
i
ached
to
have
companionship
of
her
and
instead
she
denied
my
need
and
at
that
she
was
at
once
very
gentle
and
full
of
a
sweet
and
winsome
understanding
and
surely
knew
that
i
wished
to
be
rested
for
she
brought
out
her
harp
and
played
me
dear
olden
melodies
of
our
childhooddays
all
that
evening
and
so
had
my
love
for
her
the
more
intent
and
glad
and
she
saw
me
that
night
to
the
hedgegap
having
her
three
great
boarhounds
with
her
to
company
her
home
again
but
indeed
i
followed
her
afterwards
very
silent
until
i
saw
her
safe
into
the
hall
for
i
would
not
have
her
alone
in
the
night
though
she
believed
that
i
was
then
far
away
on
the
country
road
and
as
she
walked
with
her
dogs
one
or
another
would
run
back
to
me
to
nose
against
me
friendlywise
but
i
sent
them
off
again
very
quiet
and
she
had
no
knowledge
of
aught
for
she
to
go
singing
a
lovesong
quietly
all
the
way
home
but
whether
she
loved
me
i
could
not
tell
though
she
had
a
nice
affection
for
me
now
on
the
following
evening
i
went
somewhat
early
to
the
gap
and
lo
who
should
be
standing
in
the
gap
talking
to
the
lady
mirdath
but
a
very
cleverdrest
man
that
had
a
look
of
the
court
about
him
and
he
when
i
approached
made
no
way
for
me
through
the
gap
but
stood
firm
and
eyed
me
very
insolent
so
that
i
put
out
my
hand
and
lifted
him
from
my
way
and
lo
the
lady
mirdath
turned
a
bitterness
of
speech
upon
me
that
gave
me
an
utter
pain
and
astonishment
so
that
i
was
assured
in
a
moment
that
she
had
no
true
love
for
me
or
she
had
never
striven
so
to
put
me
to
shame
before
the
stranger
and
named
me
uncouth
and
brutal
to
a
smaller
man
and
indeed
you
shall
perceive
how
i
was
in
my
heart
in
that
moment
and
i
saw
that
there
was
some
seeming
of
justice
in
what
the
lady
mirdath
said
but
yet
might
the
man
have
shown
a
better
spirit
and
moreover
mirdath
the
beautiful
had
no
true
call
to
shame
me
her
true
friend
and
cousin
before
this
stranger
yet
did
i
not
stop
to
argue
but
bowed
very
low
to
the
lady
mirdath
and
afterward
i
bowed
a
little
to
the
man
and
made
apology
for
indeed
he
was
neither
great
nor
strongmade
and
i
had
been
better
man
to
have
shown
courtesy
to
him
at
least
in
the
first
and
so
having
done
justice
to
my
own
respect
i
turned
and
went
on
and
left
them
to
their
happiness
now
i
walked
then
maybe
twenty
good
miles
before
i
came
to
my
own
home
for
there
was
no
rest
in
me
all
that
night
or
ever
because
that
i
was
grown
deadly
in
love
of
mirdath
the
beautiful
and
all
my
spirit
and
heart
and
body
of
me
pained
with
the
dreadful
loss
that
i
was
come
so
sudden
upon
and
for
a
great
week
i
had
my
walks
in
another
direction
but
in
the
end
of
that
week
i
must
take
my
walk
along
the
olden
way
that
i
might
chance
to
have
but
a
sight
of
my
lady
and
truly
i
had
all
sight
that
ever
man
did
need
to
put
him
in
dread
pain
and
jealousy
for
truly
as
i
came
in
view
of
the
gap
there
was
the
lady
mirdath
walking
just
without
the
borders
of
the
great
wood
and
beside
her
there
walked
the
cleverdrest
man
of
the
court
and
she
suffered
his
arm
around
her
so
that
i
knew
they
were
lovers
for
the
lady
mirdath
had
no
brothers
nor
any
youthful
men
kin
yet
when
mirdath
saw
me
upon
the
road
she
shamed
in
a
moment
to
be
so
caught
for
she
put
her
lovers
arm
from
about
her
and
bowed
to
me
a
little
changed
of
colour
in
the
face
and
i
bowed
very
lowbeing
but
a
young
man
myself
and
so
passed
on
with
my
heart
very
dead
in
me
and
as
i
went
i
saw
that
her
lover
came
again
to
her
and
had
his
arm
once
more
about
her
and
so
maybe
they
looked
after
me
as
i
went
very
stiff
and
desperate
but
indeed
i
looked
not
back
on
them
as
you
may
think
and
for
a
great
month
then
i
went
not
near
to
the
gap
for
my
love
raged
in
me
and
i
was
hurt
in
my
pride
and
truly
neither
had
a
true
justice
been
dealt
to
me
by
the
lady
mirdath
yet
in
that
month
my
love
was
a
leaven
in
me
and
made
slowly
a
sweetness
and
a
tenderness
and
an
understanding
that
were
not
in
me
before
and
truly
love
and
pain
do
shape
the
character
of
man
and
in
the
end
of
that
time
i
saw
a
little
way
into
life
with
an
understanding
heart
and
began
presently
to
take
my
walks
again
past
the
gap
but
truly
mirdath
the
beautiful
was
never
to
my
sight
though
one
evening
i
thought
she
might
be
not
a
great
way
off
for
one
of
her
great
boarhounds
came
out
of
the
wood
and
down
into
the
road
to
nose
against
me
very
friendly
as
a
dog
oft
doth
with
me
yet
though
i
waited
a
good
time
after
the
dog
had
left
me
i
had
no
sight
of
mirdath
and
so
passed
on
again
with
my
heart
heavy
in
me
but
without
bitterness
because
of
the
understanding
that
was
begun
to
grow
in
my
heart
now
there
passed
two
weary
and
lonely
weeks
in
which
i
grew
sick
to
have
knowledge
of
the
beautiful
maid
and
truly
in
the
end
of
that
time
i
made
a
sudden
resolving
that
i
would
go
in
through
the
gap
and
come
to
the
homegrounds
about
the
hall
and
so
maybe
have
some
sight
of
her
and
this
resolving
i
had
one
evening
and
i
went
out
immediately
and
came
to
the
gap
and
went
in
through
the
gap
and
so
by
a
long
walking
to
the
gardens
about
the
hall
and
truly
when
i
was
come
there
i
saw
a
good
light
of
lanthorns
and
torches
and
a
great
company
of
people
dancing
and
all
drest
in
quaint
dress
so
that
i
knew
they
had
a
festival
for
some
cause
and
there
came
suddenly
a
horrid
dread
into
my
heart
that
this
might
be
the
marriagedance
of
the
lady
mirdath
but
indeed
this
was
foolishness
for
i
had
surely
heard
of
the
marriage
if
there
had
been
any
and
truly
in
a
moment
i
remembered
that
she
was
come
oneandtwenty
years
of
age
on
that
day
and
to
the
end
of
her
wardship
and
this
surely
to
be
festival
in
honour
of
the
same
and
a
very
bright
and
pretty
matter
it
was
to
watch
save
that
i
was
so
heavy
in
the
heart
with
loneliness
and
longing
for
the
company
was
great
and
gay
and
the
lights
plentiful
and
set
all
about
from
the
trees
and
in
leafmade
arbours
about
the
great
lawn
and
a
great
table
spread
with
eating
matters
and
silver
and
crystal
and
great
lamps
of
bronze
and
silver
went
all
adown
one
end
of
the
lawn
and
the
dance
constant
upon
the
other
part
and
surely
the
lady
mirdath
to
step
out
of
the
dance
very
lovely
drest
yet
seeming
to
mine
eyes
a
little
pale
in
the
looming
of
the
lights
and
she
to
wander
to
a
seat
to
rest
and
indeed
in
a
moment
there
to
be
a
dozen
youths
of
the
great
families
of
the
countryside
in
attendance
about
her
making
talk
and
laughter
and
each
eager
for
her
favour
and
she
very
lovely
in
the
midst
of
them
but
yet
as
i
did
think
lacking
of
somewhat
and
a
little
paleseeming
as
i
have
told
and
her
glance
to
go
oddwise
beyond
the
groupt
men
about
her
so
that
i
understood
in
a
moment
that
her
lover
was
not
there
and
she
to
be
alack
in
the
heart
for
him
yet
why
he
was
not
there
i
could
not
suppose
save
that
he
might
have
been
called
back
to
the
court
and
surely
as
i
watched
the
other
young
men
about
her
i
burned
with
a
fierce
and
miserable
jealousy
of
them
so
that
i
could
near
have
stept
forth
and
plucked
her
out
from
among
them
and
had
her
to
walk
with
me
in
the
woods
as
in
the
olden
days
when
she
also
had
seemed
near
to
love
but
truly
what
use
to
this
for
it
was
not
they
who
held
her
heart
as
i
saw
plain
for
i
watched
her
with
an
eager
and
lonesome
heart
and
knew
that
it
was
one
small
man
of
the
court
that
was
lover
to
her
as
i
have
told
and
i
went
away
again
then
and
came
not
near
to
the
gap
for
three
great
months
because
that
i
could
not
bear
the
pain
of
my
loss
but
in
the
end
of
that
time
my
very
pain
to
urge
me
to
go
and
to
be
worse
than
the
pain
of
not
going
so
that
i
found
myself
one
evening
in
the
gap
peering
very
eager
and
shaken
across
the
sward
that
lay
between
the
gap
and
the
woods
for
this
same
place
to
be
as
an
holy
ground
to
me
for
there
was
it
that
first
i
saw
mirdath
the
beautiful
and
surely
lost
my
heart
to
her
in
that
one
night
and
a
great
time
i
stayed
there
in
the
gap
waiting
and
watching
hopelessly
and
lo
sudden
there
came
something
against
me
touching
my
thigh
very
soft
and
when
i
looked
down
it
was
one
of
the
boarhounds
so
that
my
heart
leaped
near
frightened
for
truly
my
lady
was
come
somewhere
nigh
as
i
did
think
and
as
i
waited
very
hushed
and
watchful
yet
with
an
utter
beating
heart
surely
i
heard
a
faint
and
low
singing
among
the
trees
so
utter
sad
and
lo
it
was
mirdath
singing
a
broken
love
song
and
awander
there
in
the
dark
alone
save
for
her
great
dogs
and
i
harked
with
strange
pain
in
me
that
she
did
be
so
in
pain
and
i
ached
to
bring
her
ease
yet
moved
not
but
was
very
still
there
in
the
gap
save
that
my
being
was
all
in
turmoil
and
presently
as
i
harked
there
came
a
slim
white
figure
out
from
among
the
trees
and
the
figure
cried
out
something
and
came
to
a
quick
pause
as
i
could
see
in
the
halfdark
and
lo
in
that
moment
there
came
a
sudden
and
unreasoned
hope
into
me
and
i
came
up
out
of
the
gap
and
was
come
to
mirdath
in
a
moment
calling
very
low
and
passionate
and
eager
mirdath
mirdath
mirdath
and
this
way
i
came
to
her
and
her
great
dog
that
was
with
me
to
bound
beside
me
in
thought
mayhap
that
it
was
some
game
and
when
i
came
to
the
lady
mirdath
i
held
out
my
hands
to
her
not
knowing
what
i
did
but
only
the
telling
of
my
heart
that
needed
her
so
utter
and
craved
to
ease
her
of
her
pain
and
lo
she
put
out
her
arms
to
me
and
came
into
mine
arms
with
a
little
run
and
there
she
bode
weeping
strangely
but
yet
with
rest
upon
her
even
as
rest
was
come
sudden
and
wondrous
upon
me
and
sudden
she
moved
in
mine
arms
and
slipt
her
hands
to
me
very
dear
and
held
her
lips
up
to
me
like
some
sweet
child
that
i
kiss
her
but
indeed
she
was
also
a
true
woman
and
in
honest
and
dear
love
of
me
and
this
to
be
the
way
of
our
betrothal
and
simple
and
wordless
it
was
yet
sufficient
only
that
there
is
no
sufficiency
in
love
now
presently
she
loosed
herself
out
of
mine
arms
and
we
walked
homeward
through
the
woods
very
quiet
and
holding
hands
as
children
do
and
i
then
in
a
while
to
ask
her
about
the
man
of
the
court
and
she
laughed
very
sweet
into
the
silence
of
the
wood
but
gave
me
no
answer
save
that
i
wait
until
we
were
come
to
the
hall
and
when
we
were
come
there
she
took
me
into
the
great
hall
and
made
a
very
dainty
and
impudent
bow
mocking
me
and
so
made
me
known
to
another
lady
who
sat
there
upon
her
task
of
embroidering
which
she
did
very
demure
and
as
that
she
had
also
a
dainty
mischief
lurking
in
her
and
truly
the
lady
mirdath
never
to
be
done
of
naughty
laughter
that
made
her
dearly
breathless
with
delight
and
to
sway
a
little
and
set
the
trembling
of
pretty
sounds
in
her
throat
and
surely
she
must
pull
down
two
great
pistols
from
an
armrack
that
i
fight
a
duel
to
the
death
with
the
lady
of
the
embroidering
who
held
her
face
down
over
her
work
and
shook
likewise
with
the
wickedness
of
her
laughter
that
she
could
not
hide
and
in
the
end
the
lady
of
the
embroidering
looked
up
sudden
into
my
face
and
i
then
to
see
somewhat
of
the
mischief
in
a
moment
for
she
had
the
face
of
the
man
of
the
court
suit
that
had
been
lover
to
mirdath
and
the
lady
mirdath
then
to
explain
to
me
how
that
mistress
alison
which
was
her
name
was
a
dear
and
bosom
friend
and
she
it
was
that
had
been
drest
in
the
court
suit
to
play
a
prank
for
a
wager
with
a
certain
young
man
who
would
be
lover
to
her
an
he
might
and
i
then
to
come
along
and
so
speedy
to
offence
that
truly
i
never
saw
her
face
plain
because
that
i
was
so
utter
jealous
and
so
the
lady
mirdath
had
been
more
justly
in
anger
than
i
supposed
because
that
i
had
put
hands
upon
her
friend
as
i
have
told
and
this
to
be
all
of
it
save
that
they
had
planned
to
punish
me
and
had
met
every
evening
at
the
gap
to
play
at
lovers
perchance
i
should
pass
so
that
i
should
have
greater
cause
for
my
jealousy
and
truly
they
to
have
a
good
revenge
upon
me
for
i
had
suffered
very
great
a
long
while
because
of
it
yet
as
you
do
mind
when
i
came
upon
them
the
lady
mirdath
had
a
halfregret
that
was
very
natural
because
even
then
she
was
in
love
of
me
as
i
of
her
and
because
of
this
she
drew
away
as
you
shall
remember
beingas
she
confessedsuddenly
and
strangely
troubled
and
to
want
me
but
afterwards
as
much
set
again
to
my
punishment
because
that
i
bowed
so
cold
and
went
away
and
indeed
well
i
might
yet
truly
all
was
safe
ended
now
and
i
utter
thankful
and
with
a
mad
delight
in
the
heart
so
that
i
caught
up
mirdath
and
we
danced
very
slow
and
stately
around
the
great
hall
the
while
that
mistress
alison
whistled
us
a
tune
with
her
mouth
which
she
could
very
clever
as
many
another
thing
i
wot
and
each
day
and
all
day
after
this
gladness
mirdath
and
i
could
never
be
apart
but
must
go
awander
always
together
here
and
there
in
an
unending
joy
of
our
togetherness
and
in
a
thousand
things
were
we
at
one
in
delight
for
we
had
both
of
us
that
nature
which
doth
love
the
blue
of
eternity
which
gathers
beyond
the
wings
of
the
sunset
and
the
invisible
sound
of
the
starlight
falling
upon
the
world
and
the
quiet
of
grey
evenings
when
the
towers
of
sleep
are
builded
unto
the
mystery
of
the
dusk
and
the
solemn
green
of
strange
pastures
in
the
moonlight
and
the
speech
of
the
sycamore
unto
the
beech
and
the
slow
way
of
the
sea
when
it
doth
mood
and
the
soft
rustling
of
the
night
clouds
and
likewise
had
we
eyes
to
see
the
dancer
of
the
sunset
casting
her
mighty
robes
so
strange
and
ears
to
know
that
there
shakes
a
silent
thunder
over
the
face
of
dawn
and
much
else
that
we
knew
and
saw
and
understood
together
in
our
utter
joy
now
there
happened
to
us
about
this
time
a
certain
adventure
that
came
near
to
cause
the
death
of
mirdath
the
beautiful
for
one
day
as
we
wandered
as
ever
like
two
children
in
our
contentment
i
made
remark
to
mirdath
that
there
went
only
two
of
the
great
boarhounds
with
us
and
she
then
told
me
that
the
third
was
to
the
kennels
being
sick
yet
scarce
had
she
told
me
so
much
ere
she
cried
out
something
and
pointed
and
lo
i
saw
that
the
third
hound
came
towards
us
at
a
run
yet
very
strangeseeming
in
his
going
and
in
a
moment
mirdath
cried
out
that
the
hound
was
mad
and
truly
i
saw
then
that
the
brute
slavered
as
he
came
running
and
in
a
moment
he
was
upon
us
and
made
never
a
sound
but
leaped
at
me
in
one
instant
of
time
all
before
i
had
any
thought
of
such
intent
but
surely
my
beautiful
one
had
a
dreadful
love
for
me
for
she
cast
herself
at
the
dog
to
save
me
calling
to
the
other
hounds
and
she
was
bitten
in
a
moment
by
the
brute
as
she
strove
to
hold
him
off
from
me
but
i
to
have
him
instant
by
the
neck
and
the
body
and
brake
him
so
that
he
died
at
once
and
i
cast
him
to
the
earth
and
gave
help
to
mirdath
that
i
draw
the
poison
from
the
wounds
and
this
i
did
so
well
as
i
might
despite
that
she
would
have
me
stop
and
afterwards
i
took
her
into
mine
arms
and
ran
very
fierce
all
the
long
and
weary
way
to
the
hall
and
with
hot
skewers
i
burned
the
wounds
so
that
when
the
doctor
came
he
to
say
i
have
saved
her
by
my
care
if
indeed
she
to
be
saved
but
truly
she
had
saved
me
in
any
wise
as
you
shall
think
so
that
i
could
never
be
done
of
honour
to
her
and
she
very
pale
but
yet
to
laugh
at
my
fears
and
to
say
that
she
soon
to
have
her
health
and
the
wounds
healed
very
speedy
but
indeed
it
was
a
long
and
bitter
time
before
they
were
proper
healed
and
she
so
well
as
ever
yet
in
time
so
it
was
and
an
utter
weight
off
my
heart
and
when
mirdath
was
grown
full
strong
again
we
set
our
wedding
day
and
well
do
i
mind
how
she
stood
there
in
her
bridal
dress
on
that
day
so
slender
and
lovely
as
may
love
have
stood
in
the
dawn
of
life
and
the
beauty
of
her
eyes
that
had
such
sober
sweetness
in
them
despite
the
dear
mischief
of
her
nature
and
the
way
of
her
little
feet
and
the
loveliness
of
her
hair
and
the
dainty
roguegrace
of
her
movements
and
her
mouth
an
enticement
as
that
a
child
and
a
woman
smiled
out
of
the
one
face
and
this
to
be
no
more
than
but
an
hint
of
the
loveliness
of
my
beautiful
one
and
so
we
were
married
mirdath
my
beautiful
one
lay
dying
and
i
had
no
power
to
hold
death
backward
from
such
dread
intent
in
another
room
i
heard
the
little
wail
of
the
child
and
the
wail
of
the
child
waked
my
wife
back
into
this
life
so
that
her
hands
fluttered
white
and
desperately
needful
upon
the
coverlid
i
kneeled
beside
my
beautiful
one
and
reached
out
and
took
her
hands
very
gentle
into
mine
but
still
they
fluttered
so
needful
and
she
looked
at
me
dumbly
but
her
eyes
beseeching
then
i
went
out
of
the
room
and
called
gently
to
the
nurse
and
the
nurse
brought
in
the
child
wrapped
very
softly
in
a
long
white
robe
and
i
saw
the
eyes
of
my
beautiful
one
grow
clearer
with
a
strange
lovely
light
and
i
beckoned
to
the
nurse
to
bring
the
babe
near
my
wife
moved
her
hands
very
weakly
upon
the
coverlid
and
i
knew
that
she
craved
to
touch
her
child
and
i
signed
to
the
nurse
and
took
my
child
in
mine
arms
and
the
nurse
went
out
from
the
room
and
so
we
three
were
alone
together
then
i
sat
very
gentle
upon
the
bed
and
i
held
the
babe
near
to
my
beautiful
one
so
that
the
wee
cheek
of
the
babe
touched
the
white
cheek
of
my
dying
wife
but
the
weight
of
the
child
i
kept
off
from
her
and
presently
i
knew
that
mirdath
my
wife
strove
dumbly
to
reach
for
the
hands
of
the
babe
and
i
turned
the
child
more
towards
her
and
slipped
the
hands
of
the
child
into
the
weak
hands
of
my
beautiful
one
and
i
held
the
babe
above
my
wife
with
an
utter
care
so
that
the
eyes
of
my
dying
one
looked
into
the
young
eyes
of
the
child
and
presently
in
but
a
few
moments
of
time
though
it
had
been
someways
an
eternity
my
beautiful
one
closed
her
eyes
and
lay
very
quiet
and
i
took
away
the
child
to
the
nurse
who
stood
beyond
the
door
and
i
closed
the
door
and
came
back
to
mine
own
that
we
have
those
last
instants
alone
together
and
the
hands
of
my
wife
lay
very
still
and
white
but
presently
they
began
to
move
softly
and
weakly
searching
for
somewhat
and
i
put
out
my
great
hands
to
her
and
took
her
hands
with
an
utter
care
and
so
a
little
time
passed
then
her
eyes
opened
quiet
and
grey
and
a
little
dazed
seeming
and
she
rolled
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
saw
me
and
the
pain
of
forgetfulness
went
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
looked
at
me
with
a
look
that
grew
in
strength
unto
a
sweetness
of
tenderness
and
full
understanding
and
i
bent
a
little
to
her
and
her
eyes
told
me
to
take
her
into
mine
arms
for
those
last
minutes
then
i
went
very
gentle
upon
the
bed
and
lifted
her
with
an
utter
and
tender
care
so
that
she
lay
suddenly
strangely
restful
against
my
breast
for
love
gave
me
skill
to
hold
her
and
love
gave
my
beautiful
one
a
sweetness
of
ease
in
that
little
time
that
was
left
to
us
and
so
we
twain
were
together
and
love
seemed
that
it
had
made
a
truce
with
death
in
the
air
about
us
that
we
be
undisturbed
for
there
came
a
drowse
of
rest
even
upon
my
tense
heart
that
had
known
nothing
but
a
dreadful
pain
through
the
weary
hours
and
i
whispered
my
love
silently
to
my
beautiful
one
and
her
eyes
answered
and
the
strangely
beautiful
and
terrible
moments
passed
by
into
the
hush
of
eternity
and
suddenly
mirdath
my
beautiful
one
spokewhispering
something
and
i
stooped
gently
to
hark
and
mine
own
spoke
again
and
lo
it
was
to
call
me
by
the
olden
love
name
that
had
been
mine
through
all
the
utter
lovely
months
of
our
togetherness
and
i
began
again
to
tell
her
of
my
love
that
should
pass
beyond
death
and
lo
in
that
one
moment
of
time
the
light
went
out
of
her
eyes
and
my
beautiful
one
lay
dead
in
mine
arms

my
beautiful
one
ii
the
last
redoubt
since
mirdath
my
beautiful
one
died
and
left
me
lonely
in
this
world
i
have
suffered
an
anguish
and
an
utter
and
dreadful
pain
of
longing
such
as
truly
no
words
shall
ever
tell
for
in
truth
i
that
had
all
the
world
through
her
sweet
love
and
companionship
and
knew
all
the
joy
and
gladness
of
life
have
known
such
lonesome
misery
as
doth
stun
me
to
think
upon
yet
am
i
to
my
pen
again
for
of
late
a
wondrous
hope
has
grown
in
me
in
that
i
have
at
night
in
my
sleep
waked
into
the
future
of
this
world
and
seen
strange
things
and
utter
marvels
and
known
once
more
the
gladness
of
life
for
i
have
learned
the
promise
of
the
future
and
have
visited
in
my
dreams
those
places
where
in
the
womb
of
time
she
and
i
shall
come
together
and
part
and
again
come
togetherbreaking
asunder
most
drearly
in
pain
and
again
reuniting
after
strange
ages
in
a
glad
and
mighty
wonder
and
this
is
the
utter
strange
story
of
that
which
i
have
seen
and
which
truly
i
must
set
out
if
the
task
be
not
too
great
so
that
in
the
setting
out
thereof
i
may
gain
a
little
ease
of
the
heart
and
likewise
mayhap
give
ease
of
hope
to
some
other
poor
human
that
doth
suffer
even
as
i
have
suffered
so
dreadful
with
longing
for
mine
own
that
is
dead
and
some
shall
read
and
say
that
this
thing
was
not
and
some
shall
dispute
with
them
but
to
them
all
i
say
naught
save
read
and
having
read
that
which
i
set
down
then
shall
one
and
all
have
looked
towards
eternity
with
meunto
its
very
portals
and
so
to
my
telling
to
me
in
this
last
time
of
my
visions
of
which
i
would
tell
it
was
not
as
if
i
dreamed
but
as
it
were
that
i
waked
there
into
the
dark
in
the
future
of
this
world
and
the
sun
had
died
and
for
me
thus
newly
waked
into
that
future
to
look
back
upon
this
our
present
age
was
to
look
back
into
dreams
that
my
soul
knew
to
be
of
reality
but
which
to
those
newlyseeing
eyes
of
mine
appeared
but
as
a
far
vision
strangely
hallowed
with
peacefulness
and
light
always
it
seemed
to
me
when
i
awaked
into
the
future
into
the
everlasting
night
that
lapped
this
world
that
i
saw
near
to
me
and
girdling
me
all
about
a
blurred
greyness
and
presently
this
the
greyness
would
clear
and
fade
from
about
me
even
as
a
dusky
cloud
and
i
would
look
out
upon
a
world
of
darkness
lit
here
and
there
with
strange
sights
and
with
my
waking
into
that
future
i
waked
not
to
ignorance
but
to
a
full
knowledge
of
those
things
which
lit
the
night
land
even
as
a
man
wakes
from
sleep
each
morning
and
knows
immediately
he
wakes
the
names
and
knowledge
of
the
time
which
has
bred
him
and
in
which
he
lives
and
the
same
while
a
knowledge
i
had
as
it
were
subconscious
of
this
presentthis
early
life
which
now
i
live
so
utterly
alone
in
my
earliest
knowledge
of
that
place
i
was
a
youth
seventeen
years
grown
and
my
memory
tells
me
that
when
first
i
waked
or
came
as
it
might
be
said
to
myself
in
that
future
i
stood
in
one
of
the
embrasures
of
the
last
redoubtthat
great
pyramid
of
grey
metal
which
held
the
last
millions
of
this
world
from
the
powers
of
the
slayers
and
so
full
am
i
of
the
knowledge
of
that
place
that
scarce
can
i
believe
that
none
here
know
and
because
i
have
such
difficulty
it
may
be
that
i
speak
over
familiarly
of
those
things
of
which
i
know
and
heed
not
to
explain
much
that
it
is
needful
that
i
should
explain
to
those
who
must
read
here
in
this
our
present
day
for
there
as
i
stood
and
looked
out
i
was
less
the
man
of
years
of
this
age
than
the
youth
of
that
with
the
natural
knowledge
of
that
life
which
i
had
gathered
by
living
all
my
seventeen
years
of
life
there
though
until
that
my
first
vision
i
of
this
age
knew
not
of
that
other
and
future
existence
yet
woke
to
it
so
naturally
as
may
a
man
wake
here
in
his
bed
to
the
shining
of
the
morning
sun
and
know
it
by
name
and
the
meaning
of
aught
else
and
yet
as
i
stood
there
in
the
vast
embrasure
i
had
also
a
knowledge
or
memory
of
this
present
life
of
ours
deep
down
within
me
but
touched
with
a
halo
of
dreams
and
yet
with
a
conscious
longing
for
one
known
even
there
in
a
half
memory
as
mirdath
as
i
have
said
in
my
earliest
memory
i
mind
that
i
stood
in
an
embrasure
high
up
in
the
side
of
the
pyramid
and
looked
outwards
through
a
queer
spyglass
to
the
northwest
aye
full
of
youth
and
with
an
adventurous
and
yet
halffearful
heart
and
in
my
brain
was
as
i
have
told
the
knowledge
that
had
come
to
me
in
all
the
years
of
my
life
in
the
redoubt
and
yet
until
that
moment
this
man
of
this
present
time
had
no
knowledge
of
that
future
existence
and
now
i
stood
and
had
suddenly
the
knowledge
of
a
life
already
spent
in
that
strange
land
and
deeper
within
me
the
misty
knowings
of
this
our
present
age
and
maybe
also
of
some
others
to
the
northwest
i
looked
through
the
queer
spyglass
and
saw
a
landscape
that
i
had
looked
upon
and
pored
upon
through
all
the
years
of
that
life
so
that
i
knew
how
to
name
this
thing
and
that
thing
and
give
the
very
distances
of
each
and
every
one
from
the
centrepoint
of
the
pyramid
which
was
that
which
had
neither
length
nor
breadth
and
was
made
of
polished
metal
in
the
room
of
mathematics
where
i
went
daily
to
my
studies
to
the
northwest
i
looked
and
in
the
wide
field
of
my
glass
saw
plain
the
bright
glare
of
the
fire
from
the
red
pit
shine
upwards
against
the
underside
of
the
vast
chin
of
the
northwest
watcherthe
watching
thing
of
the
northwest
that
which
hath
watched
from
the
beginning
and
until
the
opening
of
the
gateway
of
eternity
came
into
my
thoughts
as
i
looked
through
the
glass

the
words
of
aesworpth
the
ancient
poet
though
incredibly
future
to
this
our
time
and
suddenly
they
seemed
at
fault
for
i
looked
deep
down
into
my
being
and
saw
as
dreams
are
seen
the
sunlight
and
splendour
of
this
our
present
age
and
i
was
amazed
and
here
i
must
make
it
clear
to
all
that
even
as
i
waked
from
this
age
suddenly
into
that
life
so
must
ithat
youth
there
in
the
embrasurehave
awakened
then
to
the
knowledge
of
this
farback
life
of
oursseeming
to
him
a
vision
of
the
very
beginnings
of
eternity
in
the
dawn
of
the
world
oh
i
do
but
dread
i
make
it
not
sufficient
clear
that
i
and
he
were
both
ithe
same
soul
he
of
that
far
date
seeing
vaguely
the
life
that
was
that
i
do
now
live
in
this
present
age
and
i
of
this
time
beholding
the
life
that
i
yet
shall
live
how
utterly
strange
and
yet
i
do
not
know
that
i
speak
holy
truth
to
say
that
i
in
that
future
time
had
no
knowledge
of
this
life
and
age
before
that
awakening
for
i
woke
to
find
that
i
was
one
who
stood
apart
from
the
other
youths
in
that
i
had
a
dim
knowledgevisionary
as
it
were
of
the
past
which
confounded
whilst
yet
it
angered
those
who
were
the
men
of
learning
of
that
age
though
of
this
matter
more
anon
but
this
i
do
know
that
from
that
time
onwards
my
knowledge
and
assuredness
of
the
past
was
tenfold
for
this
my
memory
of
that
life
told
me
and
so
to
further
my
telling
yet
before
i
pass
onwards
one
other
thing
is
there
of
which
i
shall
speakin
the
moment
in
which
i
waked
out
of
that
youthfulness
into
the
assured
awaredness
of
this
our
age
in
that
moment
the
hunger
of
this
my
love
flew
to
me
across
the
ages
so
that
what
had
been
but
a
memorydream
grew
to
the
pain
of
reality
and
i
knew
suddenly
that
i
lacked
and
from
that
time
onwards
i
went
listening
as
even
now
my
life
is
spent
and
so
it
was
that
i
freshborn
in
that
future
time
hungered
strangely
for
my
beautiful
one
with
all
the
strength
of
that
new
life
knowing
that
she
had
been
mine
and
might
live
again
even
as
i
and
so
as
i
have
said
i
hungered
and
found
that
i
listened
and
now
to
go
back
from
my
digression
it
was
as
i
have
said
i
had
amazement
at
perceiving
in
memory
the
unknowable
sunshine
and
splendour
of
this
age
breaking
so
clear
through
my
hitherto
most
vague
and
hazy
visions
so
that
the
ignorance
of
aesworpth
was
shouted
to
me
by
the
things
which
now
i
knew
and
from
that
time
onward
for
a
little
space
i
was
stunned
with
all
that
i
knew
and
guessed
and
felt
and
all
of
a
long
while
the
hunger
grew
for
that
one
i
had
lost
in
the
early
daysshe
who
had
sung
to
me
in
those
faery
days
of
light
that
had
been
in
verity
and
the
especial
thoughts
of
that
age
looked
back
with
a
keen
regretful
wonder
into
the
gulf
of
forgetfulness
but
presently
i
turned
from
the
haze
and
pain
of
my
dreammemories
once
more
to
the
inconceivable
mystery
of
the
night
land
which
i
viewed
through
the
great
embrasure
for
on
none
did
it
ever
come
with
weariness
to
look
out
upon
all
the
hideous
mysteries
so
that
old
and
young
watched
from
early
years
to
death
the
black
monstrosity
of
the
night
land
which
this
our
last
refuge
of
humanity
held
at
bay
to
the
right
of
the
red
pit
there
lay
a
long
sinuous
glare
which
i
knew
as
the
vale
of
red
fire
and
beyond
that
for
many
dreary
miles
the
blackness
of
the
night
land
across
which
came
the
coldness
of
the
light
from
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
then
on
the
very
borders
of
the
unknown
lands
there
lay
a
range
of
low
volcanoes
which
lit
up
far
away
in
the
outer
darkness
the
black
hills
where
shone
the
seven
lights
which
neither
twinkled
nor
moved
nor
faltered
through
eternity
and
of
which
even
the
great
spyglass
could
make
no
understanding
nor
had
any
adventurer
from
the
pyramid
ever
come
back
to
tell
us
aught
of
them
and
here
let
me
say
that
down
in
the
great
library
of
the
redoubt
were
the
histories
of
all
those
with
their
discoveries
who
had
ventured
out
into
the
monstrousness
of
the
night
land
risking
not
the
life
only
but
the
spirit
of
life
and
surely
it
is
all
so
strange
and
wonderful
to
set
out
that
i
could
almost
despair
with
the
contemplation
of
that
which
i
must
achieve
for
there
is
so
much
to
tell
and
so
few
words
given
to
man
by
which
he
may
make
clear
that
which
lies
beyond
the
sight
and
the
present
and
general
knowings
of
peoples
how
shall
you
ever
know
as
i
know
in
verity
of
the
greatness
and
reality
and
terror
of
the
thing
that
i
would
tell
plain
to
all
for
we
with
our
puny
span
of
recorded
life
must
have
great
histories
to
tell
but
the
few
bare
details
we
know
concerning
years
that
are
but
a
few
thousands
in
all
and
i
must
set
out
to
you
in
the
short
pages
of
this
my
life
there
a
sufficiency
of
the
life
that
had
been
and
the
life
that
was
both
within
and
without
that
mighty
pyramid
to
make
clear
to
those
who
may
read
the
truth
of
that
which
i
would
tell
and
the
histories
of
that
great
redoubt
dealt
not
with
odd
thousands
of
years
but
with
very
millions
aye
away
back
into
what
they
of
that
age
conceived
to
be
the
early
days
of
the
earth
when
the
sun
maybe
still
gloomed
dully
in
the
night
sky
of
the
world
but
of
all
that
went
before
nothing
save
as
myths
and
matters
to
be
taken
most
cautiously
and
believed
not
by
men
of
sanity
and
proved
wisdom
and
i
how
shall
i
make
all
this
clear
to
you
who
may
read
the
thing
cannot
be
and
yet
i
must
tell
my
history
for
to
be
silent
before
so
much
wonder
would
be
to
suffer
of
too
full
a
heart
and
i
must
even
ease
my
spirit
by
this
my
struggle
to
tell
to
all
how
it
was
with
me
and
how
it
will
be
aye
even
to
the
memories
which
were
the
possession
of
that
far
future
youth
who
was
indeed
i
of
his
childhoods
days
when
his
nurse
of
that
age
swung
him
and
crooned
impossible
lullabies
of
this
mythical
sun
which
according
to
those
future
fairytales
had
once
passed
across
the
blackness
that
now
lay
above
the
pyramid
such
is
the
monstrous
futureness
of
this
which
i
have
seen
through
the
body
of
that
faroff
youth
and
so
back
to
my
telling
to
my
right
which
was
to
the
north
there
stood
very
far
away
the
house
of
silence
upon
a
low
hill
and
in
that
house
were
many
lights
and
no
sound
and
so
had
it
been
through
an
uncountable
eternity
of
years
always
those
steady
lights
and
no
whisper
of
soundnot
even
such
as
our
distancemicrophones
could
have
discovered
and
the
danger
of
this
house
was
accounted
the
greatest
danger
of
all
those
lands
and
round
by
the
house
of
silence
wound
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
and
concerning
this
road
which
passed
out
of
the
unknown
lands
nigh
by
the
place
of
the
abhumans
where
was
always
the
green
luminous
mist
nothing
was
known
save
that
it
was
held
that
of
all
the
works
about
the
mighty
pyramid
it
was
alone
the
one
that
was
bred
long
ages
past
of
healthy
human
toil
and
labour
and
on
this
point
alone
had
a
thousand
books
and
more
been
writ
and
all
contrary
and
so
to
no
end
as
is
ever
the
way
in
such
matters
and
as
it
was
with
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
so
it
was
with
all
those
other
monstrous
things

whole
libraries
had
there
been
made
upon
this
and
upon
that
and
many
a
thousand
million
mouldered
into
the
forgotten
dust
of
the
earlier
world
i
mind
me
now
that
presently
i
stepped
upon
the
central
travellingroadway
which
spanned
the
one
thousandth
plateau
of
the
great
redoubt
and
this
lay
six
miles
and
thirty
fathoms
above
the
plain
of
the
night
land
and
was
somewhat
of
a
great
mile
or
more
across
and
so
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
at
the
southeastern
wall
and
looking
out
through
the
great
embrasure
towards
the
three
silverfire
holes
that
shone
before
the
thing
that
nods
away
down
far
in
the
southeast
southward
of
this
but
nearer
there
rose
the
vast
bulk
of
the
southeast
watcherthe
watching
thing
of
the
southeast
and
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
of
the
squat
monster
burned
the
torches
maybe
halfamile
upon
each
side
yet
sufficient
light
they
threw
to
show
the
lumberedforward
head
of
the
neversleeping
brute
to
the
east
as
i
stood
there
in
the
quietness
of
the
sleepingtime
on
the
one
thousandth
plateau
i
heard
a
far
dreadful
sound
down
in
the
lightless
east
and
presently
againa
strange
dreadful
laughter
deep
as
a
low
thunder
among
the
mountains
and
because
this
sound
came
odd
whiles
from
the
unknown
lands
beyond
the
valley
of
the
hounds
we
had
named
that
far
and
neverseen
place
the
country
whence
comes
the
great
laughter
and
though
i
had
heard
the
sound
many
and
oft
a
time
yet
did
i
never
hear
it
without
a
most
strange
thrilling
of
my
heart
and
a
sense
of
my
littleness
and
of
the
utter
terror
which
had
beset
the
last
millions
of
the
world
yet
because
i
had
heard
the
laughter
oft
i
paid
not
overlong
attention
to
my
thoughts
upon
it
and
when
in
a
little
it
died
away
into
that
eastern
darkness
i
turned
my
spyglass
upon
the
giants
pit
which
lay
to
the
south
of
the
giants
kilns
and
these
same
kilns
were
tended
by
the
giants
and
the
light
of
the
kilns
was
red
and
fitful
and
threw
wavering
shadows
and
lights
across
the
mouth
of
the
pit
so
that
i
saw
giants
crawling
up
out
of
the
pit
but
not
properly
seen
by
reason
of
the
dance
of
the
shadows
and
so
because
ever
there
was
so
much
to
behold
i
looked
away
presently
to
that
which
was
plainer
to
be
examined
to
the
back
of
the
giants
pit
was
a
great
black
headland
that
stood
vast
between
the
valley
of
the
hounds
where
lived
the
monstrous
night
hounds
and
the
giants
and
the
light
of
the
kilns
struck
the
brow
of
this
black
headland
so
that
constantly
i
saw
things
peer
over
the
edge
coming
forward
a
little
into
the
light
of
the
kilns
and
drawing
back
swiftly
into
the
shadows
and
thus
it
had
been
ever
through
the
uncounted
ages
so
that
the
headland
was
known
as
the
headland
from
which
strange
things
peer
and
thus
was
it
marked
in
our
maps
and
charts
of
that
grim
world
and
so
i
could
go
on
ever
but
that
i
fear
to
weary
and
yet
whether
i
do
weary
or
not
i
must
tell
of
this
country
that
i
see
even
now
as
i
set
my
thoughts
down
so
plainly
that
my
memory
wanders
in
a
hushed
and
secret
fashion
along
its
starkness
and
amid
its
strange
and
dread
habitants
so
that
it
is
but
by
an
effort
i
realise
me
that
my
body
is
not
there
in
this
very
moment
that
i
write
and
so
to
further
tellings
before
me
ran
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
and
i
searched
it
as
many
a
time
in
my
earlier
youth
had
i
with
the
spyglass
for
my
heart
was
always
stirred
mightily
by
the
sight
of
those
silent
ones
and
presently
alone
in
all
the
miles
of
that
nightgrey
road
i
saw
one
in
the
field
of
my
glassa
quiet
cloaked
figure
moving
along
shrouded
and
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
and
thus
was
it
with
these
beings
ever
it
was
told
about
in
the
redoubt
that
they
would
harm
no
human
if
but
the
human
did
keep
a
fair
distance
from
them
but
that
it
were
wise
never
to
come
close
upon
one
and
this
i
can
well
believe
and
so
searching
the
road
with
my
gaze
i
passed
beyond
this
silent
one
and
past
the
place
where
the
road
sweeping
vastly
to
the
southeast
was
lit
a
space
strangely
by
the
light
from
the
silverfire
holes
and
thus
at
last
to
where
it
swayed
to
the
south
of
the
dark
palace
and
thence
southward
still
until
it
passed
round
to
the
westward
beyond
the
mountain
bulk
of
the
watching
thing
in
the
souththe
hugest
monster
in
all
the
visible
night
lands
my
spyglass
showed
it
to
me
with
clearnessa
living
hill
of
watchfulness
known
to
us
as
the
watcher
of
the
south
it
brooded
there
squat
and
tremendous
hunched
over
the
pale
radiance
of
the
glowing
dome
much
i
know
had
been
writ
concerning
this
odd
vast
watcher
for
it
had
grown
out
of
the
blackness
of
the
south
unknown
lands
a
million
years
gone
and
the
steady
growing
nearness
of
it
had
been
noted
and
set
out
at
length
by
the
men
they
called
monstruwacans
so
that
it
was
possible
to
search
in
our
libraries
and
learn
of
the
very
coming
of
this
beast
in
the
oldentime
and
while
i
mind
me
there
were
even
then
and
always
men
named
monstruwacans
whose
duty
it
was
to
take
heed
of
the
great
forces
and
to
watch
the
monsters
and
the
beasts
that
beset
the
great
pyramid
and
measure
and
record
and
have
so
full
a
knowledge
of
these
same
that
did
one
but
sway
an
head
in
the
darkness
the
same
matter
was
set
down
with
particularness
in
the
records
and
so
to
tell
more
about
the
south
watcher
a
million
years
gone
as
i
have
told
came
it
out
from
the
blackness
of
the
south
and
grew
steadily
nearer
through
twenty
thousand
years
but
so
slow
that
in
no
one
year
could
a
man
perceive
that
it
had
moved
yet
it
had
movement
and
had
come
thus
far
upon
its
road
to
the
redoubt
when
the
glowing
dome
rose
out
of
the
ground
before
itgrowing
slowly
and
this
had
stayed
the
way
of
the
monster
so
that
through
an
eternity
it
had
looked
towards
the
pyramid
across
the
pale
glare
of
the
dome
and
seeming
to
have
no
power
to
advance
nearer
and
because
of
this
much
had
been
writ
to
prove
that
there
were
other
forces
than
evil
at
work
in
the
night
lands
about
the
last
redoubt
and
this
i
have
always
thought
to
be
wisely
said
and
indeed
there
to
be
no
doubt
to
the
matter
for
there
were
many
things
in
the
time
of
which
i
have
knowledge
which
seemed
to
make
clear
that
even
as
the
forces
of
darkness
were
loose
upon
the
end
of
man
so
were
there
other
forces
out
to
do
battle
with
the
terror
though
in
ways
most
strange
and
unthought
of
by
the
human
mind
and
of
this
i
shall
have
more
to
tell
anon
and
here
before
i
go
further
with
my
telling
let
me
set
out
some
of
that
knowledge
which
yet
remains
so
clear
within
my
mind
and
heart
of
the
coming
of
these
monstrosities
and
evil
forces
no
man
could
say
much
with
verity
for
the
evil
of
it
began
before
the
histories
of
the
great
redoubt
were
shaped
aye
even
before
the
sun
had
lost
all
power
to
light
though
it
must
not
be
a
thing
of
certainty
that
even
at
this
far
time
the
invisible
black
heavens
held
no
warmth
for
this
world
but
of
this
i
have
no
room
to
tell
and
must
pass
on
to
that
of
which
i
have
a
more
certain
knowledge
the
evil
must
surely
have
begun
in
the
days
of
the
darkening
which
i
might
liken
to
a
story
which
was
believed
doubtfully
much
as
we
of
this
day
believe
the
story
of
the
creation
a
dim
record
there
was
of
olden
sciences
that
are
yet
far
off
in
our
future
which
disturbing
the
unmeasurable
outward
powers
had
allowed
to
pass
the
barrier
of
life
some
of
those
monsters
and
abhuman
creatures
which
are
so
wondrously
cushioned
from
us
at
this
normal
present
and
thus
there
had
materialized
and
in
other
cases
developed
grotesque
and
horrible
creatures
which
now
beset
the
humans
of
this
world
and
where
there
was
no
power
to
take
on
material
form
there
had
been
allowed
to
certain
dreadful
forces
to
have
power
to
affect
the
life
of
the
human
spirit
and
this
growing
very
dreadful
and
the
world
full
of
lawlessness
and
degeneracy
there
had
banded
together
the
sound
millions
and
built
the
last
redoubt
there
in
the
twilight
of
the
worldso
it
seems
to
us
and
yet
to
them
bred
at
last
to
the
peace
of
usage
as
it
were
the
beginning
and
this
i
can
make
no
clearer
and
none
hath
right
to
expect
it
for
my
task
is
very
great
and
beyond
the
power
of
human
skill
and
when
the
humans
had
built
the
great
pyramid
it
had
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
twenty
floors
and
the
thickness
of
each
floor
was
according
to
the
strength
of
its
need
and
the
whole
height
of
this
pyramid
exceeded
seven
miles
by
near
a
mile
and
above
it
was
a
tower
from
which
the
watchmen
looked
these
being
called
the
monstruwacans
but
where
the
redoubt
was
built
i
know
not
save
that
i
believe
in
a
mighty
valley
of
which
i
may
tell
more
in
due
time
and
when
the
pyramid
was
built
the
last
millions
who
were
the
builders
thereof
went
within
and
made
themselves
a
great
house
and
city
of
this
last
redoubt
and
thus
began
the
second
history
of
this
world
and
how
shall
i
set
it
all
down
in
these
little
pages
for
my
task
even
as
i
see
it
is
too
great
for
the
power
of
a
single
life
and
a
single
pen
yet
to
it
and
later
through
hundreds
and
thousands
of
years
there
grew
up
in
the
outer
lands
beyond
those
which
lay
under
the
guard
of
the
redoubt
mighty
and
lost
races
of
terrible
creatures
half
men
and
half
beast
and
evil
and
dreadful
and
these
made
war
upon
the
redoubt
but
were
beaten
off
from
that
grim
metal
mountain
with
a
vast
slaughter
yet
must
there
have
been
many
such
attacks
until
the
electric
circle
was
put
about
the
pyramid
and
lit
from
the
earthcurrent
and
the
lowest
halfmile
of
the
pyramid
was
sealed
and
so
at
last
there
was
a
peace
and
the
beginnings
of
that
eternity
of
quiet
watching
for
the
day
when
the
earthcurrent
shall
become
exhausted
and
at
whiles
through
the
forgotten
centuries
had
the
creatures
been
glutted
time
and
again
upon
such
odd
bands
of
daring
ones
as
had
adventured
forth
to
explore
through
the
mystery
of
the
night
lands
for
of
those
who
went
scarce
any
did
ever
return
for
there
were
eyes
in
all
that
dark
and
powers
and
forces
abroad
which
had
all
knowledge
or
so
we
must
fain
believe
and
then
so
it
would
seem
as
that
eternal
night
lengthened
itself
upon
the
world
the
power
of
terror
grew
and
strengthened
and
fresh
and
greater
monsters
developed
and
bred
out
of
all
space
and
outward
dimensions
attracted
even
as
it
might
be
infernal
sharks
by
that
lonely
and
mighty
hill
of
humanity
facing
its
endso
near
to
the
eternal
and
yet
so
far
deferred
in
the
minds
and
to
the
senses
of
those
humans
and
thus
hath
it
been
ever
and
all
this
but
by
the
way
and
vague
and
ill
told
and
set
out
in
despair
to
make
a
little
clear
the
beginnings
of
that
state
which
is
so
strange
to
our
conceptions
and
yet
which
had
become
a
condition
of
naturalness
to
humanity
in
that
stupendous
future
thus
had
the
giants
come
fathered
of
bestial
humans
and
mothered
of
monsters
and
many
and
diverse
were
the
creatures
which
had
some
human
semblance
and
intelligence
mechanical
and
cunning
so
that
certain
of
these
lesser
brutes
had
machinery
and
underground
ways
having
need
to
secure
to
themselves
warmth
and
air
even
as
healthy
humans
only
that
they
were
incredibly
inured
to
hardship
as
they
might
be
wolves
set
in
comparison
with
tender
children
and
surely
do
i
make
this
thing
clear
and
now
to
continue
my
telling
concerning
the
night
land
the
watcher
of
the
south
was
as
i
have
set
to
make
known
a
monster
differing
from
those
other
watching
things
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
of
which
there
were
in
all
four
one
to
the
northwest
and
one
to
the
southeast
and
of
these
i
have
told
and
the
other
twain
lay
brooding
one
to
the
southwest
and
the
other
to
the
northeast
and
thus
the
four
watchers
kept
ward
through
the
darkness
upon
the
pyramid
and
moved
not
neither
gave
they
out
any
sound
yet
did
we
know
them
to
be
mountains
of
living
watchfulness
and
hideous
and
steadfast
intelligence
and
so
in
a
while
having
listened
to
the
sorrowful
sound
which
came
ever
to
us
over
the
grey
dunes
from
the
country
of
wailing
which
lay
to
the
south
midway
between
the
redoubt
and
the
watcher
of
the
south
i
passed
upon
one
of
the
moving
roadways
over
to
the
southwestern
side
of
the
pyramid
and
looked
from
a
narrow
embrasure
thence
far
down
into
the
deep
valley
which
was
four
miles
deep
and
in
which
was
the
pit
of
the
red
smoke
and
the
mouth
of
this
pit
was
one
full
mile
across
and
the
smoke
of
the
pit
filled
the
valley
at
times
so
that
it
seemed
but
as
a
glowing
red
circle
amid
dull
thunderous
clouds
of
redness
yet
the
red
smoke
rose
never
much
above
the
valley
so
that
there
was
clear
sight
across
to
the
country
beyond
and
there
along
the
further
edge
of
that
great
depth
were
the
towers
each
maybe
a
mile
high
grey
and
quiet
but
with
a
shimmer
upon
them
beyond
these
south
and
west
of
them
was
the
enormous
bulk
of
the
southwest
watcher
and
from
the
ground
rose
what
we
named
the
eye
beama
single
ray
of
grey
light
which
came
up
out
of
the
ground
and
lit
the
right
eye
of
the
monster
and
because
of
this
light
that
eye
had
been
mightily
examined
through
unknown
thousands
of
years
and
some
held
that
the
eye
looked
through
the
light
steadfastly
at
the
pyramid
but
others
set
out
that
the
light
blinded
it
and
was
the
work
of
those
other
powers
which
were
abroad
to
do
combat
with
the
evil
forces
but
however
this
may
be
as
i
stood
there
in
the
embrasure
and
looked
at
the
thing
through
the
spyglass
it
seemed
to
my
soul
that
the
brute
looked
straightly
at
me
unwinking
and
steadfast
and
fully
of
a
knowledge
that
i
spied
upon
it
and
this
is
how
i
felt
to
the
north
of
this
in
the
direction
of
the
west
i
saw
the
place
where
the
silent
ones
kill
and
this
was
so
named
because
there
maybe
ten
thousand
years
gone
certain
humans
adventuring
from
the
pyramid
came
off
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
and
into
that
place
and
were
immediately
destroyed
and
this
was
told
by
one
who
escaped
though
he
died
also
very
quickly
for
his
heart
was
frozen
and
this
i
cannot
explain
but
so
it
was
set
out
in
the
records
far
away
beyond
the
place
where
the
silent
ones
kill
in
the
very
mouth
of
the
western
night
was
the
place
of
the
abhumans
where
was
lost
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
in
a
dull
green
luminous
mist
and
of
this
place
nothing
was
known
though
much
it
held
the
thoughts
and
attentions
of
our
thinkers
and
imaginers
for
some
said
that
there
was
a
place
of
safety
differing
from
the
redoubt
as
we
of
this
day
suppose
heaven
to
differ
from
the
earth
and
that
the
road
led
thence
but
was
barred
by
the
abhumans
and
this
i
can
only
set
down
here
but
with
no
thought
to
justify
or
uphold
it
later
i
travelled
over
to
the
northeastern
wall
of
the
redoubt
and
looked
thence
with
my
spyglass
at
the
watcher
of
the
northeastthe
crowned
watcher
it
was
called
in
that
within
the
air
above
its
vast
head
there
hung
always
a
blue
luminous
ring
which
shed
a
strange
light
downwards
over
the
monstershowing
a
vast
wrinkled
brow
upon
which
an
whole
library
had
been
writ
but
putting
to
the
shadow
all
the
lower
face
all
save
the
ear
which
came
out
from
the
back
of
the
head
and
belled
towards
the
redoubt
and
had
been
said
by
some
observers
in
the
past
to
have
been
seen
to
quiver
but
how
that
might
be
i
knew
not
for
no
man
of
our
days
had
seen
such
a
thing
and
beyond
the
watching
thing
was
the
place
where
the
silent
ones
are
never
close
by
the
great
road
which
was
bounded
upon
the
far
side
by
the
giants
sea
and
upon
the
far
side
of
that
was
a
road
which
was
always
named
the
road
by
the
quiet
city
for
it
passed
along
that
place
where
burned
forever
the
constant
and
nevermoving
lights
of
a
strange
city
but
no
glass
had
ever
shown
life
there
neither
had
any
light
ever
ceased
to
burn
and
beyond
that
again
was
the
black
mist
and
here
let
me
say
that
the
valley
of
the
hounds
ended
towards
the
lights
of
the
quiet
city
and
so
have
i
set
out
something
of
that
land
and
of
those
creatures
and
circumstances
which
beset
us
about
waiting
until
the
day
of
doom
when
our
earthcurrent
should
cease
and
leave
us
helpless
to
the
watchers
and
the
abundant
terror
and
there
i
stood
and
looked
forth
composedly
as
may
one
who
has
been
born
to
know
of
such
matters
and
reared
in
the
knowledge
of
them
and
anon
i
would
look
upward
and
see
the
grey
metalled
mountain
going
up
measureless
into
the
gloom
of
the
everlasting
night
and
from
my
feet
the
sheer
downward
sweep
of
the
grim
metal
walls
six
full
miles
and
more
to
the
plain
below
and
one
thing
aye
and
i
fear
me
many
have
i
missed
to
set
out
with
particularness
there
was
as
you
do
know
all
around
the
base
of
the
pyramid
which
was
five
and
onequarter
miles
every
way
a
great
circle
of
light
which
was
set
up
by
the
earthcurrent
and
burned
within
a
transparent
tube
or
had
that
appearance
and
it
bounded
the
pyramid
for
a
clear
mile
upon
every
side
and
burned
for
ever
and
none
of
the
monsters
had
power
ever
to
pass
across
because
of
what
we
did
call
the
air
clog
that
it
did
make
as
an
invisible
wall
of
safety
and
it
did
give
out
also
a
more
subtile
vibration
that
did
affect
the
weak
brainelements
of
the
monsters
and
the
lower
menbrutes
and
some
did
hold
that
there
went
from
it
a
further
vibration
of
a
greater
subtileness
that
gave
a
protecting
against
the
evil
forces
and
some
quality
it
had
truly
thiswise
for
the
evil
powers
had
no
ability
to
cause
harm
to
any
within
yet
were
there
some
dangers
against
which
it
might
not
avail
but
these
had
no
cunning
to
bring
harm
to
any
within
the
great
redoubt
who
had
wisdom
to
meddle
with
no
dreadfulness
and
so
were
those
last
millions
guarded
until
the
earthcurrent
should
be
used
to
its
end
and
this
circle
is
that
which
i
have
called
the
electric
circle
though
with
failure
to
explain
but
there
it
was
called
only
the
circle
and
thus
have
i
with
great
effort
made
a
little
clear
that
grim
land
of
night
where
presently
my
listening
heard
one
calling
across
the
dark
and
how
that
this
grew
upon
me
i
will
set
out
forthwith
iii
the
quiet
calling
now
oft
had
i
heard
tell
not
only
in
that
great
city
which
occupied
the
thousandth
floor
but
in
others
of
the
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
twenty
cities
of
the
pyramid
that
there
was
somewhere
out
in
the
desolation
of
the
night
lands
a
second
place
of
refuge
where
had
gathered
in
another
part
of
this
dead
world
some
last
millions
of
the
human
race
to
fight
unto
the
end
and
this
story
i
heard
everywhere
in
my
travels
through
the
cities
of
the
great
redoubt
which
travels
began
when
i
came
upon
my
seventeenth
year
and
continued
for
three
years
and
two
hundred
and
twenty
five
days
being
even
then
but
one
day
in
each
city
as
was
the
custom
in
the
training
of
every
child
and
truly
it
was
a
great
journey
and
in
it
i
met
with
many
whom
to
know
was
to
love
but
whom
never
could
i
see
again
for
life
has
not
space
enough
and
each
must
to
his
duty
to
the
security
and
wellbeing
of
the
redoubt
yet
for
all
that
i
have
set
down
we
travelled
much
always
but
there
were
so
many
millions
and
so
few
years
and
as
i
have
said
everywhere
i
went
there
was
the
same
story
of
this
other
place
of
refuge
and
in
such
of
the
libraries
of
those
cities
as
i
had
time
to
search
there
were
great
numbers
of
works
upon
the
existence
of
this
other
refuge
and
some
far
back
in
the
years
made
assertion
with
confidence
that
such
a
place
was
in
verity
and
indeed
no
doubt
did
there
seem
in
those
bygone
ages
but
now
these
very
records
were
read
only
by
scholars
who
doubted
even
whilst
they
read
and
so
is
it
ever
but
of
the
reality
of
this
refuge
i
had
never
a
sound
doubt
from
the
day
of
my
hearing
concerning
it
from
our
master
monstruwacan
who
with
all
his
assistants
occupied
the
tower
of
observation
in
the
apex
of
the
pyramid
and
here
let
me
tell
that
he
and
i
had
always
an
affinity
and
close
friendship
one
for
the
other
though
he
was
full
grown
and
i
but
a
youth
yet
so
it
was
and
thus
when
i
had
come
to
an
age
of
twentyone
years
of
life
he
opened
to
me
a
post
within
the
tower
of
observation
and
this
was
a
most
wondrous
good
fortune
to
me
for
in
all
the
vast
redoubt
to
be
appointed
to
the
tower
of
observation
was
the
most
desired
for
thereby
even
as
in
these
days
doth
astronomy
was
the
natural
curiosity
of
man
eased
somewhat
even
while
thwarted
now
let
me
tell
here
also
lest
it
be
thought
that
i
was
unduly
favoured
because
of
my
friendship
with
the
master
monstruwacan
that
there
was
a
sound
justification
for
his
choice
in
that
to
me
had
been
given
that
strange
gift
of
hearing
which
we
called
nighthearing
though
this
was
but
a
fanciful
name
and
meant
little
yet
the
peculiar
gift
was
rare
and
in
all
the
millions
of
the
pyramid
there
was
none
with
the
gift
to
a
great
degree
saving
only
myself
and
i
because
of
this
gift
could
hear
the
invisible
vibrations
of
the
aether
so
that
without
harking
to
the
calling
of
our
recording
instruments
i
could
take
the
messages
which
came
continually
through
the
eternal
darkness
aye
even
better
than
they
and
now
it
may
be
the
better
understood
how
much
was
to
be
counted
that
i
had
grown
to
listen
for
a
voice
that
had
not
rung
in
mine
ears
for
an
eternity
and
yet
which
sang
sweet
and
clear
in
my
memorydreams
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
mirdath
the
beautiful
slept
within
my
soul
and
whispered
to
me
out
of
all
the
ages
and
then
one
day
at
the
fifteenth
hour
when
began
the
sleeptime
i
had
been
pondering
this
love
of
mine
that
lived
with
me
still
and
marvelling
that
my
memorydreams
held
the
voice
of
a
love
that
had
been
in
so
remote
an
age
and
pondering
and
dreaming
thus
as
a
young
man
may
i
could
fancy
this
aeonlost
one
were
whispering
beauty
into
my
ears
in
verity
so
clear
had
my
memory
grown
and
so
much
had
i
pondered
and
lo
as
i
stood
there
harking
and
communing
with
my
thoughts
i
thrilled
suddenly
as
if
i
had
been
smitten
for
out
of
all
the
everlasting
night
a
whisper
was
thrilling
and
thrilling
upon
my
more
subtile
hearing
through
four
long
years
had
i
listened
since
that
awakening
in
the
embrasure
when
but
a
youth
of
seventeen
and
now
out
of
the
worlddarkness
and
all
the
eternal
years
of
that
lost
life
which
now
i
live
in
this
present
age
of
ours
was
the
whisper
come
for
i
knew
it
upon
that
instant
and
yet
because
i
was
so
taught
to
wisdom
i
answered
by
no
name
but
sent
the
masterword
through
the
nightsending
it
with
my
brainelements
as
i
could
and
as
all
may
much
or
little
as
may
be
if
they
be
not
clods
and
moreover
i
knew
that
she
who
called
quietly
would
have
the
power
to
hear
without
instruments
if
indeed
it
were
she
and
if
it
were
but
one
of
the
false
callings
of
the
evil
forces
or
more
cunning
monsters
or
as
was
sometimes
thought
concerning
these
callings
the
house
of
silence
meddling
with
our
souls
then
would
they
have
no
power
to
say
the
masterword
for
this
had
been
proven
through
all
the
everlasting
and
lo
as
i
stood
trembling
and
striving
not
to
be
tense
which
destroys
the
receptivity
there
came
thrilling
round
and
round
my
spiritual
essence
the
throb
of
the
masterword
beating
steadily
in
the
night
as
doth
that
marvellous
sound
and
then
with
all
that
was
sweet
in
my
spirit
i
called
with
my
brain
elements
mirdath
mirdath
mirdath
and
at
that
instant
the
master
monstruwacan
entered
that
part
of
the
tower
of
observation
where
i
stood
and
seeing
my
face
stood
very
quiet
for
though
he
had
not
the
power
of
nighthearing
he
was
wise
and
thoughtful
and
took
much
account
of
my
gift
moreover
he
had
but
come
from
the
receiving
instrument
and
thought
vaguely
to
have
caught
the
throb
of
the
masterword
though
too
faint
to
come
proper
through
the
instrument
so
that
he
searched
for
me
in
that
i
who
had
the
hearing
might
listen
for
it
i
being
as
i
have
said
gifted
in
that
wise
and
to
him
i
told
something
of
my
story
and
my
thoughts
and
my
memories
and
of
that
awakening
and
thus
up
to
this
present
happening
and
he
hearkened
with
sympathy
and
a
troubled
and
wondering
heart
for
in
that
age
a
man
might
talk
sanely
upon
that
which
in
this
age
of
ours
would
be
accounted
foolishness
and
maybe
the
breathings
of
insanity
for
there
by
the
refinement
of
arts
of
mentality
and
the
results
of
strange
experiments
and
the
accomplishment
of
learning
men
were
abled
to
conceive
of
matters
now
closed
to
our
conceptions
even
as
we
of
this
day
may
haply
give
a
calm
ear
to
talk
that
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
would
have
been
surely
set
to
the
count
of
lunacy
and
this
is
very
clear
and
all
the
while
that
i
told
my
story
i
listened
with
my
spirit
but
save
for
a
sense
of
faint
happy
laughter
that
wrapped
about
me
i
heard
naught
and
nothing
more
all
that
day
here
let
me
put
down
that
because
of
my
memories
and
half
memories
i
would
time
and
again
dispute
with
our
learned
men
they
being
in
doubt
as
to
the
verity
of
that
olden
story
of
the
days
of
light
and
the
existence
of
the
sun
though
something
of
all
this
was
set
out
as
of
truth
in
our
oldest
records
but
i
remembering
told
them
many
tales
that
seemed
fairylike
to
them
and
entranced
their
hearts
even
whilst
i
angered
their
brains
which
refused
to
take
seriously
and
as
verity
that
which
their
hearts
accepted
gladly
even
as
we
receive
the
wonder
of
poetry
into
our
souls
but
the
master
monstruwacan
would
listen
to
aught
i
had
to
tell
aye
though
i
spoke
through
hours
and
so
it
would
be
odd
times
that
having
talked
long
drawing
my
stories
from
my
memorydreams
i
would
come
back
again
into
the
present
of
that
future
and
lo
all
the
monstruwacans
would
have
left
their
instruments
and
observations
and
recording
and
be
gathered
about
me
and
the
master
so
sunken
in
interest
that
he
not
to
have
discovered
them
neither
had
i
noticed
being
so
full
of
the
things
which
had
been
but
when
the
master
came
back
to
knowledge
of
that
present
he
would
rouse
and
chide
and
they
all
those
lesser
ones
would
fly
swiftly
and
guiltily
to
their
various
works
and
yet
so
i
have
thought
since
each
with
a
muddled
and
bewildered
and
thoughtful
air
upon
him
and
hungry
they
were
for
more
and
ever
wondering
and
setting
questions
about
and
so
it
was
also
with
those
othersthose
learned
ones
who
were
not
of
the
tower
of
observation
and
who
disbelieved
even
whilst
they
hungered
listen
would
they
though
i
talked
from
the
first
hour
which
was
the
dawn
to
the
fifteenth
hour
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
night
for
the
sleeptime
was
set
thus
after
other
usage
and
experiment
and
odd
whiles
i
found
that
there
were
among
them
men
of
extraordinary
learning
who
upheld
my
tellings
as
tales
of
verity
and
so
there
was
a
faction
but
later
there
grew
more
to
believe
and
whether
they
believed
or
not
all
were
ready
to
listen
so
that
i
might
have
spended
my
days
in
talk
only
that
i
had
my
work
to
do
but
the
master
monstruwacan
believed
from
the
beginning
and
was
wise
always
to
understand
so
that
i
loved
him
for
this
as
for
many
another
dear
quality
and
so
as
may
be
conceived
among
all
those
millions
i
was
singled
out
to
be
known
for
the
stories
that
i
told
went
downward
through
a
thousand
cities
and
presently
in
the
lowest
tier
of
the
underground
fields
an
hundred
miles
deep
in
the
earth
below
the
redoubt
i
found
that
the
very
ploughboys
knew
something
concerning
my
tellings
and
gathered
about
me
one
time
and
another
when
the
master
monstruwacan
and
i
had
gone
down
regarding
some
matter
that
dealt
with
the
earthcurrent
and
our
instruments
and
of
the
underground
fields
though
in
that
age
we
called
them
no
more
than
the
fields
i
should
set
down
a
little
for
they
were
the
mightiest
work
of
this
world
so
that
even
the
last
redoubt
was
but
a
small
thing
beside
them
an
hundred
miles
deep
lay
the
lowest
of
the
underground
fields
and
was
an
hundred
miles
from
side
to
side
every
way
and
above
it
there
were
three
hundred
and
six
fields
each
one
less
in
area
than
that
beneath
and
in
this
wise
they
tapered
until
the
topmost
field
which
lay
direct
beneath
the
lowermost
floor
of
the
great
redoubt
was
but
four
miles
every
way
and
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
these
fields
lying
one
beneath
the
other
formed
a
mighty
and
incredible
pyramid
of
country
lands
in
the
deep
earth
an
hundred
miles
from
the
base
unto
the
topmost
field
and
the
whole
was
sheathedin
at
the
sides
with
the
grey
metal
of
which
the
redoubt
was
builded
and
each
field
was
pillared
and
floored
beneath
the
soil
with
this
same
compound
of
wonder
and
so
was
it
secure
and
the
monsters
could
not
dig
into
that
mighty
garden
from
without
and
all
of
that
underground
land
was
lit
where
needed
by
the
earthcurrent
and
that
same
lifestream
fructified
the
soil
and
gave
life
and
blood
to
the
plants
and
to
the
trees
and
to
every
bush
and
natural
thing
and
the
making
of
those
fields
had
taken
maybe
a
million
years
and
the
dump
thereof
had
been
cast
into
the
crack
whence
came
the
earthcurrent
and
which
had
bottom
beyond
all
soundings
and
this
underground
country
had
its
own
winds
and
aircurrents
so
that
to
my
memory
it
was
in
no
ways
connected
to
the
monstrous
airshafts
of
the
pyramid
but
in
this
i
may
be
mistaken
for
it
has
not
been
given
to
me
to
know
all
that
is
to
be
known
concerning
that
vast
redoubt
nor
by
any
one
man
could
so
much
knowledge
be
achieved
yet
that
there
were
wise
and
justly
promoted
winds
in
that
underground
country
i
do
know
for
healthful
and
sweet
they
were
and
in
the
cornfields
there
was
the
sweet
rustle
of
grain
and
the
glad
silken
laughter
of
poppies
all
beneath
a
warm
and
happy
light
and
here
did
the
millions
walk
and
take
excursion
and
go
orderly
or
not
even
as
in
these
days
and
all
this
have
i
seen
and
the
talk
of
a
thousand
lovers
in
the
gardens
of
that
place
comes
back
to
me
and
with
it
all
the
memory
of
my
dear
one
and
of
a
faint
calling
that
would
seem
to
whisper
about
me
at
times
but
so
faint
and
attenuated
that
even
i
who
had
the
nighthearing
could
not
catch
its
import
and
so
went
listening
ever
the
more
intently
and
oft
times
calling
now
there
was
a
law
in
the
pyramid
tried
and
healthful
which
held
that
no
male
should
have
freedom
to
adventure
into
the
night
land
before
the
age
of
twentytwo
and
no
female
ever
yet
that
after
such
age
if
a
youth
desired
greatly
to
make
the
adventure
he
should
receive
three
lectures
upon
the
dangers
of
which
we
had
knowledge
and
a
strict
account
of
the
mutilatings
and
horrid
deeds
done
to
those
who
had
so
adventured
and
if
after
this
had
passed
over
him
he
still
desired
and
if
he
were
accounted
healthful
and
sane
then
should
he
be
allowed
to
make
the
adventure
and
it
was
accounted
honour
to
the
youth
who
should
add
to
the
knowledge
of
the
pyramid
but
to
all
such
as
went
forth
into
the
danger
of
the
night
land
there
was
set
beneath
the
skin
of
the
inner
side
of
the
left
forearm
a
small
capsule
and
when
the
wound
had
healed
then
might
the
youth
make
the
adventure
and
the
wherefore
of
this
was
that
the
spirit
of
the
youth
might
be
saved
if
he
were
entrapped
for
then
upon
the
honour
of
his
soul
must
he
bite
forth
the
capsule
and
immediately
his
spirit
would
have
safety
in
death
and
by
this
shall
you
know
somewhat
the
grim
and
horrid
danger
of
the
dark
land
and
this
i
have
set
down
because
later
i
was
to
make
huge
adventure
into
those
lands
and
even
at
this
time
some
thought
of
the
same
had
come
to
me
for
always
i
went
listening
for
that
quiet
calling
and
twice
i
sent
the
masterword
throbbing
solemnly
through
the
everlasting
night
yet
this
i
did
no
more
without
certainty
for
the
word
must
not
be
used
lightly
but
often
would
i
say
with
my
brainelements
mirdath
mirdathsending
the
name
out
into
the
darkness
and
sometimes
would
i
seem
to
hear
the
faint
thrilling
of
the
aether
around
me
as
though
one
answered
but
weakly
as
it
were
with
a
weakened
spirit
or
by
instrument
that
lacked
of
its
earthforce
and
thus
for
a
great
while
there
was
no
certainty
but
only
a
strange
anxiousness
and
no
clear
answer
then
one
day
as
i
stood
by
the
instruments
in
the
tower
of
observation
at
the
thirteenth
hour
there
came
the
thrilling
of
beaten
aether
all
about
me
as
it
were
that
all
the
void
was
disturbed
and
i
made
the
sign
for
silence
so
that
the
men
moved
not
in
all
the
tower
but
bowed
over
their
breathingbells
that
all
disturbance
might
cease
and
again
came
the
gentle
thrilling
and
broke
out
into
a
clear
low
calling
in
my
brain
and
the
calling
was
my
namethe
oldearth
name
of
this
day
and
not
the
name
of
that
age
and
the
name
smote
me
with
a
frightenedness
of
fresh
awakening
memories
and
immediately
i
sent
the
masterword
into
the
night
and
all
the
aether
was
full
of
movement
and
a
silence
came
and
later
a
beat
afar
off
in
the
void
of
night
which
only
i
in
all
that
great
redoubt
could
hear
until
the
heavier
vibrations
were
come
and
in
a
moment
there
was
all
about
me
the
throbbing
of
the
masterword
beating
in
the
night
a
sure
answer
yet
before
this
i
knew
that
mirdath
had
called
but
now
had
surety
and
immediately
i
said
mirdath
making
use
of
the
instruments
and
there
came
a
swift
and
beautiful
answer
for
out
of
the
dark
there
stole
an
old
lovename
that
she
only
had
ever
used
to
me
and
presently
i
minded
me
of
the
men
and
signed
to
them
that
they
should
continue
for
the
records
must
not
be
broken
and
now
i
had
the
communication
full
established
and
by
me
stood
the
master
monstruwacan
quietly
as
any
young
monstruwacan
waiting
with
slips
to
make
any
notes
that
were
needful
and
keeping
a
strict
eye
upon
those
others
but
not
unkindly
and
so
for
a
space
of
wonder
i
had
speech
with
that
girl
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
world
who
had
knowledge
of
my
name
and
of
the
oldearth
lovename
and
named
herself
mirdath
and
much
i
questioned
her
and
presently
to
my
sorrow
for
it
seemed
that
her
name
was
not
truly
mirdath
but
naani
neither
had
she
known
my
name
but
that
in
the
library
of
that
place
where
she
abode
there
had
been
a
story
of
one
named
by
my
name
and
called
by
that
sweet
lovename
which
she
had
sent
out
somewhat
ruthless
into
the
night
and
the
girls
name
had
been
mirdath
and
when
first
she
naani
had
called
there
had
come
back
to
her
a
cry
of
mirdath
mirdath
and
this
had
minded
her
so
strangely
of
that
olden
story
which
had
stayed
in
her
memory
that
she
had
answered
as
the
maid
in
that
book
might
have
answered
and
thus
did
it
seem
that
the
utter
romance
of
my
memorylove
had
vanished
and
i
stood
strangely
troubled
for
sorrow
of
a
love
of
olden
times
yet
even
then
i
marvelled
that
any
book
should
have
story
so
much
like
to
mine
not
heeding
that
the
history
of
all
love
is
writ
with
one
pen
yet
even
then
in
that
hour
of
my
strange
and
quaintly
foolish
pain
there
came
a
thing
that
set
me
thrilling
though
more
afterwards
when
i
came
to
think
afresh
upon
it
for
the
girl
who
spoke
to
me
through
the
night
made
some
wonder
that
my
voice
were
not
deeper
yet
in
quiet
fashion
and
as
one
who
says
a
thing
scarce
wotting
what
they
say
but
even
to
me
then
there
came
a
sudden
hope
for
in
the
olden
days
of
this
present
age
my
voice
had
been
very
deep
and
i
said
to
her
that
maybe
the
man
in
the
book
was
said
to
have
had
a
deep
tone
of
speech
but
she
seeming
puzzled
said
nay
and
at
that
i
questioned
her
the
more
but
only
to
the
trouble
of
her
memory
and
understanding
and
strange
must
it
seem
that
we
two
should
talk
on
so
trivial
a
matter
when
there
was
so
much
else
that
we
had
need
to
exchange
thought
upon
for
were
a
man
in
this
present
day
to
have
speech
with
those
who
may
live
within
that
red
planet
of
mars
within
the
sky
scarce
could
the
wonder
of
it
exceed
the
wonder
of
a
human
voice
coming
through
that
night
unto
the
great
redoubt
out
of
all
that
lost
darkness
for
indeed
this
must
have
been
the
breaking
of
maybe
a
million
years
of
silence
and
already
as
i
came
to
know
later
was
the
news
passing
downward
from
city
to
city
through
all
the
vast
pyramid
so
that
the
hourslips
were
full
of
the
news
and
every
city
eager
and
excited
and
waiting
and
i
better
known
in
that
one
moment
than
in
all
my
life
before
for
that
previous
calling
had
been
but
vaguely
put
about
and
then
set
to
the
count
of
a
nature
blown
upon
overeasily
by
spiritwinds
of
the
halfmemory
of
dreams
though
it
is
indeed
true
as
i
have
set
down
before
this
that
my
tales
concerning
the
early
days
of
the
world
when
the
sun
was
visible
and
full
of
light
had
gone
down
through
all
the
cities
and
had
much
comment
and
setting
forth
in
the
hourslips
and
were
a
cause
for
speech
and
argument
now
concerning
the
voice
of
this
girl
coming
to
us
through
the
darkness
of
the
world
i
will
set
out
that
which
she
had
to
tell
and
this
indeed
but
verified
the
tellings
of
our
most
ancient
records
which
had
so
long
been
treated
over
lightly
there
was
it
would
seem
somewhere
out
in
the
lonesome
dark
of
the
outer
lands
but
at
what
distance
none
could
ever
discover
a
second
redoubt
that
was
a
threesided
pyramid
and
moderate
small
being
no
more
than
a
mile
in
height
and
scarce
three
quarters
of
a
mile
along
the
bases
when
this
redoubt
was
first
builded
it
had
been
upon
the
far
shore
of
a
sea
where
now
was
no
sea
and
it
had
been
raised
by
those
wandering
humans
who
had
grown
weary
of
wandering
and
weary
of
the
danger
of
night
attacks
by
the
tribes
of
halfhuman
monsters
which
began
to
inhabit
the
earth
even
so
early
as
the
days
when
the
halfgloom
was
upon
the
world
and
he
that
had
made
the
plan
upon
which
it
was
builded
was
one
who
had
seen
the
great
redoubt
having
lived
there
in
the
beginning
but
escaped
because
of
a
correction
set
upon
him
for
his
spirit
of
irresponsibility
which
had
made
him
to
cause
disturbance
among
the
orderly
ones
in
the
lowest
city
of
the
great
redoubt
yet
in
time
he
too
had
come
to
be
tamed
by
the
weight
of
fear
of
the
evergrowing
hordes
of
monsters
and
the
forces
that
were
abroad
and
so
he
being
a
masterspirit
planned
and
builded
the
smaller
redoubt
being
aided
thereto
by
four
millions
who
also
were
weary
of
the
harass
of
the
monsters
but
until
then
had
been
wanderers
because
of
the
restlessness
of
their
blood
and
they
had
chosen
that
place
because
there
they
had
discovered
a
sign
of
the
earthcurrent
in
a
great
valley
which
led
to
the
shore
for
without
the
earthcurrent
no
refuge
could
have
existence
and
whilst
many
builded
and
guarded
and
cared
for
the
great
camp
in
which
all
lived
others
worked
within
a
great
shaft
and
in
ten
years
had
made
this
to
a
distance
of
many
miles
and
therewith
they
tapt
the
earthcurrent
but
not
a
great
stream
yet
a
sufficiency
as
was
believed
and
presently
after
many
years
they
had
builded
the
pyramid
and
taken
up
their
refuge
there
and
made
them
instruments
and
ordained
monstruwacans
so
that
they
had
speech
daily
with
the
great
pyramid
and
thus
for
many
long
ages
and
the
earthcurrent
then
to
begin
to
fail
and
though
they
laboured
through
many
thousands
of
years
they
came
to
no
better
resource
and
so
it
was
they
ceased
to
have
communication
with
the
great
redoubt
for
the
current
had
a
lack
of
power
to
work
the
instruments
and
the
recording
instruments
ceased
to
be
sensible
of
our
messages
and
thereafter
came
a
million
years
maybe
of
silence
with
ever
the
birthing
and
marrying
and
dying
of
those
lonesome
humans
and
they
grew
less
and
some
put
this
to
the
lack
of
the
earthcurrent
which
dwindled
slowly
through
the
centuries
of
that
eternity
and
once
in
a
thousand
years
maybe
one
among
them
would
be
sensitive
and
abled
to
hear
beyond
ordinary
and
to
these
at
times
there
would
seem
to
come
the
thrilling
of
the
aether
so
that
such
an
one
would
go
listening
and
sometimes
seem
to
catch
half
messages
and
so
awaken
a
great
interest
in
all
the
pyramid
and
there
would
be
turning
up
of
old
records
and
many
words
and
writings
and
attempts
to
send
the
masterword
through
the
night
in
which
doubtless
sometimes
they
succeeded
for
there
was
set
down
in
the
records
of
the
great
redoubt
certain
occasions
on
which
there
had
come
the
call
of
the
masterword
which
had
been
arranged
and
made
holy
between
the
two
redoubts
in
the
early
days
of
that
second
life
of
this
world
yet
now
for
an
hundred
thousand
years
there
had
been
none
sensitive
and
in
that
time
the
people
of
the
pyramid
had
become
no
more
than
ten
thousand
and
the
earthcurrent
was
weak
and
powerless
to
put
the
joy
of
life
into
them
so
that
they
went
listlessly
but
deemed
it
not
strange
because
of
so
many
aeons
of
usage
and
then
to
the
wonder
of
all
the
earthcurrent
had
put
forth
a
new
power
so
that
young
people
ceased
to
be
old
oversoon
and
there
was
happiness
and
a
certain
joy
in
the
living
and
a
strange
birthing
of
children
such
as
had
not
been
through
half
a
million
years
and
then
came
a
new
thing
naani
the
daughter
of
the
master
monstruwacan
of
that
redoubt
had
shown
to
all
that
she
was
sensitive
for
she
had
perceived
odd
vibrations
afloat
in
the
night
and
concerning
these
she
told
her
father
and
presently
because
their
blood
moved
afresh
in
their
bodies
they
had
heart
to
discover
the
plans
of
the
ancient
instruments
for
the
instruments
had
long
rusted
and
been
forgotten
and
so
they
builded
them
a
new
instrument
to
send
forth
a
message
for
they
had
no
memory
at
that
time
that
the
brainelements
had
power
to
do
thus
though
mayhap
their
brainelements
were
weakened
through
so
many
ages
of
starvation
of
the
earthcurrent
and
could
not
have
obeyed
even
had
their
masters
known
all
that
we
of
the
great
redoubt
knew
and
when
the
instrument
was
finished
to
naani
was
given
the
right
to
call
first
across
the
dark
to
discover
whether
indeed
after
that
million
years
of
silence
they
were
yet
companied
upon
this
earth
or
whether
they
were
in
truth
lonelythe
last
poor
thousands
of
the
humans
and
a
great
and
painful
excitement
came
upon
the
people
of
the
lesser
pyramid
for
the
loneliness
of
the
world
pressed
upon
them
and
it
was
to
them
as
though
we
in
this
age
called
to
a
star
across
the
abyss
of
space
and
because
of
the
excitement
and
pain
of
the
moment
naani
called
only
vaguely
with
the
instrument
into
the
dark
and
lo
in
a
moment
as
it
seemed
there
came
all
about
her
in
the
night
the
solemn
throb
of
the
masterword
beating
in
the
night
and
naani
cried
out
that
she
was
answered
and
as
may
be
thought
many
of
the
people
wept
and
some
prayed
and
some
were
silent
but
others
beseeched
her
that
she
call
again
and
quickly
to
have
further
speech
with
those
of
their
kind
and
naani
spoke
the
masterword
into
the
night
and
directly
there
came
a
calling
all
about
her
mirdath
mirdath
and
the
strange
wonder
of
it
made
her
silent
a
moment
but
when
she
would
have
made
reply
the
instrument
had
ceased
to
work
and
she
could
have
no
further
speech
at
that
time
this
as
may
be
thought
occasioned
much
distress
and
constant
work
they
had
between
the
instrument
and
the
earthcurrent
to
discover
the
reason
for
this
failing
but
could
not
for
a
great
while
and
in
that
time
oft
did
naani
hear
the
call
of
mirdath
thrilling
about
her
and
twice
there
came
the
solemn
beat
of
the
masterword
in
the
night
yet
never
had
she
the
power
to
answer
and
all
that
while
as
i
learned
in
time
was
she
stirred
with
a
quaint
ache
at
heart
by
the
voice
that
called
mirdath
as
it
might
be
the
spirit
of
love
searching
for
its
mate
for
this
is
how
she
put
it
and
thus
it
chanced
that
the
constant
thrilling
of
this
name
about
her
woke
her
to
memory
of
a
book
she
had
read
in
early
years
and
but
half
understood
for
it
was
ancient
and
writ
in
an
olden
fashion
and
it
set
out
the
love
of
a
man
and
a
maid
and
the
maids
name
was
mirdath
and
so
because
she
was
full
of
this
great
awakening
of
those
ages
of
silence
and
the
calling
of
that
name
she
found
the
book
again
and
read
it
many
times
and
grew
to
a
sound
love
of
the
beauty
of
that
tale
and
presently
when
the
instrument
was
made
right
she
called
into
the
night
the
name
of
that
man
within
the
book
and
so
it
came
about
that
i
had
hoped
too
much
yet
even
now
was
i
strangely
unsure
whether
to
cease
from
hoping
and
one
other
thing
there
is
which
i
would
make
clear
many
and
oft
a
time
had
i
heard
a
thrilling
of
sweet
faint
laughter
about
me
and
the
stirring
of
the
aether
by
words
too
gentle
to
come
clearly
and
these
i
make
no
doubt
came
from
naani
using
her
brainelements
unwittingly
and
in
ignorance
but
very
eager
to
answer
my
callings
and
having
no
knowledge
that
far
off
across
the
blackness
of
the
world
they
thrilled
about
me
constantly
and
after
naani
had
made
clear
all
that
i
have
set
out
concerning
the
lesser
refuge
she
told
further
how
that
food
was
not
plentiful
with
them
though
until
the
reawakening
of
the
earthcurrent
they
had
gone
unknowing
of
this
being
of
small
appetite
and
caring
little
for
aught
but
now
wakened
and
newly
hungry
they
savoured
a
lack
of
taste
in
all
that
they
ate
and
this
we
could
well
conceive
from
our
reasonings
and
theory
but
happily
not
from
our
knowledge
and
we
said
unto
them
that
the
soil
had
lost
its
life
and
the
crops
therefrom
were
not
vital
and
a
great
while
it
would
take
for
the
earth
within
their
pyramid
to
receive
back
the
lifeelements
and
we
told
them
certain
ways
by
which
they
might
bring
a
more
speedy
life
to
the
soil
and
this
they
were
eager
to
do
being
freshly
alive
after
so
long
a
time
of
halflife
and
now
you
must
know
that
in
all
the
great
redoubt
the
story
went
downwards
swiftly
and
was
published
in
all
the
hoursheets
with
many
comments
and
the
libraries
were
full
of
those
who
would
look
up
the
olden
records
which
for
so
long
had
been
forgotten
or
taken
as
we
of
this
day
would
say
with
a
pinch
of
salt
and
all
the
time
i
was
pestered
with
questions
so
that
had
i
not
been
determined
i
should
scarce
have
been
allowed
to
sleep
moreover
so
much
was
writ
about
me
and
my
power
to
hear
and
divers
stories
concerning
tales
of
love
that
i
had
been
like
to
have
grown
mazed
to
take
note
of
it
all
yet
some
note
i
did
take
and
much
i
found
pleasant
but
some
displeasing
and
for
the
rest
i
was
not
spoiled
as
the
saying
goes
for
i
had
my
work
to
do
moreover
i
was
always
busied
listening
and
having
speech
through
the
darkness
though
if
any
saw
me
so
they
would
question
and
because
of
this
i
kept
much
to
the
tower
of
observation
where
was
the
master
monstruwacan
and
a
greater
discipline
and
then
began
a
fresh
matter
though
but
an
old
enough
trick
for
i
speak
now
of
the
days
that
followed
that
reopening
of
the
talk
between
the
pyramids
oft
would
speech
come
to
us
out
of
the
night
and
there
would
be
tales
of
the
sore
need
of
the
lesser
redoubt
and
callings
for
help
yet
when
i
sent
the
masterword
abroad
there
would
be
no
answering
and
so
i
feared
that
the
monsters
and
forces
of
evil
knew
yet
at
times
the
masterword
would
answer
to
us
beating
steadily
in
the
night
and
when
we
questioned
afresh
we
knew
that
they
in
the
lesser
redoubt
had
caught
the
beat
of
the
masterword
and
so
made
reply
though
it
had
not
been
they
who
had
made
the
previous
talk
which
we
had
sought
to
test
by
the
word
and
then
they
would
make
contradiction
of
all
that
had
been
spoken
so
cunningly
so
that
we
knew
the
monsters
and
forces
had
sought
to
tempt
some
from
the
safety
of
the
redoubt
yet
was
this
no
new
thing
as
i
have
made
to
hint
saving
that
it
grew
now
to
a
greater
persistence
and
there
was
a
loathsome
cunning
in
the
using
of
this
new
knowledge
to
the
making
of
wicked
and
false
messages
by
those
evil
things
of
the
night
land
and
it
told
to
us
as
i
have
made
remark
how
that
those
monsters
and
forces
had
a
full
awaredness
of
the
speech
between
the
pyramids
yet
could
they
have
no
power
to
say
the
masterword
so
had
we
some
test
left
and
a
way
to
sure
knowledge
of
what
made
talk
in
the
night
and
all
that
i
have
told
should
bring
to
those
of
this
age
something
of
the
yet
unbegotten
terror
of
that
and
a
quiet
and
sound
thankfulness
to
god
that
we
suffer
not
as
humanity
shall
yet
suffer
but
for
all
this
let
it
not
be
thought
that
they
of
that
age
accounted
it
as
suffering
but
as
no
more
than
the
usual
of
human
existence
and
by
this
may
we
know
that
we
can
meet
all
circumstances
and
use
ourselves
to
them
and
live
through
them
wisely
if
we
be
but
prudent
and
consider
means
of
invention
and
through
all
the
night
land
there
was
an
extraordinary
awakening
among
the
monsters
and
forces
so
that
the
instruments
made
constant
note
of
greater
powers
at
work
out
there
in
the
darkness
and
the
monstruwacans
were
busied
recording
and
keeping
a
very
strict
watch
and
so
was
there
at
all
that
time
a
sense
of
difference
and
awakening
and
of
wonders
about
and
to
come
and
from
the
country
whence
comes
the
great
laughter
the
laughter
sounded
constant

as
it
were
an
uncomfortable
and
heartshaking
voicethunder
rolling
thence
over
the
lands
out
from
the
unknown
east
and
the
pit
of
the
red
smoke
filled
all
the
deep
valley
with
redness
so
that
the
smoke
rose
above
the
edge
and
hid
the
bases
of
the
towers
upon
the
far
side
and
the
giants
could
be
seen
plentiful
around
the
kilns
to
the
east
and
from
the
kilns
great
belches
of
fire
though
the
meaning
of
it
as
of
all
else
we
could
not
say
but
only
the
cause
and
from
the
mountain
of
the
voice
which
rose
to
the
southeast
of
the
southeast
watcher
and
of
which
i
have
made
no
telling
hitherto
in
this
faulty
settingout
i
heard
for
the
first
time
in
that
life
the
calling
of
the
voice
and
though
the
records
made
mention
of
it
yet
not
often
was
it
heard
and
the
calling
was
shrill
and
very
peculiar
and
distressful
and
horrible
as
though
a
giantwoman
hungering
strangely
shouted
unknown
words
across
the
night
and
this
was
how
it
seemed
to
me
and
many
thought
this
to
describe
the
sound
and
by
all
this
may
you
perceive
how
that
land
was
awakened
and
other
tricks
there
were
to
entice
us
into
the
night
land
and
once
a
call
came
thrilling
in
the
aether
and
told
to
us
that
certain
humans
had
escaped
from
the
lesser
redoubt
and
drew
nigh
to
us
but
were
faint
for
food
and
craved
succour
yet
when
we
sent
the
masterword
into
the
night
the
creatures
without
could
make
no
reply
which
was
a
very
happy
thing
for
our
souls
for
we
had
been
all
mightily
exercised
in
our
hearts
by
this
one
message
and
now
had
proof
that
it
was
but
a
trap
and
constantly
and
at
all
hours
i
would
have
speech
with
naani
of
the
lesser
redoubt
for
i
had
taught
her
how
she
might
send
her
thoughts
through
the
night
with
her
brainelements
but
not
to
overuse
this
power
for
it
exhausts
the
body
and
the
powers
of
the
mind
if
it
be
abused
by
exceeding
usage
yet
despite
that
i
had
taught
her
the
use
of
her
brainelements
she
sent
her
message
always
without
strength
save
when
she
had
use
of
the
instrument
and
this
i
set
to
the
cause
that
she
had
not
the
health
force
needful
but
apart
from
this
she
had
the
nighthearing
very
keen
though
less
than
mine
and
so
with
many
times
of
speech
and
constant
tellings
of
our
doings
and
thoughts
we
drew
near
in
the
spirit
to
one
another
and
had
always
a
feeling
in
our
hearts
that
we
had
been
given
previous
acquaintance
and
this
as
may
be
thought
thrilled
my
heart
very
strangely
iv
the
hushing
of
the
voice
dearest
thine
own
feet
tread
the
world
at
night
treading
as
moonflakes
step
across
a
dark
kissing
the
very
dew
to
holier
light

thy
voice
a
song
past
mountains
which
to
hark
frightens
my
soul
with
an
utter
lost
delight
now
one
night
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
hour
as
i
made
ready
to
sleep
there
came
all
about
me
the
thrilling
of
the
aether
as
happened
oft
in
those
days
but
the
thrilling
had
a
strange
power
in
it
and
in
my
soul
the
voice
of
naani
sounded
plain
all
within
and
about
me
yet
though
i
knew
it
to
be
the
voice
of
naani
i
answered
not
immediately
save
to
send
the
sure
question
of
the
masterword
into
the
night
and
directly
i
heard
the
answer
the
masterword
beating
steadily
in
the
night
and
i
questioned
naani
why
she
had
speech
with
me
by
the
instrument
at
that
time
when
all
were
sleeping
and
the
watch
set
among
the
monstruwacans
for
they
in
the
little
pyramid
had
their
sleeptime
to
commence
at
the
eleventh
hour
so
that
by
this
it
was
five
hours
advanced
towards
the
time
of
waking
and
naani
should
have
slept
nor
have
been
abroad
to
the
tower
of
observation
apart
from
her
father
for
i
supposed
that
she
spoke
by
the
instrument
her
voice
sounding
very
clear
in
my
brain
yet
to
this
question
she
made
no
answer
in
kind
but
gave
a
certain
thing
into
my
spirit
which
set
me
trembling
for
she
said
certain
words
that
began
dearest
thine
own
feet
tread
the
world
at
night
and
it
well
may
be
that
she
set
me
to
tremble
for
as
the
words
grew
about
me
there
wakened
a
memorydream
how
that
i
had
made
these
same
words
to
mirdath
the
beautiful
in
the
longgone
eternity
of
this
our
age
when
she
had
died
and
left
me
alone
in
all
the
world
and
i
was
weak
a
little
with
the
tumult
and
force
of
my
emotion
but
in
a
moment
i
called
eagerly
with
my
brainelements
to
naani
to
give
some
explaining
of
this
thing
that
she
had
spoken
to
the
utter
troubling
of
my
heart
yet
once
more
she
made
no
direct
answer
but
spoke
the
words
again
to
me
across
all
the
dark
of
the
world
and
it
came
to
me
suddenly
that
it
was
not
naani
that
spoke
but
mirdath
the
beautiful
from
out
of
all
the
everlasting
night
and
i
called
mirdath
mirdath
with
my
brainelements
into
the
night
and
lo
the
far
faint
voice
spoke
again
to
my
spirit
through
all
the
darkness
of
eternity
saying
again
those
words
yet
though
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
mirdath
the
beautiful
it
was
also
the
voice
of
naani
and
i
knew
in
all
my
heart
that
this
thing
was
in
verity
and
that
it
had
been
given
to
me
to
be
birthed
once
more
into
this
world
in
the
livingtime
of
that
only
one
with
whom
my
spirit
and
essence
hath
mated
in
all
ages
through
the
everlasting
and
i
called
with
my
brainelements
and
all
my
strength
to
naani
but
there
came
no
answer
neither
sign
of
hearing
though
through
hours
i
called
and
thus
at
last
i
came
to
an
utter
exhaustion
but
neither
could
be
quiet
nor
sleep
yet
presently
i
slept
and
when
i
waked
my
first
memory
was
of
the
wondrous
thing
which
had
befallen
in
the
sleeptime
for
none
in
all
this
world
could
have
known
those
words
save
it
had
been
the
spirit
of
mirdath
my
beautiful
one
looking
from
above
my
shoulder
in
that
utterlost
time
as
i
made
those
words
to
her
out
of
an
aching
and
a
broken
heart
and
the
voice
had
been
the
voice
of
mirdath
and
the
voice
of
mirdath
had
been
the
voice
of
naani
and
what
shall
any
say
to
this
save
that
which
i
had
in
my
heart
and
immediately
i
called
to
naani
once
and
again
twice
and
in
a
little
moment
there
came
all
about
me
the
throbbing
of
the
masterword
beating
solemnly
in
the
night
and
i
sent
the
masterword
to
give
assurance
and
immediately
the
voice
of
naani
a
little
weak
as
was
it
always
when
she
had
not
the
instrument
but
sent
the
message
with
her
brainelements
and
i
answered
her
and
questioned
her
eagerly
concerning
her
sayings
of
the
past
time
of
sleep
but
she
disclaimed
and
made
clear
to
me
that
she
had
no
knowledge
of
having
spoken
but
had
slept
through
all
that
time
of
which
i
made
to
tell
and
indeed
had
dreamed
a
very
strange
dream
and
for
a
little
while
i
was
confused
and
meditated
not
knowing
what
to
think
but
came
suddenly
again
to
a
knowledge
that
naanis
far
voice
was
thrilling
the
aether
all
about
and
that
she
would
tell
to
me
her
dream
which
had
set
strong
upon
her
mind
and
she
told
the
dream
to
me
and
in
the
dream
she
had
seen
a
tall
dark
man
built
very
big
and
dressed
in
unfamiliar
clothing
and
the
man
had
been
in
a
little
room
and
very
sorrowful
and
lonesome
and
in
her
dream
she
had
gone
nigh
to
him
and
presently
the
man
made
to
write
that
he
might
ease
him
by
giving
expression
to
his
sorrow
and
naani
had
been
able
to
read
the
words
that
he
wrote
though
to
her
waking
spirit
the
language
in
which
they
were
writ
was
strange
and
unknown
yet
she
could
not
remember
what
he
had
writ
save
but
one
short
line
and
this
she
had
mind
of
in
that
he
had
writ
the
word
mirdath
above
and
she
spoke
of
the
strangeness
of
this
thing
that
she
should
dream
of
this
name
but
supposed
that
i
had
fixed
it
upon
her
by
my
first
callings
and
then
did
i
with
something
of
a
tremble
in
my
spirit
ask
naani
to
tell
me
what
she
remembered
of
the
writing
of
that
big
sorrowful
stranger
and
in
a
little
moment
her
far
voice
said
these
words
all
about
me
dearest
thine
own
feet
tread
the
world
at
night
but
no
more
had
she
memory
of
yet
it
was
a
sufficiency
and
i
maybe
with
a
mad
strange
triumph
in
my
soul
said
unto
her
with
my
brainelements
that
which
remained
of
those
words
and
my
spirit
felt
them
strike
upon
the
spirit
of
naani
and
awake
her
memory
as
with
the
violence
of
a
blow
and
for
a
little
while
she
stumbled
dumb
before
so
much
newness
and
certainly
and
her
spirit
then
to
waken
and
she
near
wept
with
the
fright
and
the
sudden
new
wonder
of
this
thing
and
immediately
all
about
me
there
came
her
voice
thrilling
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
mirdath
and
the
voice
of
naani
and
i
heard
the
tears
of
her
spirit
make
pure
and
wonderful
the
bewildered
and
growing
gladness
of
her
far
voice
and
she
asked
me
as
one
who
had
suddenly
opened
the
gates
of
memory
whether
she
might
be
truly
mirdath
and
i
utter
weak
and
shaken
strangely
because
of
this
splendour
of
fulfilment
could
make
no
instant
answer
and
she
asked
again
but
using
mine
old
lovename
and
with
a
sureness
in
her
far
voice
and
still
i
was
so
strangely
dumb
and
the
blood
to
thud
peculiar
in
mine
ears
and
this
to
pass
and
speech
to
come
swift
and
this
way
to
be
that
meeting
of
our
spirits
across
all
the
everlasting
night
and
you
shall
have
for
a
memorypicture
how
that
naani
stood
there
in
the
world
in
that
far
eternity
and
with
her
spirit
having
speech
with
mine
looked
back
through
the
partopened
gates
of
her
memory
into
the
past
of
this
our
life
and
age
yet
more
than
this
she
saw
and
more
than
was
given
to
me
in
that
age
for
she
had
memory
now
and
sight
of
other
instances
and
of
other
comings
together
which
had
some
confusion
and
but
halfmeanings
to
me
yet
of
this
our
present
age
and
life
we
spoke
as
of
some
yesterday
but
very
hallowed
now
as
may
be
conceived
the
wonder
of
this
surety
which
had
come
into
my
life
stirred
me
fiercely
to
its
completion
for
all
my
heart
and
spirit
cried
out
to
be
with
that
one
who
was
mirdath
and
now
spoke
with
the
voice
of
naani
yet
how
should
this
be
won
for
none
among
all
the
learned
men
of
that
mighty
pyramid
knew
the
position
of
the
lesser
redoubt
neither
could
the
records
and
histories
of
the
world
give
us
that
knowledge
only
that
there
was
a
general
thought
among
the
students
and
the
monstruwacans
that
it
lay
between
the
northwest
and
the
northeast
but
no
man
had
any
surety
neither
could
any
conceive
of
the
distance
from
us
of
that
refuge
and
counting
all
this
there
was
yet
the
incredible
danger
and
peril
of
the
night
land
and
the
hunger
and
desolation
of
the
outer
lands
which
were
sometimes
named
the
unknown
lands
and
i
spoke
much
with
naani
concerning
this
matter
of
their
position
yet
neither
she
nor
her
father
the
master
monstruwacan
of
that
refuge
had
any
knowing
either
of
our
position
only
that
the
builder
of
the
lesser
redoubt
had
come
out
of
the
southward
world
in
the
beginning
as
they
had
knowledge
of
by
the
records
also
the
father
of
naani
set
that
ancient
compass
to
bear
for
as
he
made
explanation
to
us
through
the
instrument
so
great
a
power
of
the
earthcurrent
must
be
ours
that
perchance
it
was
our
force
which
did
affect
the
pointer
from
steadfastness
for
indeed
the
needle
did
swing
in
an
arc
as
we
heard
that
held
between
the
north
and
the
south
within
the
westward
arc
but
this
it
had
done
ever
with
them
and
so
was
a
very
helpless
guide
save
that
maybe
as
we
had
thought
the
force
of
the
earthcurrent
that
was
with
us
had
in
truth
some
power
to
pull
the
needle
towards
us
and
if
this
were
so
of
verity
we
made
a
reckoning
that
set
the
lesser
redoubt
to
the
north
and
they
did
likewise
and
put
us
to
the
south
yet
was
it
all
built
upon
the
sand
of
guesswork
and
nothing
to
adventure
the
life
and
soul
upon
now
we
of
curiosity
though
a
million
times
had
it
been
done
in
the
past
ages
set
the
compass
before
us
having
it
from
the
great
museum
but
as
ever
in
that
age
it
did
spin
if
we
but
stirred
the
needle
and
would
stop
nowheres
with
surety
for
the
flow
of
the
earthcurrent
from
the
crack
beneath
the
pyramid
had
a
power
to
affect
it
away
from
the
north
and
to
set
it
wandering
and
this
may
seem
very
strange
to
this
present
age
yet
to
that
it
was
most
true
to
the
seeming
nature
of
things
and
harder
to
believe
that
ever
it
did
once
point
steadfastly
to
prove
a
guide
of
sureness
and
unfailing
for
be
it
known
we
knew
the
positions
of
the
land
by
tradition
coming
from
that
ancient
time
when
in
the
halfgloom
they
had
builded
the
pyramid
they
having
known
the
use
of
that
ancient
compass
and
with
sight
of
the
sun
had
named
the
positions
though
we
of
that
far
future
day
had
forgotten
the
very
beginnings
of
those
names
of
direction
and
used
them
but
because
our
fathers
did
a
million
years
and
more
and
likewise
we
did
the
same
with
the
names
of
the
day
and
the
night
and
the
weeks
and
the
months
and
the
years
though
of
the
visible
markings
of
these
there
was
nothing
but
only
and
always
the
everlasting
night
yet
the
same
seeming
very
natural
to
that
people
now
naani
having
heed
to
my
constant
questions
craved
with
an
utter
keen
hunger
that
i
might
come
to
her
but
yet
forbade
it
in
that
it
were
better
to
live
and
commune
in
the
spirit
than
to
risk
my
soul
and
mayhaps
die
in
the
foolishness
of
trying
to
find
her
in
all
the
darkness
of
the
dead
world
yet
no
heed
had
i
taken
of
her
commands
had
i
but
known
of
a
surety
the
direction
in
which
she
might
be
discovered
and
gained
some
knowledge
of
the
space
between
for
this
might
be
named
by
thousands
of
miles
or
but
by
hundreds
though
a
great
distance
it
was
surely
yet
one
other
thing
there
was
that
has
point
in
this
place
for
when
i
sent
my
speech
out
into
the
night
using
my
brainelements
i
came
to
know
that
whether
i
had
a
knowledge
of
the
north
or
no
knowledge
at
the
moment
yet
did
i
turn
oft
with
a
sure
instinction
to
that
direction
and
of
this
the
master
monstruwacan
took
very
great
note
and
had
me
to
experiment
many
a
time
and
way
and
so
enclosed
about
with
screens
or
with
bandages
across
mine
eyes
that
i
could
not
save
by
that
inward
knowing
have
any
knowledge
to
point
me
the
way
yet
would
i
turn
northwards
very
frequent
by
a
certain
feeling
and
seemed
unable
of
speech
if
i
were
turned
otherwise
by
force
but
when
we
asked
naani
whether
she
had
an
unusualness
in
this
matter
she
could
discover
none
and
we
could
but
take
note
curiously
of
that
which
affected
my
habits
and
which
truly
i
set
to
the
attracting
of
her
spirit
for
i
had
mind
that
she
did
be
somewheres
out
that
way
in
the
darkness
of
the
world
but
yet
was
this
no
more
than
to
suppose
as
you
perceive
and
the
master
monstruwacan
wrote
a
study
of
this
matter
of
the
northwardness
of
my
turning
and
it
was
set
out
in
the
hourslips
of
the
tower
of
observation
and
so
it
came
to
be
copied
by
the
hourslips
of
the
great
cities
and
made
much
comment
and
much
calling
up
to
me
through
the
home
instruments
so
that
with
this
and
the
speech
that
went
about
concerning
my
powers
to
hear
i
was
much
in
talk
and
diversely
pleased
and
oft
angered
by
overmuch
attention
and
importunity
and
now
whilst
i
pondered
this
matter
in
all
my
spirit
and
being
how
that
i
should
some
way
come
to
naani
there
befell
a
very
terrible
thing
and
in
this
wise
must
i
tell
it
it
was
at
the
seventeenth
hour
when
all
the
millions
of
the
mighty
pyramid
slept
that
i
was
with
the
master
monstruwacan
in
the
tower
of
observation
taking
my
due
turn
and
sudden
i
heard
the
thrilling
of
the
aether
all
about
me
and
the
voice
of
naani
in
my
soul
speaking
and
i
sent
the
masterword
into
the
darkness
of
the
world
and
presently
i
heard
the
solemn
answer
beating
steadfastly
in
the
night
and
immediately
i
called
to
naani
with
my
brainelements
to
know
what
thing
troubled
her
in
her
sleep
and
her
voice
came
into
my
spirit
weak
and
far
and
faint
and
so
that
scarce
i
could
make
to
hear
the
words
yet
in
a
while
i
gathered
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
were
in
very
deadly
trouble
for
that
the
earthcurrent
had
failed
suddenly
and
mightily
and
they
had
called
her
from
her
sleep
that
she
might
listen
whether
we
answered
their
callings
by
the
instrument
but
indeed
no
calling
had
come
to
us
and
they
who
had
been
of
late
so
joyful
were
now
grown
old
with
sorrow
in
but
an
hour
or
two
for
they
feared
that
the
fresh
coming
of
the
earthcurrent
had
been
but
the
final
flicker
and
outburst
before
the
end
and
even
in
this
short
while
of
our
speech
did
it
seem
to
me
that
the
voice
of
naani
grew
further
off
from
me
and
i
felt
like
to
have
broken
my
heart
with
the
trouble
of
this
thing
and
through
all
that
remained
of
that
sleeptime
did
i
converse
with
naani
as
might
two
lovers
who
shall
presently
part
forever
and
when
the
cities
awoke
the
news
went
throughout
them
and
all
our
millions
were
in
sorrow
and
trouble
and
thus
was
it
for
maybe
a
little
month
and
in
that
time
had
the
voice
of
naani
grown
so
weak
and
faroff
that
even
i
that
had
the
nighthearing
could
scarce
make
real
its
meaning
and
every
word
was
to
me
a
treasure
and
a
touch
upon
my
soul
and
my
grief
and
trouble
before
this
certain
parting
drove
me
that
i
could
not
eat
neither
have
rest
and
this
did
the
master
monstruwacan
take
upon
him
to
chide
and
correct
for
that
if
any
were
to
help
how
should
it
be
done
if
i
that
had
the
nighthearing
and
heard
even
now
that
the
recording
instruments
were
dumb
came
to
illhealth
and
because
of
this
and
such
wisdom
as
was
mine
i
made
to
eat
and
order
my
life
that
i
might
have
my
full
powers
yet
was
this
beyond
all
my
strength
for
presently
i
knew
that
the
people
of
the
lesser
pyramid
were
threatened
by
the
monsters
that
beset
them
and
later
i
had
knowledge
from
faint
far
words
whispered
in
my
brain
that
there
had
been
a
fight
with
an
outside
force
that
had
harmed
many
in
their
minds
so
that
in
madness
they
had
opened
the
gate
and
had
run
from
the
lesser
pyramid
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
lands
about
them
and
there
had
their
physical
bodies
fallen
to
the
monsters
of
those
lands
but
of
their
souls
who
may
know
and
this
we
set
assuredly
to
the
failure
of
the
earthcurrent
which
had
robbed
them
of
all
force
and
power
so
that
in
those
few
weeks
all
life
and
joy
of
living
had
left
them
and
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
had
they
much
nor
any
great
desire
to
live
but
yet
a
new
and
mighty
fear
of
death
and
this
doth
seem
very
strange
and
as
may
be
thought
all
this
made
the
peoples
of
the
great
redoubt
think
newly
of
the
earthcurrent
that
issued
from
the
crack
beneath
the
pyramid
and
of
their
latter
end
so
that
much
was
writ
in
the
hourslips
concerning
this
matter
yet
in
the
main
to
assure
us
that
we
ourselves
might
each
be
free
from
a
disturbed
heart
though
some
went
foolishly
to
the
other
event
and
spoke
of
a
speedy
danger
to
us
likewise
as
is
ever
the
way
but
the
truth
of
our
own
case
lay
maybe
somewhere
between
and
all
the
hourslips
were
full
also
of
imaginings
of
the
terror
of
those
poor
humans
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
world
facing
that
end
which
must
come
upon
all
even
upon
our
mighty
pyramid
though
as
most
would
believe
so
far
away
in
some
future
eternity
that
we
have
no
cause
to
trouble
and
there
were
sad
poems
writ
to
the
peoples
of
that
lesser
redoubt
and
foolish
plans
set
about
to
rescue
them
but
none
to
put
them
to
effect
and
no
way
by
which
so
great
a
thing
might
be
done
and
doth
but
show
how
loosely
people
will
speak
out
of
an
oversecurity
yet
to
me
there
had
come
a
certain
knowledge
that
i
must
make
the
adventure
though
i
achieved
naught
save
mine
own
end
yet
it
were
better
to
cease
quickly
than
that
i
should
feel
as
now
i
did
feel
that
same
night
in
the
eighteenth
hour
there
was
a
great
disturbance
in
the
aether
about
the
mighty
pyramid
and
i
was
awakened
suddenly
by
the
master
monstruwacan
that
i
might
use
my
gift
of
the
nighthearing
to
hearken
for
the
throbbing
of
the
masterword
which
they
had
thought
to
come
vaguely
through
the
instruments
but
no
one
of
the
monstruwacans
was
sensitive
enough
of
soul
to
account
truly
whether
this
was
so
and
lo
as
i
sat
up
in
the
bed
there
came
the
sound
of
the
masterword
beating
in
the
night
about
the
pyramid
and
immediately
there
was
a
crying
in
the
aether
all
about
me
we
are
coming
we
are
coming
and
mine
inwards
leaped
and
sickened
me
a
moment
so
shaken
was
i
with
a
sudden
belief
for
the
message
seemed
some
ways
to
come
to
me
from
very
near
to
the
great
redoubt
as
that
they
who
sent
it
were
nigh
to
hand
and
forthwith
i
called
the
masterword
into
the
night
but
no
answer
did
there
come
for
a
while
and
then
a
faint
thrilling
of
the
aether
about
me
and
the
weak
pulse
of
the
masterword
in
the
night
sent
by
a
far
voice
strangely
distant
and
i
knew
that
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
naani
and
i
put
a
question
through
all
the
darkness
of
the
dead
world
whether
she
were
within
the
lesser
redoubt
and
safe
thus
far
and
presently
there
came
a
faint
disturbance
about
me
and
a
small
voice
in
my
soul
speaking
weakly
and
out
of
an
infinite
distance
and
i
knew
that
far
away
through
the
night
naani
spoke
feebly
with
her
brainelements
and
that
she
abode
within
the
lesser
pyramid
but
that
she
too
had
heard
that
strange
pulse
of
the
masterword
in
the
night
and
that
message
we
are
coming
we
are
coming
and
vastly
had
this
thing
disturbed
her
waking
her
within
her
sleep
so
that
she
knew
not
what
to
think
save
that
we
were
devising
some
method
to
come
to
them
but
this
i
removed
from
doubt
saying
that
she
must
not
build
on
vain
hoping
for
i
would
not
have
her
doubly
tortured
by
the
vanity
of
such
believing
and
thereafter
having
said
such
things
as
i
might
though
few
they
were
to
comfort
her
i
bade
her
gently
to
sleep
and
turned
therewith
to
the
master
monstruwacan
who
waited
in
quiet
patience
and
had
no
knowledge
of
that
which
i
had
heard
and
sent
for
his
hearing
was
but
the
normal
though
his
brain
and
heart
were
such
as
made
me
to
love
him
and
i
told
the
master
monstruwacan
many
things
as
i
put
my
clothing
about
me
how
that
there
had
indeed
been
the
calling
of
the
masterword
but
not
by
any
of
that
lesser
redoubt
but
that
to
my
belief
it
had
come
from
nigh
about
the
great
pyramid
moreover
it
was
sent
by
no
instrument
as
i
wotted
that
he
did
guess
but
as
it
seemed
to
me
by
the
brainelements
of
many
calling
in
unison
and
all
this
did
i
set
out
to
the
master
monstruwacan
and
with
something
uncertain
of
fear
and
trouble
in
my
heart
yet
with
a
blind
expectation
as
indeed
who
would
not
though
no
longer
was
i
shaken
by
that
first
thought
of
her
nearness
and
i
said
to
the
master
monstruwacan
that
we
should
go
to
the
tower
of
observation
and
search
the
night
lands
with
the
great
spyglass
and
we
did
this
and
lo
presently
we
saw
a
great
number
of
men
pass
over
the
electric
circle
that
went
about
the
pyramid
yet
they
came
not
to
us
but
went
outwards
towards
the
blackness
and
the
strange
fires
and
hideous
mysteries
of
the
night
land
and
we
ceased
from
spying
and
looked
swiftly
at
one
another
and
knew
in
our
hearts
that
some
had
left
the
mighty
pyramid
in
the
sleeptime
then
the
master
monstruwacan
sent
word
to
the
master
watchman
that
his
wardership
had
been
outraged
and
that
people
left
the
great
pyramid
in
the
sleeptime
for
this
was
against
the
law
and
none
ever
went
out
into
the
night
land
save
the
full
watch
were
posted
to
the
great
door
and
at
a
due
time
when
all
were
wakeful
for
the
opening
of
the
door
was
made
known
to
all
the
millions
of
the
great
redoubt
so
that
all
might
be
aware
and
know
that
no
foolishness
was
done
without
their
wotting
moreover
ere
any
had
power
to
leave
the
pyramid
they
must
pass
the
examination
and
be
prepared
and
some
of
this
have
i
set
out
already
and
so
stern
was
the
framing
of
the
law
that
there
were
yet
the
metal
pegs
upon
the
inner
side
of
the
great
gate
where
had
been
stretched
the
skin
of
one
who
disobeyed
and
was
flayed
and
his
hide
set
there
to
be
a
warning
in
the
early
days
yet
the
tradition
was
remembered
for
as
i
might
say
it
we
lived
very
close
about
the
place
and
memory
had
no
room
whereby
she
might
escape
now
the
master
watchman
when
he
heard
that
which
the
master
monstruwacan
had
to
tell
went
hastily
with
some
of
the
central
watch
from
the
watchdome
to
the
great
gate
and
he
found
the
men
of
the
sleeptime
watch
with
the
warder
of
the
gate
all
bound
and
stopt
in
the
mouth
so
that
none
could
make
outcry
and
he
freed
them
and
learned
that
nigh
five
hundred
young
men
from
the
upper
cities
by
the
bigness
of
their
chests
had
come
upon
them
suddenly
and
bound
them
and
escaped
into
the
night
through
the
eyegate
in
the
top
of
the
great
gate
and
the
master
watchman
was
angry
and
demanded
why
that
none
had
called
by
the
instruments
of
the
watch
house
but
lo
some
had
made
to
call
thus
and
found
them
unable
to
wake
the
recorders
which
lay
in
the
central
watchdome
for
there
had
been
tampering
now
after
this
they
made
certain
new
rules
and
laws
concerning
the
order
of
watching
and
made
tests
of
the
lesser
instruments
of
the
inward
pyramid
nightly
upon
the
coming
of
the
sleeptime
which
was
even
in
that
strange
age
by
tradition
called
the
night
as
i
have
given
hint
though
hitherto
until
the
way
of
my
story
was
known
i
have
used
a
word
for
the
sleep
hours
that
was
yet
not
of
that
time
but
somewhat
an
invention
to
make
this
history
free
from
the
confusion
of
night
and
day
when
in
truth
it
was
always
night
without
upon
the
world
yet
after
this
shall
i
keep
to
mine
use
the
luxury
of
the
true
names
of
that
time
and
yet
how
strange
is
it
that
the
truth
should
be
of
so
little
to
our
thinking
and
so
to
go
forward
with
my
telling
for
though
all
this
care
were
now
taken
it
had
no
force
until
afterward
and
at
this
moment
were
those
poor
foolish
youths
out
in
all
the
danger
of
the
night
land
and
no
way
by
which
they
might
be
succoured
or
called
back
save
that
fear
or
wisdom
should
come
to
them
quickly
that
they
cease
from
so
wild
an
attempt
for
it
was
to
make
rescue
of
those
in
that
other
unknown
pyramid
out
in
all
the
darkness
of
the
worlds
night
that
was
their
intent
as
we
had
speedy
knowledge
from
those
boon
friends
that
had
been
in
the
secret
of
their
plot
which
had
seemed
to
them
great
and
heroic
and
was
so
in
verity
but
that
neither
they
who
went
nor
they
who
stayed
had
a
true
awaredness
of
the
danger
they
had
dealing
with
being
all
naught
but
raw
and
crude
youths
yet
doubtless
with
the
makings
of
many
fine
and
great
men
among
them
and
because
some
had
thus
abetted
that
which
they
knew
to
be
against
the
law
which
was
framed
to
the
wellbeing
and
safety
of
all
there
were
certain
floggings
which
might
the
better
help
their
memories
in
the
future
as
to
the
properness
of
their
actions
and
wisdom
moreover
they
who
returned
if
any
would
be
flogged
as
seemed
proper
after
due
examination
and
though
the
news
of
their
beatings
might
help
all
others
to
hesitation
ere
they
did
foolishly
in
like
fashion
yet
was
the
principle
of
the
flogging
not
on
this
base
which
would
be
both
improper
and
unjust
but
only
that
the
one
in
question
be
corrected
to
the
best
advantage
for
his
own
wellbeing
for
it
is
not
meet
that
any
principle
of
correction
should
shape
to
the
making
of
human
signposts
of
pain
for
the
benefit
of
others
for
in
verity
this
were
to
make
one
pay
the
cost
of
manys
learning
and
each
should
owe
to
pay
only
so
much
as
shall
suffice
for
the
teaching
of
his
own
body
and
spirit
and
if
others
profit
thereby
this
is
but
accident
however
helpful
and
this
is
wisdom
and
denoteth
now
that
a
sound
principle
shall
prevent
practice
from
becoming
monstrous
yet
now
i
must
hasten
that
i
set
down
how
it
fared
with
those
five
hundred
youths
that
had
made
so
sad
an
adventure
of
their
lives
and
unprepared
souls
and
were
beyond
our
aid
to
help
them
who
might
not
so
much
as
make
any
calling
to
them
to
bid
them
to
return
for
to
do
this
would
have
been
to
tell
to
all
the
monsters
of
the
land
that
humans
were
abroad
from
the
mighty
pyramid
and
this
would
have
been
to
cause
the
monsters
to
search
the
youths
out
to
their
destruction
and
maybe
even
to
awaken
the
forces
to
work
them
some
dread
spiritual
harm
which
was
the
chief
fear
now
presently
through
all
the
cities
of
the
great
redoubt
the
news
had
gone
how
that
five
hundred
foolish
youths
had
adventured
out
into
the
despair
of
the
night
land
and
the
whole
pyramid
waked
to
life
and
the
peoples
of
the
south
came
to
the
northern
sides
for
the
great
gate
lay
in
the
northwest
side
and
the
youths
had
made
from
there
not
straightly
outwards
but
towards
the
north
and
so
were
to
be
seen
from
the
northeast
embrasures
and
from
those
within
the
northwest
wall
and
thus
in
a
while
were
they
watched
by
all
the
mighty
multitudes
of
the
great
pyramid
through
millions
of
spyglasses
for
each
human
had
a
spyingglass
as
may
be
thought
and
some
were
an
hundred
years
old
and
some
maybe
ten
thousand
and
handed
down
through
many
generations
and
some
but
newly
made
and
very
strange
but
all
those
people
had
some
instrument
by
which
they
might
spy
out
upon
the
wonder
of
the
night
land
for
so
had
it
been
ever
through
all
the
eternity
of
darkness
and
a
great
diversion
and
wonder
of
life
was
it
to
behold
the
monsters
about
their
work
and
to
know
that
they
plotted
always
to
our
destruction
yet
were
ever
foiled
and
never
did
all
that
great
and
terrible
land
grow
stale
upon
the
soul
of
any
from
birth
until
death
and
by
this
you
shall
know
the
constant
wonder
of
it
and
that
sense
of
enemies
in
the
night
about
us
which
ever
filled
the
heart
and
spirit
of
all
beholders
so
that
never
were
the
embrasures
utterly
empty
yet
many
beheld
not
the
land
from
the
embrasures
but
sat
about
the
viewtables
which
were
set
properly
in
certain
places
throughout
the
cities
and
so
beheld
the
night
land
without
undue
cranings
or
poising
of
spyglasses
though
less
plainseen
and
these
same
tables
were
some
form
of
that
which
we
of
this
age
name
camera
obscura
but
made
very
great
and
with
inventions
and
low
to
the
floor
so
that
ten
thousand
people
might
sit
about
them
in
the
raised
galleries
and
have
comfortable
sight
yet
this
attracted
not
the
young
people
save
they
were
lovers
and
then
in
truth
were
they
comfortable
seats
for
quietness
and
gentle
whisperings
yet
now
as
may
be
supposed
with
all
the
peoples
of
the
mighty
pyramid
grown
eager
to
look
towards
one
part
of
the
night
land
the
embrasures
were
hid
in
the
crowds
and
such
as
could
gain
no
view
therethrough
thronged
about
the
viewtables
and
so
was
it
in
all
the
hours
of
leisure
so
that
women
had
scarce
patience
to
attend
their
children
but
must
hasten
to
watch
again
that
lonesome
band
of
foolish
youths
making
so
blind
and
unshaped
a
trial
to
come
upon
that
unknown
lesser
redoubt
somewhere
out
in
all
the
night
of
the
world
and
in
this
wise
passed
three
days
and
nights
yet
both
in
the
sleeptime
and
the
time
of
waking
did
great
multitudes
cease
not
to
watch
so
that
many
went
hungry
for
sleep
as
in
truth
did
i
and
sometimes
we
saw
those
youths
with
plainness
but
other
times
they
were
lost
to
our
sight
in
the
utter
shadows
of
the
night
land
yet
by
the
telling
of
our
instruments
and
the
sense
of
my
hearing
there
was
no
awaredness
among
the
monsters
and
the
forces
of
evil
that
any
were
abroad
from
the
pyramid
so
that
a
little
hope
came
into
our
hearts
that
yet
there
might
be
no
tragedy
and
times
would
they
cease
from
their
way
and
sit
about
in
circles
among
the
shadows
and
the
grey
mossbushes
which
grew
hardly
here
or
there
about
and
we
knew
that
they
had
food
with
them
to
eat
for
this
could
we
see
with
plainness
as
some
odd
grim
flare
of
light
from
the
infernal
fires
struck
upon
one
or
another
strangely
and
passed
and
left
them
in
the
darkness
and
who
of
you
shall
conceive
what
was
in
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
and
the
mothers
that
bore
the
youths
and
who
never
ceased
away
from
the
northward
embrasures
but
spied
out
in
terror
and
in
tears
and
maybe
oft
with
so
good
glasses
as
did
show
them
the
very
features
and
look
upon
the
face
of
son
and
son
and
the
kin
of
the
watchers
brought
to
them
food
and
tended
them
so
that
they
had
no
need
to
cease
from
their
watching
and
beds
were
made
in
the
embrasures
rough
and
resourceful
that
they
might
sleep
quickly
a
little
yet
be
ever
ready
if
those
cruel
monsters
without
made
discovery
of
those
their
children
thrice
in
those
three
days
of
journeying
to
the
northward
did
the
youths
sleep
and
we
perceived
that
some
kept
a
watch
and
so
knew
that
there
was
a
kind
of
order
and
leadership
among
them
also
they
had
each
his
weapon
upon
his
hip
and
this
gave
to
us
a
further
plea
to
hope
and
concerning
this
same
carrying
of
weapons
i
can
but
set
out
here
that
no
healthful
male
or
female
in
all
the
mighty
pyramid
but
possessed
such
a
weapon
and
was
trained
to
it
from
childhood
so
that
a
ripe
and
extraordinary
skill
in
the
use
thereof
was
common
to
most
yet
some
breaking
of
rule
had
there
been
that
the
youths
had
each
achieved
to
be
armed
for
the
weapons
were
stored
in
every
tenth
house
of
the
cities
in
the
care
of
the
chargingmasters
and
here
i
must
make
known
that
these
weapons
did
not
shoot
but
had
a
disk
of
grey
metal
sharp
and
wonderful
that
spun
in
the
end
of
a
rod
of
grey
metal
and
were
someways
charged
by
the
earthcurrent
so
that
were
any
but
stricken
thereby
they
were
cut
in
twain
so
easy
as
aught
and
the
weapons
were
contrived
to
the
repelling
of
any
army
of
monsters
that
might
make
to
win
entrance
to
the
redoubt
and
to
the
eye
they
had
somewhat
the
look
of
strange
battleaxes
and
might
be
lengthened
by
the
pulling
out
of
the
handles
now
the
youths
made
as
i
have
told
to
the
northward
but
had
first
to
keep
a
long
way
to
the
northeast
that
they
might
come
clear
of
the
vale
of
red
fire
and
this
wise
they
journeyed
and
kept
the
vale
about
seven
miles
to
the
northwest
of
them
and
so
were
presently
beyond
the
watcher
of
the
northeast
and
going
with
a
greater
freedom
and
having
less
care
to
hide
and
this
way
it
may
be
certain
of
the
giants
wandering
perceived
them
and
went
swiftly
to
make
attack
and
destroy
them
but
some
order
went
about
among
the
youths
and
they
made
a
long
line
with
a
certain
space
between
each
because
of
the
terror
of
their
weapon
and
immediately
it
seemed
the
giants
were
upon
them
a
score
and
seven
they
were
and
seeming
to
be
haired
like
to
mighty
crabs
as
i
saw
with
the
great
spyglass
when
the
great
flares
of
far
and
mighty
fires
threw
their
fierce
light
across
the
dark
lands
and
there
was
a
very
great
and
horrid
fight
for
the
youths
broke
into
circles
about
each
of
the
giants
and
many
of
those
young
men
were
torn
in
pieces
but
they
smote
the
monsters
from
behind
and
upon
every
side
and
we
of
the
mighty
pyramid
could
behold
at
times
the
grey
strange
gleam
of
their
weapons
and
the
jether
was
stirred
about
me
by
the
passing
of
those
that
died
yet
by
reason
of
the
great
miles
their
screams
came
not
to
us
neither
heard
we
the
roars
of
the
monsters
but
into
our
hearts
even
from
that
great
distance
and
safety
there
stole
the
terror
of
those
awesome
brutes
and
in
the
great
spyglass
i
could
behold
the
great
joints
and
limbs
and
een
i
thought
the
foul
sweat
of
them
and
their
size
and
brutishness
was
like
to
that
of
odd
and
monstrous
animals
of
the
olden
world
yet
part
human
and
it
must
be
borne
to
mind
that
the
fathers
and
the
mothers
of
those
youths
beheld
all
this
dread
fight
from
the
embrasures
and
their
other
kin
likewise
watched
and
a
very
drear
sight
was
it
to
their
hearts
and
their
human
natural
feelings
and
like
to
breed
old
age
ere
its
due
then
in
a
time
the
fight
ceased
for
of
those
seven
and
twenty
giant
brutes
there
remained
none
only
that
there
cumbered
the
ground
seven
and
twenty
lumbering
hillocks
dreadful
and
grim
for
the
lesser
dead
we
could
not
see
proper
and
we
that
were
within
the
pyramid
saw
the
youths
sorted
together
by
their
leaders
all
in
the
dim
twilight
of
that
place
and
with
the
great
spyglass
i
made
a
rough
count
and
found
that
there
lived
of
them
three
hundred
and
by
this
shall
you
know
the
power
of
those
few
monstrous
things
which
had
slain
full
two
hundred
though
each
youth
was
armed
with
so
wondrous
a
weapon
and
i
set
the
word
through
the
pyramid
that
all
might
have
some
knowledge
of
the
number
that
had
died
for
it
was
better
to
know
than
to
be
in
doubt
and
no
spyglass
had
the
power
of
the
great
spyglass
after
this
fight
the
youths
spent
a
time
having
a
care
to
their
bodies
and
wounds
and
some
were
made
separate
from
the
others
and
of
these
i
counted
upon
fifty
and
whilst
the
others
made
to
continue
their
march
towards
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
these
were
constrained
by
one
who
was
the
leader
to
return
to
the
pyramid
and
in
a
little
i
saw
that
they
came
towards
us
wearily
and
with
many
a
halt
as
that
they
suffered
great
wounds
and
harm
of
the
fight
but
those
others
maybe
two
hundred
and
fifty
youths
went
onwards
into
the
night
land
and
though
we
sorrowed
at
this
thing
yet
was
there
come
a
huge
pride
into
our
hearts
that
those
raw
ones
who
yesterday
were
but
children
had
so
held
themselves
in
the
battle
and
done
a
great
deed
that
day
and
i
wot
that
whilst
their
mothers
wept
easeless
their
fathers
hearts
swelled
within
them
and
held
somewhat
of
their
pain
away
from
them
for
a
time
and
all
this
while
those
wounded
youths
came
slowly
and
rested
and
came
on
again
the
better
helping
the
worse
and
a
great
excitement
and
trouble
there
was
in
all
the
mighty
pyramid
to
learn
which
were
they
that
came
and
they
that
went
and
who
lay
out
there
quietly
among
the
slain
but
none
might
say
anything
with
surety
for
even
with
that
great
spyglass
in
the
tower
of
observation
they
were
not
overplain
save
when
some
light
from
the
fires
of
the
land
flared
high
and
lit
them
for
they
stood
not
up
into
the
glare
of
the
fires
as
had
the
giants
and
though
i
saw
them
with
clearness
yet
i
knew
them
not
for
there
was
so
mighty
a
multitude
in
that
vast
redoubt
that
none
might
ever
know
the
half
even
of
their
rulers
and
about
this
time
there
came
a
fresh
matter
of
trouble
to
our
minds
for
one
of
the
monstruwacans
made
report
that
the
instruments
were
recording
an
influence
abroad
in
the
night
so
that
we
had
knowledge
that
one
of
the
evil
forces
was
out
and
to
me
there
came
an
awaredness
that
a
strange
unquiet
stole
over
the
land
yet
i
knew
it
not
with
mine
ears
but
my
spirit
heard
and
it
was
as
though
trouble
and
an
expectation
of
horror
did
swarm
about
me
and
once
listening
i
heard
the
masterword
beating
strangely
low
and
i
knew
the
aether
to
thrill
about
me
and
a
faint
stirring
was
there
in
my
soul
as
of
a
faint
voice
speaking
and
i
knew
that
naani
called
to
me
some
message
across
the
night
of
the
world
yet
weak
and
coming
without
clear
meaning
so
that
i
was
tormented
and
could
but
send
comfort
to
her
with
my
brainelements
and
presently
i
knew
that
she
ceased
to
speak
and
later
i
heard
that
there
was
a
new
matter
forward
in
the
redoubt
for
ten
thousand
men
had
assembled
to
attend
the
room
of
preparation
for
the
short
preparation
and
by
this
we
knew
that
those
poor
youths
who
stumbled
towards
us
through
the
dark
were
presently
to
have
help
and
through
all
that
sleeptime
there
went
forward
the
spiritual
and
the
physical
preparation
of
the
ten
thousand
and
upon
the
morrow
they
slept
whilst
an
hundred
thousand
made
ready
their
arms
and
in
this
space
of
time
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
youths
that
went
towards
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
had
come
very
nigh
thereto
having
gone
very
warily
and
with
some
slowness
because
as
may
be
of
the
lesson
of
the
giants
and
to
us
in
the
pyramid
the
instruments
made
known
constantly
that
influence
which
was
abroad
and
which
all
those
of
the
tower
of
observation
thought
to
proceed
from
the
house
of
silence
yet
nothing
could
we
see
with
the
great
spyglass
and
so
could
come
to
no
sure
knowing
but
only
to
fear
and
wonder
and
presently
the
youths
were
upon
the
great
road
and
turned
to
the
northward
and
beyond
them
a
great
way
stood
the
house
of
silence
upon
a
low
hill
at
a
certain
distance
to
the
right
of
the
road
by
now
they
that
were
wounded
had
come
to
within
maybe
fifteen
miles
of
the
great
redoubt
and
the
news
went
through
all
the
cities
that
the
ten
thousand
men
that
were
prepared
made
to
arm
themselves
and
i
went
down
by
the
tower
lift
and
saw
them
come
down
by
thousands
from
the
room
of
preparation
and
none
might
go
nigh
to
them
or
cause
them
to
speak
for
they
were
made
ready
and
were
as
it
might
be
holy
and
all
the
millions
of
the
mighty
pyramid
stood
in
their
cities
about
certain
of
the
main
lifts
and
watched
those
thousands
go
downwards
all
in
their
armour
of
grey
metal
and
each
one
armed
with
the
diskos
which
was
that
same
very
terrible
weapon
which
all
had
training
to
and
i
doubt
not
but
that
the
young
men
of
the
pyramid
looked
with
longing
in
their
hearts
that
they
might
have
been
among
those
that
went
forth
to
succour
yet
the
older
men
had
graver
thoughts
in
their
hearts
for
the
blood
ran
more
soberly
in
them
and
they
had
knowledge
and
memory
of
the
peril
and
by
this
i
would
make
clear
that
i
speak
less
of
the
peril
of
the
body
which
is
common
to
every
state
of
life
but
of
the
peril
of
the
spirit
and
it
may
be
thought
by
those
of
this
age
that
it
was
most
strange
that
they
of
that
having
all
the
knowledge
of
eternity
to
aid
them
had
no
weapon
by
which
to
shoot
and
kill
at
a
distance
but
indeed
this
had
not
been
so
in
the
past
as
our
histories
did
show
for
some
wondrous
weapons
there
had
been
that
might
slay
without
sound
or
flash
at
a
full
score
miles
and
more
and
some
we
had
whole
within
the
great
museum
and
of
others
but
the
parts
in
decay
for
they
had
been
foolish
things
and
reckless
to
use
for
we
of
that
great
pyramid
wanted
not
to
kill
a
few
of
the
monsters
that
lay
at
a
great
distance
but
only
those
which
came
nigh
to
harm
us
and
concerning
those
same
weapons
that
killed
silently
at
a
great
distance
we
had
now
little
knowledge
save
that
they
did
waste
the
earthcurrent
and
no
practice
had
we
concerning
their
workings
for
it
was
maybe
an
hundred
thousand
years
gone
that
they
had
been
used
and
found
to
be
of
no
great
worth
in
a
close
attack
and
harmful
otherwise
to
the
peace
in
that
they
angered
unneedful
the
forces
of
that
land
slaying
wantonly
those
monsters
which
did
no
more
than
beset
the
mighty
redoubt
at
a
great
distance
for
as
may
be
seen
by
a
little
thought
we
did
very
gladly
keep
a
reasonable
quietness
and
refrained
from
aught
that
should
wake
that
land
for
we
were
born
to
the
custom
of
that
strange
life
and
lived
and
died
in
peace
for
the
most
part
and
were
very
content
to
have
security
and
to
be
neutral
in
all
things
that
did
not
overbear
us
but
as
it
were
always
armed
and
ready
but
concerning
the
great
and
evil
forces
that
were
abroad
in
the
night
land
these
we
had
no
power
to
harm
nor
could
we
hope
for
more
than
that
we
had
security
from
them
which
indeed
we
had
but
the
hugeness
of
their
power
was
about
us
and
we
dared
not
to
wake
it
save
through
such
extremity
as
had
come
to
pass
by
this
folly
of
the
youths
though
even
now
we
had
no
thought
to
attack
aught
but
only
to
succour
those
wounded
ones
and
concerning
this
simplicity
of
weapons
which
excites
somewhat
even
my
wonder
in
this
our
present
age
it
may
be
that
the
powers
of
chemistry
were
someways
quaintly
limited
by
conditions
in
that
age
and
there
to
be
always
a
need
to
spare
the
earthcurrent
and
hence
by
this
cause
and
by
that
we
were
brought
by
the
extreme
nigh
to
the
simplicity
of
the
early
world
yet
with
a
strange
and
mighty
difference
as
all
may
know
who
have
read
now
presently
the
word
was
sent
to
every
city
throughout
the
great
redoubtas
was
the
lawthat
the
great
gate
should
be
opened
and
each
city
sent
its
master
to
form
the
full
watch
as
was
the
law
and
each
went
clad
in
grey
armour
and
carrying
the
diskos
and
the
full
watch
numbered
two
thousand
for
there
were
also
the
watchmen
then
the
lights
in
the
great
causeway
were
made
dim
so
that
the
opening
of
the
gate
should
cast
no
great
glare
from
within
into
the
night
land
to
tell
the
watcher
of
the
northwest
and
all
the
monsters
that
certain
humans
went
out
from
the
mighty
pyramid
but
whether
the
vast
and
hidden
forces
of
evil
had
knowledge
we
knew
not
and
they
who
went
must
but
chance
it
remembering
that
they
were
prepared
and
had
the
capsule
and
the
ten
thousand
that
were
prepared
went
out
through
the
great
gateway
into
the
night
and
the
full
watch
stood
back
from
them
and
spoke
no
word
but
saluted
silently
with
the
diskos
and
they
that
went
raised
each
the
diskos
a
little
and
passed
out
into
the
dark
then
the
great
gate
was
shut
and
we
made
to
wait
and
to
watch
with
trouble
and
expectation
within
our
hearts
and
at
the
embrasures
many
did
comfort
the
women
of
those
men
and
i
went
back
upwards
by
miles
until
i
came
to
the
tower
of
observation
and
i
looked
out
from
there
into
the
night
land
and
saw
that
the
ten
thousand
halted
at
the
circle
and
made
arrangement
of
themselves
and
sent
some
before
and
upon
either
hand
and
so
went
forward
into
the
night
land
and
after
that
i
went
to
the
great
spyglass
and
turned
it
towards
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
youths
that
were
far
off
upon
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
yet
for
awhile
i
could
not
perceive
them
for
all
the
road
seemed
empty
but
afterward
i
saw
them
and
they
were
clambering
back
into
the
road
having
gone
aside
as
i
thought
because
of
the
passing
of
one
of
those
silent
ones
that
i
saw
now
at
a
distance
to
the
southward
of
them
there
passed
then
some
three
hours
and
in
that
time
i
varied
my
watching
between
those
faroff
youths
and
the
tenthousand
that
went
forward
to
succour
the
wounded
that
were
now
maybe
scarce
nine
miles
distant
from
the
mighty
pyramid
and
the
tenthousand
came
very
close
to
them
and
in
truth
in
a
little
while
they
spied
one
the
other
and
i
gathered
in
spirit
something
of
the
rejoicing
of
those
youths
yet
weak
and
troubled
were
they
because
of
their
wounds
and
their
knowledge
of
failure
and
their
disobedience
of
the
law
and
presently
they
were
surrounded
by
the
tenthousand
and
carried
upon
slings
and
all
that
body
swung
round
towards
the
pyramid
and
came
back
at
a
great
pace
and
in
the
same
time
i
heard
the
sound
that
made
them
so
swift
to
hasten
for
there
smote
up
through
the
night
the
baying
of
the
hounds
and
we
knew
that
they
were
discovered
and
i
swept
the
great
spyglass
over
the
land
towards
the
valley
of
the
hounds
that
i
might
discover
them
quickly
and
i
saw
them
come
lumbering
at
a
strange
gallop
and
great
as
horses
and
it
might
be
only
ten
miles
to
the
east
and
i
looked
once
upon
the
watcher
of
the
northeast
and
i
saw
and
marvelled
that
the
great
bellear
quivered
constantly
and
i
knew
that
it
had
knowledge
and
gave
signal
to
all
the
land
then
did
one
of
the
monstruwacans
report
that
a
new
and
terrible
influence
was
abroad
in
the
land
and
by
the
instrument
we
had
knowledge
that
it
approached
and
some
of
the
monstruwacans
called
foolishly
with
weak
voices
to
the
tenthousand
to
haste
forgetting
and
desiring
only
their
safety
from
that
which
came
near
then
looking
with
the
great
spyglass
i
saw
that
there
moved
across
the
land
from
the
direction
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
a
mighty
hump
seeming
of
black
mist
and
came
with
prodigious
swiftness
and
i
called
to
the
master
monstruwacan
that
he
come
and
look
through
one
of
the
eyepieces
that
were
about
the
great
spyglass
and
he
came
quickly
and
when
he
had
looked
a
while
he
called
to
the
monstruwacan
that
had
made
report
and
the
monstruwacan
answered
and
replied
that
the
influence
drew
nearer
by
the
reading
of
the
instrument
yet
of
the
thing
itself
the
man
had
no
sight
and
i
ceased
not
to
look
and
in
a
little
while
the
humped
thing
passed
downwards
into
the
vale
of
red
fire
which
lay
across
the
land
that
way
but
i
watched
steadfastly
and
presently
i
saw
the
black
hump
climb
up
from
the
vale
of
red
fire
upon
this
side
and
come
through
the
night
so
that
in
scarce
a
minute
it
had
come
halfway
across
that
part
of
the
night
land
and
my
heart
stood
quiet
with
fear
and
the
utter
terror
of
this
monster
which
i
knew
to
be
surely
one
of
the
great
forces
of
evil
of
that
land
and
had
power
without
doubt
to
destroy
the
spirit
and
the
master
monstruwacan
leapt
towards
the
homecall
and
sent
the
great
sound
down
to
the
tenthousand
that
they
might
attend
and
immediately
he
signalled
to
them
to
beware
yet
already
i
perceived
that
they
knew
of
this
utter
danger
that
was
upon
them
for
i
saw
them
slay
the
youths
quickly
that
their
spirits
might
not
be
lost
for
they
were
unprepared
but
the
men
being
prepared
had
the
capsule
and
would
die
swiftly
in
the
last
moment
i
looked
again
towards
the
hump
and
saw
that
it
came
like
a
hill
of
blackness
in
the
land
and
was
almost
anigh
then
there
happened
a
wonder
for
in
that
moment
when
all
had
else
gone
quickly
that
they
might
save
their
souls
out
of
the
earth
there
rose
a
little
light
like
to
the
crescent
of
the
young
moon
of
this
early
day
and
the
crescent
rose
up
into
an
arch
of
bright
and
cold
fire
glowing
but
little
and
it
spanned
above
the
tenthousand
and
the
dead
and
the
hump
stood
still
and
went
backwards
and
was
presently
lost
and
the
men
came
swiftly
towards
the
mighty
pyramid
yet
ere
they
were
come
to
safety
the
baying
of
the
hounds
sounded
close
upon
them
and
they
faced
to
the
danger
yet
as
i
could
know
without
despair
because
that
they
yet
lived
after
so
enormous
a
peril
and
the
hounds
were
very
nigh
as
now
i
beheld
with
the
great
spyglass
and
i
counted
five
score
running
with
mighty
heads
low
and
in
a
pack
and
lo
as
the
hounds
came
at
them
the
tenthousand
drew
apart
and
had
a
space
between
the
men
that
they
might
have
full
use
of
that
terrible
diskos
and
they
fought
with
the
handles
at
length
and
i
saw
the
disks
spin
and
glisten
and
send
out
fire
then
was
there
a
very
great
battle
for
the
light
that
arched
above
them
and
held
away
the
power
from
their
souls
made
not
to
protect
them
from
this
danger
of
the
lesser
monsters
and
at
an
hundred
thousand
embrasures
within
the
mighty
pyramid
the
women
cried
and
sobbed
and
looked
again
and
in
the
lower
cities
it
was
told
after
that
the
peoples
could
hear
the
crash
and
splinter
of
the
armour
as
the
hounds
ran
to
and
fro
slaying
aye
even
the
sound
of
the
armour
between
their
teeth
yet
the
tenthousand
ceased
not
to
smite
with
the
diskos
and
they
hewed
the
hounds
in
pieces
but
of
the
men
that
went
forth
there
were
a
thousand
and
seven
hundred
slain
by
the
hounds
ere
the
men
won
to
victory
then
came
that
wearied
band
of
heroes
back
to
the
home
shelter
of
the
vast
redoubt
and
they
bore
their
dead
with
them
and
the
youths
that
they
slew
and
they
were
received
with
great
honour
and
with
exceeding
grief
and
in
a
great
silence
for
the
thing
admitted
not
of
words
until
a
time
had
passed
and
in
the
cities
of
the
pyramid
there
was
mourning
for
there
had
been
no
sorrow
like
unto
this
through
mayhap
an
hundred
thousand
years
and
they
bore
the
youths
to
their
mothers
and
to
their
fathers
and
the
father
of
each
made
thanks
to
the
men
that
they
had
saved
the
soul
of
his
son
but
the
women
were
silent
yet
neither
to
the
father
nor
to
the
mother
was
ever
made
known
the
name
of
the
slayers
for
this
might
not
be
as
all
shall
see
with
a
little
thought
and
some
did
remember
that
in
verity
all
was
due
to
the
unwisdom
of
those
youths
who
had
heeded
not
the
law
and
their
lifeteachings
yet
had
they
paid
to
the
uttermost
and
passed
outwards
and
the
account
of
their
deeds
was
closed
and
all
this
while
did
great
numbers
spy
toward
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
that
they
might
watch
that
band
of
youths
afar
in
the
night
land
who
went
forward
amid
those
horrid
dangers
yet
when
the
dead
youths
had
been
brought
in
many
had
ceased
to
look
out
for
a
time
and
had
turned
to
questioning
and
some
had
made
inspection
that
they
might
know
which
had
come
back
and
which
lay
out
there
where
the
giants
had
slain
them
or
went
forward
to
more
dreadful
matters
but
who
of
those
that
were
abroad
were
slain
or
still
went
onward
we
had
but
indifferent
knowledge
though
the
men
of
the
tenthousand
knew
somewhat
having
had
speech
with
the
wounded
youths
ere
they
slew
them
and
as
may
be
thought
these
men
were
sorely
questioned
by
the
mothers
and
the
fathers
of
those
youths
that
were
not
accounted
of
yet
i
doubt
that
few
had
much
knowledge
wherewith
to
console
them
now
there
was
presently
in
the
garden
of
silence
which
was
the
lowermost
of
all
the
underground
fields
the
ending
of
those
seventeen
hundred
heroes
and
of
the
youths
that
they
saved
and
slew
and
the
garden
was
a
great
country
and
an
hundred
miles
every
way
and
the
roof
thereof
was
three
great
miles
above
and
shaped
to
a
mighty
dome
as
it
had
been
that
the
builders
and
makers
thereof
did
remember
in
their
spirits
the
visible
sky
of
this
our
present
age
and
the
making
of
that
country
was
all
set
out
in
a
single
history
of
seven
thousand
and
seventy
volumes
and
there
were
likewise
seven
thousand
and
seventy
years
spent
to
the
making
of
that
country
so
that
there
had
unremembered
generations
lived
and
laboured
and
died
and
seen
not
the
end
of
their
labour
and
love
had
shaped
it
and
hallowed
it
so
that
of
all
the
wonders
of
the
world
there
has
been
none
that
shall
ever
come
anigh
to
that
country
of
silencean
hundred
miles
every
way
of
silence
to
the
dead
and
there
were
in
that
roof
seven
moons
set
in
a
mighty
circle
and
lit
by
the
earthcurrent
and
the
circle
was
sixty
miles
across
so
that
all
that
country
of
quiet
was
visible
yet
to
no
great
glare
but
a
sweet
and
holy
light
so
that
i
did
always
feel
in
my
heart
that
a
man
might
weep
there
and
be
unashamed
and
in
the
midst
of
that
silent
country
there
was
a
great
hill
and
upon
the
hill
a
vast
dome
and
the
dome
was
full
of
a
light
that
might
be
seen
in
all
that
country
which
was
the
garden
of
silence
and
beneath
the
dome
was
the
crack
and
within
it
the
glory
of
the
earthcurrent
from
which
all
had
life
and
light
and
safety
and
in
the
dome
at
the
north
there
was
a
gateway
and
a
narrow
road
went
upward
to
the
gateway
and
the
road
was
named
the
last
road
and
the
gateway
was
named
by
no
name
but
known
to
all
as
the
gateway
and
there
were
in
that
mighty
country
long
roadways
and
hidden
methods
to
help
travel
and
constant
temples
of
rest
along
the
miles
and
groves
and
the
charm
of
water
falling
and
everywhere
the
statues
of
memory
and
the
tablets
of
memory
and
the
whole
of
that
great
underground
country
full
of
an
echo
of
eternity
and
of
memory
and
love
and
greatness
so
that
to
walk
alone
in
that
land
was
to
grow
back
to
the
wonder
and
mystery
of
childhood
and
presently
to
go
upwards
again
to
the
cities
of
the
mighty
pyramid
purified
and
sweetened
of
soul
and
mind
and
in
my
boyhood
i
have
wandered
oft
a
week
of
days
in
that
country
of
silence
and
had
my
food
with
me
and
slept
quietly
amid
the
memories
and
gone
on
again
wrapped
about
with
the
quiet
of
the
everlasting
and
the
mansoul
within
would
be
drawn
mightily
to
those
places
where
the
great
ones
of
the
past
eternity
of
the
world
had
their
memory
named
but
there
was
that
within
me
which
ever
drew
me
in
the
ending
to
the
hills
of
the
babes
those
little
hills
where
might
be
heard
amid
the
lonesomeness
of
an
utter
quiet
a
strange
and
wondrous
echo
as
of
a
little
child
calling
over
the
hills
but
how
this
was
i
know
not
save
by
the
sweet
cunning
of
some
dead
maker
in
the
forgotten
years
and
here
mayhaps
by
reason
of
this
voice
of
pathos
were
to
be
found
the
countless
tokens
of
memory
to
all
the
babes
of
the
mighty
pyramid
through
a
thousand
ages
and
odd
whiles
would
i
come
upon
some
mother
sitting
there
lonely
or
mayhaps
companied
by
others
and
by
this
little
telling
shall
you
know
somewhat
of
the
quietness
and
the
wonder
and
the
holiness
of
that
great
country
hallowed
to
all
memory
and
to
eternity
and
to
our
dead
and
it
was
here
into
the
country
of
silence
that
they
brought
down
the
dead
to
their
burial
and
there
came
down
into
the
country
of
silence
maybe
an
hundred
million
out
of
the
cities
of
the
pyramid
to
be
present
and
to
do
honour
now
they
that
had
charge
of
the
dead
did
lay
them
upon
the
road
which
ran
up
unto
the
gateway
even
that
same
road
which
was
named
the
last
road
and
the
road
moved
upwards
slowly
with
the
dead
and
the
dead
went
inward
through
the
gateway
first
the
poor
youths
and
afterward
they
that
had
given
up
life
that
they
might
save
them
and
as
the
dead
went
upwards
there
was
a
very
great
silence
over
all
the
miles
of
the
country
of
silence
but
in
a
little
while
there
came
from
afar
off
a
sound
as
of
a
wind
wailing
and
it
came
onwards
out
of
the
distance
and
passed
over
the
hills
of
the
babes
which
were
a
great
way
off
and
so
came
anigh
to
the
place
where
i
stood
even
as
the
blowing
of
a
sorrowful
wind
did
it
come
and
i
knew
that
all
the
great
multitudes
did
sing
quietly
and
the
singing
passed
onwards
and
left
behind
it
an
utter
silence
even
as
the
wind
doth
rustle
the
corn
and
pass
onwards
and
all
fall
to
a
greater
seeming
quietness
than
before
and
the
dead
passed
inward
through
the
gateway
into
the
great
light
and
silence
of
the
dome
and
came
out
no
more
and
again
from
beyond
the
far
hills
of
the
babes
there
was
that
sound
of
the
millions
singing
and
there
rose
up
out
of
the
earth
beneath
the
voices
of
the
underground
organs
and
the
noise
of
the
sorrow
passed
over
me
and
went
again
into
the
distance
and
left
all
hushed
and
lo
as
there
passed
inward
to
the
silence
of
the
dome
the
last
of
those
dead
heroes
there
came
again
the
sound
from
beyond
the
hills
of
the
babes
and
as
it
came
more
nigh
i
knew
that
it
was
the
song
of
honour
loud
and
triumphant
and
sung
by
countless
multitudes
and
the
voices
of
the
organs
rose
up
into
thunder
from
the
deep
earth
and
there
was
a
great
honour
done
to
the
glory
of
the
dead
and
afterwards
once
more
a
silence
then
did
the
peoples
of
the
cities
arrange
themselves
so
that
from
every
city
whence
had
come
a
hero
were
the
people
of
that
city
gathered
together
and
when
they
were
so
gathered
they
set
up
tokens
of
memory
to
the
dead
of
their
city
but
afterwards
did
charge
artists
to
the
making
of
sculpture
great
and
beautiful
to
that
same
end
and
now
did
but
place
tablets
against
that
time
and
afterwards
the
people
did
wander
over
that
country
of
silence
and
made
visit
and
honour
to
their
ancestors
if
such
were
deserving
and
presently
the
mighty
lifts
did
raise
them
all
to
the
cities
of
the
pyramid
and
thereafter
there
was
something
more
of
usualness
save
that
ever
the
embrasures
were
full
of
those
that
watched
the
youths
afar
upon
the
great
road
and
in
this
place
i
to
remember
how
that
our
spyglasses
had
surely
some
power
of
the
earthcurrent
to
make
greater
the
impulse
of
the
light
upon
the
eye
and
they
were
like
no
spyglass
that
ever
you
did
see
but
oddly
shaped
and
to
touch
both
the
forehead
and
the
eyes
and
gave
wonderful
sight
of
the
land
but
the
great
spyglass
to
be
beyond
all
this
for
it
had
the
eyes
of
it
upon
every
side
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
did
be
truly
an
huge
machine
and
to
me
as
i
went
about
my
duties
or
peered
forth
through
the
great
spyglass
at
the
youths
upon
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
there
came
at
times
a
far
faint
thrilling
of
the
aether
so
that
sometimes
i
was
aware
that
there
was
the
beating
of
the
masterword
in
the
night
but
so
strange
and
weak
that
the
instruments
had
no
wotting
of
it
and
when
this
came
then
would
i
call
back
through
all
the
everlasting
night
to
naani
who
was
indeed
mirdath
and
i
would
send
the
masterword
with
my
brainelements
and
afterwards
such
comfort
as
i
might
yet
hard
and
bitter
was
the
truth
of
my
helplessness
and
weakness
and
the
utter
terror
and
might
of
the
evil
forces
and
monsters
of
the
night
land
so
that
i
was
like
to
have
brake
my
heart
with
pondering
and
the
silence
would
come
again
and
anon
the
weak
thrilling
of
the
aether
but
no
more
the
far
voice
speaking
in
my
soul
v
into
the
night
land
now
after
that
destruction
which
had
come
upon
the
tenthousand
and
the
fresh
assurance
that
was
upon
us
of
the
terror
of
the
night
land
it
may
be
known
that
there
could
be
no
more
thought
to
succour
though
in
truth
those
youths
that
went
now
upon
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
were
far
beyond
our
aid
yet
might
it
be
thought
that
we
should
have
signalled
to
them
calling
by
the
homecall
which
was
that
great
voice
which
went
forth
from
the
machine
above
the
sealed
base
of
the
mighty
pyramid
but
this
we
might
not
do
for
then
we
gave
signal
to
the
monsters
of
that
land
that
some
were
even
now
abroad
from
the
pyramid
yet
we
could
no
more
than
hope
that
the
evil
forces
had
no
wotting
of
them
for
in
verity
none
might
ever
know
the
knowledge
or
the
ignorance
which
those
powers
did
possess
yet
it
must
be
kept
to
the
mind
that
we
knew
even
then
there
was
an
influence
abroad
in
the
land
strange
and
quiet
so
that
the
instruments
did
not
more
than
make
record
of
it
and
as
i
have
surely
set
down
ere
now
we
had
belief
that
it
did
come
from
that
house
of
silence
afar
in
the
night
land
upon
that
low
hill
to
the
north
of
the
great
road
and
many
among
the
monstruwacans
feared
that
it
was
directed
upon
the
youths
but
of
this
there
could
be
no
surety
and
we
could
but
wait
and
watch
now
about
this
time
those
poor
youths
did
draw
nigh
to
that
part
of
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
where
it
turned
more
swiftly
to
the
north
and
they
to
be
now
at
no
mighty
distance
from
that
grim
and
horrid
house
and
presently
we
knew
that
the
influence
had
a
greater
power
in
the
land
and
i
had
an
assuredness
that
it
came
from
the
house
yet
no
certain
proof
was
this
but
i
set
out
my
feelings
to
the
master
monstruwacan
and
he
had
trust
in
them
and
in
my
power
moreover
he
also
had
belief
within
himself
that
some
secret
power
came
out
from
the
house
of
silence
and
some
talk
there
was
at
times
that
we
send
the
homecall
into
the
night
to
give
warning
to
the
youths
of
our
knowledge
and
our
fear
and
to
entreat
them
to
make
a
safe
endeavour
to
return
swiftly
yet
was
this
an
error
and
refused
by
the
master
monstruwacan
for
it
was
not
meet
that
we
put
the
souls
of
those
youths
in
peril
until
such
time
as
we
had
certainty
that
they
should
be
lost
if
we
did
not
bestir
ourselves
for
indeed
this
homecall
was
as
a
mighty
voice
calling
over
the
world
and
did
have
so
exceeding
a
noise
that
it
had
immediately
told
all
that
land
how
that
some
were
yet
abroad
from
the
great
redoubt
and
here
will
i
set
down
how
that
the
homecall
had
no
use
in
those
ages
but
had
been
a
call
in
the
olden
time
when
yet
the
great
flyingships
went
abroad
over
the
world
and
there
passed
now
a
day
and
a
night
and
in
all
that
time
there
ceased
not
great
multitudes
to
peer
forth
into
the
night
land
at
the
youths
for
it
was
known
concerning
the
influence
and
all
felt
that
the
youths
did
draw
nigh
very
speedy
to
their
fate
and
much
talk
there
was
and
many
things
said
and
much
foolish
speech
and
kind
intent
but
no
courage
to
go
forth
to
make
further
attempt
to
rescue
which
in
truth
calls
not
for
great
astonishment
as
i
have
surely
writ
or
oft
thought
and
in
this
place
let
me
set
down
that
the
land
was
as
it
might
be
said
waked
and
unquiet
and
a
sense
of
things
passing
in
the
night
and
of
horrid
watchfulness
and
there
were
at
this
time
and
at
that
low
roars
that
went
across
the
land
and
if
i
have
not
told
the
same
before
this
time
it
must
be
set
to
count
against
me
and
my
telling
for
indeed
i
should
have
writ
it
down
before
this
place
yet
is
the
difficulty
of
my
task
great
and
all
must
bear
with
me
and
entreat
for
me
that
i
have
courage
so
that
i
may
come
at
last
to
strength
and
wisdom
to
tell
all
that
i
did
see
now
in
the
space
of
this
day
and
night
it
was
known
that
the
youths
had
not
slept
neither
had
they
eaten
save
once
as
they
who
had
the
watch
through
the
great
spyglass
did
affirm
but
they
to
hasten
alway
at
a
woeful
speed
towards
the
north
along
that
great
dismal
road
so
that
presently
they
must
cease
or
slay
themselves
with
their
endeavour
and
all
this
did
give
surety
to
our
fears
that
they
were
under
a
spell
from
that
horrid
house
afar
in
the
land
and
we
had
an
assurance
that
this
thing
was
for
presently
there
came
a
monstruwacan
to
the
master
monstruwacan
to
report
that
there
had
come
sudden
a
mighty
influence
into
the
land
and
in
the
same
moment
as
it
might
be
i
spied
through
the
great
spyglass
and
did
see
those
youths
break
swiftly
from
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
and
begin
to
run
very
swift
that
they
might
come
quickly
to
the
house
of
silence
then
did
the
master
monstruwacan
hesitate
not
but
did
send
the
homecall
across
the
world
aye
even
to
those
poor
doomed
ones
that
hastened
unknowing
to
the
terror
which
did
compel
them
and
immediately
upon
the
sound
the
master
did
send
a
message
to
the
natural
eye
in
set
language
and
made
warning
that
they
suffered
themselves
to
be
drawn
to
their
destruction
by
a
force
that
came
from
within
the
house
of
silence
and
he
besought
them
to
put
forth
the
strength
of
their
spirits
and
do
battle
for
their
souls
and
if
they
could
in
no
wise
compass
a
victory
over
that
which
drew
them
onwards
to
slay
themselves
quickly
ere
they
went
into
that
house
to
the
horror
of
utter
destruction
and
in
all
the
pyramid
was
there
a
great
silence
for
the
bellowing
of
the
homecall
bred
a
quietness
because
of
that
which
it
did
portend
and
it
was
swiftly
known
by
the
millions
that
the
master
monstruwacan
did
plead
for
the
souls
of
the
youths
and
there
went
forth
unknowingly
a
counterforce
from
the
mighty
pyramid
by
reason
of
the
prayers
and
soulwishings
of
the
countless
millions
and
the
counterforce
was
plain
to
my
inward
hearing
and
beat
all
the
aether
of
the
world
into
a
surge
of
supplication
so
that
it
stunned
my
spirit
with
the
great
power
of
it
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
it
were
that
there
was
a
vast
spiritualnoise
in
all
the
night
and
i
spied
tremblingly
through
the
great
spyglass
and
lo
the
youths
did
cease
from
their
swift
running
and
were
come
together
in
a
crowd
and
had
a
seeming
to
be
confused
as
might
some
who
have
waked
suddenly
from
sleep
to
find
that
they
walked
in
their
sleep
and
had
come
to
a
strange
place
then
came
there
a
great
roar
from
all
the
millions
that
spied
from
the
embrasuresfrom
nigh
five
hundred
thousand
embrasures
they
did
look
and
i
count
not
the
great
viewtables
and
the
shouting
rose
up
like
to
the
roaring
of
a
mighty
wind
of
triumph
yet
was
it
overearly
to
sound
for
victory
for
the
counterforce
which
came
from
the
intensity
of
so
many
wills
blent
to
one
intent
was
brake
and
the
evil
force
which
came
forth
out
of
the
house
did
draw
the
youths
again
so
that
they
heeded
not
their
salvation
but
turned
once
again
to
their
running
and
the
mighty
pyramid
was
full
of
a
shaken
silence
and
immediately
of
lamentation
and
sorrow
and
horror
at
this
thing
but
in
that
moment
there
did
happen
a
fresh
wonder
for
there
grew
suddenly
before
those
poor
youths
billows
of
mistas
it
had
been
of
pure
white
fire
shining
very
chill
yet
giving
no
light
upon
them
and
the
mist
of
cold
fire
stayed
their
way
so
that
we
had
knowledge
that
there
fought
for
the
souls
of
them
one
of
those
sweet
powers
of
goodness
which
we
had
belief
did
strive
to
ward
our
spirits
at
all
times
from
those
forces
of
evil
and
destruction
and
all
the
millions
saw
the
thing
but
some
with
a
great
clearness
and
many
doubtful
yet
were
all
advanced
more
in
spiritual
sight
and
hearing
than
the
normal
peoples
of
this
age
but
of
them
all
none
had
the
nighthearing
to
know
a
soul
having
speech
in
the
aether
half
across
the
world
yet
as
i
have
said
some
there
had
been
aforetime
who
were
thus
given
the
hearing
even
as
was
i
and
there
came
a
monstruwacan
to
the
master
monstruwacan
to
make
report
that
the
influence
had
ceased
to
work
upon
the
instruments
and
by
this
thing
we
knew
that
in
verity
the
force
which
proceeded
out
from
the
house
of
silence
was
cut
off
from
us
and
from
those
youths
and
we
had
assurance
that
there
fought
a
very
mighty
power
for
the
salvation
of
the
souls
of
the
youths
and
all
the
peoples
were
silent
save
for
an
underbreath
of
wonder
and
talk
for
all
were
utter
stirred
with
hope
and
fear
perceiving
that
the
youths
had
some
chance
given
unto
them
to
return
and
whilst
the
youths
yet
wavered
in
their
minds
as
i
perceived
with
the
great
spyglass
and
the
knowledge
of
my
soul
and
of
my
natural
wit
lo
the
master
monstruwacan
sent
once
more
the
great
voice
of
the
homecall
abroad
into
the
land
and
immediately
besought
those
youths
for
the
sake
of
their
souls
and
the
love
which
their
mothers
had
for
them
to
come
swiftly
homewards
whilst
they
had
yet
this
great
power
to
shield
them
and
allow
them
sweet
sanity
and
i
thought
that
some
did
look
towards
the
pyramid
as
that
they
answered
to
the
mighty
voice
of
the
homecall
and
did
read
the
message
which
the
master
monstruwacan
made
to
them
but
in
a
moment
they
faced
about
seeming
to
have
a
good
obedience
to
one
who
did
always
lead
and
of
whom
i
had
inquired
and
found
to
be
one
named
aschoff
who
was
a
great
athlete
of
the
ninehundredthcity
and
this
same
aschoff
out
of
the
boldness
and
bravery
of
his
heart
did
make
unwitting
to
destroy
the
souls
of
them
all
for
he
went
forward
and
leapt
into
the
billows
of
the
bright
shining
fire
that
made
a
barrier
in
the
way
of
their
destruction
and
immediately
the
fire
ceased
from
its
shining
and
gave
way
and
sank
and
grew
to
a
nothingness
and
aschoff
of
the
ninehundredthcity
began
again
to
run
towards
the
house
of
silence
and
all
they
that
were
with
him
did
follow
faithfully
and
ceased
not
to
run
and
they
came
presently
to
the
low
hill
whereon
was
that
horrid
house
and
they
went
up
swiftlyand
they
were
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
wholesome
of
heart
and
innocent
save
for
a
natural
waywardness
of
spirit
and
they
came
to
the
great
open
doorway
that
hath
been
open
since
the
beginning
and
through
which
the
cold
steadfast
light
and
the
inscrutable
silence
of
evil
hath
made
for
ever
a
silence
that
may
be
felt
in
all
the
land
and
the
great
uncased
windows
gave
out
the
silence
and
the
lightaye
the
utter
silence
of
an
unholy
desolation
and
aschoff
ran
in
through
the
great
doorway
of
silence
and
they
that
followed
and
they
nevermore
came
out
or
were
seen
by
any
human
and
it
must
be
known
that
the
mothers
and
the
fathers
of
those
youths
looked
out
into
the
night
land
and
saw
that
thing
which
came
to
pass
and
all
the
people
were
silent
but
some
said
presently
that
the
youths
would
come
forth
again
yet
the
people
knew
in
their
hearts
that
the
young
men
had
gone
in
to
destruction
for
in
truth
there
was
that
in
the
night
which
spoke
horror
to
the
souls
of
all
and
a
sudden
utter
quiet
in
all
the
land
but
unto
me
that
had
the
nighthearing
there
came
a
great
fear
of
that
which
might
be
whispered
into
my
spirit
out
of
the
quietness
of
the
nightof
the
agony
of
those
young
men
yet
there
came
no
sound
to
the
hearing
of
the
soul
neither
then
nor
in
all
the
years
that
were
to
come
for
in
verity
had
those
youths
passed
into
a
silence
of
which
the
heart
cannot
think
and
here
will
i
tell
how
that
the
strange
quiet
which
did
fill
all
the
land
seeming
to
brood
within
the
night
was
horrid
beyond
all
the
roarings
which
had
passed
over
the
darkness
in
the
time
that
went
before
so
that
it
had
given
my
spirit
some
rest
and
assurance
to
hear
but
the
farechoing
low
thunder
of
the
great
laughter
or
the
whining
which
was
used
at
times
to
sound
in
the
night
from
the
southeast
where
were
the
silverfire
holes
that
opened
before
the
thing
that
nods
or
the
baying
of
the
hounds
or
the
roaring
of
the
giants
or
any
of
those
dreadful
sounds
that
did
often
pass
through
the
night
for
they
could
not
have
offended
me
as
did
that
time
of
silence
and
so
shall
you
judge
how
dreadful
was
that
quiet
which
did
hold
so
much
of
horror
and
surely
it
will
be
known
that
none
had
thinkings
now
even
in
idle
speech
that
any
should
have
power
to
succour
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
neither
as
i
have
said
had
any
the
knowledge
of
the
place
where
it
did
stand
and
so
was
it
made
plain
that
those
peoples
must
suffer
and
come
unhelped
and
alone
to
their
end
which
was
a
sad
and
dreadful
thought
to
any
yet
had
those
within
the
great
pyramid
come
already
to
much
sorrow
and
calamity
because
that
some
had
made
attempt
in
this
matter
and
there
had
been
for
gain
only
failure
and
the
sorrow
of
mothers
and
the
loneliness
of
wives
and
of
kin
and
now
this
dread
horror
upon
us
which
concerned
those
lost
youths
now
as
may
be
conceived
this
sure
knowledge
that
we
might
give
no
succour
to
the
people
of
the
lesser
redoubt
weighed
heavy
upon
my
heart
for
i
had
maybe
with
foolishness
held
vague
hopes
and
wonders
concerning
our
power
to
make
expedition
secretly
into
the
night
to
discover
that
lesser
pyramid
and
rescue
those
poor
thousands
and
above
all
as
may
be
thought
had
i
the
thought
of
that
sweet
moment
in
which
i
should
step
forward
out
of
the
night
and
all
mystery
and
terror
and
put
forth
mine
arms
to
naani
saying
i
am
that
one
and
knowing
in
my
soul
that
she
that
had
been
mine
in
that
bygone
eternity
should
surely
know
me
upon
the
instant
and
call
out
swiftly
and
come
swiftly
and
be
again
unto
me
in
that
age
even
as
she
had
been
in
this
and
to
think
upon
it
and
to
know
that
this
thing
should
never
be
but
that
even
in
that
moment
of
thought
she
that
had
been
mine
in
these
olden
days
of
sweetness
might
be
even
then
suffering
horror
in
the
power
of
some
foul
monster
was
like
a
kind
of
madness
so
that
nearly
i
could
seize
the
diskos
and
run
forth
unprepared
into
the
evil
and
terror
of
the
night
land
that
i
should
make
one
attempt
to
come
to
that
place
where
she
abode
or
else
to
cast
off
my
life
in
the
attempt
and
oft
did
i
call
to
naani
and
always
i
sent
the
masterword
beating
through
the
night
that
she
might
have
assurance
that
it
was
indeed
i
that
did
speak
unto
her
spirit
and
no
foul
thing
or
monster
spelling
evil
and
lies
unto
her
and
oft
did
i
make
to
instruct
her
that
never
should
she
be
tempted
forth
from
the
shelter
of
that
redoubt
in
which
she
did
live
by
any
message
out
of
the
night
but
always
to
await
the
masterword
and
moreover
to
have
a
sure
knowledge
that
none
that
was
her
friend
would
ever
seek
to
entice
her
into
the
night
and
this
way
and
that
way
would
i
speak
with
naani
sending
my
words
silently
with
my
brainelements
yet
was
it
doleful
and
weariful
and
dreadful
always
to
have
speech
into
the
dark
and
never
to
hear
the
answering
beat
of
the
masterword
and
the
sweet
faint
voice
whispering
within
my
soul
yet
once
and
again
would
i
have
knowledge
that
the
aether
did
thrill
about
me
weakly
and
to
mine
inward
hearing
it
would
seem
that
the
masterword
did
beat
faintly
in
the
night
and
thereafter
would
my
heart
have
a
little
comfort
in
that
i
had
assurance
of
a
kind
that
the
lovemaid
of
my
memorydreams
did
still
live
and
constant
i
put
forth
my
soul
to
hark
so
that
my
health
failed
me
with
the
effort
of
my
harking
and
i
would
chide
my
being
that
i
had
not
a
wiser
control
and
so
make
a
fight
to
do
sanely
yet
day
by
day
did
my
heart
grow
more
weary
and
restless
for
indeed
it
did
seem
that
life
was
but
a
very
little
matter
against
so
great
a
loss
as
my
heart
did
feel
to
suffer
and
oft
at
this
time
and
that
did
there
come
a
voice
speaking
plainly
out
of
the
night
and
did
purport
to
be
the
voice
of
naani
but
ever
i
did
say
the
masterword
unto
the
voice
and
the
voice
had
no
power
by
which
it
could
make
the
one
answer
yet
i
jeered
not
at
the
voice
to
show
contempt
of
its
failing
to
bewit
me
but
let
the
matter
bide
and
the
voice
would
be
silent
a
time
and
again
would
make
a
calling
unto
me
but
never
did
i
make
speech
with
it
for
therein
lies
the
danger
to
the
soul
but
always
did
speak
the
masterword
to
its
silencing
and
thereafter
would
shut
the
thing
from
my
memory
and
think
only
upon
sweet
and
holy
matters
as
it
might
be
truth
and
courage
but
more
often
of
naani
which
was
both
sweet
and
holy
to
my
spirit
and
heart
and
being
and
so
it
was
as
i
have
set
down
there
were
monsters
without
in
the
night
that
did
torment
me
having
it
may
be
intent
to
lure
me
unto
destruction
or
indeed
it
doth
chance
that
they
had
no
hope
but
to
plague
me
with
malice
and
as
may
be
thought
all
this
considering
of
my
trouble
and
the
giving
of
my
strength
unto
naani
through
the
night
of
the
world
that
she
might
have
comfort
and
help
did
work
upon
me
so
that
i
grew
thin
plainly
to
the
eye
of
those
that
loved
me
and
the
master
monstruwacan
he
that
did
love
me
as
i
were
his
son
chid
me
gently
and
had
wise
speech
with
me
so
that
i
but
loved
him
the
more
yet
without
having
gain
of
health
for
my
heart
destroyed
me
as
it
doth
if
love
be
held
back
and
made
always
to
weep
and
it
may
be
thought
strange
that
my
mother
and
my
father
did
not
talk
also
with
me
but
i
had
neither
mother
nor
father
those
many
years
and
this
thing
i
should
have
set
down
early
so
that
none
should
waste
thought
pondering
to
no
end
but
the
blame
is
to
my
telling
now
concerning
my
lovetrouble
there
did
happen
a
certain
thing
which
gave
me
to
decide
for
one
night
i
waked
from
a
sore
troubled
sleep
and
it
did
seem
that
naani
did
call
my
name
mine
olden
love
name
and
in
a
voice
of
utter
anguish
and
with
beseeching
and
i
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
sent
the
masterword
into
the
night
with
my
brainelements
and
presently
all
about
me
there
was
the
solemn
beat
of
the
masterword
answering
but
weak
and
gone
faint
that
scarce
i
might
hear
it
and
i
called
again
with
my
brainelements
unto
naani
that
was
mirdath
and
spoke
to
give
her
assurance
and
to
haste
to
tell
unto
me
that
which
was
so
wrong
and
pitiful
with
her
and
who
shall
be
amazed
that
i
was
shaken
with
the
eagerness
of
my
spirit
in
that
it
was
so
long
since
naani
had
spoken
clear
within
my
soul
and
now
behold
her
voice
yet
though
i
did
call
many
a
time
unto
the
everlasting
night
there
came
no
more
the
voice
of
naani
speaking
strangely
within
my
spirit
but
only
at
times
a
weak
thrilling
of
the
aether
about
me
and
at
the
last
i
grew
maddened
with
the
sorrow
of
this
thing
and
the
sense
and
knowledge
of
harm
about
the
maid
and
i
stood
upright
upon
my
feet
and
i
raised
my
hands
and
gave
word
and
honour
unto
naani
through
all
the
blackness
of
the
night
that
i
would
no
more
abide
within
the
mighty
pyramid
to
my
safety
whilst
she
that
had
been
mine
own
through
eternity
came
to
horror
and
destruction
by
the
beasts
and
evil
powers
of
that
dark
world
and
i
gave
the
word
with
my
brainelements
and
bade
her
to
be
of
heart
for
that
until
i
died
i
would
seek
her
but
out
of
the
darkness
there
came
naught
but
the
silence
then
i
clothed
me
swiftly
and
went
up
quickly
to
the
tower
of
observation
that
i
might
speak
instant
with
the
master
monstruwacan
for
my
heart
burned
in
me
to
intention
and
to
be
doing
speedily
that
which
i
had
set
upon
myself
to
do
and
i
came
to
the
master
monstruwacan
and
told
all
to
him
and
how
that
i
did
mean
no
more
to
suffer
in
quiet
and
to
no
end
but
to
make
adventure
into
the
night
land
that
i
find
naani
or
perchance
find
a
swift
peace
from
this
my
long
troubling
now
when
the
master
monstruwacan
heard
that
which
i
had
to
say
it
sat
heavily
upon
him
and
he
besought
me
long
and
many
times
that
i
refrain
from
this
thing
for
that
none
might
achieve
so
great
a
task
but
that
i
should
be
lost
in
my
youth
before
many
days
were
gone
by
yet
to
all
his
speech
i
said
naught
save
that
this
thing
was
laid
upon
me
and
even
as
i
had
promised
so
should
i
make
to
act
and
in
the
ending
the
master
monstruwacan
perceived
that
i
was
set
to
this
thing
and
not
to
be
moved
and
he
did
put
it
to
me
how
that
i
had
grown
to
leanness
with
so
much
troubling
and
that
i
should
have
wisdom
to
wait
awhile
that
i
put
on
my
full
strength
but
even
as
i
was
so
would
i
go
and
this
i
told
to
him
gently
and
showed
how
that
the
thing
was
meet
and
helpful
to
the
safety
of
my
soul
for
that
my
strength
was
still
in
me
yet
was
i
sweeter
in
spirit
because
that
i
stood
lean
and
pure
and
much
poor
dross
and
littleness
had
been
burned
from
me
so
that
fear
was
not
in
me
and
all
do
i
lay
to
the
count
of
my
love
which
doth
purify
and
make
sweet
and
fearless
the
human
heart
and
because
i
was
even
as
i
have
said
so
was
i
the
less
in
trouble
of
the
forces
of
evil
for
long
and
sore
had
been
my
preparation
of
spirit
and
i
wot
that
none
had
ever
gone
forth
into
the
darkness
so
long
withholden
from
that
which
doth
weaken
and
taint
the
spirit
and
here
let
me
set
down
how
that
the
three
days
of
preparation
which
were
proper
to
those
that
willed
to
go
forth
into
the
night
land
had
for
their
chief
aim
the
cleansing
of
the
spirit
so
that
the
powers
of
evil
did
have
a
less
ableness
to
harm
but
also
it
was
as
i
have
said
that
none
should
go
forth
in
ignorance
of
the
full
dreadfulness
of
all
that
held
the
night
for
it
was
at
the
preparation
that
there
was
made
known
certain
horrors
that
were
not
told
unto
the
young
and
of
horrid
mutilations
and
of
abasements
of
the
soul
that
did
shake
the
heart
with
fear
if
but
they
were
whispered
into
the
hearing
and
these
things
were
not
set
down
in
any
book
that
might
be
lightly
come
by
but
were
warded
and
safe
locked
by
the
master
of
the
preparation
in
the
room
of
preparation
and
indeed
when
i
did
hear
that
which
presently
i
was
to
hear
i
had
wonder
in
my
heart
that
ever
any
went
out
into
the
night
land
or
that
ever
the
room
of
preparation
should
have
other
than
students
that
meant
not
to
go
forth
but
only
to
achieve
some
knowledge
of
that
which
hath
been
done
and
mayhaps
shall
be
once
again
yet
in
verity
is
this
but
the
way
of
the
human
heart
and
hath
always
been
and
will
be
so
in
all
the
years
for
ever
for
to
adventure
is
the
lust
of
youth
and
to
leave
safety
is
the
natural
waywardness
of
the
spirit
and
who
shall
reprove
or
regret
for
it
were
sorrowful
that
this
spirit
of
man
should
cease
yet
must
it
not
be
thought
that
i
do
uphold
fightings
to
the
death
or
to
mutilation
between
man
and
man
but
rather
do
sorrow
upon
this
thought
now
when
the
morrow
came
if
thus
i
shall
speak
of
that
which
was
outwardly
even
as
the
night
though
changing
alway
within
the
mighty
pyramid
i
went
unto
the
room
of
preparation
and
the
door
was
closed
upon
me
and
i
underwent
the
full
preparation
that
i
might
have
full
power
and
aid
to
come
to
success
through
all
the
terror
of
the
night
land
and
three
days
and
three
nights
did
i
abide
within
the
room
of
preparation
and
upon
the
fourth
day
was
mine
armour
brought
unto
me
and
the
master
of
the
preparation
stood
away
from
me
silent
and
with
sorrow
upon
his
face
but
touching
me
not
neither
coming
anigh
to
aid
me
nor
having
any
speech
with
me
for
none
might
crowd
upon
me
or
cause
me
to
answer
and
presently
was
i
clad
with
the
grey
armour
and
below
the
armour
a
closeknit
suit
of
special
shaping
and
texture
to
have
the
shape
of
the
armour
and
that
i
might
not
die
by
the
cold
of
the
night
land
and
i
placed
upon
me
a
scrip
of
food
and
drink
that
might
keep
the
life
within
me
for
a
great
time
by
reason
of
its
preparation
and
this
lay
ready
to
me
with
the
armour
and
was
stitched
about
with
the
mark
of
honour
so
that
i
knew
loving
women
thus
to
speed
me
and
when
all
was
done
and
made
ready
i
took
up
the
diskos
and
bowed
in
silence
to
the
master
of
the
preparation
and
he
went
towards
the
door
and
opened
it
and
signalled
that
the
people
stand
back
so
that
i
might
go
forth
untouched
and
the
people
stood
back
for
many
had
crowded
to
the
door
of
the
room
of
preparation
so
that
i
knew
how
that
my
story
must
be
to
the
heart
of
all
in
all
the
cities
of
the
great
redoubt
for
to
come
unbidden
anigh
that
door
was
against
the
lesser
law
and
that
any
erred
in
this
matter
betokened
much
and
i
went
out
through
the
door
and
there
was
a
mighty
lane
of
people
unto
the
great
lift
and
about
the
great
lift
as
i
went
downwards
did
the
countless
millions
stand
and
all
in
a
great
silence
but
having
dear
sympathy
in
their
souls
yet
loyal
unto
my
safety
in
that
none
in
all
the
mighty
pyramid
did
make
speech
unto
me
or
call
out
aught
and
as
i
went
downward
through
the
miles
lo
all
the
aether
of
the
world
seemed
to
be
surged
with
the
silent
prayers
and
speedings
of
those
quiet
multitudes
and
i
came
at
last
unto
the
great
gate
and
behold
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
did
stand
in
full
armour
and
with
the
diskos
to
do
me
honour
with
the
full
watch
as
i
went
forth
and
i
looked
at
him
quietly
and
he
looked
unto
me
and
i
bent
my
head
to
show
respect
and
he
made
silent
salute
with
the
diskos
and
afterwards
i
went
onwards
towards
the
great
gateway
and
they
made
dim
the
lights
in
the
great
causeway
that
there
should
no
glare
go
forth
into
the
land
when
the
gate
was
opened
and
behold
they
opened
not
the
lesser
gate
within
the
greater
for
me
but
did
honour
my
journey
in
that
they
swung
wide
the
great
gate
itself
through
which
a
monstrous
army
might
pass
and
there
was
an
utter
silence
all
about
the
gate
and
in
the
hushed
light
the
two
thousand
that
made
the
full
watch
held
up
each
the
diskos
silently
to
make
salute
and
humbly
i
held
up
the
diskos
reversed
and
went
forward
into
the
dark
vi
the
way
that
i
did
go
now
i
went
forward
for
a
space
and
took
heed
not
to
look
backwards
but
to
be
strong
of
heart
and
spirit
for
that
which
did
lie
before
me
had
need
of
all
my
manhood
and
courage
of
soul
that
i
come
to
the
succour
of
that
maid
afar
in
the
darkness
of
the
world
or
meet
my
death
proper
as
it
might
need
to
be
and
thus
did
i
go
forward
steadfastly
and
conscious
in
all
my
being
of
the
emotions
of
that
parting
from
my
mighty
home
and
of
the
tenderness
and
wiseness
that
did
underlie
so
much
curbed
rule
and
guidance
and
my
heart
was
warm
towards
the
master
monstruwacan
for
that
great
honour
that
he
should
come
downward
in
armour
to
make
one
with
the
full
watch
that
he
might
uphold
me
to
a
lofty
spirit
at
the
moment
of
my
going
and
all
that
time
as
i
went
forward
was
the
aether
of
the
night
about
me
in
tumult
with
the
thoughts
and
blind
wishings
of
the
great
millions
i
had
but
now
left
to
my
back
and
presently
as
i
steadied
somewhat
upon
my
emotions
i
was
conscious
of
the
exceeding
coldness
of
the
night
air
and
of
the
different
taste
of
it
upon
my
lungs
and
in
the
mouth
and
it
had
as
it
were
a
wondrous
keen
sharping
upon
my
palate
and
did
fill
the
lips
more
in
the
breathing
so
that
it
may
be
supposed
it
had
more
body
within
it
than
that
air
which
did
fill
the
plateau
of
the
thousandth
city
where
was
my
home
for
the
air
of
every
city
was
of
difference
and
the
greater
between
one
that
was
afar
up
and
another
nigh
to
the
earth
as
may
be
thought
so
that
many
peoples
did
migrate
unto
that
level
which
gave
them
best
healthfulness
but
under
rule
and
with
a
guidance
of
quantities
and
not
all
that
were
lacking
of
health
for
some
are
ever
contrary
and
here
let
me
set
down
that
within
the
deeps
of
the
fields
there
was
air
utter
varied
and
wonderful
that
might
charm
one
here
and
likewise
sorrow
another
that
were
happier
elsewhere
so
that
all
might
have
suiting
did
they
but
wander
and
have
reason
to
companion
them
and
thus
did
i
go
forward
full
of
new
thoughts
and
olden
memories
and
freshbreaking
wonders
neither
forgetting
something
of
doubts
and
fears
more
than
a
little
and
again
was
it
most
cunning
strange
to
be
out
there
in
the
night
landthough
not
yet
afarwhere
often
had
my
fancies
and
imaginings
led
me
yet
until
that
time
never
had
i
touched
foot
in
all
that
life
upon
the
outward
earth
and
this
must
be
a
wondrous
quaint
seeming
thought
to
those
of
this
present
day
and
so
came
i
at
last
nigh
to
the
circle
that
did
go
about
the
redoubt
and
presently
i
was
come
to
it
and
something
astonished
was
i
that
it
had
no
great
bigness
for
i
had
looked
for
this
by
reasoning
having
always
a
mind
to
picture
things
as
they
might
be
truly
and
hence
coming
sometimes
to
the
wonder
of
a
great
truth
but
odd
whiles
to
errors
that
others
had
not
made
and
now
lo
i
did
find
it
but
a
small
clear
tube
that
had
not
two
inches
of
thickness
yet
sent
out
a
very
bright
and
strong
light
so
that
it
seemed
greater
to
the
eye
did
one
but
behold
from
a
distance
and
this
is
but
a
little
thing
to
set
to
the
telling
yet
may
it
give
something
of
the
newness
of
all
and
moreover
shall
you
have
memory
with
me
in
this
place
how
that
oft
had
i
seen
things
and
beastmonsters
peer
over
that
same
little
tube
of
light
their
faces
coming
forward
out
of
the
night
and
this
had
i
seen
as
child
and
man
for
as
children
we
did
use
to
keep
oft
a
watch
by
hours
upon
an
holidaytime
through
the
great
glasses
of
the
embrasures
and
we
did
always
hope
each
to
be
that
one
that
should
first
discover
a
monster
looking
inwards
upon
the
mighty
pyramid
across
the
shining
of
the
circle
and
these
to
come
oft
yet
presently
to
slink
away
into
the
night
having
in
verity
no
liking
for
that
light
and
pride
had
we
taken
of
ourselves
to
perceive
those
monsters
which
had
most
of
ugliness
and
horror
to
commend
them
for
thereby
did
we
stand
to
have
won
the
game
of
watching
until
such
time
as
a
more
fearsome
brute
be
discovered
and
so
went
the
play
yet
with
ever
it
doth
seem
to
me
now
something
of
a
halfknown
shudder
to
the
heart
and
a
childs
rejoicing
unknowingly
in
that
safety
which
had
power
to
make
light
the
seeming
of
such
matters
and
this
also
is
but
a
small
matter
yet
doth
it
bear
upon
the
inwardness
of
my
feelings
for
the
memories
of
all
my
youth
and
of
the
many
beasts
that
i
had
seen
to
peer
across
the
light
did
come
upwards
in
my
mind
in
that
moment
so
that
i
did
give
back
a
little
unthinking
of
what
i
did
but
having
upon
me
the
sudden
imagining
of
that
which
might
come
out
of
the
dark
beyond
and
i
to
stand
a
little
moment
and
presently
had
grown
free
in
my
heart
to
have
courage
of
farewell
and
so
did
turn
me
at
last
to
the
viewing
of
that
wondrous
home
of
the
last
millions
of
this
world
and
the
sight
was
an
astonishment
and
an
uplifting
that
indeed
there
was
so
mighty
a
thing
in
all
the
earth
and
well
might
be
that
there
were
monsters
and
forces
gathered
together
about
that
hill
of
life
out
of
all
the
darkness
of
the
world
for
the
thing
was
as
a
mighty
mountain
that
went
up
measureless
into
the
night
and
spread
out
upon
the
earth
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
of
me
so
that
it
did
seem
to
hold
all
the
world
with
its
might
and
in
the
nearer
slope
were
there
three
hundred
thousand
great
embrasures
as
well
i
did
know
there
being
in
all
the
four
sides
of
the
redoubt
twelve
hundred
thousand
embrasures
as
was
set
out
in
the
books
of
the
schools
and
upon
the
cover
of
atlasbooks
as
they
still
quaintly
to
be
called
and
many
another
place
as
might
be
supposed
and
half
a
mile
upward
was
the
lowest
tier
of
those
great
windowplaces
and
above
that
countless
other
tiers
and
a
great
light
came
out
from
them
into
the
darkness
so
that
i
looked
up
into
the
night
many
miles
and
yet
did
see
them
in
shining
rows
and
did
make
separate
each
embrasure
from
its
fellow
for
a
great
way
but
there
grew
yet
more
above
in
the
mighty
distance
so
that
they
were
lost
in
the
upward
space
of
the
night
and
did
seem
to
me
presently
but
as
a
constant
glimmering
fire
that
did
shape
a
shining
peak
into
the
blackness
of
the
heavens
dwindling
into
the
utmost
height
and
thus
was
that
everlasting
monument
then
did
it
come
to
me
that
those
little
things
which
i
did
see
to
cluster
against
the
embrasures
were
in
truth
the
countless
millions
of
the
mighty
redoubt
and
this
i
could
make
out
with
some
plainness
in
those
lower
embrasures
which
were
the
more
near
to
me
than
they
above
for
the
peoples
were
set
against
the
light
within
yet
were
as
small
things
like
unto
insects
in
that
distance
and
within
so
huge
a
bulk
and
i
knew
that
they
looked
out
upon
me
and
did
watch
through
their
spyglasses
and
i
sent
my
gaze
upwards
again
along
that
great
slope
of
grey
metal
aye
upward
again
to
where
it
strode
glimmering
into
the
blackness
and
so
at
last
to
the
little
star
that
did
crown
that
wonder
of
the
world
in
the
eternal
night
and
for
a
little
i
did
stare
towards
that
far
light
for
it
came
from
within
that
tower
of
observation
where
so
lately
i
had
spended
my
life
and
i
had
knowledge
within
my
heart
that
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
did
bend
the
great
spyglass
upon
me
through
which
so
oft
had
i
spied
and
i
raised
the
diskos
unto
him
in
salutation
and
farewell
though
i
saw
him
not
at
all
through
that
vast
space
and
my
heart
was
very
full
yet
my
soul
but
the
stronger
for
it
and
then
behold
i
was
aware
of
a
murmur
in
the
night
coming
to
me
dim
and
from
afar
off
and
i
saw
the
little
shapes
of
the
peoples
in
the
lower
embrasures
in
constant
movement
and
i
knew
upon
the
instant
that
the
multitudes
did
take
that
salute
unto
themselves
and
cried
out
and
waved
to
me
their
farewells
or
to
come
backas
may
be
and
indeed
i
was
but
a
lonesome
person
looking
up
at
that
great
mountain
of
metal
and
life
and
i
knew
that
i
had
danger
to
realise
my
plight
and
i
stayed
no
more
but
did
raise
the
diskos
reversed
as
was
but
meet
from
one
young
man
unto
all
the
millions
and
i
looked
swiftly
upward
through
those
eight
great
miles
of
night
unto
that
final
light
which
did
shine
in
the
black
heavens
so
that
my
friend
should
know
that
i
thought
of
him
that
was
beyond
my
sight
in
that
last
moment
and
it
may
be
that
the
invisible
millions
that
were
far
up
in
the
night
in
the
upper
cities
did
take
that
also
to
be
a
meaning
of
farewell
to
themselves
for
there
came
down
out
of
the
monstrous
height
a
far
faint
murmur
of
sound
as
of
a
vague
wind
up
in
the
night
then
did
i
lower
the
diskos
and
turn
me
about
and
i
breasted
strangely
against
the
air
clog
and
stept
forward
across
the
circle
into
the
lonesomeness
of
the
night
land
and
i
looked
no
more
behind
for
that
which
was
my
home
did
weaken
my
heart
somewhat
to
behold
so
that
i
made
determination
that
i
look
not
again
to
my
back
for
a
great
while
yet
about
me
as
i
went
there
was
constant
surging
in
the
aether
of
the
world
and
it
did
tell
unto
me
how
that
those
my
people
and
kin
had
continual
mind
of
me
both
in
prayer
and
wishings
and
in
a
perpetual
watching
and
the
same
gave
to
me
a
feeling
as
of
being
something
companied
yet
in
a
time
it
came
to
me
that
this
disturbance
of
the
aether
should
tell
to
some
evil
force
how
that
i
was
there
abroad
in
the
land
but
how
to
stop
this
thing
who
should
have
power
for
of
truth
had
i
been
among
them
to
make
a
full
explaining
of
the
danger
they
had
been
yet
powerless
to
cease
for
but
to
have
such
great
multitudes
athink
upon
one
matter
was
to
set
a
disturbance
about
as
should
be
most
clear
to
all
now
at
the
beginning
i
did
walk
outwards
into
the
night
land
somewhat
blindly
and
without
sure
direction
being
intent
only
to
put
a
good
space
to
my
back
that
i
might
cure
somewhat
the
ache
which
did
weaken
my
heart
at
the
first
but
in
awhile
i
ceased
somewhat
from
my
overswiftness
and
did
put
thought
to
my
going
and
i
came
quickly
to
reason
that
i
should
try
a
new
way
through
the
land
for
it
might
be
that
there
was
an
overwatchfulness
in
that
part
which
had
been
trod
by
the
youths
and
i
began
therewith
to
set
this
thought
to
the
practice
and
went
not
direct
towards
the
north
but
to
the
north
and
west
and
so
in
the
end
to
mean
to
circle
around
to
the
back
of
the
northwest
watcher
and
thence
to
the
north
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
afterwards
as
might
be
have
a
true
and
straightway
to
the
north
and
by
this
planning
come
a
long
way
clear
of
that
house
of
silence
which
did
put
more
fear
upon
me
than
all
else
that
was
horrid
in
the
land
yet
as
all
will
see
this
made
to
me
a
greater
journey
though
in
verity
it
were
better
to
go
slowly
and
win
to
success
than
to
make
a
greater
haste
towards
destruction
which
was
indeed
surely
to
be
mine
end
did
i
not
go
warily
now
it
may
be
thought
upon
with
wonder
that
i
did
go
so
assuredly
to
the
north
but
i
went
thiswise
part
by
an
inward
knowing
and
part
come
upon
by
much
latter
studying
within
the
pyramid
of
olden
books
and
by
reasoning
upon
all
things
that
i
did
observe
that
had
seemings
of
verity
in
them
and
because
of
this
constant
searching
upon
one
matter
i
had
come
but
a
while
back
upon
a
little
book
of
metal
very
strange
and
ancient
that
had
lain
forgot
in
a
hid
place
in
the
great
library
through
ten
hundred
thousand
years
maybe
or
less
or
more
for
all
that
i
had
knowing
and
much
that
was
writ
in
the
book
was
common
knowledge
and
set
mostly
to
the
count
of
fairytales
and
suchlike
even
as
we
of
this
our
age
take
not
oversurely
any
belief
in
myths
of
olden
times
yet
had
i
always
much
liking
for
such
matters
perceiving
behind
that
outer
shell
which
did
win
always
so
much
unbelief
the
kernel
of
ancient
truths
and
happenings
and
thus
was
it
concerning
this
little
book
which
i
had
made
discovery
of
for
it
told
again
that
which
oft
i
had
heard
even
as
we
in
this
age
read
of
the
deluge
how
that
once
in
a
time
monstrous
far
back
from
that
but
utter
future
to
this
age
of
ours
the
world
did
brake
upwards
in
a
vast
earthquaking
that
did
rend
the
world
for
a
thousand
miles
and
there
came
a
mighty
chasm
so
deep
that
none
might
see
the
bottom
thereof
and
there
rushed
therein
an
ocean
and
the
earth
did
burst
afresh
with
a
sound
that
did
shake
all
the
cities
of
the
world
and
a
great
mist
lay
upon
the
earth
for
many
days
and
there
was
a
mighty
rain
and
indeed
this
was
just
so
set
in
certain
histories
of
the
ancient
world
also
there
was
made
reference
to
it
within
some
olden
records
yet
nowise
to
be
taken
with
a
serious
mind
to
the
seeming
of
the
peoples
of
the
mighty
pyramid
but
only
as
a
quaint
study
for
the
students
and
to
be
set
out
in
little
tales
that
did
entertain
the
nurseries
or
as
it
might
be
wise
men
and
the
general
yet
there
was
this
about
that
small
and
peculiar
book
that
it
did
speak
of
many
of
these
things
as
it
were
that
it
did
quote
from
the
pens
of
those
that
did
have
actual
witness
and
set
all
out
with
a
strange
gravity
that
did
cause
one
to
consider
it
as
meant
to
be
indeed
the
tellings
of
truth
and
to
seem
thiswise
to
have
great
difference
from
all
that
i
had
read
before
concerning
those
matters
and
there
was
further
a
part
in
the
ending
of
the
book
that
did
seem
to
be
writ
of
a
time
that
came
afterwards
maybe
an
hundred
thousand
and
maybe
a
million
years
but
who
shall
say
and
therein
it
did
tell
of
an
huge
and
mighty
valley
that
did
come
out
of
the
west
towards
the
southeast
and
made
turning
thence
northwards
and
was
a
thousand
miles
both
ways
and
the
sides
thereof
were
an
hundred
miles
deep
and
the
sun
did
stand
in
the
western
end
and
made
a
red
gloom
for
a
thousand
miles
and
in
the
bottom
there
were
great
seas
and
beasts
strange
and
awesome
and
very
plentiful
now
this
as
may
be
seen
was
as
the
talk
of
romance
yet
did
i
turn
my
wits
to
their
natural
end
and
made
thus
plain
of
it
for
in
truth
i
to
have
something
of
belief
and
it
to
seem
to
me
that
in
a
bygone
eternity
when
the
world
was
yet
light
as
in
my
heart
i
knew
to
have
been
indeed
a
thing
of
verity
there
was
a
great
and
wondrous
earthquake
and
the
earthquake
did
burst
the
world
up
along
a
certain
great
curve
where
it
had
weakness
and
there
fell
into
the
yawning
furnace
of
the
world
one
of
the
great
oceans
and
immediately
made
of
itself
steam
and
so
brake
upwards
again
and
tore
the
earth
mightily
in
its
swift
uprising
and
thereafter
there
was
a
mist
and
confusion
and
rain
upon
the
world
and
indeed
all
very
seemly
put
and
not
to
be
taken
as
a
light
tale
then
in
that
ending
of
the
book
there
was
one
that
did
write
having
lived
in
a
vast
later
age
when
the
sun
had
come
anigh
to
his
dying
and
the
upward
earth
was
grown
quiet
and
cold
and
not
good
to
live
upon
and
in
that
time
the
mighty
chasm
had
been
calmed
by
the
weight
of
an
eternity
so
that
it
was
now
a
most
deep
and
wondrous
valley
that
did
hold
seas
and
great
hills
and
mountains
and
in
it
were
great
forests
of
kinds
and
lands
that
were
good
and
healthful
and
places
given
over
to
fire
and
to
steamings
and
sulphur
clouds
so
that
they
held
poisons
that
had
ill
for
man
and
great
beasts
were
there
down
in
that
far
depth
that
none
might
see
ever
save
by
a
strong
spyglass
and
such
there
were
in
the
early
world
and
had
now
been
bred
in
the
ending
by
those
inward
forces
of
nature
which
did
make
the
valley
a
place
of
good
warmth
so
that
there
was
as
it
were
once
more
the
primal
world
born
to
give
new
birth
unto
such
olden
monsters
and
to
others
new
and
peculiar
to
that
age
and
circumstance
and
all
this
indeed
did
the
book
give
also
but
constrained
and
difficult
to
take
clearly
to
the
heart
and
not
like
to
the
wise
plain
speech
of
the
early
tellings
so
that
i
must
even
set
it
out
here
in
mine
own
speech
and
it
did
seem
to
me
by
my
reading
that
man
had
come
at
one
time
to
a
great
softness
of
heart
and
spirit
through
many
ages
of
overease
but
that
the
world
did
come
to
coldness
and
unfriendliness
by
reason
of
the
suns
slow
ceasing
and
there
was
presently
in
naturalness
a
race
upon
the
earth
that
were
hardy
and
made
to
fight
for
their
lives
and
did
perceive
that
the
mighty
valley
that
cut
the
world
in
twain
was
a
place
of
warmth
and
life
and
so
did
make
to
adventure
their
bodies
down
that
wondrous
height
and
were
many
ages
coming
safe
to
the
bottom
but
did
find
safe
places
in
the
downward
way
where
they
built
them
houses
and
made
to
live
and
begot
them
children
and
these
grew
up
to
that
life
of
constant
and
great
climbings
and
of
hard
workings
upon
the
road
which
was
the
one
intent
of
that
people
so
that
the
book
did
speak
of
them
always
as
the
road
makers
and
thus
did
they
make
downwards
through
the
long
years
and
the
ages
and
many
generations
did
live
and
die
and
saw
not
the
reaching
of
the
road
down
into
that
great
vale
that
lay
so
monstrous
deep
in
the
world
but
in
the
end
they
did
come
there
with
the
road
and
they
were
very
hardy
and
they
did
fight
with
the
monsters
and
slay
many
and
they
built
them
many
cities
through
great
years
in
the
mighty
valley
and
did
make
the
road
from
city
unto
city
along
that
great
valley
even
unto
the
bight
of
the
valley
and
they
found
here
a
constant
darkness
and
shadow
for
that
the
sun
could
not
make
a
shining
around
that
great
corner
yet
even
here
they
ceased
not
to
make
the
road
but
took
it
around
and
a
mighty
way
unto
the
north
passing
it
among
strange
fires
and
pits
that
burned
from
out
of
the
earth
but
there
was
presently
such
a
power
and
horror
of
monsters
and
evil
things
in
that
valley
of
shadow
that
the
road
makers
were
made
to
go
backwards
into
the
red
light
which
did
fill
the
westward
valley
and
came
from
that
low
sun
and
they
went
back
unto
their
cities
and
lived
there
mayhaps
an
hundred
thousand
years
and
grew
wise
and
cunning
in
all
matters
and
their
wise
people
did
make
dealings
and
had
experiment
with
those
forces
which
are
distasteful
and
harmful
unto
life
but
they
did
this
in
ignorance
for
all
that
they
had
much
wisdom
thinking
only
to
experiment
that
they
come
to
greater
knowings
but
they
did
open
a
way
for
those
forces
and
much
harm
and
pity
did
come
thereby
and
then
had
all
people
to
have
regret
yet
too
late
now
presently
when
an
hundred
thousand
years
had
gone
or
it
may
be
a
greater
space
there
came
slowly
the
utter
twilight
of
the
world
as
the
sun
to
die
the
more
so
that
presently
it
gave
but
an
utter
gloomy
light
and
there
grew
upon
many
of
the
peoples
of
the
cities
of
the
valley
a
strangeness
and
a
wildness
so
that
strange
things
were
done
that
had
been
shameful
to
all
in
the
light
and
there
were
wanderings
and
consortings
with
strange
outward
beings
and
presently
many
cities
were
attacked
by
monsters
that
did
come
from
the
west
and
there
was
a
pandemonium
then
was
an
age
of
sorrows
and
fightings
and
hardenings
of
the
spirit
and
of
the
heart
for
all
that
were
of
good
fibre
and
this
did
breed
a
determined
generation
and
there
grew
up
into
the
world
a
leader
and
he
took
all
the
sound
millions
and
did
make
a
mighty
battle
upon
all
foulness
and
upon
all
that
did
harm
and
trouble
them
and
they
drove
their
enemies
down
the
valley
and
up
the
valley
and
did
utterly
scatter
and
put
them
to
flight
then
did
that
man
call
all
his
peoples
together
and
did
make
it
plain
how
that
the
darkness
grew
upon
the
world
and
that
the
foul
and
dreadful
powers
abroad
were
like
to
be
more
horrid
when
a
greater
gloom
came
and
he
put
to
them
that
they
build
a
mighty
refuge
and
the
peoples
did
acclaim
and
lo
there
was
built
presently
a
great
house
but
the
great
house
was
not
proper
and
that
man
did
take
all
the
peoples
to
wander
and
they
came
to
the
bight
and
there
was
built
at
last
that
great
and
mighty
pyramid
now
this
is
the
sense
and
telling
of
that
book
and
but
late
had
i
read
it
and
talked
somewhat
of
it
with
my
dear
friend
the
master
monstruwacan
but
not
overmuch
for
i
had
taken
so
sudden
a
mind
to
go
that
all
else
had
dropped
from
about
me
yet
to
us
it
did
seem
clear
that
there
was
no
life
in
all
the
invisible
upper
world
and
that
surely
that
great
road
whereon
the
silent
ones
did
walk
must
be
that
same
road
which
the
hardy
peoples
of
that
age
did
make
and
it
did
seem
wise
to
the
master
monstruwacan
and
unto
me
that
if
any
should
find
the
lesser
redoubt
they
must
surely
do
so
somewhere
within
the
mighty
valley
but
whether
the
road
that
led
into
the
west
where
was
the
place
of
the
abhumans
should
bring
me
to
it
i
had
no
knowing
nor
whether
it
might
lie
on
the
northward
way
and
i
maybe
to
wander
a
thousand
miles
wrong
if
in
truth
i
were
not
into
some
dreadful
trouble
before
and
indeed
no
reason
of
value
was
there
to
give
me
hope
that
the
lesser
pyramid
lay
either
to
the
west
or
where
the
road
went
northward
beyond
the
house
of
silence
yet
i
did
so
feel
it
to
be
somewhere
to
the
north
that
i
had
made
a
determination
to
search
that
way
for
a
great
distance
the
first
and
if
i
could
not
come
upon
aught
then
i
should
have
sober
thought
that
it
did
lie
westward
but
in
the
valley
someways
i
had
feeling
of
assurance
that
it
must
be
for
it
was
plain
that
the
telling
of
the
book
was
sound
in
its
bottom
sense
as
might
be
seen
for
how
should
any
live
in
the
utter
bleak
and
deadly
chill
of
the
silent
upper
world
that
lay
an
hundred
miles
up
in
the
night
hid
and
lost
for
ever
and
strange
is
it
to
think
of
those
wondrous
and
mighty
cliffs
that
girt
us
about
and
yet
were
fast
held
from
us
in
the
dark
so
that
i
had
not
known
of
them
save
for
the
telling
of
that
book
though
in
truth
it
had
been
always
supposed
that
we
lived
in
a
great
deep
of
the
world
but
indeed
it
was
rather
held
in
belief
that
we
abode
in
the
bed
of
some
ancient
sea
that
did
surely
slope
gradual
away
from
us
and
not
go
up
abrupt
and
savage
and
here
let
me
make
so
clear
as
i
may
that
the
general
peoples
had
no
clear
thought
upon
any
such
matters
though
there
was
something
of
it
taught
in
the
schools
yet
rather
this
and
that
of
diverse
conclusions
as
it
might
be
thinkings
of
the
teachers
after
much
study
and
some
ponderings
for
one
man
having
a
lack
of
imagining
would
scoff
and
another
maybe
to
take
it
very
staidly
but
some
would
build
fancy
upon
the
tellings
of
the
records
and
make
foolish
and
fantastic
that
which
had
groundings
in
truth
and
thus
is
it
ever
but
to
the
most
peoples
of
the
pyramid
there
was
no
deep
conviction
nor
thought
of
any
great
hid
world
afar
in
the
darkness
for
they
gave
attention
and
belief
only
to
that
which
lay
to
their
view
nor
could
a
great
lot
come
to
imagine
that
there
had
been
ever
any
other
condition
and
to
them
it
did
seem
right
and
meet
that
there
should
be
strange
things
and
fires
from
the
earth
and
an
everabiding
night
and
monsters
and
matters
hid
and
tangled
much
in
mystery
and
very
content
were
the
most
of
them
though
some
had
in
them
the
yeast
of
imaginings
or
the
pimples
of
fancy
upon
them
and
to
these
there
seemed
many
possibilities
though
the
first
to
read
out
to
sanity
and
the
second
to
expect
and
have
speech
towards
much
that
was
foolish
or
to
no
purpose
and
of
these
vague
believings
of
the
peoples
have
i
made
hint
before
and
need
not
have
much
trouble
to
it
now
save
that
with
the
children
as
is
ever
the
way
those
olden
tales
had
much
believing
and
the
simplicity
of
the
wise
did
mate
with
the
beliefs
of
the
young
and
between
them
did
lie
the
truth
and
so
did
i
make
speed
towards
the
north
having
a
strong
surety
in
my
heart
and
mind
that
there
were
but
two
ways
to
my
search
for
without
of
the
valley
afar
up
in
the
dead
lonesomeness
of
the
hidden
world
was
a
cold
that
was
shapen
ready
to
death
and
a
lacking
as
i
must
believe
of
the
sweet
needful
air
that
yet
did
lie
in
plenty
in
that
deep
place
of
the
earth
so
that
surely
the
mighty
valley
somewheres
to
hold
that
other
redoubt
yet
as
i
have
said
i
went
not
direct
to
my
journey
but
otherwise
for
those
sound
reasons
which
i
did
set
down
a
time
back
vii
the
night
land
now
as
i
went
towards
the
north
and
west
i
steered
me
warily
for
a
great
while
that
i
come
safe
of
that
great
watcher
of
the
northwest
and
as
i
made
forward
i
put
thought
to
all
matters
which
must
concern
me
so
far
as
i
had
imagining
to
see
and
first
i
did
consider
the
speed
that
i
should
keep
and
found
presently
that
i
did
well
to
be
moderate
for
that
i
had
before
me
a
great
and
mighty
journey
and
indeed
who
might
speak
knowingly
of
the
end
thereof
and
another
matter
i
did
arrange
for
i
would
make
the
times
of
my
goings
forward
and
the
times
of
mine
eatings
and
sleepings
all
to
a
wise
and
regular
fashion
that
thereby
i
might
go
a
great
way
with
the
less
harm
to
my
body
so
that
i
should
be
strong
when
the
need
did
come
for
my
strength
and
i
made
in
the
end
that
i
should
eat
and
drink
at
every
sixth
hour
and
at
the
eighteenth
hour
sleep
me
until
the
twentyfourth
and
by
this
means
did
i
eat
thrice
in
that
time
and
have
six
hours
of
sleep
and
this
seemed
very
good
to
me
and
i
did
strive
always
to
manage
thus
in
all
my
great
journeying
in
the
night
land
yet
as
may
be
supposed
there
were
times
oft
and
many
when
i
must
watch
without
ceasing
and
leave
my
slumber
unto
the
future
for
the
land
was
full
of
grim
and
dreadful
perils
and
as
doth
be
human
i
brake
my
rule
straightway
in
the
beginning
for
i
ceased
not
to
walk
for
oneandtwenty
hours
hiding
and
creeping
as
the
need
did
be
in
those
places
that
were
like
to
show
me
unto
the
watcher
and
when
i
did
think
upon
food
it
did
sicken
me
so
that
i
would
eat
by
and
by
as
i
made
it
within
my
thoughts
but
when
oneandtwenty
hours
had
gone
i
grew
very
weary
and
something
faint
and
was
forced
that
i
look
about
for
some
place
where
i
might
have
rest
and
in
a
little
while
i
did
see
away
off
a
small
firehole
the
like
of
which
i
had
passed
odd
times
even
so
early
and
i
made
to
come
nigh
to
that
part
for
there
would
be
warmth
from
the
chill
of
the
night
land
and
mayhaps
a
place
dry
and
convenient
to
my
slumber
and
when
i
came
anigh
i
saw
that
it
was
a
cheerful
place
as
it
might
be
said
amid
so
much
gloom
for
the
hole
was
but
a
few
paces
wide
and
full
of
a
dull
glowing
fire
that
did
bubble
somewhat
and
throw
off
a
small
sulphursmoke
and
i
sat
me
down
at
no
great
way
and
did
place
the
diskos
on
the
rock
to
my
hand
and
i
moved
not
awhile
but
was
aweary
so
that
i
had
not
the
courage
to
eat
neither
to
drink
but
must
turn
me
and
look
back
to
the
mighty
pyramid
and
in
truth
though
i
had
come
a
very
good
space
yet
was
i
so
anigh
to
it
that
i
was
both
cheered
and
put
out
of
heart
for
it
did
seem
close
upon
me
by
reason
of
its
greatness
so
that
i
who
had
journeyed
a
hard
and
weariful
way
was
shaken
with
the
greatness
of
the
task
that
was
upon
me
yet
was
this
but
one
side
of
my
heart
for
it
was
good
to
feel
the
nearness
of
my
mighty
home
and
i
knew
that
there
did
countless
millions
make
watch
upon
me
as
i
sat
yet
did
i
make
no
sign
for
it
is
not
meet
to
make
a
constant
farewell
but
to
go
yet
was
it
very
strange
to
be
thus
near
and
to
show
such
behaviour
as
were
proper
to
one
afar
from
all
humanity
but
so
it
was
that
i
ordered
my
ways
for
it
did
seem
proper
to
me
yet
was
i
happy
to
know
that
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
must
time
and
oft
have
spied
upon
me
through
the
great
spyglass
and
mayhaps
did
watch
me
in
that
moment
and
it
grew
in
me
that
i
did
act
weakly
to
hold
off
from
mine
vittles
and
showed
foolishness
before
my
kind
friend
afar
and
i
did
ope
my
scrip
and
take
therefrom
three
tablets
the
which
i
chewed
and
did
eat
for
this
was
a
strong
food
treated
that
it
had
but
small
bulk
yet
were
they
not
filling
to
the
belly
and
i
made
that
i
would
drink
well
that
i
might
feel
that
something
was
therein
and
to
this
end
i
shook
from
a
strong
and
especial
tube
a
dust
and
i
caught
the
dust
within
a
little
cup
and
the
air
did
make
an
action
upon
that
dust
as
it
were
of
chemistry
and
the
dust
did
boil
and
make
a
fizzing
in
the
cup
and
rose
up
and
filled
it
with
a
liquid
that
was
of
simple
water
yet
very
strange
to
see
come
that
way
but
ordinary
after
a
time
and
in
this
way
as
might
be
seen
had
i
such
food
and
drink
in
but
a
little
scrip
that
might
keep
life
within
me
for
a
great
time
yet
was
it
a
way
of
discomfort
and
lacking
to
the
mouth
and
to
the
belly
but
a
sufficient
thing
unto
the
need
of
the
body
and
good
matter
for
a
thankful
heart
in
that
dark
and
hungry
land
now
when
i
had
eaten
i
did
go
over
in
their
order
those
things
which
i
did
carry
for
there
was
beside
the
diskos
and
that
scrip
of
food
a
pouch
that
did
contain
matters
various
and
these
i
did
look
into
and
afterward
did
take
out
a
small
compass
that
i
had
been
give
by
the
master
monstruwacan
so
that
i
might
find
of
its
workings
without
the
great
redoubt
and
he
had
said
unto
me
that
it
might
be
that
i
should
pass
far
off
into
the
night
land
and
lose
the
mighty
pyramid
amid
so
great
a
country
and
so
plentiful
a
darkness
then
perchance
if
that
ancient
principle
did
still
lurk
within
the
machine
though
turned
no
more
to
the
north
but
unto
the
pyramid
then
should
it
guide
my
feet
homeward
out
of
the
everlasting
night
and
thus
have
once
more
that
ancient
use
which
as
i
do
know
is
common
unto
this
age
and
this
was
a
very
cunning
thing
to
have
with
me
if
but
it
held
service
to
the
earthcurrent
and
a
rare
thing
which
the
master
monstruwacan
did
make
with
his
own
hands
and
much
skill
and
pains
from
an
olden
one
that
had
place
within
the
great
museum
and
concerning
which
i
have
told
somewhat
before
this
place
and
i
set
the
thing
upon
the
ground
but
it
had
no
certain
way
with
it
but
did
spin
and
waver
constantly
and
this
i
made
to
consider
and
remembered
that
i
was
yet
above
that
part
where
afar
in
the
earth
did
spread
the
greatness
of
the
underground
fields
and
i
was
haply
but
a
little
way
off
from
the
crack
though
a
mighty
way
above
and
it
pleasured
me
to
wonder
whether
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
did
behold
how
that
i
made
test
with
the
compass
for
the
light
was
good
from
the
firehole
and
the
great
spyglass
had
a
great
strength
yet
had
i
no
certainty
for
as
i
did
know
from
much
watchings
there
was
no
surety
in
the
searching
of
the
land
by
the
glass
for
there
was
oft
plainness
where
you
did
think
surely
none
should
see
and
anon
a
dullness
where
might
be
thought
that
the
sight
went
gaily
and
this
may
be
plain
to
all
for
the
wavering
of
the
lights
from
the
strange
fires
was
not
to
be
accounted
to
rule
but
made
a
light
here
and
a
darkness
there
and
then
did
change
about
oddly
moreover
there
were
smokes
and
mists
that
did
come
upwards
from
the
earth
in
this
place
and
in
that
and
had
somewhiles
a
greatness
but
oft
were
small
and
did
lurk
low
and
had
no
power
but
to
confuse
the
sight
and
presently
i
did
put
by
the
compass
in
my
pouch
and
made
to
compose
myself
unto
sleep
but
here
would
i
now
set
down
how
that
in
the
end
after
i
had
gone
many
days
journeyings
outward
from
the
mighty
pyramid
i
did
indeed
find
it
to
draw
the
northward
part
of
the
needle
unto
it
and
this
was
a
comfort
and
a
pleasure
to
my
spirit
moreover
if
ever
i
did
get
back
as
i
did
think
it
would
be
a
matter
for
great
interest
unto
the
master
monstruwacan
yet
in
verity
were
there
other
matters
that
should
hold
him
more
for
he
was
right
human
as
all
should
know
and
moreover
concerning
this
same
compass
i
did
find
a
fresh
thing
for
after
a
yet
greater
time
as
i
shall
set
out
in
a
due
place
if
i
do
but
remember
which
doubt
is
ever
my
fear
to
fret
me
i
came
a
mighty
way
from
the
redoubt
and
lo
fearing
that
i
might
indeed
lose
that
my
great
home
in
the
darkness
of
the
world
i
did
pull
out
that
strange
wonder
of
the
needle
that
i
might
have
comfort
by
its
homeward
pointing
and
i
did
discover
a
new
power
in
the
night
for
the
machine
did
point
no
more
directwards
unto
the
great
redoubt
but
was
a
point
unto
the
westwards
so
that
i
had
knowledge
that
some
great
power
afar
in
the
darkness
of
the
world
did
sway
upon
it
and
i
had
a
childlike
wonder
that
this
might
be
in
truth
that
same
power
of
the
north
of
which
the
books
and
my
memorydreams
did
tell
and
indeed
no
doubt
should
there
be
upon
this
matter
yet
who
might
not
have
doubt
in
that
time
that
they
should
perceive
after
an
eternity
that
ancient
northward
force
swaying
that
small
servant
unto
an
olden
obedience
and
it
was
as
it
were
a
revealing
unto
me
how
that
to
know
within
the
brain
is
one
matter
but
to
have
knowledge
within
the
heart
is
another
for
i
had
always
known
concerning
this
northward
force
but
yet
had
not
known
with
the
true
meaning
of
knowledge
and
yet
one
other
matter
there
was
to
cause
doubt
at
that
moment
of
this
new
knowing
for
it
came
to
me
that
maybe
the
power
of
that
lesser
redoubt
did
begin
to
act
upon
the
machine
even
as
the
earthcurrent
of
the
great
pyramid
did
hold
yet
a
strong
drawing
upon
the
needle
and
were
this
so
then
did
i
not
surely
begin
to
stand
anigh
unto
my
journeys
end
for
that
less
power
of
the
lesser
redoubt
could
have
no
impudence
to
pull
save
that
i
had
come
to
a
closeness
with
it
yet
in
truth
as
i
do
now
have
knowledge
it
was
the
north
that
drew
and
i
do
seem
to
make
a
great
telling
about
this
little
matter
but
how
else
shall
i
show
to
you
mine
inward
mind
and
the
lack
of
knowledge
and
likewise
the
peculiar
knowings
that
did
go
to
the
making
of
that
time
and
the
peoples
thereof
which
is
but
to
say
the
same
thing
twice
over
and
now
as
i
did
say
i
made
to
compose
myself
for
sleep
and
to
this
end
i
took
a
cloakmatter
which
did
cross
my
shoulder
and
hip
and
wrapt
it
about
me
and
lay
down
there
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
by
that
strange
firehole
and
i
lay
the
diskos
beside
me
within
the
cloak
for
it
was
indeed
my
companion
and
friend
in
bitter
need
so
that
i
had
pleasure
to
feel
the
strange
thing
anigh
to
me
and
as
i
did
lie
there
in
those
moments
that
do
drowse
the
soul
as
it
were
that
they
do
proceed
as
breath
out
of
the
mouth
of
sleep
i
had
a
halfknowing
that
the
aether
did
surge
about
me
and
i
doubt
not
but
that
there
had
watched
my
every
doing
many
of
the
millions
and
had
been
humanly
stirred
at
my
commending
of
my
spirit
unto
sleep
and
thus
did
shake
the
aether
of
the
world
about
me
with
their
unity
of
sympathy
and
mayhaps
i
had
some
little
knowing
of
this
thing
as
i
did
pass
drowsy
into
slumber
and
it
is
surely
like
that
i
slept
the
better
for
it
moreover
i
was
wondrous
tired
and
worn
and
thus
did
sleep
very
strong
and
heavy
yet
i
mind
me
that
my
last
dim
thinkings
were
upon
that
sweet
maid
i
did
go
to
find
and
in
slumber
did
i
have
speech
with
her
in
dreams
and
a
strange
happiness
about
me
and
all
seeming
to
be
touched
by
fairylight
and
freed
from
the
sorrow
of
life
and
it
was
from
a
sweet
and
lovely
sleeping
such
as
this
that
i
was
waked
suddenly
by
a
great
and
mighty
sound
and
i
came
instant
to
a
possessing
of
my
senses
and
i
knew
that
the
mighty
voice
of
the
homecall
did
go
howling
across
the
night
and
swift
and
silent
i
slid
the
cloak
from
about
me
and
took
the
haft
of
that
wondrous
diskos
into
mine
hand
and
i
did
look
towards
the
pyramid
quickly
for
a
message
for
i
had
a
sure
knowledge
that
there
had
a
great
need
arisen
and
that
some
terror
came
towards
me
out
of
the
dark
else
they
had
never
waked
all
the
night
land
to
a
knowing
that
an
human
was
abroad
out
of
the
mighty
refuge
and
even
as
i
did
peer
towards
the
great
redoubt
i
could
not
abide
to
keep
my
gaze
entire
that
way
but
did
take
a
large
and
fearful
look
all
about
me
yet
could
make
to
see
nothing
and
so
did
stare
eager
and
anxious
afar
into
the
upper
blackness
of
the
night
where
did
shine
that
final
light
of
the
tower
of
observation
and
the
same
while
crouched
and
holding
the
diskos
and
making
to
glance
across
my
shoulders
and
to
watch
for
the
message
and
all
in
the
same
moment
and
then
afar
upwards
in
the
prodigious
height
i
did
see
the
great
and
bright
and
quick
darting
flashes
of
a
strange
green
fire
and
did
know
that
they
spelled
to
me
in
the
setspeech
a
swift
warning
that
a
grey
monster
that
was
a
great
grey
man
had
made
scent
of
me
in
the
dark
and
was
even
in
that
moment
of
time
crawling
towards
me
through
the
low
mossbushes
that
lay
off
beyond
the
firehole
to
my
back
and
the
message
was
sharp
and
bade
me
to
leap
into
the
bushes
unto
my
left
and
to
hide
there
so
that
i
might
chance
to
take
the
thing
to
an
advantage
and
as
may
be
thought
they
had
scarce
flashed
the
tale
unto
me
but
i
was
gone
in
among
the
shadows
of
a
clump
of
the
mossbush
that
did
grow
anigh
and
i
sweat
with
a
strange
terror
and
a
cold
and
excited
shaking
of
the
heart
yet
was
my
spirit
set
strong
to
conquer
and
lo
as
i
did
crouch
there
hidden
i
saw
something
come
very
quiet
out
of
the
bushes
that
did
grow
beyond
the
firehole
and
it
was
great
and
crept
and
was
noways
coloured
but
by
greyness
in
all
its
parts
and
the
glare
from
the
firehole
did
seem
to
trouble
it
so
that
it
looked
laying
its
head
to
the
ground
and
spying
along
the
earth
in
a
strange
and
brutish
fashion
that
it
might
oversee
the
glare
of
the
firehole
yet
i
doubt
that
it
saw
beyond
the
fire
with
plainness
for
in
a
moment
it
crept
swift
in
among
the
bushes
again
and
came
out
towards
the
edge
of
the
firehole
in
another
place
and
this
it
did
thrice
unto
my
left
and
thrice
unto
my
right
and
every
time
did
lay
its
head
to
the
earth
and
spy
along
and
did
hunch
its
shoulders
and
thrust
forward
the
jaw
horridly
and
turn
the
neck
as
a
very
nasty
beast
might
go
wanton
now
as
you
may
think
this
manner
of
the
beastman
did
shake
my
courage
mightily
for
i
did
think
each
time
that
it
did
go
inward
among
the
mossbushes
that
it
had
made
discovery
of
me
and
would
make
to
take
me
in
the
back
from
out
of
the
dark
of
the
bushes
and
this
was
an
uncomfortable
thing
to
consider
as
others
might
think
also
had
any
been
there
in
the
bush
with
me
and
then
in
truth
did
that
same
swift
sense
of
mine
hearing
prove
helpful
to
my
saving
for
behold
the
thing
did
go
back
into
the
mossbushes
after
that
last
coming
out
and
did
seem
to
make
as
it
had
made
a
failing
to
discover
me
and
had
no
further
intent
save
to
return
unto
the
night
and
i
had
this
thought
truly
in
mine
heart
and
for
maybe
a
minute
and
then
lo
within
my
soul
a
voice
did
speak
plain
and
did
warn
me
that
the
thing
did
make
a
great
compass
among
the
mossbushes
about
the
firehole
having
made
discovery
of
me
and
it
did
go
warily
to
take
me
in
the
back
from
the
other
side
now
when
i
heard
this
voice
speak
within
my
spirit
i
had
knowledge
that
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
made
watch
from
the
tower
of
observation
and
did
send
the
speech
with
his
brainelements
having
in
mind
that
i
had
the
nighthearing
and
i
trusted
the
speech
for
in
the
same
moment
of
time
there
did
beat
all
about
me
in
the
night
the
solemn
throb
of
the
masterword
as
that
it
had
been
added
with
speed
to
give
instant
assurance
and
i
leapt
quick
from
that
clump
of
the
mossbush
unto
another
and
crouched
and
made
a
watch
all
about
me
and
kept
the
ears
of
my
spirit
open
knowing
that
the
master
monstruwacan
did
also
watch
all
for
me
and
suddenly
i
saw
a
little
moving
of
a
bush
that
grew
to
the
back
of
those
bushes
in
which
i
had
been
hid
and
there
came
out
of
the
bush
that
moved
a
great
grey
hand
and
moved
the
moss
of
the
clump
where
i
had
been
as
it
were
that
something
peered
out
of
the
moving
bush
and
there
followed
the
great
grey
head
of
the
grey
man
and
the
head
went
into
the
clump
of
the
mossbush
where
i
had
been
and
i
knew
that
i
must
strike
now
and
i
leapt
and
smote
with
the
diskos
and
the
thing
fell
upon
its
side
and
the
great
grey
legs
came
out
of
the
hither
bushes
and
twitched
and
drew
upwards
but
the
head
remained
in
the
bush
where
i
had
been
hid
and
i
stood
away
from
the
thing
whilst
it
died
and
in
mine
hand
the
diskos
did
spin
and
send
forth
fire
as
it
were
that
it
did
live
and
did
know
that
it
had
slain
a
great
and
horrid
monster
and
presently
the
grey
man
was
dead
and
i
went
away
from
those
bushes
unto
the
far
side
of
the
firehole
and
i
stood
with
the
diskos
held
high
and
spinning
and
sending
out
fire
that
they
within
the
mighty
pyramid
might
know
that
i
had
slain
the
beastman
for
it
might
be
that
it
lay
too
much
in
the
shadow
for
them
to
look
upon
but
the
master
monstruwacan
spoke
not
again
to
me
for
indeed
it
was
not
meet
to
do
so
except
it
might
save
me
from
a
sure
danger
for
as
you
may
know
from
my
past
tellings
there
were
powers
of
the
night
land
that
did
hearken
unto
such
matters
and
it
was
like
enough
that
there
had
been
overmuch
done
even
thus
for
my
further
safety
yet
the
thing
could
not
be
helped
and
now
that
i
was
a
little
calmed
and
eased
from
my
fear
i
could
know
that
all
that
the
aether
of
the
night
was
disturbed
by
the
gladness
of
the
millions
within
the
great
redoubt
so
that
it
was
plain
how
great
a
multitude
had
given
note
unto
the
fight
and
their
hearts
to
beat
in
sweet
sympathy
and
natural
fear
so
that
i
did
feel
companied
and
befriended
though
as
it
may
be
thought
something
shaken
yet
about
the
heart
now
in
a
little
time
i
did
gather
unto
me
my
wits
and
had
myself
to
order
and
i
looked
to
see
how
the
hours
did
go
and
i
found
that
i
had
surely
slumbered
through
ten
hours
and
i
reproached
myself
for
indeed
i
had
slept
oversound
by
reason
of
my
having
lacked
a
regular
way
and
time
as
i
had
with
a
proper
wisdom
made
to
be
my
rule
and
i
resolved
that
i
would
obey
the
wit
of
my
reason
in
all
the
future
time
and
make
to
eat
and
rest
in
due
season
as
you
will
wot
that
i
did
before
intend
then
with
a
selfreproachful
heart
i
went
around
the
small
firehole
and
caught
up
my
cloak
and
other
matters
and
i
turned
me
towards
the
mighty
pyramid
and
did
look
once
upwards
along
all
the
great
slope
where
it
did
go
measureless
into
the
far
blackness
of
the
everlasting
night
and
i
made
no
salutation
for
i
had
so
resolved
as
you
will
know
moreover
i
desired
not
to
call
forth
any
unneedful
disturbance
of
the
aether
of
the
world
which
indeed
must
be
did
i
make
to
stir
the
emotions
of
the
millions
and
i
turned
me
then
away
and
went
off
into
the
night
going
swift
and
cautious
and
bearing
the
diskos
cunningly
and
almost
as
it
were
with
a
love
for
that
strange
and
wondrous
weapon
that
had
so
befriended
me
and
slain
the
foul
grey
man
with
one
stroke
and
i
had
feeling
that
it
did
know
me
and
had
a
comradeship
for
me
and
i
doubt
none
will
understand
this
save
it
might
be
they
of
the
olden
days
that
did
carry
one
strong
sword
always
yet
was
the
diskos
more
than
the
sword
for
it
did
in
truth
seem
to
live
with
the
fire
and
the
flame
of
the
earthcurrent
that
did
beat
within
it
and
it
was
well
acknowledged
within
the
great
redoubt
that
none
might
touch
the
diskos
of
another
for
that
the
thing
went
crustily
as
it
might
be
said
in
the
hands
of
a
stranger
and
if
any
made
foolishness
of
this
knowledge
and
did
persist
much
to
such
an
handling
or
making
to
use
the
same
would
presently
act
clumsy
with
the
weapon
and
come
to
an
hurt
and
this
was
a
sure
thing
and
had
been
known
maybe
an
hundred
thousand
years
or
perchance
a
greater
time
and
by
this
it
doth
seem
wise
to
believe
that
there
did
grow
always
an
affinity
between
the
nature
of
the
manwhich
doth
as
ever
include
the
womanand
the
diskos
that
he
did
use
in
his
practice
and
because
of
this
known
thing
and
that
the
place
would
elsewise
be
lumbered
with
olden
weapons
of
those
that
did
die
it
was
a
law
and
usage
that
there
was
placed
with
the
dead
the
diskos
of
the
dead
there
upon
the
last
road
in
the
country
of
silence
and
was
thus
made
to
give
back
unto
the
earthcurrent
the
power
that
did
lie
in
it
and
this
doth
seem
to
a
careless
thinker
as
it
were
that
i
told
once
again
those
olden
customs
of
the
ancient
folk
but
this
is
otherwise
and
had
a
sound
reason
to
it
yet
if
you
do
so
believe
i
doubt
not
but
that
a
right
human
sentiment
was
something
at
the
bottom
which
is
proper
for
it
is
meet
that
love
should
mate
with
wisdom
to
mother
comfort
in
our
sorrows
and
it
is
a
warm
thing
to
do
aught
for
our
dead
and
none
may
say
nay
to
this
now
as
i
did
go
onwards
into
the
night
land
looking
ever
to
this
shadow
and
to
that
it
may
be
conceived
how
my
heart
would
stir
with
swift
fear
at
this
and
that
and
that
my
body
would
oft
quiver
to
leap
aside
and
as
swift
discover
that
naught
assailed
and
so
did
i
go
forward
and
always
with
imaginings
and
wonders
concerning
what
manner
of
uncouth
being
or
brute
might
come
out
of
the
darknesses
all
about
yet
in
all
that
time
there
was
a
certain
proudness
of
the
heart
that
i
did
come
safe
out
of
the
power
of
the
grey
man
and
did
surely
slay
him
but
truly
it
were
well
that
the
praise
be
considered
and
not
overmuch
given
unto
me
for
i
had
died
as
i
slept
but
that
they
of
the
great
redoubt
had
made
a
watch
over
me
and
waked
me
unto
my
saving
now
presently
as
i
walked
i
grew
something
faint
and
had
knowledge
that
i
did
foolishly
for
indeed
i
should
have
eat
after
my
fight
yet
may
i
be
forgiven
for
this
forgetting
in
that
i
had
been
much
shaked
and
put
about
and
i
sat
me
down
in
a
little
clear
place
among
the
bushes
and
did
eat
three
of
the
tablets
and
did
once
more
shake
forth
the
dust
that
did
turn
in
the
air
to
a
natural
water
by
a
proper
and
natural
chemistry
of
these
matters
and
after
i
had
eat
i
sat
a
little
while
and
did
think
and
did
look
upwards
at
the
great
slope
of
the
pyramid
in
the
night
and
all
the
time
did
i
listen
with
mine
ears
and
with
my
spirit
and
kept
the
diskos
across
my
knees
and
looked
this
way
and
that
very
frequent
but
nothing
came
anigh
and
so
i
rose
presently
and
went
onwards
and
walked
for
six
hours
towards
the
north
and
the
west
and
i
made
much
to
the
west
for
a
little
that
i
might
come
clear
of
the
northwest
watcher
yet
after
a
space
i
made
to
do
foolishly
for
i
changed
my
mind
about
and
kept
something
more
towards
the
north
so
that
i
should
have
a
surer
sight
of
that
monster
and
this
was
in
truth
a
rash
and
naughty
thing
to
consider
for
if
i
were
but
seen
then
should
that
grim
brute
make
a
signal
unto
the
evil
powers
and
i
be
met
swiftly
with
destruction
but
surely
the
heart
is
a
strange
and
wayward
thing
and
given
to
quick
fears
and
immediately
unto
great
and
uncountable
rashnesses
and
so
i
did
go
forward
unwisely
to
the
northward
of
a
safe
and
proper
going
and
it
may
be
that
an
influence
was
upon
me
and
drew
me
thatwards
but
who
shall
say
now
a
great
time
i
walked
and
made
a
halt
upon
every
sixth
hour
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
look
a
little
unto
the
monstrous
towering
of
the
great
redoubt
and
afterwards
make
strong
mine
heart
and
go
forward
again
and
always
i
did
go
warily
and
chiefly
among
the
low
mossbush
but
sometimes
out
upon
stony
ground
and
oft
across
places
where
sulphur
did
puff
somewhat
from
the
ground
in
a
low
smoke
very
strong
in
the
nostrils
and
not
liked
inwardly
and
as
i
made
onwards
i
looked
always
to
my
right
and
to
my
left
and
anon
to
the
rear
yet
made
a
constant
observation
of
the
mighty
watcher
that
i
did
begin
to
draw
nigh
unto
and
oft
did
i
stoop
to
crawl
and
my
hands
did
bleed
somewhat
but
after
i
was
troubled
so
i
put
on
the
great
gloves
that
made
complete
the
grey
armour
and
so
was
shod
proper
to
such
journeying
and
presently
when
eighteen
hours
did
have
passed
since
that
my
sudden
awakening
to
the
peril
of
the
grey
man
i
did
search
about
for
a
place
to
slumber
for
i
would
keep
wisely
unto
my
ruling
and
go
not
over
long
lacking
of
sleep
and
by
this
planning
i
should
be
the
less
like
to
sleep
oversound
and
so
should
set
my
spirit
to
listen
whilst
i
did
sleep
and
by
so
much
as
my
spirit
should
serve
me
with
faith
should
i
have
safety
and
this
thing
is
plain
and
wants
not
more
to
the
saying
thereof
and
i
came
presently
unto
a
sudden
place
where
the
land
did
go
downwards
brokenly
as
that
it
had
been
burst
a
great
while
gone
by
the
inward
fires
and
i
looked
downwards
over
the
edge
of
that
place
and
went
round
about
it
and
did
see
presently
a
ledge
upon
the
far
side
that
was
difficult
to
come
upon
yet
a
place
of
some
little
safety
to
any
that
might
go
down
to
it
for
it
was
awkward
to
see
and
did
any
monster
seek
to
come
at
me
i
should
have
chance
of
warning
and
might
go
downwards
a
greater
way
in
time
to
my
salvation
and
by
this
determination
i
abode
and
came
down
to
that
place
with
labour
but
was
cheerful
of
heart
that
i
had
found
so
sure
a
shelter
and
i
eat
my
three
tablets
and
drank
the
water
that
i
did
get
from
the
powder
and
so
made
to
compose
my
body
to
sleep
yet
at
this
time
a
thought
did
come
to
me
and
i
made
calculation
afresh
and
laughed
somewhat
at
that
my
poor
counting
for
indeed
i
had
thought
to
eat
but
thrice
in
the
twenty
and
four
hours
yet
by
my
arranging
i
was
made
indeed
to
eat
four
times
as
you
shall
see
immediately
by
a
little
thought
and
this
thing
came
more
strong
upon
my
spirit
than
any
might
think
for
i
did
eat
overmuch
for
the
lasting
of
the
food
though
in
verity
it
was
but
little
to
my
belly
as
you
must
all
think
and
have
sympathy
for
my
discomfort
and
i
considered
a
little
and
had
determined
that
i
should
afterwards
in
my
journeying
eat
but
two
of
the
tablets
to
my
meal
and
this
was
a
wise
thought
and
like
much
wisdom
a
discomposing
thing
but
so
it
was
and
i
set
it
down
that
you
may
know
the
arranging
of
my
ways
at
that
time
now
in
all
this
while
of
meditation
i
had
been
setting
my
cloak
about
me
and
was
fast
set
to
my
sleeping
for
i
had
walked
a
weary
way
and
i
lay
me
down
upon
my
left
side
with
my
back
to
the
rock
which
did
overhang
me
something
above
so
that
i
was
contented
to
feel
hid
from
things
that
might
pass
by
in
the
night
and
i
had
the
cloak
about
me
and
the
diskos
close
against
my
breast
within
the
cloak
and
my
head
upon
my
pouch
and
upon
my
scrip
and
as
i
lay
thus
a
moment
easeful
i
could
see
that
so
mighty
was
the
uprising
of
the
great
pyramid
that
it
was
not
hid
from
me
even
thus
but
did
stand
upward
into
the
night
and
did
shine
and
was
plain
to
be
seen
above
the
further
edge
of
that
deep
place
where
i
did
lie
and
i
fell
upon
sleep
looking
upward
at
that
final
light
where
as
might
be
the
master
monstruwacan
did
bend
the
great
spyglass
upon
my
lonesomeness
as
i
lay
there
upon
the
ledge
and
this
was
a
thought
of
sweet
comfort
upon
which
to
slumber
the
which
i
did
but
my
spirit
lay
wakeful
within
my
breast
and
did
listen
through
the
night
and
harked
for
all
evil
matters
and
things
that
did
make
to
come
anigh
but
also
my
spirit
did
whisper
unto
naani
as
i
went
into
sleep
and
so
passed
i
into
dreams
now
it
may
be
thought
that
i
did
act
with
a
strange
valiance
in
that
i
composed
my
body
so
properly
to
slumber
and
with
but
a
little
trouble
of
the
heart
concerning
the
coming
of
monsters
and
in
truth
this
hath
seemed
somewhat
so
to
me
thinking
since
that
time
but
i
do
but
set
the
thing
that
is
truth
and
make
not
to
labour
to
an
illusion
of
truth
and
so
must
tell
much
that
doth
seem
improper
to
the
reality
yet
must
all
bear
with
me
and
have
understanding
of
the
hardness
of
setting
forth
with
true
seeming
the
honesty
of
truth
which
in
verity
is
better
served
oft
times
by
timely
and
cunning
lies
and
so
shall
you
understand
this
matter
so
well
as
i
and
presently
my
spirit
waked
me
there
in
the
half
dark
of
the
night
land
and
i
looked
swift
about
me
and
upwards
and
saw
nothing
to
fear
then
did
i
peer
at
my
dial
and
made
to
discover
that
i
had
slept
full
over
six
quiet
hours
and
by
this
i
knew
the
reason
of
mine
awaking
for
it
was
so
great
impressed
upon
me
by
mine
inward
sense
and
being
and
this
you
shall
understand
someways
who
have
thought
ere
sleep
to
wake
to
a
certain
time
of
the
morning
and
by
understanding
shall
you
believe
and
give
me
all
your
kind
harking
and
human
sympathy
and
i
made
to
have
a
smartness
of
going
which
is
ever
hard
to
the
newly
waked
and
i
eat
two
tablets
the
while
my
belly
did
cry
out
for
an
wholesome
and
proper
filling
but
i
drank
some
of
the
water
and
so
did
ease
somewhat
of
my
hunger
then
did
i
wind
my
cloak
to
its
shape
and
put
upon
me
my
gear
which
was
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
the
diskos
to
my
hip
and
i
clomb
out
from
that
place
of
rest
yet
before
i
did
come
rightly
up
into
the
open
i
peered
about
and
made
some
surety
that
no
evil
brute
was
anigh
and
then
i
gat
me
out
and
stood
upon
my
feet
and
looked
for
a
little
upwards
at
the
mighty
slope
of
the
great
redoubt
which
did
seem
yet
very
nigh
unto
me
by
reason
of
it
being
so
monstrous
in
bigness
and
i
wondered
whether
in
that
moment
the
master
monstruwacan
did
look
down
upon
me
with
the
great
spyglass
and
afterwards
i
turned
away
swiftly
and
went
on
into
the
night
land
for
it
did
always
make
me
shaken
with
lonesomeness
to
look
upon
my
great
home
and
so
i
did
go
forward
with
a
strong
and
uncaring
stride
but
grew
presently
to
quietness
and
to
have
back
the
proper
caution
of
my
going
yet
had
i
not
gone
all
foolishly
for
i
had
taken
the
diskos
from
my
hip
ere
this
so
that
i
possessed
it
handily
now
there
is
one
matter
which
shall
seem
but
a
small
and
natural
occurring
unto
you
yet
was
strong
upon
me
in
that
time
and
this
thing
was
that
i
did
begin
now
to
see
the
night
land
from
the
new
outlooking
of
my
distance
from
the
mighty
pyramid
and
it
was
as
that
a
man
of
this
day
did
go
from
the
earth
to
travel
among
the
stars
and
lo
should
he
not
find
them
to
shift
upon
his
vision
so
that
the
great
bear
and
this
and
that
shaping
of
the
star
clusterings
should
make
a
new
order
as
he
did
wander
onwards
and
so
should
he
find
that
there
was
naught
that
was
truly
fixed
as
he
did
before
then
think
but
all
to
alter
according
unto
the
place
whence
the
looking
and
this
thing
shall
be
plain
unto
you
though
no
thought
be
put
to
the
matter
for
it
is
of
an
evident
verity
that
doth
need
not
argument
to
expound
and
so
shall
you
have
memory
of
me
there
awander
among
those
strange
shapings
and
wonders
of
that
grim
land
the
which
i
had
never
but
supposed
to
seem
but
as
my
memory
did
retain
them
from
the
lookings
of
all
my
life
within
the
great
redoubt
and
so
it
was
and
ever
there
did
this
thing
and
that
open
out
to
a
new
view
and
the
night
land
take
to
itself
a
constant
new
aspect
to
mine
eyes
which
had
never
until
that
time
had
but
the
one
fixed
vision
of
the
same
and
you
shall
understand
with
me
how
that
when
about
the
fourteenth
hour
of
that
days
travel
i
did
draw
very
nigh
unto
the
monstrous
watcher
of
the
northwest
it
did
seem
so
utter
strange
from
this
fresh
aspect
that
i
had
been
like
to
think
that
i
did
see
a
new
monster
for
in
truth
when
i
did
come
at
last
to
creep
to
within
a
mile
of
it
among
the
low
mossbushes
i
was
confounded
that
the
mighty
chin
did
come
forward
towards
the
great
redoubt
even
as
the
upward
part
of
a
vast
cliff
which
the
sea
doth
make
hollow
about
the
bottom
for
it
did
hang
out
into
the
air
above
the
glare
of
the
fire
from
the
red
pit
as
it
had
been
a
thing
of
rock
all
scored
and
beweathered
and
dull
red
and
seeming
burned
and
blasted
by
reason
of
the
bloody
shine
that
beat
upward
from
the
deep
of
the
red
pit
and
by
the
way
in
which
i
do
tell
upon
it
you
shall
know
that
i
did
surely
view
it
something
from
the
side
at
this
immediate
time
for
in
truth
it
was
then
that
i
did
draw
the
nearer
and
moreover
i
was
the
more
astonished
at
this
viewing
than
i
had
been
to
the
front
for
it
was
so
utter
strange
and
shapen
so
different
from
the
brute
that
did
hang
in
my
memory
and
a
great
time
i
did
lie
there
upon
my
belly
and
shaken
by
a
fear
of
the
beast
yet
emboldened
as
you
may
conceive
by
having
come
to
the
side
and
being
hopeful
in
my
heart
that
i
was
very
secure
within
so
great
a
shadow
and
the
thick
sheltering
of
the
mossbushes
and
surely
it
was
that
i
did
creep
more
nigh
the
while
that
i
did
look
for
presently
i
had
a
very
plain
seeing
of
the
great
monster
and
did
know
where
i
had
gotten
to
and
thereby
did
acknowledge
unto
myself
that
this
was
an
utter
foolishness
and
like
for
all
that
any
might
say
to
lead
unto
destruction
yet
as
all
must
know
there
was
the
first
fear
and
the
ceasing
of
this
fear
as
i
did
wot
that
i
was
so
little
a
thing
to
heed
out
there
in
the
shadows
and
presently
a
gaining
of
courage
and
the
prick
of
my
being
that
did
crave
to
see
clear
this
exceeding
wonder
and
so
was
i
come
close
more
or
less
having
gone
far
upon
my
hands
and
knees
yet
sometimes
to
pause
but
afterwards
on
again
now
by
this
nearness
i
was
the
more
truly
able
to
perceive
how
that
the
bulk
of
the
watcher
did
rise
up
into
the
night
like
a
hill
and
the
colour
was
mostly
black
save
and
indeed
where
it
did
face
to
the
red
shine
of
the
pit
and
concerning
this
i
have
done
telling
and
so
did
i
lie
there
and
stare
a
great
while
parting
a
small
hole
in
the
mossbushes
that
i
might
spy
through
the
same
and
the
thing
was
squat
there
and
might
have
root
within
the
earth
so
it
did
seem
to
mine
imaginings
as
i
did
stare
with
a
dumb
wonder
and
there
were
monstrous
warts
upon
the
thing
and
indents
and
a
mighty
ruggedness
and
lumpings
as
it
were
that
it
did
be
pimpled
with
great
boulders
that
were
inbred
within
that
monstrous
hide
and
where
the
shine
from
the
pit
of
red
fire
did
strike
upon
these
they
did
stand
out
into
the
darkness
away
from
the
skin
as
you
of
this
age
shall
see
mountains
of
the
moon
catch
a
bright
fire
from
the
sun
and
show
plain
upon
the
night
of
the
moon
now
as
i
have
set
down
i
did
lie
there
and
look
a
great
while
and
it
came
presently
to
me
that
there
was
unease
within
the
mighty
pyramid
among
the
millions
for
i
did
feel
the
aether
of
the
world
to
be
disturbed
by
their
distress
and
so
had
a
knowing
that
they
had
a
cunning
wareness
concerning
the
place
where
i
did
hide
among
the
mossbushes
and
the
thrilling
in
the
night
did
bring
a
wisdom
into
my
head
for
in
verity
as
i
have
said
this
was
a
foolish
matter
that
i
was
upon
and
i
gat
a
thought
that
the
watcher
might
have
an
awaredness
of
the
trouble
of
the
multitudes
and
indeed
for
all
that
i
did
know
it
had
a
full
knowledge
of
all
my
wandering
though
concerning
this
i
did
think
otherwise
truly
in
my
heart
as
is
a
most
human
and
proper
way
to
make
comfortable
the
spirit
where
doubt
can
have
no
ease
from
reason
and
i
made
that
i
would
go
backwards
to
a
good
distance
from
the
watcher
and
go
forward
again
upon
my
journeying
if
but
that
i
come
safe
from
so
unwise
an
adventuring
and
as
i
did
begin
to
return
it
was
to
me
as
that
all
my
senses
were
newly
awake
for
i
had
a
sudden
knowing
that
i
was
within
the
atmosphere
should
i
not
call
it
of
the
monster
and
i
gat
an
abrupt
and
horrid
shaking
of
the
spirit
for
i
did
feel
in
verity
that
my
soul
had
come
too
anigh
and
that
the
beast
had
a
sure
knowledge
concerning
me
yet
did
make
to
my
destruction
with
no
haste
but
after
that
way
and
fashion
that
did
seem
proper
unto
it
and
this
feeling
you
shall
understand
the
better
maybe
when
i
do
tell
that
it
was
to
me
as
that
the
air
all
about
me
was
full
of
a
quiet
and
steadfast
life
and
keen
intelligence
that
i
did
believe
to
come
forth
from
the
watcher
on
every
side
so
that
i
did
feel
as
one
already
within
the
gaze
of
some
great
and
evil
power
yet
though
i
had
a
great
terror
upon
me
i
made
no
foolish
haste
but
commanded
my
soul
to
courage
and
put
a
guard
upon
my
way
of
going
and
so
made
a
very
quiet
journey
for
maybe
two
full
miles
and
afterwards
did
allow
myself
something
more
of
haste
for
i
was
now
grown
easier
in
my
spirit
and
felt
apart
from
the
spirit
of
the
great
watcher
and
after
a
longer
while
i
did
leave
that
hill
of
watchfulness
to
my
rear
and
was
gone
onward
into
the
night
yet
as
may
be
known
with
a
vague
unease
and
trouble
to
my
heart
and
a
swift
and
frequent
turning
to
learn
surely
that
no
evil
thing
came
after
me
for
as
you
may
know
i
could
nowise
have
forgetting
concerning
that
great
quiet
life
which
did
seem
to
be
living
in
all
the
air
around
that
mighty
bulk
for
it
had
been
all
about
me
in
the
night
as
i
have
told
and
i
to
feel
that
i
had
been
surely
discovered
and
thus
shall
you
know
how
shaken
was
my
spirit
in
verity
now
presently
at
the
eighteenth
hour
of
that
days
travel
i
ceased
from
my
journeying
that
i
might
eat
and
drink
and
i
did
sit
a
little
while
and
looked
back
upon
the
strange
and
monstrous
thing
which
i
had
come
beyond
and
the
great
humped
back
and
vast
shoulders
of
the
watchingthing
rose
up
into
the
night
black
and
cumbrous
against
the
red
shine
of
the
pit
and
thus
as
you
shall
think
had
that
brute
looked
always
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
through
eternity
and
did
cease
not
from
watching
and
was
steadfast
and
silent
and
alone
and
none
did
understand
and
after
i
had
eat
and
drunk
some
of
the
water
i
went
onward
for
a
full
matter
of
six
hours
more
being
minded
to
have
no
sleep
until
i
had
put
a
great
way
between
me
and
the
watcher
and
in
this
part
of
my
journey
did
i
come
to
the
place
where
the
silent
ones
kill
as
it
was
named
in
the
maps
and
i
observed
a
very
wondrous
caution
and
went
away
from
it
a
little
unto
the
north
where
i
did
see
at
a
distance
the
shinings
of
fireholes
the
which
did
promise
me
warmth
through
my
slumber
and
here
you
must
know
that
the
place
where
the
silent
ones
kill
was
an
utter
bare
place
where
all
did
seem
of
rock
and
no
bush
did
seem
to
grow
thereon
so
that
a
man
might
not
come
to
any
hiding
though
in
truth
there
might
be
some
hole
here
or
there
yet
was
none
shown
in
any
map
within
the
pyramid
neither
did
there
seem
to
be
any
such
to
me
as
i
did
creep
there
among
the
mossbushes
to
the
northward
of
the
place
and
look
constant
and
fearful
towards
it
so
that
i
should
see
quickly
whether
any
silent
one
did
move
across
all
the
grey
quiet
of
that
rocky
plain
and
concerning
this
same
place
where
the
silent
ones
kill
it
were
well
to
make
an
explanation
how
that
there
was
always
a
little
and
farspreaded
light
over
all
that
lonesomeness
and
the
light
was
something
greyseeming
as
it
were
that
a
lichen
might
grow
upon
the
rocks
and
send
out
a
little
uncomfortable
glowing
even
as
certain
matters
do
in
these
times
if
you
do
but
know
the
place
and
the
time
to
seek
them
yet
was
the
light
exceeding
weak
and
very
cold
and
dismal
and
did
seem
truly
to
show
naught
with
a
sureness
so
that
it
did
appear
to
the
eye
if
one
did
look
fixedly
that
there
were
shadows
that
did
move
here
or
there
as
it
were
of
silent
beings
and
none
might
know
in
truth
whether
this
shaping
of
the
greyness
was
to
the
clouding
of
the
reason
or
that
the
eye
did
see
of
reality
yet
if
one
did
look
with
the
great
spyglass
then
might
there
be
some
surety
and
plainness
and
likewise
was
it
so
if
one
did
have
come
sufficient
anigh
to
that
uncomfortable
place
even
as
i
then
did
be
and
so
you
shall
conceive
how
that
i
did
slide
very
quiet
from
bush
unto
bush
for
i
had
alway
in
all
my
life
had
a
very
dread
fear
of
this
place
and
oft
did
i
peer
out
into
the
dim
grey
light
of
the
lonesome
plain
unto
my
left
and
would
think
sometimes
to
perceive
the
shapes
of
the
silent
ones
stood
vague
and
watchful
yet
on
the
instant
to
see
nothing
and
thus
i
did
go
onward
and
came
presently
to
a
part
where
the
grey
plain
did
stretch
out
a
bareness
into
the
night
land
to
my
front
so
that
my
way
ended
unless
i
did
make
a
long
passing
round
about
and
i
sat
there
among
the
mossbushes
and
did
consider
and
lookt
out
cunningly
through
a
spyhole
of
the
bush
in
which
i
did
sit
and
i
perceived
that
the
part
of
the
plain
which
did
jut
bareness
into
the
land
before
me
had
no
greatness
of
size
but
might
be
passed
swiftly
in
but
a
little
running
and
this
thing
should
save
me
a
wearisome
going
round
so
that
i
made
to
consider
it
with
a
serious
mind
and
all
the
time
did
i
search
the
bare
greyness
before
me
and
saw
presently
that
it
was
surely
empty
and
i
made
to
adventure
myself
across
running
very
swift
until
i
had
come
to
the
far
side
and
lo
as
i
did
go
to
rise
up
out
of
the
bush
mine
eyes
were
opened
as
it
were
and
i
saw
that
there
was
something
amid
the
constant
greyness
and
i
fell
quickly
into
the
bush
and
did
sweat
very
chill
but
yet
did
haste
to
look
and
i
saw
now
that
there
were
in
truth
matters
that
did
show
vague
upon
that
part
of
the
plain
that
was
before
me
and
i
did
peer
very
constant
and
anxious
and
behold
i
saw
that
there
was
facing
me
a
great
line
of
quiet
and
lofty
figures
shrouded
unto
their
feet
and
they
moved
not
neither
made
they
any
sound
but
stood
there
amid
the
greyness
and
did
seem
to
make
an
unending
watch
upon
me
so
that
my
heart
went
unto
weakness
and
i
did
feel
that
there
was
no
power
of
the
mossbushes
to
hide
me
for
in
verity
they
that
stood
so
silent
were
certain
of
the
silent
ones
and
i
was
very
nigh
to
the
place
of
destruction
now
i
moved
not
for
a
time
but
was
made
stiff
by
the
greatness
of
my
fear
yet
i
was
presently
aware
that
the
silent
ones
came
not
towards
me
but
stood
quiet
as
that
they
did
mind
not
to
slay
me
if
but
i
did
keep
from
that
place
and
there
grew
therefrom
a
little
courage
into
mine
heart
and
i
obeyed
my
spirit
and
took
an
hold
of
my
strength
and
went
slowly
backward
in
the
bushes
and
presently
i
was
come
a
long
way
off
yet
troubled
and
disturbed
and
very
strict
to
my
going
and
i
made
a
great
circling
about
that
place
where
the
plain
of
the
silent
ones
did
come
outward
and
so
did
gain
to
the
northwest
and
was
thence
something
the
happier
in
my
heart
and
went
easily
and
oft
upon
my
feet
yet
making
a
strong
watching
to
every
side
and
so
i
came
at
the
last
to
a
time
when
i
had
walked
through
fourandtwenty
weariful
hours
and
was
eager
that
i
should
come
to
a
safe
place
for
my
sleep
yet
did
lack
a
happy
belief
of
safety
in
that
i
had
come
twice
anigh
to
so
grim
trouble
and
unsure
i
was
that
i
did
not
be
secretly
pursued
in
the
night
and
this
you
shall
believe
to
be
a
very
desperate
feeling
and
a
plight
to
make
the
heart
sick
and
to
long
with
a
great
longing
for
the
safety
of
that
mine
home
yet
had
i
put
myself
to
the
task
and
truly
i
did
never
cease
to
the
sorrowful
remembering
of
that
utter
despair
that
had
sounded
to
me
plain
in
the
last
calling
of
mine
own
love
out
of
all
the
mystery
of
the
night
and
but
to
think
upon
this
was
to
grow
strong
in
the
spirit
yet
to
have
a
fresh
anxiousness
that
i
did
the
more
surely
keep
my
life
within
me
and
so
come
to
that
maids
salvation
now
as
you
shall
mind
i
had
spied
the
shine
of
certain
fireholes
somewhat
to
the
northward
and
had
thought
to
make
thereabouts
a
place
for
my
sleep
for
in
truth
there
was
a
bitterness
of
cold
in
all
the
air
of
night
that
did
surround
me
and
i
was
warmed
nigh
to
a
slow
happiness
by
thinking
upon
a
fire
to
lie
beside
and
small
wonder
as
you
shall
say
and
i
made
presently
a
strong
walking
unto
that
place
where
did
glow
in
the
night
the
shine
of
the
fireholes
as
i
did
well
judge
them
to
be
and
so
was
like
to
have
come
overswiftly
upon
my
death
as
you
shall
presently
see
for
as
i
came
anigh
to
the
first
i
perceived
that
the
light
came
upward
out
of
a
great
hollow
among
the
mossbushes
and
that
the
firehole
burned
somewhere
in
the
deep
of
the
hollow
so
that
i
did
but
look
upon
the
shine
thereof
yet
very
eager
was
i
to
come
to
that
warmth
and
i
made
more
of
haste
than
care
as
i
did
hint
and
so
came
very
swift
to
the
top
of
the
hollow
yet
was
still
hidden
by
the
kindness
of
the
mossbushes
and
as
i
made
to
thrust
forward
out
of
the
bushes
that
i
might
look
and
go
downward
into
the
hollow
there
rose
up
to
me
the
sound
of
a
very
large
voice
and
deep
and
husky
and
the
voice
was
a
dreadful
voice
that
did
speak
as
that
it
said
ordinary
things
and
in
a
fashion
so
monstrous
as
that
it
were
that
a
house
did
speak
and
in
verity
this
is
a
strange
thing
to
say
yet
shall
it
have
the
truth
of
my
feelings
and
terror
in
that
moment
and
i
drew
back
swiftly
from
discovering
myself
and
was
then
all
feared
to
move
or
to
make
to
go
more
backward
lest
that
i
should
give
knowledge
that
i
was
come
anigh
and
likewise
did
i
shiver
lest
that
i
was
even
then
perceived
and
so
shall
you
have
something
of
the
utter
fear
that
did
shake
me
and
i
abode
there
very
quiet
and
moved
not
for
a
very
great
space
but
did
sweat
and
shake
for
there
was
a
monstrous
horridness
in
the
voice
that
did
speak
and
as
i
crouched
there
within
the
mossbushes
there
came
again
the
large
voice
and
it
was
answered
by
a
second
voice
and
thereupon
there
arose
as
it
did
seem
the
speech
of
men
that
must
have
the
bigness
of
elephants
and
that
did
have
no
kindness
in
all
their
thoughts
but
were
utter
monstrous
and
the
speech
was
slow
and
it
rose
up
out
of
the
hollow
brutish
and
hoarse
and
mighty
and
i
would
that
i
could
make
you
to
hear
it
and
that
you
could
but
borrow
mine
ears
for
a
little
moment
and
forthwith
be
shaken
with
that
utter
horror
and
an
afraidness
even
as
was
i
now
presently
there
was
a
very
long
quiet
and
i
ceased
at
last
a
little
from
mine
overfear
and
later
i
did
calm
somewhat
so
that
i
made
to
shift
my
position
which
was
grown
very
uneasy
and
there
was
still
no
sound
from
the
hollow
wherefore
having
a
little
boldness
and
much
curiousness
and
these
despite
my
great
fearfulness
i
put
forth
mine
hand
very
cautious
and
did
move
the
mossbush
a
little
from
my
face
and
i
went
forward
upon
the
earth
and
did
lie
upon
my
belly
and
was
by
this
so
close
upon
the
edge
of
that
place
that
i
was
abled
to
look
downwards
and
you
shall
know
that
i
peered
down
into
that
great
hollow
and
did
see
a
very
strange
and
horrid
sight
for
in
truth
there
was
a
large
firehole
in
the
centre
of
that
place
and
all
about
the
sides
there
were
great
holes
into
the
slopes
of
the
hollow
and
there
were
great
men
laid
in
the
holes
so
that
i
might
see
a
great
head
that
did
show
out
to
my
sight
here
from
one
of
those
holes
and
would
seem
to
be
that
of
a
monstrous
man
heavy
with
sleep
and
there
i
would
see
but
the
buttocks
of
another
as
that
he
did
curl
himself
inward
to
his
brutish
slumbering
and
so
was
it
all
about
and
to
my
memory
there
were
maybe
a
score
of
these
holes
yet
had
i
not
time
to
the
counting
as
you
shall
see
for
after
that
i
had
made
but
a
glance
as
it
were
at
these
sleeping
and
utter
monstrous
men
i
perceived
that
there
sat
beyond
the
firehole
three
great
men
and
they
were
each
greater
than
elephants
and
covered
a
large
part
with
a
stiff
and
horrid
hair
that
did
be
of
a
reddish
seeming
and
there
were
upon
them
great
segs
and
warts
as
that
their
skin
had
been
hides
that
had
never
known
covering
and
there
was
between
them
the
body
of
a
mighty
hound
so
big
as
an
horse
that
they
did
skin
and
i
judged
that
this
beast
was
one
of
those
fearsome
brutes
which
we
did
call
the
night
hounds
yet
as
i
should
set
down
they
did
nothing
in
that
time
in
which
i
lookt
at
them
but
did
sit
each
with
a
sharp
and
monstrous
bloody
stone
in
his
fist
and
did
look
to
the
ground
as
that
they
heeded
not
the
earth
or
the
food
that
they
did
prepare
but
did
listen
to
some
outward
sound
and
you
shall
know
that
this
brought
to
me
a
very
swift
and
sudden
terror
for
i
perceived
now
the
why
of
their
long
silence
for
in
verity
they
had
an
unease
upon
them
being
subtly
aware
that
one
was
anigh
even
as
are
the
brute
beasts
in
this
manner
and
kind
as
all
do
know
and
i
made
to
draw
back
and
win
unto
safety
if
indeed
this
thing
were
to
be
done
and
as
i
moved
me
it
may
be
that
i
shook
a
little
earth
into
the
hollow
for
there
was
indeed
a
little
sifting
of
dry
dust
below
me
as
i
did
wot
being
very
keen
to
hear
by
reason
of
my
fright
and
immediately
did
those
three
monstrous
men
look
upward
and
did
seem
to
me
to
stare
into
mine
eyes
as
i
did
lie
there
hid
amid
the
mossbushes
and
i
was
so
put
in
fear
that
i
did
clumsily
and
sent
another
siftering
of
dust
downward
as
i
did
strive
to
go
backward
swift
and
quiet
from
the
edge
and
all
the
time
i
did
look
through
the
bushes
very
fixedly
into
the
eyes
of
the
giants
and
lo
their
eyes
did
shine
red
and
green
like
to
the
eyes
of
animals
and
there
rose
up
a
roar
from
them
that
did
nigh
slay
my
soul
with
the
horridness
of
the
noise
and
at
that
roaring
all
the
giants
that
did
lie
in
the
holes
did
awake
and
began
to
come
outward
into
the
hollow
now
i
was
surely
lost
and
given
over
to
destruction
for
they
had
possessed
me
immediately
but
that
in
that
moment
as
i
went
backward
the
earth
gave
behind
me
and
i
fell
into
a
hole
among
the
mossbushes
to
my
back
and
i
made
first
to
come
out
very
hurried
and
all
choked
with
a
dust
of
sand
and
ash
but
in
a
moment
i
was
sane
to
know
that
i
had
come
to
a
sudden
hidingplace
and
i
lay
very
still
and
strove
neither
to
cough
nor
to
breathe
and
well
for
me
i
came
to
so
close
a
hiding
for
there
were
all
about
me
the
sounds
of
monstrous
footsteps
running
that
seemed
to
shake
the
ground
though
maybe
this
to
be
an
imagining
bred
of
my
fear
and
shoutings
of
great
voices
there
were
and
the
thudding
of
huge
feet
all
about
and
the
noises
of
the
bushes
rustling
but
presently
the
search
drew
away
to
the
southward
and
i
perceived
that
there
had
surely
fought
for
me
some
power
of
good
fortune
and
i
came
up
out
of
the
hole
very
cautious
and
shaken
and
a
moment
weak
with
the
beating
of
my
heart
yet
with
a
lovely
thankfulness
for
my
salvation
and
i
gat
me
about
and
went
swift
through
the
mossbushes
to
the
north
and
west
for
three
hours
and
ceased
not
to
run
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
by
that
time
was
i
come
a
great
way
and
did
have
a
surety
in
my
heart
of
present
safety
and
i
ceased
to
run
and
lay
quiet
for
in
truth
i
did
near
swoon
away
with
the
hardness
of
my
travel
and
indeed
as
you
shall
know
i
had
slept
not
for
sevenandtwenty
hours
and
had
scarce
ceased
to
labour
in
all
that
time
moreover
i
had
eat
not
neither
drunk
for
nine
hours
and
so
shall
you
conceive
that
i
was
truly
aweary
and
presently
i
did
slumber
there
as
i
lay
and
all
abroad
to
any
monstrous
thing
that
should
come
along
yet
did
i
wake
unharmed
and
found
by
my
dial
there
had
gone
by
a
full
ten
hours
the
while
that
i
did
lie
there
and
sleep
unwotting
and
i
was
sore
perished
with
the
cold
of
the
night
for
i
had
not
the
warmth
of
my
cloak
about
me
and
my
belly
was
very
empty
and
i
stood
me
up
and
did
peer
about
for
any
dread
matter
but
all
seemed
proper
and
i
began
to
stamp
my
feet
against
the
earth
as
that
i
would
drive
it
from
me
and
this
i
do
say
as
a
whimsy
and
i
swung
mine
arms
as
often
you
shall
do
in
the
cold
days
and
so
i
was
presently
something
warmed
and
i
dismantled
my
cloak
and
wrapped
it
about
me
and
did
feel
that
the
diskos
was
safe
to
my
hip
then
did
i
sit
me
down
and
did
glow
a
little
with
relish
in
that
i
should
now
eat
four
of
the
tablets
for
indeed
these
were
my
proper
due
by
reason
of
my
shiftless
fasting
ere
i
came
so
wotless
to
my
slumbering
and
the
memory
of
that
eating
doth
live
with
me
now
so
that
i
could
near
to
smile
for
the
eagerness
of
mine
inwards
was
proper
and
human
yet
were
even
four
tablets
but
a
little
matter
to
so
great
an
emptyness
and
i
drank
a
double
portion
of
the
water
that
i
might
make
less
the
void
and
this
thing
was
seemly
for
indeed
there
were
two
portions
due
unto
me
and
when
i
had
eat
and
drunk
i
did
fold
the
cloak
once
more
to
shape
across
my
shoulder
as
i
did
carry
it
and
afterwards
i
took
the
diskos
into
my
hand
and
went
forward
again
to
the
north
and
west
yet
as
you
shall
know
i
did
pause
a
little
in
the
beginning
and
peer
to
every
side
for
any
close
danger
and
then
did
look
more
abroad
of
that
place
but
could
nowhere
see
any
matter
to
have
me
to
immediate
fear
and
afterwards
i
looked
a
little
while
at
the
monstrous
humped
back
of
the
watcher
of
the
northwest
and
it
did
grow
to
me
how
steadfast
that
thing
did
look
toward
the
mighty
pyramid
and
this
set
me
to
new
hatred
and
horror
of
the
monster
as
you
shall
conceive
and
believe
and
presently
i
looked
beyond
the
watcher
unto
the
vast
mountain
of
the
great
redoubt
and
i
was
still
seeming
close
upon
it
yet
in
truth
gone
a
long
and
weariful
distance
but
this
you
shall
understand
was
by
the
greatness
and
utter
height
and
bulk
of
that
shining
mountain
of
life
and
strange
and
wonderful
it
was
to
me
to
think
that
even
in
that
one
moment
it
might
be
that
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
did
look
upon
my
face
through
the
great
spyglass
and
i
should
not
seem
utter
far
to
him
by
reason
of
the
power
of
the
big
glass
but
to
me
as
i
did
look
upward
through
the
night
unto
that
far
and
utmost
light
in
the
upper
blackness
of
the
everlasting
gloom
it
did
seem
doubly
to
me
that
i
was
afar
off
and
lost
forever
from
mine
home
and
this
thinking
did
breed
in
me
such
a
great
and
lonesome
feeling
and
a
weakness
of
the
heart
and
spirit
that
forthwith
i
took
my
courage
close
unto
me
and
did
turn
away
quickly
and
went
onward
to
the
north
and
west
as
i
have
told
now
i
walked
for
twelve
hours
and
in
that
time
did
eat
and
drink
twice
and
made
onward
again
very
steadfast
and
happy
that
all
did
go
so
quiet
with
me
so
that
it
was
as
if
i
had
at
last
come
to
a
part
of
the
land
that
was
given
over
to
quietness
and
lacking
of
monsters
yet
in
truth
was
i
come
to
a
worse
place
than
any
maybe
for
as
i
went
forward
striding
very
strong
and
making
a
good
speed
i
did
hear
presently
a
little
noise
upward
in
the
night
and
someways
unto
my
left
that
had
seeming
as
that
it
were
a
strange
low
sound
that
did
come
down
to
me
out
of
an
hidden
doorway
above
for
indeed
though
the
sound
did
come
from
very
nigh
as
it
did
seem
no
more
than
a
score
feet
above
my
head
yet
was
it
a
noise
that
did
come
out
of
a
great
and
mighty
distance
and
out
of
a
foreign
place
and
i
did
know
the
sound
though
never
as
you
may
suppose
could
i
have
heard
it
in
all
my
life
yet
had
i
read
in
one
of
the
records
and
again
in
a
second
and
a
third
how
that
certain
of
all
they
that
had
adventured
from
the
pyramid
into
the
night
land
to
seek
for
knowledge
had
chanced
to
hear
a
queer
and
improper
noise
above
them
in
the
night
and
the
noise
had
been
strange
and
did
come
from
but
a
little
way
upward
in
the
darkness
yet
was
also
from
a
great
and
monstrous
distance
and
did
seem
to
moan
and
hum
quietly
and
to
have
a
different
sounding
from
all
noises
of
earth
and
in
the
records
it
was
set
forth
that
these
were
those
same
doorways
in
the
night
which
were
told
of
in
an
ancient
and
halfdoubted
tale
of
the
world
that
was
much
in
favour
of
the
children
of
the
pyramid
and
not
disdained
by
certain
of
our
wiser
men
and
had
been
thus
through
all
the
latter
ages
and
i
did
seem
to
know
the
sound
upon
the
moment
for
my
heart
grew
swift
to
understand
and
it
was
a
very
dread
uncomfortable
sound
and
you
shall
know
how
it
did
seem
if
you
will
conceive
of
a
strange
noise
that
doth
happen
far
away
in
the
country
and
the
same
noise
to
seem
to
come
to
you
through
an
opened
door
near
by
and
this
is
but
a
poor
way
to
put
it
yet
how
shall
i
make
the
thing
more
known
to
you
so
that
i
must
even
trust
unto
your
wit
and
true
sympathy
that
you
shall
conceive
of
the
fullness
of
my
meaning
now
in
all
the
histories
of
those
that
had
adventured
into
the
night
land
there
were
but
three
sure
records
that
did
concern
this
sound
and
each
did
tell
of
a
great
horror
and
of
them
that
did
hear
the
sound
there
had
died
the
most
part
out
in
the
night
land
and
the
records
did
make
always
that
they
had
come
upon
destruction
and
not
simply
unto
death
but
were
destroyed
by
a
strange
and
invisible
evil
power
from
the
night
and
of
those
that
came
alive
unto
the
pyramid
they
had
all
one
strange
tale
to
tell
how
that
there
were
secret
and
horrid
doorways
in
the
night
yet
how
this
thing
could
be
plain
to
them
who
may
know
truly
save
it
be
that
the
eyes
of
their
spirits
did
behold
that
which
was
hid
to
the
eyes
of
the
flesh
and
there
was
afterwards
writ
a
proper
and
careful
treatise
and
did
set
out
that
there
did
be
ruptures
of
the
aether
the
which
did
constitute
doorways
as
those
more
fanciful
ones
did
name
them
and
through
these
shatterings
which
might
be
likened
unto
openingsthere
being
no
better
word
to
their
namingthere
did
come
into
this
particular
condition
of
life
those
monstrous
forces
of
evil
that
did
dominate
the
night
and
which
many
did
hold
surely
to
have
been
given
this
improper
entrance
through
the
foolish
and
unwise
wisdom
of
those
olden
men
of
learning
that
did
meddle
overfar
with
matters
that
did
reach
in
the
end
beyond
their
understanding
and
this
thing
have
i
told
before
and
it
doth
seem
proper
unto
my
belief
for
it
is
always
thus
and
i
have
that
same
taint
within
me
as
must
all
that
have
the
zest
of
life
now
by
this
that
i
have
set
down
swiftly
to
make
a
little
clear
the
sure
horridness
of
this
sound
you
shall
know
even
with
me
the
great
horror
that
did
come
immediately
upon
my
spirit
and
i
did
know
that
my
search
was
surely
like
to
have
an
end
in
that
moment
and
i
bared
mine
arm
for
my
teeth
where
the
capsule
did
lie
below
the
skin
and
so
was
ready
to
an
instant
death
if
that
destruction
did
come
upon
me
and
in
the
same
moment
i
did
fall
silent
inward
among
the
mossbushes
and
did
begin
to
creep
very
quiet
toward
the
right
for
as
you
will
mind
i
had
heard
the
sound
over
beyond
my
left
and
all
that
time
as
i
did
creep
there
was
a
great
sickness
upon
me
and
it
did
seem
that
my
mouth
had
weakened
unto
water
so
that
i
could
scarce
hold
my
teeth
tightly
from
unseemly
clitterings
and
i
crept
always
very
silent
and
did
often
stare
quick
and
painful
over
my
shoulder
upwards
and
this
way
and
that
but
did
never
see
anything
neither
could
i
hear
now
the
sound
and
i
went
thiswise
for
a
great
hour
and
was
like
to
faint
through
the
effort
of
my
care
and
the
soreness
of
my
going
but
upon
the
end
of
that
long
while
i
grew
something
easier
in
the
spirit
and
did
perceive
that
i
was
saved
from
the
destruction
that
i
had
come
so
dreadful
anigh
and
this
thing
it
may
be
was
because
that
i
did
chance
to
hear
it
whilst
yet
it
was
beyond
and
before
i
did
come
right
unto
it
to
pass
below
yet
may
i
be
wrong
in
this
thought
and
do
but
make
a
guessing
but
as
i
shall
here
explain
after
that
time
i
kept
mine
ears
newly
keen
unto
hearing
and
did
chide
my
spirit
for
that
it
had
not
taken
account
of
that
sound
a
great
while
earlier
yet
as
i
did
presently
conceive
the
spirit
had
no
power
to
hear
that
thing
which
was
very
strange
but
truly
so
now
because
that
i
went
with
a
very
wary
hearing
i
heard
the
sound
once
a
far
way
off
before
me
and
i
hid
upon
the
moment
and
went
backward
and
after
a
while
did
judge
myself
to
have
come
unto
safety
and
so
it
was
in
verity
for
i
heard
no
more
that
time
and
so
did
i
come
presently
unto
the
eighteenth
hour
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
made
me
a
place
of
slumber
in
a
little
hollow
of
a
rock
that
stood
upward
out
of
the
mossbushes
and
i
slept
for
six
hours
and
afterwards
waked
and
was
come
to
no
harm
and
after
i
had
eat
and
drunk
again
i
did
look
outward
over
the
night
land
and
with
particularness
to
that
part
that
i
did
travel
in
as
it
might
be
called
the
yesterday
and
i
did
observe
it
to
be
a
very
bleak
and
desolate
country
and
not
given
over
to
fire
or
other
warmth
nor
to
sulphurvapours
but
to
be
very
quiet
and
with
but
a
little
light
in
all
its
breadth
and
i
could
conceive
that
it
was
no
place
for
anything
of
life
to
desire
but
rather
to
avoid
and
that
country
did
seem
to
be
yet
all
about
me
for
i
was
by
no
means
come
clear
from
it
at
that
time
though
northward
there
was
a
glimmer
as
of
fireholes
and
beyond
those
the
strange
shining
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
after
that
i
had
thought
awhile
i
did
believe
that
i
should
meet
no
monster
of
natural
life
in
all
that
country
of
desolation
until
i
did
draw
nigh
once
more
unto
fire
and
i
conceived
that
this
sound
from
out
of
the
invisible
doorways
might
yet
trouble
me
but
whether
the
quietness
of
that
part
was
because
all
of
natural
life
did
fear
the
sound
or
because
that
there
was
neither
fire
nor
warmth
i
do
not
say
having
no
knowing
in
this
matter
but
may
yet
believe
that
it
was
to
be
laid
to
both
causes
and
this
doth
seem
of
common
reason
as
you
shall
agree
and
when
i
had
looked
a
while
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
which
was
now
truly
a
great
way
off
for
i
had
walked
so
many
weary
hours
i
turned
me
once
more
to
my
journeying
and
here
let
me
observe
that
i
had
gone
very
far
yet
not
so
distant
as
might
be
thought
for
oft
i
did
go
less
than
one
mile
in
an
hour
or
maybe
two
hours
having
to
be
of
great
caution
and
oft
to
hide
and
to
go
upon
my
belly
or
to
crawl
all
as
might
be
and
further
as
you
may
have
perceived
i
made
not
a
straight
forwardness
but
did
strike
this
way
and
that
way
being
very
intent
to
escape
the
monsters
and
evil
forces
that
were
all
about
now
because
that
i
believed
that
i
travelled
in
a
place
where
was
surely
to
be
discovered
those
strange
doorways
within
the
night
i
made
an
especial
care
of
my
going
and
did
stop
oft
that
i
might
listen
and
watch
and
keep
a
very
strict
ward
in
all
the
night
about
me
yet
as
you
shall
see
this
served
not
to
prevent
me
from
going
forward
into
the
fearfulness
of
that
which
did
haunt
all
the
void
for
sudden
as
i
went
carefully
i
heard
a
faint
humming
noise
come
downward
from
the
night
a
little
unto
my
rear
and
the
humming
noise
did
grow
more
plain
as
that
a
door
were
opened
slowly
above
and
did
let
out
that
sound
ever
more
loud
and
surely
after
i
did
hear
that
i
could
not
doubt
that
a
door
were
opened
upward
there
for
the
noise
did
grow
in
such
wise
as
you
shall
hear
a
distant
sound
come
through
when
a
door
truly
is
oped
for
if
the
noise
had
been
made
just
in
that
place
it
had
seemed
to
come
from
there
but
this
sound
though
it
did
come
through
there
was
as
that
it
did
come
outward
from
some
far
lost
and
foreign
eternity
and
this
i
do
struggle
always
to
make
plain
and
you
shall
not
blame
me
that
i
think
overmuch
upon
it
for
in
truth
there
was
an
horror
so
wondrous
and
drear
about
it
that
i
can
forget
not
but
do
strive
always
that
others
should
know
with
me
that
peculiar
woe
and
terror
that
did
haunt
the
night
now
as
you
will
see
i
had
in
truth
gone
past
the
place
where
the
doorway
in
the
night
did
open
yet
had
come
to
no
harm
but
rather
it
did
seem
that
it
opened
by
chance
unwotting
that
i
was
anigh
or
it
may
be
that
my
quiet
passing
did
disturb
an
evil
power
so
that
it
did
even
come
to
listen
or
to
make
search
and
all
this
doth
pass
through
my
brain
as
i
do
write
and
it
doth
seem
to
me
that
my
thoughts
are
but
the
thoughts
of
a
little
child
before
so
great
a
mystery
and
that
i
touch
not
even
the
edge
and
fringe
of
the
truth
with
my
thinkings
and
so
do
cease
upon
them
and
will
but
go
forward
so
plain
as
i
may
with
my
telling
now
as
you
may
truly
believe
when
i
heard
that
sound
and
did
understand
that
i
had
in
verity
come
past
beneath
that
place
i
did
surely
sicken
to
an
utter
weakness
of
body
and
heart
though
it
was
but
for
a
moment
and
then
was
i
swift
hid
within
the
close
shelter
of
the
low
and
thick
mossbushes
and
i
shook
in
all
my
being
and
crept
shaking
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
did
near
totter
to
my
face
thrice
so
weak
gone
was
i
in
that
moment
of
terror
and
i
did
have
a
wickedness
of
forgetting
in
that
time
for
i
bared
not
mine
arm
to
have
the
capsule
to
a
readiness
for
my
death
if
that
did
need
to
be
and
this
was
an
abominable
foolishness
and
i
do
shake
now
when
i
think
upon
it
for
death
is
but
a
little
matter
by
the
side
of
destruction
though
in
truth
dreadful
enough
for
all
yet
as
it
did
chance
no
harm
came
to
me
and
i
gat
away
as
that
some
wondrous
power
did
cast
a
viewless
cloak
about
me
that
i
might
be
utter
hid
and
oft
have
i
wondered
whether
this
was
truly
so
but
have
no
knowing
and
presently
i
ceased
from
fleeing
and
had
some
calmness
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
so
came
to
the
comfort
of
a
firm
spirit
the
which
had
been
sore
troubled
above
all
understanded
causes
by
that
horrid
sounding
upward
in
the
night
and
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
i
did
rest
a
little
but
afterward
went
onward
to
the
northward
going
towards
that
place
where
the
fireholes
did
glimmer
the
same
being
by
this
time
no
great
way
off
then
as
i
did
come
anigh
i
thought
to
hear
once
again
the
sound
in
the
night
and
i
stopt
very
swift
and
hid
into
the
mossbushes
and
did
listen
but
did
hear
naught
and
so
was
hopeful
that
fancy
did
play
upon
me
yet
because
of
this
matter
i
went
upon
my
hands
and
knees
for
a
good
way
and
so
came
at
last
nigh
unto
the
shine
of
one
of
those
fireholes
the
which
i
did
see
for
so
long
now
as
you
shall
suppose
i
went
very
cautious
through
the
bushes
unto
that
redshining
fire
being
careful
both
that
i
did
attract
not
any
evil
force
that
might
listen
in
the
night
and
because
that
there
might
be
some
monster
nigh
to
the
firehole
but
presently
when
i
was
come
so
that
i
could
peer
through
the
bushes
i
did
see
a
little
firehole
set
in
a
small
hollow
and
there
did
no
thing
seem
to
lurk
anigh
and
the
sight
of
that
warmth
did
cheer
me
for
it
was
long
since
i
did
have
the
comfort
of
such
a
matter
and
when
i
had
lain
hid
awhile
that
i
might
watch
all
about
i
saw
the
place
to
be
safe
and
quiet
and
i
went
out
from
the
mossbushes
and
sat
down
a
space
from
the
fire
which
did
fill
the
pit
in
which
it
did
lift
and
bubble
and
the
noise
that
it
sent
out
was
strange
and
slow
and
it
did
seem
to
gruntle
gently
unto
itself
in
that
lonesome
hollow
as
that
it
had
made
a
long
and
quiet
grumbling
there
through
eternity
and
oft
was
it
still
and
made
no
sound
and
again
would
give
an
odd
bubbling
in
the
quietness
and
send
off
as
it
did
seem
a
little
smoke
of
sulphur
and
afterward
fall
once
more
upon
a
quiet
and
so
i
did
sit
there
very
hushed
and
restful
and
the
loneliness
did
lie
all
about
me
and
the
red
shine
of
the
firehole
did
glow
soft
in
the
hollow
and
i
was
glad
to
be
quiet
for
my
heart
was
weary
and
there
was
to
my
back
a
little
rock
that
did
jut
upward
so
high
as
a
man
and
the
rock
was
warm
and
pleasant
to
lean
upon
and
moreover
did
seem
to
guard
me
from
behind
and
there
i
ate
and
drunk
and
kept
very
still
and
so
was
presently
rested
and
this
i
did
need
as
you
have
perceived
for
i
was
gone
sudden
weary
of
the
heart
as
i
did
say
and
this
might
be
because
that
i
did
never
cease
to
have
destruction
over
me
to
companion
my
way
though
as
you
will
mind
i
had
been
no
more
than
twelve
hours
afoot
since
my
last
sleeping
yet
i
doubt
not
you
do
understand
and
presently
my
heart
grew
strong
again
within
me
and
i
had
a
warmth
in
my
spirit
and
i
got
up
from
the
earth
and
stretched
out
mine
arms
and
i
saw
that
my
gear
was
safe
upon
me
and
afterward
did
grip
the
diskos
as
it
were
newly
then
i
went
away
from
the
firehole
and
climbed
the
far
slope
of
the
hollow
and
went
northward
and
there
were
before
me
many
of
the
fireholes
for
i
did
perceive
them
to
shine
in
the
night
for
a
great
way
as
it
did
seem
that
they
were
a
path
of
red
shinings
that
led
me
onward
to
the
northwest
of
the
light
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
now
i
had
a
believing
that
i
had
come
out
of
the
country
where
did
lurk
those
horrid
doorways
in
the
night
and
i
went
not
with
so
utter
a
weight
upon
my
heart
and
did
feel
that
naught
should
come
now
upon
the
back
of
my
neck
which
had
been
an
odd
and
troublesome
fancy
whilst
that
i
did
creep
through
that
country
of
gloom
yet
as
you
shall
know
i
went
with
no
foolish
confidence
but
with
a
great
caution
and
mine
hearing
keen
to
hark
and
a
care
to
my
steps
and
did
ever
watch
around
me
as
i
journeyed
and
because
that
i
went
forward
in
this
proper
and
sedate
manner
i
had
great
cause
for
a
thankful
heart
as
you
may
perceive
for
i
had
come
after
a
long
way
to
another
of
those
hollows
where
did
burn
one
of
the
fireholes
and
i
made
a
pause
upon
the
edge
of
the
hollow
in
which
it
did
lie
and
looked
downward
keeping
guarded
within
the
mossbushes
where
they
grew
anigh
to
the
top
thereof
but
there
was
no
living
thing
there
to
be
seen
and
i
went
downward
so
that
i
should
warm
my
body
at
the
fire
and
lo
as
i
stood
upon
this
side
of
the
firehole
and
turned
myself
about
i
looked
presently
more
keenly
to
the
other
side
for
the
yellowness
of
the
earth
did
seem
a
little
strange
in
one
place
but
i
could
see
with
no
plainness
because
that
there
arose
a
glare
from
the
fire
against
mine
eyes
and
i
went
round
that
i
should
look
the
better
yet
with
no
fear
or
thought
of
evil
in
my
heart
and
truly
when
i
was
come
upon
that
far
side
of
the
firehole
lo
there
was
spread
out
in
the
yellow
sand
of
that
place
a
curious
thing
and
i
went
more
nigh
and
stooped
to
look
upon
it
and
behold
it
moved
and
the
sand
all
about
did
move
for
a
great
space
so
that
i
gave
back
very
swift
and
swung
upward
with
the
diskos
and
strangely
i
heard
the
sand
to
stir
at
my
back
and
i
looked
round
very
quick
and
the
sand
rose
upward
in
parts
and
sifted
back
and
there
came
to
my
sight
odd
things
that
did
move
and
curl
about
and
immediately
before
i
knew
which
way
to
go
i
knew
that
the
sand
did
shift
under
my
feet
and
did
work
and
heave
so
that
i
was
tottered
and
was
shaken
also
in
the
heart
for
i
knew
not
what
to
think
in
that
instant
then
did
i
perceive
that
i
was
all
surrounded
and
i
ran
swift
upon
the
heaving
sand
unto
the
edge
of
the
firehole
and
i
turned
there
and
looked
quickly
for
i
did
not
know
what
this
new
terror
should
be
and
i
saw
that
a
yellow
thing
did
hump
upward
from
out
of
the
sand
as
it
had
been
a
low
hillock
that
did
live
and
the
sand
shed
downward
from
it
and
it
did
gather
to
itself
strange
and
horrid
arms
from
the
sand
all
about
it
and
it
stretched
two
of
the
arms
unto
me
but
i
smote
with
the
diskos
and
i
smote
thrice
and
afterward
they
did
wriggle
upon
the
sand
but
this
was
not
the
end
as
i
did
hope
for
the
yellow
thing
arose
and
ran
at
me
as
it
might
be
that
you
should
see
a
spider
run
and
i
did
leap
backward
this
way
and
that
but
the
monster
had
a
great
swiftness
so
that
i
did
seem
surely
lost
then
made
i
a
strong
and
instant
resolve
for
i
perceived
that
i
had
no
hope
to
slay
this
thing
save
that
i
should
come
at
it
in
the
body
and
i
put
everything
to
the
chance
and
made
not
to
escape
any
more
but
ran
straight
in
among
the
legs
and
there
were
great
hairs
like
to
spines
upon
the
legs
and
these
had
pricked
me
to
the
death
but
that
the
armour
saved
me
now
i
had
done
this
thing
with
a
wondrous
quickness
so
that
i
was
under
the
mighty
arching
of
the
legs
before
the
yellow
thing
did
wot
of
my
intent
and
the
body
was
bristled
with
the
great
hairs
and
poison
did
seem
to
come
from
them
and
to
ooze
from
them
strangely
in
great
and
shining
drops
and
the
monster
heaved
itself
up
to
one
side
that
it
might
bring
certain
of
the
legs
inward
to
grasp
me
yet
in
that
moment
did
i
smite
utter
fierce
with
the
diskosthrusting
and
the
diskos
did
spin
and
hum
and
roar
and
sent
out
a
wondrous
blaze
of
flame
as
that
it
had
been
a
devouring
death
and
it
sundered
the
body
of
the
yellow
thing
and
did
seem
as
that
it
screamed
to
rage
amid
the
entrails
thereof
so
wondrous
was
the
fury
and
energy
of
that
trusted
weapon
and
i
was
covered
with
the
muck
of
the
thing
and
the
claws
upon
the
legs
seized
me
so
that
the
grey
armour
did
bend
and
crack
to
the
might
thereof
and
i
grew
sick
unto
death
with
the
pain
within
but
smote
with
the
shining
diskos
using
my
left
hand
weakly
for
my
right
was
gript
dreadful
fast
to
my
body
and
lo
i
was
sudden
free
and
a
great
blow
did
knock
me
far
across
the
hollow
so
that
i
was
like
to
have
fallen
into
the
firehole
but
fell
instead
upon
the
edge
and
came
backward
unto
safety
and
i
turned
me
about
and
the
yellow
thing
did
throw
the
sand
all
ways
as
it
did
die
but
had
lost
power
to
come
upon
me
and
for
my
part
i
lay
weak
upon
the
earth
and
was
no
more
able
to
fight
nor
could
i
do
more
than
breathe
for
a
great
while
but
yet
came
presently
to
health
and
made
to
examine
my
hurts
then
i
saw
there
was
no
great
wound
anywhere
upon
me
but
only
an
utter
bruising
and
i
found
upon
my
right
leg
that
there
was
a
sharp
and
hairy
claw
clipt
about
it
but
the
armour
had
saved
me
from
harm
of
the
horrid
thing
so
that
i
did
but
kick
it
free
with
my
left
foot
and
thence
into
the
firehole
now
by
this
time
that
monstrous
creature
was
dead
but
i
held
off
from
it
and
went
upon
the
other
side
of
the
fire
for
i
was
yet
surely
in
horror
of
it
and
i
sat
for
a
time
and
did
think
upon
all
matters
that
did
concern
me
and
i
saw
that
i
should
have
not
comfort
of
heart
until
i
was
washed
clean
from
the
taint
of
the
monster
and
i
gat
me
up
wearily
to
go
forth
into
the
night
again
that
i
should
make
a
search
for
a
hot
spring
of
which
i
had
come
past
many
and
i
had
oft
found
them
to
be
nigh
unto
the
fireholes
so
that
i
was
trustful
that
i
should
see
one
ere
long
and
lo
there
was
a
little
hollow
just
beyond
and
scarce
a
hundred
paces
off
and
in
the
hollow
there
did
shine
three
small
fireholes
and
there
was
a
steaming
puddle
as
did
seem
beyond
the
third
of
the
holes
now
before
i
adventured
downward
into
this
place
i
went
all
about
the
topmost
edge
and
made
a
search
of
the
mossbushes
about
but
found
naught
that
should
scare
me
and
afterward
i
went
all
across
the
hollow
but
did
find
no
monstrous
thing
hid
anywheres
yet
there
was
that
in
the
place
that
discouraged
me
and
did
keep
me
from
stripping
mine
armour
so
that
i
should
bathe
in
the
hot
puddle
for
i
stept
upon
a
small
serpent
and
the
same
did
lap
about
my
leg
but
could
do
me
no
hurt
for
the
armour
which
was
a
very
blessed
protection
and
i
freed
myself
from
it
with
the
handle
of
the
diskos
and
because
that
i
could
not
go
naked
to
my
cleansing
i
tried
first
the
hotness
of
the
water
which
was
not
over
great
and
afterward
did
take
off
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
the
cloak
and
laid
them
with
the
diskos
upon
the
edge
of
the
warm
puddle
then
i
stept
into
the
water
and
was
immediately
gone
downward
a
great
way
for
truly
it
was
no
puddle
as
i
had
supposed
but
a
deep
well
as
you
might
call
it
of
hot
and
sulphury
water
and
this
doth
show
how
a
man
may
act
foolishly
even
when
he
doth
believe
that
he
hath
a
great
caution
and
surely
it
is
borne
in
upon
me
afresh
that
none
should
trust
over
freely
unto
unproven
matters
the
which
shall
you
heartily
agree
with
but
yet
do
as
foolishly
according
to
your
lights
and
characters
and
so
shall
you
laugh
not
over
hardly
upon
me
now
i
had
gone
over
the
head
and
surely
i
do
not
know
what
deepness
was
there
yet
as
you
shall
think
i
stayed
not
to
consider
upon
this
matter
but
made
to
climb
out
and
much
shaken
with
my
splutterings
and
the
smartings
of
mine
eyes
for
truly
the
water
was
strong
with
sulphur
matters
yet
very
cleansing
was
it
as
i
did
presently
see
for
there
was
no
more
any
taint
or
horridness
upon
mine
armour
or
the
flesh
of
my
face
or
hands
and
i
took
the
diskos
and
washed
it
clean
also
and
then
the
cloak
and
afterward
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
the
bands
of
the
same
and
after
i
had
done
this
i
was
minded
to
dry
myself
by
the
little
fireholes
but
when
i
was
come
there
lo
maybe
a
score
small
serpents
were
about
those
places
and
i
was
strongly
pleased
that
i
should
keep
away
yet
that
i
must
warm
and
dry
me
in
that
desolate
and
bitter
night
land
you
shall
agree
and
to
this
end
i
put
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
upon
me
and
afterwards
took
the
diskos
readily
into
my
hand
and
ran
quietly
unto
the
hollow
where
i
did
fight
with
the
yellow
thing
and
the
cloak
i
bore
in
my
left
hand
now
when
i
was
gat
there
i
was
truly
glad
to
think
that
there
were
no
serpents
in
that
place
and
because
that
i
had
slain
the
monster
of
the
place
how
should
it
be
that
any
harm
might
come
unto
me
for
truly
was
it
not
like
that
a
creature
of
such
might
should
keep
all
that
hollow
unto
itself
and
slay
any
that
did
come
therein
and
thereby
preserve
that
place
from
all
other
horror
though
surely
until
it
did
die
and
cease
to
be
there
had
been
no
call
for
any
greater
abomination
now
all
this
did
go
through
my
brain
as
i
did
sit
to
dry
mine
armour
and
my
body
and
my
gear
upon
that
side
of
the
firehole
which
was
away
from
the
slain
monster
and
i
made
presently
to
think
that
this
would
be
a
sure
and
proper
refuge
wherein
to
sleep
for
truly
it
must
have
gotten
a
place
where
none
other
creature
should
be
like
to
come
to
work
me
harm
and
it
must
be
that
you
do
all
see
with
me
in
this
matter
and
commend
me
that
i
thought
with
properness
and
so
did
i
resolve
that
i
put
my
disgust
within
my
pocket
as
we
do
say
and
stay
safe
and
quiet
within
that
hollow
and
this
thing
i
did
surely
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
presently
i
went
over
to
the
dead
monster
and
made
very
sure
that
it
was
truly
slain
which
indeed
it
was
and
after
that
i
had
seen
to
this
matter
i
returned
unto
the
firehole
and
made
a
comfortable
place
in
the
sand
for
my
rest
for
i
was
well
dry
by
this
and
i
wrapped
the
cloak
about
me
and
took
the
diskos
to
my
breast
for
a
sure
companion
as
it
had
truly
proved
in
my
need
and
i
could
think
almost
that
it
did
nestle
unto
me
as
that
it
knew
and
loved
me
but
this
thing
can
be
no
more
than
a
fancy
and
i
do
but
set
it
down
as
such
and
that
it
doth
show
my
feeling
and
mind
at
that
time
then
ere
i
did
compose
myself
to
slumber
i
looked
about
me
upward
to
the
edges
of
the
hollow
and
i
perceived
that
i
was
lost
to
the
sight
of
the
mighty
pyramid
for
i
was
come
so
far
off
that
it
looked
not
down
from
so
wondrous
a
height
as
you
shall
perceive
and
moreover
the
hollow
was
something
deep
and
afterward
as
i
lay
my
head
back
upon
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
which
were
to
me
my
pillow
i
went
to
think
a
little
upon
naani
as
alway
i
did
in
my
constant
journeying
yet
presently
i
strove
sometimes
that
i
put
her
from
my
mind
that
i
should
sleep
for
a
bitter
sorrow
and
anxiousness
was
oft
upon
me
when
that
i
did
think
upon
her
and
this
you
may
know
for
truly
i
knew
not
what
terror
was
come
to
her
afar
in
the
silence
of
the
night
and
did
i
think
overmuch
i
should
feel
that
i
could
have
no
calmness
needful
to
sleep
but
to
need
to
walk
for
ever
until
i
died
which
could
not
be
long
and
so
should
i
make
a
foolishness
of
mine
anxious
journeying
to
do
her
true
service
and
to
save
her
from
destruction
if
such
did
truly
threaten
and
i
was
soon
gone
over
to
sleep
and
waked
not
for
seven
hours
being
much
wearied
by
the
fight
and
the
soreness
of
my
body
the
which
did
put
me
into
a
great
pain
as
i
did
rise
upward
from
my
slumber
but
this
was
presently
something
less
and
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
afterward
did
put
my
gear
upon
me
and
went
forward
into
the
night
having
the
diskos
in
my
hand
and
my
heart
was
glad
that
i
had
come
safe
through
the
time
of
my
sleep
now
i
walked
six
hours
and
did
stop
a
little
to
eat
and
drink
and
went
on
again
and
it
was
in
this
second
third
of
the
day
that
i
saw
afar
to
my
right
two
strange
and
wondrous
men
and
they
did
shine
as
they
had
been
made
of
a
pale
mist
and
they
came
anigh
going
very
swift
and
did
seem
as
that
they
were
maybe
forty
feet
high
yet
having
no
thickness
and
i
hid
downward
into
the
mossbushes
and
they
past
me
so
quiet
as
a
cloud
of
this
day
might
go
and
did
appear
to
be
if
i
did
guess
but
an
hundred
fathoms
off
yet
was
this
no
sure
thing
for
their
position
had
no
more
surety
than
shall
a
rainbow
have
in
this
age
and
so
they
were
gone
onward
into
the
night
and
did
seem
to
come
out
of
the
north
and
they
did
appear
not
to
wot
of
me
and
whether
they
were
harmful
i
know
not
for
they
harmed
not
me
and
i
lay
there
in
the
mossbushes
until
they
were
well
gone
away
and
i
had
belief
that
they
must
be
those
same
mistmen
that
were
told
of
in
certain
of
the
olden
records
but
were
never
seen
anigh
to
the
pyramid
though
i
had
thought
odd
times
to
see
men
as
of
mist
through
the
great
spyglass
when
i
was
within
the
tower
of
observation
but
they
were
always
a
mighty
way
off
and
some
would
say
it
was
but
a
bright
vapour
that
did
move
yet
would
others
be
in
doubt
and
so
is
it
ever
in
such
matters
and
here
let
me
take
chance
to
say
how
that
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
speak
of
such
happenings
to
men
of
this
age
and
to
make
the
truth
proper
unto
them
and
because
of
this
oft
am
i
tempted
to
say
no
word
upon
many
things
that
i
did
see
yet
must
i
tell
my
tale
or
suffer
from
the
weight
of
it
within
me
and
so
shall
you
hark
to
me
and
give
me
your
sympathy
and
human
understanding
and
concerning
these
mistmen
i
have
wondered
oft
whether
they
were
the
visible
shape
of
some
of
those
many
forces
that
were
abroad
in
the
night
land
for
they
did
truly
seem
to
me
as
that
a
thing
of
strange
life
were
half
shown
to
my
human
eyes
yet
i
do
not
know
and
am
but
telling
of
my
natural
thoughts
and
ponderings
now
as
i
did
say
those
mistmen
were
never
seen
nigh
unto
the
pyramid
and
were
as
i
did
hint
always
so
far
off
that
they
were
half
given
over
to
the
fables
of
the
olden
days
in
the
beliefs
of
the
peoples
of
the
mighty
redoubt
and
set
about
with
an
halo
of
unrealness
for
none
within
the
great
pyramid
had
ever
beheld
them
with
surety
and
because
that
now
i
saw
them
anigh
to
me
it
was
borne
in
afresh
upon
my
spirit
how
greatly
i
had
wandered
away
and
how
that
i
stood
afar
in
the
lonesomeness
of
that
land
of
night
as
it
had
been
that
a
man
of
this
age
did
wander
amid
the
stars
and
perceive
a
great
comet
to
go
by
him
very
close
for
then
he
should
know
in
his
heart
how
that
he
was
far
off
in
the
void
and
this
i
do
say
to
you
that
you
may
know
somewhat
of
the
emotions
of
my
heart
in
that
moment
yet
presently
i
shook
free
of
my
melancholy
and
lonesomeness
and
rose
up
out
of
the
mossbushes
and
went
onward
and
as
ever
i
thought
much
upon
the
maid
that
i
did
search
for
yet
strove
to
think
quietly
concerning
her
state
else
should
i
have
turned
to
running
and
wrecked
my
body
before
that
i
had
gone
any
great
way
and
that
day
i
passed
seven
large
fireholes
and
two
that
were
small
and
always
i
came
softly
unto
them
for
there
were
oft
living
things
about
the
warmth
and
at
the
sixth
firehole
i
did
see
that
which
i
did
think
to
be
a
great
man
that
did
sit
to
the
fire
with
monstrous
knees
drawn
upward
unto
his
chin
and
the
nose
was
great
and
bent
downward
and
the
eyes
very
large
and
did
shine
with
the
light
from
the
firehole
and
moved
watching
always
this
way
and
that
so
that
the
white
parts
did
show
now
this
side
and
now
that
but
it
was
not
properly
a
man
and
i
went
away
very
quiet
from
that
place
and
looked
oft
backward
until
that
i
was
sure
of
safety
for
it
was
a
very
horrid
monster
and
had
that
place
to
be
for
a
lair
as
i
did
judge
from
the
smell
thereof
and
when
the
eighteenth
hour
was
come
i
looked
about
for
a
safe
place
to
my
sleep
and
i
kept
away
now
from
the
fireholes
for
i
did
always
find
the
more
life
there
yet
when
i
came
to
my
rest
i
was
lacking
of
warmth
by
reason
of
this
care
and
could
scarce
sleep
at
all
because
that
i
was
so
cold
yet
managed
something
of
slumber
after
a
while
but
woke
very
stiff
and
was
glad
to
beat
my
hands
and
bestir
myself
that
i
should
come
to
some
warmth
of
life
and
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
i
put
my
gear
upon
me
and
took
the
diskos
in
my
hand
and
went
forward
again
upon
my
journey
and
here
i
should
tell
that
i
was
come
soon
unto
the
northwest
border
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
presently
i
was
but
a
little
way
off
from
it
and
did
go
direct
to
the
north
so
that
the
plain
was
always
upon
my
right
now
this
plain
was
a
strange
and
fearsome
place
as
you
shall
see
for
it
was
as
that
a
blue
void
did
rise
upward
from
the
earth
in
all
the
country
of
that
plain
for
surely
the
plain
did
not
lumber
with
flame
but
was
hid
with
a
strange
and
inburning
light
as
of
a
shining
atmosphere
of
a
cold
blue
colour
and
it
did
throw
no
sure
light
upon
the
night
land
as
had
seemed
proper
but
was
a
very
dreadful
cold
shining
as
of
a
luminous
and
blue
void
and
the
mossbushes
grew
nigh
to
the
edge
of
the
plain
and
did
show
to
me
black
and
strange
against
that
horrid
gloom
of
light
and
you
shall
know
that
i
could
not
see
into
the
plain
for
it
was
as
that
the
cold
blue
light
was
a
void
that
swallowed
all
within
it
and
gave
no
power
to
the
eye
that
aught
should
be
perceived
and
it
stood
between
me
and
the
mighty
pyramid
and
i
could
nowise
see
across
and
i
know
not
whether
i
do
make
all
this
matter
clear
unto
you
for
surely
it
is
no
easy
task
and
presently
i
had
gone
very
quiet
upon
my
hands
and
knees
through
the
mossbushes
and
i
came
near
upon
the
edge
of
the
plain
and
hid
there
in
a
clump
of
the
mossbush
and
peered
forth
and
harked
and
i
heard
constant
voices
that
did
call
to
one
another
across
the
plain
as
it
were
that
strange
peoples
of
spirits
did
wander
within
that
blue
shining
and
did
make
a
calling
one
to
the
other
and
were
all
hid
and
held
apart
and
surely
i
could
see
naught
and
did
judge
as
i
have
writ
that
they
likewise
went
blindly
and
truly
is
this
a
strange
matter
to
set
out
and
easy
to
think
on
with
doubt
yet
as
i
did
see
so
have
i
told
for
in
verity
there
were
surely
hidden
peoples
of
spirits
scattered
and
lost
afar
upon
that
improper
plain
and
you
shall
judge
that
i
kept
safe
hid
for
whether
this
might
have
any
natural
explaining
or
whether
it
was
a
matter
that
did
go
utter
beyond
knowledge
of
man
i
did
not
know
for
surely
in
that
strange
land
it
did
like
to
be
an
horrid
danger
in
any
case
and
whether
of
some
monstrous
creatures
or
of
the
evil
forces
of
the
land
i
did
wisely
to
be
away
and
for
two
days
i
did
make
a
safe
coasting
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
did
keep
well
off
maybe
two
great
miles
among
the
mossbushes
and
i
made
a
very
good
speed
through
the
darkness
and
at
the
eighteenth
hour
of
each
journey
i
made
a
place
for
my
slumber
and
the
first
i
did
manage
under
a
thick
bush
but
the
second
was
high
upon
the
ledge
of
a
rock
that
grew
upward
in
the
night
amid
the
bushes
and
save
that
i
was
bitter
cold
there
did
no
harm
come
to
me
and
in
all
that
time
of
journeying
i
had
no
sight
of
the
mighty
pyramid
for
the
blind
shining
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
was
ever
between
now
there
had
been
certain
little
matters
in
my
journey
beside
the
plain
of
blue
fire
which
i
have
not
set
down
for
they
were
of
no
account
and
do
but
repeat
much
that
i
have
told
before
and
indeed
there
was
naught
in
that
part
of
my
journey
save
that
i
did
pass
nineteen
great
fireholes
and
four
small
and
did
observe
no
life
beside
any
save
about
one
of
the
great
holes
that
there
was
no
hollow
around
and
here
i
did
happen
to
see
some
strange
and
ugly
creatures
so
big
as
my
head
that
did
have
a
look
of
the
scorpion
of
this
age
but
proportioned
more
squat
and
thick
yet
though
they
were
naught
to
remark
upon
in
that
land
they
had
been
but
woeful
bedmates
to
any
man
as
you
may
think
and
you
shall
know
how
it
gave
a
rest
to
my
spirit
that
i
did
go
so
long
with
no
trouble
of
the
monsters
of
the
night
or
the
evil
forces
thereof
and
i
grew
bolder
to
my
journeying
and
made
ever
a
greater
speed
of
going
and
it
was
like
that
i
took
presently
a
less
heed
for
my
safety
which
was
a
wrong
and
foolish
state
yet
there
came
no
harm
unto
me
in
all
that
part
of
my
travel
then
it
was
in
the
sixteenth
hour
of
the
third
day
of
my
journey
beside
the
plain
that
i
did
come
out
beyond
the
end
of
it
and
had
fresh
sight
of
the
mighty
pyramid
afar
in
the
night
upon
my
right
and
i
stopt
there
in
a
bare
place
among
the
mossbushes
and
did
in
a
weak
moment
hold
up
the
diskos
so
that
i
make
a
salute
unto
the
pyramid
mine
home
for
truly
was
i
so
utter
glad
to
behold
it
once
more
and
in
a
little
while
was
i
aware
that
there
was
a
disturbance
of
the
aether
of
the
world
all
about
me
so
that
it
did
seem
that
there
had
been
one
at
the
great
spyglass
to
watch
for
my
coming
into
their
sight
from
behind
the
shining
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
it
was
like
that
news
had
gone
downward
through
the
cities
of
the
great
redoubt
so
that
they
did
print
the
word
of
it
in
the
hourslips
and
by
this
there
would
be
many
great
millions
thinking
upon
me
and
a
rushing
unto
the
embrasures
that
they
might
spy
out
at
me
yet
i
doubt
that
any
glass
might
perceive
me
surely
at
so
great
a
space
save
the
power
of
the
great
spyglass
in
the
tower
of
observation
but
the
emotion
of
the
millions
to
reach
to
me
and
you
shall
know
that
it
did
seem
homely
and
sweet
unto
me
to
hear
all
about
me
the
shaking
of
the
aether
of
the
world
and
to
be
ware
that
so
many
did
think
humanly
upon
me
and
had
prayers
unto
my
safety
and
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
stand
so
utter
far
off
in
the
night
and
to
look
back
to
that
everlasting
hill
of
light
that
was
grown
something
small
by
the
distance
and
to
have
surety
that
i
was
lookt
upon
through
the
great
spyglass
maybe
by
the
kindly
eye
of
my
dear
friend
the
master
monstruwacan
and
so
keenly
that
he
could
it
might
be
make
almost
to
guess
the
look
within
mine
eyes
as
i
did
gaze
backward
unto
that
mine
home
yet
though
this
dear
and
homely
sympathy
was
a
sweet
and
companionable
thing
to
my
heart
it
came
swift
to
my
thought
that
i
was
in
a
sore
danger
if
that
they
ceased
not
quickly
to
think
so
onely
upon
me
for
surely
was
i
not
come
overnear
unto
that
dreadful
house
of
silence
and
well
might
so
much
emotion
of
the
millions
tell
unto
the
horrid
power
that
dwelt
within
how
that
i
was
even
anigh
and
so
shall
you
see
the
mixt
feelings
that
came
upon
me
everyway
yet
as
it
did
chance
the
aether
was
quieted
in
a
little
for
it
did
need
unity
of
the
millions
being
that
they
were
untrained
to
their
spiritual
powers
to
stir
the
aether
and
so
was
i
more
easy
of
mind
and
went
forward
again
upon
my
way
now
as
it
did
chance
at
the
eighteenth
hour
i
was
come
to
a
place
where
i
heard
a
noise
of
water
and
i
went
to
my
left
that
i
might
come
upon
it
and
there
boiled
a
hot
fountain
that
went
up
out
of
the
rock
of
that
place
and
the
water
rose
upward
in
a
column
and
was
maybe
so
thick
as
my
body
and
it
fell
unto
the
north
for
the
water
came
not
up
straightly
but
did
shoot
out
from
the
earth
unto
that
way
and
i
saw
the
thing
plain
for
there
were
many
fireholes
all
about
as
you
shall
have
wotted
from
my
telling
and
so
was
there
a
certain
and
constant
light
in
that
part
of
the
land
and
i
followed
the
water
that
ran
from
the
fountain
and
tried
it
with
mine
hand
but
found
it
to
burn
and
so
did
go
further
beside
it
for
presently
it
should
be
no
hotter
than
i
did
need
and
it
went
onward
winding
among
the
mossbushes
and
sent
up
a
constant
steam
that
hung
about
it
and
the
steam
made
a
red
cloud
about
the
way
that
it
did
go
for
the
lights
from
the
fireholes
made
a
shining
upon
it
and
so
was
it
a
wondrous
pretty
sight
now
presently
i
tried
the
stream
again
and
found
it
to
be
nicely
warm
and
i
sat
upon
a
little
rock
and
took
off
my
footgear
that
i
might
bathe
my
feet
which
were
gone
something
tender
moreover
i
did
ache
to
have
the
sweetness
of
water
about
me
and
i
made
that
i
should
bathe
my
feet
and
afterwards
find
a
place
among
the
mossbushes
and
so
eat
and
drink
and
have
my
slumber
then
as
i
did
sit
there
beside
that
warm
stream
with
my
feet
dabbled
therein
i
heard
sudden
afar
off
the
voice
of
a
mighty
nighthound
baying
in
the
night
and
the
sound
came
from
the
northwest
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
there
was
afterward
a
quiet
and
you
shall
see
me
sitting
there
upon
the
rock
by
the
side
of
that
smoking
river
and
the
steam
all
about
me
and
my
feet
within
the
lovely
warmth
of
the
water
and
i
very
still
and
frozen
with
a
sudden
fear
for
it
did
seem
to
me
in
an
instant
that
the
nighthound
might
surely
be
upon
the
track
of
my
goings
and
after
that
there
had
passed
a
little
time
the
while
that
i
did
listen
very
keen
lo
there
burst
out
in
the
night
as
it
did
seem
scarce
a
mile
off
the
monstrous
deep
baying
of
the
giant
hound
and
i
knew
surely
that
the
brute
did
track
me
and
a
sick
and
utter
horror
did
fall
upon
me
so
that
i
could
scarce
get
my
footgear
upon
me
once
more
yet
in
truth
i
was
not
long
to
the
matter
and
was
to
my
feet
and
did
hold
the
diskos
ready
and
very
desperate
i
was
to
the
heart
for
it
is
ever
a
fearsome
thing
to
be
put
in
chase
and
the
worse
an
hundred
times
when
there
is
a
sure
knowledge
that
a
deathly
monster
doth
be
the
pursuer
now
i
did
stand
there
but
a
moment
it
did
seem
to
make
an
anxious
considering
how
that
i
might
best
assure
me
some
chance
to
live
through
this
swift
coming
danger
and
then
did
i
think
upon
the
stream
to
use
it
and
i
leapt
quick
therein
and
did
run
very
strong
down
the
middle
part
which
was
nowheres
so
much
as
thighdeep
and
oft
not
above
mine
ankles
and
as
i
did
run
there
came
again
the
bellow
of
that
dire
brute
following
and
was
now
as
mine
ears
did
say
scarce
the
half
of
a
mile
to
my
rear
and
i
did
run
but
the
stronger
for
the
dread
of
the
sound
and
so
maybe
for
a
little
minute
and
after
that
time
i
stopt
from
mine
heavy
running
and
went
very
wary
that
i
made
no
loud
splashing
for
by
now
the
monsterbrute
should
be
something
anigh
to
that
place
where
i
did
enter
the
stream
and
i
looked
round
with
a
constant
looking
but
did
see
no
surely
visible
thing
though
my
fear
did
shape
me
an
hound
from
every
shadow
of
the
mossbushes
about
me
then
in
a
moment
i
did
hear
the
great
beast
for
it
bayed
but
a
little
way
up
the
stream
as
that
it
had
overshot
the
place
where
the
scent
did
end
and
immediately
i
sank
swiftly
into
the
water
which
was
there
so
deep
as
my
knee
and
turned
upon
my
belly
and
the
water
surged
over
my
shoulders
for
i
kept
my
head
above
and
so
i
did
look
eager
and
fearful
through
the
steam
into
the
shadows
and
the
halfdarkness
towards
where
i
did
think
to
see
the
nighthound
and
in
a
moment
i
saw
it
coming
and
it
was
a
little
vague
by
reason
of
the
smoke
of
the
river
yet
did
seem
black
and
monstrous
in
the
gloom
and
great
as
a
mighty
horse
and
it
went
past
me
at
a
vast
and
lumbersome
gallop
but
i
did
not
see
it
in
that
moment
for
i
dived
my
head
down
unto
the
rock
of
the
river
bottom
and
held
downward
until
that
i
was
like
to
burst
for
sore
longing
of
breath
then
i
put
upward
my
head
and
took
swift
and
deep
breathings
and
lookt
about
me
very
cautious
and
fearful
as
you
can
know
and
i
heard
the
nighthound
casting
round
among
the
mossbushes
and
it
did
send
up
a
wild
and
awesome
baying
and
i
heard
the
bushes
brake
and
smash
beneath
it
as
it
did
run
to
and
hither
and
afterward
there
was
a
quiet
yet
i
moved
not
but
stayed
there
very
low
in
the
water
and
did
have
a
thankful
heart
that
it
was
warm
and
easy
to
persist
in
for
i
had
surely
died
of
a
frozen
heart
if
that
it
had
been
cold
for
by
this
time
you
do
know
even
with
me
how
bitter
was
the
chill
of
the
land
now
i
had
been
awhile
lain
thus
upon
my
belly
and
heard
no
sound
from
the
monstrous
hound
yet
i
ceased
not
to
be
full
of
an
horrid
unease
concerning
the
great
beast
for
i
did
better
to
know
what
it
did
than
to
have
no
knowing
and
sudden
i
heard
the
sound
of
it
running
very
swiftly
and
coming
nigh
and
it
passed
me
and
did
go
up
the
stream
and
there
was
surely
a
quick
stupor
upon
me
for
i
ducked
not
my
head
under
the
water
but
stayed
very
still
which
as
it
did
chance
was
maybe
not
such
an
utter
foolishness
for
my
head
did
seem
in
that
halfgloom
to
be
mayhap
no
more
than
a
little
rock
in
the
water
and
i
made
no
move
to
tell
of
life
yet
should
the
hound
have
smelled
me
and
that
it
failed
in
this
matter
doth
be
a
puzzle
to
me
and
as
the
great
nighthound
past
me
it
tore
the
earth
and
the
bushes
with
the
exceeding
strength
that
it
put
forth
to
run
and
clods
of
the
earth
and
stones
of
bigness
were
cast
this
way
and
that
by
the
feet
of
the
hound
running
and
so
shall
you
have
a
little
knowledge
of
the
strength
of
that
beast
and
the
hound
ran
on
into
the
distance
and
presently
i
heard
it
baying
in
the
night
then
i
rose
and
went
onward
down
the
warm
stream
and
made
a
strong
walking
yet
keeping
alway
to
the
water
and
oft
did
stop
a
little
that
i
should
listen
and
always
i
heard
the
nighthound
a
great
way
off
in
the
night
baying
and
seeming
that
it
did
surely
run
to
and
fro
searching
now
i
journeyed
thus
for
twelve
hours
and
the
baying
of
the
hound
making
search
did
never
cease
and
i
kept
always
to
the
water
as
i
did
say
that
i
should
leave
no
scent
unto
the
hound
and
by
that
twelve
weary
hours
had
gone
i
found
that
i
was
come
anigh
unto
the
house
of
silence
and
this
put
me
in
great
trouble
as
you
may
perceive
for
surely
had
mine
whole
effort
been
to
the
end
that
i
should
avoid
that
house
by
a
great
way
yet
had
the
hound
driven
me
thus
anear
now
i
saw
that
the
small
river
did
go
onward
and
did
make
a
breach
across
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
and
i
determined
in
my
heart
that
i
should
leave
the
water
which
was
now
grown
nigh
to
a
bitter
cold
in
that
it
was
so
long
upon
the
face
of
the
land
yet
chiefly
did
i
mind
to
leave
the
water
that
i
should
come
no
more
anigh
unto
that
house
of
silence
for
the
water
did
go
that
way
and
i
stood
awhile
and
did
listen
for
the
baying
of
the
hound
but
could
hear
it
no
more
and
did
have
a
surety
within
me
that
it
was
indeed
gone
from
searching
for
me
then
i
came
out
of
the
water
and
went
forward
stooping
and
creeping
among
the
mossbushes
going
outward
to
the
westward
of
north
so
that
i
should
go
away
so
quickly
as
i
might
from
the
nearness
of
the
house
yet
lo
i
was
gone
upon
my
hands
and
knees
no
more
than
an
hundred
fathoms
when
i
did
find
the
mossbushes
to
cease
to
the
westward
for
a
great
way
and
there
to
be
a
great
bareness
of
rock
which
in
truth
was
much
shown
thereabout
and
i
dared
not
to
go
outward
upon
that
naked
land
for
then
i
had
not
been
hid
by
the
mossbushes
but
had
stood
plain
there
for
all
things
of
the
night
to
behold
and
moreover
though
i
could
nowise
have
a
sure
knowledge
concerning
this
matter
yet
did
i
hope
within
me
that
i
should
make
a
sure
hiding
from
the
power
of
the
house
of
silence
did
i
but
go
very
low
among
the
bushes
but
indeed
it
was
like
enough
that
naught
could
give
me
hiding
yet
should
i
lose
no
chance
unto
my
safety
and
because
of
this
i
went
backward
among
the
bushes
and
ceased
to
escape
out
unto
the
westward
and
i
found
presently
that
the
mossbushes
made
but
a
narrow
growth
in
that
path
and
grew
only
for
a
while
by
the
side
of
the
great
road
so
that
i
was
surely
fain
to
keep
nigh
to
the
road
that
i
have
the
covering
of
the
bushes
and
in
a
while
i
found
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
to
bend
inward
at
the
north
of
the
house
of
silence
so
that
it
came
right
horridly
close
unto
the
house
for
here
the
hill
on
which
the
house
did
stand
was
very
abrupt
and
fell
steeply
unto
the
road
and
so
was
that
dreadful
house
stood
up
there
above
me
in
the
silence
as
that
it
did
seem
to
brood
there
upon
the
land
and
this
side
did
seem
truly
as
the
other
and
equal
lone
and
dreadful
and
the
house
was
monstrous
and
huge
and
full
of
quiet
lights
and
it
was
truly
as
that
there
had
been
no
sound
ever
in
that
house
through
eternity
but
yet
was
it
as
that
the
heart
did
think
each
moment
to
see
quiet
and
shrouded
figures
within
and
yet
never
were
they
seen
and
this
i
do
but
set
down
that
i
bring
all
home
unto
your
hearts
also
as
that
you
crouched
there
with
me
in
those
low
mossbushes
there
beside
the
great
road
and
did
look
upward
unto
that
monstrous
house
of
everlasting
silence
and
did
feel
the
utterness
of
silence
to
hang
about
it
in
the
night
and
to
know
in
your
spirits
the
quiet
threat
that
lived
silent
there
within
and
so
shall
you
have
mind
of
me
hid
there
among
the
bushes
and
sodden
and
cold
and
yet
as
you
will
perceive
so
held
in
my
spirit
by
an
utter
terror
and
loathing
and
solemn
wonder
and
awe
of
that
mighty
house
of
quietness
loomed
above
me
in
the
night
that
i
wotted
not
of
the
misery
of
my
body
because
that
my
spirit
was
put
so
greatly
in
dread
and
terror
for
the
life
of
my
being
and
also
you
shall
have
before
you
how
that
i
knew
in
all
my
body
and
soul
that
i
stood
anigh
to
that
place
where
but
a
little
while
gone
there
had
passed
inward
so
dreadful
to
an
everlasting
silence
and
horrid
mystery
those
poor
youths
and
after
that
you
have
minded
you
of
this
you
shall
consider
how
that
the
memory
of
all
my
life
held
dread
thoughts
of
the
monstrousness
of
that
house
and
now
was
i
anigh
unto
it
and
it
did
seem
to
my
soul
that
the
very
night
about
it
held
an
anguish
of
quiet
terror
and
always
my
mind
did
come
back
to
the
sheer
matter
that
i
was
so
anigh
and
this
thing
i
do
say
unto
you
once
and
again
for
truly
as
you
do
see
it
hath
imprinted
itself
deep
into
my
spirit
yet
shall
i
now
cease
from
saying
further
in
this
manner
for
surely
you
shall
never
know
all
that
was
in
mine
heart
and
if
i
cease
not
i
do
but
be
like
to
weary
you
and
so
did
i
hide
and
creep
and
oft
pause
to
a
time
of
shaking
quiet
and
afterward
gather
something
of
new
courage
and
go
onward
and
peer
upward
at
that
monstrous
house
stood
above
me
in
the
night
yet
as
it
did
come
about
i
came
presently
clear
of
that
horrid
place
for
the
road
came
round
again
unto
the
north
and
i
began
that
i
made
a
better
way
through
the
mossbushes
but
never
that
i
grew
to
much
speed
for
i
had
oft
to
go
about
that
i
should
miss
a
naked
part
here
and
another
there
for
truly
there
was
an
abundance
and
bareness
of
rock
so
that
the
bushes
grew
not
so
thick
as
i
could
wish
and
in
the
space
of
five
hours
was
i
clear
of
that
house
and
did
have
a
greater
ease
about
my
heart
but
yet
was
not
free
to
come
to
food
nor
to
slumber
the
both
of
which
i
did
sorely
need
for
i
had
slept
neither
eat
for
a
weariful
time
as
you
do
know
but
first
i
must
go
further
off
from
the
house
and
afterwards
come
to
some
firehole
that
i
should
dry
myself
and
get
warmth
again
into
my
body
which
was
bitter
cold
and
now
that
i
had
come
unto
the
northward
of
the
house
of
silence
there
came
to
me
a
great
wonder
which
bred
in
me
a
mighty
hope
and
gladness
for
as
i
did
go
among
the
bushes
there
broke
sudden
all
around
me
in
the
aether
the
low
and
solemn
beat
of
the
masterword
and
the
throb
of
the
word
was
utter
weak
so
that
one
moment
i
did
say
unto
myself
that
i
heard
and
in
a
moment
that
i
did
not
yet
had
i
no
proper
doubt
in
my
heart
and
i
reasoned
with
myself
and
with
a
great
shaking
of
excitement
and
expectation
upon
me
that
the
masterword
came
not
from
the
great
pyramid
which
should
have
power
to
send
it
as
a
great
force
across
the
everlasting
night
whilst
that
this
that
throbbed
about
me
was
faint
and
scarce
to
be
known
even
unto
the
keenness
of
the
nighthearing
which
was
mine
and
immediately
as
i
crouched
low
there
and
thrilled
with
the
hope
that
was
bred
in
me
lo
there
seemed
to
come
the
far
faint
voice
of
naani
calling
with
a
little
voice
within
my
spirit
and
i
thought
the
cry
to
have
an
utterness
of
supplication
within
it
so
that
i
grew
desperate
to
up
and
go
to
running
yet
did
curb
such
foolishness
and
stayed
very
hushed
to
listen
but
i
heard
no
more
yet
was
shaken
continually
with
the
joy
and
hope
which
this
calling
did
breed
in
me
for
truly
did
it
seem
now
that
i
was
right
that
i
did
determine
to
go
unto
the
north
for
sure
was
i
now
that
the
lesser
redoubt
lay
that
way
in
the
night
and
it
did
seem
plain
unto
me
that
the
house
of
silence
had
put
a
barrier
between
and
had
power
to
withhold
so
weak
a
calling
and
now
had
i
come
beyond
the
barrier
and
i
did
perceive
in
my
heart
how
that
naani
had
called
off
maybe
in
the
sadness
of
despair
yet
had
the
weak
crying
of
her
brainelements
been
held
from
me
by
the
horrid
power
of
the
house
and
surely
as
i
did
think
it
was
well
named
for
it
did
make
a
silence
and
so
shall
you
stay
with
me
in
your
hearts
and
take
to
ourselves
something
of
the
new
gladness
that
held
all
my
being
for
it
did
seem
truly
that
my
bitter
task
and
adventuring
should
not
in
the
end
be
offered
to
uselessness
and
that
i
did
truly
draw
unto
that
far
place
in
the
everlasting
night
where
mine
own
maid
did
cry
for
me
that
i
should
succour
her
and
ever
as
i
went
did
i
hark
but
there
was
no
more
the
low
eating
of
the
masterword
in
the
night
not
at
that
time
and
presently
i
spied
outward
to
the
west
as
it
did
seem
a
good
mile
off
in
the
night
the
shining
of
a
firehole
and
i
began
to
plan
that
i
should
come
unto
that
place
and
have
warmth
and
dryness
and
food
and
slumber
and
in
verity
so
set
was
i
to
the
need
of
these
matters
that
if
there
did
be
a
monstrous
thing
nigh
to
the
fireas
was
so
oft
the
casethen
would
i
give
battle
unto
it
for
neither
my
joy
nor
my
labours
did
serve
to
put
warmth
into
my
body
and
i
must
surely
come
anigh
to
fire
or
die
then
as
i
kneeled
upward
among
the
mossbushes
and
made
to
lay
a
true
course
unto
the
firehole
i
perceived
that
there
came
a
being
along
the
road
unto
my
right
and
i
went
low
into
the
bushes
and
moved
not
for
truly
i
had
seen
that
there
drew
nigh
one
of
the
silent
ones
and
i
made
a
little
place
that
should
let
me
to
see
and
i
spied
out
with
an
utter
caution
and
lo
the
being
came
on
very
quiet
and
with
no
hurry
and
in
a
time
it
went
by
me
on
the
road
and
did
take
no
heed
to
me
yet
did
i
feel
that
it
had
knowledge
that
i
stoopt
there
among
the
mossbushes
and
it
made
no
sound
as
it
went
and
was
a
dreadful
thing
yet
it
did
seem
unto
my
heart
as
that
it
had
no
trouble
of
wanton
malice
to
work
needless
destruction
to
any
and
this
i
crave
strangely
that
you
to
understand
for
it
was
so
to
me
that
i
had
a
quiet
and
great
respect
for
that
thing
and
did
feel
no
hatred
yet
was
very
dreadly
in
fear
of
it
and
it
was
huge
in
size
and
was
shrouded
unto
its
feet
and
seemed
maybe
ten
feet
high
yet
presently
it
was
gone
onward
down
the
road
and
i
was
no
more
troubled
by
it
then
did
i
make
no
waste
of
time
but
set
off
unto
the
firehole
and
kept
so
much
to
shelter
as
i
might
but
was
oft
made
to
run
over
baked
places
ere
that
i
should
come
to
more
of
the
bushes
and
i
came
presently
nigh
unto
the
firehole
and
made
a
pause
and
crept
unto
it
with
a
great
care
and
i
found
it
to
be
in
the
bottom
of
a
deep
hollow
of
the
rock
of
that
part
and
the
rock
was
clear
looking
of
all
living
matters
the
which
did
make
me
to
be
glad
and
i
went
round
about
the
top
of
the
hollow
carrying
the
diskos
very
handily
but
there
was
nowhere
any
living
thing
and
i
feared
not
to
go
downward
into
the
deep
hollow
and
so
unto
the
firehole
which
lay
in
the
bottom
as
you
have
perceived
and
when
i
was
come
there
i
made
a
close
search
of
the
rock
and
found
it
was
very
sweet
and
warm
and
there
were
no
serpents
neither
any
stinging
creatures
so
that
a
certain
comfort
came
upon
my
spirit
then
stript
i
off
mine
armour
and
gear
and
afterward
all
my
garments
so
that
i
stood
naked
there
in
the
hollow
yet
was
that
place
almost
so
warm
as
some
mild
oven
and
i
had
no
fear
to
suffer
from
the
cold
of
the
night
land
but
was
uneasy
lest
that
any
monstrous
thing
should
be
anigh
to
come
to
take
me
so
unawares
now
i
wrung
the
garments
and
spread
them
upon
the
rock
near
unto
the
firehole
where
it
was
hot
and
i
did
rub
my
body
very
brisk
with
my
hands
so
that
i
glowed
into
health
and
had
no
fear
of
a
stiffness
and
afterward
i
did
look
to
my
food
and
drink
and
to
the
matters
in
the
pouch
but
there
had
no
harm
come
to
any
by
reason
of
the
tightness
of
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
that
had
kept
off
the
water
and
i
eat
and
drank
there
as
i
stood
waiting
for
the
garments
to
come
to
dryness
and
i
walked
about
a
little
as
i
eat
for
i
was
restless
to
be
into
mine
armour
swiftly
and
now
i
did
turn
this
garment
upward
of
the
dry
side
and
now
that
but
did
find
them
to
steam
so
that
i
turned
them
many
times
before
they
were
proper
yet
in
truth
they
dried
in
but
a
little
while
and
i
gat
me
into
them
very
swift
and
into
the
armour
and
i
felt
the
strength
and
courage
of
my
spirit
to
come
back
into
me
which
had
gone
outward
somewhat
when
i
did
stand
there
so
naked
and
this
feeling
you
shall
all
have
understanding
of
and
know
that
you
would
have
felt
that
way
likewise
had
you
but
stood
there
in
that
land
in
so
unhappy
a
plight
and
when
i
had
come
into
mine
armour
i
put
my
gear
upon
me
and
took
the
diskos
into
my
hand
and
did
climb
out
of
the
hollow
for
i
would
find
a
more
secure
place
to
my
slumber
and
did
not
dare
to
sleep
in
that
place
for
it
was
beyond
seven
and
thirty
hours
since
that
i
did
have
sleep
though
as
i
do
see
by
my
count
i
have
made
it
to
seem
but
as
five
and
thirty
yet
was
a
part
consumed
in
diverse
matters
that
i
have
not
set
down
and
you
shall
mind
how
bitter
had
been
my
labour
and
weariness
in
all
that
time
and
i
did
know
of
a
surety
that
sleep
must
come
heavily
upon
me
so
that
i
was
sorely
in
need
that
i
should
search
out
a
safe
place
for
i
should
not
be
lightly
waked
until
that
i
had
slept
away
the
tiredness
of
my
heart
and
the
weariful
achings
from
my
body
and
indeed
i
should
mind
you
how
that
i
was
not
yet
come
perfect
from
the
bruising
which
i
had
gotten
from
the
fight
with
the
yellow
thing
and
presently
when
i
had
searched
but
a
little
while
i
did
find
that
a
rock
stood
upward
from
a
great
clumping
of
the
mossbushes
unto
my
left
and
i
went
over
to
the
rock
and
made
a
search
about
it
and
i
found
that
there
was
a
hole
into
the
bottom
part
of
the
rock
and
i
thrust
the
diskos
into
the
hole
and
made
the
blade
to
spin
a
little
so
that
it
sent
out
a
light
but
there
was
no
thing
in
the
hole
and
it
did
seem
a
dry
and
safe
place
for
my
sleep
then
i
turned
me
about
and
went
into
the
hole
with
my
feet
that
way
and
i
found
that
it
was
so
deep
into
the
rock
as
the
length
of
two
men
and
just
so
wide
as
i
could
lie
in
it
without
having
it
to
pinch
me
and
there
i
made
my
bed
in
the
hole
and
went
swift
unto
my
sleep
and
scarce
had
but
a
moment
even
to
think
upon
naani
and
by
this
thing
shall
you
know
how
utter
was
my
weariness
now
i
waked
of
a
sudden
and
was
very
clear
and
refreshed
and
i
crept
to
the
mouth
of
the
hole
and
lookt
out
but
there
was
all
a
quietness
round
about
and
nothing
to
threaten
and
i
found
that
i
had
slept
ten
hours
so
that
i
made
a
haste
to
eat
and
drink
that
i
should
go
forward
swiftly
upon
my
journey
and
at
that
time
as
in
the
time
when
i
did
eat
naked
in
the
hollow
by
the
firehole
i
eat
four
of
the
tablets
and
this
you
shall
understand
to
be
rightly
due
unto
me
in
that
i
had
gone
so
long
fasting
in
that
my
great
journeying
to
come
safe
from
the
hound
and
to
come
past
the
house
of
silence
and
this
shall
seem
but
a
little
thing
to
you
yet
was
it
a
wondrous
important
matter
unto
me
that
had
gone
so
long
with
an
empty
belly
and
was
never
satisfied
and
neither
should
any
be
that
had
eat
so
little
as
i
did
eat
and
made
to
fill
their
belly
always
with
a
drink
of
water
yet
i
doubt
not
but
that
it
did
keep
my
soul
sweet
and
wholesome
and
no
useful
thing
to
the
powers
of
evil
of
the
land
and
when
i
had
made
an
end
of
so
great
a
gorging
and
had
ceased
to
be
drunken
with
water
i
gat
my
gear
upon
me
and
took
the
diskos
into
mine
hand
and
so
went
forth
once
more
towards
the
north
and
presently
i
was
nigh
unto
the
road
again
for
it
did
curve
something
westward
a
space
beyond
and
i
was
sore
tempted
to
go
upon
the
road
for
the
ground
was
rough
and
the
mossbushes
did
catch
my
feet
yet
did
i
stay
among
the
bushes
though
the
road
was
true
and
smooth
by
compare
and
by
this
telling
you
will
perceive
that
i
walked
once
more
upright
and
had
given
over
to
crawl
between
the
bushes
and
in
truth
this
was
so
for
the
land
did
seem
very
quiet
in
all
that
part
and
i
had
less
of
fear
now
that
i
stood
beyond
the
horrid
unease
of
the
house
of
silence
now
after
that
i
had
journeyed
twelve
hours
i
saw
that
i
was
come
upon
the
commencement
of
a
great
and
mighty
slope
as
that
the
world
did
slope
downward
always
towards
the
north
and
i
went
on
again
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
as
i
did
likewise
before
this
at
the
sixth
hour
of
that
days
journey
and
presently
i
perceived
the
road
to
cease
and
surely
this
did
confound
me
as
that
a
man
of
this
age
had
come
to
a
part
where
the
world
did
end
for
you
shall
know
that
the
road
was
that
which
had
seemed
to
go
on
for
ever
and
you
shall
mind
the
way
of
my
life
up
till
that
time
and
so
shall
you
the
better
conceive
of
my
bewilderment
and
as
it
were
a
feeling
of
great
strangeness
unto
one
that
was
overprest
as
you
would
believe
with
strange
matters
yet
truly
was
this
all
as
the
little
book
of
metal
had
told
unto
me
and
so
should
i
have
been
something
prepared
yet
are
we
ever
thus
needing
eyeproof
and
perhaps
it
is
more
proper
that
it
be
so
yet
you
shall
perceive
me
adrift
somewhat
as
to
direction
for
i
had
steered
before
this
time
so
that
i
should
come
to
the
north
of
the
house
of
silence
and
afterward
had
shaped
my
way
by
the
road
but
now
was
i
adrift
as
it
might
be
set
down
in
the
wilderness
and
so
did
i
stand
and
consider
and
presently
did
look
unto
the
far
pyramid
which
was
now
a
great
way
off
in
the
night
and
had
seemed
but
small
by
that
which
i
knew
it
to
be
and
lo
as
i
did
look
i
perceived
that
i
could
but
see
the
high
upperpoint
of
the
light
of
the
great
pyramid
where
did
shine
the
last
light
and
i
was
confounded
afresh
yet
in
a
moment
i
saw
that
the
greatness
of
the
slope
did
account
for
this
but
here
i
should
tell
to
you
that
the
slope
was
nowise
steep
but
did
seem
as
that
it
should
never
cease
and
mayhaps
this
is
clear
unto
you
and
i
perceived
surely
that
the
time
was
come
when
i
should
make
an
utter
parting
from
the
great
redoubt
and
the
thought
came
very
heavy
upon
me
and
in
the
same
time
i
knew
that
the
aether
was
stirred
by
the
emotions
of
the
millions
so
that
i
had
knowledge
they
watched
me
with
the
great
spyglass
and
did
send
word
down
unto
the
hourslips
and
by
this
did
the
millions
know
and
have
a
great
thinking
upon
me
in
that
moment
and
you
shall
perceive
how
utter
lost
and
lonesome
i
did
feel
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
i
did
test
the
compass
to
comfort
me
as
i
did
tell
before
this
and
feared
i
must
sure
forget
when
i
did
come
to
the
proper
place
yet
have
i
minded
me
as
i
did
desire
and
i
saw
now
that
the
night
land
that
i
did
wot
of
was
hid
from
me
by
the
slope
and
i
turned
and
looked
down
the
slope
and
surely
all
before
me
was
utter
wildness
of
a
dark
desolation
for
it
did
seem
to
go
nowhither
but
into
an
everlasting
night
and
there
was
no
fire
down
there
neither
light
of
any
kind
but
only
darkness
and
as
i
did
feel
eternity
and
downward
into
that
blackness
did
the
great
slope
seem
to
go
for
ever
now
as
i
did
stand
there
looking
downward
into
the
dark
and
often
backward
unto
the
shining
of
the
final
light
and
put
to
a
horrid
desolateness
behold
there
came
the
low
beating
of
the
masterword
in
the
night
and
it
did
appear
as
that
it
had
been
sent
to
give
me
courage
and
strength
in
that
moment
and
did
seem
unto
my
fancy
that
surely
it
did
come
upward
unto
me
from
out
of
the
mighty
blackness
into
which
the
great
slope
ran
yet
could
this
have
been
but
a
belief
for
the
aether
doth
have
no
regard
unto
direction
to
show
you
whence
the
spiritual
sound
doth
come
and
this
did
my
knowledge
and
reason
know
full
well
and
i
made
that
i
would
send
back
the
masterword
sending
it
with
my
brainelements
and
so
give
news
unto
naani
how
that
i
did
struggle
to
come
unto
her
yet
did
i
have
caution
in
time
for
in
verity
had
i
sent
the
masterword
then
had
the
evil
forces
of
the
land
wotted
that
i
was
out
and
mayhaps
had
come
swift
unto
my
destruction
and
so
did
i
contain
my
spirit
and
desire
and
made
to
do
wisely
yet
was
i
put
in
courage
by
the
low
beat
of
the
masterword
and
did
listen
very
keen
that
some
message
should
follow
but
there
came
none
neither
did
the
weak
throb
of
the
word
come
about
me
again
at
that
time
and
because
that
i
was
now
grown
more
to
my
natural
state
and
did
feel
that
i
should
indeed
find
the
maid
i
looked
once
more
unto
the
great
pyramid
long
and
eager
and
with
a
solemn
heart
yet
with
no
sign
or
salutation
as
i
was
before
determined
and
afterward
i
turned
and
went
downward
into
the
dark
viii
down
the
mighty
slope
now
i
went
downward
very
quiet
and
slow
into
that
darkness
and
did
make
but
a
cautious
way
for
now
you
shall
know
me
truly
wrapped
about
with
such
a
night
as
did
seem
to
press
upon
my
very
soul
and
such
as
you
shall
never
have
seen
nor
felt
so
that
i
did
seem
lost
even
from
my
self
and
did
appear
as
that
i
went
presently
in
unreal
fashion
and
did
pass
onward
for
ever
and
for
ever
through
everlasting
night
so
that
odd
whiles
i
did
make
to
walk
with
random
as
that
i
stept
no
more
upon
this
earth
but
did
go
offwards
into
the
void
yet
was
this
foolishness
of
the
mind
set
straight
and
proper
each
time
that
it
did
come
about
for
lo
i
did
kick
against
an
upjutting
rock
here
and
fall
upon
a
great
and
unseen
boulder
there
and
so
was
shaken
very
quickly
to
a
sound
knowledge
that
i
trode
the
hard
and
actual
earth
and
had
no
true
dealings
with
unreal
matters
and
ever
i
did
go
downward
and
by
this
only
did
i
have
a
guide
to
my
way
yet
as
you
shall
think
through
reason
of
the
utter
dark
i
made
scarce
a
mile
in
an
hour
or
even
two
full
hours
and
so
grew
bitter
by
reason
of
mine
unableness
to
go
forward
with
a
proper
and
free
stride
but
i
did
think
me
presently
upon
a
thing
that
i
should
do
to
light
my
path
and
to
this
end
i
did
make
the
diskos
to
spin
odd
whiles
and
did
look
down
the
mighty
slope
the
little
way
that
the
strange
glistening
of
the
diskos
did
show
and
so
fixed
my
path
into
mine
inward
remembering
and
would
go
forward
afresh
until
that
i
was
shaken
once
more
by
the
darkness
and
would
fain
to
look
once
again
upon
the
blessedness
of
light
and
make
me
some
knowledge
of
my
way
and
truly
the
light
from
the
diskos
did
seem
astonishing
great
and
this
to
be
because
there
was
so
monstrous
a
darkness
all
about
me
there
forever
and
thereafter
would
i
go
onward
again
until
the
pain
of
my
stumblings
did
bid
me
surely
to
have
that
sweet
shining
once
more
unto
my
path
and
so
shall
you
perceive
my
going
and
sore
and
miserable
was
it
unto
the
heart
and
like
to
shake
the
courage
of
the
spirit
yet
in
verity
i
had
come
through
much
and
did
have
intent
to
give
way
to
no
foolishness
of
thought
and
you
shall
well
believe
that
i
did
make
the
light
not
more
oft
than
i
did
surely
need
for
it
was
no
properness
of
wisdom
to
use
the
power
of
the
diskos
save
for
mine
extremity
now
presently
when
i
had
done
thiswise
through
six
long
and
bitter
hours
and
it
being
now
beyond
the
twentieth
hour
since
i
did
last
slumber
i
sat
me
down
there
upon
the
mighty
slope
in
the
everlasting
dark
and
did
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
made
the
water
and
could
but
feel
and
hearken
whether
i
did
this
thing
right
and
that
and
when
i
had
eat
and
drunk
i
unfolded
my
cloak
and
wrapt
it
around
me
and
placed
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
under
my
head
and
the
diskos
i
took
to
company
me
and
so
fell
swiftly
upon
sleep
yet
did
think
earnestly
but
vaguely
upon
naani
as
i
came
unto
slumber
and
i
slept
all
but
six
hours
and
did
waken
very
sudden
there
in
the
utter
dark
and
i
got
me
to
mine
elbow
and
did
listen
very
keen
for
i
had
waked
immediately
as
that
something
had
touched
me
or
come
nigh
unto
me
and
i
gript
the
diskos
and
listened
but
there
did
not
even
a
little
sound
come
to
me
out
of
all
that
night
and
presently
i
had
more
assuredness
that
naught
did
make
harm
about
me
and
i
sat
me
up
in
the
dark
and
reached
for
my
scrip
and
did
eat
and
drink
there
in
that
utter
night
and
fumbled
somewhat
as
you
shall
think
yet
i
was
done
in
a
while
and
got
my
gear
upon
me
and
the
diskos
into
my
hand
and
so
to
my
feet
and
forward
now
all
that
day
i
did
have
a
strange
unease
of
the
spirit
so
that
i
stopt
oft
to
listen
as
that
my
soul
told
of
something
nigh
unto
me
that
did
follow
very
quiet
yet
did
mine
ears
perceive
nothing
and
so
i
alway
to
go
downward
again
into
the
night
that
held
the
slope
and
here
should
i
tell
how
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventh
hour
after
i
had
eat
and
drunk
and
went
forward
as
ever
upon
my
journey
down
the
mighty
slope
i
did
have
a
very
sore
tumble
against
a
sharp
rock
for
i
put
my
foot
sudden
into
a
small
hole
and
this
did
make
me
to
pitch
and
i
was
utter
shaked
by
the
fall
and
lay
very
quiet
for
a
time
for
the
rock
had
surely
ript
my
body
but
for
the
armour
and
after
that
i
was
something
renewed
of
strength
and
spirit
i
made
that
i
should
go
no
more
upon
my
feet
but
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
thus
should
i
feel
the
way
that
i
went
and
have
a
less
need
of
the
diskos
which
had
not
overmuch
use
to
light
my
way
in
that
i
shone
it
not
often
and
did
guess
more
than
i
did
perceive
as
you
may
think
and
so
i
crept
all
that
day
which
was
a
bitter
way
of
travel
yet
had
i
done
many
a
sore
mile
thus
through
the
night
land
and
when
that
i
had
gone
downward
for
eighteen
hours
and
eat
and
drunk
thrice
i
ceased
from
my
labour
and
did
feel
about
in
the
darkness
that
i
come
to
a
level
place
for
my
rest
and
so
did
find
presently
a
place
not
so
bad
and
did
push
and
cast
away
such
small
boulders
as
had
been
like
to
irk
me
then
did
i
eat
and
drink
and
afterward
composed
me
to
my
sleep
and
had
many
a
thought
of
naani
as
i
did
drift
unto
slumber
yet
also
had
i
memories
of
the
strange
halffear
that
had
been
with
me
all
that
day
as
though
something
went
constantly
near
me
in
the
dark
and
because
of
this
twice
did
i
rise
unto
mine
elbow
and
listen
but
heard
no
sound
to
trouble
me
and
afterward
did
trust
that
i
did
but
fancy
and
so
came
at
last
unto
slumber
that
yet
was
not
overrestful
for
truly
i
did
listen
even
as
i
slept
and
when
i
had
been
asleep
scarce
six
hours
i
waked
again
very
sudden
as
i
had
done
before
and
had
belief
that
something
did
be
anigh
unto
me
and
i
gript
the
diskos
and
did
hearken
yet
was
there
no
sound
that
mine
ears
did
wot
of
neither
aught
that
had
power
to
be
surely
known
of
the
spirit
and
all
that
day
was
as
the
day
before
save
that
about
the
eighth
hour
i
came
near
to
fall
into
some
monstrous
pit
in
the
great
slope
but
did
only
fall
with
my
breast
upon
the
edge
and
so
drew
back
and
presently
did
crawl
all
around
it
in
the
dark
and
come
safe
unto
the
lower
side
yet
shaken
and
put
more
in
trouble
of
spirit
than
before
and
fearful
how
i
should
go
for
i
knew
not
whether
i
had
come
among
such
things
or
whether
i
had
but
few
to
sorrow
me
and
so
you
shall
perceive
that
i
went
overcautious
for
a
great
while
in
all
that
utter
dark
but
did
think
at
last
upon
a
plan
to
go
with
more
surety
and
speed
but
to
this
i
did
need
a
cord
and
surely
i
had
no
cord
upon
me
and
if
a
boy
be
no
boy
that
hath
none
such
about
him
shall
not
the
same
be
said
of
any
man
and
this
i
did
think
as
i
searched
me
for
the
sayings
of
that
day
had
many
that
were
like
to
this
yet
in
the
end
i
did
compass
my
plan
for
i
did
buckle
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
together
and
took
one
of
the
straps
from
the
pouch
and
this
strap
was
long
and
thin
and
well
suited
unto
my
purpose
then
i
fixt
a
stone
into
the
end
of
the
strap
and
buckled
it
there
and
after
that
i
cast
the
stone
before
me
as
i
went
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
i
did
hold
to
the
hither
end
of
the
strap
and
so
was
abled
to
have
something
of
knowledge
whether
there
lay
any
great
deepness
immediately
before
me
and
thiswise
to
strive
that
i
fall
not
down
some
monstrous
cliff
in
the
night
and
so
did
i
go
casting
the
stone
continually
to
my
front
down
the
slope
and
this
you
shall
think
to
be
a
cumbersome
fashion
of
travel
yet
was
i
in
better
case
than
in
all
the
time
since
i
had
begun
to
go
downward
of
the
mighty
slope
in
the
everlasting
darkness
and
at
the
eighteenth
hour
i
did
sleep
and
was
waked
strangely
before
the
sixth
hour
even
as
i
had
waked
before
and
this
did
put
always
upon
me
a
new
wonder
and
unease
yet
did
no
harm
seem
to
come
unto
me
and
i
did
strive
that
i
have
no
needful
trouble
of
mind
but
that
something
was
always
nigh
unto
me
in
the
dark
i
do
truly
believe
yet
have
i
no
knowing
that
it
was
evil
for
it
harmed
not
me
and
three
days
more
i
journeyed
thus
and
did
never
cease
to
creep
downward
weariful
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
the
diskos
i
had
to
my
hip
and
so
shall
you
know
how
i
carried
it
and
by
this
as
you
do
know
i
had
been
on
the
great
slope
six
days
of
utter
dark
and
did
have
no
wotting
but
that
i
went
unto
some
dire
and
dreadful
place
for
surely
i
had
gone
for
ever
downward
a
monstrous
way
and
here
before
i
tell
further
i
must
set
down
how
that
the
cold
was
much
gone
from
out
of
the
air
upon
the
slope
and
the
air
was
grown
as
it
did
seem
very
heavy
unto
my
chest
and
concerning
this
matter
i
should
say
something
for
if
i
do
mind
me
i
have
said
not
overmuch
concerning
the
air
of
the
night
land
and
the
mighty
pyramid
for
truly
i
have
been
so
set
to
tell
my
story
of
all
that
i
did
truly
see
and
adventure
upon
yet
though
i
have
said
but
little
you
will
surely
have
perceived
that
the
air
of
that
far
and
chill
time
was
not
as
the
air
of
this
but
was
thin
and
keen
within
the
night
land
and
lay
not
as
i
do
think
to
a
great
height
above
the
land
but
only
nigh
to
the
earth
and
as
you
do
know
through
my
tellings
there
was
a
wondrous
difference
between
the
air
within
the
mighty
pyramid
and
that
which
lay
without
around
the
base
for
upward
beyond
that
i
did
understand
that
there
was
no
outward
air
that
any
should
breathe
and
so
was
all
the
pyramid
sealed
in
certain
wise
in
all
the
upper
cities
for
ever
and
whether
it
was
sealed
utterly
from
the
outward
air
at
the
base
i
do
not
surely
remember
if
in
truth
that
i
did
ever
bother
my
head
to
such
matters
yet
if
i
be
set
proper
in
memory
and
understanding
we
did
draw
air
from
the
underground
fields
but
whether
they
gat
any
change
or
newness
of
air
from
the
night
land
i
have
no
knowledge
and
do
lament
that
i
have
no
sure
knowing
yet
as
you
shall
believe
i
could
surely
write
an
hundred
books
upon
that
wonder
of
the
future
and
be
still
lacking
in
the
half
of
all
that
there
is
to
be
told
and
so
do
i
try
to
have
courage
to
this
my
task
and
to
have
no
overtrouble
because
that
i
do
tell
but
a
little
of
a
great
tale
and
here
in
this
place
will
i
set
down
how
that
the
peoples
of
the
pyramid
were
greater
to
the
chest
methinks
than
we
of
this
age
but
yet
do
i
have
no
oversurety
in
the
matter
for
well
it
may
be
that
the
reason
of
this
age
doth
blind
within
me
somewhat
the
knowledge
that
i
have
concerning
that
for
in
verity
is
it
not
but
a
natural
thing
to
believe
those
peoples
to
be
great
of
the
chest
so
that
they
should
make
a
proper
dealing
with
the
thin
air
of
that
place
and
that
time
and
yet
as
i
do
strive
to
make
plain
unto
you
because
that
this
thing
should
be
by
the
making
of
my
reason
i
do
the
more
distrust
that
reason
shall
make
foolish
my
knowledge
for
even
a
fool
should
suppose
that
which
i
have
told
and
the
truth
may
be
even
otherwise
yet
that
the
peoples
of
the
upper
cities
had
great
chests
i
do
well
know
for
this
was
a
common
knowledge
even
as
we
of
this
age
do
acknowledge
the
peoples
of
africa
to
be
of
blackness
or
those
of
patagonia
to
be
of
great
stature
and
by
this
one
thing
should
any
know
a
man
of
the
upper
cities
from
a
man
of
the
lower
cities
and
because
that
there
grew
this
difference
among
the
peoples
there
had
been
once
as
any
could
learn
from
the
histories
a
plan
whereby
the
peoples
should
be
moved
upward
and
downward
through
the
great
height
of
the
mighty
pyramid
from
this
city
unto
that
yet
had
it
met
with
great
disfavour
and
was
put
out
of
force
and
this
is
easy
to
be
seen
as
the
natural
way
of
the
human
heart
and
here
it
doth
occur
unto
me
that
it
was
like
enough
to
be
a
plan
for
health
beside
of
training
of
the
mind
that
each
youth
and
maid
was
put
to
travel
through
all
the
cities
of
the
mighty
pyramid
the
which
did
take
three
years
and
two
hundred
and
twentyfive
days
as
i
have
told
before
this
for
by
this
plan
were
they
made
to
breathe
the
air
of
every
height
and
this
mayhaps
unto
the
good
of
their
developing
and
they
also
to
discover
that
air
which
was
best
to
their
need
and
concerning
the
air
of
the
night
land
you
shall
know
that
there
was
in
all
that
land
no
flying
thing
because
that
the
air
was
grown
very
thin
yet
as
the
records
did
show
there
had
once
been
monstrous
flyingbrutes
that
went
over
the
land
in
mighty
bounds
but
this
was
in
a
long
gone
age
and
we
could
but
suppose
that
the
records
gave
truth
and
here
you
shall
know
that
when
the
monstruwacans
did
learn
that
i
would
journey
through
the
night
land
in
search
of
naani
there
had
been
some
foolish
and
wellintended
talk
among
them
that
i
take
a
small
flyingship
that
was
in
the
great
museum
beside
the
models
of
the
great
ships
for
truly
this
machine
was
yet
sound
to
go
for
it
was
made
of
the
grey
metal
of
the
mighty
pyramid
that
did
seem
to
have
no
power
to
cease
yet
in
verity
i
had
no
skill
to
manage
this
neither
had
it
flown
through
an
hundred
thousand
years
so
that
none
did
know
the
mastership
of
that
art
which
did
be
learned
but
by
a
constant
practice
and
oft
made
uneasy
by
fallings
that
did
wreck
the
machine
as
i
did
know
from
the
book
of
flying
and
moreover
as
i
have
told
the
air
of
the
night
land
was
grown
overweak
to
uphold
such
a
thing
which
i
doubt
not
had
made
the
peoples
of
the
pyramid
to
cease
from
flyings
quite
so
much
as
that
they
did
fear
the
forces
of
evil
in
the
night
and
if
that
there
had
been
air
and
skill
sufficient
unto
this
purpose
of
flying
yet
had
i
been
wicked
with
foolishness
that
i
should
work
to
be
hung
upward
in
the
night
for
all
the
evil
of
the
night
land
to
behold
and
though
i
had
gone
up
some
great
way
yet
the
machine
had
surely
made
a
great
noise
in
the
quietness
of
the
eternal
night
as
you
shall
suppose
now
indeed
am
i
gone
weary
that
i
should
need
to
tell
so
much
concerning
the
air
of
that
time
and
place
for
surely
i
do
seem
to
make
this
my
story
as
that
i
did
make
a
lecturing
upon
matters
of
chemistry
and
so
do
i
cast
about
that
i
may
not
bother
to
tell
more
upon
this
matter
yet
in
truth
a
little
more
of
my
thinkings
and
observings
had
i
better
set
down
here
and
so
be
done
with
it
but
you
shall
have
patience
with
me
and
know
that
had
this
my
story
been
no
more
than
an
idle
tale
i
had
been
free
to
make
no
labour
with
such
matters
now
there
doth
a
wonder
come
to
me
why
that
the
road
makers
who
were
of
that
faroff
age
which
was
before
the
age
of
the
mighty
pyramid
did
not
fly
downward
from
the
upper
world
into
the
deep
of
the
monstrous
valley
but
did
instead
build
a
road
yet
it
may
be
that
the
air
of
the
upper
world
had
grown
thin
a
great
age
so
that
they
had
truly
forgot
that
once
man
did
have
power
to
fly
but
even
if
that
they
did
have
proper
machines
to
this
purpose
surely
it
were
a
wondrous
and
fearful
thing
to
fly
downward
an
hundred
great
miles
for
they
surely
to
have
a
dread
that
they
never
to
rise
again
through
so
huge
a
deep
and
moreover
the
downward
world
that
was
the
bottom
of
the
great
valley
was
full
of
monsters
as
was
told
in
the
little
metal
book
and
the
monsters
were
very
strange
and
unknown
and
foreign
to
the
whole
world
that
had
never
come
unto
the
deep
of
the
valley
and
the
valley
had
come
as
you
shall
mind
when
the
earth
did
split
and
this
thing
was
in
truth
like
to
be
thought
that
same
ending
of
the
world
which
all
nations
have
been
taught
to
believe
shall
come
for
in
verity
when
the
world
did
split
and
burst
and
the
oceans
rushed
downward
into
the
earth
and
there
was
fire
and
storms
and
a
mighty
chaos
surely
it
was
proper
to
think
that
the
end
had
come
yet
was
it
in
truth
but
the
beginning
of
hope
of
a
new
eternity
of
life
so
that
out
of
the
end
came
the
beginning
and
life
out
of
death
and
good
out
of
that
which
did
seem
a
dire
matter
and
so
is
it
always
yet
doth
this
go
past
my
first
wonder
which
did
concern
the
wherefore
that
they
made
not
to
descend
in
things
of
flight
yet
maybe
shall
my
reasons
stand
to
show
why
this
was
not
and
again
mayhap
it
did
chance
that
some
were
wild
adventurers
and
did
leap
over
the
edge
of
the
upper
world
having
to
ease
their
flight
certain
contrivings
like
to
parachutes
and
these
you
shall
picture
as
that
you
watched
them
to
leap
and
so
shall
you
see
them
go
downward
into
the
gloom
and
you
shall
see
them
for
maybe
ten
miles
and
maybe
for
twenty
miles
and
afterward
shall
they
be
lost
utterly
in
that
great
deep
and
seen
no
more
of
any
man
for
ever
but
when
the
nations
became
roadmakers
and
came
downward
slowly
to
the
monstrous
deep
of
the
mighty
valley
that
did
split
the
world
then
were
they
come
there
by
millions
and
with
power
sufficient
to
fight
against
the
beasts
and
afterward
to
grow
back
again
to
an
ancient
civilizing
and
so
to
the
building
of
the
great
airships
that
were
yet
shown
in
the
great
museum
of
the
pyramid
and
here
shall
i
cease
from
these
my
thinkings
on
this
matter
for
indeed
who
shall
say
what
did
be
truly
a
reason
for
those
peoples
and
what
was
their
need
and
so
do
i
come
to
no
surety
by
my
wonderings
yet
as
you
do
know
all
things
do
seem
verily
to
go
in
a
circle
for
behold
in
time
they
of
the
mighty
pyramid
were
likewise
held
off
from
the
glory
of
the
airships
and
so
were
gone
backward
a
great
way
according
as
we
do
look
upon
this
matter
and
so
hath
this
been
the
way
always
as
you
shall
know
who
have
studied
and
thought
and
seen
the
true
ways
and
goings
of
life
and
now
will
i
go
forward
in
my
telling
and
here
will
set
down
a
sure
thing
that
i
did
perceive
both
by
mine
ears
and
by
my
fingers
for
as
i
did
make
clear
to
you
but
a
while
gone
there
had
come
a
change
into
the
air
as
i
did
go
downward
of
the
mighty
slope
and
truly
i
was
come
to
a
great
and
new
deepness
even
beyond
that
of
the
wondrous
depth
where
did
stand
the
last
redoubt
so
that
i
was
afar
down
and
in
a
monstrous
night
and
the
air
here
was
of
a
great
thickness
and
abundancy
even
as
it
might
be
the
air
of
this
our
age
or
maybe
more
or
maybe
less
for
who
may
compare
two
matters
with
a
sure
guessing
that
do
have
an
eternity
to
keep
them
asunder
and
because
that
the
air
was
grown
very
strong
and
apparent
it
shall
be
mayhaps
that
it
was
by
reason
of
this
thing
that
the
water
when
i
did
make
it
did
fizz
upward
in
a
moment
very
loud
and
plentiful
and
did
boil
overward
to
the
earth
from
out
of
the
cup
and
wet
upon
my
hand
and
surely
this
thought
did
come
very
keen
to
my
reason
as
i
did
fumble
each
time
of
mine
eating
there
in
the
everlasting
night
and
lonesomeness
of
the
great
slope
and
so
shall
you
have
knowledge
now
of
this
and
that
thing
which
did
come
upon
my
thought
and
of
the
little
and
the
big
wonders
and
all
shall
help
something
to
give
unto
you
the
ache
of
newness
and
bewilderment
that
was
constant
companion
unto
me
now
by
this
time
as
i
have
said
i
was
gone
downward
ever
for
six
great
days
and
i
did
seem
as
that
i
should
presently
come
to
the
middle
of
the
world
for
of
going
downward
there
was
no
end
and
then
when
it
did
be
that
i
was
near
ready
to
believe
this
i
perceived
far
off
in
the
deep
of
the
night
a
little
shining
that
was
yet
weak
and
unsure
and
i
do
not
know
whether
i
can
truly
give
unto
you
the
great
astonishment
and
pain
of
hope
that
did
come
upon
me
so
that
i
grew
sick
in
all
my
being
but
to
behold
once
again
the
blessedness
of
light
and
to
have
help
unto
my
belief
that
i
went
not
downward
to
an
utter
desolation
and
i
stood
upward
from
my
knees
and
did
look
very
earnest
and
surely
it
did
seem
that
a
light
was
there
afar
downward
in
the
night
and
again
it
did
seem
that
i
must
be
plagued
by
my
hopes
and
by
my
fancy
and
that
there
was
nowhere
any
light
and
then
again
i
did
see
it
very
clear
and
not
to
be
mistaken
and
i
had
a
shaking
to
come
upon
me
and
i
gat
me
to
a
run
and
made
a
great
and
mad
speed
down
the
dark
slope
and
lo
i
was
not
gone
any
way
but
i
went
headlong
and
near
brake
myself
and
could
but
hold
my
teeth
together
very
fierce
and
quiet
until
that
the
pain
was
something
gone
from
me
and
afterward
i
gat
me
again
to
mine
hands
and
knees
and
went
slowly
as
before
and
so
for
a
great
hour
or
more
and
did
look
oft
and
alway
the
light
became
more
plain
to
my
sight
but
ever
to
come
and
go
oddlywise
yet
did
i
go
six
hours
before
that
i
was
come
anywise
near
to
it
and
by
this
shall
you
know
how
great
a
space
off
it
had
been
and
lo
when
that
i
did
seem
surely
anigh
unto
it
truly
was
it
still
far
away
in
the
night
and
i
came
not
indeed
near
to
it
until
that
i
was
gone
onward
again
for
three
hours
more
and
all
that
time
did
i
yet
go
downward
into
the
night
but
the
slope
now
did
not
be
so
utter
dark
now
presently
i
made
a
pause
and
stood
upward
to
my
feet
so
that
i
should
the
better
perceive
the
light
and
lo
as
i
did
look
toward
it
i
heard
a
faraway
sound
in
the
dark
as
that
something
did
set
up
a
strange
and
monstrous
piping
in
the
night
and
immediately
i
went
to
mine
hands
and
knees
among
the
stones
of
the
slope
and
kept
myself
low
in
the
darkness
so
that
i
should
be
the
less
plain
to
be
seen
did
any
monster
approach
but
there
came
nothing
to
trouble
me
and
i
went
downward
of
the
slope
for
yet
another
hour
and
all
the
time
that
i
did
go
the
sound
of
the
piping
grew
more
in
the
great
eternity
of
the
night
upon
the
slope
and
by
this
time
was
i
come
truly
near
unto
the
light
but
yet
did
not
behold
it
plainly
for
it
did
burn
beyond
certain
monstrous
rocks
that
stood
between
and
i
went
to
the
left
for
maybe
the
half
of
a
big
mile
and
all
the
while
that
i
did
go
the
piping
made
a
mightier
whistling
in
the
night
and
it
did
seem
presently
as
that
the
earth
sent
forth
the
sound
and
revelry
of
wild
roarings
and
i
went
the
more
silent
and
later
did
kneel
among
three
rocks
and
peered
forth
for
a
while
upon
the
place
before
me
and
now
being
come
nigh
unto
the
lightthough
yet
it
was
not
unhid
from
behind
the
great
barriers
of
the
uprising
rocks
i
perceived
that
i
crouched
within
the
mouth
of
a
mighty
gorge
and
the
left
side
was
a
great
way
off
and
i
saw
it
plain
at
whiles
when
the
light
did
rise
but
the
light
was
to
the
right
and
it
was
so
wondrous
great
that
it
did
make
clear
to
me
that
a
mountain
was
to
that
side
of
the
gorge
and
went
upward
into
the
everlasting
night
as
it
did
seem
for
ever
and
afar
down
the
gorge
i
did
see
the
shinings
of
strange
fires
faint
and
a
great
way
off
and
so
was
i
come
at
last
to
the
bottom
of
the
mighty
slope
yet
the
gorge
also
to
go
downward
but
not
so
great
and
presently
i
did
go
forward
again
and
so
did
open
the
point
of
the
rocks
as
the
sailors
do
say
and
i
saw
now
that
there
gushed
forth
a
great
blue
flame
from
the
earth
and
the
mighty
rocks
stood
about
it
as
that
they
were
olden
giants
groupt
there
to
some
strange
service
and
concerning
this
flame
i
was
not
overmuch
astonished
in
my
reason
for
it
had
seemed
to
me
as
i
drew
anigh
that
the
fire
and
the
sound
should
be
made
by
the
roaring
and
whistling
of
a
burning
gas
that
did
issue
forth
among
the
rocks
yet
truly
though
it
did
be
a
natural
matter
it
was
yet
a
wondrous
sight
and
set
amazement
on
my
senses
for
the
flame
did
dance
and
sway
whitherward
monstrously
and
sometimes
did
seem
that
it
dropt
so
low
as
an
hundred
feet
and
afterward
went
upward
with
a
vast
roaring
unto
the
utter
height
and
did
stand
mighty
and
blazing
maybe
a
full
thousand
feet
so
that
the
far
side
of
the
gorge
was
lit
and
surely
it
was
seven
great
miles
off
or
more
but
yet
did
show
plain
and
wondrous
and
the
light
did
show
me
the
flank
of
the
mountain
that
made
the
right
hand
side
of
the
gorge
to
go
up
measureless
into
the
night
and
so
shall
you
perceive
that
i
stayed
awhile
among
the
rocks
that
were
in
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
that
i
should
gaze
upon
this
thing
but
afterward
i
lookt
this
way
and
that
way
so
that
i
should
have
a
knowing
of
the
place
where
i
was
come
and
it
was
a
wild
and
stark
and
empty
place
as
you
must
perceive
and
the
far
side
did
be
great
miles
off
as
i
did
say
and
everywhere
there
was
abundance
of
rock
and
lonesomeness
and
before
me
there
went
the
great
and
dim
length
of
the
gorge
and
there
were
lights
here
and
lights
there
in
a
great
distance
and
oftas
it
did
seemthe
quiet
dancing
of
lights
in
diverse
places
but
yet
were
these
gone
on
the
instant
and
ever
there
was
a
strong
and
vacant
silence
upon
that
place
and
presently
after
that
i
had
looked
once
more
unto
the
mighty
dancing
flame
and
perceived
nowhere
any
life
around
it
i
went
onward
down
the
quiet
gorge
and
for
a
great
way
as
i
journeyed
was
my
path
lit
by
the
dancing
of
the
blue
flame
and
oft
should
i
seem
to
be
going
but
dimly
among
the
rocks
and
my
shadow
faint
and
long
and
lo
the
flame
would
leap
and
all
the
gorge
come
to
a
wondrous
brightness
and
my
figure
to
shorten
and
the
shadows
to
be
black
and
strong
and
so
shall
you
perceive
how
i
went
and
oft
did
i
turn
me
about
to
behold
the
dancing
of
the
great
light
for
it
was
solemn
to
my
spirit
even
amid
so
much
of
greatness
and
eternity
to
think
upon
that
flame
and
to
conceive
that
it
had
an
utter
age
danced
there
at
the
foot
of
the
mighty
slope
unseen
through
lonesome
eternities
and
this
i
do
tell
unto
you
that
thereby
may
you
have
some
knowledge
of
the
strangeness
and
the
bitter
loneliness
of
that
place
which
in
verity
did
seem
the
expressing
of
all
the
lonesomeness
of
my
wanderings
and
all
the
time
as
i
did
go
downward
of
the
great
gorge
there
sounded
the
blast
of
the
roaring
that
was
presently
afar
to
my
back
and
the
mountain
sides
did
catch
it
here
and
in
that
place
and
sent
it
offwards
with
strange
and
improper
echoings
as
of
a
chill
piping
or
oddwise
as
hushed
whisperings
of
monstrous
creatures
so
that
i
did
oft
stoop
to
hide
a
little
among
the
boulders
for
truly
i
knew
not
but
that
some
unnatural
thing
called
from
the
darkness
of
the
mountain
side
and
for
six
hours
i
walked
onward
thus
and
sometimes
did
hide
having
a
sudden
fear
as
i
have
told
and
presently
in
a
great
while
the
roaring
was
sunk
to
a
far
and
monstrous
piping
but
in
the
end
to
no
more
than
a
far
and
uncertain
whistling
that
yet
did
catch
strange
echoes
in
the
night
and
in
the
end
there
was
only
a
quietness
and
yet
as
you
do
perceive
there
had
been
always
a
silence
in
that
gorge
as
i
have
told
and
this
to
the
despite
of
the
whistling
and
i
do
hope
that
you
have
understanding
with
me
in
this
matter
for
it
was
truly
as
i
have
told
and
there
is
no
contrariness
of
telling
in
this
matter
now
in
all
this
time
that
i
had
walked
in
the
great
gorge
i
had
past
four
of
the
far
lights
that
i
did
see
from
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
the
two
first
and
the
fourth
were
blue
but
the
third
was
green
and
all
did
dance
and
quake
and
sent
fitful
shinings
into
the
belly
of
the
gorge
and
there
came
also
from
them
whistlings
and
from
the
second
one
a
low
and
strange
moaning
noise
and
i
doubted
not
the
gas
did
come
oddly
and
with
trouble
and
i
past
these
things
with
no
great
thought
for
truly
they
were
no
matters
for
notice
after
that
which
i
had
beheld
now
as
you
shall
mind
it
was
surely
in
the
early
third
of
the
seventh
day
of
my
journey
down
the
mighty
slope
that
i
saw
the
first
shining
of
the
monstrous
gas
fountain
and
from
that
time
until
now
had
there
past
maybe
sixteen
hours
and
as
you
do
wot
i
had
eat
not
in
all
my
travel
since
that
i
had
seen
the
light
so
that
i
was
gone
to
a
proper
lack
inward
and
moreover
it
was
full
nineteen
hours
or
more
since
that
i
had
slept
and
all
that
while
had
i
laboured
and
i
ceased
me
from
wandering
and
lookt
about
that
i
should
come
to
a
safe
and
proper
place
for
my
slumber
and
this
i
saw
very
quick
for
there
was
dry
stone
and
rock
everywhere
and
no
failing
of
holes
and
diverse
places
to
my
purpose
so
that
i
was
soon
in
a
little
cave
between
two
mighty
boulders
and
here
i
eat
four
of
the
tablets
for
truly
so
many
were
my
due
and
i
had
not
been
violent
had
i
eat
more
and
afterward
i
made
some
of
the
water
and
it
did
fizz
up
in
a
moment
so
that
i
perceived
that
but
a
good
pinch
made
a
great
cupfull
and
this
i
set
to
the
count
of
the
strong
and
heavy
air
as
i
have
told
which
i
did
think
to
have
a
greater
power
of
chemistry
and
presently
i
slept
having
my
gear
about
me
as
ever
and
the
diskos
to
my
breast
and
as
i
went
into
slumber
i
thought
sweetly
upon
naani
as
i
had
done
indeed
an
hundred
times
since
i
was
come
to
the
hopefulness
of
the
lights
of
the
gorge
now
whilst
i
slept
i
dreamed
that
the
masterword
did
presently
beat
all
about
me
in
the
night
yet
as
i
do
mind
i
waked
not
and
because
that
i
continued
to
sleep
i
have
no
sure
knowing
whether
this
was
truly
a
dream
or
an
happening
and
i
minded
me
upon
it
when
i
waked
but
this
was
after
that
i
had
slept
seven
hours
and
i
could
have
no
sureness
anywise
of
the
matter
but
only
that
i
was
come
safe
through
my
sleep
though
heavy
within
my
head
and
limbs
as
that
the
air
did
call
me
unto
a
further
slumbering
as
is
like
enough
and
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
i
put
my
gear
about
me
and
the
diskos
to
my
hip
for
i
needed
both
my
hands
to
the
task
of
journeying
amid
the
great
boulders
and
i
set
forth
again
down
the
halflight
of
the
mighty
gorge
and
through
eighteen
hours
i
made
a
strong
going
save
when
i
did
pause
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
to
mine
eating
and
by
the
eighteenth
hour
was
come
i
was
very
ready
to
my
food
and
slumber
and
presently
i
was
asleep
in
a
place
of
the
rocks
and
that
day
had
i
past
three
and
twenty
of
the
dancing
gas
fires
and
five
been
like
a
white
fire
but
the
others
blue
and
green
and
all
did
dance
and
made
a
strange
and
uncertain
light
within
the
great
gorge
yet
was
it
a
peaceful
thing
unto
my
spirit
that
there
was
truly
light
as
you
shall
understand
and
i
slept
six
hours
and
waked
and
did
want
more
sleep
as
you
shall
think
but
i
eat
and
drunk
and
put
my
gear
upon
me
and
went
on
downward
of
the
gorge
and
at
the
sixth
hour
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
i
came
to
a
part
where
the
big
gas
fires
did
cease
to
dance
and
there
was
a
certain
darkness
upon
that
place
yet
was
it
not
a
proper
dark
for
there
came
the
glimmer
of
a
flame
here
and
the
glimmer
of
a
flame
there
as
that
little
flames
came
upward
between
the
stones
and
did
vanish
and
come
upward
in
another
part
and
so
did
light
and
die
out
constant
and
forever
amid
the
stones
and
the
boulders
of
that
lonesome
gorge
and
made
a
lowspread
light
so
that
it
did
seem
unto
me
that
strange
shudders
of
light
beat
upward
through
the
dark
of
that
place
and
i
went
onward
and
a
heavy
fume
did
seem
to
hang
in
the
air
and
horrid
gases
to
come
upward
from
the
earth
in
odd
puffings
and
anon
a
light
would
leap
upward
beyond
the
next
stone
and
afterward
vanish
and
there
would
be
an
hundred
thousand
such
upon
every
hand
running
to
and
fore
and
afterward
for
a
moment
an
utter
dark
and
again
the
little
flames
everywhere
so
that
it
did
seem
i
went
one
moment
amid
the
heart
of
a
strange
country
of
fire
and
immediately
through
a
country
of
utter
night
and
this
was
to
me
strange
and
a
peculiar
matter
yet
as
i
do
think
the
gases
did
bother
me
the
more
for
they
did
seem
as
that
they
were
like
to
hurt
mine
health
utterly
for
in
verity
oft
did
i
seem
as
that
i
should
choke
and
breathe
no
more
by
reason
of
the
poison
that
came
upward
from
among
the
stones
and
the
boulders
and
all
that
time
as
they
came
or
went
did
the
little
flames
make
small
phlocks
of
sound
in
the
gorge
as
they
did
flash
or
die
and
the
sounds
did
seem
to
my
likening
as
stones
cast
into
an
utter
silent
pool
for
they
but
made
apparent
the
everlasting
quiet
of
the
gorge
and
afterward
i
came
beyond
this
place
and
you
shall
see
me
going
very
lonesome
among
the
rocks
of
the
gorge
beyond
and
by
this
it
was
come
nigh
unto
the
eighteenth
hour
and
i
did
find
a
place
proper
to
my
slumber
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
was
quickly
gone
over
unto
sleep
and
here
i
should
tell
how
that
i
had
not
an
overfear
of
evil
powers
whilst
i
was
in
the
great
gorge
for
truly
it
did
seem
as
that
nothing
that
ever
did
live
came
anigh
to
that
wild
and
silent
place
of
stone
and
rock
but
that
i
journeyed
through
it
alone
and
was
surely
the
first
that
did
go
that
way
for
maybe
a
million
years
and
this
feeling
that
was
upon
me
i
do
hope
you
to
perceive
and
take
unto
yourselves
and
thus
have
an
understanding
of
my
heart
at
that
time
and
as
you
shall
know
i
went
always
unto
slumber
with
sweet
and
with
troubled
thoughts
of
the
maid
yet
for
a
great
while
i
had
been
put
so
mightily
to
the
labour
of
my
way
that
my
heart
did
suffer
less
at
this
time
than
should
be
thought
and
truly
it
doth
show
me
how
i
was
drawn
unto
that
one
with
all
my
being
that
i
did
surely
think
so
oft
and
sweetly
upon
her
amid
so
many
perils
and
matters
of
horror
and
this
doth
seem
something
strange
to
say
when
that
you
do
consider
that
i
was
adventured
unto
these
same
perils
and
horrors
but
only
for
the
sake
of
the
maid
and
in
six
hours
did
i
wake
as
i
did
strive
alway
to
set
myself
to
do
yet
was
i
very
heavy
and
slow
for
a
little
until
that
i
was
more
properly
come
to
wakefulness
and
surely
as
i
did
think
before
this
was
like
to
be
put
upon
me
by
the
weighty
air
of
the
place
but
yet
it
might
be
that
the
gas
which
did
float
in
the
gorge
was
upon
my
lungs
and
also
as
you
have
perceived
if
but
you
have
attended
my
way
the
air
was
grown
warm
and
oft
were
the
rocks
pleasant
to
the
seat
and
all
of
these
matters
did
contrive
to
make
me
slumbrous
now
presently
the
gas
fires
did
cease
utterly
in
the
gorge
and
i
lookt
downward
along
that
great
place
and
saw
only
a
greyness
but
above
the
greyness
there
was
as
it
did
seem
something
of
a
vague
and
ruddy
shining
in
the
night
and
this
did
wake
me
to
wonder
what
new
thing
lay
before
so
that
i
grew
more
eager
among
the
boulders
and
later
when
i
had
eat
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
and
gone
on
awhile
i
came
to
a
place
where
the
gorge
made
a
quick
turning
unto
my
left
and
at
the
end
of
the
turning
was
a
red
and
glowing
light
that
was
very
great
and
wonderful
so
that
i
was
utter
keen
to
come
to
that
place
that
i
should
discover
what
made
the
shining
and
the
place
where
i
was
come
then
was
very
dark
because
that
i
was
nigh
under
the
mighty
wall
of
the
mountain
of
the
right
side
of
the
gorge
yet
above
as
it
did
seem
to
me
there
was
a
far
red
upward
glowing
in
the
night
then
did
i
go
forward
very
fast
and
presently
in
a
good
while
i
discovered
that
i
drew
near
to
a
second
great
turning
that
went
to
the
right
and
about
the
seventeenth
hour
i
came
nigh
unto
the
second
great
turning
and
here
did
i
put
caution
upon
me
and
crept
for
a
while
among
the
dark
rocks
of
that
place
that
i
should
come
to
a
sight
of
that
which
made
the
monstrous
red
shining
and
presently
i
was
beyond
the
corner
of
the
mountain
and
did
look
downward
into
a
mighty
country
of
seas
and
the
burning
of
great
volcanoes
and
the
volcanoes
did
seem
as
that
they
burned
in
the
seas
and
the
country
was
full
of
a
great
ruddy
light
from
the
volcanoes
and
so
shall
you
perceive
me
there
among
the
rocks
that
did
all
stand
upward
strange
and
bold
and
silent
in
the
red
and
monstrous
glare
of
the
light
and
i
as
it
did
seem
the
one
thing
of
life
in
all
that
desolation
and
eternity
of
rock
and
stone
there
in
the
end
part
of
the
great
gorge
and
i
peered
forth
into
the
wonder
of
the
light
and
was
full
of
thrillings
and
fancies
that
i
was
surely
come
to
the
place
where
the
lesser
redoubt
had
been
builded
and
immediately
i
knew
that
this
was
not
so
for
surer
had
not
naani
told
how
that
they
were
in
a
land
of
darkness
and
if
this
did
be
so
truly
how
wondrous
and
dread
a
way
had
i
yet
to
go
if
that
this
country
of
seas
and
mighty
volcanoes
stood
between
surely
it
did
seem
to
me
then
as
that
i
must
wander
searching
unto
the
worlds
end
and
so
shall
you
be
company
unto
me
there
with
my
trouble
and
my
thoughts
and
the
immediate
wonder
and
strange
glory
of
that
mighty
country
ix
the
dark
pyramid
now
in
two
hours
more
i
was
come
clear
down
out
of
the
gorge
and
stood
in
that
country
and
for
all
that
i
did
feel
fresh
troubled
and
bewildered
yet
was
i
rejoiceful
as
you
may
believe
in
the
surprising
light
and
splendour
of
that
sudden
land
and
before
that
i
had
come
down
out
of
the
great
gorge
i
had
stood
high
within
the
mouth
thereof
and
lookt
well
out
over
the
mighty
country
and
i
had
counted
seven
and
twenty
great
volcanoes
and
this
doth
not
take
heed
of
two
monstrous
ranges
of
firehills
that
burned
afar
off
something
unto
my
right
neither
doth
it
take
account
of
an
hundred
thousand
lesser
places
of
fire
and
truly
it
did
seem
a
very
land
of
fire
and
water
for
there
was
a
small
firehill
stood
within
a
sea
as
it
did
seem
no
more
than
a
little
mile
from
that
place
where
i
did
stand
and
maybe
a
score
to
the
back
of
it
spread
all
about
and
here
shall
i
do
proper
to
tell
concerning
the
seas
for
there
were
of
these
that
i
did
count
at
that
time
three
that
were
small
and
a
mighty
sea
that
went
onward
for
ever
into
the
red
light
of
the
firehills
so
that
it
was
gone
utterly
out
of
my
sight
and
did
show
no
ending
and
there
rose
up
out
of
the
seas
islands
and
on
the
islands
volcanoes
but
in
other
parts
the
firehills
did
come
upward
straightly
from
the
sea
and
over
the
near
sea
as
it
did
seem
there
lay
a
plentitude
of
steam
as
that
the
sea
did
boil
at
whiles
and
in
diverse
places
and
there
did
seem
to
me
as
it
were
within
the
red
atmosphere
of
that
place
as
that
there
were
a
muttering
thunder
low
and
constant
shaking
the
air
now
from
that
distance
and
now
from
this
and
this
did
i
judge
to
be
the
voices
of
the
firehills
speaking
with
the
fire
that
lived
in
them
and
you
shall
conceive
how
utter
new
was
all
this
unto
me
for
there
was
in
that
country
a
constant
voice
of
the
energy
of
life
so
that
the
worldnoise
of
this
our
age
was
even
there
again
and
with
a
keen
and
undoubted
apparentness
and
the
more
so
some
ways
than
now
and
here
shall
i
set
down
more
closely
the
things
that
were
ready
to
my
gaze
and
first
that
it
did
much
attract
me
there
was
a
huge
and
blackened
mountain
unto
the
left
of
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
and
the
mountain
did
go
upward
into
the
night
maybe
fifteen
and
maybe
twenty
miles
and
there
was
a
mighty
peaked
volcano
that
grew
out
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
so
high
up
as
five
miles
as
i
did
guess
that
height
and
this
was
upon
the
far
side
and
above
this
there
was
a
second
maybe
nine
or
ten
great
miles
up
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
that
hung
afar
upward
and
as
that
this
were
not
great
wonder
enough
there
did
burn
and
glow
two
other
mighty
firehills
at
an
utter
height
upon
the
left
crest
of
that
black
mountain
and
these
were
upward
so
monstrous
a
way
as
that
they
did
seem
to
make
strange
and
smouldering
suns
within
the
night
and
truly
as
you
shall
perceive
this
was
a
wondrous
thing
and
below
these
upward
firehills
there
rose
up
from
the
earth
vast
mountains
of
ash
and
burned
stuff
that
had
been
cast
forth
by
these
perched
volcanoes
and
had
poured
downward
unto
the
earth
throughout
eternity
and
so
to
build
grey
and
sombre
monuments
unto
the
dreadful
glory
of
time
and
to
my
right
there
was
always
sea
and
sea
and
the
red
blazing
of
the
firehills
but
unto
my
left
there
were
mighty
forests
and
there
rose
upward
here
and
in
that
place
as
that
they
were
beyond
the
great
woods
monstrous
firehills
and
so
do
you
take
from
me
something
of
that
first
impressing
upon
my
brain
and
sense
and
after
that
i
had
come
down
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
great
gorge
as
i
did
tell
a
little
while
gone
i
came
upon
a
pause
for
surely
which
way
was
the
way
proper
unto
my
search
and
i
lookt
about
for
a
great
while
and
afterward
did
climb
back
into
the
gorge
and
called
myself
foolish
that
i
had
not
thought
to
map
my
way
ere
i
came
down
and
when
i
was
come
up
into
the
gorge
again
lo
i
saw
that
there
was
but
one
way
that
i
should
go
for
truly
as
i
have
said
there
was
only
the
seas
unto
my
right
but
unto
the
left
where
the
shores
did
meet
the
seas
there
seemed
so
far
as
mine
eyes
did
tell
to
me
a
clear
way
for
a
space
and
mayhap
when
i
had
come
so
far
i
should
even
find
a
further
way
to
go
forward
and
so
did
i
descend
again
unto
the
country
of
the
seas
as
i
did
ever
call
that
redshining
country
of
water
and
fire
and
by
that
i
was
come
again
from
the
height
of
the
gorge
it
was
four
and
twenty
hours
since
that
i
did
last
sleep
so
that
i
was
fain
that
i
should
put
into
some
nook
and
come
to
slumber
as
you
shall
well
believe
and
i
found
me
a
neat
and
proper
place
where
three
great
trees
grew
about
a
little
basin
of
rock
that
was
very
dry
and
warm
and
here
after
that
i
had
eat
three
of
the
tablets
and
drunk
some
of
the
waterthe
while
that
my
belly
did
yearn
as
ever
for
proper
eatingstuffi
made
my
bed
in
the
little
basin
of
the
rock
and
lay
me
down
and
did
begin
to
think
awhile
upon
naani
but
was
gone
over
to
sleep
before
that
i
was
aware
and
lo
i
was
suddenly
awake
and
did
find
that
i
swam
in
a
hot
water
and
a
mercy
i
did
think
was
it
that
i
was
not
drowned
as
i
did
sleep
and
i
gat
me
to
my
feet
and
the
basin
was
full
of
water
hot
and
steaming
and
pungent
to
the
taste
as
well
i
did
know
and
i
perceived
now
that
the
water
poured
in
from
a
smoothed
slit
upon
the
far
side
and
did
come
with
a
strange
gurgling
and
bubbling
so
that
i
conceived
some
deep
well
to
boil
and
thus
to
drive
upward
this
water
into
the
basin
and
glad
was
i
that
it
did
not
boil
as
it
came
forth
and
surely
now
that
i
was
upon
the
dry
land
and
did
consider
i
did
quickly
suppose
that
the
water
had
poured
forth
at
seasons
into
the
basin
for
an
eternity
of
time
and
afterward
did
go
back
by
fissures
in
the
bottom
of
the
basin
and
this
to
happen
as
i
soon
did
find
a
little
beyond
the
length
of
every
hour
and
indeed
the
basin
to
empty
slow
as
i
did
watch
now
being
much
wetted
i
stript
off
mine
armour
having
before
this
dipt
out
mine
effects
from
the
hot
pool
and
so
did
come
down
to
the
naked
flesh
and
i
found
a
place
where
the
rock
was
hot
and
here
i
did
spread
my
garments
and
whilst
that
they
came
to
dryness
i
gat
me
into
the
hot
pool
and
had
a
very
pleasant
bathing
and
did
have
no
great
fear
of
any
dangerous
thing
for
as
it
did
seem
i
had
surely
left
all
such
behind
within
the
night
lands
yet
did
i
have
the
diskos
upon
the
pool
edge
to
my
hand
for
i
had
no
proper
assurance
in
this
matter
yet
as
it
did
prove
there
were
many
monstrous
beasts
in
that
country
but
never
did
i
feel
the
nearness
and
horrid
power
of
any
evil
force
for
these
as
i
do
conceive
were
congregate
and
gathered
about
the
mighty
pyramid
being
attracted
thereto
by
the
great
spiritual
essence
of
so
wondrous
a
multitude
of
humans
gotten
so
close
in
one
spot
even
as
sharks
do
come
after
the
ship
that
hath
bullocks
within
yet
how
that
the
evil
powers
were
given
entrance
unto
this
state
of
our
life
i
have
no
sure
knowing
yet
have
i
put
forward
certain
thoughts
on
this
matter
in
an
earlier
place
and
more
than
such
thinkings
is
surely
vanity
for
there
is
no
certainty
in
my
reasoning
concerning
the
thing
now
presently
was
my
clothing
dry
yet
before
this
i
had
come
out
from
that
bath
which
truly
was
nigh
all
gone
backward
into
the
earth
and
i
dressed
me
again
and
got
my
armour
upon
me
and
afterward
was
i
in
a
more
lightsome
state
of
the
mind
and
yet
very
ready
to
come
again
unto
my
sleep
and
this
i
did
and
had
six
hours
more
beside
the
pool
and
once
was
wakened
somewhat
by
the
gruntling
and
bubbling
noise
of
the
water
that
was
made
as
the
pool
did
fill
time
and
again
and
when
the
six
hours
were
gone
i
waked
very
well
fitted
in
my
senses
and
feelings
to
go
forward
again
through
that
redlighted
country
and
this
i
did
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
now
all
that
day
i
went
forward
at
a
great
pace
and
the
nameless
woods
were
unto
my
left
and
the
shores
of
the
seas
unto
my
right
and
oft
did
i
find
that
the
trees
grew
even
into
the
water
so
that
oft
did
i
go
forward
among
the
trees
and
a
very
wonderful
thing
was
this
to
me
that
never
had
known
before
in
all
my
life
until
i
was
come
into
that
country
how
that
a
glad
and
wild
mystery
doth
live
among
forest
trees
for
there
was
no
such
strange
wildness
among
the
groves
of
the
underground
fields
though
a
solemn
beauty
in
plenty
and
the
scent
of
the
woods
was
sweet
unto
my
spirit
as
you
shall
wot
now
all
the
time
that
i
did
go
there
was
the
shore
unto
my
right
but
alway
to
my
left
and
around
me
ofttimes
as
i
did
say
the
great
forests
and
as
i
did
go
lo
there
was
life
in
all
those
darksome
woods
and
living
eyes
did
peer
out
odd
whiles
upon
me
and
afterward
go
backward
into
the
dark
so
that
i
wotted
not
whether
to
fear
or
to
have
no
heed
of
trouble
yet
naught
did
come
anigh
to
me
to
make
any
hurt
and
thrice
in
that
day
did
i
come
to
little
firehills
that
burnt
redly
and
sent
out
fire
and
noise
so
that
i
heard
their
trouble
each
time
through
the
forest
before
that
i
was
come
to
them
and
about
each
was
there
a
deadness
and
desolation
where
the
fire
had
killed
the
big
trees
yet
as
i
did
observe
the
quick
life
of
little
plants
did
grow
more
nigh
as
that
they
were
born
and
lived
between
the
times
of
the
firebursts
and
this
i
do
take
it
that
you
perceive
and
in
that
one
day
i
past
thirty
and
seven
boiling
springs
but
whether
they
boiled
truly
i
do
have
no
knowledge
only
that
they
sent
out
a
great
steam
ofttimes
and
some
did
make
a
strong
roaring
noise
so
that
to
hear
them
afar
off
in
the
forests
was
to
think
odd
times
that
some
wild
beast
roared
strangely
now
when
the
eighteenth
hour
was
come
i
sat
me
down
as
i
had
done
upon
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
and
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
which
here
did
fizz
very
rich
and
quick
and
afterward
i
lay
down
to
my
slumber
for
i
was
greatly
wearied
and
i
had
chosen
a
place
against
a
great
rock
which
was
so
that
no
creature
might
come
upon
me
from
behind
and
i
came
easy
upon
sleep
but
yet
i
did
fix
it
upon
me
that
i
slumber
only
with
the
body
for
i
did
know
by
the
shining
of
the
eyes
in
the
darksome
woods
that
strange
creatures
abode
in
the
mighty
forests
and
ere
i
was
gone
over
to
sleep
i
thought
upon
naani
as
i
had
done
much
all
that
day
as
though
her
spirit
did
hover
near
unto
mine
and
did
strive
pitiful
to
speak
with
me
and
this
i
set
out
to
you
that
you
shall
know
how
it
did
seem
unto
me
in
my
thoughts
and
fancyings
and
as
i
lay
there
i
put
a
blessing
upon
her
and
a
determination
into
my
heart
that
i
make
a
more
desperate
speed
of
my
going
if
that
might
be
so
that
i
come
the
sooner
to
that
strange
and
unknown
place
in
the
dead
world
where
did
stand
the
lesser
refuge
and
i
was
then
asleep
in
a
moment
and
lo
sudden
i
was
awake
and
lovely
was
the
brightness
of
that
country
that
did
show
me
in
a
moment
my
danger
and
did
not
keep
me
suspend
in
fearful
doubt
as
did
the
grey
darkness
and
strange
shadows
and
lights
of
the
night
land
for
i
saw
on
the
instant
that
i
got
me
to
mine
elbow
how
that
certain
things
did
crouch
within
the
borders
of
the
trees
no
more
than
a
score
paces
off
and
i
perceived
in
a
moment
that
my
spirit
had
been
given
knowledge
and
had
wakened
me
and
i
stared
the
while
that
i
did
grip
the
diskos
and
i
saw
that
there
were
six
squat
men
that
were
humpt
at
the
neck
and
shoulder
and
they
did
crouch
all
there
in
a
row
and
were
something
hid
by
the
shadows
and
i
perceived
that
they
watched
me
and
the
eyes
of
the
men
did
shine
like
the
eyes
of
beasts
and
so
shall
you
know
somewhat
of
the
strange
terror
that
came
upon
me
yet
had
i
the
diskos
and
mine
armour
and
though
my
heart
did
shake
a
little
yet
was
my
spirit
assured
to
conquer
now
i
gat
me
to
my
feet
and
had
the
diskos
ready
within
my
hand
and
behold
i
could
not
see
the
humped
men
for
they
were
gone
from
that
place
yet
never
did
i
see
them
go
though
i
had
kept
my
gaze
very
steadfast
upon
that
part
where
they
did
hide
and
as
you
shall
understand
i
was
near
ready
to
believe
that
there
had
been
nothing
there
within
the
border
of
the
wood
yet
truly
i
knew
that
the
men
with
the
humps
had
been
there
as
i
had
seen
now
i
looked
presently
and
found
that
i
had
slept
five
hours
and
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
as
i
did
stand
there
watchful
and
afterward
drank
some
of
the
water
and
so
was
ready
to
go
forward
again
for
i
was
grown
very
anxious
to
be
gone
from
that
place
and
did
have
no
knowledge
but
that
those
strangely
humpt
men
were
but
a
little
way
off
among
the
trees
and
might
come
upon
me
in
a
moment
or
further
that
they
did
go
to
call
an
army
of
other
humped
men
to
my
destruction
and
after
that
i
was
ready
and
had
my
gear
secure
upon
me
i
set
off
at
a
great
stride
and
did
hold
the
diskos
very
handy
and
lookt
this
way
and
lookt
that
way
and
all
the
while
made
onward
with
speed
for
truly
i
was
grown
so
lean
and
hard
that
it
did
seem
to
me
that
i
had
power
to
outpace
those
men
or
aught
else
of
their
kind
and
all
that
day
through
thirty
great
hours
did
i
go
forward
at
that
stride
and
did
always
watch
and
at
every
sixth
hour
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
a
little
of
the
water
and
went
onward
again
and
so
did
i
hope
that
i
was
lost
from
those
humped
men
yet
though
i
did
hope
my
faith
was
not
this
wise
for
twice
and
thrice
did
it
come
to
me
that
there
went
things
through
the
woods
to
my
left
all
that
day
and
did
keep
always
to
a
level
with
my
speed
yet
were
always
hid
and
as
you
shall
believe
this
did
be
a
very
shaking
thing
to
my
heart
and
did
make
my
hope
of
but
little
account
now
because
that
i
had
no
faith
to
company
my
hope
i
was
not
easy
to
have
slumber
until
that
i
was
come
to
a
place
proper
and
safe
and
so
as
i
have
told
i
went
onward
through
thirty
great
hours
and
in
truth
in
all
that
while
i
did
find
nowhere
that
did
seem
to
fit
my
need
and
lo
about
the
end
of
the
thirtieth
hour
i
perceived
that
there
was
water
ahead
besides
the
water
of
the
sea
that
was
ever
to
my
right
and
i
thought
maybe
that
the
sea
did
go
inward
at
that
part
of
the
land
but
it
was
otherwise
for
when
i
was
gotten
to
that
place
i
found
that
a
river
came
into
the
sea
and
did
come
out
of
all
the
country
that
lay
unto
my
left
and
in
the
mouth
of
this
river
there
was
a
small
island
and
surely
i
did
look
across
to
the
island
and
think
it
a
refuge
from
the
humped
men
that
did
surely
play
dog
upon
my
going
yet
truly
this
was
but
an
idle
thought
and
my
need
was
that
i
should
come
to
some
way
to
cross
over
the
river
that
i
go
forward
beside
the
great
sea
which
did
stretch
onward
as
it
did
seem
for
ever
before
me
upon
the
far
side
and
i
knew
not
how
to
go
across
for
i
had
no
power
to
swim
and
had
i
swum
there
were
surely
monsters
in
that
great
and
warmflowing
river
as
you
shall
believe
and
i
went
upward
of
the
riverbank
that
i
might
come
to
some
place
where
the
river
did
narrow
and
surely
i
had
been
like
to
walk
a
mighty
distance
to
this
purpose
but
that
i
came
soon
to
a
second
river
that
did
enter
the
first
not
a
mile
above
the
shore
of
the
sea
so
that
as
you
do
perceive
there
was
the
sea
to
one
side
of
me
and
this
second
river
unto
the
other
and
the
first
river
before
me
and
thus
was
i
sorely
perplexed
as
any
had
been
truly
that
was
in
a
like
trouble
yet
as
it
did
chance
the
need
to
go
forward
and
the
danger
of
the
humped
men
put
wit
into
me
so
that
i
lookt
about
for
a
tree
that
was
fallen
and
there
were
many
yet
great
so
that
i
was
much
wearied
and
something
strained
of
the
spirit
before
that
i
gat
two
little
trees
unto
the
water
now
when
this
was
done
i
made
me
a
rough
pole
of
a
young
treeplant
and
afterward
i
lashed
the
two
trees
together
with
my
belts
and
straps
and
so
had
somewhat
of
a
raft
and
you
shall
picture
that
all
the
time
as
i
did
go
about
this
business
i
was
very
heedful
lest
the
humped
men
should
come
upon
me
ere
that
i
was
gone
free
upon
the
water
and
this
constant
heeding
did
double
the
labour
of
my
work
as
you
shall
perceive
yet
in
the
end
it
was
done
and
i
ready
to
adventure
over
the
river
and
so
i
did
push
off
with
the
pole
and
i
pusht
and
paddled
maybe
the
half
of
an
hour
for
indeed
it
was
all
a
clumsy
contriving
and
mayhap
i
the
more
so
in
my
labours
yet
presently
i
was
come
so
far
over
that
i
drew
nigh
to
the
island
and
it
did
seem
a
wise
and
proper
thing
that
i
should
have
my
slumber
there
and
afterward
go
onward
to
the
farther
shore
and
this
i
did
and
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
as
ever
i
lay
down
to
sleep
and
by
this
time
it
was
three
and
thirty
hours
since
last
i
did
slumber
so
that
i
was
bitterly
awearied
and
i
had
a
great
and
restful
sleep
for
truly
the
island
did
seem
a
very
safe
place
and
in
verity
i
came
to
no
harm
though
i
was
as
a
dead
man
for
nine
great
hours
and
so
shall
you
perceive
my
weariness
and
when
i
was
come
proper
awake
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
afterward
made
an
end
of
my
voyage
and
then
did
take
back
my
belts
and
straps
from
binding
the
trees
and
so
forward
again
upon
my
way
and
no
more
fearful
of
the
humped
men
for
surely
i
did
think
i
had
left
them
all
upon
the
far
shore
of
the
river
though
afterward
i
minded
me
that
they
might
grow
likewise
upon
the
two
sides
but
yet
was
i
only
discovered
by
those
upon
the
one
as
you
do
know
and
all
that
day
i
went
very
swift
and
past
many
strange
matters
and
did
coast
upon
wonders
oft
and
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
did
i
eat
and
drink
as
ever
and
between
the
eighth
and
the
fourteenth
hours
did
i
come
past
two
mighty
firehills
that
made
all
the
country
to
tremble
with
their
noise
and
four
times
did
monstrous
creatures
pass
by
me
but
i
was
swift
hid
and
came
to
no
harm
and
oft
as
i
did
go
were
my
thoughts
upon
the
dear
maid
that
i
journeyed
to
save
from
destruction
yet
as
you
must
see
always
were
my
thinkings
brought
sharply
unto
my
going
so
that
scarce
was
i
ever
set
off
to
ponder
upon
naani
but
that
there
came
some
danger
or
wonder
to
give
me
heed
to
my
way
and
because
of
this
as
you
have
learned
i
was
more
put
to
plan
free
of
the
instant
trouble
and
peril
of
my
way
through
all
that
mighty
journey
than
to
have
quiet
chance
for
thoughts
of
love
unto
mine
own
yet
truly
was
not
my
journey
one
whole
thought
of
love
unto
naani
and
that
peril
made
oft
dumb
my
brain
was
but
the
truer
song
unto
my
maid
and
at
times
i
was
among
trees
but
oft
did
go
past
unnumbered
boiling
springs
and
small
firehills
and
oft
was
the
air
full
of
the
noise
of
the
little
firehills
and
the
roar
of
the
boiling
springs
but
there
came
no
harm
unto
me
and
a
thousand
times
did
i
perceive
things
that
had
life
and
i
made
a
very
cautious
way
though
with
a
great
speed
and
cleverness
of
going
that
made
my
heart
glad
and
oft
did
i
come
to
parts
where
a
great
life
held
the
trees
and
green
stuff
did
flourish
exceedingly
and
the
air
rich
and
full
and
wondrous
sweet
so
that
i
was
fain
to
think
how
that
in
some
faroff
time
it
might
be
that
our
childrens
children
should
come
down
unto
this
country
when
the
upper
valley
of
the
night
land
was
grown
to
an
utter
chill
and
lacking
of
air
and
here
build
them
a
new
refuge
if
indeed
any
should
come
clear
of
the
evil
forces
and
the
monsters
that
did
live
about
the
mighty
pyramid
in
the
night
land
yet
how
should
they
come
clear
of
those
things
so
that
this
is
as
you
do
perceive
no
more
than
a
thought
that
did
rise
vaguely
in
me
and
yet
again
who
shall
say
what
may
be
and
onward
i
did
pass
and
i
do
mind
me
how
that
i
saw
the
lower
fires
of
that
country
to
burn
very
fierce
and
this
i
set
to
the
richness
of
the
air
but
yet
with
no
surety
of
knowledge
and
do
but
tell
the
same
that
you
shall
see
the
oddments
of
thought
that
went
oft
across
my
brain
and
so
have
so
much
knowledge
as
i
concerning
this
and
that
now
a
little
before
the
eighteenth
hour
was
come
i
came
out
from
among
the
trees
and
the
sea
was
downward
of
a
great
cliff
unto
my
right
for
i
had
gone
upward
for
a
long
and
weary
hour
and
i
did
see
now
a
thing
that
made
me
to
be
cautious
and
yet
that
did
hold
my
heart
to
go
swiftly
to
perceive
the
thing
for
it
was
very
strange
and
i
went
forward
quickly
yet
with
a
wise
care
and
so
was
come
presently
more
nigh
and
i
perceived
that
the
thing
was
in
part
a
high
rock
very
tall
and
pointed
and
maybe
an
hundred
feet
high
but
afterward
i
did
find
it
to
be
more
and
there
was
a
monstrous
great
thing
upon
the
top
of
the
rock
that
did
seem
very
strange
and
i
stopt
and
lookt
and
afterward
went
forward
again
and
so
for
a
time
until
that
i
was
but
a
little
way
off
and
now
i
saw
that
there
did
seem
to
be
a
mighty
long
rock
laid
across
the
topmost
part
of
the
upstanding
rock
and
yet
had
a
very
strange
and
shapely
appearance
and
did
seem
upon
the
underpart
to
be
as
that
i
had
lookt
before
upon
it
and
upon
the
upper
part
there
grew
trees
and
green
things
even
as
these
did
grow
upon
odd
ledges
of
the
upstanding
rock
yet
for
the
most
the
rock
was
very
stark
as
that
a
blast
had
blown
upon
it
and
made
it
bare
now
when
i
had
lookt
for
a
while
i
bethought
me
that
this
should
be
a
safe
and
proper
place
for
my
slumber
if
that
i
had
power
to
come
safe
to
the
top
and
when
i
had
thought
this
thing
i
began
at
once
to
climb
up
the
rock
and
i
found
that
the
rock
was
very
high
so
that
in
a
while
i
was
come
a
great
way
off
the
earth
and
yet
was
not
come
to
the
top
of
the
rock
and
because
that
i
was
awearied
i
lookt
about
for
a
safe
place
to
mine
hand
and
lo
there
was
a
shelf
of
the
rock
very
nigh
that
went
inward
a
little
to
the
side
and
i
gat
me
to
this
ledge
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
presently
i
slept
and
scarce
had
thought
of
naani
in
the
moment
of
my
slumbering
for
a
great
weariness
was
upon
me
the
which
i
do
think
to
have
come
by
reason
that
i
was
not
yet
proper
rested
from
the
task
of
the
day
that
was
gone
before
that
one
now
i
waked
very
sudden
maybe
seven
hours
after
and
i
had
knowledge
within
me
that
my
spirit
did
wot
of
some
nigh
danger
and
i
gat
upward
from
the
rock
very
quiet
and
had
the
diskos
ready
in
my
hand
and
i
lookt
swift
about
me
in
the
moment
that
i
did
wake
yet
did
see
nothing
for
there
was
naught
on
the
ledge
with
me
and
i
crept
to
the
edge
and
lookt
downward
and
lo
i
did
see
that
there
came
up
the
rock
two
humped
men
and
they
did
climb
very
swift
and
silent
and
i
perceived
that
they
smelled
me
and
came
to
destroy
me
and
i
made
ready
the
diskos
to
do
battle
and
ceased
not
to
look
downward
and
i
saw
how
that
the
humped
men
did
seem
to
be
humpt
by
reason
of
their
being
so
monstrous
thick
and
mighty
of
the
neck
and
the
shoulder
as
that
they
had
been
human
bulls
and
i
saw
that
they
were
very
strong
and
by
the
speed
of
their
climbing
i
knew
they
were
swift
and
so
did
i
make
steady
my
attention
and
my
heart
to
the
saving
of
my
life
for
truly
i
did
know
that
i
should
be
dead
in
a
little
or
they
now
i
stept
back
a
space
from
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
had
the
diskos
very
ready
for
it
was
needful
that
i
should
kill
one
of
those
brute
men
speedy
that
i
have
no
danger
that
one
take
me
in
the
back
whilst
that
i
fight
with
the
other
then
in
a
moment
it
did
seem
there
came
upward
of
the
rock
edge
the
great
and
brutish
face
of
the
man
and
in
that
moment
that
i
slew
him
i
did
note
curiously
how
that
he
had
large
teeth
upon
each
side
of
the
mouth
and
was
aware
that
he
had
come
so
quiet
as
a
great
cat
and
in
the
backward
parts
of
my
brain
i
bethought
that
even
thus
maybe
was
primal
man
so
that
a
strange
and
secondary
questioning
and
wondering
did
live
in
that
part
of
me
and
i
did
learn
from
these
scarce
conscious
reasonings
that
i
was
of
belief
the
thing
was
truly
a
man
but
very
crude
and
dangerous
and
surely
it
is
strange
that
i
had
all
this
thought
in
that
little
moment
but
in
verity
so
it
was
though
i
doubt
not
but
i
bettered
it
with
after
thoughts
when
a
while
had
gone
now
the
first
man
died
ere
his
great
haired
breast
was
come
upward
over
the
rock
and
he
sank
back
and
sagged
and
fell
dully
and
i
heard
him
bodge
downward
from
rock
to
rock
very
lumbersome
and
so
in
a
moment
was
silence
then
did
i
look
this
way
and
that
way
of
the
ledge
for
the
second
humpt
man
was
not
yet
upon
me
and
i
feared
that
the
pause
did
mean
a
cunning
mischief
and
strategy
and
when
a
little
time
had
past
and
all
the
while
i
was
ready
with
the
diskos
and
naught
did
come
upward
to
harm
me
i
stept
very
soft
to
the
edge
of
the
rockledge
and
lookt
downward
but
there
was
nowhere
any
thing
to
see
now
for
a
little
moment
i
did
think
that
the
brutish
man
had
run
off
being
feared
by
the
death
that
i
did
deal
unto
the
first
yet
i
put
this
from
me
at
once
for
i
did
wot
that
such
a
creature
did
not
be
like
to
fear
in
such
wise
but
was
rather
set
to
some
horrid
cunning
of
attack
as
i
did
fear
and
was
somewhere
below
me
among
the
holes
of
the
great
rock
then
i
did
think
sudden
that
he
might
be
gone
upward
so
that
he
should
come
down
upon
my
back
and
i
lookt
upward
of
the
mighty
rock
but
did
see
naught
and
afterward
i
stoopt
forward
a
great
way
beyond
the
edge
so
that
i
should
perceive
whether
the
man
did
hide
beneath
and
behold
he
was
there
below
me
and
crouched
under
the
rockshelf
ready
to
his
spring
and
in
that
moment
he
made
unto
me
with
so
mighty
a
leap
as
any
tiger
should
give
and
he
came
half
over
the
edge
and
gript
the
diskos
by
the
handle
in
an
instant
and
surely
i
had
lost
that
trusted
weapon
or
been
pulled
over
and
cast
into
the
depth
but
that
the
diskos
did
spin
and
the
earthcurrent
did
make
live
the
handleas
was
intendedsave
where
the
grip
was
set
and
lo
the
man
gave
loose
the
handle
very
swift
for
it
had
burned
and
shaken
the
creature
sore
and
i
staggered
back
with
the
effort
i
had
made
to
withhold
the
diskos
and
the
brutish
man
came
upward
again
over
the
rock
edge
and
leapt
at
me
yet
he
gat
me
not
for
i
sprang
unto
my
right
and
made
a
blow
with
the
diskos
even
as
i
did
leap
and
the
blow
came
something
short
but
yet
harmed
the
humpt
man
with
a
gash
upon
the
belly
very
sore
and
horrid
among
the
great
brown
hairs
of
the
man
and
immediately
he
sprang
after
me
but
i
smote
full
at
the
face
so
that
he
leaped
back
from
the
strange
roar
and
blaze
of
the
diskos
and
yet
was
harmed
for
he
gat
not
right
free
of
the
blow
but
did
be
cut
very
sore
on
the
mighty
and
haired
arm
now
seeing
that
he
was
something
feared
of
the
weapon
i
ran
in
upon
him
and
smote
again
at
the
face
yet
was
the
man
gone
out
of
my
reach
before
that
the
blow
did
reach
for
truly
he
was
quick
as
a
panther
and
immediately
he
did
leap
unto
the
ending
of
the
ledge
where
it
did
join
upon
the
rock
and
he
caught
the
living
rock
between
his
two
hands
and
truly
the
rock
must
have
been
splitten
there
for
he
tore
out
a
monstrous
lump
so
great
near
as
my
body
and
did
run
upon
me
with
the
rock
above
the
head
of
him
now
i
perceived
i
should
be
smashed
in
a
moment
if
that
i
did
not
slay
the
man
very
quick
for
so
mighty
was
he
that
he
did
leap
this
way
and
that
way
after
me
as
though
the
great
rock
did
cumber
him
no
more
than
it
had
been
but
a
light
matter
and
you
shall
perceive
that
i
leapt
this
way
and
that
way
to
avoid
the
man
and
twice
did
strike
him
but
yet
was
feared
to
brake
the
diskos
upon
the
rock
which
the
man
did
use
as
a
shield
each
time
that
i
did
make
a
blow
and
all
the
while
i
did
act
to
escape
when
that
the
man
should
cast
the
rock
as
i
did
conceive
at
the
first
to
be
his
intent
yet
truly
it
was
as
that
he
had
no
wotting
that
a
rock
may
be
thrown
for
he
strave
only
to
come
at
me
with
the
rock
that
he
should
crush
me
as
with
a
monstrous
club
and
in
verity
what
should
a
man
do
against
so
horrid
an
attack
and
time
and
oft
did
i
leap
now
to
the
right
and
now
to
the
left
and
again
in
a
moment
i
did
cut
the
humpt
man
but
the
blow
was
something
turned
off
by
the
great
rock
in
the
hands
of
the
man
yet
so
strange
and
mighty
was
the
power
of
the
diskos
that
it
shore
away
a
small
portion
of
the
rock
and
did
come
to
no
hurt
in
itself
and
surely
i
had
presently
failed
in
wind
and
limb
because
of
the
leapings
and
chargings
that
i
did
make
and
because
of
the
weight
of
the
armour
that
was
not
overmuch
yet
to
be
considered
but
that
i
fainted
not
was
by
reason
of
the
wondrous
hardness
and
leanness
that
i
was
grown
to
with
so
constant
a
journeying
and
strait
living
for
the
tablets
did
keep
the
strength
in
a
man
though
truly
they
eased
not
the
yearnings
of
the
belly
and
lo
even
the
brutish
man
did
grow
weary
and
the
hot
breath
and
bodystink
to
come
from
him
and
surely
who
shall
wonder
for
always
he
did
rush
to
and
fro
upon
me
with
the
monstrous
rock
to
crush
me
and
sudden
i
leapt
unto
the
right
of
the
man
thinking
within
me
that
i
did
perceive
a
chance
that
i
should
cut
him
upon
that
side
but
truly
he
was
less
awearied
than
i
did
know
for
he
came
very
sharp
upon
me
and
had
me
between
him
and
the
wall
of
the
rock
and
surely
i
had
no
room
to
make
escape
and
had
died
in
a
moment
but
that
i
made
a
sudden
sham
toward
the
left
with
the
diskos
as
that
i
should
leap
that
way
and
in
the
same
instant
i
did
go
to
the
right
with
a
strong
bounding
and
immediately
did
come
in
upon
the
humpt
man
from
that
side
and
i
put
my
fortune
of
life
to
the
stroke
and
stood
anigh
to
the
man
and
i
smote
him
across
the
middle
part
before
that
he
did
wot
of
my
intent
and
the
blow
slew
the
man
very
surely
and
did
nigh
cut
the
mighty
creature
in
twain
and
surely
he
fell
half
leaping
even
as
he
died
so
that
the
monstrous
rock
that
was
in
the
hands
of
the
brutish
man
did
crash
down
almost
upon
my
feet
and
i
leapt
very
high
that
i
should
escape
the
thundering
of
the
rock
for
in
verity
i
was
near
slain
in
that
last
moment
of
the
life
of
the
humpt
man
but
yet
i
lived
and
came
free
of
death
and
did
have
a
relief
of
happiness
about
my
heart
as
you
shall
believe
yet
truly
i
was
much
shaken
and
a
little
weakness
took
me
so
that
i
was
fain
to
go
down
upon
the
rockshelf
that
i
have
back
my
strength
and
presently
i
was
grown
steady
again
and
i
took
my
gear
and
did
haste
down
the
rock
and
so
was
come
presently
to
the
earth
again
and
i
saw
the
first
of
the
humpt
men
that
i
did
slay
lying
very
quiet
a
little
off
from
the
bottom
of
the
rock
so
that
i
went
round
upon
the
other
side
to
avoid
the
man
for
it
was
no
pleasure
to
mine
eyes
or
to
my
heart
and
truly
it
did
trouble
me
always
to
make
a
death
and
when
i
was
come
round
upon
the
other
which
was
the
seaward
side
of
the
rock
i
perceived
that
i
was
yet
shaken
and
i
remembered
that
it
were
wise
to
eat
and
drink
and
rest
a
little
before
that
i
did
go
further
upon
my
way
now
as
i
did
sit
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
rock
i
looked
upward
at
the
strange
crown
thereof
and
until
that
time
i
had
been
taken
up
with
the
fight
and
with
gazings
this
way
and
that
to
see
whether
there
came
others
of
the
humped
men
to
work
me
an
harm
but
now
that
i
was
given
some
ease
of
the
mind
and
of
the
body
i
saw
plainly
that
i
knew
the
thing
that
lay
upward
upon
the
rock
for
the
shape
had
been
something
strange
and
halfknown
to
me
even
before
that
moment
as
that
i
had
a
vague
knowledge
concerning
it
but
yet
with
no
surety
and
now
truly
i
did
know
in
a
little
instant
that
the
thing
was
one
of
the
olden
flyingships
the
which
as
you
shall
mind
there
were
certain
in
the
great
museum
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
surely
i
was
ready
to
wonder
why
that
i
had
not
seen
the
thing
plain
before
that
moment
yet
was
this
like
to
be
because
that
there
was
a
shadow
upon
the
other
side
of
the
great
rock
but
upon
this
side
there
was
a
little
firehill
a
way
off
to
the
cliff
edge
and
this
did
throw
a
warm
light
that
made
a
glimmer
upon
the
dull
metal
of
the
ships
bottom
which
was
uncovered
to
my
sight
and
was
surely
of
that
same
deathless
grey
metal
that
made
the
great
redoubt
and
yet
as
you
shall
believe
even
as
i
said
this
thing
to
my
mind
that
the
strange
matter
upon
the
top
of
the
rock
was
truly
one
of
the
olden
airships
i
did
feel
that
i
should
be
proper
to
doubt
for
it
was
a
very
wondrous
thing
to
perceive
a
thing
common
to
man
in
that
utter
strange
country
and
after
that
i
was
gone
so
far
off
from
the
mighty
pyramid
yet
in
verity
i
did
know
in
my
heart
that
it
was
indeed
that
which
i
did
perceive
it
to
be
and
i
did
stand
and
walk
to
and
fore
and
look
upward
constant
for
i
was
very
keen
that
i
look
well
upon
it
and
truly
as
i
did
look
from
this
place
and
from
that
place
it
was
scarce
a
thing
for
wonder
that
i
had
not
wotted
it
to
be
an
air
vessel
for
there
were
great
trees
and
abundance
of
earth
and
living
matters
upon
the
topmost
side
of
the
ship
so
that
none
could
easy
perceive
it
to
be
aught
save
a
great
and
desolate
rock
that
did
lie
upon
the
other
rock
yet
truly
it
was
as
i
have
told
and
presently
i
did
make
to
climb
upward
of
the
great
rock
that
i
should
come
to
the
air
vessel
to
enter
it
but
yet
was
this
not
proper
for
i
had
surely
no
duty
save
to
go
forward
forever
until
that
i
found
the
maid
but
yet
did
i
spend
a
little
while
to
this
searching
of
the
ship
and
i
do
but
set
down
that
which
i
did
and
with
a
serious
spirit
and
truly
as
it
doth
here
occur
to
me
i
do
be
ever
seeming
a
serious
young
man
as
you
maybe
shall
have
grown
to
think
but
yet
was
i
to
a
dread
and
serious
business
and
the
strain
did
be
too
great
upon
me
and
the
trouble
too
much
prest
upon
my
heart
to
give
me
much
of
laughter
as
you
do
surely
perceive
and
so
you
to
give
me
your
ear
and
your
understanding
for
indeed
before
that
i
did
lose
mirdath
my
beautiful
one
i
was
not
overgrave
but
so
young
and
joyous
as
any
now
it
took
me
a
great
time
to
go
upward
of
the
rock
for
it
was
so
monstrous
steep
and
high
yet
presently
was
i
come
nigh
under
the
bottom
of
the
ship
and
here
i
did
perceive
that
she
had
been
sore
battered
in
that
faroff
age
when
she
did
come
upon
the
rock
for
surely
as
i
did
perceive
the
peak
of
the
rock
was
through
the
bottom
of
the
ship
so
that
the
metal
was
burst
this
way
and
that
and
very
plain
to
be
seen
in
some
parts
but
in
other
places
the
earth
and
growing
matters
did
make
a
hiding
and
after
that
i
had
climbed
this
way
and
that
way
i
perceived
that
i
must
come
to
the
topmost
part
by
the
plants
that
did
hang
over
and
grow
downward
and
after
that
i
had
pulled
upon
them
to
know
that
they
were
strong
to
hold
me
i
went
upon
them
and
was
soon
to
the
top
of
the
ship
yet
truly
i
might
so
well
have
been
upon
the
earth
for
the
ship
was
covered
above
by
the
earth
and
dust
of
a
monstrous
age
of
years
so
that
i
was
like
to
need
much
time
to
dig
downward
unto
the
ship
and
because
of
this
i
considered
a
little
while
and
afterward
made
no
more
to
search
her
but
did
go
downward
again
that
i
should
come
once
more
to
my
journey
yet
as
you
shall
think
it
was
with
a
queer
thrilling
of
the
heart
and
with
strange
thoughts
upon
the
end
of
those
that
did
come
maybe
to
a
bitter
and
lonesome
dying
in
that
ship
of
the
air
in
that
faroff
time
when
she
did
fly
and
surely
it
did
seem
to
me
as
i
went
downward
of
the
great
rock
how
that
the
flyingship
had
been
there
for
an
hundred
thousand
years
and
that
mayhaps
the
sea
did
live
all
about
the
rock
in
that
age
and
truly
this
was
no
improper
thing
to
think
for
it
was
like
that
the
sea
had
been
monstrous
high
and
great
in
those
days
so
that
the
rock
was
but
a
little
island
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
now
was
the
sea
gone
small
from
a
great
sea
to
lesser
seas
and
this
through
an
eternity
of
years
and
always
as
it
doth
seem
to
me
had
the
ship
lain
upon
the
rock
and
lookt
quiet
and
silent
over
the
change
and
wonder
and
the
lonesomeness
of
all
that
country
of
fire
and
water
for
ever
but
how
the
airship
did
come
upon
the
rock
how
shall
i
know
save
maybe
it
doth
seem
as
that
she
might
have
flown
low
over
the
sea
in
that
olden
age
and
come
hard
upon
the
rock
because
maybe
there
was
one
to
the
helm
that
did
steer
unwittingly
and
again
it
shall
well
be
otherwise
and
i
do
but
set
down
mine
odd
thoughts
and
such
as
they
be
they
have
no
especial
use
save
that
they
do
show
to
you
the
different
workings
of
my
mind
at
that
time
as
i
did
go
downward
and
so
to
set
you
the
more
in
possession
of
all
that
i
did
have
knowledge
of
and
presently
i
was
come
again
to
the
earth
and
did
go
forward
with
a
great
speed
so
that
i
should
waste
no
more
of
that
day
yet
oft
did
i
think
upon
that
ship
hid
there
upon
the
mighty
rock
under
the
wondrous
quiet
ashes
of
eternity
and
i
went
eighteen
hours
walking
and
in
all
that
time
i
did
see
no
more
of
the
humped
men
yet
three
times
was
i
put
in
a
sudden
danger
for
there
went
past
me
thrice
between
the
fourteenth
and
the
seventeenth
hours
great
flying
monsters
that
were
winged
very
ugly
and
did
go
as
i
thought
in
a
great
bounding
rather
than
that
they
did
fly
proper
as
doth
a
bird
yet
i
suffered
no
hurt
from
these
for
i
was
swift
to
hide
between
the
great
boulders
that
were
very
plenty
in
that
part
but
no
trees
for
i
was
gone
now
past
the
forests
of
trees
there
being
none
since
that
i
had
gone
through
a
very
shallow
river
that
i
came
to
about
the
thirteenth
hour
and
this
had
i
waded
and
sounded
my
path
with
the
staff
of
the
diskos
but
i
had
kept
mine
armour
upon
me
lest
there
be
things
even
in
water
so
shallow
that
might
bite
and
work
harm
upon
me
but
i
gat
through
pretty
quick
and
had
no
hurt
done
me
now
i
had
eat
as
ever
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
and
by
that
the
eighteenth
hour
was
come
i
was
nigh
again
unto
a
forest
that
came
down
to
the
shore
that
went
alway
upon
my
right
and
i
to
be
very
sore
and
wearied
as
you
shall
know
for
i
had
fought
very
desperate
after
my
waking
and
afterward
climbed
the
great
rock
and
then
again
to
journey
so
that
it
was
by
this
nigh
to
one
and
twenty
hours
since
that
i
did
sleep
and
surely
i
lookt
this
way
and
that
way
constant
and
did
see
no
place
proper
to
my
slumber
but
afterward
i
considered
i
did
be
a
fool
to
lack
such
for
truly
the
trees
were
plentiful
and
i
could
climb
a
great
one
and
strap
my
body
safe
and
so
have
a
sure
bed
for
my
rest
and
i
did
this
thing
and
went
upward
into
a
great
tree
and
did
tie
my
body
to
the
tree
with
my
belts
yet
i
eat
and
drank
before
that
i
went
up
the
tree
now
when
i
was
fast
upward
in
the
tree
and
had
made
a
bed
upon
a
monstrous
branch
and
had
the
diskos
ready
upon
my
hip
so
that
it
should
not
fall
but
be
nigh
to
my
hand
i
lay
a
little
while
thinking
upon
naani
and
i
went
not
over
to
sleep
immediately
which
was
strange
yet
mayhaps
because
that
my
bed
was
so
uncertain
and
i
considered
very
gravely
how
that
it
was
a
monstrous
long
while
since
that
i
did
hear
the
masterword
from
the
dear
maid
and
truly
i
was
come
a
dreadful
way
from
mine
home
which
was
the
mighty
pyramid
for
i
had
gone
onward
for
ever
through
five
and
twenty
great
days
of
travel
and
was
not
yet
come
to
any
place
that
did
appear
like
to
be
that
place
where
the
maid
did
abide
and
it
did
seem
that
i
might
even
wander
onward
in
that
great
country
of
fire
and
water
for
a
time
beyond
all
that
i
had
before
gone
and
this
thought
did
put
a
great
weight
of
trouble
and
weariness
upon
my
heart
for
the
maid
had
been
in
sore
need
of
me
and
i
did
feel
sudden
to
be
all
adrift
in
the
wilderness
but
before
this
time
it
had
seemed
as
that
i
surely
went
aright
and
mayhaps
your
sympathy
shall
tell
you
just
how
i
to
feel
in
the
heart
and
after
that
i
had
lain
there
very
awkward
and
thought
upon
all
matters
i
minded
me
that
i
would
try
the
compass
again
upon
the
morrow
but
had
no
great
hopes
of
the
machine
yet
did
be
willing
to
try
aught
to
see
where
i
had
gotten
to
and
truly
as
it
did
come
to
my
mind
if
that
the
compass
did
point
a
little
as
i
did
wot
it
was
used
to
point
in
the
lesser
redoubt
then
in
verity
i
was
surely
come
something
more
anigh
to
that
unknown
place
of
the
world
than
i
did
dare
to
believe
and
this
to
be
plain
to
you
then
a
little
time
did
pass
in
which
i
did
wake
and
sleep
and
wake
and
sleep
a
little
but
with
no
surety
of
sleep
but
as
that
i
was
very
tired
of
the
heart
and
did
but
lie
too
wearied
to
come
properly
to
sleep
and
odd
whiles
i
did
lie
with
mine
eyes
half
to
open
and
did
look
very
dreamful
upward
among
the
dark
branches
of
the
tree
as
they
did
show
black
and
pretty
against
the
redness
of
the
shining
that
came
from
the
sea
for
there
was
stood
a
great
and
brightburning
firehill
in
that
part
of
the
sea
that
lay
off
the
shore
from
me
and
above
the
glaring
of
the
firehill
there
was
the
deep
night
that
did
brood
for
ever
above
in
a
monstrous
black
gloom
of
eternity
and
did
make
the
red
smoke
of
the
volcano
to
show
deep
and
mighty
and
thunderousseeming
afar
up
in
the
great
dark
and
the
red
and
shining
smoke
did
but
show
the
utter
hugeness
of
the
night
that
had
been
upon
the
world
through
the
great
ages
and
in
verity
as
i
did
lie
there
so
dreamful
it
did
come
to
me
afresh
how
wondrous
strange
was
mine
adventure
and
how
that
i
did
lie
warm
and
alive
in
a
country
of
red
light
and
smoking
seas
and
truly
as
i
did
remember
and
consider
there
was
a
great
and
lost
world
above
me
upward
through
the
dark

maybe
an
hundred
and
fifty
great
miles
up
in
the
grim
night
and
this
thing
did
strike
me
very
solemn
as
i
did
lie
and
i
do
trust
that
you
conceive
how
that
there
was
in
truth
afar
above
in
the
eternal
and
unknown
night
the
stupendous
desolation
of
the
dead
world
and
the
eternal
snow
and
starless
dark
and
as
i
do
think
a
cold
so
bitter
that
it
held
death
to
all
living
that
should
come
anigh
to
it
yet
bethink
you
if
one
had
lived
in
that
far
height
of
the
dead
world
and
come
upon
the
edge
of
that
mighty
valley
in
which
all
life
that
was
left
of
earth
did
abide
they
should
have
been
like
to
look
downward
vaguely
into
so
monstrous
a
deep
that
they
had
seen
naught
mayhaps
save
a
dull
and
utter
strange
glowing
far
downward
in
the
great
night
in
this
place
and
in
that
and
surely
as
you
shall
have
seen
i
have
set
the
great
deep
of
the
valley
to
be
maybe
an
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
night
for
as
you
do
mind
it
was
conceived
that
the
valley
of
the
night
land
was
an
hundred
miles
deep
and
mayhap
to
be
more
and
i
had
come
from
that
place
downward
of
the
mighty
slope
and
of
the
gorge
a
very
great
way
yet
in
verity
i
do
believe
in
my
heart
this
measuring
was
utter
wrong
for
i
think
the
deep
to
have
been
monstrous
beyond
these
miles
that
i
do
give
yet
have
i
no
proving
of
this
belief
and
do
set
it
down
for
no
more
than
it
is
now
presently
i
had
ceased
from
these
vague
thinkings
and
half
dreamings
and
was
gone
truly
to
sleep
yet
nowise
did
i
sleep
very
strong
but
did
seem
to
come
anigh
to
wakefulness
this
time
and
that
and
as
it
did
chance
this
was
mayhaps
a
very
good
thing
for
my
life
for
i
did
presently
come
awake
more
surely
and
did
turn
on
the
great
branch
for
there
was
a
noise
in
the
air
that
was
not
the
noise
of
the
great
firehill
and
the
noise
did
grow
very
heavy
and
lumbersome
and
in
a
moment
there
came
seven
humped
men
running
among
the
trees
as
that
some
monstrous
thing
did
pursue
and
immediately
they
were
beneath
the
tree
in
which
i
did
lie
so
that
a
great
fear
came
upon
me
and
i
loosed
the
belt
from
the
branch
that
i
should
be
free
to
fight
and
directly
upon
this
i
saw
that
the
men
did
leap
upward
into
the
tree
beneath
me
but
not
as
that
they
did
wot
of
me
or
make
to
come
at
me
but
as
that
they
did
pay
a
great
heed
to
some
creature
or
happening
that
was
far
off
among
the
trees
and
surely
the
noise
did
seem
to
come
from
that
part
and
did
grow
loud
and
mighty
and
the
humped
men
did
all
crouch
very
silent
and
did
make
no
noise
or
motion
one
to
the
other
but
were
quiet
upon
the
lower
branches
and
as
i
did
look
now
more
to
my
ease
i
perceived
that
they
had
each
a
great
stone
and
bloody
that
did
seem
as
that
it
were
split
to
a
certain
sharpness
even
as
a
stone
doth
break
very
natural
and
they
carried
the
stone
under
this
arm
or
under
that
arm
so
that
they
had
their
hands
free
to
all
matters
and
alway
the
noise
did
come
the
more
anigh
and
i
saw
that
a
humped
man
did
come
running
from
among
the
trees
and
did
run
beneath
that
place
where
the
seven
humped
men
did
be
on
the
branches
but
they
made
no
sign
to
the
man
to
save
him
yet
truly
it
was
very
plain
that
some
monster
pursued
the
man
and
immediately
i
saw
how
this
thing
was
for
the
humped
man
upon
the
ground
did
not
run
so
fast
as
might
be
and
i
conceived
that
he
did
act
to
make
some
creature
to
come
after
him
to
pass
under
the
men
within
the
tree
and
surely
this
thing
did
prove
to
be
for
there
came
very
quick
a
great
and
ugly
thing
that
had
an
ugly
way
of
putting
down
the
feet
and
did
have
seven
feet
to
each
side
which
was
very
strange
and
the
back
was
as
that
it
were
horny
and
the
belly
of
the
thing
did
seem
to
brush
heavy
upon
the
earth
and
it
grunted
as
it
went
and
shook
the
earth
with
the
weight
of
it
so
that
a
monstrous
noise
came
from
it
upon
so
hasty
a
journey
and
i
did
wot
that
it
was
not
such
a
thing
as
did
properly
pursue
after
matters
of
food
but
did
rather
eat
of
that
which
did
need
little
haste
but
a
monstrous
strength
to
gain
and
that
it
did
so
make
after
the
man
was
in
truth
because
that
it
had
been
wounded
and
made
fierce
for
indeed
there
came
blood
from
the
creature
from
great
wounds
upon
the
back
but
how
these
were
made
i
could
not
know
in
that
instant
and
it
did
go
under
the
tree
in
which
i
was
hid
and
in
that
moment
when
it
past
under
the
tree
the
seven
humped
men
did
leap
out
of
the
branches
and
did
catch
to
the
brute
by
the
great
horns
of
the
spine
and
i
saw
that
the
wounds
were
in
the
joints
of
the
spine
as
was
plain
when
the
back
did
work
with
the
going
of
the
creature
and
the
seven
humped
men
took
the
sharp
stones
from
under
their
arms
and
did
strike
very
brutal
in
the
wounds
that
were
in
the
joints
of
the
spine
and
the
creature
roared
and
cried
and
went
onward
into
the
trees
at
a
great
speed
and
in
all
the
time
that
it
ran
the
humped
men
ceased
not
to
strike
with
the
stones
and
sudden
when
it
was
gone
a
distance
off
it
did
roll
very
swift
over
upon
the
back
first
to
the
right
as
that
it
would
go
that
way
so
that
the
humped
men
did
leap
off
upon
the
other
side
and
immediately
the
creature
rolled
to
that
side
and
there
ran
clear
of
the
brute
only
four
of
the
humped
men
so
that
i
knew
that
three
were
slain
and
afterwards
they
that
lived
ran
beyond
the
beast
and
gat
up
into
a
second
tree
and
the
one
that
was
chased
did
entice
the
creature
to
follow
and
so
did
tease
it
once
more
to
pass
beneath
the
other
men
and
they
very
swiftly
again
to
the
back
of
the
creature
and
so
from
my
sight
striking
with
the
great
stones
and
the
beast
bellowing
very
loud
and
piteous
and
how
many
of
the
humped
men
there
were
to
the
beginning
of
that
strange
hunting
i
know
not
but
surely
there
were
few
that
lived
to
the
end
and
surely
there
were
such
things
as
this
thing
in
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
again
was
it
thus
in
the
end
and
i
did
ponder
this
a
little
while
as
i
did
sit
upon
the
great
branch
and
hearken
unto
the
sound
of
the
hunting
that
was
now
gone
a
great
way
off
and
was
presently
beyond
my
hearing
and
afterward
i
gat
me
to
the
earth
and
did
look
this
way
and
that
way
to
see
that
no
beast
was
anigh
neither
any
of
the
humped
men
and
afterward
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
when
i
had
gat
this
far
to
a
readiness
for
my
going
i
minded
me
that
i
should
try
the
compass
again
as
i
did
intend
and
surely
the
machine
did
point
between
the
north
and
the
south
upon
the
westward
arc
even
as
naani
had
told
unto
me
yet
as
it
did
seem
with
somewhat
more
of
a
southward
pointing
than
she
had
made
me
to
think
and
because
of
this
telling
of
the
compass
a
great
ease
came
upon
my
spirit
for
surely
was
not
this
but
a
sure
sign
that
i
did
go
direct
unto
that
hidden
place
of
the
world
where
the
lesser
refuge
did
abide
but
yet
was
not
come
overclose
so
that
the
pull
of
the
mighty
earthcurrent
of
the
great
redoubt
was
something
stronger
than
in
the
place
where
was
the
little
pyramid
and
all
this
did
i
think
very
swift
to
myself
and
had
a
glad
uplifting
of
the
heart
as
you
do
perceive
so
that
i
went
forward
upon
my
journey
with
a
great
stride
and
did
scarce
fear
any
strange
thing
that
all
the
country
did
hold
in
that
moment
and
i
went
all
that
day
at
a
strong
pace
and
did
be
oft
tempted
to
send
the
masterword
unto
naani
yet
did
keep
from
so
foolish
an
acting
the
which
mayhaps
had
brought
straightway
upon
me
an
evil
power
and
had
given
me
to
destruction
when
that
i
was
near
come
to
the
succour
of
the
maid
and
it
was
this
quick
and
constant
fear
of
the
evil
forces
of
the
night
land
that
did
keep
me
ever
from
calling
unto
naani
lest
that
they
should
discover
me
and
follow
after
and
this
i
doubt
not
you
to
know
by
now
so
well
as
i
now
by
the
sixth
hour
i
was
come
into
a
part
of
the
country
where
there
were
an
exceeding
abundance
of
steam
fountains
and
sprayings
and
great
upboilings
of
water
in
basins
of
rock
and
the
air
did
be
full
of
the
sounds
and
the
roarings
of
the
boilings
and
the
spoutings
and
of
a
hot
mist
and
spray
so
that
truly
i
had
scarce
the
power
to
see
to
my
front
nor
to
any
side
and
here
presently
i
made
a
pause
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
afterward
went
forward
again
and
i
did
keep
the
shore
of
the
sea
always
to
my
right
and
so
did
go
proper
to
my
way
yet
with
no
great
ease
for
the
sea
also
did
steam
very
strong
in
that
part
and
because
of
this
great
fog
of
steam
i
was
surely
much
laboured
to
make
a
great
speed
lest
unseeing
i
go
headlong
into
an
hole
of
the
boiling
water
and
in
the
ninth
hour
i
did
go
clear
of
the
hot
boilings
and
was
come
again
free
of
the
mist
and
the
steam
and
might
look
with
mine
eyes
to
my
going
and
surely
as
i
did
perceive
i
was
come
to
the
end
of
the
great
sea
that
had
been
ever
to
my
right
for
it
did
go
against
the
feet
of
great
and
monstrous
mountains
that
went
upward
for
ever
into
the
night
and
did
seem
as
that
they
were
the
hither
wall
of
that
strange
country
of
fire
and
water
and
so
was
i
stood
there
very
much
taken
upon
doubt
for
how
should
i
go
farther
and
after
that
i
had
been
there
a
while
in
a
bewilderment
of
doubt
and
of
wit
i
went
to
the
left
along
the
feet
of
the
mountains
and
truly
this
but
of
common
sense
for
how
might
i
go
any
other
way
save
i
go
back
again
and
at
the
twelfth
hour
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
went
forward
once
more
and
lo
at
the
fifteenth
hour
i
was
come
to
a
place
between
the
mountains
even
an
upward
gorge
very
dark
and
gloomy
and
without
light
for
a
great
way
and
in
verity
i
did
not
want
to
go
up
the
gorge
in
that
it
was
so
dreary
a
place
and
narrow
and
horrid
and
drearseeming
after
the
light
and
wideness
of
the
country
in
which
i
did
yet
stand
and
presently
i
did
go
past
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
that
i
should
learn
whether
there
went
another
way
out
of
that
country
and
thiswise
for
a
great
hour
more
along
the
feet
of
the
mountains
and
did
presently
come
to
a
monstrous
black
river
that
was
maybe
a
mile
wide
and
it
to
be
very
shallow
and
seeming
as
that
the
water
scarce
to
cover
the
mud
of
the
bottom
and
here
and
there
a
great
steam
did
come
from
it
and
spirtings
and
moundingsup
of
the
mud
in
many
places
and
monstrous
babblings
and
puffingsup
of
strange
smoke
as
that
a
great
heat
went
beneath
it
in
this
place
and
in
that
and
surely
it
went
backward
into
the
country
for
a
mighty
way
so
far
as
my
sight
did
go
and
i
did
think
it
to
be
no
river
but
truly
a
further
sea
and
there
was
no
way
across
for
there
were
no
trees
anigh
to
make
me
a
raft
neither
might
i
wade
across
for
it
might
be
shallow
here
and
deep
there
and
the
mud
be
in
all
places
and
moreover
i
had
been
like
to
be
caught
in
one
of
those
upburstings
of
mud
even
did
i
have
a
raft
to
go
upon
and
because
of
all
these
things
i
gat
me
back
again
to
the
gorge
and
presently
i
did
go
upward
into
the
darkness
now
i
went
upward
very
steady
save
that
i
did
stumble
oft
and
did
go
through
six
great
hours
and
truly
it
did
seem
that
i
went
in
an
utter
dark
because
that
i
had
been
awhile
in
so
constant
a
light
and
by
that
i
had
been
six
hours
in
the
gorge
i
was
gone
right
away
from
the
country
of
the
seas
and
did
be
as
that
i
was
back
into
some
place
that
was
like
to
the
dreadness
of
the
night
land
for
there
were
in
this
place
and
in
that
place
of
the
gorge
red
fireholes
even
as
in
the
night
land
yet
not
many
until
that
i
was
come
a
great
way
up
of
the
gorge
and
there
did
be
life
of
horrid
things
about
the
fires
as
soon
i
did
wot
so
that
i
made
to
keep
off
from
them
yet
as
you
shall
perceive
i
must
come
oft
pretty
near
because
that
the
gorge
was
nowheres
scarce
an
hundred
good
paces
across
and
did
oft
come
very
narrow
so
that
i
did
come
oft
anigh
to
the
fireholes
whether
that
i
did
heed
to
or
not
and
all
that
time
and
ever
did
the
gorge
go
very
sharp
upward
so
that
it
was
a
very
weary
thing
to
make
great
trial
of
speed
as
you
shall
know
but
yet
i
went
so
fast
as
i
could
do
for
i
was
grown
sudden
very
excited
about
the
heart
and
to
feel
as
that
i
did
surely
draw
anigh
to
that
strange
and
hid
place
of
the
world
where
was
the
lesser
refuge
and
when
i
had
gone
upward
through
six
great
hours
as
i
did
say
i
took
caution
for
a
place
proper
to
slumber
for
i
was
surely
very
wearied
and
i
saw
a
place
presently
afar
upward
of
the
dark
side
of
the
gorge
upon
the
right
where
a
ledge
of
the
rock
did
show
in
the
glaring
from
one
of
the
fireholes
that
made
a
gloomy
light
in
that
place
and
i
climbed
unto
this
ledge
and
did
find
it
to
be
secure
and
awkward
to
come
upon
and
presently
after
that
i
had
eat
and
drunk
i
did
compose
myself
unto
sleep
the
which
came
very
speedy
upon
me
whilst
yet
i
did
believe
i
thought
only
upon
the
sweetness
of
the
maid
and
truly
it
had
been
something
over
three
and
twenty
hours
since
last
i
did
sleep
so
that
i
was
greatly
awearied
and
in
six
hours
i
waked
and
did
eat
and
did
climb
downward
again
to
the
gorge
and
so
unto
mine
upward
journey
now
as
you
do
perceive
when
that
i
was
come
properly
a
great
way
up
the
gorge
and
had
come
among
the
fireholes
there
was
no
more
an
utter
darkness
for
the
dull
red
glare
of
the
pits
beat
upward
upon
the
black
sides
of
the
rockmountains
that
did
make
the
sides
of
the
gorge
so
that
oft
i
did
see
both
sides
very
plain
in
the
lower
parts
yet
of
the
height
of
the
gorge
who
might
know
aught
for
the
black
sides
did
go
upward
for
ever
into
the
everlasting
night
and
because
of
the
light
from
the
firepits
i
did
see
time
and
oft
about
the
fires
horrid
monsters
both
that
were
snakes
and
others
like
to
scorpions
so
great
as
my
head
but
no
more
than
these
for
a
long
while
and
afterward
i
perceived
that
surely
other
matters
did
move
among
the
rocks
of
the
gorge
so
that
i
did
keep
the
diskos
very
ready
in
mine
hand
yet
had
truly
no
use
for
it
all
that
day
now
i
eat
and
drank
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
and
went
onward
at
a
very
strong
speed
and
at
the
sixteenth
hour
i
did
seem
as
that
i
knew
the
aether
to
be
stirred
about
me
and
the
beat
of
the
masterword
very
faint
upon
mine
inward
ear
and
immediately
a
wondrous
great
and
lovely
thrilling
did
wake
all
my
being
for
surely
i
said
this
was
the
spirit
of
my
love
calling
unto
me
with
her
brainelements
and
indeed
this
was
a
very
proper
and
sensible
thinking
for
had
the
masterword
been
sent
from
the
mighty
pyramid
i
had
been
like
to
hear
it
very
plain
by
reason
of
the
force
of
the
earthcurrent
which
was
with
them
and
to
their
command
but
as
you
do
know
the
earthcurrent
was
nigh
gone
from
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
refuge
so
that
they
were
overweak
to
make
any
proper
calling
and
this
i
have
spoken
of
before
this
place
yet
in
a
little
while
as
i
did
stand
very
hushed
that
i
should
hark
the
better
i
was
come
to
doubt
whether
that
i
did
truly
hear
the
masterword
and
one
moment
i
did
say
that
it
had
surely
beat
in
the
night
about
me
and
immediately
would
i
be
just
so
unsure
and
so
in
a
while
i
gat
once
more
to
my
journey
and
had
doubt
in
my
heart
yet
as
you
shall
conceive
more
of
hope
and
because
of
this
thing
i
went
onward
for
thirty
great
hours
from
the
time
that
i
did
wake
for
my
heart
was
excited
within
me
and
when
that
i
had
gone
so
long
forward
as
this
i
did
see
how
that
i
did
foolishly
and
i
lookt
about
for
a
place
for
my
slumber
and
i
found
a
small
cave
that
was
clean
and
empty
as
i
did
discover
by
the
shining
of
the
diskos
which
i
made
to
spin
a
little
time
and
the
cave
was
in
the
cliff
of
the
mountain
that
made
the
right
side
of
the
gorge
and
was
nigh
twenty
good
feet
from
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
hard
to
approach
and
when
i
was
come
secure
into
the
cave
and
sure
that
it
was
proper
to
my
purpose
i
eat
four
of
the
tablets
as
was
just
and
nice
to
my
belly
and
did
afterward
drink
some
of
the
water
and
so
to
my
slumber
and
all
the
while
very
sweet
and
strong
in
my
thoughts
upon
naani
so
that
surely
i
was
a
little
time
before
that
i
had
myself
rightly
unto
sleep
and
i
slept
six
hours
and
did
wake
for
i
had
set
my
spirit
hard
unto
such
wakening
yet
was
i
still
greatly
yearning
for
sleep
but
this
did
go
somewhat
when
that
i
had
fought
a
little
with
my
need
and
afterward
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
did
gat
my
gear
upon
me
and
was
presently
down
unto
the
gorge
and
so
again
to
my
journey
now
in
all
that
day
i
did
go
with
a
very
stern
speed
for
it
did
seem
as
that
my
soul
did
know
for
surety
that
i
was
truly
come
something
nigh
unto
that
hid
place
in
the
night
where
i
should
find
mine
olden
love
again
and
the
sweet
hope
that
was
bred
of
the
calling
that
had
seemed
truly
to
sound
about
my
spirit
was
in
all
my
being
and
more
sure
on
that
day
than
before
that
i
had
slept
and
i
went
thirty
hours
in
all
even
as
before
ere
that
i
did
come
again
to
sleep
and
i
eat
and
drank
at
every
sixth
hour
so
that
my
strength
should
abide
within
me
and
by
that
i
was
come
to
the
ending
of
the
thirty
hours
i
was
sorely
awearied
and
gat
me
upward
of
the
monstrous
cliff
that
did
make
the
left
side
of
the
gorge
having
perceived
in
a
place
a
great
ledge
of
the
rock
that
did
seem
very
proper
for
my
purpose
of
slumber
and
when
i
was
come
upward
upon
the
ledge
of
the
rock
i
saw
that
there
did
seem
something
like
to
a
mighty
spider
that
did
stay
half
without
of
a
hole
in
the
back
part
of
the
ledge
and
i
smote
the
thing
gently
with
the
diskos
so
that
it
was
very
quickly
dead
and
afterward
i
searched
well
about
but
did
gladly
perceive
that
there
abode
there
no
other
horrid
creature
and
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
did
afterward
make
me
ready
for
slumber
as
ever
but
now
i
did
put
the
cloak
well
about
me
for
truly
there
was
grown
a
chill
into
the
air
of
the
gorge
and
here
also
will
i
tell
how
that
it
did
seem
unto
me
that
the
air
was
gone
something
from
that
great
thickness
and
strength
which
had
been
with
me
in
the
past
days
of
my
journeying
now
i
was
gone
so
tired
that
i
fell
upon
sleep
in
a
moment
yet
with
a
dear
thought
and
anxious
concerning
naani
but
was
so
starved
of
the
body
for
slumber
that
even
mine
anxiousness
kept
me
not
awake
and
i
was
then
so
fast
with
sleep
that
i
knew
naught
for
eight
hours
of
very
sound
slumber
and
then
did
i
awake
and
very
thankful
of
the
heart
that
no
evil
beast
or
creeping
thing
had
come
upon
me
whilst
that
i
was
so
utter
lost
in
sleep
and
now
truly
was
i
something
fresh
and
ready
and
i
ate
and
drank
and
had
my
gear
once
more
upon
me
and
so
down
into
the
gorge
and
afterward
i
went
upon
my
journey
for
eighteen
hours
and
did
pause
but
a
little
while
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
that
i
should
eat
and
drink
and
when
the
eighteenth
hour
was
nigh
come
i
perceived
that
the
nature
of
the
gorge
was
grown
very
horrid
and
dank
and
in
verity
i
did
feel
as
that
afar
upward
in
the
night
the
black
mountains
that
did
make
the
sides
of
the
gorge
had
come
together
and
did
make
a
monstrous
roof
unseen
in
the
utter
height
and
this
thing
i
do
tell
only
as
of
my
belief
for
i
have
no
very
sure
proof
yet
truly
my
reason
doth
say
likewise
for
there
did
oft
drip
water
upon
me
out
of
the
darkness
even
though
i
walked
in
the
middle
way
of
the
gorge
and
how
should
this
thing
be
save
that
there
went
an
overreaching
of
the
sides
that
should
let
the
mildew
down
upon
me
and
in
this
place
and
for
more
than
eleven
great
hours
there
were
fireholes
and
firepits
only
in
this
part
and
in
that
and
each
a
great
way
off
from
another
and
they
burned
very
dull
and
did
seem
to
throw
a
fume
of
sulphur
into
all
the
air
as
that
there
was
no
freedom
above
for
the
stink
to
pass
away
and
in
every
place
were
the
rocks
of
the
gorge
very
thick
and
slippery
with
strange
growths
so
that
it
was
a
sorrow
to
walk
upon
them
and
all
that
time
was
there
an
heavy
wetness
and
slowness
in
the
air
and
a
smell
beside
the
stink
of
the
firepits
as
that
i
did
go
forward
through
a
place
where
dead
things
did
be
and
for
a
great
time
there
was
a
horrid
darkness
as
it
had
been
that
the
air
was
grown
thick
with
the
fumings
of
the
firepits
as
i
do
believe
and
beside
this
thing
there
was
as
i
have
said
but
a
dull
fire
here
and
another
there
so
that
it
was
like
that
there
should
be
a
heavy
dark
and
because
that
it
was
so
utter
black
and
because
that
there
were
growths
upon
the
rocks
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
i
did
go
but
slowly
and
with
pain
of
stumblings
and
always
with
the
stink
of
that
place
to
trouble
me
half
unto
a
sickness
and
sudden
as
i
did
go
past
one
of
the
firepits
i
saw
that
the
fire
made
a
dull
shining
upon
some
monstrous
thing
that
did
move
before
me
upon
the
far
side
of
the
fire
and
i
came
in
one
moment
unto
a
swift
silence
and
hid
among
the
rocks
of
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
i
lookt
very
cautious
at
the
thing
that
moved
beyond
the
fire
and
surely
i
had
seen
no
thing
so
monstrous
since
that
i
had
come
free
of
the
night
land
for
it
was
as
that
some
huge
creature
like
to
the
hull
of
a
great
ship
did
move
down
out
of
the
dark
of
the
upper
way
of
the
gorge
and
it
went
by
the
firehole
and
onward
into
the
dark
of
the
lower
way
of
the
gorge
and
i
had
perceived
somewhat
of
it
as
it
did
go
past
the
fire
and
surely
it
was
black
and
beslimed
and
utter
great
in
height
and
in
length
and
it
went
always
without
noise
so
that
i
had
not
known
it
to
be
there
but
that
i
saw
it
plain
with
mine
eyes
and
truly
if
i
do
say
that
it
was
somewhat
as
that
i
had
seen
a
monstrous
slugthing
surely
i
should
use
wise
and
proper
words
to
make
known
to
you
this
horrid
brute
and
i
stayed
very
quiet
a
time
and
afterward
i
went
upward
again
of
the
gorge
and
did
use
a
new
caution
to
my
way
and
saw
that
the
diskos
was
free
upon
my
hip
for
even
thus
i
did
carry
the
weapon
being
that
i
must
use
both
hands
to
my
way
and
to
save
me
in
my
stumblings
and
slidings
over
the
slippery
rocks
and
once
it
did
seem
to
me
that
some
great
thing
moved
in
the
darkness
and
i
went
downward
among
the
rocks
and
stirred
not
my
body
for
a
great
while
and
sure
am
i
that
there
went
some
living
monster
past
me
that
did
stink
as
a
loathsome
grave
and
afterward
i
went
on
again
and
three
hours
did
i
go
thus
and
came
at
last
to
a
place
where
a
firehole
did
shine
more
ruddy
and
i
did
look
well
about
me
that
i
should
perceive
that
part
of
the
gorge
the
better
and
as
i
stood
there
very
quiet
away
off
from
the
fire
so
that
it
did
show
no
great
light
upon
my
person
i
did
note
how
utter
still
was
that
place
and
this
to
take
me
anew
as
though
it
had
come
fresh
upon
me
and
here
there
would
be
the
drip
of
water
and
again
in
that
place
and
again
elsewhere
and
all
very
solemn
and
very
dismal
and
the
silence
to
be
constant
and
presently
as
i
lookt
now
to
this
way
and
again
to
that
i
saw
that
there
was
a
monstrous
slugthing
laid
upward
against
the
black
side
of
the
gorge
as
that
it
had
stood
up
on
end
and
the
one
end
of
the
monster
went
upward
beyond
the
light
from
the
firepit
but
the
other
part
did
come
down
and
trail
into
the
gorge
as
a
long
hillock
very
ugly
and
black
and
beslimed
and
i
near
sweat
with
a
disgust
and
horror
of
the
thing
but
afterward
i
had
more
courage
and
spied
well
upon
the
brute
and
surely
it
moved
not
at
all
any
more
than
the
side
of
the
cliff
of
the
gorge
and
i
conceived
that
it
stood
not
upward
upon
any
feet
but
clung
to
the
rock
even
as
you
shall
see
a
slug
to
go
and
for
a
great
space
i
was
very
quiet
and
moved
not
neither
did
i
make
to
hide
but
stood
there
very
stupid
yet
in
a
time
i
had
more
of
courage
which
brought
strength
unto
my
heart
and
i
began
again
to
go
upon
my
way
but
with
an
utter
caution
and
i
then
to
creep
for
a
weary
time
upon
my
hands
and
knees
among
the
dank
and
weariful
rocks
and
boulders
that
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
thrice
between
four
hours
was
i
passed
by
hidden
and
monstrous
things
in
the
horrid
dark
places
of
the
gorge
yet
with
no
noise
save
as
it
might
be
the
odd
rattle
of
a
rock
in
this
place
and
that
but
with
an
utter
and
dreadful
stinking
and
i
to
be
quiet
as
they
went
as
you
shall
think
and
each
time
now
that
i
did
go
by
the
firepits
and
fireholes
that
lay
oddways
in
the
gorge
i
did
pause
and
search
about
me
with
mine
eyes
very
cautious
and
oft
now
did
i
perceive
how
that
the
monstrous
slug
creatures
did
lie
in
this
place
and
in
that
against
the
cliffs
of
the
gorge
and
i
did
go
then
utter
still
from
this
space
to
that
space
among
the
rocks
and
oft
upon
the
flat
of
my
belly
and
with
a
constant
heed
that
i
make
not
mine
armour
to
knock
against
the
boulders
and
always
as
i
did
go
there
was
a
monstrous
stench
and
the
choking
of
sulphurous
smoke
very
oft
and
here
and
there
as
mine
heart
doth
believe
there
were
utter
great
caverns
within
the
mountains
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
of
this
thing
i
have
some
small
proof
for
once
i
did
go
by
a
place
where
a
fire
did
burn
as
it
should
be
a
firehole
afar
inward
of
the
mountain
side
upon
my
right
so
that
i
saw
in
a
moment
that
i
looked
in
the
darkness
through
the
mouth
of
a
mighty
caveplace
and
i
went
past
very
quick
and
silent
for
i
knew
not
whether
any
horrid
thing
should
come
forth
out
of
that
place
to
slay
me
and
truly
as
i
did
think
if
there
did
be
one
such
place
there
were
like
to
be
many
and
mayhaps
the
slugs
came
forth
from
those
caverns
where
as
i
did
conceive
there
was
naught
save
an
eternal
dripping
of
waters
and
the
foul
growth
of
things
in
all
parts
yet
is
this
last
but
a
thought
as
i
do
say
and
you
shall
wisely
take
it
for
no
more
than
that
now
i
came
clear
of
the
darkness
and
the
slime
and
the
stinking
in
about
twelve
hours
after
the
time
that
i
did
think
the
mountains
to
be
a
roof
unto
the
gorge
and
the
air
was
now
free
and
did
seem
as
that
some
life
and
health
did
abound
in
it
and
the
fires
did
be
more
plentiful
and
burned
very
bright
and
clean
and
threw
all
their
fumings
upward
so
that
there
was
no
more
any
bitter
pain
of
sulphur
within
my
throat
and
surely
it
was
with
a
thankful
heart
that
i
went
onward
and
with
a
good
speed
for
there
was
much
of
light
all
about
me
in
that
there
burned
an
hundred
firepits
here
and
in
that
place
so
that
i
saw
clear
before
me
and
behind
and
conceived
that
the
slugs
did
abide
only
in
the
closed
part
of
the
gorge
and
oft
i
did
take
the
air
very
full
into
my
lungs
for
the
sweetness
of
it
after
the
horrid
stenchings
that
i
had
abode
all
those
hours
and
presently
when
i
was
come
free
of
the
roofed
part
of
the
gorge
maybe
some
three
good
hours
i
lookt
for
a
place
proper
to
slumber
for
it
was
surely
something
over
three
and
thirty
hours
since
that
i
did
last
come
upon
sleep
and
i
was
utter
worn
and
lost
of
strength
with
so
much
of
creeping
and
harking
for
monsters
as
you
shall
believe
moreover
about
that
time
i
had
gone
bitter
long
whiles
between
slumberings
through
more
than
an
hundred
hours
as
you
shall
have
perceived
from
my
tellings
now
presently
i
saw
a
small
cave
that
went
inward
of
the
side
of
the
gorge
and
i
lookt
into
the
cave
and
found
it
to
be
sweet
and
clean
and
very
dry
and
there
was
a
small
firepit
off
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
that
did
throw
a
good
light
for
my
purpose
so
that
i
saw
there
was
no
creeping
thing
or
horror
in
the
place
and
i
went
in
and
made
to
prepare
for
my
slumber
but
truly
when
i
was
come
to
look
upon
myself
i
was
utter
soiled
and
did
seem
as
that
i
stank
with
the
slime
and
disgust
of
the
dark
part
of
the
gorge
where
i
had
gone
upon
my
hands
and
upon
my
belly
and
because
of
this
i
was
set
that
i
should
not
eat
or
come
to
sleep
without
i
washed
me
and
i
went
out
from
the
cave
and
there
was
a
spring
near
to
the
firepit
as
was
oft
in
that
part
of
the
gorge
and
the
spring
was
hot
and
did
fill
a
hollow
of
the
rock
very
quiet
and
with
a
fuming
of
sulphur
as
i
did
bend
above
it
and
i
washed
mine
hands
and
face
and
mine
armour
and
gear
in
the
hot
spring
and
did
dry
me
with
my
pocketcloth
and
so
was
sweetened
and
put
to
happiness
of
mind
and
i
went
back
into
the
cave
and
did
sit
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
with
the
diskos
to
mine
hand
and
i
eat
four
of
the
tablets
for
i
was
gone
a
mortal
long
while
without
and
afterward
i
drank
some
of
the
water
and
as
i
did
eat
and
drink
i
lookt
out
upon
the
lightness
of
the
gorge
before
me
and
with
a
cheerful
and
composed
heart
and
i
saw
presently
that
there
came
certain
creatures
out
from
their
holes
even
as
it
might
be
that
they
were
part
rats
but
very
strange
looking
and
not
properly
such
and
some
did
lie
about
the
firehole
and
some
did
hunt
about
in
the
rocks
and
one
came
presently
and
had
a
snake
by
the
neck
and
it
stood
upon
the
snake
and
did
eat
it
even
while
that
the
snake
did
lash
about
upon
the
rock
and
the
snake
did
lash
until
that
it
was
nigh
all
eat
and
a
very
strange
thing
this
was
to
see
and
something
troublesome
to
the
pity
yet
was
i
glad
to
perceive
that
there
were
enemies
to
the
serpents
of
that
place
and
when
the
rat
creature
did
make
an
end
of
the
snake
it
made
across
to
the
spring
and
did
drink
the
hot
water
a
while
and
afterward
back
unto
the
fire
and
there
laid
down
anigh
to
the
edge
and
seeming
very
sweetly
comforted
of
the
belly
which
in
truth
was
much
otherwise
with
me
and
after
that
i
saw
many
creatures
that
went
about
the
fire
and
did
have
warmth
from
the
fire
and
drink
from
the
spring
and
surely
i
did
ponder
that
the
peoples
of
this
our
age
should
say
if
they
had
stood
with
me
that
providence
had
made
nigh
together
the
warmth
and
the
drink
that
were
needful
unto
life
for
it
was
grown
to
a
bitter
chill
now
in
the
gorge
but
rather
did
this
thing
seem
to
me
otherwise
that
these
creatures
did
be
but
of
their
circumstance
and
if
that
it
had
been
another
way
then
had
they
grown
of
their
wits
to
meet
it
to
their
means
of
life
yet
as
some
would
say
the
arguments
do
but
meet
and
be
the
same
thing
and
neither
way
do
i
care
in
this
place
but
do
no
more
than
to
show
unto
you
the
working
of
my
brain
in
this
way
and
that
as
i
made
my
journey
now
presently
when
i
was
done
eating
and
come
very
ready
to
fall
upon
sleep
i
went
out
from
the
cave
and
gat
me
certain
boulders
the
which
i
did
carry
into
the
cave
and
when
i
was
come
back
for
the
last
time
i
put
them
very
secure
in
the
entranceway
that
no
small
stinging
creature
come
at
me
as
i
slept
and
after
that
i
made
ready
and
went
to
my
sleep
having
sweet
thoughts
and
slumbrous
of
the
maid
now
i
slept
very
quiet
that
time
and
was
not
over
troubled
with
the
chill
of
the
gorge
which
was
but
little
in
that
place
both
by
reason
of
the
firepit
and
because
that
the
cave
did
help
to
keep
my
warmth
to
me
and
i
had
a
deep
slumber
for
eight
hours
and
waked
then
pretty
tired
but
strong
to
go
upon
my
way
and
after
that
i
had
sat
a
little
while
i
came
full
to
wakefulness
and
afterward
did
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drink
some
of
the
water
the
which
i
did
sitting
in
the
mouthpart
of
the
cave
after
that
i
had
cast
free
the
boulders
and
afterward
i
gat
my
gear
upon
me
and
i
went
again
upon
my
journey
and
the
gorge
did
continue
very
light
and
cheerful
with
the
shining
of
the
fires
and
oft
there
did
be
a
little
steam
that
did
hiss
from
this
part
or
that
of
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
did
blow
very
quaint
and
noisy
in
the
quiet
of
that
place
and
oft
there
did
be
hot
pools
and
everywhere
the
great
boulders
in
the
bottom
way
and
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
black
and
mighty
sides
of
the
gorge
that
did
go
upward
for
ever
into
the
everlasting
night
and
so
i
did
go
and
had
eat
and
drunk
at
the
sixth
hour
and
gone
onward
again
and
lo
at
the
eighth
hour
i
did
thrill
sudden
with
a
wondrous
great
thrilling
for
in
verity
it
did
seem
to
me
that
the
masterword
did
beat
softly
about
me
out
of
all
the
night
of
the
world
and
all
my
heart
did
throb
with
great
glowings
of
joy
yet
was
the
beat
of
the
word
unsure
so
that
i
knew
not
truly
whether
my
spirit
had
indeed
heard
aught
for
there
was
immediately
a
silence
as
ever
about
mine
inward
being
yet
as
you
shall
believe
there
was
a
new
hope
and
strength
of
courage
in
all
my
body
and
soul
and
i
went
forward
very
swift
and
all
renewed
as
it
were
and
my
strength
and
hope
did
make
naught
of
any
terror
that
should
lie
to
bar
my
way
neither
did
i
have
further
heed
of
the
boulders
that
lay
always
upon
my
path
but
did
go
over
them
with
quick
leapings
and
a
wondrous
and
thrilling
eagerness
of
the
heart
within
me
and
sudden
in
the
end
of
the
tenth
hour
i
perceived
that
the
mighty
walls
of
blackness
that
made
the
sides
of
the
gorge
did
be
no
more
there
and
that
i
was
come
truly
upon
the
end
of
the
gorge
and
i
near
trembled
with
hope
and
astonishment
for
when
i
was
gone
a
little
way
on
i
had
ceased
to
go
upward
any
more
and
was
come
clear
out
from
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
and
did
peer
forth
across
a
mighty
country
of
night
and
it
did
seem
to
me
as
that
i
was
come
to
a
second
land
of
strange
matters
even
as
the
night
land
where
did
lie
the
wonder
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
surely
i
did
think
within
my
heart
that
i
was
come
at
last
to
that
far
and
hidden
place
of
the
world
where
did
be
the
lesser
redoubt
but
yet
was
there
no
place
in
all
that
night
where
did
tower
the
shining
lights
of
the
lesser
pyramid
the
which
i
did
hope
vainly
to
perceive
and
because
that
i
saw
them
not
a
great
heaviness
came
upon
my
spirits
for
a
time
but
afterward
the
heaviness
did
go
for
i
put
reason
to
help
my
courage
and
did
plan
this
cause
and
that
to
show
why
that
i
was
not
come
to
sight
of
the
shining
embrasures
of
the
lesser
redoubt
but
yet
was
there
left
an
ache
of
doubting
as
you
shall
well
conceive
now
this
land
was
very
new
and
strange
and
had
a
great
light
in
this
part
and
a
wondrous
grim
darkness
in
that
and
i
did
pause
a
great
while
to
determine
how
that
i
should
go
properly
and
presently
i
bethought
me
of
the
compass
and
did
draw
it
forth
and
set
it
upon
the
earth
that
i
should
see
how
it
did
act
and
truly
it
did
go
almost
as
naani
had
told
to
me
so
that
i
was
very
sure
in
all
my
being
that
i
was
in
verity
come
anigh
to
the
hidden
refuge
but
yet
did
the
compass
give
me
no
proper
guiding
to
my
way
so
that
i
was
no
more
wise
to
this
end
than
before
only
that
i
had
the
comfort
of
that
which
it
did
seem
to
assure
and
in
a
little
while
i
went
forward
into
the
land
and
did
hope
that
i
should
come
presently
to
some
matter
to
help
my
choice
and
i
went
first
toward
a
certain
great
glowing
of
fire
that
lay
before
me
and
did
seem
joined
to
another
great
glare
that
went
afar
to
my
left
and
i
found
the
ground
of
that
land
to
be
very
fair
for
my
feet
and
to
have
in
this
place
and
that
certain
bushes
even
as
it
did
seem
to
me
of
the
kind
that
we
named
mossbushes
in
the
night
land
as
you
do
know
and
i
made
a
very
good
speed
and
went
thus
until
i
had
gone
for
maybe
six
long
hours
and
by
that
time
i
was
come
anigh
to
the
glowing
of
light
and
did
keep
now
a
strong
caution
to
my
going
for
truly
as
i
did
know
from
the
tellings
of
the
maid
there
were
very
horrid
and
dreadful
powers
in
that
land
and
i
did
well
to
remember
that
i
was
come
again
to
parts
where
might
be
the
destruction
of
the
spirit
now
i
made
a
pause
and
lookt
toward
the
glowing
light
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
a
monstrous
way
unto
the
right
and
unto
the
left
there
did
be
surely
a
great
hid
valley
in
the
earth
before
me
for
the
shining
did
seem
as
that
it
came
up
from
out
of
a
valley
as
that
there
burned
a
deep
light
in
such
a
place
but
yet
was
i
all
unsure
and
had
no
proper
knowing
whether
indeed
there
did
be
any
valley
there
but
only
a
strange
and
luminous
shining
that
did
come
upward
from
the
earth
and
i
made
no
great
haste
now
to
go
unto
that
place
but
went
down
sudden
into
the
bushes
and
lay
upon
my
belly
and
had
a
new
great
fear
upon
my
spirit
and
presently
i
parted
the
bushes
a
little
and
made
a
place
for
spying
and
i
looked
a
great
time
unto
the
place
of
the
light
and
now
to
this
part
and
now
to
that
and
sudden
i
saw
as
it
did
seem
a
monstrous
head
within
the
glowing
for
the
glowing
did
seem
at
whiles
as
that
it
swept
to
and
fore
as
should
a
shining
smoke
that
went
obedient
to
a
quiet
wind
and
so
to
hide
and
again
to
uncover
and
in
a
moment
i
lost
the
great
face
and
was
all
unsure
that
ever
i
had
seen
aught
and
lo
in
a
little
minute
i
did
see
it
again
but
whether
it
did
be
the
shape
of
some
utter
monster
of
eternityeven
as
the
watchers
about
the
mighty
pyramidor
whether
it
did
be
no
more
than
a
carven
mountain
of
rock
shaped
unto
the
dire
picturing
of
a
monster
i
did
have
no
knowing
but
i
made
that
i
should
get
hence
very
quick
and
i
did
turn
me
about
in
the
bushes
and
went
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
so
came
at
last
a
great
way
off
now
presently
i
came
again
upon
my
feet
and
did
take
a
new
look
around
that
land
and
i
had
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
to
my
back
and
this
i
perceived
by
the
shining
of
the
firepits
that
made
the
place
shown
to
me
and
to
the
left
of
the
gorge
was
an
utter
blackness
as
i
did
conceive
of
black
and
monstrous
mountains
through
which
the
gorge
did
come
and
to
the
right
side
of
the
gorge
there
were
many
low
volcanoes
that
went
always
along
the
feet
of
the
great
mountains
that
made
the
right
wall
of
the
gorge
and
i
saw
the
feet
of
these
dark
mountains
because
that
the
light
from
the
little
volcanoes
made
a
glare
upon
the
lower
slopes
and
so
shall
you
have
some
knowing
of
that
part
of
this
second
land
of
night
and
a
good
way
off
was
the
shining
that
i
had
journeyed
unto
and
the
shining
went
into
a
distant
light
through
a
part
of
the
land
that
lay
afar
to
my
left
for
it
stretched
a
great
and
strange
way
toward
me
out
of
the
leftward
gloom
and
came
unto
my
front
and
so
away
into
an
utter
distance
yet
though
it
was
so
great
you
shall
not
think
that
it
made
any
huge
light
in
the
land
but
was
rather
as
that
it
had
a
shining
made
unto
other
ends
for
it
made
not
a
great
lightness
in
the
land
and
you
do
now
perceive
something
roughly
how
the
land
did
seem
to
my
back
part
and
unto
my
left
and
somewhat
before
my
face
and
because
that
i
did
think
to
have
no
profit
to
my
search
if
that
i
went
to
the
left
i
made
attention
unto
the
right
and
here
there
was
much
of
darkness
yet
oft
the
shining
of
fireholes
in
this
place
and
that
amid
the
darkness
and
as
i
did
look
it
grew
very
plain
upon
me
how
great
was
the
spread
and
drear
wideness
of
that
country
of
night
and
how
that
i
did
be
an
utter
lonesome
person
in
all
that
dark
and
so
shall
you
be
with
me
in
sympathy
of
the
utter
greatness
of
my
task
and
know
of
the
fear
that
did
breed
odd
whiles
that
i
should
search
until
i
die
and
never
find
and
you
to
give
me
good
human
understanding
now
i
made
no
more
to
delay
but
went
unto
the
right
and
did
keep
the
chain
of
the
little
volcanoes
something
level
to
my
course
though
a
great
way
off
and
i
went
thus
with
a
strange
growing
of
hope
and
an
excitement
for
ten
hours
and
had
eat
not
then
for
more
than
twenty
hours
and
surely
not
since
the
sixth
hour
of
that
day
and
this
because
that
i
was
so
utter
shaken
from
my
calmness
of
going
and
at
the
tenth
hour
i
went
utter
weak
and
did
seem
surely
as
that
i
must
swoon
and
lo
i
bethought
me
how
that
i
was
gone
so
long
without
aught
for
my
belly
and
surely
when
i
was
quiet
a
time
i
eat
four
of
the
tablets
and
in
a
good
while
did
feel
all
renewed
and
would
rest
no
more
after
that
i
had
drunk
some
of
the
water
but
went
onward
for
in
verity
my
spirit
did
be
as
that
it
had
slain
me
if
that
i
had
lain
down
at
that
time
and
this
because
hope
was
so
fierce
in
me
for
i
to
feel
indeed
that
i
was
come
near
to
the
maid
and
i
went
ten
hours
more
until
that
i
did
truly
totter
upon
my
feet
with
utter
and
dreadful
weariness
for
i
had
gone
now
through
someways
of
forty
great
hours
and
had
been
foolish
in
mine
eating
and
drinking
as
you
have
perceived
but
yet
was
this
to
be
forgiven
for
i
was
as
that
i
should
come
any
little
minute
upon
the
wonder
of
the
lesser
pyramid
shining
afar
in
the
night
yet
truly
there
was
nowhere
anything
that
might
be
likened
unto
it
and
i
lay
down
there
just
as
i
did
be
and
with
no
proper
heed
to
my
safety
and
i
was
gone
asleep
in
one
moment
as
it
did
seem
and
waked
not
for
twelve
hours
and
then
did
come
suddenly
unto
knowledge
and
thankful
was
i
in
the
heart
that
no
monster
had
come
upon
me
in
that
deadtime
of
slumbering
and
i
eat
four
of
the
tablets
as
was
surely
due
unto
me
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
so
gat
forward
again
into
the
night
and
truly
i
was
mortal
stiff
and
did
ache
for
a
great
while
and
this
did
be
in
part
because
that
i
had
wrapped
not
the
cloak
about
me
ere
i
slept
for
the
land
was
bitter
cold
and
did
make
the
blood
very
chill
now
when
i
had
gone
onward
through
six
hours
i
ate
and
drank
for
i
did
mind
now
to
be
wise
and
keep
my
strength
good
within
me
and
i
went
onward
again
at
a
very
great
speed
and
full
of
an
excitement
and
surely
i
did
be
glad
at
last
that
the
tablets
were
so
easy
gone
in
the
mouth
and
unfilling
to
the
belly
for
i
had
been
without
power
and
patience
to
eat
proper
victual
and
at
the
tenth
hour
i
saw
that
there
rose
a
redshining
out
of
the
land
before
me
as
that
it
came
upward
from
a
mighty
pit
and
i
made
slow
my
way
and
so
when
i
was
gone
on
for
two
great
hours
more
i
saw
that
monstrous
figures
went
about
against
the
red
glare
of
the
shining
and
i
gat
me
down
into
the
bushes
which
were
very
plentiful
in
that
part
and
i
stayed
there
for
a
certain
while
and
made
a
watch
upon
the
redshining
and
the
figures
and
truly
it
did
seem
to
me
that
there
were
horrid
giants
in
that
land
even
as
in
the
night
land
and
afterward
i
crept
away
and
went
outward
from
the
little
volcanoes
into
that
part
of
the
land
that
was
dark
save
as
you
do
mind
for
the
glare
of
fireholes
in
this
part
and
that
and
i
went
now
with
an
utter
care
for
the
giants
had
put
a
new
caution
into
my
heart
and
i
did
surely
mean
that
i
should
live
to
rescue
mine
own
maid
and
have
joy
through
all
my
life
and
thereafter
i
went
with
the
diskos
in
my
hand
and
at
each
hour
that
was
the
sixth
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
so
did
keep
my
strength
very
good
within
me
now
presently
i
was
come
to
a
place
where
the
land
did
go
downward
a
great
slope
and
there
was
a
difference
in
the
earth
that
went
beneath
my
feet
and
no
great
plenty
of
the
bushes
but
only
one
in
this
place
and
one
in
that
and
nowhere
any
firehole
and
i
gat
me
down
and
did
feel
the
earth
with
my
hands
and
lo
i
did
find
presently
smooth
stones
and
afterward
olden
shells
and
immediately
a
great
delight
took
me
for
naani
had
told
how
that
the
lesser
pyramid
stood
something
nigh
to
the
shore
of
an
ancient
sea
that
was
long
dried
up
in
the
years
of
eternity
and
surely
it
might
be
that
i
was
come
down
into
the
dry
bottom
of
that
same
olden
sea
and
should
presently
have
sight
of
the
little
pyramid
and
because
that
hope
was
put
so
fresh
into
me
i
went
forward
through
maybe
thirty
hours
across
the
olden
seabed
but
in
all
that
time
i
had
no
sight
of
the
lights
of
the
lesser
redoubt
and
a
great
trouble
began
to
take
me
for
indeed
naani
had
not
told
me
how
great
was
the
sea
and
it
might
be
that
i
should
wander
a
weariful
age
across
it
before
that
i
come
to
the
far
side
and
it
did
come
to
me
presently
how
that
i
should
be
wise
to
see
that
my
way
was
very
straight
so
that
i
waste
not
my
strength
in
useless
wanderings
and
i
had
a
great
care
now
to
observe
that
the
redshining
did
be
always
upon
my
right
to
my
rear
and
by
this
reasonable
cunning
did
i
make
to
steer
very
nicely
through
the
great
gloom
of
that
place
now
as
i
did
go
across
the
bed
of
the
great
sea
i
heard
strange
sounds
now
in
this
part
of
the
darkness
and
now
in
that
and
oft
did
there
be
a
noise
as
if
things
did
run
this
way
and
that
way
in
the
bed
of
the
sea
and
once
afar
off
in
the
night
there
did
be
a
strange
and
horrid
screaming
so
that
i
did
know
truly
that
the
monsters
of
that
land
were
out
and
did
go
about
in
the
dark
and
as
you
shall
perceive
and
understand
i
was
all
unknowing
of
the
lore
of
that
land
so
that
i
knew
not
what
to
think
of
this
strange
sound
or
that
neither
knew
i
what
they
might
portend
but
only
that
as
i
did
say
there
were
monsters
abroad
and
i
could
do
no
more
than
have
my
way
forward
with
an
utter
care
always
and
be
very
ready
with
the
diskos
or
to
hide
each
as
maybe
according
to
the
need
and
surely
i
went
oneandforty
hours
that
day
and
eat
and
drank
after
every
sixth
hour
and
before
this
in
the
sevenandthirtieth
hour
i
heard
a
great
roaring
and
bellowing
in
the
night
coming
nigh
unto
me
and
afterward
the
thudding
of
monstrous
feet
as
that
a
giant
ran
past
me
in
the
darkness
and
did
make
a
chase
of
some
creature
and
the
thudding
of
the
feet
and
the
roaring
went
far
off
into
the
night
and
there
did
seem
presently
to
come
back
to
me
from
a
great
way
a
little
screaming
but
of
this
thing
i
had
no
surety
and
i
abode
very
hushed
in
a
clump
of
bush
until
quietness
was
come
again
all
about
for
there
had
been
an
utter
frightening
sound
in
the
horrid
voice
and
in
the
thudding
of
the
great
feet
now
in
the
oneandfortieth
hour
of
that
day
i
came
upon
the
farther
shore
of
the
olden
sea
but
lo
there
was
nowhere
any
light
to
tell
me
aught
of
the
lesser
refuge
and
truly
a
great
doubt
and
bewilderment
took
me
for
indeed
i
could
not
perceive
how
it
might
be
that
i
saw
not
the
lights
of
the
embrasures
of
the
lesser
pyramid
and
a
great
despair
took
me
so
that
i
sat
down
there
upon
the
shore
of
the
olden
sea
and
had
no
heed
of
anything
for
a
while
but
afterward
i
ate
and
drunk
and
went
into
a
clump
of
bush
and
wrapt
the
cloak
about
me
and
so
went
fast
unto
sleep
with
the
diskos
handy
to
my
breast
and
in
verity
the
pain
of
the
despair
and
the
bewilderment
of
mine
heart
did
make
rather
for
sleep
than
to
keep
me
wakeful
for
indeed
i
was
half
stunned
of
the
brain
and
of
my
courage
and
did
seem
now
the
farther
off
from
the
ending
of
my
search
than
ever
i
had
been
and
i
slept
six
hours
and
waked
then
sudden
and
i
leaned
up
upon
mine
elbow
in
the
bush
and
harked
very
quiet
perchance
some
noise
had
shaken
my
sleep
from
me
but
indeed
there
was
nothing
only
that
i
was
wakeful
and
did
mind
me
of
my
trouble
of
failure
yet
now
i
did
invent
this
thing
and
that
thing
to
make
natural
account
that
i
was
not
come
to
the
lesser
redoubt
and
so
had
hope
again
within
me
yet
much
also
of
doubt
and
bewilderment
and
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
again
to
my
journey
and
i
made
that
i
should
keep
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
the
which
i
did
through
twelve
hours
and
was
then
still
so
much
in
doubt
as
ever
and
i
ceased
from
my
journeying
and
lookt
about
me
over
the
land
and
lo
i
did
note
how
that
a
weak
and
strange
shining
was
in
the
air
of
the
land
at
a
great
way
as
it
had
been
that
a
far
spreaded
and
faint
glowing
made
a
little
glare
into
all
the
night
unto
my
left
and
before
me
now
i
ate
and
drank
and
made
to
steady
my
spirit
for
i
did
fear
lest
i
should
feel
utter
lost
in
all
the
night
of
the
world
and
to
know
not
where
to
make
any
more
my
search
and
so
to
grow
desperate
in
despair
and
this
thing
you
will
understand
and
afterward
i
did
make
across
that
land
unto
the
place
where
it
did
seem
that
the
dull
shining
was
something
bright
and
i
went
thus
through
eighteen
hours
and
did
make
pause
at
each
sixth
hour
and
ate
and
drank
very
resolute
though
in
verity
it
did
seem
as
that
even
so
small
a
matter
as
the
tablets
did
be
like
to
choke
me
and
by
this
is
it
plain
to
me
how
great
an
anguish
was
come
upon
my
spirit
lest
that
i
was
all
astray
and
should
have
no
joy
to
succour
mine
own
and
thrice
in
the
time
that
i
did
go
there
did
be
a
running
of
feet
amid
the
darkness
and
odd
whiles
strange
and
horrid
cryings
in
the
night
so
that
i
put
a
force
upon
my
despair
and
hid
me
for
indeed
i
had
no
right
to
lose
care
of
my
life
if
there
did
be
any
chance
yet
that
i
find
the
maid
and
lo
in
the
eighteenth
hour
which
was
truly
the
thirtieth
of
that
day
i
found
the
shining
in
the
night
to
be
grown
very
plain
and
an
utter
stinking
of
sulphur
and
truly
i
did
be
aware
that
the
land
went
upward
and
i
made
upward
through
seven
hours
and
the
light
did
grow
more
plain
and
was
of
a
dull
redness
very
sombre
and
heavy
and
in
the
end
of
six
more
hours
i
ceased
to
go
upward
and
did
know
of
a
strange
low
sound
that
did
be
like
to
no
other
sound
that
ever
i
did
hear
and
was
like
to
a
dull
roar
that
did
never
have
ceased
through
eternity
and
i
went
forward
unto
the
light
and
the
land
to
be
now
as
that
i
went
over
an
upland
plain
and
i
did
go
thus
through
five
hours
and
the
low
roar
did
grow
ever
upon
mine
ears
and
truly
even
as
i
did
shape
my
thoughts
to
take
a
caution
for
my
body
i
went
upward
again
a
little
and
came
out
upon
the
edge
of
a
mighty
cliff
and
the
low
and
constant
roar
did
moan
upward
against
me
with
an
everlasting
muttering
and
i
lookt
downward
a
monstrous
way
and
surely
there
was
spread
out
a
mighty
sea
as
it
did
seem
of
dull
fire
as
that
a
redhot
mud
did
lap
very
deep
and
quiet
below
me
in
all
that
night
and
i
lookt
outward
across
the
strange
sea
and
the
far
side
was
hid
from
me
for
surely
there
were
dull
and
solemn
clouds
that
came
off
the
sea
and
hid
the
distance
from
me
and
the
clouds
to
glow
a
little
redly
and
so
to
rise
and
presently
to
blacken
into
the
night
and
i
lookt
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
it
was
plain
that
the
black
cliffs
did
stretch
out
both
ways
and
did
go
downward
ever
into
that
monstrous
sea
of
slow
fire
and
there
were
great
headlands
that
went
out
into
the
fire
as
into
a
sea
and
the
fire
did
lap
very
quiet
about
these
and
where
the
fire
lapt
about
them
there
did
shine
and
spirt
out
green
flames
and
vapours
at
diverse
times
and
indeed
as
i
did
perceive
i
was
come
to
an
upward
sea
of
fire
as
it
were
the
deep
inwards
of
a
low
and
utter
monstrous
volcano
that
was
flat
of
the
top
and
utter
big
across
and
in
verity
i
did
look
downward
into
the
fires
of
the
inward
earth
and
a
very
wondrous
sight
was
it
to
stand
there
alone
upon
the
cliffs
of
that
everlasting
sea
and
a
great
heat
came
upward
from
the
dull
and
grim
fire
of
that
gloomy
sea
and
a
reek
of
sulphur
so
that
i
was
like
to
be
choked
and
did
go
backward
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
surely
i
was
come
to
the
end
of
that
dark
land
upon
that
side
and
had
nowhere
perceived
the
lesser
pyramid
in
all
the
night
of
my
travel
and
a
new
despair
came
upon
me
for
indeed
it
seemed
i
was
come
all
astray
in
the
night
of
the
world
and
did
nowise
have
any
knowing
whether
i
stood
near
to
the
country
of
the
lesser
redoubt
or
whether
that
i
was
gone
half
across
the
world
unto
a
strange
place
and
then
as
the
despair
troubled
my
spirit
and
dulled
the
beating
of
my
heart
a
sudden
thought
did
light
up
a
fresh
hope
within
me
for
indeed
as
you
do
know
i
was
come
upward
of
a
great
height
and
did
surely
have
a
huge
view
over
all
that
land
and
mayhaps
the
lesser
pyramid
did
lie
somewhere
in
a
valley
if
in
verity
it
did
be
anywheres
at
all
in
that
country
and
i
turned
me
from
the
cliffs
and
lookt
backward
over
all
the
night
of
the
land
but
there
was
nowhere
in
all
that
country
the
shining
of
the
lights
of
the
lesser
pyramid
and
lo
of
a
sudden
i
did
know
that
there
was
something
in
the
night
and
i
stared
with
a
very
keen
and
anxious
look
and
behold
there
was
the
black
shape
of
a
great
pyramid
afar
off
in
the
night
that
did
show
against
the
shining
of
the
distant
light
for
it
did
stand
between
me
and
the
faroff
fires
but
until
i
was
come
to
that
place
whence
i
did
look
i
had
not
stood
to
have
it
plain
against
the
shining
upon
the
other
side
of
that
land
and
how
i
did
feel
in
that
moment
i
have
no
words
to
set
out
unto
you
but
surely
was
my
heart
gracious
with
thankfulness
and
i
ready
to
leap
with
joy
and
hope
and
all
my
body
thrilled
with
an
excitement
that
would
not
have
me
to
be
silent
so
that
suddenly
i
began
to
shout
foolishly
across
the
night
but
i
came
soon
to
wisdom
and
silence
as
you
shall
think
x
the
maid
of
the
olden
days
now
as
you
shall
perceive
all
mine
utter
despair
was
turned
in
a
moment
into
an
huge
gladness
and
a
great
hope
so
that
it
did
seem
to
me
that
i
should
be
with
my
dear
one
in
but
a
little
while
yet
was
this
an
overhope
and
expectation
and
was
not
like
to
have
a
swift
satisfying
for
truly
i
was
made
aware
of
naught
save
that
i
did
perceive
the
shape
of
a
great
pyramid
going
upward
into
the
night
and
i
knew
that
the
pyramid
did
surely
stand
upon
an
hill
in
the
midst
of
that
dark
country
for
only
so
might
it
show
so
great
and
high
and
i
set
me
to
run
swift
downward
into
the
land
so
that
i
should
make
a
strong
going
unto
the
pyramid
and
i
ran
for
a
few
little
minutes
and
lo
i
fell
headlong
and
did
truly
feel
as
that
i
had
brake
my
neck
with
the
hardness
and
pain
of
my
fall
and
i
had
no
power
to
go
forward
any
more
for
a
great
while
but
did
just
be
there
where
i
did
fall
and
very
helpless
and
moaning
a
little
so
that
any
creature
had
been
able
to
slay
me
if
that
it
had
come
upon
me
in
that
time
yet
presently
i
was
able
to
sit
upon
the
earth
and
did
hold
my
neck
with
my
hands
and
afterward
the
pain
went
away
so
that
i
gat
once
more
to
my
feet
but
now
i
went
forward
very
wisely
and
had
moreover
an
anxiousness
in
my
heart
for
indeed
how
did
it
be
that
the
pyramid
was
so
utter
dark
if
that
it
did
be
the
lesser
refuge
in
truth
and
immediately
there
did
rise
in
me
a
fear
that
it
should
be
some
house
of
evil
in
the
dark
of
that
land
or
some
wicked
force
working
a
pretence
and
a
bewilderment
upon
my
sight
yet
truly
the
thing
was
plain
now
against
the
faroff
fires
of
the
land
and
i
did
have
little
thought
but
that
it
should
be
in
verity
the
lesser
refuge
now
in
the
first
moment
that
i
did
perceive
the
dark
pyramid
i
had
been
without
wit
save
to
run
very
quick
and
blind
unto
the
place
for
you
to
remember
how
long
i
had
made
so
great
a
search
and
afterward
i
had
been
minded
to
call
unto
naani
with
my
brainelements
sending
the
masterword
and
my
speech
after
to
tell
how
that
i
was
come
unto
her
but
now
i
did
heed
to
have
caution
and
to
discover
what
this
darkness
should
truly
mean
and
so
did
i
go
downward
again
into
the
night
of
that
land
at
the
first
with
a
carefulness
but
presently
with
a
fierce
eagerness
and
expecting
of
the
heart
the
which
had
been
dulled
a
little
time
with
the
horrid
shaking
and
pain
of
my
fall
now
i
had
climbed
unto
the
upper
plain
of
the
great
volcano
in
maybe
thirteen
hours
but
i
went
downward
of
that
great
hill
in
ten
and
had
made
a
greater
speed
but
that
i
was
sore
shaken
and
unsure
by
reason
of
my
fall
and
in
the
end
of
the
tenth
hour
i
perceived
that
i
was
come
again
to
the
great
plain
of
the
land
and
i
had
no
more
any
proper
sight
of
the
refuge
because
that
it
was
upward
afar
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
yet
was
i
abled
now
to
see
that
there
went
a
bulk
between
me
and
the
far
shinings
and
did
know
that
this
great
thing
was
surely
the
hill
on
which
the
pyramid
did
stand
and
i
went
four
hours
across
the
land
and
did
pass
in
this
place
and
that
fireholes
that
made
a
little
redshining
in
the
night
and
because
of
the
fires
in
those
far
parts
and
anear
there
was
not
an
utter
dark
and
when
i
was
gone
four
hours
towards
the
pyramid
i
could
no
more
see
the
distant
shinings
for
the
bulk
of
the
hillbottom
stood
up
between
and
made
all
a
blackness
that
way
and
by
this
thing
i
did
guess
that
i
was
come
nigh
unto
the
hill
but
yet
was
a
great
hour
more
before
that
i
came
to
it
and
in
that
five
hours
since
i
was
come
down
from
the
great
volcano
there
had
past
me
thrice
and
again
the
sounds
of
things
running
in
the
night
and
once
there
did
be
a
sound
as
of
a
giant
roaring
afar
and
a
strange
and
horrid
screaming
now
i
began
to
go
up
the
hill
and
at
the
first
an
utter
excitement
took
me
in
the
heart
so
that
i
could
have
shouted
the
name
of
the
maid
aloud
in
the
night
with
vain
hopings
that
she
should
hear
me
and
make
an
answer
but
this
state
went
from
me
very
swift
as
i
did
go
upward
and
there
came
a
caution
again
about
me
and
a
coldness
of
fear
as
that
my
spirit
did
wot
of
something
that
my
heart
did
not
perceive
and
presently
i
was
come
upward
almost
to
the
top
of
the
hill
the
which
took
me
nigh
three
hours
and
surely
when
i
was
come
that
i
could
see
the
grimness
of
the
pyramid
going
upward
very
desolate
and
silent
into
the
night
lo
an
utter
shaking
fear
did
take
me
for
the
sweet
cunning
of
my
spirit
did
know
that
there
abode
no
human
in
all
that
great
and
dark
bulk
but
that
there
did
await
me
there
monstrous
and
horrid
things
that
should
bring
destruction
upon
my
soul
and
i
went
downward
of
the
hill
very
quiet
in
the
darkness
and
so
in
the
end
away
from
that
place
and
i
was
four
great
hours
before
that
i
was
come
clear
away
from
the
hill
and
i
did
feel
that
there
was
not
any
safety
for
my
spirit
in
all
that
land
and
surely
i
went
a
little
blindly
in
the
first
and
did
go
with
no
heed
unto
my
way
and
presently
i
was
upon
the
shore
of
the
olden
sea
and
had
no
knowing
how
that
i
was
come
there
for
surely
i
did
think
it
to
be
a
great
way
off
but
now
i
do
think
that
the
dry
bed
of
the
sea
did
curve
around
unto
that
place
or
that
there
did
be
two
or
more
olden
seas
in
that
country
of
night
now
presently
i
sat
me
down
very
weak
and
bewildered
for
it
was
as
that
my
heart
did
lie
dead
within
me
and
in
verity
you
shall
perceive
how
this
thing
was
for
i
did
know
by
the
tellings
of
my
spirit
that
there
abode
evil
things
in
the
dark
pyramid
upon
the
hill
and
i
doubted
not
but
that
destruction
had
come
upon
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
pyramid
and
that
evil
creatures
and
powers
did
now
abide
in
that
place
and
if
this
thing
did
be
truly
so
i
was
come
overlate
to
the
saving
of
the
maid
and
with
this
thought
i
was
very
glad
that
some
evil
thing
should
come
that
i
should
fight
with
it
and
die
quickly
for
there
was
naught
then
in
all
the
world
to
make
me
glad
to
have
life
and
so
shall
you
know
the
utter
desolation
that
was
in
my
heart
and
truly
i
can
perceive
both
the
wiseness
and
the
unwisdom
of
my
reasonings
for
indeed
i
did
have
no
sure
knowing
that
the
dark
pyramid
did
be
truly
the
lesser
refuge
but
yet
in
verity
my
spirit
did
know
with
a
certain
sureness
and
there
was
no
doubt
concerning
this
thing
in
all
my
being
and
after
that
i
had
sat
there
awhile
i
did
mind
me
suddenly
that
i
should
send
the
masterword
through
the
night
for
indeed
how
else
might
i
ever
know
whether
naani
did
yet
live
though
in
truth
i
had
little
save
desperate
hope
in
this
matter
but
yet
did
remember
how
that
i
had
seemed
odd
times
of
my
journey
to
hear
the
beat
of
the
masterword
with
my
spirit
out
of
all
the
dark
of
the
world
and
in
verity
if
naani
answered
not
to
the
word
but
there
came
instead
an
evil
power
to
destroy
me
i
should
but
cease
me
of
mine
utter
heartache
and
i
stood
me
upon
my
feet
and
looked
outward
about
me
into
the
blackness
of
that
land
and
i
sent
the
masterword
with
my
brainelements
and
immediately
i
called
naani
thrice
sending
the
call
with
my
brainelements
and
lo
in
a
moment
as
it
did
seem
there
broke
around
me
out
of
all
the
mystery
of
night
low
and
solemn
the
masterword
beating
in
the
night
and
immediately
there
did
sound
within
my
brain
a
far
small
voice
very
lone
and
faint
as
that
it
had
come
from
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
naani
and
the
voice
of
mirdath
and
did
call
me
by
mine
olden
lovename
then
indeed
i
did
near
to
choke
with
the
utter
affright
of
joy
that
did
take
me
in
the
heart
and
also
i
was
shaken
with
a
mighty
excitement
and
my
despair
was
gone
as
that
i
had
never
known
it
for
in
verity
naani
did
live
and
did
call
unto
me
with
her
brainelements
and
surely
i
had
not
heard
the
voice
of
mine
own
for
an
utter
age
of
grim
labour
and
dread
and
the
voice
was
as
i
did
say
as
that
it
came
from
one
that
did
be
in
a
far
place
of
the
earth
and
in
verity
whilst
i
stood
dazed
with
a
great
joy
that
the
maid
did
live
i
knew
within
me
concerning
the
fear
that
she
was
utter
far
off
and
what
peril
might
come
anigh
to
her
before
that
i
should
stand
to
her
side
to
do
battle
for
her
life
and
wellbeing
and
mine
own
joy
and
lo
in
the
same
moment
and
before
that
i
made
further
speech
unto
naani
i
did
wot
that
someone
did
be
a
little
way
off
from
me
in
the
bushes
where
a
firehole
did
burn
anigh
to
me
and
it
was
as
that
my
spirit
knew
this
thing
and
told
of
it
unto
my
brain
and
i
made
no
answer
unto
the
maid
across
all
the
dark
of
the
world
but
went
very
swift
into
a
great
bush
that
was
nigh
to
the
firehole
upon
this
side
and
i
lookt
through
into
the
open
space
that
did
be
about
the
firehole
and
there
was
a
little
figure
that
did
kneel
sobbing
upon
the
earth
beside
the
firehole
and
truly
it
was
a
slim
maid
and
she
did
seem
as
that
she
harked
very
desperate
even
whilst
yet
she
did
sob
and
surely
mine
own
soul
did
know
all
in
one
white
moment
of
life
and
she
there
unknowing
and
harking
unto
a
cry
of
the
spirit
that
she
did
think
to
come
through
all
the
desolation
of
the
nighteven
from
the
mighty
pyramid
for
oft
as
i
did
perceive
had
she
cried
unto
me
in
all
that
lonesome
month
and
known
no
answer
neither
that
i
was
making
a
desperate
way
unto
her
for
indeed
her
weakness
was
great
so
that
she
had
no
power
to
throw
the
word
strongly
afar
neither
to
make
plain
her
spiritual
cryings
through
any
mighty
space
of
the
aether
and
lo
i
drew
in
my
breath
and
set
my
teeth
a
moment
to
steady
my
lips
and
i
said
mirdath
out
of
the
bush
where
i
did
be
and
using
natural
human
speech
and
the
maid
ceased
from
her
weeping
and
lookt
this
way
and
that
with
an
utter
new
fear
and
with
a
frightened
hope
that
did
shine
with
her
tears
in
the
light
from
the
firehole
and
i
divided
the
bush
before
me
and
went
through
the
bush
so
that
i
came
out
before
her
and
did
be
there
in
my
grey
armour
and
i
did
pause
then
and
was
all
adrift
in
myself
for
my
heart
said
that
i
should
take
this
maid
into
mine
arms
again
for
that
i
was
come
again
to
be
with
mirdath
after
an
utter
lost
eternity
but
yet
was
i
all
paused
for
truly
she
was
naani
and
she
was
mirdath
and
she
did
be
a
stranger
in
mine
eyes
and
very
dainty
and
pretty
and
shaken
with
woe
and
sore
trouble
and
grief
and
in
that
same
moment
of
my
coming
unto
her
out
of
the
bush
she
screamed
and
fell
back
from
me
and
strove
weakly
to
gain
unto
the
hither
bushes
for
truly
she
knew
not
what
was
come
upon
her
in
that
first
little
moment
and
immediately
she
saw
that
it
did
be
an
human
man
and
no
monster
to
slay
her
and
in
that
instant
i
said
the
masterword
unto
her
aloud
that
she
should
have
knowledge
of
peace
and
help
and
i
told
my
name
and
said
i
am
that
one
and
she
knew
this
thing
even
as
my
lips
made
the
sounds
and
she
cried
out
something
in
an
utter
broke
voice
and
ran
unto
me
and
thrust
her
two
small
hands
into
my
charge
and
keeping
and
fell
thence
into
a
great
sobbing
and
shaking
so
that
i
was
all
in
trouble
to
ease
her
but
did
keep
a
silence
and
held
fast
her
hands
for
i
had
not
on
mine
armoured
gloves
and
she
leaned
against
me
very
weak
and
seeming
wondrous
like
to
a
child
and
lo
in
a
while
she
ceased
to
sob
and
did
but
catch
her
breath
this
time
and
that
but
said
no
word
and
i
bethought
me
that
she
did
suffer
of
hunger
for
i
perceived
that
she
had
been
long
wandering
and
alone
and
was
come
unto
the
end
of
hope
when
that
i
did
come
and
the
maid
stood
there
yet
silent
for
she
might
not
yet
command
her
mouth
to
speak
and
she
trembled
as
she
stood
and
i
opened
my
left
hand
and
lookt
at
the
hand
within
my
palm
and
surely
it
was
utter
thin
and
wasted
and
i
made
no
more
pause
but
lifted
mine
own
and
set
her
easy
upon
the
earth
with
an
hump
of
smooth
rock
unto
her
back
and
i
stript
off
my
cloak
very
quick
and
put
it
about
her
for
she
was
scarce
covered
with
her
clothes
that
had
been
all
torn
among
the
bushes
so
that
part
she
shook
with
an
utter
chill
and
part
because
of
weakness
for
she
was
nigh
to
be
starved
unto
her
death
and
destroyed
with
her
grief
and
lonesomeness
and
i
took
from
my
back
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
i
gat
a
tablet
from
the
scrip
and
brake
it
into
my
cup
and
with
the
water
i
made
a
little
broth
very
swift
upon
an
hot
rock
that
was
to
the
edge
of
the
firehole
and
i
fed
the
broth
unto
the
maid
for
truly
her
hands
did
shake
so
that
she
had
spilt
it
all
if
that
i
had
done
otherwise
and
she
drank
the
broth
and
was
so
weak
that
presently
she
did
fall
again
to
sobbing
yet
very
quiet
so
that
i
strove
not
to
be
troubled
in
the
heart
for
indeed
this
thing
was
but
reasonable
and
not
cause
for
me
to
have
an
anxiousness
but
i
put
my
hands
under
the
cloak
and
took
her
hands
into
mine
and
held
them
strong
and
firm
and
this
did
seem
to
bring
something
of
peace
and
strength
unto
her
so
that
presently
the
trembling
and
the
weeping
went
from
her
and
indeed
the
broth
was
surely
helpful
in
this
matter
and
presently
i
knew
that
her
hands
did
stir
a
little
within
mine
and
i
loosed
somewhat
of
my
grip
and
immediately
she
graspt
my
hands
with
a
weak
and
gentle
grasp
but
lookt
not
yet
at
me
only
did
stay
very
quiet
as
that
she
did
gather
her
strength
within
her
and
indeed
i
was
content
save
that
an
anxiousness
of
the
heart
did
stir
me
this
time
and
that
lest
some
monster
should
come
upon
us
and
because
of
this
trouble
i
did
hark
about
me
now
and
oft
and
with
a
new
and
strange
fearfulness
of
danger
because
that
now
mine
own
was
given
unto
my
charge
and
surely
my
heart
would
break
if
that
there
came
any
hurt
unto
her
now
of
a
sudden
the
maid
did
make
as
that
she
would
rise
and
i
loosed
free
from
her
to
give
help
and
she
gat
me
by
the
hand
and
slipt
sudden
to
her
knees
and
did
kiss
my
hand
and
did
begin
again
to
weep
and
surely
i
was
so
utter
abashed
that
i
stood
very
stupid
and
let
her
do
this
thing
but
in
a
moment
i
drew
free
from
her
for
this
thing
might
not
be
and
i
gat
me
to
my
knee
likewise
before
her
and
took
her
hands
and
kist
them
once
newly
humbled
as
it
were
and
thus
should
she
know
all
that
was
in
my
heart
and
of
mine
understanding
and
she
did
but
sob
the
more
for
she
was
so
weak
and
utter
moved
unto
me
because
that
i
had
come
to
her
through
the
night
of
the
world
and
this
thing
i
knew
though
no
speech
had
yet
past
between
us
and
i
gave
up
her
hands
lest
she
need
them
for
her
tears
but
she
left
them
to
lie
in
my
palms
as
she
did
kneel
there
and
she
bowed
her
head
a
little
over
her
weeping
but
did
show
that
she
was
mine
in
verity
unto
the
very
essence
of
her
dear
spirit
and
i
took
her
into
mine
arms
very
gently
and
without
caress
but
presently
i
stroked
her
hair
and
called
her
naani
and
mirdath
and
said
many
things
unto
her
that
now
i
scarce
do
wot
of
but
she
did
know
them
in
the
after
time
and
she
was
very
quiet
in
mine
arms
and
seeming
wondrous
content
but
yet
did
sob
onward
for
a
great
time
and
oft
did
i
coax
her
and
say
vague
things
of
comfort
as
i
have
told
but
truly
she
did
ask
no
more
comfort
at
that
time
than
that
she
be
sheltered
where
she
did
be
and
truly
she
had
been
lonesome
and
in
terror
and
in
grief
and
dread
a
great
and
horrid
time
now
presently
she
was
grown
quiet
and
i
made
to
put
her
comfortable
in
the
cloak
against
the
rock
that
i
should
have
freedom
to
make
her
more
of
the
broth
but
yet
she
did
nestle
unto
me
with
a
little
sweet
wistfulness
that
made
warm
my
heart
in
a
most
wondrous
fashion
for
surely
she
was
mine
own
and
she
to
begin
to
say
odd
words
to
me
and
so
to
have
gentle
obedience
and
to
rest
quiet
against
the
rock
the
while
that
i
did
make
the
broth
yet
ever
her
gaze
did
follow
me
as
i
knew
for
i
must
look
oft
her
way
and
i
took
the
broth
to
her
and
she
drank
it
using
her
own
two
hands
and
i
sat
by
and
eat
three
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
for
truly
it
was
a
foolish
great
time
since
last
i
had
eat
now
in
a
while
the
broth
did
make
bright
the
eyes
of
the
maid
and
she
did
begin
to
talk
and
at
whiles
had
pauses
because
that
she
lacked
of
strength
and
there
was
more
to
be
told
than
an
human
may
have
the
heartstrength
and
cunning
to
make
plain
and
twice
she
did
come
again
to
sobbing
for
truly
her
father
was
dead
and
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
all
slain
and
dispersed
through
the
night
of
that
land
and
i
learned
that
an
evil
force
had
made
action
upon
the
peoples
within
the
lesser
redoubt
so
that
some
being
utter
weak
by
reason
of
the
failing
of
the
earthcurrent
had
opened
the
great
door
and
gone
forth
into
the
night
and
immediately
there
had
come
into
the
lesser
pyramid
great
and
horrid
monsters
and
had
made
a
great
and
brutish
chase
and
had
slain
many
but
some
had
escaped
forth
into
the
night
and
with
these
had
come
naani
after
that
her
father
the
master
monstruwacan
had
been
slain
by
a
shaggy
man
very
brutal
and
monstrous
and
there
had
been
three
maids
with
naani
when
that
she
made
escape
into
the
night
but
there
had
come
certain
creatures
upon
them
as
they
did
sleep
among
the
bushes
and
had
stolen
two
and
the
other
maid
had
run
off
as
did
naani
and
they
had
neither
met
the
other
any
more
and
this
dreadful
happening
unto
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
had
been
a
great
while
gone
as
it
to
seem
to
her
but
she
had
no
means
to
tell
me
how
long
this
time
should
be
for
in
verity
how
should
she
make
a
count
yet
had
it
been
a
dread
long
while
unto
her
and
i
found
presently
that
she
had
been
lost
through
all
that
time
that
i
did
make
my
journey
unto
her
for
indeed
this
thing
i
discovered
by
asking
concerning
my
callings
unto
her
and
she
had
heard
none
that
did
come
to
her
in
any
time
since
she
had
escaped
out
of
the
lost
refuge
into
this
dreadful
land
yet
in
verity
oft
had
she
callen
unto
me
until
that
her
heart
did
grow
sick
with
the
desolation
of
her
lonesomeness
and
her
utter
forsakeness
and
her
callings
had
told
unto
the
evil
things
of
the
land
that
she
did
be
in
this
part
and
that
for
there
had
come
things
and
beasts
in
search
for
her
but
having
the
gift
of
the
hearing
she
had
known
of
their
approach
most
whiles
and
had
come
free
from
them
yet
ofttimes
with
piteous
and
fearful
runnings
and
hiding
among
the
rocks
and
the
bushes
so
that
she
had
grown
afterward
to
make
no
calling
unto
me
save
odd
whiles
lest
she
bring
the
monsters
upon
her
and
indeed
as
you
do
know
naught
had
come
plain
unto
me
for
she
was
so
utter
weak
that
she
had
no
power
of
her
brainelements
to
send
the
word
afar
or
the
tellings
of
her
spirit
and
because
that
she
was
so
sorely
chased
she
had
come
nigh
to
be
naked
even
as
i
found
her
for
the
bushes
and
the
rocks
had
torn
her
garments
from
her
and
she
had
naught
with
which
to
make
any
proper
mending
of
them
and
for
food
she
had
eat
the
moss
upon
the
rocks
and
odd
strange
berries
and
growths
and
had
drunk
of
the
waters
of
the
hot
springs
and
oft
had
she
been
made
utter
sick
because
of
the
sulphur
or
somewhat
of
the
water
and
maybe
the
poison
of
odd
plants
yet
as
i
did
think
it
was
like
that
the
first
did
save
her
life
from
the
second
but
in
this
thing
i
do
make
only
a
guessing
and
in
all
that
dreadful
time
since
that
she
had
come
to
be
quite
alone
she
had
heard
a
score
drear
things
for
there
had
been
once
the
slaying
of
a
young
maid
nigh
unto
her
by
some
brute
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
land
and
thrice
and
more
had
she
heard
the
feet
of
people
running
this
way
and
that
and
the
tread
of
giants
pursuing
and
by
this
telling
i
did
understand
those
things
which
mine
ears
had
told
to
me
as
i
did
go
across
that
land
and
surely
a
new
pity
and
sorrow
and
horror
did
come
upward
within
me
and
the
maid
told
me
how
that
she
came
once
upon
certain
of
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
as
they
did
hide
among
the
bushes
but
they
ran
with
no
heed
to
her
callings
that
she
did
be
human
even
as
they
and
by
this
is
it
plain
the
sore
and
dreadful
panic
that
was
upon
the
hearts
of
such
and
the
bitter
chill
of
the
land
had
made
her
to
strive
alway
to
be
nigh
unto
the
fireholes
that
were
very
plentiful
but
even
as
this
did
be
needful
unto
her
so
was
it
a
thing
that
drew
the
monstrous
brutes
of
that
land
even
as
i
had
found
in
the
night
land
and
in
the
upward
gorge
and
because
of
this
she
was
oft
made
to
stay
afar
off
in
the
utter
cold
of
the
night
yet
in
truth
odd
whiles
she
did
be
so
desperate
that
she
would
make
the
venture
and
so
mayhaps
have
a
time
of
warmth
and
because
of
this
she
had
been
nigh
slain
in
her
sleep
twice
and
thrice
moreover
there
were
snakes
about
the
fires
though
not
overplentiful
in
all
parts
and
there
did
be
spidercrabs
and
monstrous
scorpions
and
indeed
even
as
she
had
lain
by
the
firehole
very
weak
and
seeming
near
unto
her
death
even
this
time
when
my
call
had
come
unto
her
to
stir
her
unto
life
and
bitter
knowledge
of
despair
even
then
was
she
all
surround
by
creatures
that
were
like
to
crabs
that
did
squat
all
about
her
and
did
but
wait
for
her
to
die
so
that
she
had
been
feared
to
sleep
lest
they
destroy
her
in
her
slumber
and
by
this
thing
she
had
known
that
her
death
was
surely
nigh
and
lo
out
of
all
the
night
of
the
world
had
come
the
beat
of
the
masterword
strong
and
powerful
beating
as
a
low
and
spiritual
thunder
out
of
all
the
dark
of
the
night
yet
had
she
thought
of
me
only
as
speaking
from
the
faroff
mighty
pyramid
so
that
the
cry
had
brought
naught
of
hope
unto
her
but
only
a
newer
and
more
known
despair
and
behold
in
a
little
minute
there
had
come
her
name
spoken
surely
with
the
tongue
and
a
name
that
was
different
from
the
name
that
my
spirit
had
said
after
the
beat
of
the
word
and
immediately
i
had
come
out
of
the
bush
and
she
had
fallen
back
in
a
sudden
great
fear
that
a
monster
was
stolen
upon
her
and
then
did
see
a
young
man
in
grey
armour
and
did
know
in
one
instant
that
i
was
that
olden
one
of
her
memory
dreams
and
the
one
that
had
spoken
unto
her
in
the
spirit
across
half
of
the
dead
world
as
it
did
seem
and
now
was
i
come
through
all
that
unknown
desolation
and
affright
to
succour
her
and
she
was
immediately
safe
but
yet
all
broken
because
of
her
weakness
and
her
utter
joy
and
her
sweet
honour
for
me
and
this
is
the
chief
of
that
which
she
did
tell
unto
me
and
the
way
that
she
had
seen
and
did
regard
the
marvel
of
this
our
coming
together
but
surely
no
man
was
made
ever
to
be
worthy
of
the
way
that
she
did
look
upon
me
or
of
the
words
that
she
did
say
unto
me
in
her
weakness
and
happiness
now
with
the
maid
having
speech
concerning
the
spidercrabs
i
lookt
presently
well
around
and
surely
in
a
minute
i
saw
that
they
were
not
gone
away
but
did
be
a
circle
of
silent
and
steadfast
watching
and
impudence
and
horror
all
about
us
and
surely
this
thing
put
an
anger
and
disgust
upon
me
so
that
i
gat
to
my
feet
and
went
unto
the
border
of
the
light
and
i
spurned
this
little
monster
and
that
and
did
truly
kick
maybe
a
dozen
before
that
they
were
content
to
be
gone
and
by
this
thing
shall
you
know
of
their
calm
and
foolish
assurance
but
yet
were
they
seemingly
without
courage
for
they
made
not
to
attack
me
yet
a
true
crab
of
this
day
been
wishful
to
pinch
me
had
i
put
my
toe
forth
unto
it
now
i
went
back
to
the
maid
and
she
did
laugh
with
a
little
weak
gleefulness
so
that
i
perceived
that
she
was
like
to
be
a
very
joyous
maiden
if
but
i
did
have
her
in
health
and
i
made
her
another
cup
of
the
broth
and
she
drank
it
very
easy
and
afterward
i
made
a
very
stern
and
playful
order
that
she
must
sleep
and
indeed
she
to
need
it
sore
for
she
was
gone
again
from
her
excitement
and
her
weakness
upon
her
yet
very
happy
and
content
and
without
fear
and
i
made
a
smooth
place
for
her
and
put
the
pouch
and
the
scrip
to
be
for
a
pillow
and
i
did
lay
her
there
very
quiet
and
sweet
in
the
cloak
and
covered
her
feet
but
indeed
i
saw
first
that
they
did
be
sore
cut
and
without
any
gear
to
them
so
that
i
perceived
that
mine
own
had
worn
out
her
footgear
utter
in
her
lonesome
journeyings
and
in
running
from
brutes
that
did
come
to
find
her
and
so
i
to
know
more
in
the
heart
somewhat
of
the
true
dreadfulness
and
fear
that
had
companioned
mine
own
and
i
was
minded
then
that
i
would
wash
and
bind
up
her
feet
but
yet
was
she
so
utter
worn
that
i
did
prefer
that
she
sleep
so
soon
as
she
might
and
afterward
when
she
was
come
wakeful
again
then
should
i
take
a
proper
heed
of
her
feet
and
truly
they
were
very
small
and
shapely
and
presently
she
slept
and
surely
i
doubt
whether
she
had
slumbered
so
peaceful
and
proper
for
a
great
month
for
she
never
to
have
known
when
any
evil
thing
should
come
upon
her
in
her
sleep
and
this
to
be
a
very
dreadful
feeling
as
you
do
know
well
for
you
do
know
how
i
had
been
in
this
same
matter
now
while
naani
did
sleep
i
stript
off
mine
armour
and
took
off
mine
undersuit
which
was
named
the
armoursuit
and
a
very
warm
and
proper
garment
and
made
thick
that
it
should
ease
the
chafe
of
the
armour
and
afterward
i
put
on
the
armour
again
but
the
suit
i
folded
and
laid
beside
the
maid
for
truly
she
was
nigh
unclothed
by
reason
of
the
bushes
and
the
rocks
that
had
rent
her
garments
allwise
and
i
stood
watch
for
the
maid
the
while
that
she
did
slumber
and
surely
she
went
ten
long
hours
and
i
walked
upon
this
side
of
the
firehole
and
now
upon
that
and
did
oft
cease
that
i
might
hearken
both
with
mine
ears
and
with
my
spirit
for
truly
i
was
all
wakened
to
a
new
care
and
delight
and
did
have
a
fresh
and
doubled
fear
of
any
horrid
creature
or
force
of
evil
and
this
shall
be
very
plain
to
you
and
in
the
end
of
ten
long
hours
the
maid
wakened
and
i
ran
to
her
all
joyed
that
she
was
come
again
to
knowledge
and
to
be
that
i
could
talk
with
her
and
she
sat
upward
and
looked
at
me
and
there
was
new
light
and
movement
in
her
so
that
i
knew
her
strength
was
come
back
into
her
and
for
a
little
minute
she
said
naught
unto
me
the
while
that
i
did
ask
how
she
did
be
and
she
lookt
at
me
very
keen
so
that
i
wondered
some
wise
in
a
daze
what
was
in
her
mind
and
she
askt
me
of
a
sudden
how
long
it
did
be
since
that
i
had
slept
and
having
not
thought
to
put
away
her
asking
because
that
the
question
was
over
sudden
i
said
fourandeighty
hours
which
should
be
three
days
and
the
half
of
a
day
of
four
hours
and
twenty
and
this
thing
i
knew
because
that
i
kept
alway
a
very
careful
counting
of
the
hours
lest
that
i
get
all
adrift
and
know
not
how
long
i
was
taken
to
come
to
this
place
and
that
and
truly
even
as
i
told
this
thing
to
the
maid
i
was
grown
very
quaint
in
the
head
for
indeed
i
was
gone
a
wondrous
while
without
slumber
and
had
done
much
and
bitter
work
in
that
time
and
before
then
had
been
much
lacking
of
rest
as
you
do
know
and
sudden
the
maid
cried
out
something
and
tost
the
cloak
from
her
and
had
me
into
her
arms
and
did
heed
not
to
have
any
foolish
shame
of
her
nakedness
and
in
verity
i
knew
not
how
i
was
gone
so
strange
but
do
see
now
that
i
was
nigh
to
swoon
for
lack
of
slumber
and
rest
and
she
kept
me
very
steady
for
a
little
and
afterward
helped
me
to
be
laid
upon
the
ground
and
she
put
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
under
my
head
and
so
i
did
lie
very
calm
and
restful
and
did
be
the
more
so
because
that
i
was
grown
so
tired
in
the
heart
the
which
did
make
my
head
to
be
very
husht
as
that
all
the
world
was
grown
very
quiet
in
a
moment
and
the
maid
did
mind
then
that
she
did
lack
to
be
properly
covered
and
she
gat
the
cloak
and
put
it
about
her
and
did
afterward
sit
a
little
beside
me
and
did
rub
my
hands
and
presently
i
was
something
more
to
myself
and
she
did
grow
more
happy
of
her
mind
and
made
to
give
me
something
for
my
stomach
for
indeed
i
was
grown
those
late
hours
to
be
foolish
and
to
have
no
wiseness
to
proper
eating
and
she
did
lift
my
head
the
while
that
she
did
take
the
scrip
from
under
and
kept
me
very
sweetly
upon
her
knee
and
so
until
she
had
gat
free
a
pack
of
the
tablets
and
the
flask
and
the
cup
for
i
had
put
all
matters
back
into
the
scrip
before
naani
had
gone
unto
sleep
and
because
of
this
i
had
not
been
able
to
eat
or
drink
aught
save
by
wakening
her
as
you
perceive
for
indeed
i
had
put
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
under
her
head
for
a
pillow
as
i
have
told
and
she
would
not
bide
that
i
should
do
aught
but
only
did
ask
concerning
the
making
of
the
water
and
was
wondrous
amazed
to
see
how
the
powder
did
fizz
up
and
become
water
and
indeed
she
had
too
much
into
the
cup
for
truly
it
rose
up
and
ran
to
the
ground
and
when
she
had
done
thus
and
ceased
to
marvel
she
put
three
of
the
tablets
into
the
water
and
made
me
a
broth
even
as
i
had
made
a
broth
for
her
but
indeed
i
was
in
no
need
and
had
done
very
well
to
eat
the
tablets
and
drink
the
water
yet
truly
i
was
not
wishful
to
lack
the
love
of
her
way
as
you
may
think
now
while
i
did
drink
the
broth
i
did
be
very
restful
upon
the
earth
and
mine
head
against
mine
own
maid
and
i
did
mind
me
now
that
i
tell
her
concerning
the
armoursuit
that
i
did
mean
for
her
wear
yet
i
said
not
that
i
had
stript
it
from
me
for
then
she
had
been
like
to
say
nay
and
to
trouble
that
i
was
like
to
come
to
a
chill
as
is
the
way
of
a
woman
but
indeed
i
might
so
well
have
told
her
for
truly
she
did
know
on
the
moment
and
set
to
a
little
unto
weeping
yet
very
gentle
and
sweet
and
did
kiss
me
as
i
lay
there
and
say
such
things
as
should
make
a
young
man
the
better
to
have
heard
if
but
that
his
own
dear
love
doth
say
the
same
and
she
would
nowise
wear
the
garment
but
yet
in
the
end
i
prevailed
by
gentle
reasonings
and
because
that
i
was
her
master
as
i
was
born
to
be
and
moreover
her
own
sweet
sense
did
show
that
i
spoke
for
wisdom
for
how
should
she
come
through
all
the
bitter
way
before
if
that
she
had
not
a
strong
and
closemade
garment
and
as
you
do
mind
her
coverings
did
be
in
utter
rags
as
i
have
told
yet
very
sweet
and
clean
as
i
had
known
so
that
i
ween
she
had
stript
oft
in
the
lonesome
night
and
washt
her
garments
in
this
or
that
hot
spring
of
the
sulphur
waters
and
other
matters
and
in
verity
alway
she
was
much
given
to
washings
as
i
did
soon
perceive
now
presently
i
did
be
very
well
again
but
with
a
sore
slumber
that
did
press
upon
my
head
yet
ere
i
should
sleep
i
did
mean
that
i
bathe
her
feet
and
bind
them
with
ointment
and
with
my
pocketcloth
and
truly
her
feet
were
very
small
and
pretty
and
i
sat
me
up
talking
my
head
from
her
knee
and
told
her
of
mine
intent
but
in
verity
she
did
but
throw
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
give
me
one
loving
kiss
and
laught
so
hearty
that
i
did
think
to
do
this
thing
when
indeed
she
was
the
better
able
to
mind
it
and
i
the
better
suited
to
have
me
to
my
rest
and
surely
this
was
very
true
and
i
made
no
ado
save
to
give
her
the
ointment
but
lay
back
and
did
be
quiet
now
i
did
be
upon
my
right
side
and
she
went
to
my
back
and
took
the
cloak
from
about
her
and
spread
it
upon
me
and
afterward
stoopt
over
very
dainty
and
kist
me
and
bade
me
to
go
very
swift
to
my
sleep
for
that
she
did
mean
to
make
her
toilet
and
to
get
into
mine
armoursuit
and
i
made
no
foolishness
in
this
matter
yet
told
her
to
ease
the
cloak
a
little
about
me
so
that
i
should
have
room
to
take
the
diskos
from
my
hip
and
this
thing
i
did
and
took
the
diskos
to
my
breast
as
was
my
habit
and
surely
i
saw
that
her
eyes
did
look
at
me
with
a
little
shining
because
that
i
had
so
strange
and
fierce
a
bedmate
and
i
made
her
to
promise
that
she
keep
a
very
keen
harking
the
which
was
like
that
she
should
do
and
to
call
me
on
the
instant
that
she
did
perceive
any
unease
in
the
night
and
after
that
i
shut
mine
eyes
that
i
should
not
shame
her
and
put
out
mine
arms
and
kist
her
once
and
turned
from
her
unto
my
slumber
and
she
away
to
my
back
that
she
might
be
modest
to
her
needs
and
surely
i
was
asleep
in
but
a
little
moment
and
with
a
great
love
and
delight
in
my
heart
and
in
all
my
being
and
truly
i
waked
not
for
twelve
great
hours
and
when
that
time
was
gone
lo
i
came
awake
and
surely
the
maid
did
sit
beside
me
so
bonny
and
so
winsome
and
pretty
that
mine
arms
went
unto
her
in
a
moment
and
she
into
them
and
gave
me
a
loving
and
tender
kiss
and
afterward
slipt
away
from
me
very
sensible
and
loving
and
did
stand
up
and
turn
about
to
be
lookt
at
for
she
did
wear
the
armoursuit
and
surely
it
was
loose
upon
her
but
yet
very
pleasing
being
closeknit
and
i
to
my
seat
from
lying
that
i
might
see
the
maid
the
better
and
in
verity
i
must
kiss
her
again
for
she
did
be
with
her
hair
all
about
her
that
she
look
pretty
unto
me
and
her
little
feet
did
be
bare
and
so
that
they
made
my
heart
new
tender
to
look
upon
them
for
truly
she
was
utter
lost
of
footgear
and
i
to
my
knee
to
her
and
she
not
to
deny
me
did
come
to
be
kist
again
now
when
i
found
how
great
a
time
i
had
slept
i
did
scold
mine
own
but
yet
as
she
did
say
i
must
have
long
slumber
if
that
i
go
so
long
wakeful
else
should
i
lose
my
strength
and
i
askt
how
oft
she
had
eat
and
she
told
me
but
the
once
and
that
six
hours
off
and
on
this
i
did
scold
again
but
surely
she
put
a
very
pretty
finger
sudden
upon
my
lips
so
that
i
might
do
naught
but
laugh
and
kiss
that
same
finger
and
after
that
we
did
eat
and
drink
and
made
plans
and
once
i
did
comfort
the
maid
for
indeed
her
sorrow
did
rise
in
her
because
that
her
father
was
come
unto
his
death
and
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
all
destroyed
and
adrift
in
the
night
amid
the
monsters
of
that
land
and
in
verity
i
was
set
that
we
go
quickly
out
of
that
place
ere
there
came
an
horrid
destruction
upon
us
and
surely
there
should
scarce
be
any
human
beside
in
all
that
land
for
there
must
have
come
death
upon
the
chief
of
those
that
did
make
escape
and
after
we
had
eat
and
drunk
i
did
count
the
packs
of
the
tablets
and
was
thankful
in
all
my
being
that
i
had
been
careful
and
denied
my
belly
for
i
did
perceive
that
there
were
left
enough
for
our
needs
if
that
we
made
a
good
speed
and
did
not
fear
to
be
empty
and
of
the
waterpowder
as
it
might
be
named
there
were
left
two
full
flasks
and
somewhat
of
that
one
that
i
had
drunk
from
all
my
journeying
and
by
this
thing
you
shall
perceive
that
we
did
not
be
like
to
die
for
the
need
of
such
matters
and
here
as
it
doth
occur
unto
me
i
do
ponder
how
it
did
be
that
we
had
no
thought
to
slay
any
small
creature
for
our
food
but
mayhap
we
had
no
knowledge
this
way
for
surely
they
did
not
this
thing
to
my
knowing
in
the
mighty
pyramid
but
yet
as
i
have
said
before
this
i
have
not
all
knowledge
of
the
doings
of
the
peoples
but
in
verity
i
never
saw
joint
meat
in
all
the
time
of
that
far
life
that
i
do
wot
of
yet
had
we
but
slain
somewhat
for
our
hunger
in
that
great
wandering
we
had
been
less
empty
in
the
belly
now
before
that
we
should
do
aught
beside
we
must
contrive
that
naani
have
some
gear
for
her
feet
and
to
this
intent
i
did
make
a
search
into
the
pouch
and
surely
i
found
that
there
did
be
a
change
pair
of
inner
shoes
that
were
made
to
go
within
mine
own
shoes
of
the
grey
metal
and
at
this
i
was
wondrous
glad
and
did
make
the
maid
to
sit
upon
a
little
rock
while
that
i
made
a
fitting
of
the
shoes
and
surely
they
did
be
utter
big
and
clumsy
upon
her
little
feet
so
that
i
was
in
surprise
to
know
how
great
is
a
man
beside
a
maid
but
in
the
end
i
had
a
cunning
thought
for
i
cut
off
all
the
side
of
a
strap
throughout
the
length
of
the
strap
very
thin
and
careful
and
so
had
a
lace
to
tie
the
boots
around
the
tops
which
were
soft
and
easy
for
such
a
purpose
and
after
that
i
stood
away
to
look
at
the
maid
and
neither
she
nor
i
were
truly
pleased
for
indeed
she
was
too
pretty
to
be
so
hid
and
muffled
yet
were
we
glad
otherwise
for
now
she
might
go
without
hurt
to
her
feet
and
afterward
we
packt
our
gear
and
she
did
make
a
bundle
of
her
torn
garments
for
truly
they
might
be
proper
somewise
to
our
need
and
so
we
to
begin
the
way
out
of
that
desolate
land
and
we
went
forward
together
across
the
land
and
the
journey
was
no
more
a
weariness
but
of
a
close
and
sweet
joy
yet
did
i
have
a
new
anxiousness
as
you
do
perceive
lest
that
any
monster
come
to
harm
mine
own
and
we
went
twelve
great
hours
in
the
bed
of
the
olden
sea
and
did
eat
twice
in
that
time
and
surely
the
maid
did
grow
utter
weak
and
weary
for
she
was
not
come
proper
unto
her
strength
yet
did
she
make
no
odd
saying
to
tell
me
of
this
thing
but
indeed
i
did
know
and
i
stopt
in
the
thirteenth
hour
and
took
her
into
mine
arms
even
as
i
should
carry
a
babe
and
i
went
forward
with
her
and
did
hush
her
protesting
with
a
kiss
and
afterward
she
did
but
nestle
unto
me
and
shelter
against
my
breast
and
i
bade
the
maid
to
sleep
but
indeed
she
had
no
power
to
this
end
for
her
body
did
ache
very
sore
but
yet
did
she
strive
to
give
me
an
obedience
in
this
thing
and
in
the
eighteenth
hour
when
that
i
stopt
to
have
food
and
drink
surely
she
did
be
awake
yet
had
she
been
utter
silent
and
i
made
to
scold
her
but
she
gat
from
mine
arms
and
did
go
upward
upon
her
toes
and
put
her
finger
against
my
lips
very
naughtily
and
afterward
she
did
be
impudent
unto
me
and
did
deny
me
to
kiss
her
but
she
went
unto
my
back
and
did
open
the
scrip
and
gat
me
to
my
food
even
as
a
quiet
and
proper
wife
should
go
as
she
did
be
so
sedate
that
i
knew
she
had
mischief
her
heart
of
harmless
kind
but
afterward
this
did
pass
sudden
into
weeping
for
she
had
a
quick
and
sore
memory
of
her
father
and
of
the
destruction
and
i
took
the
maid
into
mine
arms
and
did
let
her
be
there
very
gentle
and
made
not
to
kiss
or
to
comfort
her
but
yet
to
give
comfort
and
presently
she
ceased
from
weeping
and
did
slip
her
hand
into
mine
and
i
to
keep
it
within
very
soft
and
quiet
and
afterward
she
began
to
eat
her
tablets
yet
always
she
did
be
very
husht
so
that
i
did
be
quiet
also
and
feel
as
that
my
love
did
be
round
her
as
a
shield
and
i
knew
that
she
had
knowledge
of
this
thing
in
her
heart
and
oft
i
harked
into
the
night
of
the
land
but
there
was
nowhere
any
sound
or
disturbing
of
the
aether
to
trouble
me
and
the
maid
in
mine
arms
did
know
when
that
i
harked
for
in
verity
she
had
the
nighthearing
and
the
understanding
spirit
that
doth
be
needful
to
such
and
odd
whiles
did
i
look
down
to
her
through
the
gloom
that
did
be
about
us
and
presently
i
did
perceive
that
she
lookt
up
to
me
out
of
mine
arms
and
i
kist
her
now
in
all
that
day
we
had
come
nowhere
upon
any
firehole
in
the
bed
of
the
olden
sea
and
truly
i
did
ache
to
be
nigh
unto
the
warmth
of
such
for
i
did
feel
the
cold
of
the
land
because
that
i
was
weary
and
because
that
i
had
not
the
thickness
of
the
armoursuit
below
mine
armour
to
warm
me
and
the
cloak
did
be
about
the
maid
for
i
had
feared
that
she
should
grow
cold
as
i
carried
her
yet
now
she
did
know
subtly
that
i
was
come
to
feel
the
utter
chill
of
the
land
and
she
gat
from
mine
arms
and
put
the
cloak
about
me
and
afterward
came
again
into
mine
arms
and
i
let
the
cloak
bide
there
and
drew
it
forward
to
be
around
her
also
yet
truly
i
was
joyful
that
i
did
be
cold
as
you
shall
perceive
for
it
was
sweet
to
the
heart
to
bear
somewhat
of
that
dread
chill
for
mine
own
and
she
half
troubled
and
likewise
with
understanding
of
my
heart
because
that
i
was
less
clothed
than
i
had
been
now
in
a
little
while
the
maid
did
pack
the
scrip
and
so
we
did
make
ready
again
to
go
forward
for
i
was
grown
anxious
as
you
may
suppose
that
we
should
come
to
some
firehole
that
we
have
a
place
for
sleep
that
had
warmth
and
light
for
truly
the
cold
of
the
land
did
be
drear
and
horrid
and
i
stoopt
to
take
the
maid
into
mine
arms
that
i
should
carry
her
but
she
did
say
nay
that
she
did
be
well
rested
and
i
not
to
gainsay
her
for
she
did
mean
the
thing
as
i
perceived
and
i
had
no
desire
to
force
my
way
upon
her
save
when
i
saw
truly
that
she
did
seem
to
go
unwisely
and
indeed
when
such
did
be
the
case
i
did
strive
with
her
only
with
a
nice
reasonableness
as
you
shall
know
and
the
maid
walkt
by
my
side
and
wondrous
silent
but
yet
very
nigh
to
me
so
that
i
knew
she
did
be
very
full
of
love
to
me
and
of
that
quaint
and
sweet
humbleness
that
love
doth
breed
odd
whiles
in
a
woman
when
she
doth
be
with
her
man
if
but
that
man
be
also
her
master
and
presently
i
perceived
that
the
cloak
did
be
over
mine
own
shoulders
and
i
took
it
and
would
have
put
it
about
the
maid
but
truly
she
did
not
allow
this
and
when
i
did
be
stern
with
her
that
she
obey
me
in
this
matter
she
did
stand
upon
her
toes
that
she
might
kiss
me
and
pulled
my
head
down
and
surely
she
kist
me
and
coaxed
me
that
i
wear
the
cloak
else
should
i
give
pain
to
her
in
that
i
did
surely
be
cold
because
she
did
wear
the
armoursuit
yet
i
would
not
hark
to
this
thing
so
that
the
maid
did
be
truly
in
trouble
and
first
she
made
a
threatening
that
she
wear
but
her
olden
garments
that
did
be
only
rags
if
that
i
did
persist
but
this
i
saw
to
be
foolishness
and
scarcemeant
and
did
as
much
need
to
smile
at
her
as
that
i
did
think
to
scold
her
but
i
did
be
firm
that
she
wear
the
cloak
and
lo
she
went
sudden
into
crying
and
this
had
been
beyond
my
thoughts
and
truly
it
set
me
all
adrift
for
i
perceived
that
she
did
be
greatly
distrest
concerning
this
matter
when
i
had
conceived
that
she
did
but
mean
this
thing
for
tenderness
sake
but
mine
heart
helped
me
to
understand
and
i
saw
how
she
did
be
truly
shamed
in
her
sweet
womanhood
if
that
i
helped
her
not
in
this
matter
for
she
did
feel
that
she
was
made
to
do
hurt
unto
that
one
that
was
her
love
and
this
thing
i
do
pray
you
to
think
upon
that
you
understand
for
indeed
until
that
i
was
made
to
think
i
had
not
seen
it
thiswise
for
her
and
in
the
end
i
came
to
agreement
with
the
maid
that
we
wear
the
garment
hour
by
hour
in
turn
and
she
to
wear
it
the
first
hour
and
i
to
wear
it
the
second
hour
and
so
to
go
forward
and
truly
this
did
be
an
happy
arranging
but
yet
she
stampt
her
foot
a
little
as
i
put
the
cloak
about
her
and
thrice
in
the
hour
did
she
ask
me
concerning
the
time
that
was
gone
and
surely
when
the
hour
was
but
up
she
had
the
cloak
off
in
a
moment
and
went
to
my
back
and
cast
it
upon
my
shoulders
and
after
to
my
front
and
made
it
fast
upon
my
breast
and
so
eager
and
naughty
was
she
to
this
that
i
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
her
somewhat
even
as
she
had
made
to
stamp
at
me
yet
mayhaps
with
more
of
laughter
and
she
to
take
no
heed
at
all
but
to
button
the
cloak
and
be
very
sedate
yet
in
verity
i
caught
her
up
into
mine
arms
and
kissed
her
for
a
sweet
and
naughty
maid
and
she
very
willing
now
that
she
had
gotten
something
of
her
way
but
yet
in
an
hour
i
did
have
the
cloak
about
her
again
and
so
did
straiten
matters
as
you
shall
conceive
now
when
we
had
gone
forward
through
five
great
hours
i
perceived
that
the
maid
did
be
utter
worn
but
yet
did
make
presence
that
she
was
unwearied
and
because
i
saw
how
she
did
be
i
did
heed
and
be
anxious
only
that
we
come
to
some
rock
to
be
for
our
safe
refuge
and
mayhap
there
to
find
an
hole
or
cave
that
should
be
somewhat
to
keep
our
heat
about
us
for
there
was
nowhere
any
firehole
anigh
in
all
those
hours
and
presently
we
came
to
a
part
where
there
did
be
rocks
and
we
went
to
and
fro
in
the
gloom
and
came
in
the
end
to
a
place
where
the
rocks
did
go
upward
into
the
night
as
that
it
had
been
a
small
and
ancient
cliff
and
surely
in
a
while
i
found
a
hole
that
did
go
inwards
of
the
rock
and
the
hole
did
be
above
mine
head
yet
when
i
was
come
to
it
and
had
made
the
diskos
to
spin
therein
that
i
should
have
light
to
see
whether
there
did
be
any
creature
or
creeping
thing
in
the
hole
i
was
well
pleased
for
truly
it
did
be
sweet
and
dry
now
the
maid
had
cried
out
a
little
to
see
the
sudden
shining
that
did
come
from
within
the
hole
when
i
made
the
diskos
to
spin
and
because
of
the
low
roar
of
the
weapon
but
i
answered
her
that
there
did
be
naught
to
have
fear
concerning
and
so
was
she
peaceful
again
but
yet
a
little
trembling
when
that
i
came
down
to
her
for
indeed
the
diskos
did
make
always
a
strange
sounding
and
a
quaint
and
drear
shining
as
you
do
know
and
she
did
be
feared
for
me
that
some
evil
force
had
come
upon
me
out
of
the
cave
for
she
had
neither
knowledge
nor
conceiving
that
ever
there
did
be
so
wondrous
a
weapon
in
all
the
world
and
i
gave
the
maid
an
help
upward
to
the
little
cave
and
came
after
myself
and
so
we
did
be
in
a
very
nice
and
cosy
place
that
did
not
be
easily
gotten
at
by
any
monstrous
thing
and
surely
i
was
utter
glad
for
such
a
place
so
that
both
should
have
safety
that
we
might
sleep
in
the
same
hours
and
in
truth
this
was
a
needful
plan
for
if
one
had
stayed
wakeful
to
keep
a
watch
for
the
other
then
had
our
sleep
taken
us
double
hours
and
this
thing
might
not
be
else
should
our
food
be
done
and
we
to
be
twice
so
long
as
need
be
ere
ever
we
did
come
unto
the
refuge
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
i
utter
wearied
and
anxious
of
the
heart
and
spirit
that
i
bring
mine
own
soon
unto
the
safety
and
glory
of
my
mighty
home
and
so
free
from
the
destruction
that
did
hang
above
our
two
souls
for
ever
in
that
land
and
the
peril
that
did
be
everywhere
save
in
the
last
redoubt
now
when
we
were
come
into
the
hole
of
the
rock
the
maid
did
slip
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
from
my
shoulders
and
she
gat
out
the
tablets
and
made
some
of
the
water
and
did
be
very
swift
and
natty
and
all
to
the
despite
of
the
gloom
that
did
be
utter
in
that
little
cave
and
we
eat
each
of
us
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
i
made
jest
with
the
maid
how
that
the
tablets
did
be
proper
for
strength
yet
very
lacking
to
fill
the
belly
though
indeed
i
named
it
otherwise
and
she
to
agree
and
did
pat
mine
arm
and
did
tell
me
how
that
she
should
cook
me
a
monstrous
tasty
and
great
meal
when
that
we
were
come
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
and
immediately
afterward
she
did
make
to
laugh
upon
me
and
to
name
me
impudently
for
so
much
thought
unto
my
feeding
and
afterward
again
to
silence
and
to
patting
my
hand
now
when
that
we
had
made
an
end
of
eating
and
drinking
i
was
very
ready
for
sleep
for
truly
it
was
six
and
twenty
great
hours
since
that
i
did
last
slumber
but
for
the
maid
it
did
be
eight
and
thirty
great
hours
for
as
you
do
mind
she
had
made
no
sleeping
when
that
she
did
lie
in
mine
arms
for
six
hours
of
our
journeying
and
i
made
how
we
should
sleep
and
put
the
cloak
about
the
maid
but
surely
she
did
refuse
very
piteous
and
seeming
to
have
also
somewhat
of
doubt
and
puzzlement
but
in
this
thing
i
did
be
very
stern
and
intending
for
she
did
not
be
overwarm
clad
as
you
do
know
and
moreover
she
was
but
a
little
one
while
i
did
be
wondrous
hardy
and
in
verity
i
made
her
to
obey
and
gave
her
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
for
her
pillow
and
she
as
it
did
seem
to
me
to
sob
to
herself
a
little
in
the
gloom
of
the
night
but
yet
did
i
stay
my
heart
a
little
stern
to
mine
intent
and
i
wrapt
the
cloak
about
her
and
set
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
very
nice
beneath
her
head
and
afterward
i
knelt
over
to
kiss
her
before
that
i
came
unto
mine
own
slumber
yet
did
she
turn
her
mouth
from
me
and
did
put
her
hand
above
her
face
to
ward
me
off
the
which
did
grieve
me
for
truly
i
did
heed
alway
that
i
should
never
thrust
my
love
upon
her
in
her
lonesomeness
but
only
let
it
be
to
her
for
a
shield
and
for
all
comfort
unto
her
heart
and
i
turned
my
back
and
went
a
pace
away
and
lay
down
for
truly
there
did
be
no
way
else
but
to
be
near
unto
the
maid
for
it
was
but
a
little
cave
and
i
lay
very
husht
because
that
i
was
so
sore
in
the
heart
yet
truly
i
could
not
come
unto
my
slumber
for
i
was
so
disturbed
in
my
love
and
i
stayed
very
quiet
maybe
for
a
great
hour
and
did
fight
that
i
shake
not
mine
armour
to
jinglings
with
the
utter
cold
that
did
make
me
to
tremble
but
the
maid
did
sleep
very
sweet
and
calm
as
i
perceived
by
her
breathings
yet
in
verity
the
maid
did
be
so
much
awake
as
i
and
with
some
sweet
and
naughty
intent
of
the
heart
as
my
spirit
did
sudden
perceive
and
i
lay
very
husht
and
did
wait
to
discover
what
this
thing
might
be
and
i
made
my
breathing
to
seem
as
the
breathing
of
one
that
did
sleep
even
as
that
naughty
maid
did
make
pretending
and
surely
in
a
while
i
did
know
that
she
moved
very
quiet
and
came
unto
me
and
i
made
yet
that
i
slept
very
sound
and
strong
though
the
cold
did
nigh
to
conquer
all
my
quietness
and
in
a
moment
i
perceived
the
intent
of
the
maid
for
i
did
feel
the
cloak
spread
over
me
with
a
wondrous
gentleness
and
afterward
there
did
be
a
soft
kiss
put
upon
my
hand
and
the
maid
back
then
to
her
pillow
yet
as
i
did
hear
she
brought
it
something
more
nigh
to
me
as
that
she
did
crave
to
be
near
unto
me
that
was
her
own
love
and
i
sat
up
and
i
put
forth
my
hands
suddenly
and
took
the
maid
into
mine
arms
and
she
to
nestle
unto
me
so
that
i
did
be
wordless
because
that
i
loved
her
so
utter
and
presently
i
felt
her
to
stir
in
mine
arms
and
i
loost
her
somewhat
for
i
did
be
always
very
mindful
that
i
impose
not
upon
her
dear
liberty
of
maidenhood
yet
she
made
not
to
go
from
me
but
only
to
gather
the
cloak
about
her
so
that
we
did
both
be
in
the
cloak
and
she
askt
why
this
might
not
be
for
surely
it
did
be
madness
that
one
should
starve
and
the
other
be
very
nice
in
warmth
and
indeed
this
did
be
but
wisdom
yet
it
might
not
come
the
first
from
me
and
i
said
to
mine
own
that
this
thing
should
be
and
she
reached
out
and
brought
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
placed
them
for
a
pillow
for
my
head
and
told
me
that
i
should
put
my
head
thereon
and
i
askt
her
how
this
did
be
right
for
she
did
need
a
pillow
the
more
than
i
but
she
bid
me
to
bide
and
to
have
obedience
in
my
turn
and
when
i
was
so
she
spread
the
cloak
over
me
and
afterward
crept
under
and
did
lie
down
beside
me
and
did
seem
as
that
she
was
asleep
in
one
moment
yet
though
she
did
be
so
sedate
and
matterofthefact
as
we
do
say
while
that
she
was
wakeful
she
did
yet
nestle
unto
me
very
sweet
and
childlike
in
her
sleep
and
surely
i
did
want
to
kiss
her
but
yet
did
refrain
from
my
love
for
truly
i
did
well
that
i
treat
her
very
gently
at
such
a
time
as
you
do
perceive
and
in
verity
such
a
maid
doth
make
a
reverence
in
the
soul
of
a
man
now
presently
i
was
gone
over
unto
sleep
and
in
seven
hours
i
waked
and
in
that
time
had
the
maid
slumbered
through
eight
hours
yet
did
i
intend
that
she
be
not
disturbed
until
that
we
were
aready
to
the
journey
and
i
slipt
from
under
the
cloak
and
put
it
round
her
very
gentle
yet
it
to
be
as
she
did
miss
me
even
in
her
sleep
for
it
to
seem
to
me
that
she
put
out
her
arms
in
the
darkness
and
she
made
a
little
moaning
in
her
slumber
yet
in
a
moment
she
did
be
quiet
and
afterward
i
put
the
cloak
about
her
again
and
i
went
then
to
the
opening
of
the
little
cave
and
put
forth
my
head
and
lookt
well
about
and
harked
a
long
while
but
there
stirred
nothing
in
the
night
thereabout
neither
did
my
spirit
wot
of
any
matter
for
trouble
unto
us
and
presently
i
gat
out
two
of
the
tablets
for
as
you
do
know
the
maid
had
given
me
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
to
be
my
pillow
so
that
i
had
power
to
come
at
these
matters
without
awaking
her
but
for
her
own
part
as
i
did
learn
after
she
had
used
her
torn
garments
to
be
for
a
pillow
yet
had
made
no
explaining
as
you
do
mind
and
surely
this
was
one
of
her
naughty
whimsies
and
mayhap
she
had
been
so
full
of
a
playful
happinessas
doth
take
the
heart
betimesthat
she
had
made
a
little
mystery
where
there
did
be
no
mystery
and
this
but
to
release
her
joy
and
so
to
say
masterful
things
unto
me
out
of
her
impudence
and
afterward
had
meant
that
she
tell
me
but
yet
was
gone
unto
slumber
ere
that
she
did
mind
her
yet
since
that
time
a
new
thought
hath
come
unto
me
that
she
did
mean
in
the
first
that
she
should
come
into
mine
arms
to
sleep
and
thereby
need
no
pillow
but
afterward
it
may
hap
that
she
saw
with
a
sudden
olden
wisdom
all
in
one
moment
and
afterward
did
act
lovingly
yet
with
understanding
and
so
did
change
from
her
intent
yet
with
no
improperness
of
modesty
but
only
with
a
niceness
of
sense
which
she
did
make
no
talk
of
but
yet
did
have
and
surely
how
oft
is
a
man
thus
wisely
ordered
unknowing
and
to
cease
from
these
thinkings
and
to
go
forward
i
eat
two
of
the
tablets
and
afterward
made
some
of
the
water
and
lo
the
fizzing
of
the
water
waked
the
maid
and
i
knew
that
she
reached
out
very
sudden
to
me
but
afterward
knew
in
a
moment
what
did
make
the
sound
and
that
i
did
be
up
and
making
ready
for
the
journeying
and
she
gat
up
in
the
darkness
and
said
my
name
and
came
unto
me
and
kist
my
forehead
in
the
dark
and
immediately
she
ran
her
hands
gently
downward
of
my
left
arm
and
when
she
came
to
the
cup
she
took
it
from
me
and
slapt
my
hand
very
dainty
and
afterward
i
knew
that
she
took
a
sip
from
the
cup
and
then
did
turn
that
side
to
me
and
so
gave
me
to
drink
and
did
scold
me
that
i
had
not
waked
her
to
tend
to
my
needs
for
surely
she
did
be
mine
own
to
have
her
duties
to
me
and
after
that
i
had
drank
she
took
the
cup
and
did
finish
it
and
she
gat
two
of
the
tablets
as
i
did
think
and
came
afterward
and
sat
upon
the
rock
to
my
side
and
did
nestle
somewhat
against
mine
armour
and
took
mine
arm
and
set
it
about
her
and
so
did
make
to
eat
but
first
she
put
her
tablet
unto
my
lips
in
the
dark
that
i
should
kiss
it
and
surely
this
was
an
olden
way
of
mirdath
my
beautiful
one
so
that
i
did
be
all
shaken
of
the
heart
and
i
kist
the
tablet
and
immediately
she
nestled
unto
me
and
did
begin
to
eat
and
truly
it
was
as
that
eternity
had
been
rolled
backward
for
i
had
discovered
the
soul
of
mine
olden
love
in
this
dainty
maid
to
my
side
yet
in
looks
had
mirdath
been
of
an
utter
differing
but
in
verity
naani
was
wondrous
lovely
but
though
i
to
be
so
stirred
i
did
be
silent
for
my
heart
was
very
full
of
memory
and
as
the
maid
eat
she
slipt
her
fingers
between
mine
curling
them
softly
and
surely
her
fingers
did
be
very
little
and
she
stirred
mine
olden
memories
again
in
this
thing
and
surely
i
was
dumb
before
my
memory
and
presently
she
put
up
the
second
tablet
as
i
did
think
that
i
should
kiss
it
and
i
kist
it
as
before
yet
ere
she
did
begin
again
to
eat
i
did
wot
suddenly
that
she
hid
some
intent
from
me
and
i
caught
her
hand
very
quick
in
the
dark
and
her
fingers
did
close
upon
the
tablet
very
guilty
so
that
i
perceived
that
i
had
guessed
aright
and
i
opened
her
fingers
and
i
found
that
there
did
be
but
the
half
of
a
tablet
within
her
hand
and
surely
she
had
taken
but
that
one
tablet
and
had
given
me
the
one
end
to
kiss
and
afterward
the
other
so
that
i
should
suppose
she
did
eat
two
proper
and
complete
tablets
and
i
perceived
that
she
had
done
this
thing
secretly
being
minded
that
if
she
eat
always
but
one
tablet
then
should
i
never
lack
even
if
that
we
did
be
overlong
coming
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
and
i
askt
how
oft
already
had
she
eat
but
one
for
two
and
she
confessed
in
a
very
quiet
voice
that
this
did
make
the
fifth
time
and
i
was
so
angered
that
i
took
her
hand
and
whipt
it
thrice
so
hard
that
she
had
screamed
if
that
she
had
been
any
coward
and
she
said
nothing
to
me
neither
went
away
and
she
began
again
to
eat
the
half
of
the
tablet
and
did
eat
it
from
the
other
hand
as
i
to
be
aware
because
that
her
left
hand
did
be
hurt
and
she
wept
not
but
was
very
quiet
by
me
and
presently
i
knew
that
she
kist
the
whipt
hand
secretly
in
the
dark
and
afterward
i
put
mine
arm
again
about
her
and
she
did
be
there
in
it
very
sober
and
happy
and
when
she
had
made
an
end
of
the
first
tablet
i
gave
her
the
second
and
she
eat
it
very
quiet
and
content
and
presently
i
talked
with
her
and
showed
her
how
that
this
thing
did
hurt
my
heart
even
as
she
had
been
hurt
that
i
did
be
cold
garmented
the
while
that
she
did
be
warm
and
i
showed
her
the
wickedness
that
she
had
done
that
she
did
play
so
foolish
with
her
life
and
strength
and
well
might
she
be
weak
and
all
alack
yet
did
i
think
a
little
sweet
impudence
came
into
her
as
i
told
her
concerning
her
wickednesses
and
i
took
her
then
into
mine
arms
and
i
showed
her
how
that
i
knew
all
the
unselfishness
and
wonder
of
her
heart
and
i
kist
her
and
truly
her
lips
did
have
a
lovely
glad
humbleness
as
they
came
unto
mine
so
that
it
was
as
that
i
had
not
kist
her
truly
until
that
moment
and
i
made
her
to
promise
that
she
never
deceive
me
in
such
matter
again
and
indeed
she
promised
but
yet
with
no
ready
tongue
and
afterward
we
made
proper
for
the
journey
and
when
we
had
gotten
our
gear
together
i
went
downward
of
the
rock
and
gave
the
maid
help
to
come
down
and
when
we
did
stand
at
last
upon
the
bottom
of
the
rock
i
askt
naani
how
she
did
feel
and
whether
her
feet
did
hurt
and
she
answered
that
she
did
be
very
well
and
had
no
soreness
in
her
feet
and
we
went
forward
then
and
she
close
unto
me
and
odd
whiles
with
low
speech
but
more
oft
with
silence
because
that
we
did
need
that
we
hark
alway
for
any
danger
or
horror
and
also
there
did
be
so
utter
a
silence
upon
that
part
of
the
land
which
did
be
the
bottom
of
the
olden
sea
and
we
eat
and
drank
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
and
in
the
fifteenth
hour
we
came
upon
a
great
slope
of
the
earth
and
lo
it
did
be
the
far
side
of
the
sea
and
we
went
upward
for
a
long
hour
and
so
came
to
the
upward
part
and
did
be
able
once
more
to
look
over
the
greatness
of
that
land
xi
the
homeward
way
now
truly
it
did
seem
very
light
after
the
horrid
and
lonesome
gloom
that
did
lie
allways
in
the
bottom
of
the
olden
sea
and
i
saw
that
i
was
come
out
upon
a
part
of
the
land
that
did
be
surely
to
the
right
of
that
place
where
i
made
entry
into
the
seabed
on
mine
outward
going
and
there
did
be
a
great
plenty
of
fireholes
so
that
mine
heart
was
warmed
to
see
them
yet
did
i
mind
to
be
wary
in
coming
unto
them
for
as
you
do
know
there
did
so
oft
be
life
of
this
kind
and
that
about
these
fires
and
i
lookt
now
down
to
the
maid
and
she
upward
to
me
and
did
come
more
anigh
to
me
and
truly
she
did
be
most
wondrous
pretty
and
sweet
yet
did
seem
very
awearied
and
pale
in
the
face
so
that
i
made
blame
upon
myself
that
i
had
overwalked
her
for
in
verity
i
do
think
that
i
was
so
strong
and
hard
as
that
i
had
been
made
from
iron
and
she
but
a
dear
and
tender
maid
yet
did
she
refuse
that
i
should
so
reproach
myself
and
did
but
stand
anigh
to
me
and
look
at
me
with
eyes
that
were
very
beautiful
and
so
i
put
mine
arms
about
her
and
kist
her
and
afterward
lookt
again
over
the
land
that
i
should
shape
out
our
further
journeying
and
from
that
place
where
i
did
stand
there
spread
out
all
before
me
the
blue
shining
that
i
had
seen
from
the
mouthpart
of
the
upward
gorge
yet
did
it
be
a
great
way
off
and
indeed
i
should
tell
you
in
this
place
that
it
was
by
the
glimmering
of
this
shine
within
the
sky
of
the
night
that
i
had
steered
as
we
did
come
across
the
olden
seabed
and
truly
it
was
but
a
broad
thing
to
go
toward
but
yet
did
serve
me
in
that
it
told
me
that
i
went
toward
the
far
side
of
the
seabed
and
made
not
to
go
all
about
in
blind
circles
in
the
night
and
after
that
i
had
considered
a
while
i
did
know
somewhat
where
the
gorge
should
be
and
perceived
that
i
should
go
unto
my
left
but
not
overmuch
for
indeed
i
saw
the
redshining
of
the
giants
hole
that
lay
at
a
great
space
that
way
and
surely
i
must
go
so
that
i
missed
the
place
of
the
giants
so
much
as
i
might
and
in
the
same
going
come
not
overnear
unto
the
blueshining
that
lay
before
me
across
all
the
far
part
of
that
country
for
in
verity
i
mistrusted
the
place
where
that
shining
did
be
now
when
i
had
gained
somewhat
of
knowledge
where
should
be
found
the
mouth
of
the
upward
gorge
i
put
mine
arm
about
the
maid
where
she
did
stand
so
nigh
to
me
and
very
husht
the
while
that
i
had
lookt
about
and
i
pointed
outward
over
the
dark
land
unto
my
left
and
told
her
that
the
gorge
did
be
somewhere
that
way
a
great
distance
off
yet
utter
out
of
my
sight
and
only
to
be
known
that
it
did
be
somewise
there
by
the
things
that
i
did
mind
of
concerning
my
way
after
i
came
into
the
land
now
the
maid
having
stood
very
quiet
had
lookt
all
that
time
about
her
and
so
had
come
to
some
knowing
of
the
place
where
she
did
be
in
the
land
for
she
to
know
the
land
someways
as
you
shall
think
and
she
askt
me
how
i
did
mind
to
go
and
truly
i
said
so
straight
as
we
might
but
yet
so
that
we
come
neither
too
nigh
to
the
shining
nor
to
the
great
red
firepit
of
the
giants
and
the
maid
bade
me
to
look
in
the
way
that
i
did
mind
to
go
and
i
lookt
but
yet
there
was
nothing
save
as
they
did
seem
certain
fireholes
that
had
a
greenshining
about
them
and
she
set
out
unto
me
then
how
that
there
did
go
a
tract
of
bad
gas
in
that
part
of
the
land
that
should
be
utter
poisonous
unto
any
and
this
had
been
well
known
in
the
lesser
redoubt
by
the
reading
of
their
instruments
and
where
the
gas
did
go
there
was
there
a
greenshining
about
the
fireholes
and
she
showed
me
how
that
the
place
of
the
gas
went
a
great
way
unto
the
northwest
so
that
i
learned
now
somewhat
how
the
land
did
lie
as
we
do
say
in
these
days
and
it
was
in
all
the
northwest
that
the
great
blueshining
did
burn
and
i
askt
naani
how
they
named
this
and
she
told
me
by
no
name
save
but
the
shine
and
mine
own
made
very
earnest
to
warn
me
regarding
the
shine
and
urged
that
we
go
no
more
thatwards
than
should
be
needful
to
our
livesthe
which
indeed
was
no
wish
of
mine
and
her
reason
to
be
that
the
fixed
giants
did
be
within
the
borders
of
the
shine
and
all
hid
in
the
light
thereof
save
when
the
burning
mist
did
roll
this
way
or
that
and
i
took
a
great
heed
of
this
thing
and
did
guess
that
these
fixed
giants
were
somewhat
even
as
the
great
watchers
that
were
about
the
mighty
pyramid
as
you
do
know
and
immediately
i
minded
me
of
that
utter
monstrous
face
that
i
did
see
amid
the
bright
smoke
of
the
shine
when
that
i
came
first
into
the
land
and
surely
this
had
been
one
of
the
fixed
giants
that
naani
told
me
were
forces
of
great
and
very
horrid
evil
and
i
askt
mine
own
how
far
the
place
of
the
gas
went
across
the
land
and
she
pointed
and
made
further
explaining
and
in
verity
in
the
end
i
saw
not
how
i
should
come
that
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
if
that
i
would
keep
offwards
from
the
shine
yet
in
a
moment
naani
askt
me
how
i
did
come
across
the
land
when
that
i
searched
for
her
and
truly
as
i
showed
her
i
had
walked
then
by
a
sweet
chance
or
guiding
alway
upon
the
far
side
of
the
place
of
the
gas
and
so
unto
the
olden
sea
bed
and
was
in
this
way
come
free
of
the
gas
and
all
unknowing
of
it
and
at
this
telling
the
maid
said
that
we
go
downward
again
into
the
bed
of
the
olden
sea
and
walk
some
great
hours
below
the
shore
but
in
the
way
that
should
take
us
unto
the
southwest
and
so
until
we
were
come
beyond
the
place
of
the
gas
and
afterward
up
again
into
the
land
and
then
to
have
an
utter
caution
that
we
escape
the
watching
of
the
giants
who
did
be
ever
about
the
great
red
firehole
and
by
this
plan
very
speedy
to
the
enteringpart
of
the
upward
gorge
and
truly
this
did
be
very
good
and
sound
and
such
as
i
should
have
planned
in
a
moment
for
indeed
i
am
not
overslow
in
such
matters
only
the
maid
did
be
very
eager
and
quick
and
it
was
very
sweet
to
me
that
she
should
thus
plan
for
in
verity
i
loved
alway
the
sounding
of
her
voice
and
to
hear
her
have
speech
and
to
plan
and
think
and
so
to
show
me
the
workings
of
her
inward
self
and
her
dear
qualities
and
human
niceness
and
to
have
part
and
lot
alway
with
me
in
all
things
and
thinkings
and
we
shaped
to
this
plan
that
naani
made
but
at
that
time
as
you
do
mind
it
was
somewhat
of
seventeen
hours
since
last
we
had
slumber
and
the
maid
was
sore
wearied
as
i
did
see
and
i
showed
to
her
how
that
it
did
be
wise
that
we
have
our
rest
very
soon
and
so
forward
again
in
new
strength
and
ability
and
the
maid
did
soon
agree
with
me
for
indeed
she
was
very
weary
and
we
made
it
that
we
should
venture
unto
one
of
the
fireholes
that
lay
no
great
seeming
away
a
little
upon
our
right
which
was
the
northwardway
of
that
land
and
we
went
toward
the
firehole
and
truly
it
did
be
further
off
than
we
had
thought
for
it
was
a
good
hour
before
that
we
came
anigh
to
it
and
indeed
it
to
prove
a
very
great
and
redglowing
shine
that
went
upward
into
the
night
out
of
the
hollow
place
where
it
did
burn
among
rocks
and
when
we
were
come
near
unto
it
i
made
a
sign
to
the
maid
that
she
be
utter
husht
and
i
took
the
diskos
from
mine
hip
and
went
forward
before
her
and
afterward
to
my
knees
and
hands
and
beckoned
backward
to
mine
own
that
she
do
likewise
and
we
came
this
way
to
the
edge
of
the
hollowplace
where
the
firehole
did
burn
and
so
were
able
in
the
end
to
look
downward
and
truly
it
was
a
great
fire
that
burned
in
the
earth
in
that
place
yet
as
i
perceived
very
swift
there
did
seem
nowhere
any
monstrous
thing
about
the
fire
the
which
set
some
peace
upon
mine
heart
but
yet
not
overmuch
for
it
was
come
fresh
upon
me
that
we
did
well
to
stay
afar
off
from
the
fires
of
the
land
in
that
it
was
about
the
fires
that
all
living
things
did
congregate
and
i
lookt
a
great
time
and
the
maid
crept
unto
mine
elbow
and
lookt
with
me
and
afterward
we
harked
very
keen
into
the
night
but
there
was
nowhere
any
trouble
of
the
air
or
of
the
aether
of
the
land
yet
i
spoke
quiet
with
the
maid
and
showed
unto
her
how
that
we
did
well
to
stay
offward
from
the
fires
but
truly
she
was
so
utter
cold
and
chill
that
she
did
beg
that
we
go
down
by
the
firehole
even
should
it
be
that
we
stay
no
more
there
than
should
put
a
warmth
through
the
utter
chill
of
our
bodies
and
in
verity
i
was
so
bitter
cold
that
i
was
all
weak
to
go
beside
the
fire
yet
truly
i
do
think
that
the
shiverings
of
the
maid
was
that
which
did
force
my
heart
to
go
against
the
teachings
of
my
head
so
that
in
the
end
we
came
down
into
the
hollow
and
very
swift
unto
the
fire
now
truly
it
doth
seem
a
strange
thing
to
be
so
diverseminded
as
this
when
that
as
you
do
know
i
had
been
so
long
asearch
for
a
firepit
and
mayhaps
you
shall
perceive
the
better
how
my
heart
and
brain
did
be
contrary
when
that
i
tell
to
you
now
how
that
i
have
belief
that
my
spirit
did
even
then
be
subtly
set
to
warn
me
and
also
as
all
do
know
it
doth
be
easy
to
forget
this
warning
and
that
of
experience
by
which
saying
i
do
mean
that
oft
as
i
had
come
to
know
the
dangers
that
did
be
alway
about
the
fireholes
yet
when
i
did
be
far
off
from
them
and
mine
own
broken
and
ashiver
with
the
chill
of
the
land
the
danger
did
seem
but
a
small
thing
and
afar
off
from
my
mind
and
unreal
but
the
cold
to
be
doubly
real
yet
when
we
did
come
even
unto
the
firehole
then
did
come
again
all
about
my
heart
the
truth
of
those
dangers
that
had
seemed
but
a
while
gone
so
little
and
indeed
i
do
hope
you
perceive
me
in
this
thing
and
how
that
i
strive
alway
to
set
unto
you
the
utter
truth
so
that
you
shall
go
with
me
all
the
way
and
lend
me
your
nice
understanding
now
when
we
were
come
down
unto
the
firepit
i
went
this
way
and
that
among
the
rocks
that
did
be
in
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
so
that
i
should
perceive
whether
there
did
be
any
living
creature
there
hid
that
should
mayhap
come
out
unknown
to
work
us
harm
but
indeed
i
discovered
nothing
of
any
greatness
yet
i
saw
three
snakes
and
there
were
beside
two
scorpioncreatures
as
i
did
name
them
that
neither
went
backward
from
me
nor
came
against
me
but
did
bide
where
i
saw
them
each
in
an
hole
of
the
rock
and
because
i
had
seen
these
things
i
saw
that
we
should
not
do
wise
to
sleep
nigh
unto
the
firehole
for
the
creeping
things
did
mortally
like
the
heat
and
should
be
like
to
come
upon
us
in
our
slumber
and
indeed
this
did
but
uphold
my
caution
that
we
should
be
well
actioned
if
that
we
chose
some
other
part
to
our
rest
yet
as
you
shall
suppose
i
said
naught
unto
the
maid
concerning
the
creeping
and
the
poisonous
things
for
i
did
mean
that
she
have
rest
and
happiness
the
while
that
we
did
stay
beside
the
firehole
and
afterward
i
should
tell
her
and
so
she
be
the
more
ready
to
see
the
properness
that
we
go
elsewhere
to
our
sleep
but
as
you
to
understand
if
that
she
not
to
see
wisely
and
be
still
intent
to
the
firehole
i
should
have
her
to
obey
for
surely
she
was
mine
own
and
i
did
love
her
and
did
mean
alway
to
have
her
to
safety
now
presently
the
maid
was
something
warmed
and
afterward
she
slipt
the
scrip
from
my
shoulder
and
so
had
food
and
drink
very
swift
to
my
need
and
we
sat
together
and
eat
and
drank
and
the
maid
very
sweet
and
quiet
as
she
did
begin
to
eat
her
second
tablet
and
truly
i
had
knowing
that
she
did
remember
in
all
her
body
that
i
had
whipt
her
and
indeed
she
did
be
utter
mine
and
oft
as
we
did
eat
and
drink
i
lookt
this
way
and
that
so
that
no
creeping
thing
should
come
anigh
to
us
and
presently
when
we
had
made
an
end
of
our
food
the
maid
saw
that
i
did
look
about
and
she
then
very
swift
to
catch
some
of
mine
unease
and
to
stare
over
her
shoulder
and
indeed
in
a
little
while
she
saw
a
snake
go
among
the
rocks
and
she
then
to
be
very
eager
that
we
find
some
place
that
should
be
secure
from
creeping
things
and
we
to
begin
then
to
look
for
such
but
in
the
end
we
stayed
in
the
hollow
for
we
found
a
little
cave
that
did
be
in
an
upstanding
rock
of
the
hollow
and
the
upstanding
rock
was
mayhaps
an
hundred
good
feet
off
from
the
fire
for
the
hollow
was
very
great
and
the
cave
did
be
a
hole
that
was
thrice
my
height
up
from
the
bottom
rocks
and
it
was
dry
and
sweet
and
with
no
creeping
thing
within
it
neither
did
there
be
any
place
to
hide
such
therein
and
when
we
were
gotten
into
the
hole
surely
it
did
be
very
sweet
and
cozy
for
the
shine
of
the
firehole
did
shine
therein
and
surely
we
had
felt
it
a
very
haven
but
that
there
was
ever
the
fear
of
the
land
upon
our
hearts
and
upon
mine
the
more
than
upon
the
maid
for
truly
mine
own
did
seem
to
trust
me
utter
and
to
seem
that
she
feared
not
any
evil
monster
but
to
have
surety
that
i
had
power
to
succour
her
in
all
ways
and
truly
this
trust
had
been
very
sweet
unto
my
heart
if
that
i
had
lacked
somewhat
of
my
terror
for
the
safe
homegoing
of
mine
own
and
we
slept
that
night
as
we
had
done
before
and
shared
the
cloak
over
us
for
truly
the
firehole
made
no
great
warmth
unto
us
yet
was
it
less
bitter
in
that
part
than
in
the
darkness
of
the
land
and
by
that
we
had
come
unto
sleep
it
was
twenty
good
hours
since
last
we
had
slumber
and
truly
we
did
be
very
wearied
but
yet
came
unto
our
rest
with
our
spirits
set
anxious
to
harken
on
danger
the
while
that
we
did
sleep
and
we
slept
seven
hours
and
did
know
suddenly
of
some
matter
that
had
need
to
waken
us
and
lo
in
a
moment
i
did
wake
and
the
maid
in
the
same
instant
of
time
and
there
was
a
great
screaming
and
crying
out
in
the
night
that
surely
affrighted
us
both
yet
did
hurt
our
hearts
the
more
for
it
did
be
the
utter
cryings
and
terror
of
poor
humans
in
the
night
of
that
land
yet
might
i
do
naught
but
only
wait
that
i
learn
more
of
the
matter
for
my
duty
was
unto
mine
own
and
i
had
no
leave
of
rashness
any
more
yet
as
you
do
suppose
i
was
all
shaken
to
go
downward
of
the
rock
and
afterward
to
climb
out
from
the
hollow
that
i
should
give
some
help
unto
they
that
did
need
help
but
yet
might
i
not
leave
the
maid
and
immediately
there
was
a
great
roaring
in
one
part
of
the
night
and
again
another
roaring
in
another
part
of
the
night
and
lo
in
a
moment
the
roarings
did
be
answered
and
the
roarings
were
the
sounds
of
big
and
husky
voices
so
that
it
did
seem
that
we
harked
to
men
so
big
as
houses
that
did
run
and
shout
in
the
night
and
the
maid
did
begin
to
shake
and
i
put
mine
arm
about
her
and
drew
her
backward
into
the
hole
so
that
she
did
be
into
the
shadow
and
she
to
tremble
like
one
that
was
broken
in
courage
for
truly
she
had
heard
those
sounds
oft
in
the
night
in
all
the
long
and
dreadful
month
that
she
had
wandered
and
indeed
i
was
all
shaken
in
my
courage
for
it
did
be
the
shouting
of
giants
that
i
heard
and
you
do
know
somewhat
of
the
utter
horror
and
terror
that
did
be
alway
in
the
heart
that
did
harken
unto
those
monstrous
voices
for
you
do
know
my
tale
and
there
came
in
a
moment
a
dreadful
screaming
out
in
the
night
and
the
screaming
did
be
the
screaming
of
a
young
maid
that
doth
be
slain
very
brutal
and
my
heart
sickened
because
of
mine
own
but
my
spirit
did
swell
with
a
strange
and
utter
anger
as
that
it
should
burst
my
body
and
the
maid
to
my
side
broke
into
an
utter
sobbing
and
the
screaming
of
the
maid
afar
off
in
the
dark
did
end
very
sudden
but
in
a
moment
there
did
be
other
screamings
in
diverse
places
and
the
hoarse
shoutings
of
the
great
men
and
the
thudding
of
mighty
feet
that
ran
this
way
and
that
achase
and
the
cryings
of
the
humans
came
nearer
and
the
thuddings
of
the
great
feet
and
in
verity
in
a
little
minute
it
did
seem
unto
me
that
the
sounds
did
be
right
upon
the
hollow
and
i
crept
forward
and
peered
out
and
i
felt
the
night
to
be
full
of
people
running
and
immediately
there
passed
by
the
hollow
a
clustering
of
humans
that
ran
ever
and
screamed
and
gasped
and
wept
panting
as
they
ran
and
the
shining
of
the
firehole
made
them
plain
seen
and
clear
and
they
did
be
both
men
and
women
and
were
but
in
rags
or
utter
naked
and
all
torn
by
the
rocks
and
the
bushes
and
did
seem
indeed
as
that
they
had
been
wild
things
that
did
go
by
so
swift
and
lost
and
mine
heart
troubled
me
with
the
pain
and
longing
that
it
did
know
so
that
i
had
gone
in
a
moment
after
those
people
but
that
i
should
leave
mine
own
and
put
her
to
peril
and
even
while
that
i
felt
so
utter
in
this
thing
there
came
a
great
thudding
of
monstrous
feet
and
there
ran
four
great
men
out
of
the
night
and
went
past
the
hollow
very
quick
and
three
did
be
dull
coloured
and
seeming
much
haired
and
brutish
but
the
other
did
be
an
horrid
white
and
lividblotched
so
that
it
did
seem
to
my
spirit
that
there
went
by
a
thing
that
did
be
a
very
manmonster
filled
of
unwholesome
life
and
surely
they
did
be
gone
from
out
of
the
shine
of
the
fire
in
one
moment
as
we
do
say
and
again
into
the
night
to
their
dreadful
chasing
and
when
the
thudding
of
their
feet
had
gone
a
long
way
off
over
the
land
i
heard
them
bellowing
and
afterward
a
far
away
screaming
that
did
have
a
death
note
in
it
and
i
knew
that
those
dreadful
brutemen
did
be
taking
the
life
from
some
poor
wild
humans
and
afterward
there
did
be
the
silence
again
and
surely
it
did
come
to
me
with
a
fierce
impatience
of
sorrow
that
those
people
did
be
without
spirit
of
courage
else
had
they
turned
them
upon
the
giants
and
slain
them
with
their
hands
even
if
that
all
had
died
to
compass
that
slaying
for
truly
they
should
all
die
anywise
by
the
giantmen
and
they
had
died
then
with
somewhat
to
comfort
their
hate
yet
as
i
do
know
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
had
long
been
born
of
parents
that
were
starved
of
the
earthcurrent
through
an
hundredthousand
years
and
more
and
because
of
this
thing
they
did
surely
lack
somewhat
in
all
ways
yet
was
naani
otherwise
but
this
not
to
prove
aught
save
the
rule
as
we
do
say
now
sudden
as
i
stooped
very
husht
and
troubled
in
the
mouth
of
the
little
cave
i
knew
that
mine
own
sobbed
dryly
in
the
back
part
of
the
cave
and
i
had
gone
to
comfort
her
but
that
in
the
same
moment
i
saw
a
naked
maid
run
very
swift
over
the
edge
of
the
hollow
and
did
look
over
her
shoulder
as
she
ran
and
she
came
to
the
bottom
and
crept
in
under
a
ledge
of
rock
that
did
be
in
that
place
and
she
did
seem
utter
worn
and
gone
of
the
spirit
and
desperate
and
i
perceived
in
the
same
instant
why
that
she
did
go
stealthy
and
swift
in
that
fashion
and
to
cower
as
for
her
very
life
for
there
came
a
squat
haired
man
so
broad
as
a
bullock
who
did
come
silent
down
into
the
hollow
looking
this
way
and
that
even
as
a
wild
beast
doth
peer
very
sudden
and
the
squat
man
had
instant
knowing
of
the
place
where
the
maid
did
be
and
ran
in
upon
her
with
no
sound
and
i
paused
not
but
leaped
all
the
great
way
unto
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
which
did
be
mayhaps
twenty
good
feet
and
more
for
mine
anger
was
upon
me
and
i
did
mean
that
i
save
that
one
though
i
did
be
powerless
to
give
succour
unto
those
others
and
i
fell
strong
upon
my
feet
and
had
no
harm
of
my
limbs
for
all
that
the
leap
did
be
so
high
and
in
that
moment
before
that
i
had
time
to
save
the
maid
the
squat
man
ript
her
and
she
cried
out
once
with
a
very
dreadful
scream
and
was
suddenly
dead
in
the
hands
of
the
bruteman
and
my
heart
made
my
blood
to
burn
with
wrath
in
mine
eyes
so
that
i
had
scarce
power
in
that
instant
to
see
the
squat
man
as
i
ran
upon
him
and
the
roar
of
the
diskos
filled
all
the
hollow
as
i
made
it
to
spin
as
that
it
did
rage
with
an
anger
and
to
be
glut
of
the
man
and
the
man
came
round
upon
me
and
thought
mayhaps
to
deal
with
me
as
it
had
dealt
with
that
poor
maid
but
not
all
thatwise
as
you
must
know
and
i
swung
the
diskos
and
it
did
seem
to
sing
and
to
cry
eager
in
my
hands
and
i
smote
at
the
squat
man
even
as
it
did
leap
silent
upon
me
as
a
tiger
doth
leap
making
no
sound
but
i
gat
not
home
the
blow
for
the
man
dropt
sudden
down
upon
the
hands
and
the
blow
went
overwards
and
the
bruteman
caught
me
by
the
legs
to
rip
me
and
i
cut
quick
with
the
diskos
and
it
did
have
but
one
monstrous
talon
left
unto
it
and
immediately
it
cast
me
with
the
other
half
across
the
hollow
and
i
fell
with
mine
armour
clanging
mightily
and
the
diskos
did
ring
like
a
bell
and
by
the
graciousness
of
all
good
things
i
was
harmed
not
by
that
monster
throw
but
was
to
my
feet
in
one
instant
and
had
not
loosed
the
diskos
from
my
hand
and
the
beastman
did
be
upon
me
with
two
quick
boundings
and
i
stood
up
to
the
man
and
it
made
no
sound
or
cry
as
it
came
at
me
and
there
did
a
great
froth
of
brute
anger
and
intent
come
from
the
mouth
of
it
and
the
teeth
came
down
on
each
side
of
the
mouth
very
great
and
sharp
and
i
leaped
and
smote
so
that
my
blow
should
come
the
more
speedy
and
the
diskos
took
away
the
head
and
the
shoulder
of
the
squat
man
and
the
dead
thing
knockt
me
backward
with
the
spring
that
it
had
made
but
it
harmed
me
not
greatly
yet
afterward
i
did
know
how
sore
and
bruised
i
did
be
in
all
my
body
and
being
and
i
came
back
very
swift
against
the
man
but
it
did
be
truly
dead
and
greatly
horrid
and
i
went
from
the
dead
monster
and
did
go
all
heartshaken
unto
the
dead
maid
and
i
took
the
torn
body
of
the
maid
very
sorrowful
and
cast
it
into
the
firehole
and
i
turned
me
then
that
i
should
look
unto
the
cave
that
i
should
know
that
all
did
be
well
with
mine
own
and
whether
she
did
have
seen
the
horror
or
be
gone
into
a
swoon
and
lo
mine
own
did
run
toward
me
and
she
had
in
her
hand
my
beltknife
which
i
did
give
her
before
that
time
to
be
a
weapon
for
her
defence
and
i
perceived
that
she
had
come
to
be
mine
aid
if
that
i
did
need
such
and
she
did
be
utter
pale
yet
very
steadfast
and
not
seeming
to
tremble
and
i
made
to
take
her
from
that
place
but
she
went
beyond
me
and
lookt
at
the
monstrous
bulk
of
the
squat
man
and
was
very
silent
and
she
came
back
unto
me
and
still
so
silent
and
she
stood
before
me
and
said
no
word
but
my
heart
knew
what
she
did
be
thinking
for
i
am
not
foolish
to
have
lacked
to
know
what
did
be
in
her
heart
though
mine
effort
had
not
shown
itself
that
way
unto
me
before
that
moment
and
i
had
no
pretending
of
modesty
but
received
with
gladness
and
a
strangeness
of
humbleness
the
honour
that
her
eyes
did
give
to
me
for
indeed
she
did
be
so
that
she
might
not
give
word
to
her
joy
of
me
and
her
glad
respecting
the
which
is
so
wondrous
good
unto
the
heart
of
all
men
that
do
be
loving
of
a
dear
and
honest
maid
and
she
said
nothing
neither
then
nor
afterward
but
i
did
be
honoured
all
my
life
after
when
that
i
did
anytime
mind
me
of
the
way
that
mine
own
lookt
upward
at
me
in
those
moments
and
afterward
she
did
need
and
allow
herself
to
come
unto
mine
arms
that
i
hold
her
from
the
trembling
of
heart
which
did
come
to
her
after
that
there
did
be
no
need
for
courage
for
surely
we
had
both
seen
a
very
dreadful
thing
and
there
was
a
great
horror
upon
us
and
i
climbed
upward
again
to
the
little
cave
and
did
help
naani
and
when
we
were
come
there
again
we
did
rest
awhile
and
presently
we
eat
each
of
us
two
of
the
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
indeed
we
were
both
utter
thirsty
and
in
about
an
hour
after
that
we
had
harked
very
keen
a
time
we
came
downward
again
from
the
cave
and
had
our
gear
with
us
and
we
came
up
out
of
the
hollow
and
set
forward
with
a
great
caution
unto
the
olden
seabed
and
we
came
there
in
two
long
hours
for
we
went
very
slow
and
with
constant
harkings
for
the
fear
of
the
monstrous
men
was
upon
us
but
there
came
no
harm
anigh
neither
did
we
perceive
any
disturbance
in
the
night
of
the
land
and
we
went
down
an
hour
into
the
olden
seabed
and
did
go
now
the
more
swift
for
our
fear
was
something
eased
from
us
because
that
we
had
come
away
from
that
place
where
we
had
perceived
so
great
and
dread
an
hunting
but
yet
had
we
all
care
about
us
for
the
giants
surely
to
be
everywhere
in
that
land
but
yet
as
i
do
think
they
to
roam
more
oft
anigh
to
the
fireholes
for
the
humans
did
surely
wander
in
such
parts
that
they
have
warmth
of
the
fires
and
after
we
had
gone
downward
an
hour
into
the
seabed
we
turned
somewhat
unto
the
southwest
and
went
for
twelve
great
hours
and
did
never
be
any
huge
space
from
the
shore
for
it
did
run
that
way
as
you
do
know
and
i
made
to
steer
by
the
shinings
of
the
land
and
with
advices
from
mine
own
and
in
the
end
of
the
twelfth
hour
i
did
count
our
distance
making
that
we
did
walk
somewhat
of
a
certain
speed
and
by
the
tellings
of
the
maid
we
did
be
surely
come
beyond
the
place
of
the
land
where
the
poison
gas
did
lie
and
by
this
it
did
be
something
after
seventeen
hours
since
we
did
sleep
and
surely
we
did
be
very
ready
to
have
rest
for
we
had
gone
forward
strongly
and
with
anxiousness
and
truly
my
hurts
did
be
come
upon
me
so
that
my
whole
body
did
ache
for
the
quick
fight
had
been
bitter
and
i
had
been
thrown
very
hard
and
brutal
and
indeed
it
was
wondrous
that
i
had
not
been
all
smashed
only
that
the
armour
did
save
me
and
this
doth
show
truly
how
hard
and
strong
i
did
be
and
naani
did
speak
upon
this
and
was
oft
awonder
and
at
that
time
did
beg
me
that
i
make
some
rest
to
cure
my
hurts
for
she
had
not
conceived
that
a
man
did
grow
so
strong
and
hardy
and
in
verity
the
men
of
the
lesser
redoubt
did
be
softmade
and
lacking
of
grimness
as
i
did
perceive
both
through
my
reason
and
from
her
tellings
for
they
did
lack
the
strong
life
that
doth
breed
where
is
the
beat
of
the
earthcurrent
as
we
to
have
in
the
mighty
pyramid
and
this
thing
i
have
said
somewise
before
this
time
and
because
that
we
did
be
so
wearied
i
said
unto
naani
that
we
find
a
place
for
our
slumber
and
she
very
willing
as
i
have
shown
and
to
counsel
me
likewise
yet
did
we
search
about
in
that
gloom
for
a
great
hour
more
and
found
no
cave
or
hole
to
give
us
a
safe
refuge
for
our
sleep
and
when
that
we
could
not
find
such
i
told
naani
that
we
should
put
the
boulders
together
somewhat
and
so
have
them
about
us
that
we
be
greatly
hid
and
in
truth
even
as
i
began
to
tell
her
my
plan
she
did
have
the
same
words
in
her
mouth
so
that
we
caught
our
little
fingers
there
in
the
dark
of
that
grim
land
in
the
end
of
the
world
even
as
she
and
i
had
done
oft
in
the
early
years
before
that
eternity
when
that
she
did
be
mirdath
the
beautiful
and
we
did
both
be
silent
and
after
that
we
had
wished
very
solemn
and
earnest
we
said
each
a
name
even
as
lad
and
maid
shall
do
in
this
age
and
so
to
laughter
and
kist
one
the
other
and
truly
the
world
doth
seem
not
to
alter
in
the
heart
as
you
shall
think
and
this
was
what
i
did
find
and
we
setto
and
gathered
together
the
boulders
which
did
be
very
plentiful
in
that
part
and
she
carry
those
that
did
be
thin
and
flat
and
i
to
roll
those
that
did
be
great
and
round
and
i
made
a
place
that
did
be
long
and
narrow
and
afterward
i
set
the
flat
stones
round
the
sides
that
there
be
no
little
hole
by
which
any
creeping
thing
should
come
inward
to
sting
us
in
our
sleep
and
afterward
we
gat
inside
and
surely
it
did
be
very
cozy
as
we
do
say
but
yet
not
so
secure
as
i
did
wish
only
that
i
could
not
shift
to
plan
aught
better
and
indeed
it
should
keep
off
from
us
any
small
thing
and
should
be
like
to
save
us
from
any
monstrous
brute
treading
upon
us
but
otherwise
it
did
be
but
a
poor
affair
now
we
eat
two
of
the
tablets
each
and
drank
some
of
the
water
even
as
we
had
done
in
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
and
afterward
we
shared
the
cloak
for
our
slumber
and
we
kist
very
sedate
and
loving
and
charged
our
spirits
that
we
wake
if
that
any
horrid
thing
should
come
anigh
to
us
in
our
sleep
and
afterward
we
did
be
gone
very
swift
to
slumbering
and
suffered
no
harm
and
i
waked
seven
hours
after
and
surely
i
did
ache
very
bitter
as
i
did
move
my
body
for
the
bruisings
did
be
gotten
hold
of
me
and
i
slipt
away
from
the
maid
very
gentle
for
i
had
mind
that
she
sleep
a
while
more
as
i
did
mean
that
we
make
a
great
journey
that
day
and
after
i
had
harked
a
while
and
perceived
that
there
was
no
evil
thing
anigh
i
went
outward
of
the
stones
and
i
walked
to
and
fore
and
moved
mine
arms
that
i
be
eased
somewhat
of
the
stiffness
and
ache
but
surely
it
did
seem
that
many
hours
must
go
ere
i
should
make
any
speed
of
travel
for
i
did
be
all
clumsy
and
slow
and
nigh
to
groan
with
the
pain
of
going
and
aught
that
i
did
and
i
minded
me
that
i
should
do
somewhat
to
ease
this
thing
lest
that
i
cause
us
both
to
come
to
an
harm
by
staying
overlong
in
that
land
and
i
went
back
into
the
stones
and
gat
an
ointment
from
the
pouch
that
i
did
carry
and
surely
the
maid
did
yet
sleep
and
i
went
outward
of
the
stones
again
and
stript
off
the
armour
and
all
my
garments
and
i
rubbed
my
body
with
the
ointment
and
surely
the
pain
did
be
so
that
i
groaned
at
this
time
and
that
but
yet
must
i
rub
good
and
strong
so
that
i
die
not
of
the
cold
of
the
land
and
beside
i
was
greatly
anxious
to
cure
myself
and
sudden
as
i
did
rub
very
strong
and
savage
and
heeding
so
well
as
i
might
that
i
groan
not
the
maid
did
speak
close
beside
me
and
indeed
she
could
see
me
but
dimly
and
had
waked
sudden
to
hear
my
groaning
and
i
was
not
to
her
side
and
immediately
she
had
thought
that
some
evil
thing
harmed
me
and
was
come
in
an
instant
that
she
be
with
me
and
she
cared
not
that
i
did
be
naked
but
was
utter
in
anger
that
i
strove
to
do
this
thing
alone
and
with
none
to
aid
me
and
all
uncovered
to
the
chill
of
the
land
and
she
ran
back
into
the
stones
and
brought
the
cloak
and
put
it
about
me
and
was
so
angered
that
she
stampt
and
had
no
impudence
but
rather
as
that
she
did
be
minded
to
have
tears
and
she
sent
me
back
into
the
sheltering
of
the
stones
and
gathered
mine
armour
and
brought
these
things
after
me
but
the
diskos
i
took
in
my
hand
and
she
took
the
pot
of
the
ointment
from
me
and
made
me
to
lie
and
she
rubbed
me
very
strong
and
tender
and
kept
me
warm
with
the
cloak
and
surely
she
was
a
wise
and
lovely
maid
and
utter
mine
own
and
in
the
end
she
askt
me
how
i
was
and
i
said
that
i
did
be
different
and
she
hurried
me
that
i
be
clothed
very
quick
for
she
did
be
sore
afraid
that
i
should
come
to
a
chill
and
when
i
was
gotten
again
into
mine
armour
she
came
to
me
and
showed
me
where
i
did
lack
wisdom
and
spoke
very
straitly
and
gentle
and
serious
and
afterward
kist
me
and
gave
me
my
tablets
and
to
sit
beside
me
and
we
eat
and
drank
and
i
with
a
new
lovingness
unto
mine
own
and
she
somewhat
as
that
she
did
mother
me
but
when
i
put
mine
arm
about
her
she
did
be
only
a
maid
and
we
did
be
thus
with
but
little
talk
and
a
great
content
and
afterward
we
gat
our
gear
together
and
went
from
that
little
refuge
that
we
had
made
and
in
a
while
we
did
go
upward
out
of
the
olden
seabed
and
when
we
were
come
again
to
the
top
of
the
shore
the
which
we
did
in
two
good
hours
i
lookt
over
the
land
a
time
with
mine
own
anigh
to
me
and
i
perceived
that
the
great
red
firepit
of
the
giants
did
be
no
mighty
way
off
unto
the
south
and
west
and
surely
in
a
little
moment
we
saw
that
there
went
monstrous
figures
against
the
shine
of
the
mighty
firepit
and
we
stoopt
unto
the
earth
for
it
did
seem
that
the
light
did
be
like
to
show
us
standing
there
though
truly
we
did
be
afar
off
as
you
perceive
yet
mayhaps
you
do
share
with
us
the
utter
horror
and
distress
that
those
horrid
men
did
cast
about
the
heart
and
so
have
a
kindly
understanding
of
our
fear
and
over
all
the
land
in
this
place
and
that
there
did
be
the
small
shining
of
little
fireholes
and
pits
that
did
be
alway
red
save
in
that
part
where
the
poison
gas
did
lie
the
which
we
had
now
come
safe
past
and
beyond
the
fireholes
was
the
great
shine
that
lay
from
the
west
unto
the
north
of
all
that
land
and
in
verity
we
did
need
that
we
steer
so
that
we
come
not
anigh
to
it
neither
unto
the
great
red
firepit
of
the
giants
neither
unto
the
low
volcanoes
which
were
beyond
the
great
red
firepit
as
you
do
know
and
someways
unto
the
mouth
of
the
upward
gorge
and
the
way
of
our
journey
was
between
the
west
and
the
southwest
of
that
land
and
to
be
made
with
cunning
and
wisdom
that
we
come
clear
of
all
unseemly
danger
unto
mine
own
and
i
askt
her
concerning
this
thing
and
that
of
the
land
and
surely
she
told
me
so
much
of
terror
that
i
was
half
in
a
wonder
that
ever
i
did
live
in
the
end
to
come
unto
her
and
it
was
because
of
the
things
that
she
set
out
to
me
that
i
perceived
how
we
must
come
nowise
anigh
to
the
low
volcanoes
that
were
upon
this
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
upward
gorge
for
it
had
been
known
alway
in
the
lesser
redoubt
that
there
went
very
horrid
men
in
that
part
that
did
be
called
wolfmen
but
whether
there
did
be
any
such
thing
in
that
age
she
had
no
knowing
for
she
told
me
the
things
that
did
be
set
down
in
the
records
and
the
histories
and
truly
no
man
of
the
lesser
redoubt
had
found
heart
in
a
thousand
great
years
to
make
a
journeying
through
the
land
for
the
desire
of
glad
and
dreadful
adventuring
such
as
our
young
men
did
be
oft
set
to
though
it
was
not
all
such
that
went
and
because
there
did
be
no
adventuring
for
so
monstrous
a
space
of
years
there
was
no
certain
new
knowledge
of
the
land
of
that
age
and
this
thing
is
plain
to
you
and
needing
not
of
many
words
which
do
so
irk
me
and
naani
set
out
to
me
how
that
the
shine
was
conceived
to
be
a
land
where
evil
did
live
for
ever
and
whence
came
all
those
forces
of
evil
that
did
work
upon
the
lesser
refuge
and
afterward
she
did
quiet
so
that
presently
i
perceived
that
she
did
weep
to
herself
because
that
her
memory
was
all
newstirred
by
my
questionings
and
i
took
her
very
gentle
into
mine
arms
as
we
did
be
there
kneeled
upon
the
earth
and
after
that
time
i
askt
her
no
question
save
as
it
did
be
needful
to
our
health
and
life
yet
oft
did
she
tell
me
this
thing
and
that
of
her
knowledge
to
be
for
mine
help
and
guiding
now
we
went
forward
going
a
space
toward
the
northwest
so
that
we
come
the
more
clear
of
the
place
where
did
be
the
great
red
firepit
of
the
giants
and
we
journeyed
with
a
care
alway
that
we
show
not
ourselves
overplain
unto
the
light
that
shone
over
the
land
from
the
great
pit
and
oft
we
did
creep
a
while
over
this
stark
place
and
that
and
went
nimbly
amid
the
bushes
that
grew
oft
in
great
parts
and
we
made
six
hours
this
way
and
did
then
have
pause
that
we
eat
and
drink
and
truly
it
was
nine
hours
since
first
i
did
wake
yet
had
we
made
no
pausing
because
that
we
were
so
set
to
our
journeying
to
come
clear
of
the
place
where
did
be
the
giants
and
after
that
we
had
eat
and
drunk
we
went
onward
again
and
made
now
unto
the
southwest
for
we
did
heed
that
we
go
no
more
unto
the
northwest
because
that
should
bring
us
overnear
to
the
shine
and
in
the
fourteenth
hour
of
that
days
travel
we
came
to
a
part
where
the
land
dipt
downward
into
a
broad
valley
and
surely
it
did
be
very
dark
down
there
and
did
be
seeming
shallow
yet
truly
of
a
great
deepness
but
we
went
that
way
because
that
it
did
be
a
weary
long
journey
to
go
around
the
place
where
the
valley
did
be
and
the
valley
had
a
different
darkness
from
the
gloom
that
went
alway
in
the
olden
seabed
for
the
gloom
of
the
seabed
did
be
ever
of
a
greyness
but
the
gloom
of
this
valley
had
a
greater
dark
within
it
yet
did
the
air
seem
more
clear
and
we
went
downward
three
hours
into
the
valley
and
stopt
then
that
we
eat
and
drink
and
truly
i
had
not
paused
then
but
that
mine
own
did
insist
for
our
methods
did
be
like
else
to
go
all
adrift
and
we
to
be
lacking
of
proper
strength
and
this
was
wisdom
of
the
maid
but
i
to
be
a
little
irkedlike
and
restless
and
this
mayhap
because
that
my
blood
did
itch
me
because
that
it
did
be
so
full
of
the
poison
of
my
bruises
and
it
was
gone
now
of
seventeen
hours
since
last
we
did
sleep
but
yet
did
we
be
ready
to
go
forward
that
we
come
so
quick
as
maybe
out
of
the
dark
of
that
valley
for
there
did
seem
nowheres
any
firehole
to
make
a
light
only
that
in
this
place
and
that
there
did
be
a
little
blue
shining
as
that
there
burned
a
strange
gas
in
this
part
or
that
now
in
two
hours
after
the
time
that
we
did
eat
we
stopt
both
of
us
very
sudden
for
there
did
be
some
vague
and
curious
sound
in
the
night
and
we
went
very
swift
to
the
earth
that
we
be
hid
and
harked
but
did
hear
nothing
and
in
a
while
we
to
go
onward
again
yet
there
did
be
an
unease
upon
our
spirits
for
our
spirits
did
perceive
something
afar
off
in
the
night
but
yet
had
we
no
surety
in
this
matter
and
we
went
forward
through
a
great
hour
more
and
did
pass
in
that
time
two
places
where
the
blueshining
did
be
and
truly
it
seemed
as
that
a
low
gas
hung
to
the
earth
in
this
part
and
that
and
made
a
slow
burning
having
neither
noise
nor
spurtings
but
slow
as
that
it
did
smoulder
and
be
all
to
shine
and
luminous
and
oft
there
did
be
a
strong
smelling
of
a
bitter
gas
very
horrid
in
the
throat
and
in
the
end
of
another
hour
while
that
we
were
a
space
off
from
one
of
those
gasshinings
there
went
past
us
at
a
distance
as
it
did
seem
people
running
in
the
night
as
that
they
did
be
lost
spirits
yet
with
a
rustling
very
soft
so
that
they
did
be
like
to
be
barefoot
and
i
thought
mayhap
that
these
did
be
some
of
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
pyramid
yet
did
they
be
only
as
that
shadows
went
among
the
blueshinings
and
i
pondered
a
moment
whether
that
i
send
my
voice
over
the
valley
to
question
what
they
did
be
but
yet
had
caution
and
harked
through
the
utter
silence
of
the
night
for
i
had
no
surety
of
aught
and
surely
in
that
moment
that
we
harked
very
keen
there
did
be
a
sound
afar
off
in
the
night
of
the
land
and
it
was
as
that
we
had
heard
the
sound
before
and
in
verity
our
spirits
had
perceived
the
sound
those
two
hours
back
and
now
our
bodies
did
wot
and
perceived
that
we
had
known
it
subtly
before
that
moment
and
the
sound
was
as
that
something
went
spinning
in
the
night
and
a
very
great
terror
came
upon
the
maid
for
she
did
know
the
sound
and
the
sound
was
that
which
did
show
that
one
of
the
great
evil
forces
of
the
land
did
approach
and
the
sound
had
been
known
alway
in
the
lesser
refuge
to
show
this
thing
and
indeed
mine
own
spirit
had
been
half
to
know
that
a
power
of
evil
did
come
through
the
night
but
yet
was
the
assurance
very
terrible
for
how
should
i
protect
mine
own
and
the
spinning
came
toward
us
and
was
presently
in
the
valley
and
it
came
swiftly
across
the
dark
of
the
valley
and
my
heart
was
all
broken
within
me
because
that
there
had
been
happiness
with
us
but
a
little
time
gone
and
now
there
did
be
our
death
anigh
and
mine
own
gave
me
the
knife
that
i
had
given
to
her
meaning
that
i
slay
her
in
the
last
moment
for
she
did
heed
even
in
that
moment
that
she
be
not
gashed
horridly
by
the
terror
of
the
diskos
and
i
took
the
knife
and
i
kist
not
mine
own
but
stood
there
very
shaken
and
desperate
and
gript
her
fast
unto
me
scarce
heeding
the
hardness
of
my
gripe
and
alway
i
lookt
unto
the
way
of
the
coming
of
the
sound
and
presently
did
unbare
my
wrist
where
the
capsule
did
be
and
the
sound
of
the
thing
spinning
came
anigh
across
the
valley
and
my
heart
did
dull
and
my
spirit
go
black
with
my
desperateness
because
that
this
thing
must
be
and
because
that
i
could
nowhere
see
hope
that
i
should
save
mine
own
and
of
a
sudden
the
maid
put
up
her
arms
and
pulled
me
downward
and
kist
me
once
on
the
lips
but
i
wot
not
whether
i
kist
her
for
i
did
burn
with
despair
and
was
all
adrift
in
my
being
yet
was
there
a
sharp
comfort
that
mine
own
dying
did
be
so
nigh
and
the
maid
stood
gently
against
me
so
that
she
did
be
convenient
unto
my
hand
and
afterward
i
remembered
this
thing
and
do
you
pray
that
you
be
never
to
have
such
a
matter
on
your
hearts
but
indeed
there
was
a
wonder
in
this
thing
beside
the
horror
so
that
my
memory
doth
be
alway
knowing
of
this
wonder
and
mayhap
you
do
see
with
me
and
love
mine
own
also
in
your
hearts
and
in
the
moment
that
the
maid
stood
thus
as
i
have
told
i
perceived
sudden
that
there
did
be
a
little
glowing
in
the
night
and
the
glowing
was
pale
and
horrid
and
there
was
no
more
any
sound
of
the
spinning
only
there
did
be
as
it
were
the
trunk
of
a
great
tree
that
did
show
in
the
glowing
and
the
trunk
of
the
tree
came
toward
us
across
the
darkness
and
i
turned
the
maid
from
the
tree
and
she
did
flutter
a
little
in
my
hands
as
i
did
know
scarceknowing
for
she
perceived
that
she
did
be
going
to
die
in
that
moment
and
i
had
my
body
thus
between
the
evil
thing
and
the
maid
and
lo
the
tree
came
no
more
anigh
to
us
but
went
backward
and
the
pale
glowing
did
fade
and
the
tree
no
more
to
be
seen
and
i
cried
unto
the
maid
very
husky
that
we
did
live
for
that
the
evil
power
was
gone
off
from
us
but
she
answered
not
and
did
be
heavy
against
me
and
i
held
her
and
lookt
alway
about
us
lest
the
tree
come
in
upon
the
other
side
and
as
i
lookt
this
way
and
that
i
saw
naught
and
afterward
in
a
moment
i
searched
the
night
above
lest
that
the
thing
come
from
above
and
behold
i
saw
that
there
abode
over
us
a
clear
light
as
it
were
a
clear
burning
circle
above
us
in
the
night
and
my
heart
did
leap
with
an
holy
joy
and
an
utter
great
thankfulness
and
i
was
no
more
in
fear
of
the
tree
for
in
verity
there
fought
for
our
souls
one
of
those
sweet
powers
of
goodness
that
did
strive
ever
to
stand
between
the
forces
of
evil
and
the
spirit
of
man
and
this
matter
have
i
shown
to
you
before
this
time
and
concerning
this
holy
defense
i
have
thought
that
it
should
not
mayhap
to
have
had
so
strong
a
power
to
save
us
if
that
we
had
shown
an
overweakness
and
fear
but
because
that
we
did
rather
stand
so
well
as
we
might
to
make
battle
of
escape
from
so
dire
a
destruction
and
surely
this
doth
seem
but
a
sane
thinking
unto
me
but
yet
without
proof
and
to
be
said
to
you
only
as
the
shapings
of
my
thoughts
and
this
the
chief
end
of
that
happening
that
the
holy
circle
did
truly
deliver
us
and
burned
through
twelve
great
hours
above
us
and
by
this
do
i
know
that
the
evil
power
hovered
anigh
to
destroy
us
all
that
while
for
indeed
it
doth
not
be
proper
of
reason
to
suppose
that
such
an
utter
wondrous
thing
did
be
needlessly
over
us
save
to
be
a
shield
of
great
and
lovely
force
against
a
waiting
evil
thing
and
surely
you
do
see
thiswise
with
me
and
truly
so
soon
as
my
spirit
and
reason
perceived
that
we
did
be
no
more
to
suffer
from
the
evil
thing
i
remembered
that
i
did
know
that
mine
own
had
swooned
and
in
verity
you
shall
mind
how
that
she
did
face
her
death
so
utter
sweet
and
brave
and
had
given
no
cry
but
made
quietly
to
help
me
in
that
dreadful
moment
and
did
stand
brave
and
gentle
to
the
stroke
and
so
fell
into
a
swoon
as
you
have
seen
because
that
she
did
suffer
an
hundred
deaths
as
she
did
stand
so
brave
waiting
to
be
slain
for
the
blow
did
be
so
long
delayed
yet
to
come
in
any
moment
and
i
gat
her
to
cometo
unto
her
life
again
and
i
set
the
lovely
tale
very
swift
to
ease
her
and
surely
with
love
and
warmth
and
kist
her
with
a
great
joy
and
i
showed
how
i
did
honour
her
for
her
good
courage
and
she
to
weep
a
little
with
the
ease
come
so
sudden
upon
her
and
afterward
to
kiss
me
upon
the
lips
an
hundred
times
and
to
need
that
she
be
very
safe
in
mine
arms
because
that
i
had
meant
that
i
do
so
dread
an
office
to
her
and
surely
i
do
wonder
whether
you
perceive
all
that
did
be
then
in
her
heart
and
the
holy
light
that
did
be
over
us
she
did
watch
with
a
sweetness
of
awe
and
rest
did
come
more
great
upon
her
in
the
heart
as
she
did
learn
how
sure
was
the
seeming
of
that
lovely
power
to
deliver
us
and
presently
we
made
forward
again
in
the
valley
and
did
go
steadfast
and
newlyloving
each
to
the
other
and
so
through
twelve
great
and
bodyweary
hours
but
our
hearts
could
never
be
done
singing
within
us
nor
our
hands
to
cease
from
the
hands
of
the
other
because
that
we
did
so
crave
each
unto
the
beloved
and
in
the
ninth
hour
a
monstrous
way
off
in
the
dark
of
the
valley
there
did
seem
as
that
there
went
a
far
and
dreadful
screaming
in
the
night
and
it
did
be
as
that
our
spirits
perceived
the
sound
of
something
spinning
in
the
night
yet
faint
and
a
great
way
off
but
yet
had
we
no
surety
that
we
did
truly
hear
the
sound
of
the
spinning
only
we
did
be
so
shaken
in
the
heart
for
truly
there
was
some
horror
done
unto
humans
downward
in
the
mighty
darkness
of
the
valley
and
to
think
upon
the
sound
of
the
spinning
was
to
be
in
a
shaking
trouble
of
the
spirit
and
to
bless
the
quiet
and
holy
light
that
went
above
us
in
all
that
time
and
to
ache
only
that
it
should
stay
to
be
to
our
protecting
and
surely
it
did
be
plain
that
there
were
the
signs
of
great
forces
in
that
land
and
three
hours
after
that
time
when
we
did
hear
the
faroff
screaming
we
were
come
up
over
the
edge
of
the
valley
and
did
be
once
more
unto
such
light
as
did
be
general
in
the
land
and
truly
it
did
seem
a
wondrous
lightness
after
so
utter
a
dark
and
we
did
be
all
exhaust
and
mine
own
drew
her
feet
so
weary
that
it
was
as
that
she
must
go
no
more
until
we
did
rest
for
indeed
it
was
three
and
thirty
hours
since
last
that
we
had
slept
and
a
bitter
trouble
and
work
there
had
been
in
that
space
as
you
do
know
now
we
had
eat
some
of
the
tablets
a
few
hours
back
as
we
did
walk
and
had
drunk
some
of
the
water
but
had
made
no
rest
for
we
did
crave
only
that
we
come
free
of
that
valley
and
now
it
was
needful
that
we
rest
if
but
a
little
time
and
i
minded
that
we
find
some
place
where
i
should
have
a
hot
pool
that
i
be
able
to
bathe
naanis
feet
and
surely
we
came
in
a
while
to
a
hollowplace
and
there
did
be
two
dullburning
fireholes
in
this
place
and
a
hotbubbling
spring
the
which
did
seem
to
be
a
rare
thing
in
that
land
so
that
we
were
the
more
fortunate
to
perceive
it
and
i
made
mine
own
to
sit
with
her
feet
in
the
hotspring
for
it
was
not
overhot
and
did
seem
pretty
natural
to
my
taste
as
i
did
prove
in
the
first
and
also
i
did
search
about
the
hollow
lest
there
be
any
harmful
creature
nearby
and
this
you
will
have
truly
supposed
because
you
do
know
the
methods
of
my
journeying
but
yet
did
i
not
have
so
much
care
as
did
be
proper
for
i
was
so
dull
in
the
mind
by
reason
of
my
weariness
but
indeed
there
came
naught
to
work
us
any
harm
and
so
we
came
to
no
suffering
through
mine
aches
and
dullness
and
i
sat
beside
the
maid
and
made
her
to
eat
a
tablet
and
saw
that
the
cloak
did
be
nice
about
her
and
her
head
to
rest
against
my
knee
and
i
laid
the
palm
of
my
hand
to
be
as
a
pillow
because
of
the
armour
to
ease
the
hardness
and
i
eat
with
the
maid
and
we
both
drank
after
and
so
there
came
back
somewhat
of
our
strength
then
i
took
the
maids
little
feet
and
rubbed
a
portion
of
the
ointment
from
the
pot
all
about
them
very
gentle
and
constant
and
so
did
they
be
newrested
and
eased
and
she
presently
fit
again
to
the
journey
for
i
was
strong
set
that
we
go
quickly
hence
out
of
that
land
and
stay
no
more
there
to
sleep
lest
we
come
unto
destruction
and
when
we
had
rested
an
hour
i
put
the
shoes
again
upon
the
maid
and
made
them
secure
and
so
gat
my
gear
about
me
and
made
to
the
journey
and
lo
as
we
did
leave
the
hollow
i
lookt
upward
unto
the
holy
light
and
behold
it
was
gone
from
us
and
by
this
thing
i
supposed
that
we
had
come
free
of
instant
danger
but
yet
did
there
be
to
me
a
seeming
of
nakedness
and
unprotection
as
you
must
perceive
and
because
that
the
light
was
vanished
i
was
the
more
set
that
we
come
speedy
out
of
the
land
and
we
went
forward
at
a
strong
speed
and
had
the
great
red
firepit
of
the
giants
to
our
rear
unto
the
left
and
a
mighty
way
off
in
the
night
but
yet
i
did
wish
it
the
further
and
before
us
was
a
small
ridging
up
of
the
dark
land
as
i
did
judge
because
that
our
view
of
the
lights
and
the
shinings
was
bounded
and
to
our
left
at
a
great
way
the
low
volcanoes
and
somewhat
to
our
right
across
all
that
part
of
the
land
went
the
cold
and
horrid
glare
of
the
shine
now
in
a
little
while
i
felt
that
the
ground
did
be
sloped
upward
before
us
a
little
and
by
this
thing
i
saw
that
i
had
known
aright
for
that
there
did
be
a
ridge
that
hid
the
land
somewise
over
unto
the
part
where
i
lookt
to
find
the
mouth
of
the
upward
gorge
and
we
went
up
this
slope
at
a
strong
pace
because
that
i
was
so
eager
that
i
find
where
we
did
be
in
nearness
unto
the
mouth
of
the
upward
gorge
and
surely
i
was
something
forgetful
in
mine
eagerness
and
came
somewhat
ahead
of
mine
own
who
did
make
to
hide
from
me
that
she
did
begin
to
lag
because
that
her
new
strength
was
near
gone
from
her
and
sudden
there
did
be
a
very
dreadful
cry
to
my
back
and
i
came
round
in
one
instant
so
quick
as
a
light
doth
flash
for
it
was
the
voice
of
mine
own
and
all
my
being
did
suddenly
burn
with
fear
that
kindled
through
me
in
a
moment
of
thought
and
lo
mine
own
did
struggle
terribly
with
a
yellow
thing
which
i
perceived
to
be
a
man
with
four
arms
and
the
man
had
two
arms
about
the
maid
and
with
two
did
make
to
choke
her
unto
death
for
she
cried
out
no
more
and
i
came
unto
the
man
with
a
quick
leaping
and
stopt
not
to
pluck
the
diskos
from
my
hip
and
surely
i
did
be
very
strong
and
mine
anger
and
rage
to
make
me
monstrous
for
i
caught
the
two
upper
arms
of
the
man
and
brought
them
backward
in
an
instant
so
fierce
and
savage
and
so
wrencht
upon
them
that
i
brake
them
in
the
shoulders
of
the
man
and
the
man
roared
and
shriekt
even
as
a
wild
and
dreadful
beast
should
cry
out
and
came
round
upon
me
with
the
two
lower
arms
and
surely
it
was
a
mighty
and
brutish
thing
and
so
broad
and
bulkt
as
an
ox
and
the
lower
arms
were
huge
and
greatly
haired
and
the
fingers
of
the
hands
did
have
the
nails
grown
into
horrid
talons
as
that
they
should
grip
very
bitter
and
it
caught
me
by
the
thighs
to
rip
me
upward
as
i
did
fear
but
yet
this
did
not
be
the
intent
of
the
man
for
in
a
moment
it
caught
me
round
the
body
and
on
the
instant
i
gat
the
man
by
the
great
throat
and
the
throat
did
be
haired
and
so
great
as
the
neck
of
a
bull
and
i
strove
with
mine
armoured
hands
that
i
choke
the
man
and
surely
i
made
it
to
suffer
great
trouble
yet
i
could
not
harm
it
in
the
life
and
so
i
did
be
an
horrid
minute
and
fought
with
the
beast
with
no
more
than
the
strength
of
my
body
and
it
was
as
that
an
human
went
with
his
hands
to
slay
a
monster
so
strong
as
an
horse
and
the
breath
of
the
manbeast
came
at
me
and
did
sicken
me
and
i
held
the
face
off
from
me
for
i
had
died
with
horror
if
that
it
had
come
more
anigh
and
surely
the
mouth
of
the
man
was
small
and
shaped
so
that
i
knew
that
it
did
never
eat
of
aught
that
it
did
slay
but
to
drink
as
a
vampire
and
in
truth
i
did
mean
that
i
chop
the
man
to
pieces
if
that
i
have
chance
to
the
diskos
and
i
did
sway
this
way
and
that
as
we
did
struggle
and
surely
it
was
as
that
the
man
had
never
made
to
use
the
lower
arms
save
to
hold
unto
prey
the
while
that
it
did
use
the
upper
arms
to
strangle
as
i
do
think
for
all
that
weary
minute
of
the
fight
the
man
made
not
to
loose
from
me
that
it
should
tear
my
hands
from
their
grip
to
the
throat
but
made
vain
waggings
with
the
arms
that
i
brake
as
that
it
would
use
these
to
the
attack
but
surely
they
had
no
more
power
to
do
hurt
and
sudden
it
put
forth
an
utter
power
about
my
body
so
that
mine
armour
did
be
like
to
crack
and
truly
i
had
died
in
a
moment
but
for
the
strongness
of
the
armour
and
the
man
hugged
me
thus
for
an
horrid
time
the
while
that
i
did
hold
off
from
me
the
brutish
face
and
gript
very
savage
into
the
haired
throat
and
lo
the
creature
did
work
slow
in
the
brain
and
in
the
end
loost
from
me
abrupt
and
went
back
with
a
leap
so
that
my
hands
did
be
ript
from
the
throat
of
the
beast
and
in
one
instant
it
did
be
back
unto
me
and
gave
me
no
moment
to
free
the
diskos
but
i
made
anew
to
fight
and
shaped
as
i
had
learned
in
the
exercises
of
mine
upbringing
for
truly
i
had
been
alway
deep
in
practice
of
such
matters
and
i
slipt
from
the
great
hands
of
the
man
as
it
did
try
to
take
me
by
the
head
and
i
hit
the
man
with
mine
armoured
fist
and
put
a
great
power
and
skill
to
the
blow
and
i
went
instant
to
the
side
with
a
swift
stepping
and
evaded
the
man
and
i
smote
the
man
again
and
took
him
very
savage
in
the
neck
but
all
the
while
grown
very
cold
and
brutal
and
cruel
for
i
was
set
to
the
slaying
and
the
manbeast
came
round
on
me
and
lo
i
slipt
the
gripe
of
the
great
hands
and
my
body
and
my
legs
and
mine
arms
did
work
together
unto
that
last
blow
so
that
i
did
hit
so
hard
as
a
great
hammer
and
i
gat
the
beast
in
the
throat
and
the
beast
went
backward
to
the
earth
even
as
it
did
think
to
hold
me
and
lo
in
a
moment
i
was
free
and
i
pluckt
forth
the
diskos
from
my
hip
and
the
yellow
beastman
grunted
upon
the
ground
and
it
rose
up
again
to
come
at
me
and
it
stood
and
did
grunt
and
did
seem
as
that
it
was
gone
mazed
for
it
did
make
other
sounds
and
an
horrid
screeching
so
that
truly
by
the
way
of
it
i
conceived
that
it
cried
out
unknown
and
halfshapen
words
at
me
and
in
a
moment
it
came
again
at
me
but
i
cut
the
head
from
the
beastman
that
was
in
verity
an
horrid
monster
and
the
man
died
and
was
quiet
upon
the
earth
and
truly
in
that
moment
the
distress
of
mine
efforts
and
mine
utter
tiredness
and
the
ache
of
the
bruises
took
me
so
that
i
do
surely
think
i
rockt
as
i
stood
but
yet
was
my
head
strong
to
think
and
my
heart
set
in
anxiousness
for
i
wotted
not
how
great
an
hurt
had
been
done
upon
mine
own
and
i
ran
to
her
and
came
to
where
she
did
be
upon
the
ground
and
surely
she
was
all
huddled
and
had
her
hands
very
piteous
to
her
throat
that
did
be
so
pretty
and
it
did
shake
me
in
that
moment
that
she
was
truly
slain
for
she
was
gone
so
utter
still
and
as
that
she
did
be
broken
unto
death
and
i
took
her
hands
from
her
throat
and
surely
it
did
be
a
little
torn
yet
not
to
be
much
or
so
that
it
should
loose
her
of
her
dear
life
and
i
strove
that
i
steady
the
trembling
of
my
hands
and
i
gat
free
of
mine
armoured
gloves
and
made
that
i
feel
whether
her
throat
did
be
deadly
hurt
and
in
verity
it
seemed
not
so
only
that
my
hands
did
so
shake
because
that
i
was
so
frightened
for
mine
own
and
because
that
i
was
but
new
come
from
the
battle
and
because
of
this
i
had
not
power
of
touch
to
assure
me
i
made
then
that
i
quieten
my
breath
which
did
yet
come
very
full
and
laboured
and
i
put
mine
ear
above
the
heart
of
the
maid
and
lo
her
heart
did
beat
and
the
horridness
of
my
fear
went
from
me
in
a
moment
and
i
had
the
scrip
from
my
back
very
speedy
and
some
of
the
water
to
fizz
and
i
dashed
the
water
upon
her
face
and
upon
her
throat
and
surely
there
did
be
a
little
quivering
and
an
answering
of
her
body
and
i
strove
with
her
for
a
while
more
and
she
came
unto
her
life
again
and
in
the
first
she
was
all
alack
as
you
may
think
and
immediately
she
began
that
she
remembered
and
she
then
to
shake
and
i
told
her
how
that
the
fourarmed
man
was
surely
dead
and
could
harm
her
no
more
and
she
then
to
weep
because
that
she
had
been
put
to
such
shock
and
horror
and
held
by
so
brutish
a
thing
but
i
took
her
into
mine
arms
and
so
she
did
come
presently
to
an
ease
and
i
perceived
in
all
my
being
that
she
was
as
a
little
ship
that
doth
lie
in
harbour
for
she
did
cling
and
nestle
unto
me
and
did
be
safe
with
me
in
all
her
heart
and
body
and
belief
and
surely
she
was
mine
own
and
i
to
have
glory
in
that
knowing
and
presently
i
put
her
from
mine
arms
to
lie
yet
so
that
she
might
not
perceive
the
body
of
the
yellow
beastman
and
i
made
clean
the
diskos
from
her
sight
and
afterward
i
put
on
the
scrip
and
i
took
the
maid
to
mine
arms
again
and
had
the
diskos
in
my
hand
beside
her
and
she
made
protest
that
she
should
truly
walk
for
that
i
was
all
aweary
and
she
come
to
her
strength
again
and
indeed
i
carried
her
a
certain
way
and
did
then
put
her
down
to
her
feet
and
truly
her
knees
did
so
tremble
that
she
had
not
stood
let
be
to
walk
and
i
caught
her
up
again
and
i
kist
her
and
i
told
her
that
i
did
be
surely
her
master
in
verity
and
she
mine
own
babyslave
and
truly
you
shall
not
laugh
upon
me
for
i
was
so
human
as
any
and
a
man
doth
talk
this
way
with
his
maid
and
she
did
be
quiet
and
sweet
and
to
obey
wisely
for
she
was
gone
very
weak
and
thiswise
we
did
go
and
i
to
say
loving
words
in
the
first
but
afterward
i
did
heed
more
of
my
going
now
that
she
was
something
eased
and
at
rest
within
mine
arms
and
i
did
peer
everywhere
about
lest
that
some
other
evil
thing
come
outward
of
the
bushes
to
have
at
us
ere
i
did
ware
and
truly
the
bushes
grew
here
and
there
in
that
place
very
plentiful
in
great
dumpings
and
presently
i
was
come
to
the
top
part
of
the
ridge
and
lo
a
great
gladness
took
me
and
some
amazement
for
there
did
be
the
lights
that
did
be
in
the
mouth
of
the
upward
gorge
and
they
did
show
me
that
i
was
come
anigh
to
that
place
yet
had
i
feared
that
we
were
surely
a
dozen
great
miles
off
and
now
i
to
learn
that
we
did
be
scarce
of
two
or
maybe
three
as
i
did
judge
and
i
told
this
thing
to
the
maid
and
she
rejoiced
in
mine
arms
with
a
deep
and
quiet
thankfulness
and
i
set
forward
then
at
so
good
a
pace
as
i
might
and
i
was
come
into
the
mouthpart
of
the
upward
gorge
in
about
an
hour
and
surely
i
did
be
very
weary
for
it
was
beyond
six
and
thirty
hours
that
we
had
gone
since
last
we
did
sleep
and
there
had
been
sore
labour
and
terror
to
our
share
in
that
time
as
i
have
told
and
i
turned
in
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
and
told
mine
own
very
gentle
that
we
did
take
our
last
look
upon
that
land
and
she
askt
that
i
put
her
down
to
her
feet
and
i
put
her
down
and
therewith
we
stood
in
that
place
and
mine
arm
about
her
and
so
did
i
support
the
maid
the
while
that
she
lookt
silent
over
the
dark
of
the
land
and
presently
she
askt
me
in
a
very
husht
voice
whether
that
i
knew
where
the
lesser
pyramid
did
be
in
all
that
darkness
for
she
was
all
adrift
of
her
bearings
and
was
as
a
stranger
because
that
she
had
never
lookt
upon
the
land
from
that
place
before
then
and
i
showed
her
where
i
thought
the
pyramid
to
stand
hid
in
the
everlasting
night
and
she
nodded
very
quiet
as
that
she
did
think
thatwise
also
and
so
a
time
did
pass
and
i
knew
that
naani
said
goodbye
forever
unto
all
that
she
had
known
of
the
world
in
all
her
life
and
she
did
be
whispering
a
goodbye
in
her
soul
unto
her
dead
and
i
was
very
husht
and
deeply
sorrowful
for
the
maid
and
did
understand
for
in
verity
there
should
no
other
human
look
upon
that
land
of
terror
through
all
the
quiet
of
eternity
and
the
maid
did
lose
all
her
young
life
into
that
blackness
and
the
father
that
was
her
father
and
the
grave
of
her
mother
and
the
friends
of
all
her
years
and
there
went
death
in
the
land
even
then
after
those
that
did
live
and
mine
own
shook
a
little
within
mine
arm
so
that
i
knew
she
strove
that
she
be
brave
to
weep
not
but
afterward
she
made
not
to
cease
from
her
tears
and
truly
i
was
there
to
be
her
understanding
and
she
did
be
sweet
and
natural
ever
with
me
for
she
was
mine
own
and
did
be
hourly
the
more
so
and
presently
i
moved
a
little
to
sign
that
we
go
downward
of
the
gorge
and
she
stayed
me
one
moment
that
she
look
once
more
over
all
that
land
and
afterward
she
submitted
and
turned
with
me
and
did
break
into
very
bitter
sobbing
as
she
did
go
stumbling
beside
me
for
the
sorrow
of
memory
did
fill
her
and
she
was
truly
a
very
lonesome
maid
in
that
moment
and
had
come
through
much
dreadfulness
and
in
a
minute
i
stoopt
and
lifted
her
and
she
wept
in
mine
arms
against
mine
armour
and
i
very
silent
and
tender
with
her
and
carried
her
downward
of
the
gorge
for
a
great
hour
more
and
presently
she
was
grown
calm
and
i
knew
that
she
slept
in
mine
arms
and
in
thiswise
we
made
farewell
of
that
dark
land
and
left
it
unto
eternity
xii
downward
of
the
gorge
now
i
carried
the
maid
an
hour
downward
of
the
gorge
as
i
did
say
and
i
was
then
grown
so
weary
that
i
near
fell
as
i
walked
and
stumbled
everywhile
because
that
i
had
lost
somewhat
of
guiding
in
my
feet
the
which
did
show
mine
utter
alackness
and
i
saw
that
i
must
come
very
swift
to
a
place
for
slumber
or
that
i
did
be
like
to
fall
headlong
with
the
maid
for
i
nigh
slept
as
i
walkt
and
i
began
that
i
give
attention
to
the
sides
of
the
gorge
and
surely
i
had
gone
that
hour
all
in
a
dream
for
i
was
freshwaked
as
it
were
in
that
i
did
give
my
will
to
perceive
aught
and
when
i
did
come
to
have
power
to
attend
i
knew
that
i
had
gone
even
as
a
sleepwalker
for
the
gorge
did
seem
a
fresh
matter
unto
me
and
as
that
i
had
come
awake
sudden
to
find
myself
awalk
in
that
strange
and
narrow
place
and
presently
i
saw
somewhat
where
i
did
be
for
i
minded
the
memory
of
mine
outward
journey
and
truly
i
have
a
good
power
to
know
and
remember
a
way
that
i
have
gone
and
i
saw
that
there
was
a
great
and
ruddy
firehole
anigh
to
me
and
i
was
all
sure
that
i
had
perceived
certain
caves
in
the
wall
of
the
gorge
near
to
that
fire
as
i
past
it
on
mine
upward
way
and
i
had
been
given
a
mighty
longing
of
heart
at
that
time
that
it
be
given
to
me
that
i
should
bring
safe
mine
own
out
of
the
peril
that
beset
her
and
have
her
unto
just
such
a
place
for
her
slumber
on
the
way
of
our
journey
backward
and
surely
i
tell
you
this
thing
as
a
child
in
pleasure
for
truly
it
was
a
wondrous
happy
matter
that
my
desiring
should
be
like
to
have
a
true
ending
as
indeed
it
did
seem
was
truly
to
be
if
that
my
memory
had
set
me
aright
and
i
went
onward
somewhat
and
lo
i
to
be
right
for
the
little
caves
did
be
there
a
little
past
the
great
firehole
and
there
were
seven
of
them
in
the
left
side
of
the
great
cliff
of
the
gorge
and
one
did
be
as
that
it
were
very
cozy
and
a
place
of
sure
safety
if
that
we
could
win
unto
it
and
truly
as
i
did
conceive
we
had
come
safe
from
the
evil
forces
of
that
land
but
yet
did
i
mind
that
there
was
no
surety
in
this
thing
and
neither
did
i
know
but
that
some
monster
should
come
downward
of
the
gorge
out
of
that
land
and
so
work
our
deaths
as
we
did
sleep
if
that
we
have
no
sure
place
for
our
slumber
and
indeed
i
had
wished
that
we
were
come
a
greater
way
downward
of
the
gorge
but
this
might
not
be
for
i
was
all
adrift
with
weariness
and
truly
if
that
we
gat
upward
to
the
topmost
cave
there
did
be
few
monsters
that
should
have
power
to
come
at
us
ere
we
be
warned
of
their
coming
and
afterward
they
should
be
like
to
come
upward
against
the
diskos
and
this
should
be
indeed
a
thing
difficult
as
you
shall
conceive
now
it
did
be
needful
that
i
wake
the
maid
and
i
kist
her
as
she
did
be
in
mine
arms
and
surely
that
dear
one
did
kiss
back
again
in
her
sleep
and
was
yet
asleep
and
truly
i
did
love
her
with
all
my
being
and
i
kist
her
again
and
shook
her
very
gentle
and
so
had
her
to
wakefulness
and
told
how
we
did
be
come
to
a
place
fit
for
our
slumber
and
she
to
look
about
very
sleepy
as
i
set
her
to
her
feet
and
then
to
upbraid
herself
that
she
did
over
to
slumber
the
while
that
i
did
labour
with
her
carrying
and
in
verity
i
kist
her
again
as
she
did
stand
making
to
steady
herself
and
looking
so
pretty
with
the
sleep
that
did
lie
yet
in
her
eyes
and
she
to
kiss
me
very
dear
and
all
mine
and
even
then
scarce
proper
come
to
wakefulness
and
did
say
with
something
of
a
little
dear
abandon
that
she
did
love
me
utter
and
forever
and
afterward
i
climbed
to
the
topmost
of
the
caves
and
told
mine
own
the
while
that
she
walk
up
and
down
a
little
so
that
she
come
to
a
full
awakedness
and
this
i
was
careful
to
because
that
she
should
have
a
need
of
all
her
powers
that
she
come
safe
upward
unto
the
cave
and
when
i
was
come
to
the
cave
lo
it
did
be
so
sweet
and
dry
as
did
make
glad
my
heart
and
there
did
be
a
warmth
in
the
cave
as
that
there
went
a
fire
somewhere
through
the
rocks
anigh
and
the
light
from
the
firehole
did
make
a
reflection
inward
and
so
this
did
seem
a
place
safe
and
fit
to
our
slumbering
and
i
came
downward
unto
naani
calling
that
the
cave
was
very
proper
for
our
use
and
presently
i
gave
her
mine
aid
to
the
climbing
and
so
we
came
in
the
end
safe
into
the
cave
and
truly
we
did
feel
very
safe
and
happy
yet
before
we
did
sleep
i
set
free
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
took
the
straps
and
went
downward
again
into
the
gorge
and
i
gat
a
good
boulder
so
heavy
as
i
might
carry
and
strapt
it
to
my
back
and
came
upward
again
to
the
cave
and
the
maid
very
grave
and
anxious
lest
that
i
slip
to
my
hurt
and
when
i
was
come
to
the
cave
again
i
set
the
boulder
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
did
balance
it
so
light
upon
the
edge
that
a
touch
should
send
it
rolling
downward
and
by
this
devising
i
conceived
that
any
beast
or
monstrous
thing
that
should
climb
upward
whilst
that
we
slept
should
be
like
to
set
the
rock
adrift
and
mayhaps
the
rock
to
work
an
harm
to
such
but
the
chief
end
to
be
that
i
should
be
swiftly
waked
by
the
noise
and
then
i
did
turn
that
we
go
to
our
slumber
and
lo
the
maid
had
spread
the
cloak
upon
the
rock
that
we
should
sleep
upon
it
for
truly
there
did
be
no
need
that
we
have
it
now
to
our
covering
because
that
the
cave
did
be
so
warm
as
i
have
told
before
and
surely
there
did
be
no
cause
either
that
i
should
have
the
cloak
for
a
bed
for
how
should
i
perceive
any
softness
from
the
cloak
through
all
the
sternness
of
mine
armour
but
yet
did
i
see
that
the
maid
had
made
a
couch
that
should
be
for
the
two
of
us
and
did
be
so
sweet
and
natural
and
to
lie
by
me
but
yet
to
preserve
her
sweet
modesty
and
to
do
the
thing
with
no
thought
save
that
it
was
natural
to
our
hearts
and
that
she
did
long
alway
to
be
anigh
to
me
but
yet
mayhaps
scarce
full
conscious
that
her
heart
did
prompt
her
in
this
thing
and
in
verity
i
loved
her
very
dear
and
surely
naani
showed
me
the
where
that
i
should
lie
upon
my
side
and
when
i
had
obeyed
she
kneeled
and
kist
me
on
the
lips
very
sober
and
loving
and
she
lay
down
then
upon
the
cloak
beside
me
and
truly
we
had
both
gone
to
sleep
in
one
little
minute
as
i
do
think
now
i
did
be
waked
twelve
great
hours
after
by
the
fizzing
of
the
water
and
lo
when
i
lookt
the
maid
was
not
beside
me
but
did
make
ready
our
simple
eating
and
drinking
and
she
laughed
at
me
very
sweet
and
tender
because
that
she
loved
me
so
and
did
be
so
glad
to
have
me
awake
to
her
and
she
came
over
to
me
and
kist
me
very
bright
and
loving
upon
the
lips
and
after
that
she
had
kist
me
she
kneeled
beside
me
and
lookt
at
me
very
dear
and
tender
so
that
i
knew
in
a
moment
that
she
had
waked
a
while
gone
and
watched
me
somewise
motherlike
as
i
did
sleep
but
how
i
knew
this
thing
i
am
not
sure
save
that
my
spirit
did
know
or
that
her
thoughts
did
have
tongues
unto
mine
and
truly
i
needed
that
i
be
so
loved
and
all
of
you
to
say
like
with
me
and
i
put
up
mine
arms
to
her
as
i
did
yet
lie
and
she
not
to
deny
me
but
came
into
mine
arms
and
did
snuggle
there
so
sweet
and
happy
and
gladly
and
with
so
true
a
delight
that
it
did
be
plain
how
she
did
love
in
all
her
body
and
spirit
to
be
anigh
to
me
as
i
to
her
yet
truly
as
you
do
mind
the
armour
did
be
upon
me
so
that
i
feared
to
take
her
very
strong
in
mine
arms
lest
i
hurt
the
dear
maid
and
surely
the
armour
did
be
a
stern
matter
for
her
to
nestle
unto
but
yet
mayhaps
did
the
sternness
something
please
her
womanheart
and
yet
again
mayhaps
to
lack
and
presently
she
made
that
she
would
go
from
me
and
i
loosed
mine
arms
from
her
very
ready
because
that
i
did
heed
alway
that
she
have
full
sweet
liberty
of
her
dear
maidenhood
and
i
to
be
watchful
sufficient
unto
this
end
yet
always
honest
and
wholesome
and
not
overpondering
even
in
this
my
care
and
this
proper
intending
you
shall
ever
perceive
if
that
your
hearts
do
strive
to
hearken
unto
my
heart
which
doth
speak
alway
before
you
and
the
maid
went
from
me
over
to
where
she
had
put
the
cup
of
the
water
and
the
tablets
and
i
to
make
to
rise
that
i
look
that
the
boulder
did
be
safe
untouched
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
but
she
called
unto
me
that
i
lie
backward
for
that
she
did
mean
gently
to
spoil
me
that
once
and
that
i
have
no
heed
to
the
boulder
or
whether
there
did
be
any
monster
or
beast
anigh
in
the
gorge
for
that
the
boulder
did
be
safe
as
i
did
balance
it
and
nowheres
any
creature
to
sight
in
the
gorge
for
she
had
lookt
oft
since
waking
to
this
end
and
truly
i
obeyed
and
lay
back
and
did
like
that
i
should
be
spoilt
as
we
do
say
and
naani
brought
the
cup
of
the
water
and
the
tablets
over
to
me
for
she
gat
them
from
the
scrip
before
i
had
it
to
my
pillow
in
that
while
when
i
had
gone
downward
for
the
boulder
and
surely
even
when
she
brought
the
cup
she
would
not
have
me
to
rise
but
took
my
head
upon
her
knees
and
kist
me
once
very
dainty
on
the
lips
and
i
very
happy
to
be
so
loved
and
wishful
no
otherwise
and
she
took
a
tablet
and
kist
it
and
gave
it
to
me
and
afterward
touched
another
to
my
lips
and
had
that
to
be
for
her
own
and
so
we
eat
and
were
very
glad
and
happy
someways
as
children
are
happy
and
our
hearts
all
at
ease
and
presently
we
eat
each
our
second
tablet
in
the
same
wise
as
the
first
and
truly
i
did
be
kist
more
than
once
and
afterward
we
drank
each
of
the
water
and
when
we
had
made
an
end
naani
told
me
that
i
move
to
stand
and
surely
i
wondered
and
i
stood
up
and
lo
i
near
cried
out
with
the
pains
of
my
bruisings
for
i
was
all
gone
stiff
in
my
sleep
and
as
that
i
did
be
more
sore
than
ever
and
this
to
be
because
i
had
fought
again
as
you
do
know
and
surely
had
been
hurt
more
by
the
fourarmed
man
than
i
had
known
and
i
perceived
then
that
naani
had
supposed
that
i
should
be
thus
pained
and
had
given
dear
thought
to
the
matter
and
truly
she
had
the
pot
of
the
ointment
ready
if
that
i
did
be
very
bad
that
she
rub
me
and
she
gave
me
aid
with
mine
armour
and
afterward
eased
me
with
my
garments
and
surely
i
did
be
utter
bruised
in
the
body
by
reason
of
the
violence
of
the
yellow
beastman
and
the
maid
had
somewhat
so
tender
and
sweet
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
upon
the
bruisings
that
i
did
be
very
happy
and
to
glow
with
contentment
and
she
had
me
to
lie
and
made
me
in
comfort
with
the
cloak
so
loving
and
grave
so
that
i
was
as
a
child
that
doth
be
cared
of
by
his
mother
and
she
did
rub
me
very
skilful
and
gentle
for
a
great
hour
until
i
was
all
refreshed
and
in
verity
she
was
a
lovely
wise
maid
and
as
the
maid
ministered
unto
me
i
lay
alway
very
restful
and
harked
to
the
low
sound
of
the
muttering
of
the
firehole
that
did
be
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
alway
i
did
feel
as
an
happy
child
that
doth
be
clothed
in
love
and
guided
in
wisdom
and
presently
when
that
the
maid
had
ended
her
dear
care
she
put
by
the
ointment
and
gave
me
her
hands
very
dainty
that
she
mean
to
aid
me
to
rise
and
surely
when
i
was
come
again
to
my
feet
i
was
all
eased
and
to
have
movement
with
no
great
pain
and
truly
this
made
me
wondrous
pleased
and
to
feel
new
couraged
for
i
had
been
troubled
that
i
should
be
so
helpless
in
that
i
did
be
the
protector
of
mine
own
and
when
i
had
tried
my
limbs
and
found
them
to
be
in
command
and
ready
i
lookt
about
for
my
garments
and
lo
the
maid
brought
me
my
spare
bodyvest
from
the
pouch
and
had
it
upon
her
arm
to
give
to
me
but
surely
she
denied
me
a
moment
of
the
vest
and
stood
before
me
and
had
an
admiring
and
wonder
very
sweet
and
honest
because
that
my
arms
did
be
so
great
and
hard
with
muscles
and
indeed
i
did
be
very
strong
as
you
have
perceived
for
i
did
be
alway
in
affection
of
the
exercises
that
were
taught
in
the
upbringing
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
by
this
explaining
you
shall
understand
that
i
was
like
to
be
strong
but
indeed
i
owed
the
straightness
and
shaping
of
my
body
to
the
mother
that
bore
me
and
afterward
in
all
my
life
had
i
taken
pride
of
my
body
to
be
of
health
and
to
have
strength
and
surely
this
is
a
matter
very
fit
for
pride
and
to
be
told
bravely
and
with
honesty
and
the
admiring
of
the
maid
was
very
sweet
to
me
and
in
verity
i
did
be
to
deceive
if
that
i
said
otherwise
and
in
a
moment
she
dropt
my
bodyvest
and
put
out
her
hands
to
me
that
i
take
her
into
mine
arms
and
i
took
the
maid
into
mine
arms
with
a
great
gladness
and
with
somewhat
of
humbleness
that
i
was
nowise
good
enough
to
hold
her
for
my
heart
was
young
and
i
loved
her
very
dear
and
youthful
and
she
did
lie
there
very
quiet
and
happy
a
little
and
surely
i
did
find
presently
that
she
kist
the
great
muscling
of
my
breast
very
sweet
and
sly
where
her
face
did
be
press
against
it
and
lo
in
a
moment
she
came
free
of
mine
arms
and
gave
me
an
aid
with
my
garments
and
afterward
with
mine
armour
and
when
that
this
was
done
she
stood
off
from
me
and
she
lookt
at
me
half
shy
and
half
of
sweetness
and
naughtiness
and
she
came
then
in
a
moment
and
put
her
hands
upward
to
my
shoulders
and
so
stood
her
eyelids
something
down
over
her
eyes
and
did
steal
a
little
look
up
this
time
and
that
and
lo
in
a
sudden
moment
before
i
did
wot
she
was
to
her
knees
before
me
and
did
weep
and
i
down
very
swift
to
kneel
with
her
and
i
askt
not
why
she
wept
for
i
perceived
that
she
did
have
joy
and
glad
happiness
and
sweet
trouble
of
her
man
and
that
she
did
be
a
true
woman
and
one
part
of
the
woman
did
worship
so
that
she
did
be
strangely
humble
and
nigh
to
be
shy
and
another
did
love
and
need
that
she
be
anigh
to
me
and
a
third
to
have
a
calm
wisdom
and
all
did
now
be
atremble
together
in
her
heart
and
i
knew
that
i
did
be
truly
an
hero
to
her
though
but
usual
to
all
others
and
my
heart
was
wondrous
proud
and
wondrous
humble
so
that
i
was
in
the
same
moment
upraised
and
to
feel
dreadly
unworthy
but
i
made
no
pretending
to
discredit
myself
to
her
but
only
did
resolve
that
i
win
alway
her
dear
respect
and
i
did
be
natural
and
truthful
of
my
manner
and
without
foolish
denial
of
her
sweet
worship
for
she
was
utter
mine
own
and
it
did
be
a
pitiful
thing
if
that
i
seem
otherwise
than
an
hero
unto
her
but
of
you
i
ask
kind
understanding
and
to
call
me
not
a
thing
of
conceit
because
that
i
did
understand
for
truly
i
knew
my
faults
even
so
well
as
you
that
do
know
all
of
my
going
and
you
to
look
backward
upon
the
lovedays
and
to
mind
how
that
your
maid
did
ever
to
make
you
great
in
manhood
with
her
dear
belief
and
uplooking
and
so
shall
you
conceive
of
all
my
feelings
for
we
do
be
all
so
human
in
this
matter
and
to
meet
on
a
dear
natural
ground
as
you
will
say
and
truly
in
a
little
time
mine
own
did
be
steadied
and
wiped
her
pretty
eyes
and
nestled
to
me
a
while
very
husht
and
to
need
that
she
be
close
and
i
to
have
her
gentle
against
mine
armour
and
to
be
in
my
heart
as
that
i
did
be
her
father
and
her
lover
in
the
one
man
and
surely
to
be
silent
and
joyful
that
i
lived
and
presently
i
slipt
her
shoes
from
her
little
feet
with
my
right
hand
the
while
that
she
did
rest
within
my
left
arm
and
i
condemned
myself
that
i
had
thought
not
more
swift
to
this
end
but
indeed
i
had
thought
upon
it
while
that
naani
rubbed
me
and
had
intention
thiswise
but
afterward
forgat
as
you
shall
understand
that
have
been
with
me
alway
and
truly
mine
own
did
be
hurt
that
i
say
aught
to
my
blame
and
i
to
cease
but
yet
to
feel
reproached
by
my
heart
and
when
i
had
lookt
to
the
maids
feet
i
tied
on
her
shoes
again
and
we
gat
together
our
gear
and
afterward
we
came
down
from
the
cave
with
a
great
care
because
that
it
did
be
so
high
up
in
the
cliff
of
the
gorge
and
afterward
we
made
downward
of
the
gorge
and
had
a
good
care
to
our
going
and
so
much
of
speed
as
we
could
make
that
we
come
something
off
from
the
dark
land
of
the
lesser
redoubt
so
quick
as
we
might
and
in
six
hours
we
had
gone
very
well
and
we
stopt
then
that
we
eat
and
drink
and
afterward
i
lookt
again
to
the
feet
of
the
maid
and
i
bathed
them
in
a
great
rock
basin
of
warm
water
that
did
be
anigh
to
the
place
of
our
eating
and
afterward
i
put
the
ointment
about
them
very
thorough
and
gentle
and
for
a
good
while
and
so
she
had
some
ease
and
comfort
and
afterward
we
made
onward
again
but
now
we
did
go
pretty
easy
for
i
had
considered
the
notings
of
mine
outward
journey
and
so
did
perceive
that
we
should
be
but
six
or
seven
hours
off
that
part
of
the
gorge
where
did
be
the
slugs
and
i
was
minded
that
we
rest
and
sleep
ere
that
we
make
through
that
dire
and
dreadful
place
for
that
we
should
be
twelve
great
hours
and
more
to
go
through
and
to
have
no
rest
or
pause
until
that
we
did
be
safe
outward
again
as
you
shall
think
and
so
did
we
need
to
be
strong
and
well
rested
and
this
to
be
wise
also
for
the
feet
of
the
maid
now
surely
the
maid
did
be
in
delight
of
the
fires
of
that
part
of
the
gorge
where
we
were
come
and
she
had
beside
a
rest
of
the
soul
in
that
she
had
feeling
that
there
did
be
no
evil
force
to
trouble
us
to
our
destruction
and
i
bothered
her
not
yet
awhile
with
tellings
of
the
horrid
place
that
we
should
to
journey
through
in
a
while
as
you
do
know
and
so
we
did
go
and
alway
with
a
good
caution
lest
that
some
beast
or
creature
should
come
upon
us
and
alway
with
the
fireholes
before
and
behind
and
in
the
air
of
the
gorge
the
little
whistlings
of
steam
that
did
spirt
out
in
this
place
and
that
and
a
good
warmth
in
many
parts
by
reason
of
the
fires
and
odd
whiles
a
smelling
of
sulphur
but
not
greatly
nor
to
our
trouble
and
alway
the
low
muttering
of
the
fireholes
and
pits
and
the
red
lights
and
the
dancing
of
the
shadows
when
that
we
did
go
by
a
firepit
where
the
fire
did
frisk
and
burn
lively
and
upon
either
side
the
grim
walls
of
the
gorge
going
up
measureless
into
the
night
and
so
we
were
gone
presently
pretty
comfortable
for
six
good
hours
since
last
that
we
eat
and
we
made
halt
and
eat
and
drank
and
i
showed
the
maid
how
that
we
should
make
a
short
journey
that
day
and
sleep
and
so
be
ready
to
the
horrid
journey
through
the
dark
part
of
the
gorge
where
the
slugs
did
be
and
we
made
search
then
that
we
have
a
safe
place
to
our
slumber
and
surely
i
perceived
where
we
did
be
for
we
came
upon
that
same
cave
where
i
did
sleep
after
that
i
was
come
free
of
the
slugs
and
that
we
were
come
no
farther
doth
show
how
easy
did
be
our
present
going
and
this
you
do
know
and
there
did
be
the
spring
where
i
washed
and
the
firehole
anigh
and
truly
they
were
not
like
to
be
gone
away
as
you
shall
say
yet
did
we
exclaim
very
natural
for
the
maid
did
be
so
deep
in
interest
of
the
matters
of
my
coming
and
to
be
at
once
that
no
other
place
should
serve
for
our
rest
and
slumber
and
indeed
this
was
a
natural
thing
and
the
place
so
good
as
any
save
that
i
did
wish
it
had
been
upward
unto
a
high
place
of
the
gorge
as
you
shall
understand
but
yet
might
we
block
the
mouthpart
of
the
cave
with
boulders
somewise
as
i
did
before
and
so
to
have
a
defence
against
any
thing
that
should
make
to
enter
upon
our
sleep
or
at
the
least
to
be
waked
by
the
falling
of
the
boulders
now
mine
own
went
inward
of
the
little
cave
which
did
be
very
light
from
the
firepit
that
was
to
the
front
but
before
that
she
did
go
i
made
a
swift
search
of
the
place
that
there
should
be
no
creeping
thing
and
truly
it
was
sweet
and
free
and
the
maid
did
be
strangely
taken
that
she
should
come
to
the
veritable
place
where
once
i
did
lie
on
mine
outward
way
and
truly
i
do
understand
and
so
shall
many
that
do
have
these
feelings
about
matters
and
afterward
we
went
unto
the
hot
spring
that
was
in
the
hollow
of
the
rock
anigh
to
the
firepit
and
i
saw
that
there
did
be
no
snakes
neither
any
of
the
ratthings
anigh
and
so
i
had
the
maid
to
sit
very
comfortable
on
the
side
of
the
pool
and
i
freed
her
shoes
and
bathed
her
feet
and
afterward
rubbed
them
very
steady
with
the
ointment
and
so
for
a
good
time
and
alway
to
keep
a
looking
out
upon
the
gorge
and
presently
when
that
i
had
taken
a
loving
care
of
her
pretty
feet
i
tied
the
shoes
again
upon
the
maid
and
so
back
to
the
cave
and
the
two
of
us
to
carry
boulders
according
to
our
strength
and
when
we
had
a
sufficient
we
builded
a
rough
and
clumsy
wall
after
that
we
were
gone
into
the
cave
and
the
wall
rose
nigh
to
fill
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
made
us
to
be
somewise
in
darkness
but
yet
to
feel
in
safety
and
i
had
a
good
heed
to
make
the
chinks
of
the
wall
very
close
in
the
bottom
so
that
no
small
creeping
thing
should
come
through
unto
us
whilst
that
we
slept
and
afterward
naani
set
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
to
be
for
my
pillow
but
had
the
bundle
of
her
torn
garments
to
be
for
her
own
purpose
and
i
perceived
that
she
had
the
waterpowder
and
a
pack
of
the
tablets
to
her
hand
for
our
waking
that
she
might
prepare
our
food
and
mayhap
to
wake
a
little
before
me
so
that
she
have
all
ready
to
greet
me
from
my
sleep
but
indeed
i
said
naught
to
show
that
i
knew
for
i
saw
that
this
thing
did
give
her
a
dear
pleasure
and
truly
it
was
very
sweet
to
have
her
to
these
gentle
duties
that
did
be
to
her
so
sure
and
quiet
a
delight
and
mine
own
bade
me
that
i
lie
and
she
put
the
diskos
upon
the
outward
side
of
me
to
mine
hand
and
with
a
dainty
and
fearful
touch
for
the
weapon
did
be
very
dreadful
unto
her
thoughts
but
yet
a
comforting
thing
to
abide
for
our
defence
and
afterward
she
covered
me
with
the
cloak
and
kist
me
very
sedate
upon
the
lips
and
then
to
her
own
side
and
to
come
very
nice
and
happy
under
the
cloak
and
so
to
her
rest
and
presently
she
did
sleep
as
i
perceived
by
her
breathings
and
surely
it
did
seem
to
my
spirit
that
she
had
an
utter
and
dear
content
in
this
arranging
of
our
slumber
so
that
she
did
be
all
at
peace
in
all
her
being
because
that
she
did
be
nigh
unto
me
that
did
be
her
own
love
but
indeed
i
could
not
sleep
for
a
time
and
surely
in
a
while
mine
own
did
nestle
unto
me
in
her
sleep
so
sweet
and
dear
as
a
child
and
likewise
as
that
it
did
be
her
right
to
be
so
anigh
unto
me
and
i
to
be
that
i
should
put
mine
arms
about
her
but
indeed
i
moved
not
neither
did
i
kiss
her
as
i
did
wish
for
truly
i
should
be
very
manly
with
mine
own
maid
that
did
be
so
trustful
and
utter
mine
in
her
sleep
and
presently
i
was
over
unto
slumber
also
and
stirred
not
for
eight
good
hours
and
did
wake
then
to
the
hissing
of
the
water
so
that
i
knew
mine
own
was
awake
before
me
as
she
had
planned
and
was
making
ready
that
we
eat
and
when
she
saw
me
move
in
the
halflight
she
gave
out
a
little
word
of
joy
that
i
did
be
again
to
knowledge
of
her
and
she
came
over
and
put
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
kist
me
very
loving
thrice
upon
the
lips
and
in
verity
it
came
to
me
in
that
moment
that
i
had
been
kist
a
while
gone
in
my
dreams
but
scarce
to
know
it
yet
i
perceived
now
that
mine
own
had
taken
a
naughty
advantaging
of
my
slumber
that
she
kiss
me
to
her
own
pleasure
yet
did
the
maid
say
no
word
of
her
naughtiness
and
i
to
be
likewise
but
to
resolve
that
i
waken
mayhaps
on
the
next
time
and
so
catch
her
in
her
sweet
and
secret
delight
of
me
and
truly
this
doth
sound
quaint
but
to
be
true
and
i
rose
and
took
down
the
half
of
the
wall
that
did
be
across
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
afterward
lookt
out
but
there
was
no
sight
of
any
horrid
thing
in
the
gorge
save
that
one
of
the
ratthings
did
slumber
very
gorgedseeming
upon
the
side
of
the
little
fire
hole
and
afterwards
we
eat
and
drank
and
the
maid
then
to
rub
me
as
before
for
i
was
greatly
stiff
on
my
waking
as
you
shall
think
but
she
came
not
into
mine
arms
presently
as
i
did
hope
but
only
kist
my
shoulders
when
that
she
had
finished
and
so
bid
me
to
dress
yet
after
that
i
was
drest
and
had
mine
armour
full
upon
me
she
must
come
unto
me
and
she
slipt
her
two
small
hands
into
the
one
of
mine
and
so
stood
by
me
very
silent
and
sudden
she
put
up
her
lips
very
quiet
and
passionate
that
i
should
kiss
her
and
she
kist
me
once
as
it
did
be
as
that
her
spirit
kist
mine
and
all
her
being
came
unto
me
and
she
gave
me
but
that
one
kiss
and
afterward
slipt
her
hands
very
gentle
from
mine
and
made
to
the
gathering
of
our
gear
but
truly
i
that
loved
her
so
great
knew
that
a
tumult
of
love
did
be
hid
in
her
heart
and
indeed
she
looked
once
at
me
in
such
wise
that
i
grew
near
to
a
true
humbleness
of
heart
because
of
the
honour
and
love
that
did
be
in
her
eyes
and
surely
it
is
a
very
little
thing
to
die
for
such
an
one
as
mine
own
did
be
and
by
this
saying
shall
you
perceive
my
heart
in
that
moment
and
that
i
did
pant
as
it
were
that
i
do
some
deed
of
love
to
show
my
love
and
truly
this
is
but
a
natural
desiring
and
human
and
the
cause
proper
to
the
uplifting
of
manhood
and
surely
you
shall
all
mind
you
of
such
feelings
in
the
past
lovedays
that
i
do
pray
should
be
never
past
and
when
we
had
our
gear
together
i
left
it
in
the
cave
and
took
mine
own
over
unto
the
hot
pool
that
was
anigh
to
the
firepit
and
she
to
exclaim
upon
the
ratthing
that
did
be
yet
aslumber
upon
the
side
of
the
firepit
and
i
to
say
that
the
thing
did
be
no
cause
for
fear
but
rather
indeed
a
good
friend
in
that
it
was
a
devourer
of
snakes
as
you
shall
mind
and
while
that
we
talked
i
bathed
the
little
feet
of
naani
and
surely
as
i
dried
them
upon
my
pocketcloth
i
was
taken
that
i
should
kiss
them
and
surely
i
kist
them
and
they
did
be
very
shapely
and
dainty
and
all
eased
of
travel
by
the
care
that
i
did
take
to
this
end
and
afterward
i
rubbed
them
with
the
ointment
for
a
good
while
and
so
had
them
again
into
the
shoes
and
the
maid
very
quiet
after
that
i
had
kist
her
feet
that
did
be
so
dainty
but
yet
with
a
sweet
naughtiness
in
her
way
as
my
heart
perceived
though
she
did
nothing
neither
said
anything
to
this
end
and
was
truly
very
obedient
and
orderly
to
all
my
wishes
and
we
went
back
then
to
the
cave
and
the
maid
put
the
pot
of
the
ointment
back
into
the
pouch
and
she
buckled
the
pouch
and
the
scrip
upon
me
and
the
diskos
i
had
upon
my
hip
for
i
went
nowise
anywhere
without
it
as
you
shall
suppose
and
she
had
the
little
bundle
of
her
clothing
for
her
burden
and
truly
i
was
ready
that
she
should
carry
so
much
for
we
did
be
to
act
wisely
and
she
well
able
to
carry
so
small
a
thing
and
i
better
to
have
my
hands
alway
free
to
the
diskos
and
to
the
needs
of
the
way
and
we
went
downward
of
the
gorge
at
a
strong
speed
for
there
did
be
somewise
of
fifteen
hours
good
journey
ere
that
we
come
out
upon
the
far
side
of
that
place
where
the
monsters
did
be
and
this
did
be
three
hours
to
the
upward
beginning
of
that
place
and
twelve
hours
journey
then
in
the
least
that
we
should
take
to
go
through
again
into
the
light
of
the
gorge
below
and
this
i
did
reckon
from
my
notings
of
mine
upward
journey
as
you
do
know
and
i
made
all
clear
to
the
maid
of
the
thing
that
did
be
before
us
and
made
not
to
hide
the
danger
and
horror
but
yet
to
make
not
overmuch
of
the
same
and
she
to
walk
close
beside
me
very
sweet
and
trustful
and
to
say
that
she
feared
naught
so
that
i
should
be
there
to
have
care
of
her
but
only
that
she
did
fear
harm
for
me
and
yet
to
have
confidence
that
i
should
slay
all
hurtful
things
that
should
be
like
to
trouble
us
and
truly
i
did
kiss
her
for
her
dear
belief
and
love
now
in
the
middle
part
of
the
third
hour
the
air
of
the
gorge
did
begin
that
it
was
heavy
and
to
have
a
seeming
of
fumes
that
stang
something
upon
the
throat
odd
whiles
and
there
were
presently
less
of
the
fireholes
and
soon
as
we
did
go
the
more
downward
the
beginnings
of
a
great
gloom
and
to
have
smoke
therein
that
made
us
to
feel
husky
and
in
the
end
of
the
fourth
hour
we
were
come
truly
far
downward
within
the
gloom
and
to
be
as
that
we
groped
in
a
fog
of
distaste
and
to
know
not
how
we
went
with
any
surety
for
oft
there
did
be
an
utter
darkness
about
us
and
awhile
the
shine
of
a
dullglowing
firepit
upon
our
sight
that
did
show
us
the
gloom
and
dread
of
that
place
and
we
went
alway
very
husht
and
the
maid
to
my
back
but
i
did
halt
now
and
this
time
and
make
to
know
how
she
did
be
and
surely
she
whispered
very
brave
to
me
through
the
dimness
and
once
did
slip
her
hand
into
mine
and
i
to
take
off
mine
armoured
glove
for
a
little
moment
that
i
hold
her
hand
and
give
her
nice
assurance
but
in
verity
there
was
terror
in
mine
heart
that
did
be
a
terror
far
beyond
the
trouble
of
mine
upward
way
and
surely
i
was
shaken
newly
with
every
danger
lest
that
i
should
lose
mine
own
or
she
to
come
to
any
hurt
and
indeed
you
shall
perceive
how
i
did
be
for
so
should
you
be
in
a
like
case
and
in
truth
it
doth
be
an
utter
anxiousness
and
suffering
now
when
we
had
been
two
hours
in
the
dark
part
of
the
gorge
i
smelled
of
the
dread
and
horrid
stink
that
you
do
wot
of
and
surely
a
great
fear
came
upon
me
for
i
perceived
that
we
did
come
among
the
monsters
or
that
one
came
anigh
to
us
and
i
whispered
unto
the
maid
that
she
halt
and
we
stood
very
husht
a
while
and
surely
the
stink
did
grow
and
to
be
very
dreadful
in
the
nostrils
so
that
i
felt
mine
own
maid
to
shake
somewhat
with
the
fear
and
disgust
that
this
thing
did
make
in
us
and
presently
the
stinking
did
ease
somewhat
from
about
us
but
whether
there
had
gone
past
us
a
monster
slug
i
have
no
sure
knowing
for
there
did
be
no
firepit
anigh
to
that
place
so
that
there
was
a
great
darkness
all
about
and
surely
there
was
a
great
slowness
and
wetness
of
the
air
and
dismal
drippings
that
made
desolation
in
the
silence
and
the
feel
of
strange
growths
upon
the
boulders
as
you
do
know
and
oft
an
horrid
slime
and
dankness
and
the
stink
to
be
everywhere
so
that
we
knew
a
constant
disgust
and
fear
and
alway
the
fumings
of
sulphur
that
did
seem
in
verity
to
beat
down
upon
us
utter
heavy
and
sore
upon
our
lungs
and
so
went
we
onward
amid
the
smell
that
did
be
as
of
dead
things
and
oft
did
we
make
pause
and
hark
and
had
a
great
care
as
we
did
go
by
the
dull
fireholes
and
firepits
that
we
should
make
no
showing
of
ourselves
in
the
light
and
sudden
as
we
did
go
by
a
great
pit
that
burned
very
deep
and
red
i
reached
back
and
caught
mine
own
by
the
arm
and
i
set
her
gaze
unto
the
right
side
of
the
gorge
which
was
beyond
the
fire
and
the
maid
went
very
still
as
she
did
see
the
thing
that
was
there
for
in
verity
it
was
utter
monstrous
and
did
shine
very
wetlooking
in
the
light
of
the
fire
and
truly
it
moved
a
little
with
the
head
this
way
and
that
stretching
through
the
dark
and
the
shadows
as
you
shall
see
a
slug
to
move
and
with
no
speed
or
sound
and
nowise
seeming
heedful
of
aught
but
yet
did
i
fear
that
it
smelled
us
if
this
might
be
and
this
as
you
shall
think
to
be
a
very
natural
fear
and
alway
as
i
do
mind
it
seemed
to
go
blindly
somewise
or
to
have
that
slow
and
strange
moving
that
doth
make
one
to
think
of
a
blindness
but
whether
it
did
be
truly
blind
how
shall
i
say
only
that
it
was
an
utter
monstrous
brute
so
great
as
the
black
hull
of
a
ship
and
very
dreadful
unto
our
hearts
and
we
moved
not
for
a
while
save
that
i
pulled
mine
own
down
into
the
hiding
of
the
boulders
of
that
part
and
she
to
put
her
hand
very
anxious
unto
me
yet
not
to
be
comforted
as
i
did
half
to
think
but
to
persuade
me
lest
that
i
go
to
some
adventuring
that
should
set
me
in
a
surer
danger
and
this
i
perceived
in
a
little
moment
and
loved
her
for
her
care
but
indeed
i
had
no
mind
to
aught
save
that
we
come
clear
of
that
place
and
i
watched
the
monster
through
places
between
the
boulders
and
surely
in
a
little
while
it
swayed
the
great
head
very
slow
and
quiet
unto
the
cliff
that
did
make
that
side
of
the
gorge
and
the
brute
set
unto
the
cliff
and
began
that
it
went
upward
with
a
strange
moving
of
muscles
that
did
go
wavewise
under
the
wet
and
horridgleaming
hide
and
so
in
a
little
time
it
was
gone
quiet
against
the
cliff
and
the
headpart
did
be
upward
in
the
darkness
above
so
that
it
did
be
from
our
sight
but
the
monster
body
did
be
plain
for
a
great
way
and
was
seeming
clung
to
the
cliff
and
to
come
downward
out
of
the
dark
as
that
it
did
be
a
great
black
ridge
of
soft
and
dreadful
life
upon
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
the
tail
was
something
less
bulked
and
to
taper
and
did
trail
outward
into
the
gorge
upon
the
boulders
and
surely
the
thing
did
seem
as
that
it
slept
but
that
odd
whiles
the
tail
did
lift
a
little
off
the
boulders
and
curl
somewise
and
afterward
come
down
again
upon
the
boulders
mayhap
in
this
place
and
mayhap
in
that
place
as
we
did
watch
all
hid
and
it
was
as
that
our
sense
and
our
spirits
did
assure
us
that
the
thing
had
no
wotting
of
us
but
surely
our
fears
did
nigh
to
equal
the
comfort
of
this
sweet
reason
and
to
make
us
think
otherwise
yet
in
a
time
i
made
that
we
go
forward
together
through
the
spaces
that
did
be
among
the
boulders
and
i
went
creeping
and
the
maid
to
follow
likewise
and
oft
i
did
pause
and
made
a
watching
upon
the
monster
but
truly
it
moved
not
save
as
i
have
told
and
i
kept
a
great
heed
upon
the
maid
that
she
follow
alway
close
unto
my
feet
and
in
the
end
we
came
safe
from
that
place
where
the
monster
did
be
clung
unto
the
great
cliff
in
the
night
and
we
went
then
for
two
great
hours
without
adventure
save
that
once
the
maid
touched
me
that
we
pause
for
that
something
went
by
us
where
we
did
be
in
an
utter
dark
place
of
the
gorge
and
no
firehole
anigh
and
i
knew
that
the
thing
did
be
near
even
as
the
maid
toucht
me
and
caught
i
the
maid
in
the
dark
and
thrust
her
under
the
side
of
a
boulder
and
i
crouched
then
before
her
with
mine
armour
that
i
should
protect
her
from
any
brutish
thing
and
the
diskos
in
my
hand
and
afterward
an
horrid
time
of
waiting
and
the
stink
of
that
part
of
the
gorge
grew
very
dreadful
so
that
it
did
be
as
that
we
should
not
breathe
with
the
horror
of
the
stink
and
there
went
past
us
some
horrid
and
utter
monster
that
made
neither
sound
nor
anything
save
that
there
seemed
a
strange
noise
that
might
be
the
breathing
of
a
great
thing
but
yet
did
be
all
uncertain
in
that
the
sides
of
the
gorge
cast
the
sound
this
way
and
that
in
an
horrid
whispering
of
echoes
so
that
we
did
not
know
whether
the
sound
be
made
nigh
to
us
or
afar
upward
in
the
eternity
of
the
night
where
i
did
suppose
the
mountains
to
be
joined
over
the
gorge
in
a
monstrous
roof
in
that
part
and
presently
the
strange
noisings
died
in
the
upward
height
and
all
about
us
and
the
utter
disgust
of
the
stink
went
from
us
so
that
we
knew
that
the
monster
had
gone
past
us
and
did
make
downward
through
the
dark
gorge
and
mayhap
then
to
some
lone
and
dreadful
cavern
of
the
world
as
i
did
think
and
indeed
as
i
do
mind
i
had
a
sudden
wonder
at
that
time
and
other
whiles
as
it
did
chance
whether
this
way
did
be
truly
the
olden
way
that
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
refuge
did
travel
in
the
olden
days
and
surely
as
i
did
suppose
they
had
come
some
other
way
or
the
gorge
to
be
different
and
less
dreadful
in
the
faroff
years
and
this
thing
you
shall
agree
with
me
to
be
a
reasonable
thinking
and
after
that
the
monster
had
gone
a
good
while
we
went
onward
again
and
with
a
great
caution
and
dreading
alway
lest
that
we
come
upon
that
monster
in
the
darkness
but
yet
did
we
know
by
smell
and
by
all
our
consciousness
whether
that
we
came
nigh
unto
one
of
the
monster
slugs
then
in
the
end
of
the
fifth
hour
in
the
dark
part
of
the
gorge
we
came
by
the
mouth
of
that
great
cavern
upon
our
left
and
you
to
remember
the
same
and
i
made
pause
in
the
darkness
and
had
the
maid
very
gentle
by
the
arm
that
she
should
look
with
me
and
i
whispered
how
that
i
past
this
place
to
my
right
upon
mine
upward
way
and
how
that
i
did
think
there
to
be
aplenty
of
monster
caverns
within
the
mountains
that
made
the
sides
of
the
gorge
and
that
mayhap
the
slugcreatures
had
there
an
home
in
such
places
or
came
up
it
might
be
from
some
utter
strange
deepness
and
mystery
of
the
great
world
and
the
maid
did
bide
very
close
unto
me
and
silent
whilst
that
i
whispered
for
the
terror
of
the
place
did
be
on
her
yet
not
to
make
her
lacking
of
courage
but
yet
to
put
a
monstrous
awe
upon
her
and
a
great
and
natural
fear
and
i
likewise
as
you
do
know
and
we
stayed
there
where
we
did
be
a
little
moment
and
looked
downward
into
the
bowels
of
the
monster
cavern
and
the
shine
of
the
firehole
beat
over
the
cavern
in
the
near
part
but
there
did
be
an
utter
mystery
and
deathly
dark
beyond
the
shining
of
the
pit
that
did
be
within
as
you
shall
remember
and
in
verity
as
we
stayed
but
to
glance
i
perceived
that
there
lay
humped
things
about
the
fire
and
some
to
be
blackseeming
and
some
to
have
a
seeming
of
whiteness
but
with
no
sureness
in
the
colour
to
mine
eyes
and
there
came
a
moving
in
one
of
the
humpt
things
so
that
it
did
be
as
that
an
hill
did
wake
unto
an
horrid
life
and
immediately
i
knew
that
the
humps
did
be
some
utter
monsters
mayhaps
even
the
great
slugs
aslumber
about
the
firepit
that
did
burn
in
that
strange
deeply
cavern
and
i
saw
that
i
did
ill
for
our
lives
that
i
should
pause
even
for
a
little
moment
to
such
staring
and
immediately
i
whispered
to
mine
own
that
we
go
with
all
our
speed
for
indeed
i
knew
not
whether
that
our
nearness
had
waked
that
monster
or
whether
that
it
had
but
waked
by
chance
and
truly
i
was
utter
eager
that
we
be
gone
from
that
place
so
swift
as
we
might
and
we
went
on
then
through
all
of
the
sixth
hour
that
we
did
be
in
the
slug
part
of
the
gorge
as
i
named
it
unto
myself
and
in
all
that
hour
there
did
nothing
harmful
come
anigh
only
as
i
did
know
presently
there
came
an
unease
upon
our
spirits
but
yet
to
be
very
little
at
that
time
and
we
to
be
scarce
knowing
of
it
and
alway
as
we
went
there
did
be
darkness
for
the
most
and
oddwhiles
a
vague
murmuring
of
the
night
far
above
as
it
did
seem
and
presently
the
dull
glare
of
a
firepit
to
shine
out
far
off
below
us
in
the
gorge
and
to
seem
very
dim
and
unreal
unto
us
by
reason
of
the
smokes
and
the
fumes
that
made
a
haze
and
a
distaste
in
the
gorge
and
presently
the
murmuring
of
the
night
to
grow
somewhat
and
afterward
the
sound
of
the
muttering
of
the
firepit
to
come
unto
us
and
the
murmuring
to
die
unto
our
ears
that
did
be
hearing
now
only
the
dull
muttering
and
so
we
to
know
that
the
murmuring
of
the
night
did
be
truly
the
faroff
muttering
of
the
fireholes
and
our
eyes
to
guide
our
hearing
and
our
reason
to
explain
and
knit
the
sounds
and
so
we
to
pass
by
the
firehole
with
a
great
quiet
and
caution
and
ever
with
watchfulness
as
you
shall
suppose
and
afterward
again
into
the
dark
and
presently
again
the
murmuring
to
tell
that
we
came
unto
another
of
the
firepits
that
was
yet
afar
off
in
the
gorge
and
made
dim
echoes
in
the
night
and
alway
we
went
very
watchful
and
in
grim
fear
but
with
steadfastness
and
good
intention
to
win
forth
out
of
that
desolation
and
horror
and
having
alway
so
great
a
speed
as
the
darkness
and
the
dangers
and
the
trouble
of
the
way
did
allow
and
in
this
place
i
will
make
explanation
why
that
i
speak
somewhiles
of
firepits
and
otherwhiles
of
fireholes
for
the
holes
did
be
those
fires
that
burned
nigh
to
the
brim
of
the
holes
but
the
pits
were
those
places
where
the
fire
was
deeply
in
the
earth
and
this
thing
i
give
for
your
enlightenment
even
on
a
small
matter
so
that
you
shall
have
a
clear
knowledge
to
abide
with
me
all
the
way
and
you
to
agree
of
this
for
wisdom
and
i
to
be
pleased
that
you
so
agree
and
here
also
i
should
tell
that
there
did
not
come
a
muttering
from
all
of
the
fireholes
and
the
firepits
but
mayhap
from
this
one
and
mayhap
not
from
that
one
according
to
the
way
of
the
fire
therein
and
this
shall
be
plain
unto
you
and
so
shall
you
see
us
go
and
the
smoke
and
the
bitterness
of
the
sulphur
to
be
all
about
us
and
oddwhiles
the
murmuring
of
a
faroff
pit
and
oft
the
utter
silence
and
to
pass
this
time
a
lonesome
firehole
and
afterward
the
utter
dark
or
the
halfgloom
all
as
might
chance
according
to
the
nearness
of
the
fires
and
upward
in
the
everlasting
night
the
grim
mountains
to
make
a
roof
over
us
as
i
did
suppose
and
all
this
while
did
the
unease
of
which
i
have
told
make
upon
us
so
that
presently
mine
own
whispered
unto
me
the
thing
that
already
my
spirit
did
half
to
perceive
that
there
came
after
us
through
the
night
some
harmful
thing
that
did
be
surely
no
great
way
off
as
i
did
feel
within
me
and
the
maid
to
have
a
likeways
belief
and
truly
i
thought
at
once
upon
that
brute
that
did
wake
downward
in
the
mighty
cavern
where
did
be
the
great
inward
firehole
as
i
have
told
but
whether
this
did
be
true
knowledge
that
we
did
be
chased
in
the
dark
by
that
thing
or
whether
there
came
after
us
some
other
monster
i
could
have
no
sureness
but
only
that
we
did
be
chased
and
of
this
i
had
assuredness
and
i
set
the
maid
before
me
that
i
have
myself
ready
to
the
danger
that
followed
and
we
made
forward
again
then
so
quick
as
we
were
abled
and
she
went
very
wisely
for
she
had
good
wit
and
had
noted
the
ways
of
my
leading
and
we
went
thus
until
the
end
of
the
seventh
hour
and
surely
in
that
time
we
heard
the
murmuring
in
the
night
which
told
of
a
firehole
somewise
before
us
and
soon
to
have
the
red
glare
plain
to
our
eyes
and
the
noise
of
the
murmuring
to
die
away
into
the
nearer
mutter
of
the
fire
and
so
presently
to
be
anigh
and
we
to
make
forward
with
a
good
speed
because
that
we
feared
utterly
the
thing
that
made
quiet
chase
of
us
through
the
night
and
oft
i
did
look
backward
and
smelt
the
air
that
i
know
whether
it
did
be
a
monster
slugbeast
that
chased
us
but
there
did
be
no
worseness
of
the
smell
to
tell
me
aught
and
alway
i
did
be
fretted
in
the
heart
that
we
could
make
no
greater
speed
but
indeed
as
you
shall
perceive
our
going
did
be
but
a
slow
thing
in
the
dark
places
and
even
thus
we
had
many
a
sore
tumbling
and
bruising
and
by
this
we
were
come
almost
unto
the
firehole
and
immediately
i
saw
that
i
knew
the
place
for
there
went
upward
beside
the
fire
a
great
jaggedness
of
rock
that
i
had
seen
upon
mine
upward
way
and
surely
i
caught
the
maid
in
an
instant
and
bent
her
and
she
quick
to
obey
with
her
body
and
we
were
both
immediately
hid
downward
among
the
boulders
and
this
i
did
because
i
minded
how
that
there
did
be
many
of
the
monsters
nigh
to
this
same
firehole
as
i
did
go
upon
mine
upward
way
and
we
went
forward
then
with
an
utter
care
but
yet
to
keep
onward
because
that
there
did
be
somewhat
in
chase
of
us
and
in
verity
when
that
we
were
come
opposite
unto
the
firehole
i
saw
that
there
did
be
seven
of
the
monster
slugs
against
the
far
side
of
the
gorge
and
did
be
all
set
upon
their
bellies
against
the
cliff
and
their
horrid
heads
to
be
hid
in
the
upward
dark
and
their
tails
to
lie
very
great
and
softseeming
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
upon
the
boulders
and
lo
the
maid
toucht
me
and
she
drew
me
to
look
upon
the
near
cliff
of
the
gorge
and
truly
there
did
be
three
of
the
brutish
things
laid
upward
there
and
a
fourth
did
be
humped
somewhat
upon
a
great
ledge
that
did
be
upward
of
the
gorge
and
just
to
be
plain
to
our
eyes
and
surely
it
was
as
that
we
did
be
all
surround
by
such
monsters
and
to
make
the
heart
sink
and
fear
to
lie
upon
our
hopefulness
but
indeed
the
maid
showed
a
good
spirit
and
i
to
have
fierce
determining
that
we
come
free
of
that
gorge
and
afterward
in
time
unto
our
mighty
home
and
we
made
forward
again
and
did
go
creeping
among
the
rocks
and
the
boulders
and
so
came
presently
past
that
place
and
had
not
waked
the
monsters
if
that
indeed
they
did
truly
sleep
and
i
made
halt
a
moment
upon
the
far
border
of
the
light
from
the
firehole
and
i
lookt
backward
up
the
gorge
perchance
that
i
should
see
the
thing
that
followed
us
but
indeed
there
came
nothing
out
of
the
dark
of
the
upward
gorge
so
that
i
knew
that
there
did
be
some
safe
space
to
our
backs
which
did
be
truly
a
comforting
thing
and
here
i
should
tell
how
that
there
was
no
great
stinking
in
that
place
where
did
be
so
many
of
the
slugbeasts
and
this
to
puzzle
me
and
in
the
end
to
make
me
think
that
some
of
those
horrid
things
did
stench
more
great
than
others
but
yet
i
to
have
no
certainty
in
this
matter
as
you
do
perceive
and
truly
this
thing
troubled
me
for
i
had
been
comforted
that
my
nose
should
tell
me
when
that
the
thing
that
made
chase
of
us
should
draw
nigh
in
the
darkness
and
now
in
verity
i
knew
not
what
to
have
for
assurance
for
the
awaredness
of
the
spirit
was
but
a
vague
thing
and
no
more
in
such
a
matter
than
a
feeling
as
of
an
inward
warning
and
we
went
onward
then
for
a
great
hour
and
with
an
horrid
unease
upon
us
and
thrice
we
did
go
by
firepits
in
the
darkness
and
alway
i
made
pause
upon
the
far
side
of
the
light
that
i
should
look
backward
but
did
have
no
sight
of
aught
yet
did
my
spirit
or
my
fears
warn
me
with
new
fear
and
a
greater
sense
of
nearness
and
the
maid
to
confess
also
to
this
thing
now
we
saw
not
any
of
the
slugs
for
a
long
while
neither
had
there
been
any
about
the
three
fireholes
and
the
air
of
the
gorge
was
grown
something
sweet
and
free
somewhat
of
the
stench
of
deadseeming
things
but
yet
to
be
very
bitter
with
fumings
and
smoke
and
sulphur
stinks
and
lo
in
the
middle
of
the
tenth
hour
as
we
did
go
painful
and
with
anxiousness
in
a
very
dark
place
of
the
gorge
there
came
unto
us
again
the
smell
that
told
to
us
that
one
of
the
monsters
did
be
anigh
and
surely
we
had
both
a
great
fear
in
that
we
had
belief
that
it
did
be
a
sign
that
the
thing
that
made
chase
did
draw
near
upon
us
but
yet
did
i
to
use
my
reason
also
and
to
know
that
the
stink
might
be
from
some
monster
that
we
were
come
nigh
to
in
the
darkness
of
that
place
and
i
whispered
this
unto
the
maid
and
she
to
say
very
husht
that
it
might
be
so
but
to
have
no
belief
and
i
to
be
likewise
as
you
do
see
and
we
pusht
forward
at
a
new
speed
and
had
many
bitter
falls
so
that
we
did
be
all
bruised
but
not
to
know
it
at
that
time
because
that
our
fear
did
be
so
keen
and
oft
we
made
a
little
pause
and
harkt
but
there
did
be
only
the
dismal
drip
of
water
from
on
high
and
presently
the
murmur
of
the
night
that
told
that
we
drew
near
unto
a
new
firepit
and
surely
this
was
a
great
easement
to
our
spirits
in
that
we
should
have
light
to
perceive
our
danger
and
mayhap
to
win
free
but
to
be
in
that
utter
dark
was
a
thing
to
break
the
courage
and
to
breed
belief
that
we
did
be
utter
helpless
and
all
wrapt
in
horror
and
despair
and
the
stink
grew
ever
as
we
made
forward
so
that
i
knew
not
whether
there
did
be
great
monsters
beside
the
firepit
that
was
to
our
front
as
i
have
told
or
whether
it
made
plain
the
advancing
of
the
pursuer
and
we
only
to
be
able
to
make
our
best
speed
and
to
be
weary
with
hope
that
we
rush
not
blind
into
death
and
alway
to
be
chilled
in
the
back
with
the
belief
that
the
thing
that
made
chase
did
be
very
close
in
that
utter
dark
and
to
gain
upon
us
and
we
knew
not
whether
to
make
our
belief
to
be
the
tellings
of
the
spirit
or
the
utterings
of
our
fears
and
so
shall
you
perceive
our
plight
and
we
but
to
be
able
to
make
forward
and
in
verity
the
dreadfulness
of
that
time
doth
shake
me
now
to
think
upon
and
you
also
if
that
you
have
gotten
my
tellings
to
your
hearts
so
that
your
human
sympathy
doth
be
with
me
and
there
came
presently
to
our
ears
the
far
mutter
of
the
firepit
so
that
very
soon
the
murmuring
was
lost
to
us
in
the
night
and
only
the
slow
mutter
to
be
plain
and
the
dull
looming
of
the
fire
shone
afar
off
through
the
night
and
the
smoke
and
fumings
and
we
to
a
great
speed
and
to
pant
with
fear
but
yet
with
a
freshness
of
hope
again
to
sweeten
us
and
we
came
nigh
to
the
firepit
and
lo
the
smell
did
be
grown
very
drear
and
foul
but
there
did
be
no
slugbeast
near
the
fire
and
by
this
we
perceived
that
we
did
be
truly
in
an
utter
danger
in
that
the
pursuer
did
be
upon
us
and
the
stinking
to
tell
this
to
be
truth
and
our
spirits
to
have
warned
us
very
strong
and
proper
and
i
stopt
near
to
the
firepit
which
did
be
great
and
very
redglowing
and
i
lookt
upward
of
the
gorge
into
the
night
of
the
gorge
that
we
did
come
from
but
the
monster
was
not
yet
upon
us
to
work
our
death
and
i
lookt
to
the
sides
of
the
gorge
and
the
maid
to
have
the
same
thought
that
did
be
mine
that
we
climb
the
mountains
that
made
the
sides
of
the
gorge
and
i
lookt
very
keen
first
to
this
side
and
then
did
run
overward
that
i
look
more
close
upon
the
other
and
afterward
back
again
for
it
did
seem
that
we
should
have
a
greater
ease
upon
the
side
that
we
did
be
and
i
askt
the
maid
whether
that
she
did
be
prepared
and
she
to
be
very
white
and
wearied
and
all
besmirched
with
the
dankness
and
growths
upon
the
boulders
and
the
hidden
pools
of
the
gorge
and
the
dripping
of
the
waters
but
yet
did
she
be
sound
in
her
courage
and
to
show
that
she
had
all
belief
and
abiding
in
me
and
her
judgement
likewise
to
be
with
mine
in
that
her
own
reason
did
approve
and
i
took
the
bundle
of
her
torn
clothing
from
her
for
it
did
be
at
her
girdle
and
like
to
trouble
her
movings
but
she
to
refuse
very
determined
in
that
i
did
be
already
overburdened
and
i
to
be
firm
in
my
deciding
and
to
make
her
to
yield
the
bundle
the
which
i
hookt
unto
the
hold
of
the
diskos
where
it
did
be
to
mine
hip
and
the
maid
to
be
there
a
little
figure
and
white
in
the
face
and
strangely
angered
and
her
anger
mixt
with
hidden
acknowledgement
that
i
did
be
her
master
and
half
to
be
minded
that
she
move
not
from
where
she
did
stand
and
part
to
be
reasonable
and
fearful
of
the
hidden
beast
and
in
part
also
to
thrill
in
her
womanhood
unto
the
man
that
did
be
so
masterful
unto
her
and
all
to
pass
in
a
little
moment
and
we
to
be
to
the
gorge
side
and
busied
very
eager
to
the
climb
and
the
maid
to
be
first
as
i
did
heed
and
i
to
follow
and
have
constant
looking
to
the
task
and
to
her
safety
and
alway
to
be
bitter
anxious
for
our
speed
to
be
good
and
to
be
anxious
the
more
then
lest
that
mine
own
should
slip
for
there
did
be
an
horrid
wetness
upon
the
sides
of
the
gorge
as
you
shall
have
guessed
and
horrid
growths
that
blotched
the
great
rocks
mightily
and
made
an
utter
slipperiness
if
that
they
did
be
trod
upon
and
we
to
have
to
come
so
clear
of
all
such
matters
as
we
might
and
yet
to
be
speedy
for
our
lives
and
likewise
to
lack
no
care
and
thought
to
the
setting
of
our
hands
and
of
our
feet
in
places
fitted
to
the
lifting
of
our
weight
and
truly
you
shall
see
that
we
went
very
desperate
and
i
to
give
word
to
the
maid
that
she
look
not
downward
the
which
i
was
urgent
upon
lest
that
she
come
giddy
in
the
heart
but
i
as
you
shall
think
could
scarce
to
keep
from
fearful
peerings
below
so
that
i
learn
speedy
whether
the
pursuer
did
come
yet
into
the
light
of
the
firehole
beneath
and
presently
the
maid
did
gasp
very
weak
and
troubled
with
the
soreness
of
the
climb
and
i
came
higher
and
set
mine
arm
about
her
as
we
did
be
there
upon
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
she
stopt
very
still
a
little
while
and
an
ease
did
come
to
her
and
an
assurance
of
safety
and
surely
i
kist
her
there
where
we
did
be
in
that
upward
place
and
her
lips
did
tremble
unto
mine
and
her
courage
and
strength
to
come
back
into
her
so
that
in
a
minute
she
did
make
once
more
to
the
climbing
and
we
came
presently
to
a
place
where
a
great
ledge
did
be
that
jutted
out
from
the
mighty
cliff
and
was
surely
a
huge
way
above
the
gorge
bottom
and
the
ledge
sloped
and
there
were
on
the
ledge
great
stones
and
boulders
that
did
make
lodgement
there
through
eternity
and
i
lookt
very
careful
to
our
way
and
saw
that
we
did
be
in
the
path
of
a
mighty
rock
that
was
overnigh
unto
the
edge
of
the
shelfplace
and
did
put
fear
upon
me
in
that
it
seemed
that
it
should
come
down
with
great
thundering
upon
us
if
that
we
but
shook
the
place
where
it
did
be
and
i
caught
the
maid
very
swift
and
gentle
and
shaped
our
path
unto
one
side
of
that
great
rock
and
did
presently
lose
my
fear
when
that
we
did
come
safe
from
under
it
and
in
a
minute
after
we
were
come
upward
upon
the
ledge
and
a
very
safe
place
it
did
seem
and
surely
as
that
no
monster
should
be
abled
to
come
upward
upon
us
and
this
i
did
try
to
make
for
comfort
unto
ourselves
but
that
we
both
to
know
how
that
the
great
slugs
could
lie
up
against
the
sides
of
the
gorge
and
surely
it
did
be
like
that
they
should
be
able
to
come
upward
clear
of
the
gorge
and
so
to
the
place
where
we
made
to
have
safety
and
i
had
no
thought
to
deny
this
thing
when
that
it
was
clear
to
my
brain
but
set
rather
that
we
should
have
some
way
to
fight
the
monster
if
that
we
did
be
discovered
and
i
thought
in
a
moment
upon
the
stones
that
did
be
about
and
the
maid
in
the
same
moment
cried
out
that
we
should
push
the
big
rock
down
upon
the
slug
that
we
believed
to
have
chase
of
us
and
indeed
the
rock
to
be
a
great
weapon
if
we
could
but
stir
it
as
you
shall
think
and
alway
as
we
talked
very
hushed
we
lookt
downward
into
the
deepness
of
the
gorge
unto
the
upward
end
of
the
firelight
but
there
came
no
thing
yet
unto
our
knowledge
only
that
the
stinking
did
rise
up
to
us
through
that
great
distance
and
the
firepit
to
seem
now
a
very
small
burning
and
to
give
no
great
light
up
to
us
and
we
neither
to
be
abled
to
see
very
clear
of
the
gorge
bottom
in
that
the
haze
of
the
fumes
and
the
smoke
was
in
the
air
of
the
gorge
and
made
uncertainty
and
we
to
be
nowise
proper
free
of
the
smoke
even
where
we
did
be
and
we
watched
very
set
with
anxiousness
and
fearful
expecting
of
the
monster
and
did
be
both
yet
lost
of
breath
and
the
maid
that
she
made
her
words
something
broken
for
a
little
while
and
lo
in
a
moment
naani
cried
out
very
low
and
sharp
that
the
thing
did
come
and
i
to
see
a
moving
of
somewhat
in
the
same
instant
in
the
gorge
that
lay
upon
the
upward
side
of
the
firepit
and
immediately
i
saw
the
great
and
monster
head
of
the
beast
come
forward
into
the
shine
from
the
pit
and
the
head
did
be
of
a
blotched
white
and
to
have
the
eyes
upon
great
stalks
that
came
from
the
forward
part
of
the
head
and
the
stalks
to
be
set
downward
so
that
the
eyes
lookt
upon
the
bottom
parts
of
the
gorge
and
surely
this
doth
be
very
horridseeming
to
the
mind
of
this
age
but
yet
to
have
a
less
strangeness
unto
the
two
of
us
that
had
seen
many
horrid
sights
as
you
do
know
and
as
the
monster
came
forward
the
more
into
the
light
i
saw
that
the
great
and
utter
mighty
bulk
did
be
all
of
that
same
whiteness
that
did
be
so
set
over
with
blotchings
and
a
seeming
of
unhealth
but
truly
the
colour
was
proper
to
a
creature
that
did
abide
in
so
great
a
darkness
as
you
shall
say
yet
had
those
slugs
that
we
did
see
been
black
and
shining
for
the
most
as
i
have
told
and
this
to
be
as
i
saw
and
i
not
to
heed
here
that
i
try
unto
explainings
in
this
place
else
should
i
be
never
eased
of
my
task
as
you
do
see
and
the
monster
slug
came
onward
and
as
it
did
go
it
set
the
stalks
of
the
eyes
in
among
the
boulders
as
that
it
did
search
swayed
now
this
way
and
now
that
way
from
side
to
side
of
the
gorge
and
alway
it
pushed
the
stalks
of
the
eyes
inward
among
the
boulders
and
so
to
go
forward
searching
and
truly
it
was
very
dreadful
to
see
the
thing
make
search
for
us
and
to
go
so
steadfast
to
so
dread
a
purpose
and
indeed
i
saw
it
not
so
plain
as
might
be
because
of
the
haze
of
the
fumes
and
the
smoke
that
did
lie
in
the
air
of
the
gorge
as
i
have
told
and
made
something
vague
the
sight
at
this
time
and
that
but
yet
we
did
both
see
a
strange
thing
for
when
that
the
great
white
body
did
be
come
half
into
the
light
the
slugbeast
set
out
a
big
tongue
among
the
boulders
after
that
it
did
peer
thereunder
and
the
tongue
did
be
very
long
and
white
and
something
thinseeming
and
the
monster
lapped
inward
in
a
moment
a
great
snake
from
among
the
boulders
and
the
tongue
did
hold
upon
the
snake
as
that
there
did
be
surely
teeth
or
roughness
upon
the
tongue
but
yet
the
distance
to
be
too
great
for
any
surety
of
the
sight
as
you
do
know
and
moreover
there
did
be
the
uncertainty
of
the
haze
within
the
air
and
the
slug
took
the
snake
inward
all
as
it
did
lash
and
wriggle
and
swallowed
it
in
a
moment
and
in
verity
that
snake
did
be
a
big
and
horrid
creature
else
had
it
been
not
so
plain
to
our
sight
but
it
did
be
as
a
worm
unto
the
monster
and
gone
instant
and
immediately
the
slugbeast
went
again
to
searching
and
the
head
to
sway
from
this
side
unto
that
side
of
the
gorge
and
by
the
wideness
and
ease
of
this
swaying
shall
you
perceive
the
utter
greatness
of
the
beast
and
alway
as
it
did
come
downward
of
the
gorge
it
thrust
the
stalks
of
the
eyes
inward
among
the
boulders
looking
all
ways
and
oft
the
breath
did
come
from
it
as
a
cloud
and
the
stink
to
rise
up
unto
us
very
plain
and
an
abomination
and
again
we
saw
the
beast
set
the
tongue
in
among
the
boulders
of
the
gorge
bottom
and
it
lickt
forth
a
snake
that
did
seem
so
thick
as
a
man
in
the
body
and
the
snake
to
thrash
in
the
great
white
tongue
and
to
be
immediately
drawn
inward
and
gone
utter
and
surely
as
the
thought
did
stir
in
me
there
did
be
a
great
mercy
over
us
in
that
we
did
not
die
by
such
a
serpent
in
some
dark
and
horrid
place
of
the
gorge
but
yet
as
it
is
like
to
be
mayhap
the
snakes
did
be
only
anigh
to
the
fireholes
yet
doth
it
be
anywise
a
wondrous
thing
that
we
had
come
so
free
of
them
alway
and
truly
to
learn
was
to
be
given
a
new
terror
now
the
monster
was
come
fully
into
the
shining
of
the
firepit
and
was
upon
this
side
and
the
fire
to
make
a
shining
against
the
side
of
the
slug
so
that
odd
whiles
i
did
perceive
very
plain
the
huge
wrinklings
and
musclings
of
the
skin
as
the
beast
made
onward
and
alway
it
did
search
thrusting
in
the
eyestalks
among
the
boulders
and
sudden
it
made
pause
and
did
begin
that
it
brought
all
the
mighty
body
together
and
humpt
itself
and
brought
the
headpart
round
unto
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
that
made
this
side
of
the
gorge
and
it
gathered
itself
and
afterward
did
lengthen
upward
against
the
cliff
and
begin
to
climb
and
lo
i
saw
that
the
beast
did
scent
of
us
and
made
to
come
upward
to
destroy
us
and
as
the
mighty
hill
of
the
body
did
come
into
length
against
the
great
cliffside
the
beast
set
the
eyestalks
into
this
cave
and
that
as
it
did
go
and
into
all
crannies
and
so
lengthened
upward
very
straight
and
monstrous
and
dreadful
unto
us
and
did
be
as
a
white
and
mildewed
hill
that
had
an
horrid
life
and
the
stink
to
come
up
so
that
we
did
be
like
to
lose
our
breath
with
the
dreadfulness
of
it
as
you
shall
think
and
surely
for
a
moment
i
looked
unto
the
rocks
upon
the
ledge
and
this
way
and
that
way
and
upward
unto
the
everlasting
darkness
that
did
be
above
us
and
again
unto
the
great
rock
that
did
seem
to
quiver
upon
the
edge
as
i
have
told
and
i
was
grown
utter
desperate
in
a
moment
for
truly
it
did
seem
in
that
instant
that
there
did
be
no
power
in
the
world
that
should
slay
so
utter
mighty
a
monster
and
immediately
even
as
i
did
despair
i
had
run
very
swift
unto
the
great
rock
and
the
maid
with
me
both
very
strained
and
shaken
with
the
horror
of
the
thing
that
did
make
upward
unto
us
so
sure
and
intent
and
i
set
my
strength
unto
the
rock
and
heaved
but
indeed
the
rock
gave
not
from
the
place
where
it
did
be
so
that
i
had
a
dreadful
despair
for
i
saw
that
it
did
be
more
secure
than
had
seemed
and
the
maid
lent
her
strength
unto
mine
and
we
heaved
together
with
sore
pantings
and
little
cries
to
guide
our
endeavours
and
because
we
could
not
be
contained
in
that
moment
and
surely
it
seemed
that
the
great
rock
moved
and
lo
as
we
strove
together
to
the
task
there
came
a
vast
and
sudden
grinding
and
the
rock
to
cease
from
our
shoulders
and
to
be
gone
from
us
or
scarce
we
did
wot
of
the
happening
and
the
rock
went
over
and
rushed
downward
upon
the
monster
and
with
mighty
crashings
as
it
did
grind
and
crush
the
face
of
the
cliffside
with
a
quick
and
constant
thundering
and
i
caught
the
maid
as
she
did
stagger
upon
that
dire
upward
edge
because
that
she
had
set
her
strength
so
utter
to
the
endeavour
and
the
rock
to
be
gone
so
sudden
as
you
do
see
and
she
to
be
like
to
follow
after
and
she
clung
unto
me
and
i
to
hold
her
very
safe
as
i
lookt
down
upon
the
falling
of
the
rock
and
behold
the
great
rock
smote
the
monster
in
the
humpt
part
of
the
back
below
of
the
head
and
did
enter
into
the
monster
even
as
a
bullet
doth
strike
and
was
gone
instant
from
my
sight
into
the
vitals
and
there
came
a
mighty
sound
of
anguish
from
the
monster
and
the
monster
did
loosen
from
the
cliff
and
to
crumple
as
it
did
seem
and
sink
backward
and
a
great
steam
of
dread
breathing
to
go
upward
from
the
beast
and
a
reek
and
it
made
again
the
strange
and
horrid
noise
of
pain
and
the
gorge
to
be
yet
full
of
the
echoes
of
the
rock
thundering
and
with
the
noise
of
the
rock
there
was
now
mingled
the
horrid
sounding
of
the
deathcrying
of
the
beast
and
the
gorge
to
be
filled
with
dull
and
dreadful
echoings
as
that
an
hundred
monsters
died
in
this
place
and
that
of
the
darkness
in
the
gorge
and
all
to
be
bred
of
the
noise
of
that
mildewed
hill
adying
and
the
echoes
ceased
not
for
a
while
even
after
that
the
monster
did
be
utter
quiet
for
truly
they
came
presently
from
far
upward
and
downward
of
the
gorge
out
of
all
the
eternity
of
the
night
and
to
be
as
that
they
came
backward
very
faint
out
of
lonesome
miles
and
out
of
the
strange
deepness
of
unknown
caverns
of
the
world
and
so
in
the
end
to
silence
and
the
far
bottom
of
the
gorge
to
be
filled
with
a
white
and
horrid
hill
very
dreadful
and
that
did
yet
quiver
to
show
the
slowness
of
death
and
alway
a
dreadful
reek
and
stinking
to
fill
all
the
air
even
unto
the
height
as
of
the
grave
and
i
stood
upward
in
that
far
high
place
and
held
the
maid
very
strong
and
tender
and
she
to
have
covered
her
ears
from
that
dreadful
crying
and
to
be
yet
shaken
with
the
greatness
and
horror
of
the
dying
of
the
monster
and
the
nearness
that
she
did
come
unto
falling
as
you
have
seen
and
presently
she
came
less
to
tremble
and
did
weep
very
easeful
even
as
a
babe
doth
weep
and
i
mayhap
to
be
not
oversteady
as
you
shall
think
but
yet
to
have
a
great
gladness
set
in
my
heart
and
a
triumph
and
an
utter
grace
of
thankfulness
and
i
held
mine
own
very
tender
and
sure
as
i
did
say
and
she
very
soon
to
be
eased
of
her
trouble
and
the
shock
to
be
something
gone
from
her
and
she
lookt
up
at
me
and
slipt
her
arms
upward
about
my
neck
and
pulled
me
downward
unto
her
that
she
might
kiss
me
and
we
to
talk
then
of
the
going
down
and
surely
this
did
seem
a
great
and
dangerous
task
for
truly
we
had
come
upward
pretty
easy
in
the
excess
of
our
fear
but
how
we
might
go
down
with
our
blood
cool
i
did
be
all
in
doubt
yet
before
that
we
did
aught
else
i
led
the
maid
upward
on
to
the
safe
part
of
the
ledge
and
we
sat
there
very
quiet
and
weary
and
she
did
be
leaned
against
me
and
we
eat
each
of
us
two
of
the
tablets
and
i
to
scold
and
coax
mine
own
to
this
end
and
she
to
obey
and
to
be
better
afterward
because
that
she
had
eat
and
we
drank
some
of
the
water
and
did
rest
a
time
longer
and
presently
our
courage
and
strength
was
come
back
into
us
and
we
packt
the
scrip
again
and
the
maid
set
it
fast
to
my
back
and
we
went
then
to
the
edge
of
the
shelf
and
lookt
downward
this
way
and
that
and
surely
there
did
be
no
way
to
go
save
the
way
we
came
only
that
we
might
shape
our
downward
climbing
to
bring
us
a
little
below
that
place
where
the
dead
monster
did
be
and
i
saw
by
mine
own
heart
and
by
the
paleness
of
the
maid
that
we
should
do
well
that
we
consider
the
thing
no
more
but
make
to
the
task
and
i
went
immediately
over
the
edge
of
the
shelf
upon
my
belly
and
i
bade
naani
to
follow
and
we
began
then
that
we
go
downward
and
in
verity
we
went
downward
for
mayhap
a
great
hour
and
i
gave
help
alway
unto
mine
own
as
i
could
and
she
to
come
after
me
very
brave
and
made
that
she
hold
back
her
fear
and
come
downward
of
that
cliff
that
did
be
oft
like
to
a
mighty
wall
and
surely
even
as
we
came
down
i
marvelled
how
we
did
ever
go
upward
even
though
fear
did
aid
us
but
indeed
i
do
think
it
doth
be
easier
to
climb
safely
than
to
come
backward
for
this
is
how
i
have
found
and
we
made
rest
thrice
upon
ledges
of
the
cliff
and
afterward
came
downward
again
and
alway
very
slow
and
with
exceeding
heed
where
our
hands
and
our
feet
did
go
that
we
slip
not
suddenly
to
our
death
and
once
as
i
did
see
the
maid
was
lost
of
all
her
strength
and
did
be
going
to
fall
because
that
she
did
be
all
gone
into
a
sudden
weakness
of
the
head
in
an
instant
and
she
did
be
silent
even
in
that
moment
the
which
doth
be
marvellous
unto
me
and
to
give
me
a
strong
pride
of
her
as
you
shall
understand
if
that
ever
you
have
loved
and
surely
i
came
upward
in
a
moment
that
little
space
that
was
between
and
had
mine
arm
about
mine
own
very
swift
and
held
her
hard
and
fierce
against
the
cliff
and
this
i
did
that
she
should
feel
how
that
she
could
never
fall
and
immediately
her
strength
and
her
dear
courage
came
back
into
her
and
i
kist
her
there
against
the
mighty
cliff
and
afterward
she
did
have
power
again
to
come
downward
safe
and
presently
we
were
come
to
the
gorge
bottom
and
maybe
an
hundred
paces
down
the
gorge
from
that
place
where
did
be
the
dead
monster
all
sunk
into
an
ugly
and
horrid
heap
so
great
as
a
small
hill
and
a
dreadful
stinking
did
hang
in
all
that
part
of
the
gorge
by
reason
of
the
slug
and
signs
of
disgust
as
you
shall
think
and
the
great
and
mildewed
body
of
the
thing
yet
to
settle
and
twitch
as
i
did
look
as
it
did
come
properly
unto
death
in
all
that
mighty
bulk
and
everywhere
the
skin
of
the
beast
did
be
set
into
great
wrinklings
and
horrid
blotchings
to
be
upon
the
improper
whiteness
thereof
and
truly
i
did
be
in
haste
that
i
turn
the
maid
away
from
that
thing
and
that
we
haste
downward
of
the
gorge
and
we
went
then
for
two
good
hours
and
alway
i
did
hearten
the
maid
and
she
to
go
very
husht
and
trustful
by
me
but
truly
i
did
be
in
an
anguish
of
heart
because
that
i
was
newly
aware
that
there
did
be
such
great
and
dreadful
serpents
in
that
part
of
the
gorge
as
you
do
also
know
and
i
was
not
overfeared
for
myself
but
for
the
maid
that
did
have
no
armour
to
protect
her
dear
body
and
because
that
i
was
so
set
with
this
trouble
i
took
the
maid
presently
into
mine
arms
that
i
carry
her
and
so
to
have
her
clear
of
aught
that
should
lie
among
the
boulders
and
in
verity
mine
own
did
show
an
anger
very
surprising
and
determined
for
i
said
not
why
i
should
carry
herfearing
to
give
her
a
greater
uneasebut
only
that
she
did
be
weary
and
i
very
strong
and
willing
and
indeed
i
could
not
bring
her
to
reason
without
i
told
her
which
was
not
mine
intent
for
she
did
refuse
me
to
carry
her
and
said
that
truly
i
had
need
of
no
added
burden
unto
my
labours
and
when
she
saw
that
i
would
not
be
moved
by
her
reasonings
she
made
to
win
upon
me
by
her
loving
ways
but
indeed
i
only
kist
her
and
went
forward
with
her
in
mine
arms
and
she
half
naughty
that
i
did
be
so
heedless
of
her
wishings
and
somewise
hurt
also
and
so
to
be
silent
in
mine
arms
yet
mayhap
to
be
something
stirred
in
her
nature
that
i
did
be
steadfast
to
mine
intention
despite
that
her
will
did
be
contrary
and
this
i
do
believe
to
be
truth
because
that
afterward
i
do
think
that
she
lay
there
in
mine
arms
only
as
a
woman
that
doth
be
in
the
hands
of
her
master
that
hath
all
her
love
and
in
thiswise
we
went
forward
and
in
the
end
of
the
two
hours
that
we
did
go
there
was
come
the
end
of
the
dark
part
of
the
gorge
and
we
to
be
outward
of
that
mighty
roof
of
the
mountains
as
i
do
think
it
to
have
been
and
the
air
to
be
free
of
the
stink
of
the
monsters
and
the
fireholes
to
be
very
plenty
and
their
smokings
to
go
upward
very
proper
so
that
we
had
no
more
the
bitterness
of
their
fumings
in
our
throats
and
there
did
be
a
pretty
good
light
to
go
by
the
contrast
of
the
past
hours
and
i
set
mine
own
again
to
her
feet
and
made
that
she
keep
to
my
rearward
so
that
if
there
did
be
any
serpents
to
our
path
they
should
come
first
under
my
feet
and
thiswise
to
work
no
harm
to
me
because
of
mine
armour
neither
to
naani
mine
own
maid
now
by
this
time
it
was
somewhat
of
nineteen
great
hours
since
we
did
sleep
for
we
had
been
a
long
while
making
that
we
come
safe
from
the
slug
and
indeed
we
had
come
downward
with
a
less
speed
than
i
did
go
through
upon
mine
upward
way
as
you
shall
mind
and
this
to
be
that
mine
own
did
not
have
the
hard
strength
that
was
in
my
body
to
the
enduring
of
great
labour
and
stress
and
this
surely
all
to
be
plain
unto
you
that
have
been
with
me
in
all
my
journey
and
moreover
there
must
be
kept
to
mind
the
three
hours
that
we
had
gone
ere
we
were
come
proper
into
the
dark
part
of
the
gorge
and
so
all
to
be
remembered
unto
you
and
also
you
to
mind
that
we
did
be
wakeful
a
time
ere
that
we
set
forward
upon
that
days
journeying
and
we
did
go
almost
in
joyouswise
because
that
we
were
come
safe
out
of
that
dreadful
place
and
surely
odd
whiles
i
did
feel
the
hands
of
mine
own
naughty
one
to
be
hookt
very
pretty
and
sly
into
the
backward
part
of
my
belt
as
that
she
did
make
a
pretending
that
she
drive
me
before
her
and
surely
this
doth
be
a
strange
thing
to
tell
upon
for
there
did
be
no
knowledge
of
the
olden
horse
in
all
the
eternity
of
that
dark
world
but
yet
maybe
some
dear
olden
memorydream
did
set
her
hands
unconscious
to
this
pretty
work
and
in
verity
once
i
turned
very
sudden
and
had
her
swift
into
mine
arms
as
she
did
pretend
to
drive
me
and
she
to
laugh
with
a
sweet
and
joyous
gurgle
against
mine
armour
and
i
to
heed
that
i
hurt
her
not
because
i
did
be
like
an
iron
man
that
should
put
arms
about
a
tender
maid
and
we
lookt
alway
now
for
a
place
that
should
be
proper
to
our
rest
and
to
our
sleep
and
when
it
did
be
close
upon
the
end
of
the
twentieth
hour
of
that
journey
the
maid
showed
me
a
cave
that
was
mayhap
fifty
good
feet
upward
in
the
right
side
of
the
gorge
and
i
lookt
about
and
saw
that
there
did
be
two
fireholes
anigh
and
a
warm
spring
to
make
a
basin
of
water
that
did
lie
between
the
fires
and
all
very
well
set
to
our
need
as
i
did
perceive
for
indeed
we
did
be
utter
besmirched
with
the
filth
of
the
slug
part
of
the
gorge
and
to
need
that
we
be
nice
and
fitly
washed
before
that
we
have
any
comfort
of
our
selves
and
i
bade
naani
to
wait
a
little
minute
and
i
lookt
well
up
the
gorge
and
well
down
the
gorge
and
lo
there
did
be
no
thing
to
set
me
in
unease
and
i
told
mine
own
that
she
keep
a
sharp
and
steadfast
watching
and
not
to
heed
me
and
this
i
said
because
i
knew
she
did
be
like
otherwise
to
look
at
me
and
be
overanxious
as
i
go
upward
to
the
cave
and
indeed
she
to
be
better
anyway
in
watch
of
the
gorge
and
to
cry
out
to
me
if
that
anything
came
anigh
whilst
that
i
went
upward
and
i
made
upward
to
the
cave
and
was
come
there
pretty
quick
and
truly
it
did
be
good
for
our
purpose
and
freshseeming
and
dry
and
to
have
no
holes
that
i
could
see
for
the
hiding
of
creeping
things
and
i
called
down
gently
to
the
maid
that
the
cave
did
be
proper
and
she
to
show
her
gladness
and
to
be
looking
upward
at
me
instead
of
the
way
of
the
gorge
as
i
set
her
and
truly
she
did
be
a
dear
and
human
little
maid
and
utter
mine
so
that
i
did
find
a
new
joy
in
each
small
lack
of
wisdom
and
this
just
so
much
as
that
she
had
done
a
wondrous
proper
thing
and
truly
you
shall
say
there
was
some
properness
to
her
heart
in
that
she
could
abide
not
but
to
watch
me
and
i
went
quickly
down
to
mine
own
for
there
was
alway
an
unease
upon
me
save
when
i
did
be
nigh
to
her
in
chance
of
trouble
and
when
i
was
come
down
to
her
the
maid
did
be
seeming
a
little
in
thought
and
afterward
showed
me
how
that
she
did
be
all
in
a
pitiful
disgust
of
the
dirt
and
slime
and
the
drippings
of
the
gorge
that
did
be
on
her
and
had
made
her
garment
utter
wet
and
bemired
so
that
she
did
feel
that
her
very
body
was
a
repulse
unto
her
and
i
saw
how
it
did
be
with
naani
and
i
went
to
the
warm
pool
and
felt
that
it
did
be
not
overhot
and
afterward
found
the
deepness
by
the
handle
of
the
diskos
and
this
to
be
scarce
of
three
feet
and
the
water
very
clear
to
show
me
the
bottom
so
that
it
was
surely
a
nice
and
proper
place
to
be
for
such
a
purpose
as
i
did
think
and
i
set
some
of
the
water
to
my
mouth
using
my
hand
and
truly
there
did
seem
no
hurtful
chemical
in
the
water
and
therefore
was
i
eased
that
the
maid
should
have
the
desire
that
i
did
see
to
be
in
her
mind
and
i
saw
that
i
should
be
helpful
to
mine
own
if
that
i
make
the
arranging
of
things
to
be
in
mine
own
hands
and
i
went
back
unto
the
maid
and
told
her
that
the
pool
was
very
nice
to
be
for
a
bathplace
and
that
she
to
haste
to
wash
herself
whilst
the
gorge
did
be
free
of
any
creature
or
monster
now
i
saw
that
naani
was
troubled
and
feared
that
i
did
be
going
to
leave
her
and
yet
did
be
paused
a
little
in
her
words
to
show
me
all
that
she
did
wish
and
surely
i
stoopt
and
kist
her
as
she
did
look
so
wistful
in
her
little
puzzlement
and
immediately
i
removed
her
trouble
very
natural
and
told
that
i
should
stand
guard
anigh
to
her
the
while
that
she
bathed
and
truly
she
did
be
at
ease
on
the
moment
and
mayhap
something
surprised
to
know
wherefore
she
had
been
something
alack
to
ask
me
but
in
truth
it
did
be
very
natural
and
i
told
her
to
be
so
quick
as
she
might
which
was
a
needless
thing
to
say
yet
to
start
her
and
she
to
go
quietly
to
obey
me
but
first
to
take
the
cloak
out
of
the
hold
upon
my
shoulders
and
to
unfold
it
and
so
to
the
pool
and
i
to
stand
with
my
back
thatwards
and
to
lean
ready
upon
the
diskos
and
presently
she
did
be
in
the
water
as
i
knew
and
i
to
be
her
man
very
sure
and
gentle
to
her
and
sedate
and
truly
as
you
shall
think
i
did
love
that
i
be
to
stand
guard
to
her
in
her
dear
maidenhood
and
she
after
that
she
was
cheered
and
warmed
by
the
delight
of
the
water
to
sing
very
low
and
happy
to
herself
where
she
did
be
to
my
back
and
sudden
the
singing
to
cease
and
the
maid
screamed
and
i
to
have
no
thought
of
improper
modesty
but
turned
instant
to
the
maid
and
in
a
moment
i
saw
what
did
trouble
her
for
there
came
a
serpent
out
of
the
water
and
the
maid
to
be
all
adrift
with
natural
modesty
and
with
her
fear
of
the
serpent
and
i
was
come
into
the
pool
in
a
moment
in
mine
armour
and
did
lift
the
maid
naked
and
wet
into
mine
arms
and
had
her
instant
from
the
water
and
upon
the
side
of
the
pool
and
there
i
wrapt
the
cloak
about
her
and
ran
very
quick
and
killed
the
serpent
as
it
did
go
offwards
among
the
boulders
and
surely
it
did
be
so
thick
as
mine
arm
and
to
have
come
from
some
hole
that
did
be
hid
in
the
bottom
of
the
pool
and
i
came
back
then
to
mine
own
and
took
her
into
mine
arms
and
set
the
cloak
well
about
her
and
she
to
cry
and
to
tremble
with
the
shock
and
disturbance
of
the
thing
but
soon
to
be
eased
and
ready
to
laugh
with
me
and
so
she
was
come
proper
to
her
happiness
again
and
i
very
gentle
and
joyous
with
her
for
truly
my
heart
had
been
sick
that
she
had
come
so
nigh
to
that
horrid
danger
and
i
eased
the
scrip
from
me
and
opened
it
and
made
her
to
take
two
of
the
tablets
and
she
to
refuse
to
eat
save
i
company
her
also
and
indeed
i
did
be
very
willing
for
truly
my
belly
was
alway
empty
and
she
to
be
very
glad
to
eat
because
she
did
be
clean
now
and
to
have
no
more
disgust
of
herself
and
afterward
we
drank
some
of
the
water
and
soon
we
did
be
finished
and
she
to
ask
for
her
girdle
that
i
did
give
her
with
the
knife
as
i
have
surely
told
and
she
belted
the
cloak
very
graceful
about
her
and
lookt
very
dear
and
pretty
with
her
little
bare
feet
and
her
hair
very
lovely
upon
her
shoulders
for
she
did
wear
alway
in
the
gorge
the
lining
of
my
headpiece
and
so
had
her
hair
dry
and
sweet
and
in
verity
i
did
mind
now
how
that
she
did
look
very
beautiful
in
her
bath
as
i
had
gone
to
succour
her
from
the
snake
and
i
to
be
nicely
wholesome
in
this
remembering
because
of
my
love
but
yet
to
be
knowing
that
i
was
sweetly
stirred
to
new
things
and
did
not
know
before
that
a
maid
lookt
in
the
same
moment
so
holy
and
so
human
and
afterward
in
odd
whiles
i
remembered
but
never
to
think
overmuch
because
that
i
did
feel
inwardly
that
i
should
be
gently
wise
in
such
things
and
you
to
understand
my
heart
in
this
if
that
ever
you
have
loved
and
surely
the
maid
brought
me
from
my
dreamings
very
sensible
in
that
she
had
me
to
stand
and
she
was
gone
about
me
very
swift
and
natty
with
her
pretty
fingers
that
she
ease
me
of
mine
armour
and
afterward
she
bade
me
to
strip
and
wash
whilst
that
she
keep
watch
for
me
of
the
gorge
and
she
took
the
diskos
and
leaned
upon
it
very
brave
and
proper
but
yet
as
i
do
think
with
somewhat
of
roguishness
within
her
very
deep
hid
and
scarce
known
unto
herself
and
i
warned
her
to
be
very
wise
with
the
great
weapon
for
it
did
fit
only
to
fight
in
my
hands
and
did
be
like
to
cause
harm
to
any
that
should
meddle
with
it
or
make
to
use
it
save
me
and
naani
to
nod
that
she
did
hear
me
and
to
be
half
in
fear
of
the
thing
and
half
to
feel
that
it
did
be
friendly
to
her
and
so
to
stand
guard
for
me
and
truly
to
seem
a
very
sweet
and
slender
maid
despite
the
bigness
of
the
cloak
and
the
great
weapon
to
seem
more
great
in
her
small
hands
and
to
mind
me
how
strong
i
did
be
and
surely
you
shall
think
me
in
conceit
but
truly
i
did
be
glad
to
be
so
strong
and
a
proper
thing
for
pride
if
that
there
be
no
scorn
for
others
therein
and
you
to
agree
with
me
in
this
thing
or
to
be
lacking
of
sympathy
and
good
human
understanding
now
i
washt
me
not
by
going
down
into
the
pool
for
indeed
i
did
not
wot
whether
there
be
any
more
snakes
hid
there
in
some
other
hole
and
the
way
i
washt
was
that
i
dipt
my
headpiece
into
the
hot
pool
and
poured
the
water
over
me
and
rubbed
my
body
very
strong
with
my
hands
and
there
to
be
surely
some
certain
chemical
in
the
water
that
aided
mine
efforts
for
the
water
went
very
smooth
under
my
hands
and
when
i
was
done
i
washt
my
pocketcloth
very
speedy
in
the
pool
and
wrung
it
and
did
then
wipe
my
body
so
dry
as
i
should
and
afterward
i
wrung
the
cloth
again
and
set
it
about
my
loins
and
so
to
be
as
proper
as
i
might
and
i
did
call
to
the
maid
that
i
was
proper
and
she
to
come
then
and
kiss
me
and
she
gave
back
to
me
the
diskos
and
set
me
that
i
stand
anigh
to
the
nearer
firehole
and
so
to
be
that
i
should
guard
her
and
in
the
same
time
be
come
free
of
the
chill
of
the
gorge
which
was
not
great
in
that
place
and
surely
i
did
mean
that
i
help
her
but
she
would
have
no
help
in
her
work
that
she
did
say
to
be
her
glad
right
but
bade
me
that
i
to
mine
own
work
to
be
her
dear
protector
as
she
did
call
me
and
i
to
lift
that
wilful
one
into
mine
arms
a
moment
and
to
give
her
a
very
loving
hug
and
for
that
time
to
have
no
fear
that
i
harm
her
because
that
i
was
freed
of
the
hardness
of
the
armour
about
me
as
you
do
know
and
surely
she
to
feel
very
dear
and
pretty
in
mine
arms
and
she
kist
me
the
once
with
a
little
passion
of
love
and
immediately
to
want
to
go
from
me
so
that
i
freed
her
in
a
moment
as
was
ever
my
way
and
she
then
to
pause
a
small
space
off
from
me
and
lookt
at
me
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
and
half
to
put
out
her
arms
that
she
be
taken
again
into
mine
but
so
to
cease
ere
she
yield
to
her
heart
and
turned
from
me
immediately
to
the
task
of
the
washing
and
she
took
first
my
bodyvest
and
washt
it
very
quick
and
clever
in
the
pool
and
afterward
came
over
by
me
and
spread
it
upon
the
hot
flat
rock
anigh
to
the
firehole
and
she
got
then
my
change
bodyvest
from
the
bundle
of
her
torn
garments
where
she
did
put
it
to
be
washt
on
opportunity
even
as
now
and
mayhap
to
like
that
it
should
lie
in
her
bundle
with
her
own
garments
for
so
as
i
do
mind
the
thought
came
to
me
very
natural
but
she
to
say
naught
to
lead
me
thus
yet
to
be
a
very
honest
and
dear
maid
and
to
have
little
secret
ways
of
love
as
i
did
perceive
that
i
did
not
be
told
of
and
she
washt
the
second
bodyvest
and
set
it
to
dry
by
the
first
and
afterward
did
likewise
with
all
my
garments
and
came
then
to
the
washing
of
her
own
and
lo
as
she
spread
it
also
to
the
drying
there
came
to
mine
heart
that
the
maid
did
have
only
this
one
rough
and
thick
garment
that
did
be
the
armoursuit
as
i
have
told
and
surely
it
did
be
dreadful
that
she
have
the
hardness
of
that
strong
knitted
and
fibrous
garment
to
be
next
to
her
dear
body
and
i
to
be
in
comfort
with
the
softness
of
my
bodyvest
and
i
was
all
angered
in
a
moment
that
she
had
gone
thiswise
while
that
i
had
been
gentled
as
it
might
be
and
i
bade
naani
take
the
second
vest
to
her
own
use
when
it
did
be
dry
and
she
to
look
upward
from
where
she
did
turn
the
garments
upon
the
hot
rock
and
to
mean
in
the
first
to
deny
me
but
indeed
she
was
quick
to
see
that
i
did
be
truly
in
anger
and
mine
anger
to
come
because
that
i
was
hurt
that
this
did
be
and
because
that
i
was
shamed
that
she
had
gone
so
roughclad
the
while
that
i
had
no
thought
to
the
matter
and
moreover
because
that
she
had
known
her
lack
and
did
not
tell
me
of
the
thing
but
yet
i
did
have
a
great
tenderness
in
the
backward
part
of
mine
anger
because
that
i
perceived
all
the
unselfishness
and
delight
of
her
love
that
did
be
about
this
little
matter
as
you
shall
see
if
you
have
gone
alway
with
me
but
mine
anger
yet
to
be
something
hard
because
i
did
see
that
i
have
need
to
watch
the
maid
that
she
put
not
her
dear
body
to
pain
that
i
might
come
unknowing
to
some
little
pleasuring
or
ease
as
did
be
now
as
i
have
shown
and
truly
it
did
be
sweetly
done
in
love
but
to
be
somewise
lacking
of
judgement
and
so
shall
you
know
somewhat
of
the
way
that
i
did
be
angered
and
to
have
understanding
with
me
but
if
you
have
not
you
shall
think
it
to
be
naught
and
that
the
maid
did
need
only
that
she
be
kist
and
to
be
shaken
a
little
in
playfulness
and
warned
to
heed
that
i
did
be
earnest
and
mayhap
you
to
be
somewise
right
and
not
to
guess
far
off
from
the
inward
deepness
of
my
heart
but
yet
it
doth
be
verity
that
i
was
truly
angered
and
fit
to
shake
mine
own
and
in
the
same
moment
to
be
utter
tender
unto
her
and
surely
this
doth
be
all
a
contradiction
and
the
human
heart
to
be
a
wayward
thing
whether
it
doth
be
of
a
man
or
of
a
woman
and
naani
as
i
do
think
to
have
loved
the
chafe
of
that
rough
garment
for
loves
sake
and
to
go
very
humble
and
loving
as
i
lookt
at
her
but
in
verity
to
be
never
gone
from
the
sweet
naughtiness
that
did
be
alway
in
her
heart
and
to
plan
even
in
that
moment
some
new
and
secret
service
unto
me
that
should
be
for
her
quiet
joy
and
to
be
hid
from
me
until
that
my
wit
should
come
upon
it
to
uncover
it
and
in
verity
a
young
man
doth
want
that
he
whip
his
maid
and
kiss
her
and
all
in
the
one
moment
and
indeed
he
to
have
delight
in
both
and
she
obeyed
me
that
time
as
alway
when
i
did
be
earnest
without
more
word
and
surely
that
naughty
one
did
know
how
i
loved
her
and
the
maid
washt
then
her
torn
garments
that
did
be
in
the
bundle
and
had
gotten
soiled
by
the
slime
of
the
dark
part
of
the
gorge
and
she
put
these
to
dry
and
afterward
washed
mine
armour
and
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
the
cloakhold
and
all
such
matters
of
our
gear
and
so
to
be
presently
done
and
she
was
heedful
then
that
she
turned
the
garments
upon
the
hot
rock
and
afterward
did
attend
to
my
bruisings
and
when
she
did
rest
i
lookt
to
her
pretty
feet
and
rubbed
them
very
gentle
and
constant
with
the
ointment
and
surely
they
did
be
pretty
well
but
i
to
like
that
i
should
tend
them
and
to
have
joy
to
feel
their
littleness
within
my
palms
and
surely
she
did
know
how
it
did
be
with
me
for
presently
she
took
her
feet
inward
under
the
cloak
and
i
maybe
to
look
something
woeful
for
she
put
one
out
presently
when
that
i
did
the
least
expect
and
slipt
it
very
cosy
into
my
hand
and
surely
i
kist
her
naughty
toes
and
she
then
to
be
very
sedate
now
presently
when
naani
found
the
garments
to
be
proper
dry
she
gave
those
to
me
that
were
mine
and
bid
me
to
turn
my
back
and
be
drest
very
speedy
and
lo
in
a
little
time
when
i
was
nigh
done
she
came
over
and
stood
before
me
and
was
drest
again
in
the
armoursuit
and
to
look
very
slender
and
dainty
and
she
lookt
at
me
so
that
i
put
out
my
hands
that
i
kiss
her
but
she
went
from
me
very
proper
and
brought
mine
armour
and
gave
me
help
with
it
and
alway
very
grave
and
quiet
but
yet
to
have
naughtiness
underneath
as
i
did
believe
and
when
i
was
full
armed
she
took
my
hand
and
set
mine
arm
about
her
waist
and
she
leaned
her
head
against
my
breast
and
put
up
her
lips
to
be
kist
as
that
she
did
be
a
child
maiden
yet
when
i
kist
her
she
did
be
a
woman
and
to
kiss
me
very
dear
and
loving
and
to
look
at
me
then
from
under
her
eyelids
and
sudden
to
make
a
dainty
growling
and
to
pretend
that
she
did
be
a
fierce
thing
that
should
be
like
to
eat
me
and
i
to
be
utter
feared
as
you
shall
think
and
to
be
scarce
able
that
i
kiss
mine
own
pretty
fierce
one
because
that
i
did
laugh
so
hearty
and
to
be
so
taken
with
a
surprise
that
the
maid
did
show
this
new
playfulness
and
in
the
same
moment
to
be
stirred
and
waked
anew
that
she
did
be
so
lovely
and
graceful
in
mine
arms
and
to
make
her
naughty
growling
so
pretty
that
i
did
be
eager
that
she
make
it
again
but
she
to
do
this
playing
only
as
her
mood
did
stir
her
and
she
made
then
that
she
would
go
from
me
and
i
to
loose
her
as
ever
and
she
bade
me
that
i
guard
her
the
while
that
she
washt
the
outward
part
of
the
cloak
for
the
inward
did
be
clean
and
the
cloak
proof
to
water
but
the
outward
part
to
be
something
needful
of
washing
and
surely
when
this
was
made
clean
it
dried
very
quick
because
that
the
water
went
not
into
it
and
whilst
that
it
dried
i
gave
mine
own
an
aid
upward
unto
the
cave
and
afterward
i
passed
up
the
gear
and
the
cloak
when
it
did
be
dry
and
so
came
upward
also
myself
and
brought
with
me
a
boulder
that
i
balanced
very
light
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
so
that
it
should
fall
if
that
anything
toucht
it
and
this
plan
you
do
know
of
for
i
used
it
before
as
i
have
told
and
truly
we
did
be
utter
wearied
and
the
time
to
be
something
beyond
three
and
twenty
hours
since
last
we
had
slumber
and
the
maid
had
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
set
to
be
for
my
pillow
and
the
bundle
of
her
torn
garment
to
be
for
her
own
and
she
to
have
me
to
my
pillow
and
to
tuck
the
cloak
about
me
and
the
diskos
to
my
hand
and
afterward
to
kiss
me
very
sedate
upon
the
lips
and
then
to
come
in
under
the
cloak
with
a
quiet
and
lovely
happiness
as
i
did
know
and
to
be
gone
to
slumber
very
content
and
sweet
and
i
waked
eight
good
hours
after
with
the
fizzing
of
the
water
in
mine
ears
and
lo
mine
own
did
be
waked
and
to
make
ready
our
breakfast
and
i
came
upward
upon
mine
elbow
to
see
whether
that
the
boulder
did
be
unmoved
and
indeed
it
was
not
touched
and
mine
own
saw
that
i
was
come
awake
and
she
ran
to
me
very
dear
and
glad
and
kist
my
lips
very
eager
and
loving
and
surely
as
she
kist
me
i
did
feel
that
she
had
taken
again
a
naughty
advantaging
of
my
slumber
and
had
kist
me
as
i
did
sleep
but
truly
i
said
no
word
of
my
thoughts
for
i
did
mind
that
i
should
wake
sudden
one
time
and
so
to
catch
her
in
this
and
to
call
her
then
mine
own
and
that
she
did
be
a
rogue
and
all
as
you
shall
know
that
have
loved
and
i
scolded
the
maid
a
little
in
that
she
had
not
waked
me
but
i
said
not
that
i
would
attend
to
the
duties
that
she
did
heed
to
for
i
knew
that
she
had
joy
of
these
things
in
that
she
did
love
to
do
aught
that
should
be
done
unto
me
and
when
i
scolded
her
she
to
make
but
a
little
mouth
at
me
as
we
do
say
and
to
put
her
tablets
to
my
lips
that
i
kiss
them
and
she
to
kiss
mine
and
so
to
our
breakfast
and
when
we
were
done
we
gat
together
our
gear
and
went
downward
from
the
cave
and
began
again
to
journey
and
we
went
eighteen
hours
that
day
and
eat
and
drunk
at
every
sixth
hour
as
ever
and
in
the
fourteenth
hour
i
perceived
that
i
did
be
like
to
overtravel
the
maid
though
i
made
alway
to
have
a
less
speed
than
did
be
natural
unto
me
and
surely
then
i
took
her
up
into
mine
arms
and
she
to
refuse
and
to
be
troubled
that
i
should
so
carry
her
for
she
did
think
that
i
was
like
to
be
wearied
by
the
task
and
i
to
take
no
heed
to
her
pretestings
but
to
laugh
gently
with
her
and
to
carry
her
even
as
a
babe
in
mine
arms
and
she
to
love
that
she
be
in
mine
arms
if
but
she
be
able
to
have
assuredness
that
i
come
not
to
weariness
through
her
and
truly
it
did
be
a
dear
love
task
and
to
be
set
unto
the
needing
of
mine
especial
heart
and
i
carried
mine
own
then
for
four
hours
and
in
the
eighteenth
hour
we
were
come
to
that
part
of
the
gorge
where
did
be
the
ledge
where
i
killed
the
spider
ere
i
slept
as
you
shall
mayhap
to
mind
and
here
i
aided
the
maid
to
climb
and
we
had
the
same
ledge
that
night
to
be
our
refuge
and
did
sleep
very
happy
and
unharmed
and
alway
with
our
spirits
set
to
warn
us
if
that
harm
did
make
to
come
nigh
to
us
and
we
went
then
through
three
days
of
eighteen
hours
journey
each
and
alway
i
did
carry
mine
own
from
the
twelfth
unto
the
eighteenth
hour
of
each
journeying
and
this
to
be
very
dear
unto
me
and
to
give
me
a
new
rejoicing
that
i
did
be
strong
and
easy
to
carry
mine
own
and
she
to
lie
in
mine
arms
very
content
when
that
she
perceived
how
that
i
did
be
so
glad
to
go
thiswise
and
that
i
had
no
weariness
by
the
carrying
and
thus
i
did
rest
her
feet
and
wore
not
her
dear
and
slender
body
overmuch
with
the
vigour
of
my
going
and
was
abled
to
make
a
very
good
speed
and
mine
own
this
time
and
that
to
make
sayings
of
impudence
unto
me
and
to
hide
her
naughty
lips
when
that
i
should
kiss
them
and
to
have
quaint
nestlings
unto
me
and
odd
whiles
to
kiss
me
very
dainty
when
that
i
did
be
going
thoughtful
of
the
way
and
surely
never
did
there
be
so
dear
a
maid
as
mine
own
so
that
i
did
go
many
a
mile
and
to
be
scarce
that
i
knew
that
i
was
gone
any
way
because
of
the
stirrings
of
my
heart
and
the
content
of
my
spirit
and
oft
as
we
did
go
there
were
great
scorpions
in
the
path
and
odd
whiles
they
to
have
no
heed
to
go
from
my
way
but
to
be
so
great
as
my
head
and
very
fat
and
lazy
so
that
surely
i
kickt
a
good
number
from
my
path
even
as
you
shall
kick
a
ball
with
the
foot
and
three
i
burst
in
this
way
and
truly
it
did
be
well
that
i
had
on
me
mine
armour
else
had
they
been
like
to
sting
me
very
quick
unto
death
for
they
were
so
great
and
likewise
in
this
place
and
that
there
were
snakes
but
none
to
come
anigh
to
me
and
i
to
choose
alway
the
open
goings
for
i
did
think
there
to
be
many
hid
snakes
and
lesser
monsters
in
the
dark
places
between
the
great
boulders
and
alway
when
the
maid
did
walk
i
to
go
before
that
i
see
clear
her
way
and
this
thing
to
be
but
a
matter
of
wiseness
as
you
shall
think
and
odd
whiles
as
i
did
carry
mine
own
she
to
talk
a
little
with
me
of
her
memorydreams
of
the
olden
days
and
mayhap
you
to
think
it
strange
that
we
said
not
overmuch
on
this
wise
but
the
way
of
our
journey
to
have
been
so
utter
bitter
as
you
have
seen
and
we
to
be
more
of
that
far
age
than
we
did
be
of
this
present
age
and
this
present
life
to
seem
but
a
dream
of
memory
and
we
to
be
set
then
with
the
realness
of
that
life
and
this
telling
indeed
to
be
a
plain
thing
to
your
understanding
yet
did
we
have
a
greater
talk
to
these
ends
when
that
we
were
come
free
of
the
gorge
but
yet
oft
there
to
be
an
odd
saying
and
a
sweet
memory
like
to
an
olden
and
forgot
fragrance
of
dreams
to
pass
between
mine
own
and
me
and
do
you
to
set
your
sympathy
of
understanding
with
me
in
this
thing
and
to
know
how
holy
these
things
did
be
and
far
off
and
to
hold
memory
as
a
mist
that
doth
shine
with
golden
lights
that
did
make
an
holy
pain
upon
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
even
as
a
quiet
dawn
of
this
day
doth
set
a
pleasure
of
vague
pain
upon
the
heart
and
once
as
i
did
carry
the
maid
i
saw
that
she
wept
a
little
very
husht
unto
herself
and
i
to
say
naught
for
i
saw
that
it
did
be
a
natural
sorrow
for
her
father
and
for
the
dead
peoples
of
the
lesser
redoubt
that
did
be
left
for
ever
unto
the
desolation
of
eternity
and
so
because
i
did
be
wise
to
leave
her
be
she
to
be
eased
presently
and
to
wipe
her
eyes
quiet
and
secret
and
mayhap
to
think
that
i
did
not
perceive
and
then
to
nestle
unto
me
and
so
to
be
the
more
mine
own
and
about
the
middle
part
of
the
second
day
we
came
past
the
cave
where
i
did
sleep
on
the
upward
journey
and
i
to
tell
naani
and
she
to
look
upward
to
the
cave
and
to
wish
that
she
might
come
a
moment
into
it
only
that
it
did
be
twenty
good
feet
upward
and
i
to
desire
that
she
run
no
risk
of
her
dear
life
when
that
there
did
be
no
need
and
so
to
go
onward
and
odd
whiles
to
see
strange
things
alurk
among
the
boulders
but
none
to
come
anigh
to
us
yet
did
i
keep
the
diskos
very
ready
in
my
hand
as
you
shall
think
and
had
mine
eyes
alway
to
look
upon
every
side
and
mine
ears
to
be
wary
and
to
use
my
spirit
alway
to
mine
aid
and
surely
as
we
did
come
lower
in
the
gorge
the
maid
was
all
awondered
at
the
warmness
that
did
grow
and
something
disturbed
in
the
first
by
the
new
thickness
as
it
did
seem
of
the
air
and
she
to
waste
some
of
the
water
because
that
it
did
fizz
up
so
quick
even
as
i
until
that
she
was
come
used
to
this
newness
and
all
this
to
be
very
plain
unto
you
and
in
the
end
of
every
journey
we
slept
eight
good
hours
in
a
safe
place
and
so
to
go
onward
again
and
the
maid
to
grow
very
eager
as
i
did
tell
her
this
thing
and
that
of
the
country
that
we
did
come
downward
unto
and
she
askt
me
questions
time
and
oft
and
much
i
told
her
and
she
to
think
upon
it
with
a
growing
wonder
and
desire
even
as
a
gladsome
child
that
hath
never
seen
the
sea
and
doth
be
told
that
it
shall
presently
be
there
and
this
to
be
but
to
shadow
the
way
that
naani
did
be
for
truly
she
did
be
a
very
live
and
eager
maid
in
all
things
and
we
to
be
still
within
the
gorge
and
to
go
constant
by
the
fireholes
and
the
firepits
and
to
see
the
flames
leap
upward
in
this
place
and
that
so
that
the
mighty
walls
of
the
gorge
would
show
very
plain
in
an
instant
and
immediately
to
come
the
shadows
again
and
afterward
the
leaping
of
the
flames
and
so
did
it
be
forever
and
oft
the
muttering
of
the
firepits
and
oft
the
utter
quiet
and
the
shadows
and
this
time
and
that
there
did
be
a
snake
to
go
by
us
and
the
scuttling
of
the
monster
scorpions
and
mayhap
a
moving
in
the
shadows
of
the
great
boulders
that
did
tell
me
there
went
maybe
some
peculiar
monster
in
that
place
so
that
i
did
be
very
wary
and
to
have
the
diskos
alway
ready
and
when
the
fourth
day
was
come
i
showed
the
maid
in
the
sixth
hour
the
ledge
that
did
be
my
first
sleeping
place
when
that
i
was
entered
into
the
gorge
now
presently
in
the
eleventh
hour
after
that
we
had
gone
five
hours
in
a
gloom
there
did
show
afar
off
a
shining
and
i
caught
the
maid
and
i
pointed
and
she
also
to
perceive
that
it
did
be
surely
the
shining
of
the
light
of
that
great
country
that
i
did
tell
upon
and
immediately
we
did
begin
to
run
downward
and
with
sore
stumblings
in
this
place
and
that
but
not
to
halt
us
for
we
did
be
so
mad
as
two
children
for
the
gladsome
light
and
we
came
down
presently
in
the
twelfth
hour
of
that
journey
into
the
warm
light
and
wonder
of
the
country
of
the
seas
xiii
homeward
by
the
shore
now
we
came
presently
out
of
that
sad
and
dreary
place
that
did
go
inward
of
the
great
mountains
and
which
i
have
named
the
upward
gorge
and
we
to
halt
soon
between
the
feet
of
the
mountains
beyond
the
mouthpart
of
the
gorge
and
naani
alway
to
look
every
way
about
her
and
to
breathe
very
quick
and
her
eyes
to
be
gone
bright
with
wonder
and
the
seeing
of
new
things
and
the
coming
of
freedom
from
so
great
a
dread
and
she
turned
now
and
did
look
upward
into
the
dark
of
the
gorge
and
to
spy
upon
the
great
mouth
thereof
and
to
be
feared
then
and
must
run
a
greater
way
downward
into
the
lightness
of
the
country
of
the
seas
and
to
come
once
more
to
pause
and
to
look
backward
and
with
an
awe
and
a
relieved
soul
and
so
again
to
the
wonder
of
the
spreaded
country
and
the
great
sea
and
did
near
to
laugh
and
cry
in
the
same
moment
with
the
amazement
and
gladness
and
great
astonishment
that
did
be
upon
her
and
she
to
turn
constant
this
way
and
that
and
to
be
never
ceased
of
looking
and
of
deep
breathings
of
the
wide
air
for
never
in
that
life
had
she
been
in
a
broad
place
of
light
as
you
shall
have
perceived
and
we
to
feel
both
that
there
did
be
no
more
need
to
talk
husht
as
we
did
alway
in
the
gloom
and
narrow
dark
of
the
gorge
and
surely
she
to
shout
as
a
child
that
doth
try
an
echo
and
her
voice
to
go
very
pretty
into
the
distance
and
to
be
lost
afar
off
in
that
country
and
lo
in
a
moment
an
echo
to
come
out
of
the
dark
mountains
to
our
backs
so
that
we
lookt
round
very
sudden
but
whether
the
echo
did
be
truly
an
echo
or
some
strangeness
or
some
unnatural
call
to
come
downward
out
of
the
gloom
and
horror
of
the
gorge
we
did
be
all
unsure
and
indeed
must
run
downward
a
while
more
until
that
we
did
be
all
breathed
and
to
halt
presently
where
we
did
feel
to
be
utter
free
of
the
gorge
and
of
the
strangeness
that
did
seem
to
our
minds
in
that
moment
to
lie
upward
in
the
darkness
of
the
great
mountains
and
surely
we
did
took
about
for
a
flat
rock
to
be
for
our
use
and
we
came
presently
to
a
place
nice
to
our
purpose
that
did
be
yet
upward
over
the
land
and
we
climbed
up
on
to
the
rock
and
sat
thereon
to
have
our
food
and
drink
and
as
we
eat
and
drank
we
did
sit
very
close
and
happy
but
yet
to
have
a
wise
looking
about
anigh
to
us
so
that
we
be
caught
by
no
danger
of
the
humpt
men
or
by
any
other
danger
that
might
be
and
alway
the
maid
did
question
and
did
stare
afar
over
the
country
and
to
have
a
shining
wonder
and
joy
of
the
sea
and
to
be
stirred
in
all
her
being
so
that
she
was
pained
with
vague
and
sudden
memories
that
did
be
as
strange
dreams
and
all
mixt
with
pleasure
and
pain
and
indeed
she
sudden
to
weeping
and
to
need
that
she
be
in
mine
arms
until
that
she
know
herself
once
again
and
so
to
her
dear
natural
joy
and
way
and
oft
did
mine
own
speak
upon
the
clear
wonder
of
the
air
as
it
did
seem
to
her
and
to
me
it
did
seem
likewise
that
had
lived
my
life
also
in
a
dark
land
as
you
do
know
and
she
to
break
sudden
from
her
rapture
and
to
set
back
her
speech
an
eternity
with
vague
words
and
memories
so
olden
and
englamoured
that
they
did
be
as
moonlight
that
once
hath
shone
and
in
a
moment
she
to
be
forward
again
into
that
far
future
time
and
speech
and
all
her
being
to
be
close
unto
me
and
oft
in
a
solemn
silence
of
the
heart
and
the
greatness
of
the
sea
to
call
unto
her
with
an
olden
voice
and
to
half
waken
her
and
i
with
her
to
be
thus
halfwakened
yet
had
i
been
not
thus
as
i
did
come
mine
outward
way
but
truly
i
did
stir
to
the
stirring
of
the
maid
and
all
mine
olden
thoughts
that
did
be
my
memorydreams
to
come
afresh
upon
my
spirit
and
so
we
two
to
sit
there
all
shaken
with
dreamings
that
did
concern
happenings
of
the
olden
world
that
did
lie
upward
in
that
dreadful
night
which
made
a
mighty
and
deeply
roof
over
that
country
and
surely
i
am
dumb
in
that
i
have
no
speech
to
make
known
to
you
all
the
troublings
and
stirrings
of
our
spirits
that
we
did
know
in
that
moment
and
far
off
by
miles
beyond
the
feet
of
the
mountain
where
went
the
shore
of
the
sea
upon
our
left
there
was
a
great
mist
and
steam
and
this
to
be
that
mist
and
steam
that
i
did
come
through
on
mine
outward
way
and
naani
to
ask
concerning
it
and
i
to
tell
her
so
much
as
i
knew
and
how
that
we
must
indeed
come
presently
through
it
upon
our
journey
and
she
to
be
in
wonder
of
the
volcanoes
that
did
burn
in
the
sea
and
in
this
place
and
that
of
the
wide
country
and
the
height
and
grandness
to
exalt
her
and
in
the
same
time
to
give
her
a
strange
humbleness
of
her
mind
so
that
presently
i
did
take
her
into
mine
arms
for
i
must
kiss
her
because
that
she
did
be
so
utter
a
sweet
maiden
and
lovely
with
interest
and
naturalness
and
truly
she
to
kiss
me
in
turn
and
to
make
her
questionings
between
her
kissings
and
this
to
be
because
she
did
yearn
for
a
greater
knowing
of
the
country
but
also
as
i
do
half
to
think
because
she
did
be
sweetly
impudent
unto
me
and
this
to
be
of
her
joy
and
presently
she
to
kiss
me
thrice
very
passionate
and
warm
upon
the
mouth
and
immediately
to
take
my
shoulders
with
her
small
hands
that
did
seem
so
pretty
upon
my
broadness
and
upon
the
metal
of
the
armour
and
she
to
strive
thus
that
she
shake
me
to
a
speedier
answering
and
she
all
that
while
to
be
full
of
a
dear
naughtiness
and
to
need
that
she
be
kist
very
hard
and
i
to
answer
her
but
after
mine
own
fashion
which
did
be
a
word
between
each
kiss
that
i
gave
to
her
and
she
very
quick
and
naughty
to
put
her
hand
between
our
lips
and
i
then
to
kiss
the
palm
that
did
be
in
my
way
and
did
be
very
small
and
pretty
and
she
when
i
had
no
thought
to
open
her
fingers
very
quick
and
kiss
me
through
between
the
fingers
and
immediately
to
shut
the
fingers
so
that
i
did
be
stopt
from
the
same
and
afterward
i
made
her
to
stand
upon
the
rock
and
i
set
free
her
hair
over
her
shoulders
and
i
took
then
the
boots
from
her
so
that
her
little
feet
did
show
bare
and
pretty
and
she
at
the
first
half
to
refuse
me
but
afterward
to
stand
very
dear
and
obedient
that
i
should
have
my
way
with
her
and
to
be
a
little
shy
and
the
more
pretty
because
of
her
sweet
blushings
and
surely
when
that
i
had
her
to
my
likings
i
stept
back
a
little
pace
and
lookt
at
her
and
she
to
look
again
at
me
very
quaint
and
naughty
and
then
to
turn
her
about
very
grave
and
to
make
pretend
that
she
did
be
a
dummy
figure
and
surely
when
she
did
be
come
right
round
and
to
face
me
again
and
had
a
very
sedate
look
she
stretched
out
her
pretty
foot
all
in
a
moment
and
put
her
pink
toes
sudden
upon
my
lips
and
i
to
be
so
in
surprise
that
i
had
not
wit
to
do
aught
ere
she
had
them
back
swift
from
me
and
she
then
to
make
one
glad
spring
into
mine
arms
and
to
want
that
she
be
hugged
and
to
be
loved
very
great
and
i
to
laugh
all
tender
for
i
loved
her
so
utter
as
you
do
know
and
i
to
tell
her
as
you
sure
likewise
to
have
told
your
maid
that
i
wanted
a
pocket
sufficient
that
i
might
have
her
therein
alway
anigh
to
my
heart
and
this
thing
i
to
say
to
her
as
a
man
that
doth
love
shall
say
it
and
you
to
know
the
way
of
it
so
well
as
i
and
she
to
laugh
very
mischievous
and
to
tell
me
that
she
should
truly
tickle
me
if
that
i
carried
her
thatwise
aye
and
to
pinch
me
too
and
i
to
have
no
answer
save
that
i
shake
her
very
gentle
but
indeed
she
to
kiss
me
very
naughty
on
the
mouth
in
the
midst
of
my
shaking
and
truly
what
shall
a
man
do
with
such
an
one
and
she
then
to
want
to
be
more
sedate
and
to
be
set
down
upon
the
rock
and
she
to
make
me
to
turn
around
so
that
she
should
come
at
the
pouch
which
did
be
upon
my
back
and
she
gat
thence
the
comb
that
was
a
fitment
and
did
comb
her
pretty
hair
and
i
to
sit
and
talk
with
her
and
to
jest
with
a
heart
that
did
be
so
light
as
it
had
not
been
for
a
great
while
for
though
i
did
dread
the
humpt
men
and
the
monstrous
animals
of
the
country
of
seas
i
had
not
any
abiding
horror
of
aught
that
i
had
seen
in
that
country
for
there
seemed
a
naturalness
in
all
things
so
that
i
did
have
no
loathing
neither
any
fear
of
an
evil
force
and
presently
when
that
the
maid
had
combed
her
hair
she
to
bind
it
upon
her
head
but
i
to
ask
that
she
leave
it
upon
her
shoulders
because
that
it
did
be
so
pretty
and
she
to
smile
at
me
and
to
be
happy
to
my
pleasuring
now
we
did
be
truly
sedate
and
to
set
our
gear
together
and
i
to
put
the
boots
upon
the
maid
and
afterward
we
to
begin
again
to
journey
downward
into
the
country
of
the
seas
and
we
went
at
a
good
pace
but
not
to
bring
us
to
any
great
weariness
for
it
was
mine
intent
that
we
rest
for
our
slumber
upon
this
side
of
the
place
where
did
be
the
steam
of
the
boilings
that
was
anigh
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
as
you
shall
mind
and
we
at
this
time
to
be
passing
along
the
feet
of
the
mountains
unto
the
place
of
the
steam
and
to
go
thiswise
for
six
good
hours
and
still
to
be
a
great
hour
off
that
part
for
we
went
not
so
fierce
as
did
be
the
speed
of
mine
outward
way
which
was
utter
strong
as
you
do
mind
that
have
gone
with
me
in
all
my
journey
and
so
when
we
had
walkt
six
hours
we
did
be
gone
something
beyond
the
eighteenth
hour
of
that
days
journeying
and
to
be
very
ready
to
our
slumber
now
presently
we
found
a
tall
rock
very
hard
to
climb
that
had
a
flat
top
so
great
as
may
be
twice
my
length
everyways
and
this
to
be
very
good
to
our
purpose
and
when
we
were
come
safe
to
the
top
we
to
eat
and
drink
and
presently
to
sleep
and
to
have
the
cloak
under
us
as
did
be
the
will
of
the
maid
for
the
country
did
be
utter
warm
and
nice
so
that
we
had
no
occasion
for
covering
and
surely
we
waked
both
of
us
when
that
we
had
slept
seven
good
hours
and
we
sat
upward
and
lookt
newly
each
at
the
other
and
to
be
as
that
we
did
each
see
the
other
anew
in
that
good
light
and
to
have
a
fresh
joy
each
in
the
look
of
the
other
and
she
to
come
into
mine
arms
and
to
kiss
and
to
need
that
she
be
kist
and
truly
we
both
to
have
our
need
but
yet
to
be
something
the
more
hungry
of
the
other
for
the
having
and
mine
own
then
to
make
our
breakfast
and
the
water
to
fizz
very
strong
and
surprising
and
we
to
eat
and
drink
and
to
be
utter
happy
each
with
the
other
and
to
talk
on
this
thing
and
that
and
the
maid
to
look
about
as
we
eat
and
she
to
look
afar
off
at
the
wonders
and
the
newness
of
the
country
to
her
knowledge
but
i
to
look
near
lest
there
be
any
danger
that
might
be
anigh
and
in
a
while
mine
own
to
draw
my
gaze
to
the
mountains
that
the
gorge
came
through
and
in
verity
now
that
i
did
look
in
ease
i
to
see
with
her
how
that
they
did
be
truly
monstrous
even
as
a
monstrous
wall
that
did
go
upward
for
ever
until
that
they
were
gone
out
of
the
light
of
that
country
into
the
dark
night
of
the
deathly
upper
world
that
did
be
lost
an
eternity
and
i
to
mind
that
i
had
some
vague
thoughts
thiswise
on
the
outward
way
but
now
i
to
have
ease
and
the
maid
to
speak
with
and
so
to
perceive
odd
matters
the
more
and
i
to
tell
you
this
little
thing
so
that
you
shall
perceive
the
way
that
restfulness
did
be
upon
me
by
compare
with
the
outward
going
and
truly
we
had
no
great
speed
with
our
talk
and
with
our
eating
but
in
the
end
did
make
somewhat
to
hurry
because
that
we
did
be
conscious
that
we
leaned
to
slackness
and
indeed
we
came
down
then
pretty
speedy
from
the
rock
where
we
did
sleep
and
had
forward
to
our
way
at
a
good
pace
and
when
we
had
gone
a
while
we
to
begin
to
hear
the
far
hissing
of
the
steam
and
the
noise
of
the
upward
burstings
of
waters
that
did
boil
and
the
sound
to
be
very
strange
but
i
to
have
heard
it
before
as
you
do
know
so
that
it
to
trouble
me
the
less
than
the
maid
and
i
to
assure
her
and
she
to
come
nigh
to
me
and
thiswise
we
to
enter
presently
into
the
steam
and
we
went
then
for
more
than
three
hours
and
i
had
the
maid
to
my
back
that
i
should
be
the
first
and
this
i
did
that
she
have
no
danger
to
walk
into
a
boiling
pool
in
the
mazingness
of
the
steam
which
was
everywhere
and
i
to
be
something
guided
in
my
path
by
the
shore
of
the
sea
which
did
be
unto
our
left
alway
only
that
we
could
see
neither
the
sea
nor
otherwise
except
that
we
go
so
close
that
we
near
into
the
water
and
truly
the
sea
to
seem
to
boil
in
parts
and
there
to
be
hot
pools
in
all
places
so
that
who
should
say
with
ease
whether
we
did
go
by
one
of
the
great
hot
pools
or
by
the
true
sea
and
this
our
constant
puzzle
shall
be
likewise
to
you
and
you
to
perceive
how
that
we
did
go
utter
wary
and
about
us
from
every
part
there
did
come
the
strange
burstings
and
shriekings
and
whistlings
of
the
boil
of
the
waters
breaking
upward
from
the
deep
world
and
odd
whiles
the
sounds
to
be
as
of
great
monsters
and
the
earth
to
shake
under
us
and
otherwhiles
there
to
be
a
hush
and
only
the
steam
about
us
and
somewhere
in
the
distance
and
uncertainness
a
low
piping
of
some
steam
cranny
very
strange
and
lonesomesounding
and
when
it
did
be
somewheres
nigh
upon
the
fourth
hour
we
came
out
of
the
thick
steam
and
the
pipings
and
the
roarings
to
be
to
our
rearward
and
soon
the
steam
to
be
gone
thin
as
but
a
mist
and
the
noises
to
be
very
farseeming
and
presently
we
to
be
come
clear
out
into
the
air
of
that
country
and
the
maid
now
to
perceive
the
trees
which
did
be
in
great
forests
unto
our
right
hand
while
that
the
shore
of
the
sea
did
go
alway
upon
our
left
and
she
to
be
utter
in
wonder
of
the
trees
and
to
need
that
she
pluck
branches
and
smell
of
them
and
look
at
each
leaf
and
so
to
be
all
stirred
for
never
in
that
life
did
she
to
have
seen
such
a
matter
as
those
great
trees
did
be
but
yet
to
be
all
stirred
by
vague
memories
that
did
seem
no
more
than
dreams
and
you
to
think
but
a
moment
and
to
perceive
how
the
thing
did
be
with
her
and
you
to
have
been
likewise
stirred
if
that
you
did
be
so
strangely
waked
in
a
corner
part
of
the
heart
though
but
a
little
matter
to
wake
you
now
when
the
sixth
hour
did
be
full
come
we
made
a
halt
in
a
wise
place
and
had
there
our
tablets
and
the
water
and
afterward
the
maid
bid
me
that
i
take
her
unto
a
warm
pool
that
did
be
near
by
and
to
ask
that
i
turn
from
her
but
yet
to
be
anigh
for
her
protector
as
i
did
be
ever
and
so
she
to
wash
and
to
make
herself
happy
with
a
sweet
cleanness
that
did
be
proper
to
her
and
afterward
when
she
did
be
done
she
to
act
watch
whilst
i
to
mine
and
to
help
me
in
all
matters
that
she
was
able
and
truly
i
to
be
happy
indeed
that
she
did
so
have
delight
to
attend
upon
me
and
to
treat
me
motherwise
yet
truly
with
her
maidheart
not
all
hid
as
you
have
perceived
this
time
and
that
and
surely
thus
did
we
go
alway
in
these
matters
and
oft
that
i
have
not
space
to
have
told
and
oft
that
you
shall
remember
if
that
i
do
be
too
full
of
other
happenings
to
give
heed
to
tell
upon
and
afterward
we
to
our
journeying
again
and
to
talk
upon
this
thing
and
that
thing
and
i
to
be
watchful
as
we
talked
and
to
tell
the
maid
that
she
keep
her
eyes
wary
but
yet
not
to
be
of
unease
and
when
we
did
go
thiswise
for
seven
good
hours
we
were
come
nigh
opposed
to
the
brightburning
firehill
that
did
be
offward
in
the
sea
and
had
made
me
a
warm
light
in
that
time
when
i
did
sleep
in
the
tree
as
you
do
remember
and
truly
as
i
shall
here
mind
you
we
did
be
past
seven
hours
coming
to
this
place
from
the
part
where
the
steam
did
be
yet
had
i
gone
that
space
upon
the
outward
way
at
a
speed
that
was
greater
but
truly
i
might
not
set
so
great
a
pace
to
the
maid
save
mayhap
odd
whiles
and
this
thing
i
beg
that
you
have
alway
in
your
mind
and
so
to
understand
why
that
we
did
be
oft
long
upon
this
part
of
the
journey
and
that
by
compare
with
mine
outward
going
and
in
verity
i
had
set
off
our
hour
for
food
because
that
i
saw
we
did
come
nigh
to
the
place
where
the
tree
did
be
and
i
to
know
that
the
maid
should
like
to
eat
and
drink
anigh
to
that
place
and
to
know
that
i
did
sleep
there
and
surely
i
took
her
to
the
tree
and
when
that
i
told
her
she
to
beg
me
that
i
indulge
her
and
that
we
go
upward
to
that
branch
where
i
did
sleep
and
there
to
eat
our
tablets
and
i
to
be
willing
and
to
enter
into
her
wishing
for
indeed
there
was
no
danger
in
the
climb
and
i
to
go
alway
below
her
so
that
i
could
be
surety
for
her
safeness
and
we
came
up
to
the
great
branch
and
she
to
make
how
we
should
sit
and
i
to
have
to
show
just
where
i
did
lie
and
she
to
look
very
close
and
to
see
that
my
weight
had
surely
marked
the
hardness
of
the
armour
upon
the
bark
and
she
then
to
be
upon
that
branch
alone
as
she
did
eat
and
drink
and
to
look
outward
at
the
light
from
the
firehill
and
to
be
very
husht
and
to
think
and
i
not
to
disturb
her
with
speech
and
when
she
did
be
done
she
gat
from
the
branch
and
kist
the
place
where
i
did
lie
and
lo
in
a
moment
a
thought
came
into
her
and
she
drew
her
knife
and
cut
out
a
piece
of
the
bark
and
put
it
into
her
breast
to
be
for
a
keepsake
and
so
to
seem
somewise
contented
and
truly
i
told
her
about
the
great
beast
when
we
were
come
down
again
to
the
earth
and
she
to
cry
out
and
to
show
me
that
there
did
be
yet
the
mark
where
the
belly
of
the
monstrous
beast
did
brush
upon
the
earth
as
it
ran
and
moreover
the
broken
places
of
the
footmarks
and
she
by
this
to
see
how
great
a
beast
it
did
be
but
yet
did
it
be
a
little
thing
beside
the
slug
only
that
it
did
be
a
thing
of
horn
and
hardness
of
skin
as
you
have
perceived
and
truly
i
do
mind
how
that
the
observings
of
the
maid
did
bring
very
keen
to
me
how
that
there
had
past
but
seventeen
days
since
that
i
did
go
onward
from
this
place
and
this
to
seem
very
strange
and
scarce
credible
unto
me
for
i
had
thought
it
somewise
as
a
great
time
and
truly
this
to
be
because
it
was
so
marked
by
stress
of
the
mind
and
great
happenings
and
you
to
agree
in
this
thing
but
yet
also
we
shall
truly
mind
that
those
times
that
i
have
called
days
did
hold
oft
the
hours
of
two
days
and
mayhap
three
as
you
do
remember
now
we
went
onward
then
to
our
journeying
and
i
to
make
to
carry
the
maid
as
ever
after
that
she
had
walked
twelve
hours
though
she
did
walk
thirteen
hours
this
time
as
you
have
seen
and
she
to
say
that
she
go
now
upon
her
own
feet
through
the
next
six
hours
and
so
to
ease
me
from
the
labour
that
did
be
needful
to
carry
her
but
i
to
know
how
that
she
did
be
like
to
be
all
gone
of
her
strength
thiswise
in
but
a
day
or
two
and
we
to
make
the
better
speed
if
that
i
keep
to
my
way
and
to
have
her
to
walk
twelve
hours
of
every
journey
and
afterward
to
come
into
mine
arms
for
truly
she
did
be
bred
less
hardy
than
i
as
you
shall
think
from
all
that
i
have
told
concerning
the
peoples
of
the
lesser
pyramid
and
moreover
she
was
yet
something
weakened
as
i
did
think
by
the
dreadful
month
of
her
lonesomeness
and
escapings
before
that
i
was
come
to
succour
her
and
truly
as
i
did
carry
her
the
maid
did
make
remark
of
her
wonderment
concerning
me
in
that
i
did
be
so
hard
of
my
body
and
set
in
the
determination
of
my
mind
and
in
verity
i
did
be
exceeding
strong
and
of
great
hardness
of
body
and
mayhap
my
will
did
be
somewhat
this
way
also
else
do
i
think
i
had
never
borne
to
come
unto
mine
own
through
so
much
desolation
and
i
to
smile
very
happy
upon
her
for
i
did
love
that
i
was
so
strong
and
very
truly
in
delight
that
mine
own
maid
did
take
gladness
in
this
thing
and
you
to
mind
how
you
did
be
also
in
the
lovedays
and
so
to
have
nice
understanding
of
my
naturalness
and
human
pride
and
surely
the
maid
did
nestle
unto
me
as
she
did
talk
even
somewise
as
a
child
shall
come
nigh
to
the
mother
but
yet
also
as
a
maid
doth
love
to
be
nigh
unto
her
man
if
that
she
doth
truly
love
and
i
to
lift
her
more
nigh
to
my
lips
but
she
to
refuse
to
kiss
me
and
to
be
a
sweet
impertinence
that
did
lie
in
mine
arms
yet
when
i
did
make
to
lower
her
again
to
the
way
that
had
her
easy
to
carry
she
to
slip
her
pretty
face
very
snug
under
my
chin
and
to
kiss
me
there
after
her
own
fashion
and
afterward
to
be
willing
that
she
be
as
usual
into
mine
arms
now
as
i
set
the
maid
again
comfortable
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
something
tender
and
sudden
it
came
to
me
that
mayhap
the
armour
to
be
very
hard
and
painful
unto
her
and
i
to
ask
this
thing
of
her
in
a
moment
and
she
to
see
that
i
would
not
be
put
off
and
so
to
tell
me
and
truly
i
was
utter
angered
with
myself
and
somewise
also
with
her
in
that
she
did
not
waken
mine
unthinkingness
to
this
thing
and
i
set
her
instant
to
the
earth
and
made
her
to
bare
her
shoulders
to
me
and
truly
they
did
be
much
bruised
where
that
she
had
lain
so
oft
in
mine
arms
against
the
hardness
of
mine
armour
and
i
to
be
so
angered
that
i
near
shook
her
and
she
to
see
how
i
did
be
and
that
she
did
be
nigh
to
be
shaken
because
that
i
was
grown
so
angry
that
she
should
let
herself
come
to
this
foolish
hurt
that
yet
i
did
know
was
very
dear
unto
her
secret
heart
and
in
truth
she
put
up
her
lips
to
me
very
sudden
and
with
a
strange
naughtiness
that
she
have
her
own
way
with
me
to
tempt
me
from
mine
anger
that
yet
she
did
half
to
like
and
in
verity
i
near
slapt
her
then
upon
her
pretty
shoulders
but
that
she
ceased
from
her
tempting
of
me
and
instead
she
turned
her
shoulders
to
me
even
as
a
child
that
i
button
her
garment
for
her
and
surely
when
i
had
buttoned
her
garment
she
came
round
unto
me
and
closed
her
hand
so
that
it
did
be
a
little
fist
even
as
i
did
love
her
to
do
because
that
it
was
so
small
beside
my
great
hand
and
she
slipt
her
shut
hand
into
mine
and
surely
i
let
it
stay
within
very
quiet
and
made
not
to
close
upon
it
as
i
did
wont
and
the
maid
did
move
her
hand
around
in
mine
that
she
make
me
to
take
notice
upon
her
and
to
grasp
her
little
fist
yet
i
did
be
very
stern
for
i
was
truly
angered
and
neither
did
i
put
her
hand
from
mine
nor
made
to
hold
it
but
only
to
let
it
bide
yet
truly
i
to
be
something
stirred
in
the
heartpart
by
her
pretty
ways
and
in
a
little
while
she
took
her
hand
from
out
of
mine
and
did
have
daring
to
be
cold
unto
me
and
mine
anger
then
to
be
quaintly
renewed
and
to
think
that
she
did
well
need
to
be
whipt
and
she
made
a
naughty
and
foolish
impudence
upon
that
which
i
said
to
her
so
that
presently
i
did
say
that
she
did
need
such
as
should
make
her
to
heed
her
manners
but
yet
as
you
shall
conceive
i
to
know
inwardly
all
that
time
how
that
even
this
true
naughtiness
did
not
stir
me
to
proper
anger
but
more
that
it
made
me
masterful
and
to
lack
not
that
i
make
her
to
know
truly
that
i
did
be
her
master
and
in
the
same
time
to
be
strangely
touched
in
a
very
deep
and
secret
place
of
my
heart
and
truly
love
doth
have
strange
actings
upon
the
heart
and
the
maid
to
ask
me
in
a
very
saucy
fashion
that
did
be
intentioned
to
anger
me
what
i
did
mean
that
she
to
need
and
truly
i
said
that
she
did
go
the
way
to
earn
that
she
be
flogged
like
any
boy
and
i
to
mean
actual
all
that
i
did
say
which
doth
something
amaze
me
now
but
as
i
do
know
i
yet
to
be
constant
stirred
inwardly
by
her
beloved
quaintness
that
did
be
alway
so
dainty
even
when
that
she
did
mean
her
naughtiness
to
be
truly
to
anger
me
and
lo
when
i
told
the
maid
this
thing
that
she
did
well
go
to
earn
a
sharp
reproof
she
turned
in
a
quick
instant
and
came
close
to
me
all
tender
and
small
and
to
need
to
be
nigh
to
me
and
she
slipt
both
her
closed
hands
into
the
one
of
mine
and
truly
they
did
be
little
fists
and
because
i
could
be
no
more
stern
with
mine
own
i
put
mine
arm
about
her
and
she
did
nestle
to
me
so
that
all
my
being
did
want
to
be
a
shield
about
her
and
she
to
hark
very
quiet
and
humble
to
my
counsellings
and
in
the
end
did
be
so
strangely
husht
that
i
lookt
down
to
where
her
pretty
face
did
be
hid
against
mine
armour
as
she
did
love
to
do
when
that
i
did
be
those
odd
whiles
a
little
stern
with
her
and
i
held
her
face
away
from
mine
armour
and
surely
she
did
be
smiling
very
quiet
and
naughty
so
that
i
perceived
that
she
did
be
good
only
for
that
time
and
did
be
like
to
show
again
this
wrongful
and
impudent
spirit
yet
i
not
then
to
be
in
trouble
of
the
future
but
to
hope
only
that
i
do
wisely
if
that
she
show
again
this
waywardness
and
truly
i
to
perceive
now
that
i
did
be
very
young
but
anywise
as
you
do
know
i
to
act
alway
from
the
natural
telling
of
my
heart
and
i
shook
naani
a
little
for
this
naughty
spirit
which
did
not
be
gone
from
her
for
i
perceived
that
my
manhood
had
but
stirred
the
woman
in
her
to
that
strange
quick
humbleness
that
had
seemed
to
be
a
quenching
of
her
wayward
unwisdom
and
truly
it
had
not
been
stilled
but
only
sunken
for
a
little
moment
in
the
uprising
of
her
dear
nature
which
had
responded
unto
me
and
the
maid
to
look
at
me
from
under
her
lids
as
i
did
shake
her
with
gentleness
and
i
to
know
that
mine
own
did
be
a
wondrous
maiden
full
of
all
life
and
spirit
and
to
be
held
wisely
and
to
be
loosed
wisely
all
as
did
be
for
the
best
to
bring
out
the
uttermost
of
her
goodness
which
did
be
in
all
her
being
and
to
be
very
lovely
and
to
make
me
feel
as
that
i
did
be
a
giant
that
held
a
white
flower
very
tender
but
i
to
feel
also
that
i
did
be
her
master
and
this
mayhap
you
to
understand
if
that
you
look
into
your
hearts
and
by
all
my
telling
you
to
know
that
i
did
be
very
dainty
with
mine
own
maid
that
did
be
all
of
daintiness
but
yet
i
to
be
masterful
as
did
be
my
nature
and
a
very
proper
way
it
did
be
with
the
maid
so
that
she
did
be
alway
reasonable
in
the
main
and
this
to
come
out
of
her
love
which
did
have
pleasure
to
know
that
i
did
be
master
unto
her
all
in
the
same
while
that
she
did
fight
to
show
that
i
did
be
otherwise
and
truly
and
in
part
by
this
same
showing
you
shall
perceive
that
her
naughtiness
to
come
likewise
from
her
love
and
the
way
that
my
nature
did
work
upon
her
now
i
to
shake
the
maid
very
gentle
as
i
have
said
and
with
much
that
did
be
of
play
but
in
the
same
wise
there
to
be
also
somewhat
of
tender
reproof
and
surely
that
naughty
maid
to
spring
very
light
upon
her
toes
and
had
kist
me
sudden
and
dainty
upon
the
mouth
before
that
i
did
wot
and
i
to
put
mine
arm
about
her
and
to
give
her
a
little
hug
and
immediately
then
to
matters
that
did
be
practical
for
i
was
eager
to
have
come
across
that
stony
part
of
the
journey
that
did
be
before
us
as
you
do
know
before
that
we
look
for
a
place
for
our
slumber
and
this
eagerness
of
haste
to
be
because
of
the
great
bird
things
which
i
had
seen
to
go
bounding
over
that
waste
when
that
i
was
upon
mine
outward
way
and
surely
after
that
i
had
thought
a
little
moment
i
bid
the
maid
that
she
dress
in
her
torn
garments
so
that
these
should
be
over
the
top
of
the
armoursuit
and
thiswise
to
make
a
soft
thickness
upon
the
top
of
the
armoursuit
that
should
act
for
a
cushion
between
mine
armour
and
her
dear
body
but
indeed
the
maid
would
nowise
to
do
this
thing
and
i
not
to
make
her
because
that
my
heart
perceived
how
it
did
be
with
her
and
her
reasons
to
be
someways
mixt
as
doth
be
proper
in
all
humans
and
the
more
so
when
that
it
doth
be
a
maid
that
hath
reasons
as
you
to
know
if
that
you
have
ever
held
such
dear
perverseness
in
your
arms
and
she
as
i
could
know
to
be
strangely
in
love
that
her
gentle
body
be
bruised
by
the
hardness
of
mine
armour
and
if
this
might
not
be
she
to
be
not
wishful
that
she
wear
her
torn
clothing
upon
her
neat
suit
and
so
to
seem
careless
and
to
lack
to
be
dainty
in
mine
eyes
for
indeed
she
did
be
alway
to
wash
herself
and
to
make
tidiness
and
she
to
have
a
way
now
that
she
did
set
the
armoursuit
upon
her
that
had
it
to
seem
different
and
she
to
have
set
a
little
sprig
from
the
trees
upon
her
breast
and
in
her
girdle
and
so
to
seem
the
more
of
a
maid
and
surely
a
man
doth
know
and
love
these
things
but
not
alway
to
have
full
knowing
how
that
they
be
done
and
indeed
you
to
be
likewise
with
me
in
this
thing
and
we
all
to
think
we
know
but
somewise
to
be
just
alack
when
that
it
doth
come
to
the
proof
and
in
verity
the
maid
to
find
a
way
that
she
be
eased
of
the
hardness
of
the
armour
and
i
to
have
come
to
the
same
thing
in
the
same
moment
but
truly
i
do
think
she
had
been
able
to
think
upon
it
a
long
while
if
that
she
had
been
so
desired
and
truly
this
was
but
that
i
fold
the
cloak
very
thick
across
mine
arms
and
breast
and
to
take
her
then
into
the
little
nest
that
did
be
prepared
and
surely
now
that
the
maid
might
no
more
have
her
secret
wish
that
she
lie
close
against
mine
armour
she
to
be
helpful
and
to
have
the
cloak
folded
so
in
a
very
quick
while
and
so
to
be
into
mine
arms
again
and
we
to
be
once
more
upon
the
journey
and
she
to
nestle
to
me
as
that
she
did
hunger
to
be
nigh
to
me
and
she
to
talk
with
me
odd
whiles
and
odd
whiles
to
be
silent
and
once
i
to
think
that
she
wept
a
little
and
to
know
that
she
did
be
like
to
think
upon
her
father
and
her
own
peoples
but
she
to
have
her
face
turned
to
me
so
that
i
could
but
guess
upon
this
thing
and
she
very
soon
to
be
husht
again
of
this
sorrow
and
to
lie
content
in
mine
arms
and
once
when
that
i
had
carried
her
for
three
hours
she
to
ask
me
that
i
kiss
her
and
truly
i
did
kiss
her
very
gentle
and
with
reverence
because
that
my
heart
did
understand
the
holiness
that
did
be
in
her
heart
in
that
moment
and
surely
as
i
kist
her
she
to
kiss
me
very
tender
and
i
to
know
that
some
olden
memory
did
be
like
to
stir
in
her
and
in
a
moment
she
to
take
her
lips
from
mine
where
she
had
let
them
to
nestle
very
light
and
did
whisper
mine
olden
lovename
and
i
then
to
look
at
her
and
her
eyes
to
shine
as
the
olden
stars
that
did
shine
in
the
olden
summers
and
i
to
be
too
shaken
even
that
i
kiss
her
but
she
to
put
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
to
look
steadfast
into
mine
eyes
and
immediately
after
that
she
had
lookt
awhile
and
i
to
have
ceased
from
walking
she
to
put
her
hands
upon
each
side
of
my
face
within
the
metal
of
mine
headgear
where
the
guards
did
come
down
at
the
sides
and
she
to
kiss
me
very
sober
upon
the
lips
but
yet
to
mean
utter
by
that
kiss
and
i
not
to
return
the
kiss
for
i
saw
that
it
did
not
be
her
need
now
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
hour
as
i
did
go
with
the
maid
i
to
see
afar
off
one
of
the
halfbird
monsters
that
i
did
see
before
upon
this
place
where
there
did
be
naught
save
great
stones
and
boulders
for
a
great
way
that
did
be
many
miles
and
truly
i
to
hide
very
swift
with
the
maid
where
two
great
boulders
did
come
together
and
surely
the
birdcreature
to
go
past
at
no
great
way
and
to
go
with
a
great
bounding
that
did
be
half
of
flight
and
half
of
leaping
as
that
it
did
be
too
weighty
in
the
body
to
make
to
fly
proper
and
indeed
i
to
have
a
sudden
memory
how
that
there
did
be
a
picture
in
some
book
that
i
did
read
in
the
mighty
pyramid
where
it
did
show
such
a
birdthing
as
this
and
to
make
remark
in
the
book
that
these
things
had
been
seen
no
more
in
the
night
land
for
a
score
thousand
of
years
or
more
and
to
be
extinct
as
we
do
say
but
indeed
now
i
do
think
that
they
did
be
come
downward
to
that
warm
country
a
great
while
gone
and
so
to
have
new
life
and
to
breed
through
a
great
age
and
this
way
to
have
set
a
pattern
unto
the
humans
and
in
verity
it
might
be
that
in
some
age
that
did
be
far
after
that
time
the
humans
to
find
some
way
to
journey
from
the
pyramid
and
to
build
a
new
refuge
in
that
deep
country
and
mayhap
the
humans
thiswise
to
have
a
new
space
of
life
after
that
all
the
night
land
did
be
dead
and
lost
in
the
bitter
frost
of
eternity
but
this
indeed
to
be
no
more
than
an
odd
thought
for
how
might
any
great
multitude
pass
the
monsters
and
i
to
ask
that
you
take
it
for
nothing
of
fact
but
only
as
of
my
suppositions
and
thiswise
to
come
back
again
to
happenings
now
when
the
birdthing
did
be
gone
a
long
way
off
i
to
go
forward
again
with
mine
own
and
to
have
a
new
care
and
to
look
very
swift
and
frequent
everyway
and
truly
it
did
be
as
that
the
creatures
did
inhabit
that
part
of
the
country
for
in
an
hour
after
that
i
to
see
a
good
score
and
i
to
free
the
diskos
from
my
hip
and
to
have
it
ready
in
mine
arms
beside
the
maid
and
so
to
journey
and
many
times
i
to
have
to
hide
with
mine
own
and
to
crouch
low
among
the
rocks
and
the
boulders
and
this
way
to
escape
free
of
all
for
a
great
while
yet
when
that
the
fifth
hour
did
be
nigh
gone
i
heard
a
noise
sudden
to
my
back
as
we
did
go
over
a
clear
space
and
in
verity
there
did
be
one
of
the
monsters
that
came
upward
over
certain
rocks
that
were
to
my
rearward
and
surely
it
to
have
been
stayed
hid
there
or
resting
and
to
have
heard
us
or
to
have
smelled
us
but
anywise
then
to
have
knowledge
of
us
and
to
come
with
low
and
brutish
heavy
boundings
very
lumbersome
after
us
and
i
lookt
everyway
in
a
moment
but
there
was
nowhere
any
shelter
anigh
and
the
maid
to
leap
sudden
from
mine
arms
that
i
be
free
with
the
diskos
and
i
to
look
swift
to
her
and
to
see
that
she
have
her
knife
ready
in
her
hand
that
she
might
chance
to
aid
me
but
surely
i
might
not
fight
in
ease
of
mind
if
that
mine
own
did
be
needless
in
danger
and
i
caught
her
very
quick
by
the
waist
and
set
her
upon
the
ground
between
my
feet
and
she
to
make
half
to
refuse
but
i
to
have
no
time
for
explaining
and
to
be
sharp
that
i
have
her
safe
so
that
i
gave
her
a
little
shake
that
did
sudden
to
make
her
feel
the
strength
in
me
and
she
then
to
be
instant
quiet
in
my
hands
and
to
let
me
that
i
set
her
upon
her
face
and
to
cast
the
thick
cloak
above
her
and
in
a
moment
to
be
stood
over
her
and
to
set
down
the
visor
of
mine
headgear
lest
that
the
birdmonster
strike
me
in
the
face
and
surely
the
birdthing
did
be
scarce
an
hundred
good
paces
off
and
to
make
two
lumbering
and
monstrous
bounds
and
to
come
at
me
yet
truly
it
made
sudden
a
pause
because
that
the
diskos
did
roar
and
send
out
fire
as
i
made
it
to
spin
but
in
an
instant
the
great
thing
to
come
in
at
me
upon
the
left
side
and
to
strike
me
very
hard
with
the
bill
that
did
be
so
long
as
mine
arm
and
had
surely
gone
through
my
body
if
that
i
had
been
naked
and
the
bill
of
the
monster
rang
upon
mine
armour
and
it
smote
me
twice
thiswise
so
that
i
staggered
very
sick
and
shaken
but
in
a
moment
as
it
made
to
draw
off
that
it
should
come
the
more
hard
upon
me
i
swung
the
diskos
very
sure
and
quick
and
i
smote
the
birdthing
above
the
place
where
the
great
seemingleathern
wing
did
join
upon
the
right
side
as
it
should
be
the
shoulder
of
the
birdmonster
and
in
verity
the
monster
gave
out
a
mighty
squarking
and
went
backward
this
way
and
that
and
beat
all
about
upon
the
stones
and
did
strike
with
the
great
bill
at
the
place
where
it
did
be
hurt
and
i
heeded
that
i
end
it
swiftly
and
i
ran
in
upon
it
and
the
creature
to
strike
at
me
with
the
great
bill
very
savage
but
i
jumpt
speedy
to
this
side
and
again
to
that
and
so
in
a
moment
to
have
chance
to
come
in
surely
and
truly
i
split
the
skull
of
the
birdthing
so
that
it
died
very
quick
and
was
gone
from
pain
and
the
birdcreature
lay
all
spread
upon
the
stones
and
the
rock
of
that
place
and
surely
it
did
be
as
that
it
were
leathern
and
made
somewise
as
a
bat
doth
be
of
this
age
in
that
it
did
have
no
feathers
and
truly
it
lookt
mighty
where
it
did
be
spread
and
indeed
the
body
to
be
full
so
big
as
the
body
of
a
young
horse
and
the
bill
to
be
very
deadly
and
sharp
and
cumbrous
as
you
to
have
guessed
and
i
to
be
all
and
utter
thankful
that
it
did
be
there
dead
in
the
stead
of
mine
own
body
and
the
thing
yet
to
twitch
and
stir
a
little
as
the
life
did
go
from
it
and
surely
i
was
back
then
very
speedy
to
the
maid
and
she
to
be
kneeled
upward
to
watch
me
and
i
took
her
into
mine
arms
and
lookt
well
about
and
made
then
forward
again
and
about
the
middle
part
of
the
sixth
hour
of
crossing
that
rocky
land
i
saw
that
we
did
draw
near
unto
the
shallow
river
that
you
shall
mind
i
came
over
after
that
i
had
done
with
the
olden
flying
ship
and
in
all
that
time
since
the
birdmonster
to
come
after
us
i
had
seen
but
two
more
and
they
a
great
way
off
so
that
i
guessed
that
i
was
come
beyond
that
part
where
they
did
go
very
frequent
and
i
to
wade
over
the
river
and
to
carry
mine
own
upon
one
arm
the
while
that
i
did
sound
my
way
with
the
staff
of
the
diskos
and
truly
i
came
across
very
easy
save
that
i
did
have
to
go
around
somewhat
where
that
the
river
did
seem
to
have
a
deep
place
and
when
that
we
had
crost
the
river
it
did
be
full
one
and
twenty
hours
since
that
we
slumbered
as
you
shall
know
if
that
you
but
count
a
little
for
you
do
mind
that
we
spent
a
certain
time
within
the
tree
as
i
have
told
and
this
not
to
have
been
proper
counted
into
the
time
of
our
journeying
and
surely
the
maid
to
have
been
very
quiet
since
that
i
did
show
my
strength
a
little
to
her
when
that
i
made
her
to
lie
that
she
be
safe
from
the
bill
of
the
birdmonster
but
she
not
to
be
anywise
in
anger
upon
me
but
only
as
i
do
think
that
the
woman
in
her
did
be
something
fresh
waked
unto
me
and
she
to
be
very
content
that
she
be
quiet
in
mine
arms
now
the
place
that
we
were
come
to
was
much
spread
with
boulders
but
yet
to
have
the
beginnings
again
of
the
forests
as
you
to
remember
for
i
to
have
made
some
small
remark
of
the
land
in
this
part
upon
mine
outward
way
and
we
lookt
about
for
a
firehole
that
i
should
dry
my
lower
garments
and
truly
we
had
not
past
many
in
a
great
while
but
we
to
be
in
fortune
that
we
came
soon
upon
a
little
firehill
that
did
be
no
more
than
so
high
as
a
man
and
to
have
the
rock
all
hot
about
so
that
this
did
be
a
good
place
to
our
purpose
and
i
kist
the
maid
and
set
her
down
out
of
mine
arms
and
when
that
i
had
lookt
well
about
and
seen
that
there
did
be
naught
to
our
sight
to
give
us
to
fear
the
maid
to
help
me
with
mine
armour
and
afterward
with
my
garments
and
to
ease
me
all
ways
that
she
could
think
of
with
helpfulness
and
she
set
the
garments
of
my
lower
parts
to
dry
and
whilst
that
they
did
be
drying
she
to
make
ready
the
water
and
the
tablets
and
to
have
me
to
sit
beside
her
in
my
bodyvest
and
gear
and
we
to
eat
and
drink
very
comfortable
in
the
warm
hollow
that
was
something
anigh
to
the
small
firehill
now
truly
i
did
be
very
hungry
that
time
and
indeed
to
be
alway
so
for
the
tablets
did
be
very
unfilling
to
the
belly
as
you
do
well
know
from
my
tellings
and
when
that
i
did
be
finished
i
saw
that
the
maid
lookt
at
me
somewise
oddways
and
sudden
she
to
come
into
laughter
and
askt
me
whether
that
i
did
be
very
empty
and
in
the
same
moment
there
to
be
a
wondrous
dear
look
within
her
eyes
so
that
i
perceived
that
there
went
a
mothernote
under
her
impudence
and
she
to
yearn
as
i
could
know
that
she
have
some
way
to
feed
me
but
truly
there
did
be
no
way
for
we
thought
not
to
make
to
slay
aught
for
our
purpose
and
we
did
be
feared
that
we
eat
any
root
or
plant
lest
that
we
be
ill
and
this
to
seem
strange
to
my
spirit
of
this
our
age
but
to
be
natural
unto
that
so
that
i
do
think
i
did
be
so
long
bred
from
the
primal
obtaining
of
food
that
i
did
be
all
lost
to
that
which
should
seem
natural
unto
the
peoples
of
this
early
age
of
the
world
though
we
truly
to
think
that
the
world
doth
even
now
be
old
and
this
to
have
seemed
a
true
thing
unto
every
age
that
ever
did
live
now
beside
that
we
did
lack
somewise
to
think
serious
that
we
slay
something
to
eat
in
that
the
tablets
did
actually
suffice
to
our
strength
i
to
believe
that
there
did
be
some
other
reason
that
i
do
forget
and
mayhap
never
to
have
thought
plain
upon
but
which
to
be
set
within
me
as
an
instinct
as
we
do
say
and
this
to
mean
if
that
i
try
to
set
it
in
other
words
that
the
tablets
did
keep
the
body
and
the
spirit
in
such
condition
that
the
forces
of
evil
did
have
the
less
power
to
act
upon
us
yet
have
i
no
remembering
that
i
was
taught
in
the
preparation
that
i
eat
naught
save
the
tablets
and
this
mayhap
never
to
have
been
set
upon
me
but
to
have
been
as
a
thing
that
doth
never
need
to
have
been
told
even
as
you
shall
not
tell
a
grown
man
in
this
age
that
he
shall
refrain
from
dung
and
eat
only
wholesome
matter
and
truly
i
to
hope
that
i
have
made
this
thing
somewise
clear
unto
you
for
indeed
it
doth
be
something
hard
to
set
out
for
every
age
hath
the
subtleties
peculiar
to
that
age
and
these
to
be
hard
to
the
understanding
of
other
ages
but
yet
to
seem
plain
and
utter
natural
even
without
thought
unto
the
peoples
of
the
age
and
surely
all
this
to
be
plain
to
you
and
to
be
overplain
for
in
verity
i
tell
to
you
and
overtell
until
that
i
should
be
weary
and
mayhap
you
to
be
the
more
so
and
indeed
i
not
to
blame
you
but
only
to
hope
that
your
understanding
which
doth
mean
also
in
general
your
hearts
doth
be
with
me
all
along
my
way
and
indeed
this
my
tale
to
be
not
easy
told
and
in
verity
i
to
be
back
now
unto
the
maid
alaugh
upon
me
and
in
the
same
moment
deeply
loving
and
alack
that
she
could
not
feed
me
and
i
to
laugh
with
her
and
to
have
understanding
with
her
as
you
to
know
and
indeed
i
to
have
an
heart
that
doth
be
made
someways
natural
unto
understanding
so
that
even
though
i
be
dead
when
you
read
this
my
tale
you
to
feel
that
we
be
friends
and
to
know
that
could
i
meet
with
you
in
pitiful
trouble
i
to
have
understanding
and
love
to
you
if
that
you
be
not
utter
brutish
and
evenso
i
to
be
sorrowful
that
you
should
be
brutish
and
to
have
understanding
in
that
i
to
know
that
by
developement
you
to
become
wise
unto
sweetness
and
charity
and
in
love
with
all
dear
things
and
kind
pity
of
the
rest
and
thiswise
you
to
be
in
human
sympathy
with
me
because
that
you
do
feel
that
i
be
honest
with
you
and
somewise
even
now
to
your
elbow
as
you
read
and
this
to
be
writ
now
and
you
mayhap
not
to
be
born
a
great
while
yet
but
in
the
end
to
read
and
to
have
understanding
with
me
and
to
know
how
i
did
love
mine
own
and
so
we
to
go
forward
again
the
closer
in
that
we
do
be
the
more
knit
in
dear
human
sympathy
and
surely
the
maid
kist
me
very
nice
on
the
lips
and
did
promise
again
how
that
she
should
make
me
a
great
meal
when
that
we
did
come
to
our
mighty
home
and
indeed
as
she
to
say
she
to
join
with
me
and
we
both
to
be
naughty
gluttons
for
that
once
and
surely
i
laughed
gently
at
the
maid
because
that
she
should
be
so
dainty
a
glutton
but
for
my
part
i
to
feel
that
i
could
eat
an
horse
as
we
do
say
in
this
age
and
by
that
we
had
eat
and
drunk
and
talked
awhile
and
lookt
oft
about
so
that
we
know
that
no
brutish
thing
came
near
to
our
hurt
the
maid
to
tell
me
that
my
garments
did
be
dry
and
she
then
to
give
me
aid
that
i
dress
very
quick
and
afterward
she
to
help
me
with
mine
armour
the
which
she
did
wipe
after
that
we
had
eat
and
drunk
and
she
to
have
had
joy
that
she
do
this
thing
and
all
things
for
me
and
to
have
used
a
part
of
her
torn
garments
to
this
end
and
so
truly
i
to
be
clothed
and
armed
very
speedy
and
to
feel
eased
and
the
more
sure
in
my
mind
for
in
verity
i
was
alway
in
unease
when
that
i
did
not
be
ready
that
i
be
able
to
meet
any
horrid
brute
that
should
be
like
to
come
upon
us
now
when
that
i
did
be
into
mine
armour
again
the
maid
to
set
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
upon
me
and
all
the
while
i
scarce
to
be
loosed
of
the
diskos
as
ever
and
we
then
to
our
way
which
did
be
that
we
find
a
place
proper
to
our
slumber
and
when
that
we
did
be
gone
allways
and
no
cave
proper
to
our
sight
we
found
a
great
tree
that
did
be
set
off
alone
and
had
a
plenty
of
branches
but
none
that
did
be
near
to
the
bottompart
and
surely
i
gave
the
maid
a
lift
and
held
her
up
so
far
as
mine
arms
did
go
so
that
she
might
stand
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
and
be
steady
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
she
thiswise
to
have
a
hold
upon
a
branch
and
so
to
go
upward
and
truly
when
that
she
was
safe
i
loosed
one
of
the
straps
from
the
pouch
and
the
scrip
and
i
cast
this
up
to
the
maid
and
she
set
it
strong
about
the
branch
and
when
i
had
caught
the
downward
end
i
went
upward
very
easy
and
afterward
took
loose
the
strap
and
this
way
we
did
be
something
safe
as
you
shall
see
and
we
climbed
upward
then
and
so
came
to
a
part
of
the
tree
where
the
branches
did
be
very
thick
together
and
we
made
here
a
place
for
our
slumber
and
the
maid
set
the
cloak
over
the
branches
that
did
be
so
close
and
afterward
we
lay
down
but
first
i
set
the
strap
about
her
waist
and
thence
to
a
branch
and
she
to
refuse
sleep
until
that
i
be
likewise
so
that
we
did
be
both
very
safe
from
any
fall
and
she
kist
me
and
we
then
to
our
slumber
and
very
weary
for
it
did
be
two
and
twenty
hours
by
this
since
that
we
had
sleep
now
we
had
eight
hours
in
which
we
slept
utter
and
we
both
to
awake
as
it
did
seem
in
the
same
moment
but
truly
i
to
think
that
mine
own
did
be
wakeful
before
that
time
for
indeed
as
she
put
her
arms
very
dainty
about
my
neck
that
she
kiss
me
i
did
have
a
quick
and
sudden
knowledge
that
i
had
been
kist
oft
in
my
sleep
and
this
to
have
been
but
a
little
while
gone
and
surely
it
did
seem
to
me
that
mine
own
did
have
a
sweet
and
contented
mischief
inward
of
her
eyes
but
yet
she
to
be
very
sedate
outward
and
to
kiss
me
loving
and
dear
and
then
we
to
our
breakfast
upon
the
cloak
and
afterward
i
climbed
to
the
topmost
branches
of
the
tree
and
lookt
well
over
the
country
all
about
but
there
was
no
brutish
thing
to
my
sight
in
any
place
neither
near
nor
far
and
i
came
down
then
to
the
maid
and
told
her
how
that
there
was
quietness
of
life
all
about
and
we
had
our
gear
together
and
went
downward
to
the
earth
and
i
to
help
mine
own
and
this
way
she
to
be
safe
now
as
we
went
forward
upon
our
journeying
i
perceived
that
the
maid
had
a
wayward
air
and
truly
i
thought
that
she
did
have
her
heart
all
set
toward
naughtiness
and
mischief
and
in
the
same
moment
that
i
was
in
this
belief
i
did
know
in
mine
understanding
that
this
did
spring
from
the
workings
of
my
nature
upon
the
nature
of
mine
own
maiden
and
naani
to
walk
in
the
first
beside
me
and
to
have
no
word
for
me
because
that
she
did
be
so
filled
with
the
stirrings
of
her
naughtiness
that
did
be
in
the
same
moment
very
sweet
unto
me
and
yet
to
waken
all
that
did
be
masterful
within
me
and
she
to
be
that
she
did
know
and
to
delight
in
her
secret
heart
that
she
waken
that
which
did
be
masterful
in
me
but
yet
in
the
same
moment
to
be
strong
determined
that
she
be
not
mastered
by
me
and
surely
this
to
seem
contrarywise
in
the
words
but
to
be
clear
to
the
heart
if
indeed
you
have
ever
been
loved
by
a
dear
maid
of
an
high
spirit
and
above
all
this
the
maid
did
be
filled
with
a
love
for
me
that
did
beat
and
dance
in
all
her
being
and
this
in
truth
to
overweigh
all
but
yet
from
this
same
thing
her
dainty
naughtiness
to
be
born
because
as
i
did
say
my
manhood
to
stir
all
her
nature
upwise
in
sweet
trouble
that
did
be
half
of
rebellion
and
half
that
she
did
ache
that
she
be
close
unto
me
in
mine
arms
and
in
verity
you
to
be
with
me
in
all
these
things
if
that
you
have
had
the
lovedays
beside
a
dear
and
dainty
maid
of
an
high
and
pure
and
natural
spirit
so
that
if
you
be
old
these
days
even
but
the
light
merriment
of
a
passing
maiden
to
bring
a
pain
of
wonderings
and
golden
memories
upon
your
heart
and
presently
i
saw
that
mine
own
put
a
little
space
between
us
as
the
naughtiness
did
work
in
her
as
my
heart
to
know
and
she
to
be
offward
from
me
a
little
and
she
still
to
have
no
speech
with
me
but
in
a
little
to
begin
that
she
sing
in
a
low
voice
and
to
have
her
pretty
body
very
upright
and
lithesome
and
to
go
forward
with
a
wondrous
dainty
swing
so
that
my
heart
told
me
that
she
did
all
be
stirred
with
small
thrillings
of
defiance
unto
me
and
with
thrillings
of
love
and
she
to
have
the
triumph
of
her
maidenhood
and
of
her
womanhood
as
it
were
both
to
contend
in
her
and
to
thrill
upon
her
tongue
and
to
show
out
the
lilting
and
pretty
warfare
of
her
spirit
that
did
go
dancing
and
dearly
naughty
in
her
breast
and
surely
i
went
very
lifted
in
my
heart
and
astir
for
it
did
be
wondrous
to
me
that
this
lovely
maid
did
be
so
utter
mine
and
to
see
but
the
way
that
she
set
her
feet
to
the
earth
and
the
way
that
she
did
lift
them
sure
and
dainty
and
the
way
that
her
body
did
be
poised
and
the
way
of
her
head
and
the
way
of
her
naughtiness
and
the
sweetness
and
the
love
that
did
be
wrapt
in
with
all
did
make
me
want
that
i
have
her
in
mine
arms
but
yet
i
not
to
do
this
because
that
in
the
same
time
that
she
did
so
stir
me
to
love
and
admirings
she
to
set
somewhat
else
in
me
at
variance
so
that
i
did
half
to
feel
stern
with
her
for
i
perceived
that
she
had
that
naughtiness
then
within
her
that
she
did
be
like
to
have
a
real
intent
of
impertinence
unto
me
so
that
she
should
be
naughtily
outrageous
and
to
have
no
heed
to
my
advisings
neither
unto
my
desires
unless
that
i
set
my
hand
upon
her
to
make
her
to
obey
and
truly
you
that
have
had
dear
maids
shall
follow
mine
explainings
but
unto
others
i
know
not
whether
they
shall
understand
until
they
too
have
been
possessed
of
one
that
shall
set
all
their
heart
adrift
even
as
this
one
that
did
be
mine
own
and
sudden
i
to
know
that
naani
did
change
from
her
low
singing
unto
an
olden
air
that
had
surely
not
been
heard
in
all
that
eternity
and
in
verity
for
a
little
while
i
not
to
know
why
that
it
did
so
shake
all
my
heart
nor
what
it
did
be
nor
whether
that
i
had
truly
heard
it
before
or
only
to
think
so
and
surely
it
did
be
as
that
the
silence
of
the
olden
moonlit
world
did
steal
all
about
me
and
sudden
i
to
know
that
the
maid
did
sing
an
olden
lovesong
of
the
olden
world
and
to
go
halting
a
little
as
she
sang
because
that
the
words
did
steal
something
oddwise
through
the
far
veils
of
her
memory
even
as
a
song
doth
come
backward
out
of
dreams
and
i
to
feel
all
my
blood
to
seem
to
tremble
in
my
veins
and
my
throat
to
be
troubled
as
with
vague
sobs
that
did
be
the
ghosts
of
forgotten
tears
and
the
dim
sorrow
that
had
come
so
swift
and
strange
upon
me
to
be
likewise
steeped
in
golden
mists
of
the
love
that
i
once
did
love
and
the
glamour
to
be
come
all
fresh
upon
me
and
i
to
know
in
that
moment
how
much
we
do
forget
even
when
that
we
do
believe
that
we
have
all
memory
and
all
sorrow
within
our
hearts
and
i
lookt
unto
the
maid
something
dimly
because
of
the
way
that
i
did
be
and
i
perceived
in
a
moment
that
mine
own
did
weep
as
she
walked
but
the
less
with
pain
than
with
the
strange
anguish
of
memory
that
doth
have
in
it
tenderness
and
sorrow
and
love
and
all
that
hath
been
and
all
that
did
never
be
and
all
to
make
a
vale
unto
the
spirit
where
doth
be
both
a
dim
greyness
and
a
warm
and
everlasting
light
and
an
utter
speechlessness
and
the
low
and
far
music
of
forgotten
songs
that
do
come
downward
over
the
shadowy
mountains
that
do
be
builded
of
years
and
forgetfulness
and
yet
made
to
be
seen
with
the
light
of
that
our
memory
which
doth
cast
so
many
husht
shadows
and
surely
as
i
did
say
the
maid
did
weep
as
she
went
but
not
to
be
cast
down
but
rather
that
she
held
her
head
upwise
as
that
she
did
walk
in
a
glory
and
the
song
to
come
oftbroke
and
oddly
and
to
set
her
voice
to
little
human
quiverings
as
her
memory
did
shake
her
sweet
spirit
unto
tears
afresh
and
she
to
walk
with
her
pretty
head
upheld
and
as
that
she
did
go
in
a
triumph
and
the
tears
to
come
down
strangely
upon
her
face
and
all
her
soul
to
be
there
pure
and
wondrous
and
in
the
same
time
both
troubled
and
glad
and
this
thing
to
be
very
dear
and
amazing
and
she
to
be
as
that
she
not
to
know
then
that
she
sang
but
as
that
she
did
be
lost
in
her
thoughts
as
we
do
say
and
this
to
have
come
sudden
upon
her
out
of
all
her
upliftedness
of
spirit
that
had
been
like
to
make
her
very
open
unto
all
subtile
and
subtle
powers
of
thought
and
inward
stirrings
as
you
shall
think
and
again
the
song
to
come
fullremembered
and
fresh
as
that
this
eternity
did
be
but
the
yesterday
of
that
moment
and
mine
own
to
be
all
in
a
sweet
madness
with
those
halfdreamed
memories
and
the
wonder
and
pain
of
all
that
no
man
hath
ever
said
and
that
shall
be
never
said
and
of
the
utter
lost
years
and
all
that
hath
been
lost
and
all
forgotten
greatness
and
splendour
and
the
dreadfulness
of
parting
and
the
loveliness
of
beautiful
things
that
do
be
hid
in
the
abyss
of
the
years
and
it
did
be
sudden
to
my
quickened
fancy
that
there
did
be
low
echoes
all
about
us
of
the
voices
of
dear
beautiful
ones
that
have
died
for
so
did
memory
set
a
strange
and
lovely
mystery
about
my
spirit
in
that
moment
that
i
did
be
all
shaken
so
much
as
mine
own
and
i
to
be
as
that
i
drew
my
breath
anigh
to
tears
and
did
be
there
with
naani
amid
the
quiet
spareness
of
the
trees
and
the
rock
of
that
part
of
the
land
but
yet
did
be
to
see
half
dimly
that
i
stood
within
a
light
even
as
the
light
that
doth
be
the
wonder
of
olden
sunsets
and
i
to
be
in
the
same
time
both
that
man
and
this
man
that
now
doth
write
and
to
have
beside
my
spirit
but
one
maid
that
i
did
lack
to
know
whether
i
say
to
her
naani
or
mirdath
for
though
the
two
that
have
been
mine
own
did
be
differentseeming
to
the
eye
there
to
be
but
the
spirit
of
one
maid
beside
me
in
that
moment
and
surely
i
did
be
there
all
shaken
unto
the
seeing
of
visions
as
it
did
seem
so
that
the
land
about
me
to
have
grown
half
as
that
it
did
lack
that
it
be
real
unto
my
sight
because
that
i
lookt
inward
unto
lands
that
did
be
of
memory
and
lo
in
a
moment
this
to
go
and
i
to
be
in
that
country
of
the
seas
and
to
look
newly
unto
naani
and
she
to
go
as
i
have
told
and
there
to
be
the
lonesome
trees
and
the
rocks
in
all
parts
for
a
great
way
about
and
sudden
as
i
lookt
at
mine
own
she
to
come
round
unto
me
and
she
held
out
her
arms
and
did
gaze
at
me
with
such
a
love
as
that
she
were
transfigured
and
to
need
strangely
that
she
be
in
mine
arms
and
surely
i
to
an
holy
need
that
i
have
her
unto
me
because
that
after
all
there
did
be
no
wonder
so
great
as
that
wonder
that
when
all
did
be
said
i
did
have
mine
own
after
that
all
eternity
had
nigh
past
and
in
verity
we
ran
each
to
the
other
and
did
be
silent
because
that
there
was
no
speech
of
words
by
which
we
could
say
aught
of
all
that
did
be
in
our
hearts
and
truly
you
to
be
with
me
in
understanding
for
you
too
mayhap
to
have
suffered
thiswise
of
dumbness
even
if
that
it
hath
not
been
so
great
but
yet
to
make
you
to
know
and
presently
we
grew
quiet
in
the
spirit
and
mine
own
to
come
back
again
to
her
joyousness
and
to
go
beside
by
me
as
we
made
forward
and
presently
naani
to
begin
that
she
look
at
me
with
dear
impudences
again
that
did
be
very
sweet
unto
me
but
yet
to
be
like
to
lead
unto
defyings
and
truly
by
these
things
shall
you
know
the
spirit
of
mine
own
maid
and
there
to
be
none
to
me
that
ever
did
be
like
her
but
indeed
you
to
think
thatwise
of
the
maid
that
you
did
love
and
all
the
world
to
be
thinking
each
these
thoughts
of
one
dear
maiden
that
doth
be
the
one
maid
in
all
the
round
world
and
this
to
be
the
lovely
niceness
of
the
human
heart
and
i
not
to
have
any
grumble
thereat
but
yet
surely
you
shall
say
that
this
maid
that
did
be
mine
own
did
be
very
dear
and
lovely
and
in
verity
i
to
show
my
human
heart
in
this
thing
for
you
likewise
to
want
that
i
think
your
maid
to
have
been
just
so
dear
and
the
more
so
and
indeed
we
ever
to
be
going
these
ways
and
to
have
good
comradeship
of
understanding
because
that
we
have
all
loved
and
suffered
joy
and
had
utter
belief
in
a
dear
one
and
surely
a
defyingness
to
come
presently
into
the
way
that
the
maid
did
go
and
she
to
walk
a
little
offward
from
me
and
truly
i
lookt
at
her
both
with
love
and
yet
with
somewhat
that
did
be
to
reprove
her
gently
and
all
in
the
same
moment
that
she
to
make
my
heart
stirred
with
her
sweet
naughtiness
and
she
to
look
sudden
at
me
and
to
be
that
she
half
to
intend
to
run
to
kiss
me
but
also
that
she
be
minded
in
the
same
moment
that
she
set
herself
up
impertinently
against
me
and
in
verity
she
made
me
to
harden
my
nature
a
little
as
manhood
doth
make
a
man
to
do
and
this
because
of
the
rebellion
that
i
knew
to
be
in
her
and
she
likewise
to
know
but
she
hid
her
eyes
when
that
i
shook
my
head
half
with
play
and
half
with
earnest
and
was
then
impudent
unto
me
and
gone
from
that
in
a
moment
to
her
pretty
singing
and
her
naughty
walking
apart
but
she
no
more
to
sing
an
olden
lovesong
now
in
a
while
we
past
a
basin
of
rock
in
a
place
among
the
trees
and
there
was
a
warm
spring
bubbling
in
the
rock
and
the
basin
to
be
full
of
water
very
warm
and
with
some
smelling
of
chemistry
and
the
maid
told
me
that
she
would
wash
and
i
to
think
it
a
good
place
for
that
end
and
when
i
had
tasted
the
water
i
found
that
it
did
seem
smooth
and
proper
for
our
intent
as
that
there
did
be
a
verity
of
an
alkali
in
it
and
truly
we
washed
and
after
that
i
was
done
the
maid
bid
me
that
i
turn
my
back
and
i
to
do
this
and
she
to
mock
me
very
naughty
whilst
that
i
could
not
see
her
and
to
seem
very
quiet
for
indeed
i
heard
no
splashings
of
water
though
i
stood
off
from
her
a
long
while
and
she
alway
to
say
naughty
things
unto
me
as
that
she
did
mind
truly
to
have
me
angered
for
indeed
she
did
have
a
plain
intent
that
she
mock
at
me
and
to
ease
not
her
wit
and
surely
after
that
i
had
stood
a
great
while
i
askt
the
maid
when
that
she
did
be
like
to
be
done
but
she
to
say
that
she
was
nowise
ended
of
her
toilets
and
i
knew
very
sudden
that
she
made
foolishness
upon
me
also
in
this
matter
and
i
turned
upon
her
and
lo
she
did
be
sitting
upon
a
little
rock
very
sedate
even
as
when
she
had
bid
me
turn
from
her
and
to
have
made
no
more
forward
but
only
to
have
been
there
at
ease
that
she
keep
me
turned
away
to
please
her
naughty
mood
and
all
the
while
have
a
double
liberty
to
have
impudence
upon
me
and
in
verity
i
did
be
a
little
angered
but
scarce
that
i
did
know
it
for
i
did
love
her
very
great
and
was
stirred
inwardly
with
her
dearness
and
that
she
did
look
just
thatwise
that
i
knew
not
whether
i
to
need
to
kiss
her
or
to
shake
her
and
truly
how
should
i
know
for
my
heart
did
ache
that
i
have
her
to
mine
arms
but
my
brain
to
say
that
she
did
go
overfar
in
the
joke
and
truly
you
to
see
that
i
did
not
be
unreasonable
neither
to
be
lacking
of
grace
for
indeed
i
do
think
that
i
was
swayed
allways
because
that
i
saw
all
the
dear
way
that
her
pretty
nature
did
work
and
to
conceive
of
her
mood
and
to
understand
and
be
stirred
but
yet
to
shape
a
little
in
my
manhood
unto
hardening
and
in
my
judgement
unto
sternness
yet
truly
i
scolded
mine
own
with
no
more
than
a
little
jesting
and
did
be
nice
and
gentle
with
her
because
she
did
be
so
dear
and
i
to
know
justwise
her
mood
and
the
cause
and
working
of
it
and
i
told
her
that
i
did
love
her
and
that
she
hasten
now
and
let
us
again
to
the
journey
but
indeed
she
only
to
make
a
face
at
me
so
that
i
did
be
near
like
to
shake
her
unto
sedateness
and
she
then
to
be
both
merry
and
a
rogue
as
we
do
say
and
to
stop
her
ears
and
again
to
sing
very
gleeful
and
all
so
that
she
might
not
hear
aught
that
i
said
and
surely
she
lookt
a
very
dainty
rebellious
one
and
i
went
then
straightway
to
her
and
took
her
hands
from
her
ears
and
i
kist
her
pretty
ears
very
gentle
that
i
not
to
deafen
her
and
i
kist
her
lips
as
she
did
sing
and
afterward
shook
her
that
she
be
not
such
a
sweet
torment
but
this
to
have
no
success
that
way
for
she
only
to
put
out
her
toes
to
be
kist
for
her
footgear
was
off
from
her
feet
and
indeed
i
laughed
even
as
i
made
to
frown
and
truly
i
kist
her
pretty
toes
and
tried
then
to
coax
her
to
go
forward
something
speedy
with
her
hair
and
to
be
ready
to
the
journey
but
she
only
to
sing
and
to
refuse
to
be
sedate
and
in
verity
in
the
end
i
caught
her
up
in
mine
arms
and
had
her
bundle
in
my
hand
and
so
went
off
with
her
very
sudden
with
her
hair
all
loose
upon
me
in
a
lovely
and
soft
shining
and
her
feet
bare
as
they
did
be
and
this
action
i
made
because
that
i
was
grown
truly
a
little
stern
with
mine
own
for
indeed
she
did
half
to
need
that
she
be
whipt
unto
properness
as
you
shall
think
that
have
seen
how
she
did
be
thiswise
only
because
that
her
nature
did
be
stirred
strangely
and
her
womanhood
and
her
maidenhood
to
be
all
unto
war
and
in
part
to
make
a
rebellion
against
me
that
she
did
know
glad
to
be
her
true
master
but
yet
she
to
be
thus
even
though
she
did
be
so
glad
and
this
to
act
so
that
she
did
be
in
the
same
moment
both
sweet
and
wise
and
yet
to
show
a
dainty
foolishness
and
a
true
naughtiness
that
did
make
me
to
feel
somewhat
of
a
real
anger
but
yet
did
have
me
to
know
that
all
my
being
did
be
stirred
by
her
so
that
i
did
think
with
one
thought
that
she
did
be
very
foolish
and
with
another
that
she
did
be
lovely
wayward
now
when
that
i
took
the
maid
up
so
quick
and
made
off
with
her
she
to
give
a
little
gasp
and
to
submit
to
me
with
a
quick
humbleness
but
immediately
she
to
regain
her
courage
and
to
be
outraged
of
me
but
indeed
i
took
no
heed
only
that
i
was
like
to
shake
her
and
did
know
also
that
her
hair
did
be
wondrous
pretty
upon
mine
armour
and
she
soon
to
lie
very
quiet
and
easy
in
mine
arms
and
to
be
demure
and
i
to
have
a
half
knowledge
of
somewhat
amiss
but
yet
to
have
no
sureness
neither
to
think
much
upon
this
vague
feeling
and
when
that
i
had
gone
a
good
mile
she
to
put
up
her
lips
to
be
kist
and
i
to
kiss
her
very
loving
for
she
was
so
dear
and
she
then
to
say
very
ordinary
like
that
i
should
do
wisely
now
if
that
i
went
back
for
her
footgear
which
truly
i
had
lacked
thought
to
notice
when
that
i
did
pick
up
the
maid
and
i
saw
that
she
had
known
this
thing
all
that
while
and
had
made
that
mile
of
carrying
all
a
waste
and
a
foolishness
because
of
the
naughty
rebellion
which
did
be
in
her
and
lo
i
set
her
instant
to
the
ground
and
she
gave
out
a
little
cry
as
she
saw
that
i
did
be
gone
somewise
hard
and
stern
with
her
and
indeed
i
pulled
a
small
branch
from
a
tree
that
did
be
near
to
be
for
a
switch
as
you
shall
whip
a
boy
with
and
i
held
her
with
my
left
hand
and
in
verity
i
laid
the
switch
thrice
very
sharp
across
her
pretty
shoulders
that
she
know
all
that
she
did
need
to
know
and
she
seeming
to
be
ceased
in
a
moment
from
her
perverseness
and
did
nestle
very
quick
unto
me
that
had
whipt
her
and
did
need
that
she
be
wondrous
nigh
unto
me
and
truly
how
shall
even
a
young
man
flog
such
an
one
and
the
maid
to
be
very
husht
against
mine
armour
and
to
resist
that
i
look
into
her
face
that
did
be
prest
so
anigh
me
but
presently
i
used
a
little
and
gentle
force
and
so
to
look
into
her
face
something
sudden
and
truly
that
one
did
be
smiling
very
naughty
and
dainty
to
herself
so
that
i
perceived
that
i
had
not
truly
whipt
her
enough
but
yet
i
could
harden
my
heart
no
more
at
that
time
for
in
verity
there
doth
be
a
strange
halfpain
in
the
bosom
if
that
you
have
to
flog
a
maid
that
doth
be
utter
thine
and
this
to
the
despite
that
there
hath
beenas
thenno
properness
of
anger
to
have
for
an
after
selfreproach
and
surely
i
to
have
done
this
thing
only
of
a
stern
intent
and
steadfastness
that
i
steady
mine
own
maid
unto
wisdom
but
yet
to
have
been
helpt
by
a
little
anger
because
of
the
thing
that
she
had
done
yet
alway
my
love
did
be
so
strong
that
mine
anger
never
to
have
aught
of
bitterness
as
you
shall
have
seen
and
to
understand
and
we
went
back
then
for
the
footgear
of
the
maid
and
she
to
be
very
husht
in
mine
arms
but
yet
as
i
perceived
not
to
be
quiet
of
an
humble
little
heart
but
only
of
the
chance
that
her
nature
did
be
stirred
that
way
for
the
while
and
truly
when
we
were
gone
back
the
footgear
did
be
there
to
the
side
of
the
pool
and
the
maid
gat
shod
very
speedy
and
would
have
no
aid
and
afterward
did
up
her
hair
very
tight
upon
her
head
to
have
it
utter
from
my
sight
and
this
to
be
for
a
perverseness
for
she
knew
that
i
did
love
to
see
it
pretty
upon
her
shoulders
or
if
that
she
must
do
it
that
she
do
it
up
very
loose
and
nice
and
truly
you
to
know
how
i
mean
only
that
i
have
no
skill
of
such
matters
but
yet
a
good
taste
to
admirings
if
that
the
thing
be
aright
and
i
to
say
nothing
as
i
looked
at
her
and
she
presently
to
make
a
quick
glance
unto
me
to
see
why
i
did
say
naught
and
i
shook
my
head
smiling
at
her
waywardness
but
she
to
look
away
from
me
and
to
seem
to
be
set
to
fresh
naughtiness
now
we
went
forward
then
upon
our
journey
and
alway
the
maid
to
walk
onward
from
me
but
yet
to
have
no
other
impudence
neither
to
sing
and
i
to
go
kindly
with
her
but
yet
to
think
that
she
did
lack
somewhat
to
know
that
i
did
be
truly
her
master
and
i
to
wonder
a
little
whether
she
did
know
proper
that
my
gentleness
with
her
did
be
not
of
weakness
but
born
of
understanding
and
love
and
the
more
proof
that
i
did
be
fit
to
possess
and
to
guide
her
and
truly
this
was
the
thought
of
a
young
man
yet
lacking
not
of
reason
in
the
bottom
part
though
mayhap
to
be
something
clumsyseeming
unto
the
mind
of
a
maid
and
to
be
very
human
to
my
years
and
you
to
have
been
likewise
if
that
you
have
tried
allways
with
a
dear
one
and
she
to
be
yet
overwilful
so
that
you
to
wonder
whether
she
did
truly
know
how
you
did
understand
and
surely
a
maid
doth
know
much
that
doth
be
in
the
heart
of
a
man
if
that
she
be
true
woman
in
her
own
secret
heart
and
oft
she
doth
know
more
of
her
man
than
her
man
doth
wot
of
himself
and
to
go
her
own
diverse
ways
that
she
search
out
and
bring
forth
and
waken
all
that
is
the
inward
being
of
the
man
that
she
doth
love
yet
when
that
she
have
stirred
you
in
the
deeps
that
you
scarce
to
know
she
to
be
all
fearful
and
in
the
same
moment
to
have
no
fear
and
to
be
in
rebellion
and
in
the
same
moment
to
be
most
strange
humble
and
all
to
be
born
of
love
and
nature
in
action
upon
nature
and
more
than
this
how
shall
i
have
learning
of
the
heart
to
tell
you
for
in
verity
there
doth
be
much
in
these
few
lines
if
that
you
know
to
read
and
surely
you
to
know
or
to
learn
but
if
neither
then
have
you
gone
short
of
joy
and
the
true
inwardness
of
life
now
this
way
i
did
be
as
i
have
told
and
the
maid
to
be
quietly
naughty
in
perverseness
as
also
i
have
set
out
yet
to
have
a
strict
mind
to
her
duties
and
to
go
now
wondrous
sedate
upon
the
journey
yet
alway
apart
and
likewise
when
that
the
sixth
hour
did
come
and
we
to
our
halt
as
ever
she
to
be
very
speedy
and
nice
that
the
water
and
the
tablets
be
ready
for
me
but
yet
to
have
no
word
neither
to
eat
by
me
but
again
a
little
apart
and
not
to
share
the
water
but
to
make
a
brewing
to
herself
when
that
i
had
done
and
likewise
the
maid
held
not
up
her
tablets
to
be
kist
as
alway
but
eat
them
quiet
and
meditative
and
with
little
nibblings
as
that
she
did
ponder
upon
other
matters
or
mayhap
to
be
not
hungry
and
these
things
i
saw
as
we
eat
and
drank
in
a
silence
and
i
to
look
at
the
maid
somewise
sad
in
the
heart
and
something
stirred
and
i
to
say
to
myself
wisely
yet
as
a
young
man
that
she
did
not
yet
be
taught
sufficient
that
i
was
her
master
and
this
you
to
perceive
and
she
never
to
seem
to
look
at
me
but
to
be
quiet
and
demure
and
to
have
her
eyelids
something
down
upon
her
eyes
now
presently
as
i
thought
upon
the
matter
i
saw
that
i
do
well
that
i
take
no
heed
of
mine
own
but
to
let
her
to
come
to
a
natural
end
of
this
naughtiness
that
did
be
in
the
same
time
both
pretty
and
a
little
foolish
so
that
in
half
i
condemned
it
and
in
half
i
was
stirred
and
alway
i
loved
the
maid
very
dear
and
had
a
good
understanding
and
there
to
be
also
an
interest
in
my
heart
at
this
new
side
that
she
did
be
showing
and
also
she
to
stir
me
odd
whiles
unto
masterfulness
and
so
you
to
know
pretty
well
how
it
did
be
with
me
in
the
matter
now
surely
i
found
this
plan
that
i
attend
not
to
the
maid
to
have
something
of
success
for
i
knew
presently
that
she
did
look
upward
at
me
slyly
from
under
her
pretty
eyelashes
and
after
to
be
demure
in
a
moment
and
this
to
go
forward
for
a
while
yet
i
to
show
no
heed
and
in
a
while
i
saw
that
she
gave
attention
to
her
garments
in
the
way
of
nattiness
and
afterward
she
took
down
her
hair
and
made
it
up
then
very
loose
and
pretty
upon
her
head
so
that
she
did
be
very
lovely
and
to
tempt
mine
eyes
that
they
look
alway
at
her
but
indeed
i
did
make
as
that
i
had
no
heed
that
the
maid
did
shape
her
hair
different
upon
her
head
and
she
very
soon
then
to
speak
and
to
have
the
lesser
gear
together
and
to
make
that
she
attract
me
but
truly
i
was
very
nice
with
her
yet
to
keep
her
now
a
little
off
from
me
in
the
spirit
and
so
to
teach
her
thatwise
that
she
was
somewhat
of
a
dear
naughty
maid
but
also
as
i
do
think
i
was
this
way
because
that
in
part
i
would
tease
her
in
great
love
of
her
prettiness
and
her
makings
up
to
me
and
so
maybe
even
that
i
make
her
to
be
the
more
defying
of
me
and
this
to
be
as
that
i
also
lacked
somewhat
of
reason
for
i
did
strangely
that
i
think
that
she
need
to
be
whipt
and
in
the
same
time
that
i
go
to
make
her
the
more
deserving
of
the
same
yet
this
to
be
the
truth
as
i
know
it
and
surely
to
be
the
natural
waywardness
of
love
but
yet
there
did
be
also
in
the
backward
part
of
my
wisdom
an
intent
that
i
be
wise
and
careful
with
mine
own
and
i
surely
to
have
no
full
realisings
that
i
did
be
like
to
set
her
further
unto
perverseness
than
yet
she
did
be
now
after
that
i
had
shown
well
that
i
lacked
to
heed
the
maid
i
found
that
i
did
be
looking
oft
at
her
and
she
to
be
so
dear
and
pretty
and
to
be
all
husht
that
truly
i
could
not
bear
that
i
be
longer
silent
to
her
advancements
and
i
ceased
then
from
pretending
and
would
have
had
her
into
mine
arms
but
she
to
be
now
in
sweet
dignity
and
to
keep
me
off
with
very
sober
graces
and
because
of
this
i
to
feel
someway
that
i
did
be
someway
in
blame
and
surely
now
that
i
consider
it
i
can
see
that
i
was
something
acted
upon
even
as
had
been
the
maid
and
so
we
two
to
be
and
a
most
human
pair
as
you
to
say
and
somewhat
both
alack
but
indeed
we
did
be
very
wholesome
and
in
utter
love
each
of
the
other
and
mayhap
both
then
to
perceive
something
of
the
sweet
foolishness
within
us
that
did
be
as
yeast
awork
in
us
for
i
thought
that
naani
did
smile
a
little
to
herself
but
surely
this
clearseeing
to
be
but
for
an
odd
time
and
afterward
we
each
again
to
earnestness
in
our
way
with
the
other
but
alway
even
when
we
did
make
to
show
indifference
we
to
be
something
troubled
inwardly
with
sweet
flashings
of
our
bewildered
natures
now
though
i
have
shown
you
that
i
to
know
that
i
did
be
not
utter
free
of
this
most
strange
and
natural
foolishness
yet
you
to
perceive
that
i
tell
this
only
that
i
have
utter
truth
of
all
things
that
did
happen
for
in
verity
because
that
i
was
something
subtly
touched
this
way
at
whiles
yet
was
this
no
full
excusing
of
the
maid
though
in
the
same
moment
you
to
perceive
that
there
did
be
only
the
half
of
me
to
think
that
she
did
need
to
be
excused
for
in
truth
mine
understanding
went
alway
in
the
main
with
the
workings
of
her
nature
and
had
a
natural
sympathy
with
her
dear
whimsies
but
also
as
you
to
know
i
to
be
stirred
constant
in
my
manhood
by
her
naughty
defyings
and
to
be
troubled
in
my
natural
sense
when
that
her
whimsies
made
her
to
act
that
she
be
likely
to
come
unto
aught
of
harm
and
surely
now
you
to
see
all
the
way
of
my
heart
and
to
have
understanding
in
things
that
do
follow
and
alway
you
shall
mind
that
i
did
love
her
utter
and
to
crave
alway
that
i
be
a
shield
unto
her
though
truly
there
doth
be
mayhap
somewhat
in
me
that
doth
act
to
make
me
a
little
stern
seeming
in
my
love
but
yet
not
oft
so
as
you
do
know
that
have
gone
with
me
in
all
my
tellings
now
we
went
then
upon
our
journey
and
the
maid
to
be
somewhat
before
me
and
offward
to
the
side
upon
my
right
and
to
have
no
speech
with
me
but
to
make
a
good
pace
and
to
be
very
dear
and
graceful
as
she
went
and
now
we
did
pass
this
thing
of
strangeness
and
now
that
and
these
i
did
point
out
to
her
and
made
some
telling
concerning
the
same
having
the
memory
of
mine
outward
way
and
how
that
i
did
see
these
things
then
when
that
i
was
all
in
suffering
of
so
lonesome
a
doubt
and
she
to
hark
alway
very
intent
and
to
move
her
head
nice
and
intelligent
to
show
that
she
heard
me
and
once
i
saw
that
she
lookt
sudden
at
me
with
a
dear
light
in
her
eyes
but
this
to
be
done
in
a
moment
and
she
to
be
again
silentseeming
and
in
her
new
perversity
of
dignity
and
surely
she
did
seem
so
utter
sweet
in
this
new
way
of
naughtiness
but
yet
i
did
think
odd
whiles
that
i
should
like
to
shake
her
unto
dear
humbleness
and
her
usual
way
and
in
the
twelfth
hour
we
made
halt
again
and
had
our
food
and
our
drink
and
the
maid
to
serve
me
very
clever
and
quiet
as
that
i
did
be
her
lord
and
she
an
husht
slave
and
i
saw
that
she
made
a
constant
and
naughty
mock
upon
me
and
truly
as
i
did
half
think
she
to
need
that
she
be
in
care
that
i
not
treat
her
sternly
as
shall
a
slavemaster
and
to
give
her
that
which
she
did
ask
for
so
mute
and
impudent
but
alway
she
did
stir
me
mightily
to
have
her
to
mine
arms
and
to
love
her
very
dear
and
presently
we
did
be
again
to
our
way
and
to
be
yet
silent
so
that
i
scarce
knew
whether
to
have
patience
with
mine
own
or
whether
that
i
take
her
and
speak
seriously
with
her
to
cease
this
play
which
did
begin
a
little
to
dispirit
me
somewhat
strangely
and
in
the
end
i
went
over
to
her
as
we
did
walk
and
i
put
mine
arm
about
her
and
she
to
yield
to
me
without
word
and
to
hark
very
quiet
to
my
speech
of
reasoning
and
gentle
sayings
and
to
hide
whether
she
did
be
stirred
inwardly
or
not
though
indeed
my
spirit
to
know
that
her
spirit
did
never
be
afar
off
from
mine
in
all
deep
matters
but
only
this
thing
to
be
to
the
top
and
to
set
somewhat
between
us
that
did
be
both
a
sweetness
and
a
trouble
and
alway
as
i
talked
with
the
maid
i
saw
that
she
did
make
naughtily
to
act
as
that
i
did
be
a
slavemaster
and
she
but
a
chattel
to
me
for
she
to
be
husht
before
me
and
neither
to
yield
her
slender
body
willing
to
mine
arm
nor
to
resist
me
but
only
to
be
still
as
that
she
had
no
saying
in
this
matter
and
as
that
i
was
like
to
beat
her
at
my
pleasure
or
to
withhold
my
hand
all
as
might
chance
to
be
my
desire
and
this
i
perceived
was
the
shaping
of
her
actions
so
that
all
her
dumbness
and
her
quiet
obedience
did
be
but
a
way
to
say
this
thing
to
me
and
all
to
have
come
from
her
love
of
me
and
that
she
did
be
shaken
in
her
nature
by
my
manhood
and
so
to
be
but
a
new
form
of
her
naughtiness
that
did
have
this
change
when
that
i
whipt
her
and
all
this
you
to
perceive
that
have
gone
with
me
and
i
saw
that
she
would
not
cease
from
this
perverseness
but
made
a
dumb
and
naughty
and
hidden
mock
upon
me
very
dainty
and
constant
and
scarce
to
be
truly
perceived
save
by
the
inward
sense
and
truly
i
grew
something
angered
afresh
and
to
feel
that
she
did
need
that
she
be
shaken
so
stern
that
she
come
unto
the
reality
that
i
did
be
her
man
and
natural
master
yet
alway
in
love
and
surely
i
loosed
her
then
and
went
off
a
pace
to
her
side
and
we
again
to
go
forward
thiswise
yet
she
soon
to
have
a
greater
distance
between
us
which
she
made
very
quiet
and
natural
but
indeed
i
saw
what
she
did
now
about
the
fourteenth
hour
of
that
journeying
i
saw
before
us
in
the
far
distance
the
rock
upon
which
did
be
the
olden
flying
ship
that
you
shall
remember
and
presently
as
we
came
more
nigh
i
lookt
oft
to
mine
own
and
i
saw
that
she
did
be
staring
that
way
and
to
be
in
wonder
but
yet
to
say
naught
to
me
and
soon
as
we
came
very
close
i
did
want
that
i
tell
her
about
the
ship
and
of
mine
adventuring
there
and
of
the
wonder
of
that
olden
ship
set
there
through
eternity
but
in
the
first
i
hesitated
as
you
shall
think
because
of
her
way
but
truly
my
heart
knew
that
her
heart
did
be
proper
unto
me
and
moreover
i
should
be
small
in
my
nature
if
that
i
let
any
pettiness
put
a
silence
upon
me
though
in
verity
if
that
the
maid
had
not
been
inwardly
loving
to
me
i
had
been
that
i
had
told
her
no
word
and
this
to
be
very
natural
whether
it
be
of
smallness
or
not
and
when
that
we
were
come
beside
the
great
uprising
rock
i
made
halt
and
the
maid
to
halt
with
me
and
i
showed
her
how
that
the
thing
upon
the
rock
did
be
an
olden
flying
ship
from
the
mighty
pyramid
and
in
the
first
she
askt
no
questions
but
did
be
quiet
and
but
to
show
with
little
noddings
that
she
did
be
greatly
interest
and
i
to
show
to
her
how
that
this
olden
ship
did
be
there
mayhap
an
hundred
thousand
years
and
to
have
been
there
as
it
did
seem
to
us
that
were
of
that
age
since
the
beginnings
of
the
world
though
in
verity
our
two
spirits
did
know
that
the
beginnings
of
that
age
did
be
truly
the
ending
of
this
as
you
also
to
know
and
much
i
told
mine
own
and
afterward
concerning
the
two
humpt
men
that
did
come
after
me
and
she
alway
to
be
silent
until
that
i
spoke
of
the
fight
but
then
to
come
round
upon
me
very
swift
and
with
a
dear
light
in
her
eyes
and
had
askt
before
she
did
wot
whether
they
did
hurt
me
and
surely
this
to
have
been
the
first
thing
of
her
olden
sweet
naturalness
that
she
did
say
for
a
great
while
and
i
to
be
so
in
delight
that
i
had
her
into
mine
arms
and
kist
her
very
loving
all
in
a
moment
and
she
to
submit
with
a
nice
gladness
and
to
nestle
unto
me
and
all
unwitting
that
she
did
be
gone
from
her
waywardness
yet
in
verity
she
did
be
a
naughty
maid
for
she
minded
in
an
instant
that
she
did
forget
her
pose
unto
me
and
lo
her
lips
did
be
no
more
to
search
unto
mine
but
to
be
as
that
they
did
be
kist
only
of
my
will
and
she
to
have
no
more
live
nestling
unto
me
but
only
to
be
quiet
in
mine
arms
and
i
lookt
into
her
face
and
her
lids
to
be
down
somewhat
over
her
pretty
eyes
and
she
did
look
very
husht
and
demure
so
that
truly
i
knew
not
whether
to
shake
her
or
again
to
kiss
her
but
in
the
end
i
loost
her
and
made
then
that
we
go
forward
yet
indeed
she
did
rather
stay
awhile
to
hark
further
concerning
the
olden
ship
and
of
mine
adventurings
but
she
did
then
to
mind
that
she
obey
as
a
slave
shall
obey
and
truly
i
did
punish
her
in
that
i
told
her
no
more
but
went
forward
at
a
good
pace
and
had
some
natural
wonder
how
that
i
deal
with
such
a
maid
if
that
i
spare
to
shake
her
and
surely
i
thought
then
again
that
i
leave
her
be
and
so
to
have
her
presently
again
to
her
old
and
natural
way
now
in
a
while
i
lifted
the
maid
into
mine
arms
that
i
carry
her
as
ever
through
the
last
part
of
each
journey
and
so
to
have
her
never
overtired
for
the
morrow
and
she
for
a
moment
to
resist
but
instantly
to
give
unto
me
and
to
lie
quiet
in
mine
arms
as
that
she
had
no
saying
in
aught
that
did
be
done
but
must
alway
obey
and
indeed
you
to
see
how
dearly
perverse
she
did
be
and
i
went
on
then
through
four
hours
from
that
time
and
lookt
oft
upon
every
side
and
walkt
quietly
for
truly
we
were
come
now
into
a
part
of
the
country
where
i
did
feel
that
there
might
be
near
some
of
the
humpt
men
but
i
saw
nowhere
anything
to
put
me
in
dread
and
alway
as
we
journeyed
there
did
seem
a
great
stillness
in
all
the
country
near
about
and
afar
off
the
low
mutter
of
the
great
firehills
in
this
place
and
that
and
a
drowse
as
of
life
and
warmth
about
us
and
everywhere
the
air
very
rich
and
plentiful
and
presently
when
that
we
did
be
come
down
from
that
high
place
where
did
be
set
the
rock
and
the
olden
ship
we
came
in
among
the
trees
that
came
very
nigh
to
the
shore
for
a
great
way
and
oft
as
we
did
go
there
were
clumpings
of
small
firehills
that
did
cast
fire
and
noise
and
oft
the
roaring
of
monstrous
springs
aboil
and
then
again
the
smell
of
the
woods
about
us
and
oft
still
in
odd
places
the
low
near
sound
of
a
little
firehill
that
did
burn
lonesome
in
some
clear
space
of
the
woods
in
this
place
and
that
and
afterward
we
to
be
gone
onward
again
into
the
dull
low
mutter
that
did
be
in
all
the
air
of
that
country
and
that
did
but
make
a
seeming
of
silence
because
that
it
did
be
so
far
and
constant
now
about
the
eighteenth
hour
i
to
note
that
the
noise
of
the
great
firehills
grew
more
loud
and
i
saw
presently
over
the
trees
afar
upward
in
the
great
night
and
gloom
that
did
lie
above
those
two
mighty
firehills
that
i
did
feel
to
make
the
earth
tremble
in
that
part
upon
mine
outward
way
and
surely
i
have
told
something
of
this
before
and
you
to
remember
if
that
you
but
think
a
little
moment
now
it
may
appear
strange
that
i
speak
thiswise
of
seeing
the
two
hills
of
fire
as
that
i
had
perceived
them
sudden
but
indeed
i
had
been
long
abled
to
see
them
both
yet
to
have
had
no
attention
to
them
because
that
they
did
be
a
great
way
off
and
because
they
did
be
but
two
hills
of
fire
in
a
country
that
did
be
plentiful
with
such
and
truly
i
not
to
have
said
aught
about
them
only
that
our
path
did
take
us
now
by
their
feet
and
i
to
see
them
as
it
were
newly
and
to
have
nice
ease
of
heart
to
perceive
how
that
they
did
be
a
wonder
unto
the
spirit
and
the
brain
for
all
time
for
it
did
be
as
that
the
earth
had
a
constant
shaking
within
miles
of
them
and
that
a
monstrous
force
of
nature
did
be
in
that
place
but
yet
there
to
be
no
desolation
around
as
you
should
think
but
in
all
parts
a
wondrous
growing
of
trees
and
great
plants
in
abundance
and
the
trees
to
grow
upward
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
mountain
and
there
to
be
no
falling
of
hot
rocks
and
ash
as
you
to
think
but
all
very
sweet
and
wholesome
as
that
the
mighty
valley
made
a
chimney
to
the
mountain
and
mayhap
to
others
so
that
their
waste
if
that
they
had
such
did
go
free
but
indeed
you
shall
take
no
heed
of
this
explaining
save
as
an
odd
thinking
that
hath
come
to
me
and
to
be
without
foundation
and
there
to
be
no
surety
of
the
reason
to
this
only
that
there
did
be
no
falling
of
ash
in
that
part
as
i
do
know
yet
in
other
parts
of
that
country
the
firehills
did
make
new
mountains
of
the
matter
that
did
come
from
them
but
this
not
to
be
alway
so
and
there
to
seem
to
my
knowledge
no
cause
to
order
why
this
did
not
be
constant
save
that
my
guessings
to
be
right
or
naught
to
be
blown
from
some
but
indeed
i
to
be
sure
only
of
that
which
did
be
plain
to
mine
eyes
and
mayhap
there
to
be
no
mystery
in
the
thing
but
a
score
of
natural
explainings
if
that
i
did
know
or
had
patience
to
think
long
enough
upon
such
now
when
that
the
eighteenth
hour
did
be
proper
come
we
to
be
anigh
to
the
great
hills
and
there
to
seem
nowise
any
danger
of
falling
fire
so
that
i
sought
about
for
a
place
for
our
slumber
and
i
found
a
cave
in
the
side
of
a
big
rock
and
the
cave
was
dry
and
comfortable
and
had
the
mouth
about
a
score
feet
above
the
earth
and
when
that
i
had
climbed
and
lookt
well
into
the
cave
i
gave
the
maid
an
help
and
had
her
safe
into
that
place
and
she
then
to
prepare
the
tablets
and
the
water
the
while
that
i
brought
up
a
boulder
from
below
to
set
very
light
balanced
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
this
i
meant
for
a
signal
to
fall
if
that
any
creature
should
climb
upward
into
the
cave
while
that
we
did
sleep
and
surely
you
to
know
this
plan
for
i
did
it
before
as
you
to
have
learned
and
the
maid
sat
near
to
me
and
eat
her
tablets
very
quiet
and
with
a
demure
naughtiness
but
yet
to
be
also
in
wonder
and
to
gaze
outward
at
the
great
firehills
and
to
be
in
awe
as
i
did
know
and
i
put
my
halfanger
and
my
play
from
me
and
told
her
of
mine
outward
journeying
and
how
i
did
go
by
these
same
mighty
firehills
that
did
seem
as
mighty
torches
to
light
me
in
my
search
and
to
have
held
a
new
strangeness
and
wonder
over
my
path
and
she
still
to
be
silent
but
yet
to
look
at
me
twice
or
thrice
with
a
very
dear
and
loving
way
though
she
did
hide
her
eyes
in
a
moment
when
that
she
saw
that
i
perceived
her
and
soon
the
maid
spread
the
cloak
for
our
sleep
and
while
that
she
did
this
i
lookt
well
about
for
any
creature
that
might
be
anigh
and
i
had
an
especial
thought
unto
the
humpt
men
but
indeed
there
was
naught
living
unto
my
sight
and
nowhere
did
i
see
anything
to
put
me
in
fear
for
our
lives
and
truly
i
had
a
great
viewing
from
that
place
for
we
did
be
in
an
upward
rock
that
stood
in
a
high
part
and
the
cave
to
be
twenty
good
feet
aloft
as
i
have
told
so
that
all
made
to
set
us
in
a
lofty
place
and
the
cave
to
look
toward
the
two
mountains
that
did
rise
upward
no
more
than
twelve
good
miles
off
from
us
as
i
do
think
and
the
country
between
to
be
somewise
as
a
mighty
park
for
it
was
spread
much
about
the
feet
of
the
great
firehills
and
did
be
bare
in
this
place
and
that
as
that
rock
did
make
the
earth
naked
there
or
the
falling
of
some
later
fire
to
have
wrought
thus
and
between
the
bare
parts
there
went
strange
and
romantic
woods
seen
mistily
and
in
parts
the
gleaming
of
waters
as
that
hot
lakes
did
be
half
shown
among
the
broken
forests
and
presently
the
land
did
go
upward
with
a
monstrous
sweep
and
was
then
in
great
terraces
in
the
height
and
trees
to
grow
very
plentiful
upon
the
mountains
in
sundry
parts
and
so
those
two
mighty
hills
to
go
upward
to
meet
the
everlasting
night
and
presently
to
show
strange
uplands
that
did
be
seen
very
wondrous
and
queer
in
the
light
that
did
glow
from
the
vast
glowing
of
the
fire
that
did
be
a
crown
upon
the
hills
that
did
seem
in
verity
to
be
that
they
burned
halfway
between
that
known
world
and
the
lost
olden
world
that
was
mayhap
two
hundred
great
miles
above
in
the
everlasting
night
and
eternity
of
darkness
and
i
lookt
upward
for
awhile
and
was
much
held
by
the
mighty
uplands
that
did
be
on
high
yet
did
lie
utter
far
below
the
burning
crests
of
the
mountains
and
showed
vague
and
sombre
and
dreadful
seeming
because
that
they
did
be
so
lost
upward
and
to
have
the
mystery
of
the
red
shining
and
of
the
shadows
upon
them
and
to
seem
to
slope
far
under
the
great
fires
but
yet
to
be
a
place
where
no
life
should
ever
come
because
that
they
did
be
so
monstrous
a
way
upward
beyond
the
great
shoulders
of
the
hills
the
which
did
be
themselves
a
huge
way
up
and
truly
i
should
give
you
somewhat
of
the
affecting
of
those
grim
and
unknown
uplands
if
that
i
said
they
did
seem
to
my
fancy
to
be
a
place
where
a
sorrowful
thing
might
wander
lost
forever
but
why
i
to
think
this
thing
how
shall
i
say
and
do
tell
it
to
you
only
because
that
it
doth
seem
to
hold
in
the
thought
the
grimness
and
utter
desolation
of
those
high
and
lonesome
lands
and
by
this
i
was
done
looking
and
turned
me
about
and
so
did
find
that
mine
own
did
stand
silent
and
waited
that
i
come
to
my
slumber
and
surely
i
lookt
at
her
but
she
did
have
her
lids
something
downward
when
that
she
saw
me
turn
and
so
in
the
end
i
said
naught
but
went
to
my
sleep
and
had
the
diskos
very
handy
as
ever
beside
me
and
i
then
to
know
that
mine
own
did
lie
down
beside
me
to
my
back
as
alway
and
this
to
gladden
me
as
you
shall
think
for
i
perceived
afresh
how
thin
did
be
the
crust
of
her
naughtiness
and
i
to
be
alway
stirred
and
touched
in
the
heart
by
her
loving
naturalness
that
did
need
alway
that
she
be
near
to
me
save
when
she
did
play
this
naughtiness
upon
me
along
the
way
and
i
saw
that
she
had
no
mind
to
be
perverse
whilst
that
i
did
slumber
but
must
now
be
nigh
unto
me
and
quietly
loving
though
nowise
truly
ceased
from
her
naughty
acting
that
i
did
be
as
an
hard
slave
master
because
that
i
had
whipt
her
yet
she
to
have
somewhat
a
truce
with
me
as
my
heart
did
know
but
indeed
she
not
to
kiss
me
goodnight
upon
the
mouth
in
her
dear
usual
and
sober
fashion
and
surely
i
did
lie
awhile
and
pondered
upon
the
maid
and
upon
all
her
ways
and
i
perceived
that
she
kist
me
not
only
because
that
she
did
not
be
able
to
break
utter
from
her
perverseness
that
did
come
from
the
stirring
of
her
nature
and
truly
i
did
love
her
and
was
half
minded
that
i
turn
about
to
her
and
take
her
a
moment
into
mine
arms
but
yet
to
abide
from
this
because
that
i
was
set
that
i
wait
awhile
and
to
bring
her
to
me
thiswise
mayhaps
and
presently
i
knew
that
the
maid
kist
mine
armour
very
quiet
and
shy
because
that
she
must
kiss
me
yet
to
be
intent
that
i
have
no
knowledge
of
this
pretty
act
but
indeed
i
did
know
in
all
my
being
and
did
be
newly
tender
unto
her
yet
to
say
naught
and
to
wait
and
thus
i
knew
presently
that
her
breathing
did
go
easy
so
that
i
perceived
that
she
was
all
content
and
gone
over
unto
slumber
somewise
as
a
little
child
that
doth
be
weary
and
doth
sleep
without
care
and
with
happy
assurance
and
in
verity
did
a
man
ever
to
have
so
sweet
and
gentle
a
maid
that
did
be
in
the
same
time
so
troublous
and
perverse
and
i
to
lie
yet
awhile
and
to
note
the
constant
tremble
and
shake
of
the
rock
that
did
be
under
us
and
this
to
be
alway
thus
as
i
did
lie
and
to
be
the
more
plain
because
that
i
did
be
quiet
in
thought
and
this
as
i
conceived
did
come
from
the
earthshaking
that
was
made
by
the
inward
fire
of
the
world
the
which
did
make
a
vague
trouble
in
all
that
part
of
the
land
and
then
in
a
little
i
was
gone
over
into
sleep
and
waked
not
for
seven
good
hours
and
then
to
hear
the
fizzing
of
the
water
very
brisk
and
cheerful
and
so
to
have
mine
eyes
open
in
a
moment
and
to
know
by
my
timekeeper
or
dial
that
was
somewhat
like
to
a
watch
of
this
age
that
i
had
slumbered
through
seven
good
hours
but
this
to
be
learned
after
that
i
had
lookt
to
see
whether
mine
own
did
be
well
and
whether
that
the
boulder
did
balance
in
the
mouthpart
of
the
cave
and
surely
there
did
be
nothing
in
harm
for
the
boulder
was
there
as
i
did
put
it
and
the
maid
a
little
off
from
me
and
did
make
ready
the
water
and
the
tablets
that
we
eat
before
our
journeying
and
i
rose
then
and
in
the
same
moment
i
did
know
that
my
mouth
had
been
kist
whilst
that
i
slept
and
the
knowing
to
come
to
me
vague
as
that
i
had
been
kist
in
my
dreams
and
i
lookt
over
toward
the
maid
but
she
to
have
her
lids
something
down
upon
her
eyes
and
to
seem
very
demure
so
that
i
saw
her
naughtiness
was
come
again
upon
her
yet
truly
i
could
not
bear
that
i
not
to
have
her
into
mine
arms
for
indeed
her
perverseness
did
seem
as
that
she
did
the
more
tempt
me
unto
her
and
thus
i
came
to
her
in
a
moment
but
she
neither
to
resist
me
nor
to
give
herself
unto
me
but
only
to
be
still
in
mine
arms
and
to
do
no
more
than
submit
very
quiet
and
because
of
this
i
loost
her
unkist
and
was
silent
and
a
little
to
be
angered
even
whilst
that
my
heart
perceived
the
way
of
the
working
of
her
heart
yet
truly
i
ached
now
that
she
come
back
to
her
dear
natural
fashion
and
i
eat
my
tablets
and
drank
some
of
the
water
and
the
maid
to
do
likewise
and
afterward
i
lookt
well
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
but
did
nowhere
see
aught
to
put
me
in
trouble
for
our
safety
though
truly
as
presently
i
saw
there
went
an
herd
of
strange
creatures
afar
off
in
the
northwestward
part
which
did
be
that
way
of
the
country
beyond
the
feet
of
the
mountains
toward
the
inland
now
when
that
i
was
something
assured
of
the
safeness
of
the
way
i
gat
the
diskos
to
my
hip
and
the
maid
to
have
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
ready
to
my
back
and
her
bundle
to
her
hand
and
so
all
to
be
ready
and
i
went
downward
from
the
cave
when
that
i
was
girt
and
gave
aid
to
mine
own
and
so
to
be
soon
upon
the
journey
and
surely
as
we
went
onward
and
i
to
look
about
me
with
differentseeing
eyes
from
my
looking
on
mine
outward
way
i
to
see
how
wondrous
this
part
of
the
land
did
be
and
how
that
it
did
be
truly
like
a
great
and
wondrous
park
that
did
be
made
of
the
skill
and
labour
of
godlike
things
and
truly
this
to
show
my
feeling
as
i
lookt
allways
and
all
that
part
did
be
bred
of
the
inward
forces
of
the
world
and
did
be
burned
clear
in
this
place
and
upheaved
in
that
and
made
to
an
hot
lake
in
another
part
and
odd
whiles
there
to
go
a
great
steam
fountain
that
did
whistle
a
lonely
song
forever
and
anon
there
to
be
a
small
wood
and
again
a
wood
and
oft
the
quietness
of
great
and
strange
trees
that
did
stand
alone
and
here
and
in
that
part
a
little
firehill
that
did
be
surely
no
greater
than
an
house
and
we
to
pass
seven
of
these
in
but
three
hours
and
two
to
glow
very
steadfast
and
to
make
no
vigour
of
burning
but
the
five
others
did
burn
very
strong
and
sent
out
a
smoke
and
ash
and
made
a
small
desolation
all
about
them
and
of
these
five
there
did
be
one
that
cast
stones
oft
and
again
so
that
they
went
upward
with
a
strange
loud
noise
and
fell
in
this
place
and
that
all
about
so
that
we
came
downward
more
nigh
to
the
shore
that
we
be
a
good
way
off
and
here
as
i
do
mind
there
was
a
strangeness
in
that
there
did
be
many
trees
that
had
stones
set
in
the
branches
and
this
to
be
plainly
the
work
of
the
little
firehill
and
i
to
think
it
but
something
new
come
else
surely
there
had
been
no
trees
within
all
that
space
that
it
did
throw
but
yet
mayhap
i
am
wrong
in
this
for
all
things
did
seem
that
they
grew
very
easy
in
that
country
and
indeed
this
to
be
for
surprise
to
me
only
that
i
saw
it
with
mine
own
eyes
as
we
do
say
and
alway
as
we
did
go
there
were
signs
of
inward
life
and
forces
so
that
we
but
to
stand
quiet
to
feel
that
the
earth
did
tremble
gently
in
many
parts
and
presently
there
sounded
for
a
great
while
a
low
and
dull
booming
sound
and
this
we
found
to
be
from
a
place
amid
certain
great
rocks
toward
the
mountains
for
there
came
thence
a
mighty
upspouting
of
boiling
water
that
went
so
high
as
an
hundred
feet
and
oft
to
be
thrice
so
high
and
belched
a
great
steam
and
there
went
up
in
the
jet
of
the
water
a
great
rock
that
was
so
big
as
an
house
and
did
dance
and
play
in
the
might
of
the
water
as
that
it
had
been
no
more
than
a
thing
very
light
and
easy
and
when
that
the
water
fell
as
it
did
oft
the
rock
to
go
downward
with
the
dull
booming
that
we
did
hear
and
i
minded
how
that
i
had
heard
the
booming
upon
mine
outward
way
but
had
been
then
something
more
to
the
shore
so
that
it
had
been
less
plain
to
mine
ears
as
you
shall
suppose
neither
had
it
been
then
to
my
sight
as
now
it
did
be
to
us
because
that
we
were
come
mayhap
the
half
of
a
mile
more
toward
the
inland
of
the
country
and
truly
we
lookt
awhile
at
this
huge
great
fountain
and
upboiling
and
came
nearer
unto
it
but
yet
to
be
a
large
space
off
because
of
the
way
that
it
did
throw
out
a
spattering
of
small
stones
odd
whiles
and
surely
the
thing
did
cough
and
roar
in
the
deep
earth
and
anon
to
gruntle
gently
and
to
sob
and
gurgle
and
lo
to
come
forth
in
a
moment
with
a
bellow
very
hollow
and
strange
and
the
great
rock
to
go
spinning
upward
and
all
ashine
in
the
light
from
the
volcanoes
and
was
so
round
as
a
monstrous
ball
and
polished
by
the
fret
of
the
waters
so
that
i
saw
it
had
surely
danced
in
the
great
jet
through
a
weary
time
and
anon
the
jet
to
cease
and
to
go
downward
with
a
great
soughing
and
thundering
of
waters
and
the
dancing
rock
to
fall
downward
from
that
height
which
did
show
very
huge
now
that
we
did
be
come
so
near
and
the
rock
surely
to
fall
backward
into
some
deep
pit
whence
came
the
waters
and
as
it
fell
there
was
again
the
dull
booming
but
why
the
rock
brake
not
i
could
not
perceive
save
that
it
did
alway
fall
into
a
boiling
up
of
waters
and
had
no
hurt
from
the
rock
of
the
place
whence
it
was
come
and
the
maid
and
i
both
to
have
stood
a
while
that
we
stare
at
this
thing
for
it
did
be
more
strange
than
i
have
made
you
to
know
but
now
i
did
make
to
our
journey
again
and
did
think
the
maid
followed
but
lo
in
a
moment
when
that
i
lookt
she
was
to
my
back
and
went
toward
the
great
boiling
fountain
then
i
stopt
very
swift
and
called
to
her
but
she
did
take
no
heed
of
me
and
went
onward
very
naughty
unto
the
danger
of
the
great
boil
of
the
jet
and
the
constant
flying
out
of
the
stones
that
you
do
know
now
even
as
i
stood
and
lookt
the
maid
drew
nigh
to
the
place
where
the
water
did
thunder
and
the
jet
in
that
moment
to
bellow
so
that
i
knew
it
came
upward
again
and
i
ran
then
after
the
maid
and
she
to
see
me
and
began
likewise
to
run
from
me
toward
the
monstrous
fountain
and
surely
i
did
think
that
i
had
done
well
if
that
i
had
whipt
or
beat
her
proper
before
this
time
for
truly
it
did
be
as
that
her
naughtiness
had
gone
nigh
unto
somewhat
that
did
be
near
to
a
wayward
madness
so
that
as
i
did
perceive
all
her
nature
did
surely
work
in
her
toward
some
deed
that
should
be
for
regret
and
this
to
come
because
that
she
did
be
something
pusht
from
her
dear
balance
by
her
loving
and
by
the
acting
of
my
manhood
upon
her
so
that
her
nature
both
to
be
in
rebellion
against
me
and
to
need
me
and
all
in
the
same
time
and
thisway
she
to
be
in
an
inward
turmoil
and
to
be
ready
foolishly
that
she
put
in
danger
her
beloved
life
if
only
thereby
she
to
make
me
something
adrift
and
in
the
same
moment
to
have
some
ease
of
her
perverseness
and
in
verity
you
to
know
all
this
because
that
i
have
shown
the
working
of
her
heart
to
you
before
this
time
now
i
caught
the
maid
among
the
great
rocks
which
did
stand
all
about
and
before
her
there
did
be
a
monstrous
pit
whence
came
the
upbursting
of
the
water
and
the
water
to
go
upward
before
our
faces
in
a
mighty
column
so
that
it
did
be
as
that
a
sea
shot
up
on
end
into
a
pillar
of
living
water
and
went
upward
forever
as
it
did
seem
in
that
moment
and
how
we
should
be
saved
i
knew
not
for
the
water
did
be
as
that
it
overhung
us
and
should
come
down
upon
us
and
smother
us
in
one
moment
forever
and
the
roar
was
in
our
ears
and
shook
all
the
air
of
that
place
with
sound
as
of
an
harsh
and
dreadful
thunder
and
there
was
a
scalding
of
beaten
water
as
fine
as
an
haze
all
about
us
and
i
had
the
maid
in
one
instant
into
mine
arms
and
i
ran
very
swift
with
a
fierce
running
that
i
have
her
away
speedy
and
so
made
forlorn
trial
that
i
save
her
life
and
lo
as
i
went
from
under
that
huge
and
dreadful
overhang
of
the
great
waters
there
came
downward
from
the
height
a
great
stone
that
had
been
cast
by
the
jet
and
it
burst
upon
the
rock
to
my
back
and
certain
of
the
flinders
did
strike
and
ring
upon
mine
armour
and
made
me
to
stagger
as
i
ran
but
i
held
the
maid
crowded
safe
against
my
breast
and
she
did
not
be
hurt
and
truly
i
was
yet
able
to
run
and
did
save
mine
own
and
brought
her
out
from
under
that
grim
spouting
and
i
put
the
maid
down
then
to
her
feet
and
she
not
to
know
how
near
that
she
had
given
us
to
death
neither
of
the
way
that
the
fragments
did
strike
me
for
she
laughed
very
naughty
and
gleeful
but
truly
i
laughed
not
for
my
heart
had
been
nigh
husht
with
terror
for
her
so
that
i
did
be
yet
sick
in
my
spirit
and
mayhap
also
something
shaken
by
the
blows
that
i
gat
from
the
broken
stone
and
in
verity
i
to
have
meant
that
i
flog
her
very
sharp
if
that
there
be
no
other
way
that
i
might
bring
her
to
reason
for
in
surety
as
you
to
see
she
to
be
acting
so
wild
as
a
child
and
so
unreasoning
as
only
a
maidinlove
and
i
to
know
that
she
did
have
to
be
brought
back
from
this
way
of
spirit
even
though
i
have
to
hurt
her
pretty
body
that
i
bring
her
again
to
her
dear
natural
wiseness
yet
indeed
i
could
not
whip
her
then
because
that
she
did
laugh
so
joyous
though
with
a
naughty
heart
and
did
look
so
wondrous
dainty
so
that
even
her
defyings
did
but
seem
that
which
my
heart
desired
and
you
mayhap
to
have
been
something
likewise
in
the
lovedays
yet
i
pled
and
reasoned
with
her
to
be
a
wise
maid
but
indeed
she
only
to
make
a
gleeful
mock
of
all
that
i
did
say
now
i
went
forward
again
for
i
was
not
harmed
by
the
stone
only
that
i
did
be
shaked
as
you
shall
think
and
the
maid
to
go
offward
from
me
and
to
sing
and
did
oft
dance
naughtily
as
she
went
but
truly
i
did
be
silent
with
her
for
i
was
but
human
and
did
lack
that
she
come
to
mine
arms
and
love
me
because
that
i
had
pluckt
her
safe
from
that
place
and
indeed
this
to
be
but
a
natural
desiring
and
you
to
have
understanding
with
me
and
to
know
that
you
also
to
have
this
lack
and
need
if
that
you
to
have
done
aught
for
love
of
your
maid
and
she
to
deny
you
a
word
of
loving
tenderness
yet
in
verity
i
to
be
even
then
able
to
perceive
with
mine
inward
senses
how
that
the
maid
did
have
a
wondrous
uppouring
of
love
for
me
but
yet
did
be
so
perverse
and
the
more
so
mayhap
because
that
her
love
did
so
urge
her
unto
loving
admittings
that
i
did
be
her
man
and
she
maybe
to
have
meant
that
she
be
the
more
humble
presently
but
yet
to
go
naughtily
awhile
more
and
not
indeed
to
have
had
the
power
within
her
at
that
time
to
have
come
unto
me
and
cast
off
her
waywardness
and
askt
that
she
be
in
mine
arms
as
all
my
heart
did
desire
and
so
as
i
have
told
i
went
silently
and
mayhap
with
a
little
dullness
that
did
be
part
of
anger
and
part
of
hurt
and
part
of
that
same
strange
lovefoolishness
from
which
the
maid
did
suffer
and
truly
this
doth
be
very
contraryseeming
only
that
you
have
seen
my
heart
and
all
indeed
the
more
human
that
it
doth
be
so
contrariwise
to
the
brainreason
and
all
to
be
desired
else
did
a
man
be
no
better
than
an
ant
or
a
weariful
machine
and
this
to
be
truth
and
wholesomeness
as
you
shall
perceive
if
that
you
look
deep
enough
and
do
modify
reason
with
heartunderstanding
for
in
verity
how
shall
that
which
we
call
reason
bring
any
to
the
full
and
the
great
knowledge
and
this
doth
be
a
power
of
holy
things
and
doth
be
a
child
that
is
born
of
love
and
reason
and
in
the
one
to
hold
the
two
and
to
know
all
things
is
the
gift
of
this
power
so
that
no
man
may
walk
truly
that
hath
only
the
first
neither
any
man
do
utter
wise
that
hath
only
the
second
and
surely
i
to
cease
from
these
thoughts
and
to
my
tellings
and
you
to
your
harkings
and
dear
sympathy
now
when
the
sixth
hour
did
be
come
we
made
a
halt
and
eat
and
drank
and
afterward
went
onward
again
and
so
came
presently
clear
of
the
two
monstrous
firehills
and
their
great
noise
to
be
presently
to
our
rear
and
likewise
that
quiet
country
that
did
be
round
their
feet
and
did
seem
so
utter
husht
and
strange
and
doubly
so
because
of
the
upward
noise
of
the
mountains
and
because
of
the
slow
and
subtle
earthshaking
that
did
be
so
constant
and
because
of
all
those
things
that
i
have
told
now
when
we
had
made
halt
the
maid
had
done
her
hair
very
uncomely
upon
her
head
and
had
lookt
slyly
to
see
whether
i
did
note
but
truly
i
took
no
heed
so
that
in
the
end
she
had
it
again
in
a
pretty
fashion
and
did
sing
naughtily
and
with
an
heart
of
mischief
as
she
did
shape
it
loose
and
wondrous
nice
about
her
head
and
i
still
to
have
no
word
for
her
neither
to
show
that
i
did
watch
her
with
love
and
somewise
a
quaint
pleasure
of
her
perverseness
even
whilst
that
i
did
strive
by
silence
and
an
aloofness
that
i
bring
her
to
my
side
as
she
did
be
in
the
first
days
for
truly
i
did
ache
that
she
be
near
unto
me
and
to
cease
from
her
waywardness
that
did
put
a
distance
of
spirit
between
us
as
you
to
perceive
and
so
we
did
go
forward
again
as
i
have
told
and
the
maid
did
strive
that
she
make
me
to
give
attention
to
her
naughtiness
for
she
did
walk
alway
offward
from
me
and
did
sing
aloud
and
truly
they
did
be
songs
strange
unto
me
but
yet
to
be
of
love
and
much
as
the
songs
of
this
age
for
truly
there
doth
be
but
one
song
upon
all
the
earth
and
she
but
to
sing
it
in
diverse
ways
and
she
did
oft
to
make
little
glancing
toward
me
and
did
pout
very
pretty
and
in
a
moment
come
something
toward
me
as
that
she
did
be
humble
and
would
be
forgiven
but
all
to
be
in
a
naughty
mockery
so
that
in
verity
i
lookt
not
at
her
save
odd
whiles
but
did
go
forward
alway
and
made
as
that
i
had
no
heed
of
her
doings
and
surely
this
did
presently
to
stir
her
to
a
new
defying
and
to
a
pretty
anger
for
she
did
sing
other
songs
of
impudence
that
she
did
fit
very
clever
about
me
and
this
way
to
have
a
constant
impertinence
and
so
we
did
go
and
i
never
to
speak
with
the
maid
but
to
wonder
when
that
she
cease
or
how
long
it
should
be
ere
that
i
did
run
swift
to
her
and
have
her
into
mine
arms
that
i
shake
her
and
kiss
her
all
as
my
heart
did
desire
and
when
that
the
twelfth
hour
did
be
come
we
made
halt
again
and
eat
and
drank
and
the
maid
to
serve
me
very
intent
and
hand
me
the
water
the
while
that
she
went
down
upon
her
knee
as
a
slave
but
when
i
would
have
laughed
gently
at
her
mockings
and
taken
her
into
mine
arms
she
went
from
me
very
sudden
and
cold
and
was
afterward
silent
and
did
sit
apart
from
me
now
i
also
did
be
silent
and
in
the
first
because
that
i
was
a
little
pained
and
also
because
that
i
did
be
new
touched
with
the
lovefoolishness
that
did
trouble
mine
own
but
afterward
i
ceased
from
these
feelings
and
did
be
intent
to
another
matter
for
it
did
seem
to
my
spirit
that
there
was
some
danger
anigh
to
us
and
i
had
a
thought
of
the
humpt
men
and
lookt
well
about
and
did
beckon
the
maid
to
come
nigh
because
that
the
trees
did
be
plentiful
thereabout
to
hide
any
creature
but
mine
own
came
not
over
to
me
so
that
i
loosed
the
diskos
from
mine
hip
and
went
that
i
be
nigh
to
her
and
she
made
that
she
saw
me
not
but
did
set
the
gear
together
and
had
it
presently
aready
for
the
journey
the
while
that
i
did
look
allways
among
the
trees
but
indeed
i
saw
naught
and
when
that
i
had
the
gear
upon
me
and
the
maid
her
bundle
we
went
forward
again
and
i
to
be
very
wary
and
bid
the
maid
keep
close
to
my
side
but
indeed
she
would
not
obey
and
went
offward
among
the
trees
so
that
i
was
all
anhaunted
with
dread
for
her
and
ran
and
caught
her
and
talkt
wisely
with
her
but
indeed
she
did
not
hark
to
me
but
did
run
off
in
the
moment
that
i
loost
her
and
i
caught
her
again
and
i
took
one
of
the
straps
from
around
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
set
it
about
her
pretty
waist
and
the
end
i
held
in
my
hand
and
so
had
her
to
obey
me
in
this
thing
which
did
be
needful
to
her
safety
and
the
maid
to
go
with
me
very
husht
for
two
great
hours
and
i
alway
to
look
well
about
and
in
the
end
of
that
time
the
maid
did
begin
to
sing
impudently
and
i
did
ask
her
that
she
be
a
quiet
maid
lest
that
she
bring
danger
upon
us
but
she
to
be
the
more
impudent
and
lo
as
i
did
strive
that
i
look
allways
lest
any
harm
did
come
upon
us
and
in
the
same
moment
to
reason
mine
own
from
her
pretty
folly
she
did
grow
very
husht
so
that
i
lookt
round
upon
her
in
an
instant
and
truly
she
had
cut
the
strap
with
her
beltknife
and
did
run
away
very
swift
among
the
trees
and
surely
my
heart
did
slow
a
little
in
my
breast
because
that
there
did
seem
something
amove
in
the
dark
of
the
shadows
where
the
trees
did
grow
thick
and
the
maid
did
run
that
way
in
her
foolishness
and
waywardness
and
i
ran
hard
after
the
maid
and
did
call
her
not
overloud
lest
i
bring
somewhat
upon
her
but
she
to
have
no
heed
and
to
run
very
light
and
swift
so
that
i
caught
her
not
for
the
half
of
a
minute
as
it
might
be
for
she
was
gone
ahead
and
i
did
be
a
little
cumbered
with
mine
armour
and
lo
when
i
caught
her
i
shook
her
and
pointed
inward
among
the
trees
for
it
did
seem
even
then
to
me
that
something
moved
there
but
she
to
struggle
in
my
hand
a
moment
and
afterward
to
be
still
and
to
ask
with
an
insolence
and
a
defiance
whether
that
i
did
mean
to
flog
my
chattel
the
which
she
did
call
herself
in
her
naughtiness
and
in
verity
ere
i
did
know
she
had
twist
from
me
and
did
run
with
a
true
wickedness
straight
toward
that
place
where
somewhat
had
seemed
to
be
amove
and
i
ran
then
with
all
my
strength
and
with
a
fearful
and
an
anxious
heart
and
because
i
put
all
my
strength
to
the
matter
i
caught
the
maid
in
a
moment
ere
she
did
be
gone
any
way
and
she
again
to
fight
to
be
gone
from
me
but
i
took
her
into
mine
arms
very
strong
and
i
ran
outward
from
that
place
where
the
trees
made
a
darkness
and
surely
when
i
was
come
again
to
where
the
trees
did
be
more
spare
i
saw
that
i
was
come
nigh
to
that
river
which
i
crost
on
the
raft
as
you
shall
mind
and
truly
i
did
be
glad
and
to
feel
safe
in
a
moment
yet
i
was
firm
now
to
my
purpose
for
i
set
the
maid
to
the
earth
upon
her
feet
and
kept
my
hold
very
sure
upon
her
for
i
did
mean
that
i
whip
her
before
that
her
lovefoolishness
bring
her
needless
unto
death
and
i
took
the
belt
from
her
pretty
waist
for
it
did
be
but
a
light
strap
and
i
whipt
her
very
sharp
over
her
shoulders
with
the
belt
and
truly
she
did
make
to
nestle
unto
me
in
a
moment
as
that
other
time
when
that
i
whipt
her
but
i
stayed
her
from
this
and
i
set
the
belt
thrice
more
across
her
shoulders
very
sharp
so
that
she
to
learn
wisdom
at
once
and
i
to
be
free
for
ever
of
this
need
to
pain
her
which
did
hurt
me
very
strange
and
the
maid
to
stand
very
quiet
now
that
i
did
keep
her
from
coming
unto
me
and
her
head
did
be
something
bent
so
that
i
knew
not
whether
i
did
mayhap
have
flogged
her
overhard
for
i
did
be
something
lacking
in
knowledge
whether
that
a
maid
be
very
easy
hurt
and
i
stooped
and
lookt
into
her
face
and
lo
she
did
be
smiling
naughtily
and
kist
me
in
a
moment
very
saucy
upon
the
mouth
ere
i
did
be
aware
and
afterward
she
laughed
and
made
try
to
make
a
bitter
mock
upon
me
and
askt
when
that
i
should
be
pleased
to
cease
from
whipping
my
chattel
for
that
then
she
should
run
away
immediately
into
the
wood
and
to
trust
the
humpt
men
that
they
protect
her
from
me
and
surely
i
lookt
at
her
very
grave
for
i
perceived
that
she
did
not
truly
jest
but
made
to
anger
me
and
did
be
half
in
a
strange
anger
herself
and
something
adrift
for
she
had
not
been
whipt
enough
but
only
to
stir
her
rebellion
utterly
and
i
saw
that
if
she
be
not
set
right
then
ere
she
leave
my
hand
she
to
be
like
to
have
some
new
foolishness
that
should
take
her
unto
her
death
even
as
she
had
come
overnear
already
as
you
to
know
and
this
to
be
because
that
her
nature
did
be
stirred
so
that
her
natural
wiseness
was
all
overset
and
she
to
be
that
she
do
aught
of
unwisdom
that
should
come
to
her
because
of
her
pretty
lovefoolishness
which
did
now
be
made
the
more
strong
by
reason
of
the
halfrising
of
her
anger
and
this
way
as
i
have
known
i
perceived
that
for
her
dear
sake
i
should
not
let
my
lovingness
weaken
me
in
that
moment
and
in
verity
i
shifted
my
hand
and
loosed
the
fastenings
of
her
garment
so
that
her
pretty
shoulders
did
be
bared
and
her
face
to
change
sudden
and
she
lookt
up
at
me
an
instant
with
a
little
gasp
so
that
i
knew
she
did
be
all
unbroken
as
was
mine
intent
but
she
did
not
yet
have
learned
deeply
in
her
heart
all
that
i
was
minded
that
she
to
learn
for
even
in
that
moment
she
made
a
sound
that
showed
she
did
try
to
mock
me
but
truly
she
did
not
know
in
that
instant
whether
to
mock
or
to
weep
though
she
did
try
to
suppose
that
she
had
yet
an
heart
for
mockery
and
i
set
the
belt
thrice
across
her
pretty
shoulders
where
they
did
be
bared
and
surely
the
blows
did
be
very
stern
and
sharp
and
lo
in
one
moment
mine
own
broke
into
an
utter
weeping
so
that
i
took
her
instant
into
mine
arms
and
did
hold
her
strong
and
gentle
against
mine
armour
and
she
to
be
as
a
child
in
mine
arms
and
did
sob
very
strange
and
bitter
as
that
she
did
be
all
undone
in
the
heart
and
presently
she
did
be
quiet
in
mine
arms
though
i
to
feel
how
she
did
yet
tremble
and
she
did
cling
tight
unto
me
and
her
face
to
be
against
mine
armour
and
afterward
when
that
she
had
ceased
to
tremble
i
kist
her
and
surely
her
mouth
did
be
very
humble
and
her
lids
to
be
downward
and
she
to
be
something
pale
and
she
then
to
be
awhile
more
in
mine
arms
very
quiet
and
so
to
come
unto
her
dear
self
and
lo
presently
she
to
want
to
kiss
me
of
her
own
accord
and
she
put
up
her
lips
very
sweet
and
as
a
loving
maid
that
i
kiss
her
and
surely
i
kist
her
with
an
humble
and
a
masterful
love
and
a
strange
pain
to
be
about
my
heart
as
you
shall
suppose
but
yet
my
heart
and
my
reason
both
to
approve
mine
action
and
the
maid
to
be
but
the
more
mine
own
and
to
have
come
again
to
her
dear
natural
wisdom
yet
as
you
shall
know
there
to
be
for
a
long
while
a
strange
and
mixed
pain
in
my
bosom
both
dreadful
and
tender
because
that
i
had
been
so
stern
with
mine
own
maid
so
that
even
while
that
my
heart
and
my
reason
did
approve
me
my
heart
to
make
somewhat
of
reproach
and
this
to
have
been
someways
of
foolishness
but
yet
human
of
our
nature
and
an
wholesome
trouble
to
the
spirit
if
that
this
troubling
be
not
allowed
to
shape
our
actions
to
any
harmful
weakness
now
in
a
while
the
maid
did
come
to
composedness
and
to
be
very
gentle
and
sweetly
natural
and
she
made
presently
that
she
would
have
me
to
loose
her
and
afterward
she
turned
her
back
to
me
even
as
a
dear
child
that
i
fasten
her
garment
again
upon
the
shoulders
and
she
did
be
both
shy
and
glad
and
humble
and
in
dainty
pride
of
submission
and
utter
mine
own
and
surely
as
i
did
this
thing
for
her
i
perceived
that
she
lookt
with
a
great
shyness
at
the
belt
which
did
be
yet
in
my
hand
and
when
that
i
had
made
an
end
of
fastening
her
garment
she
did
nestle
unto
me
for
a
while
and
afterward
stood
away
and
made
shyly
to
show
me
that
i
put
her
belt
again
about
her
pretty
waist
and
i
saw
that
she
did
be
somewhat
alack
yet
that
she
touch
the
belt
because
that
i
had
whipt
her
with
it
and
truly
you
to
perceive
how
her
heart
did
be
in
this
matter
but
if
you
not
to
know
then
how
shall
i
to
tell
you
and
do
but
bid
you
ask
your
own
maid
though
in
verity
she
to
be
like
that
she
but
laugh
at
you
and
leave
you
so
wise
as
you
be
now
for
the
way
of
the
heart
of
a
maid
doth
be
most
hid
to
the
maid
and
she
but
to
know
the
desire
and
to
lack
the
ending
but
truly
she
doth
know
when
that
a
man
shall
set
the
truth
of
her
heart
before
her
now
when
i
had
buckled
the
belt
very
nice
again
about
mine
own
we
went
backward
a
space
until
that
we
found
the
bundle
which
she
had
dropt
when
that
she
ran
off
from
me
and
i
saw
also
the
portion
of
the
strap
which
she
cut
and
so
all
to
be
found
and
we
went
then
at
a
good
speed
toward
the
river
for
i
was
still
minded
regarding
the
seeming
of
movement
which
there
had
been
among
the
trees
and
very
wishful
that
we
have
a
raft
made
with
haste
so
that
we
might
come
to
the
little
island
where
i
did
sleep
before
upon
the
outward
way
as
you
shall
remember
and
i
thought
to
have
our
slumber
again
in
that
place
and
to
make
that
days
journeying
something
short
because
that
the
island
was
near
and
a
good
and
safe
place
for
our
sleeping
and
i
told
the
maid
concerning
the
island
and
she
to
be
in
great
delight
and
interest
because
that
it
did
be
one
of
those
halts
of
mine
outward
going
and
did
be
all
eager
as
a
child
when
that
i
said
we
should
truly
have
need
of
a
raft
to
come
to
the
island
and
we
came
downward
to
the
shore
of
the
river
and
indeed
there
did
be
those
two
same
trees
that
had
been
my
raft
there
upon
the
shore
of
that
place
and
i
showed
these
to
mine
own
and
truly
she
did
nigh
to
weep
upon
them
because
of
her
dear
emotions
and
love
and
did
cut
a
small
branch
therefrom
with
her
beltknife
and
put
the
branch
where
she
did
put
the
piece
of
bark
and
this
to
be
for
a
remembrance
and
an
afterdelight
and
pondering
now
we
lookt
well
in
all
parts
that
we
find
some
other
small
tree
that
should
be
fallen
and
the
maid
did
climb
a
rock
that
did
be
near
with
a
flat
top
so
that
she
might
search
out
around
and
presently
she
cried
out
to
me
that
there
did
be
a
tree
to
our
purpose
and
but
an
hundred
paces
away
and
she
to
go
with
me
to
show
me
and
to
aid
if
need
be
but
indeed
i
carried
the
tree
very
easy
and
had
it
with
the
others
and
afterward
we
went
about
again
for
branches
and
these
i
cut
from
live
trees
using
the
diskos
with
care
and
wiseness
and
with
these
branches
to
be
for
crosspieces
and
our
belts
and
the
straps
for
binders
i
set
the
trees
together
into
a
raft
and
made
it
pretty
good
for
our
need
and
so
that
no
monstrous
thing
in
the
river
should
have
chance
to
snap
upward
between
the
trees
at
my
dear
one
and
when
the
raft
was
done
i
gat
it
to
the
water
and
the
maid
did
lend
her
strength
for
the
thing
was
heavy
as
you
shall
think
and
when
this
was
done
i
pushed
a
sharp
branch
downward
into
the
shore
and
i
hookt
a
branch
of
the
raft
about
this
mooring
and
so
did
be
nigh
ready
for
the
voyage
but
first
i
did
need
a
pole
to
push
the
raft
and
did
wonder
now
where
the
other
did
be
gone
that
i
cut
upon
the
outward
way
for
i
had
set
the
pole
with
the
two
trees
as
i
did
mind
having
some
vague
thought
that
mayhap
i
should
live
to
come
that
way
again
and
i
had
a
little
strange
unease
that
the
pole
did
be
gone
but
scarce
to
know
that
i
did
be
troubled
yet
to
set
me
to
a
new
haste
and
i
bid
the
maid
put
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
and
her
bundle
secure
upon
the
raft
and
in
that
time
i
lookt
well
about
for
a
sapling
tree
that
should
do
my
purpose
and
i
saw
that
there
grew
an
odd
one
a
little
to
the
side
of
the
flattopt
rock
that
the
maid
had
lookt
from
and
whilst
that
i
cut
it
the
maid
did
come
to
watch
and
made
pretty
chatter
in
the
time
that
i
trimmed
the
branches
away
and
lo
whilst
that
i
did
be
part
divided
in
mine
attention
between
her
dear
talk
and
my
work
and
an
haste
that
did
be
born
of
that
little
unease
that
was
come
upon
me
my
spirit
to
seem
to
be
aware
that
there
came
a
danger
anigh
to
us
and
the
maid
to
have
this
same
knowing
for
she
ceased
her
speech
and
lookt
at
me
with
somewhat
of
trouble
and
lo
in
that
moment
as
i
balanced
the
pole
in
my
hands
there
came
the
noise
of
a
sudden
bounding
to
our
backward
part
where
the
trees
did
grow
something
anigh
and
i
turned
instant
and
lookt
and
behold
there
did
be
upon
us
an
humpt
man
very
lumpish
and
mighty
and
he
stretched
out
his
hands
and
ran
at
me
and
i
had
no
time
to
the
diskos
which
did
be
upon
the
earth
to
my
feet
and
i
smote
the
humpt
man
with
the
point
of
the
pole
that
did
be
in
my
hands
and
the
point
took
him
very
strong
and
horrid
in
the
breast
and
entered
in
so
that
the
humpt
man
gave
out
a
strange
howling
that
did
be
half
seeming
of
an
animal
and
half
of
an
human
and
he
clutched
at
the
pole
that
did
so
hurt
him
and
i
stoopt
very
swift
for
the
diskos
and
had
it
in
a
moment
and
the
humpt
man
tore
the
pole
out
of
his
breast
and
in
the
same
instant
i
ript
him
from
the
head
downward
so
that
he
did
be
nigh
in
two
halves
for
i
had
no
mercy
in
mine
act
even
though
my
heart
did
be
something
sorry
now
even
as
the
man
died
there
did
be
a
sound
of
running
in
the
wood
before
me
and
lo
i
turned
very
speedy
to
the
maid
and
she
was
there
to
my
back
and
had
her
beltknife
drawn
in
her
hand
for
she
had
it
in
her
bosom
where
she
had
put
it
when
that
i
took
her
belt
for
the
raft
and
i
caught
the
maid
about
the
waist
with
my
left
arm
and
was
come
with
her
to
the
top
of
the
rock
in
two
great
houndings
and
i
set
her
there
upon
the
rock
and
turned
again
to
the
way
i
came
and
swung
the
diskos
free
for
indeed
i
had
seen
that
there
did
come
a
number
of
the
humpt
men
among
the
trees
and
there
came
running
from
the
wood
mayhaps
a
great
score
of
the
humpt
men
so
that
it
did
seem
to
me
that
we
did
be
going
to
die
for
how
should
one
stand
against
so
many
and
they
so
quick
and
strong
as
you
shall
mind
yet
in
verity
i
had
no
despair
but
did
be
mixt
in
the
heart
with
a
great
fear
for
mine
own
and
a
strange
and
exulting
gladness
that
i
should
do
that
day
some
deed
for
mine
own
maid
and
truly
this
to
be
the
pomp
of
love
and
the
heartcry
of
the
barbarian
as
you
shall
say
and
this
maybe
but
truly
i
did
be
proper
human
and
to
make
no
excuse
because
that
i
was
natural
neither
have
i
hid
anywheres
aught
that
i
did
think
and
feel
and
whether
that
you
approve
or
not
if
that
you
condemn
me
you
to
condemn
all
humanity
and
to
have
vain
words
and
vain
regrettings
for
these
things
that
be
named
for
faults
do
but
be
the
complement
of
our
virtues
and
if
that
you
slay
the
first
you
may
chance
to
wither
the
last
for
now
i
speak
of
things
as
they
be
now
and
as
they
did
be
then
and
nowise
of
lovely
ideals
that
do
live
chief
in
the
mind
and
so
much
in
mine
as
any
as
you
to
know
if
that
you
have
gone
with
me
all
along
my
way
and
surely
i
must
cease
from
my
thinkings
and
go
forward
with
my
telling
for
the
humpt
men
did
come
forward
at
a
wondrous
quick
run
and
did
swarm
upward
on
to
the
rock
as
that
they
did
be
panthers
and
they
made
no
outcry
but
came
silent
to
the
killing
and
i
saw
that
they
did
be
something
smaller
than
he
that
i
had
but
then
slain
and
in
verity
i
did
be
all
knit
in
that
moment
with
speed
and
cleverness
for
i
split
the
heads
of
three
with
but
quick
turns
of
my
wrist
as
i
did
wield
the
diskos
and
i
kicked
the
face
of
another
in
the
same
time
with
my
metal
boot
so
that
he
died
for
there
did
be
all
my
strength
and
all
my
skill
working
then
for
our
salvation
now
all
this
to
have
been
done
in
but
a
few
beats
of
the
heart
as
i
might
say
and
these
men
to
have
been
in
the
front
of
the
attacking
yet
there
did
be
no
space
to
have
breath
for
there
leaped
three
more
of
the
men
upon
the
rock
and
one
smote
me
with
a
great
piece
of
rock
that
he
carried
so
that
mine
armour
did
seem
as
that
it
crackt
and
i
to
be
driven
backward
upon
the
maid
yet
had
slain
one
of
the
humpt
men
even
in
that
moment
and
surely
my
dear
one
caught
me
in
her
arms
behind
and
steadied
me
so
that
i
fell
not
and
i
slew
the
humpt
man
with
the
rock
even
in
that
moment
whilst
mine
own
held
me
as
he
came
again
to
strike
me
and
i
then
to
be
firm
again
upon
my
feet
and
did
spring
at
the
third
of
the
humpt
men
and
surely
there
was
no
room
that
he
should
be
able
to
avoid
me
even
did
that
be
his
intent
and
he
came
at
me
with
a
great
leap
and
i
stood
strong
looking
clearly
to
my
work
and
i
swung
the
diskos
with
both
my
hands
and
the
blow
took
the
humpt
man
in
the
middle
part
and
split
him
whilst
that
he
did
be
yet
leaping
and
in
that
instant
there
reached
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
two
of
the
humpt
men
and
gat
me
by
the
feet
so
that
i
was
pulled
sudden
to
my
back
very
hard
and
bitter
and
this
to
be
done
even
whilst
that
the
body
of
the
humpt
man
did
be
yet
in
the
air
and
the
body
came
forward
over
me
and
did
be
utter
dead
already
and
fell
down
upon
the
rock
beyond
me
and
rolled
horridly
and
went
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
i
did
be
all
shaken
and
something
bemused
by
the
hardness
of
my
fall
and
the
hands
of
the
two
humpt
men
pluckt
me
sharp
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
the
while
that
i
did
strike
vaguely
to
wound
them
but
did
only
chip
the
rock
and
fortunate
that
i
harmed
not
the
weapon
and
lo
in
the
moment
that
they
had
been
like
to
have
me
downward
to
the
earth
into
their
midst
i
to
make
a
good
stroke
for
i
cut
the
shoulder
of
one
very
dreadful
so
that
he
loosed
me
and
immediately
i
kicked
very
fierce
with
my
freed
foot
and
surely
i
nigh
crushed
the
hand
of
that
other
with
my
metal
boot
and
he
likewise
to
cease
from
dragging
upon
me
and
immediately
i
knew
that
mine
own
did
be
helping
me
that
i
get
instant
to
my
feet
again
for
i
was
yet
something
dazed
and
there
came
then
a
rush
of
the
humpt
men
up
the
rock
and
truly
it
did
be
a
glad
thing
for
our
lives
that
they
might
come
up
only
upon
but
one
side
for
the
other
sides
did
be
utter
steep
and
smooth
worn
and
this
to
have
been
unto
our
saving
as
you
shall
think
and
i
stood
up
to
the
rush
of
the
humpt
men
and
did
smite
hard
at
them
with
a
quick
circling
of
the
diskos
so
that
the
great
weapon
did
glow
and
roar
and
they
gave
back
from
the
blaze
and
the
sound
of
the
diskos
and
surely
then
i
ran
in
upon
them
whilst
that
they
did
be
something
bewildered
and
i
gat
the
foremost
man
full
upon
the
head
so
that
he
did
be
dead
before
he
did
know
what
thing
happened
yet
in
verity
this
did
be
a
dread
moment
to
me
for
the
humpt
men
leaped
in
at
me
upon
every
side
in
an
instant
of
time
and
i
did
be
struck
upon
my
headpiece
and
upon
my
back
and
breast
with
the
stones
that
certain
of
them
did
carry
so
that
i
rockt
as
i
stood
and
did
near
to
swoon
and
mine
armour
to
be
all
dint
and
bent
upon
me
and
i
truly
to
seem
that
i
had
come
to
the
time
of
my
dying
and
lo
in
that
moment
of
time
there
did
come
to
my
dazed
sense
a
low
and
bitter
cry
of
anguish
from
the
maid
and
this
to
set
all
my
life
aglow
in
me
and
in
verity
there
went
a
strange
greyness
of
fury
before
mine
eyes
and
i
then
to
fight
as
i
did
never
fight
before
and
i
did
smite
as
it
did
seem
forever
and
the
greyness
did
ease
from
mine
eyes
and
the
maid
did
have
her
arms
about
me
as
i
stood
and
the
dead
men
to
lie
heapt
upon
the
rock
and
mine
own
to
steady
me
for
i
did
be
near
slain
and
the
blood
did
go
from
me
and
mine
armour
was
all
broke
upon
me
by
the
smitings
of
the
sharp
stones
and
i
lookt
something
slowly
upon
mine
own
and
she
to
know
that
i
would
ask
whether
that
she
did
be
harmed
anywise
and
she
to
be
very
brave
with
me
and
to
tell
me
that
she
did
be
well
and
she
to
be
all
slain
in
the
heart
because
that
i
did
be
so
hurt
but
truly
i
had
fought
a
good
fight
and
did
lack
only
to
know
that
she
come
to
no
harm
now
my
wits
did
come
back
into
me
very
soon
but
i
did
be
utter
weak
and
scarce
to
stand
so
that
i
did
mind
only
that
i
get
mine
own
safe
unto
the
raft
and
to
put
off
then
from
the
shore
and
i
walkt
slow
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
lookt
well
about
that
i
learn
whether
the
humpt
men
did
be
all
gone
away
and
the
maid
did
steady
me
and
lo
there
came
up
in
that
instant
the
last
of
the
humpt
men
and
they
were
five
and
did
creep
very
stealthy
that
they
have
me
in
surprise
and
i
loost
from
the
maid
for
i
saw
that
i
must
come
upon
them
whilst
that
i
had
any
strength
left
in
my
body
and
they
now
to
leap
upward
unto
me
so
that
i
gat
the
first
upon
the
head
and
he
to
go
backward
dead
but
truly
i
did
be
more
weak
than
i
knew
for
i
swayed
upon
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
sudden
i
went
downward
to
the
earth
and
did
be
there
upon
my
knees
and
my
back
to
the
rock
and
in
verity
the
humpt
men
did
come
in
upon
me
very
swift
yet
did
they
give
back
from
the
diskos
which
i
swung
to
and
fro
so
speedy
as
i
might
for
my
weakness
which
did
be
so
utter
that
i
could
nowise
come
to
my
feet
to
stand
and
mine
own
came
down
swiftly
from
the
rock
and
ran
past
the
humpt
men
and
i
to
make
that
i
shout
to
her
to
go
to
the
raft
but
truly
i
had
no
voice
in
my
body
and
did
be
dumb
and
weak
and
did
know
that
i
should
be
gone
forever
from
mine
own
in
a
little
moment
and
she
to
have
none
to
protect
her
neither
to
know
the
way
of
our
journey
save
by
reason
and
behold
mine
own
did
shout
to
the
humpt
men
and
i
perceived
that
she
made
to
draw
them
after
her
for
she
ran
to
and
fore
and
did
shout
continually
but
indeed
the
humpt
men
had
no
heed
of
her
but
did
make
alway
to
come
at
me
and
surely
in
that
moment
one
of
the
humpt
men
reached
me
and
smote
me
so
shrewd
that
sure
he
nigh
crackt
his
monstrous
hand
upon
mine
armour
and
did
drive
me
backward
upon
the
rock
and
to
make
me
bleed
afresh
so
that
i
was
all
in
a
daze
and
near
swooned
away
and
the
humpt
man
caught
at
the
diskos
yet
in
verity
he
loost
it
on
the
instant
for
it
did
burn
and
shake
him
very
sore
and
immediately
he
smote
me
again
and
so
made
to
end
me
and
lo
in
that
moment
the
maid
ran
right
in
among
the
humpt
men
and
she
struck
the
man
that
strove
with
me
and
drove
her
beltknife
once
and
again
through
his
arm
very
savage
and
determined
and
surely
the
man
turned
upon
her
and
he
caught
her
by
her
garments
and
he
ript
her
two
garments
utter
from
her
so
that
they
came
away
and
she
did
be
free
and
behold
mine
utter
despair
for
her
did
give
me
a
new
strength
so
that
i
shouted
to
her
that
she
run
instant
to
the
raft
and
i
cut
the
humpt
man
in
twain
and
did
fall
back
then
into
a
part
swoon
against
the
rock
and
lo
the
maid
ran
out
from
the
humpt
men
but
they
neither
to
know
whether
that
they
follow
her
or
that
they
come
in
upon
me
and
as
they
did
pause
she
to
call
to
them
and
to
try
that
she
tempt
them
from
me
toward
the
wood
for
she
had
no
thought
of
her
life
but
only
that
she
free
me
and
save
me
and
i
too
weak
even
to
have
power
to
command
her
to
the
raft
and
she
truly
to
have
no
heed
to
such
command
even
did
i
thus
to
call
again
and
there
i
did
be
halfgone
out
from
this
life
and
lookt
at
her
with
eyes
that
did
scarce
wot
save
as
in
a
dream
and
lo
the
humpt
men
ceased
sudden
that
they
heed
her
and
the
three
that
did
be
left
came
very
sly
unto
me
and
with
slowness
and
cunning
for
they
wotted
not
whether
i
did
be
dead
or
but
await
for
them
and
the
maid
perceived
that
they
came
not
after
her
and
she
let
out
a
great
cry
that
did
be
distantseeming
in
my
dulled
ears
and
came
back
naked
and
running
very
swift
and
she
ran
by
me
as
death
should
run
white
and
silent
and
her
face
set
unto
despair
and
her
eyes
utter
intent
and
she
struck
her
beltknife
into
the
shoulder
of
the
near
humpt
man
and
the
man
howled
and
turned
and
she
did
leap
to
the
side
and
the
humpt
man
ran
at
her
but
lo
she
leaped
again
this
way
and
that
and
utter
silent
and
so
quick
as
a
light
doth
seem
to
dance
all
ways
in
a
moment
and
the
two
other
men
did
join
with
the
first
that
they
catch
her
and
behold
she
went
about
and
did
run
right
away
among
the
trees
and
the
three
men
did
come
after
her
running
very
lumbersome
yet
with
a
great
speed
and
the
maid
had
the
knife
in
her
hand
and
i
knew
that
she
did
mean
to
slay
herself
presently
when
that
she
could
run
no
more
and
in
that
moment
it
seemed
that
my
heart
burst
for
that
i
should
never
more
see
mine
own
maid
forever
and
there
came
some
power
of
movement
into
me
and
i
came
forward
from
the
rock
and
fell
over
upon
my
face
and
i
gat
again
to
my
knees
and
began
that
i
creep
after
the
maid
and
i
did
shout
in
whispers
for
my
voice
had
no
more
power
to
call
and
the
maid
went
from
my
sight
among
the
trees
as
a
far
white
figure
that
did
run
very
swift
and
was
presently
lost
utter
to
my
sight
and
the
humpt
men
did
go
after
yet
even
in
my
weakness
i
perceived
that
two
did
go
something
clumsy
as
that
they
had
been
hurt
in
the
fight
and
they
to
be
the
rearward
of
the
chasing
but
he
that
the
maid
did
cut
with
the
knife
was
to
the
fore
and
did
run
very
strong
and
surely
they
were
all
gone
inward
of
the
trees
with
a
dreadful
speed
and
were
lost
from
me
and
the
world
did
become
sudden
an
emptyness
and
a
great
horror
and
there
was
no
sound
in
all
the
earth
as
it
did
seem
and
i
knew
that
i
was
come
to
my
feet
and
did
run
toward
the
trees
and
the
diskos
did
trail
from
mine
arm
by
the
holdbuckle
and
the
ground
did
be
as
that
it
moved
and
shifted
under
me
and
i
not
to
feel
where
i
trod
but
did
only
peer
desperate
and
lost
among
the
trees
and
as
i
to
know
now
i
heard
my
voice
calling
strangely
and
afterward
there
was
a
thundering
in
mine
ears
and
i
came
downward
upon
my
face
and
i
did
know
presently
that
i
was
alive
and
there
to
be
some
dreadful
terror
at
my
heart
and
surely
i
did
remember
and
sickened
and
gat
my
head
from
the
ground
and
i
lookt
among
the
trees
but
there
did
be
nothing
and
everywhere
there
did
be
a
strange
silence
and
a
dimness
of
unreal
seemings
and
i
knew
that
mine
own
was
gone
from
me
and
had
surely
died
and
the
earth
did
be
all
stained
about
me
with
my
blood
and
i
did
be
utter
glad
for
i
to
need
death
and
i
swooned
again
and
was
lost
to
my
pain
but
did
live
presently
to
know
and
there
was
a
little
strength
come
into
me
and
i
gat
my
head
up
somewhat
from
the
ground
and
did
peer
among
the
trees
and
my
head
did
be
too
heavy
and
my
face
came
against
the
earth
once
more
and
because
that
i
could
not
hold
up
my
head
i
rolled
my
head
a
little
until
that
my
cheek
did
be
to
the
ground
and
i
to
look
thiswise
so
well
as
i
might
but
there
did
be
nothing
and
afterward
i
rolled
my
head
again
to
the
other
cheek
and
so
to
stare
very
weak
and
desperate
and
not
abled
to
look
proper
to
my
front
and
lo
there
went
something
among
the
trees
and
did
show
white
in
the
gloom
of
the
wood
and
did
come
through
the
trees
and
i
not
to
believe
in
the
first
that
i
did
truly
see
aught
and
sudden
i
to
know
that
i
saw
somewhat
and
behold
my
heart
did
bound
in
me
so
that
all
my
body
did
waken
for
i
knew
that
mine
own
maid
did
run
slow
and
staggering
toward
me
through
the
wood
and
i
did
be
now
upon
my
knees
and
upon
my
hands
and
did
begin
again
to
creep
and
to
bleed
and
did
make
little
callings
to
mine
own
that
had
no
sounding
and
mine
own
drew
nigh
and
did
rock
and
stagger
and
did
strike
anon
against
the
trunks
of
the
trees
as
that
she
did
be
gone
near
blind
with
her
running
and
in
a
moment
she
saw
me
and
that
i
did
yet
live
and
did
come
unto
her
and
she
made
a
strange
and
loving
crying
unto
me
with
a
great
gladness
and
with
an
utter
weakness
and
she
came
running
and
was
lost
with
faintness
and
did
sway
this
way
and
that
stumbling
and
she
went
sudden
to
the
earth
and
did
be
still
and
i
crept
onward
so
speedy
as
i
might
and
the
earth
to
seem
alway
as
that
it
moved
from
my
hands
and
to
slide
and
thisseeming
to
be
of
my
weakness
for
my
hands
and
my
knees
went
everyway
and
my
head
to
be
that
it
kept
nodding
forward
very
stupid
to
the
earth
and
lo
as
i
came
anigh
unto
the
maid
where
she
did
lie
so
quiet
i
saw
that
something
moved
in
the
wood
and
was
running
and
truly
it
did
be
an
humpt
man
and
came
forward
very
silent
and
with
a
quick
slyness
as
that
he
did
track
the
maid
secretly
for
he
lookt
alway
to
the
earth
and
i
perceived
that
he
was
that
one
of
the
humpt
men
which
the
maid
had
cut
with
the
knife
for
the
blood
did
show
upon
the
shoulder
and
the
breast
and
this
bleeding
mayhap
to
have
slowed
the
man
so
that
mine
own
did
be
like
to
have
supposed
she
had
come
utter
free
yet
he
to
have
found
her
by
tracking
as
i
perceived
and
i
strave
to
my
feet
that
i
should
come
to
the
maid
before
the
humpt
man
and
surely
i
gat
upright
and
went
with
a
strange
running
and
did
roll
and
lo
i
fell
immediate
ere
i
was
come
to
her
and
the
humpt
man
to
run
also
and
surely
it
did
be
a
dreadful
race
for
i
went
creeping
and
did
be
weak
and
as
that
i
was
of
lead
and
the
humpt
man
came
very
swift
and
brutish
but
i
came
the
first
to
mine
own
maid
and
i
rose
up
at
the
humpt
man
upon
my
knees
and
i
swung
the
diskos
and
the
great
weapon
did
roar
in
my
hands
as
that
it
did
know
and
did
live
and
the
humpt
man
ran
in
upon
me
but
i
smote
him
truly
with
the
diskos
and
he
ran
past
me
all
blundering
and
fell
and
died
upon
his
face
a
little
way
off
and
lo
my
wounds
had
brake
out
into
a
great
bleeding
and
my
head
did
roll
upon
my
shoulders
and
i
lookt
down
dull
yet
with
an
utter
great
love
upon
mine
own
and
there
did
be
no
proper
wound
upon
her
but
yet
was
she
all
bruised
and
knockt
and
marked
with
the
trees
and
where
she
did
fall
in
her
running
and
she
did
be
there
very
still
and
dear
and
i
to
have
brake
my
heart
with
love
for
her
but
that
i
did
be
so
dulled
as
i
have
told
and
i
fought
that
i
should
be
strong
a
little
while
more
against
my
weakness
and
i
strove
that
i
set
mine
ear
gently
upon
her
breast
that
i
should
listen
for
her
heart
but
my
head
did
go
downward
something
clumsy
and
heavy
upon
her
and
i
then
to
hearken
and
surely
she
did
live
and
her
heart
did
beat
though
in
verity
mine
ears
did
have
at
first
a
thundering
but
afterward
a
quietness
in
them
that
made
the
sounding
of
her
pulsing
to
seem
an
utter
long
way
off
and
very
faint
it
did
be
and
surely
in
that
moment
even
as
i
harked
i
was
gone
over
into
a
deadness
and
had
no
more
knowing
neither
to
have
even
a
knowledge
that
i
did
be
slipt
from
my
senses
and
behold
the
maid
did
lie
swooning
and
i
to
be
there
in
my
broken
armour
and
my
head
upon
the
breast
of
mine
own
and
likewise
to
know
naught
and
about
us
the
quietness
of
that
country
and
the
far
noise
of
the
great
firehills
that
did
sound
through
eternity
xiv
on
the
island
now
i
came
unto
my
senses
and
did
be
in
pain
and
a
great
forgetfulness
and
bewilderment
and
i
strove
that
i
rise
but
did
be
held
by
a
strange
force
that
did
be
surely
my
weakness
as
i
to
know
afterward
and
i
was
upon
my
back
and
a
little
sound
did
be
near
me
as
that
something
did
pant
and
i
turned
my
head
very
slow
because
that
i
did
so
lack
of
strength
and
lo
i
saw
that
the
maid
did
be
anigh
to
me
and
did
be
yet
naked
and
did
pant
and
pusht
hard
and
desperate
with
a
great
pole
which
did
be
surely
that
one
which
i
had
cut
when
that
the
humpt
men
came
upon
us
and
therewith
i
remembered
all
and
perceived
that
i
did
be
upon
the
raft
and
the
maid
to
push
the
raft
along
with
the
pole
and
at
that
i
made
a
little
sound
with
my
mouth
but
the
maid
not
to
hear
me
for
she
did
look
backward
as
i
should
think
to
the
shore
and
her
face
did
be
very
set
and
anxious
and
there
to
be
a
far
noise
of
howling
that
i
knew
to
be
the
voices
of
the
humpt
men
and
so
to
perceive
that
the
maid
had
come
unto
her
senses
and
had
gat
me
somewise
to
the
raft
whilst
that
i
did
yet
be
swoond
and
thus
to
save
me
ere
the
humpt
men
had
come
but
in
verity
how
she
did
this
thing
i
never
to
learn
neither
she
to
know
but
only
that
her
love
did
give
her
a
great
and
desperate
strength
that
she
save
me
that
did
be
her
man
and
afterward
mine
own
maid
did
tell
me
how
that
she
had
come
into
her
senses
and
did
be
there
upon
the
earth
and
somewhat
did
be
upon
her
breast
and
she
saw
that
it
was
my
head
which
did
be
heavy
upon
her
and
i
to
be
surely
gone
out
from
this
life
for
i
was
so
still
and
she
came
from
under
me
and
did
ease
me
out
upon
the
earth
and
her
heart
nigh
brake
because
that
i
was
so
bebled
and
my
blood
to
have
stained
all
that
did
be
near
but
when
she
had
gat
me
restful
she
saw
that
i
did
surely
live
and
a
great
hope
to
spring
in
her
heart
and
oft
as
she
had
eased
me
she
had
lookt
about
and
there
did
be
naught
to
the
sight
save
the
body
of
the
humpt
man
anigh
and
the
others
dead
about
and
upon
the
flattopped
rock
as
you
to
mind
and
she
ran
then
very
speedy
to
the
raft
and
brought
water
from
the
river
in
my
headpiece
and
she
dasht
the
water
upon
me
but
i
to
have
no
power
to
come
unto
my
senses
and
lo
in
that
moment
she
to
know
by
some
subtile
telling
of
the
spirit
that
there
came
some
danger
anigh
and
she
then
to
make
that
she
save
me
or
that
we
die
both
of
us
together
and
she
strave
with
me
and
did
carry
and
draw
me
that
weariful
way
unto
the
raft
and
she
gat
me
on
to
the
raft
and
she
ran
then
for
the
pole
that
did
be
beside
the
rock
and
whilst
that
she
took
the
pole
she
perceived
her
torn
garments
that
did
be
yet
in
the
hands
of
the
humpt
man
even
as
she
had
slipt
them
to
escape
him
and
she
caught
the
garments
very
hasty
from
the
hand
of
the
man
and
ran
then
to
the
raft
and
she
pusht
the
raft
out
from
the
shore
and
leaped
aboard
and
behold
as
she
made
to
use
the
pole
there
came
a
sound
out
of
the
wood
and
there
ran
from
the
wood
the
two
humpt
men
that
did
yet
live
and
they
to
have
trackt
her
after
that
she
did
run
from
them
and
they
ran
downward
to
the
shore
very
silent
and
intent
upon
her
but
she
to
work
with
an
utter
despair
and
to
have
the
raft
a
good
way
out
ere
they
did
be
come
and
surely
they
either
to
have
no
power
of
swimming
or
to
know
that
there
did
be
a
dread
in
the
water
for
they
made
not
to
come
after
but
did
stand
and
stare
very
stupid
and
afterward
to
howl
and
this
howling
i
did
hear
when
that
i
was
come
unto
myself
upon
the
raft
as
you
do
know
and
by
this
telling
you
to
be
so
wise
as
i
for
more
i
know
not
save
odd
things
that
i
did
learn
afterward
that
did
but
set
my
love
more
holy
unto
mine
own
maid
and
these
to
have
been
but
small
matters
of
lovethoughts
that
we
did
have
together
and
scarce
clear
unto
my
remembering
and
lo
even
as
i
harked
unto
the
howling
of
the
humpt
men
the
sound
did
grow
more
faint
and
far
off
for
the
maid
worked
very
desperate
with
the
pole
and
i
did
feel
that
i
would
help
her
but
yet
was
so
alack
and
surely
even
as
i
did
mean
to
rise
i
was
gone
again
utter
from
my
senses
and
that
dear
naked
one
did
pilot
me
safe
and
loving
unto
the
safe
harbouring
of
the
little
island
that
you
do
mind
and
had
no
thought
unto
herself
but
only
that
she
save
me
and
i
to
be
there
scarce
offward
from
my
death
and
to
have
no
knowing
of
aught
and
no
more
power
to
help
or
to
be
a
shield
unto
mine
own
but
did
be
only
an
helpless
man
that
had
surely
died
save
for
the
care
of
my
beloved
yet
did
i
fight
a
good
fight
and
have
alway
a
great
joy
in
the
remembering
now
i
mind
nothing
very
clear
after
this
for
a
great
time
but
only
of
pain
and
weariness
and
of
half
wakings
and
times
when
i
did
know
naught
and
others
when
that
i
did
be
awake
yet
did
have
no
realness
either
in
myself
or
in
any
land
or
place
and
all
to
come
back
strange
and
vague
yet
with
a
constant
knowing
that
there
went
love
about
me
and
a
great
and
gentle
watchfulness
so
that
i
was
eased
when
that
the
black
mists
of
my
weakness
did
uprise
about
me
to
swamp
me
and
i
was
made
to
know
hope
when
that
unknown
despairs
did
live
stealthy
within
me
and
lo
there
came
a
time
when
i
waked
and
did
be
freed
of
uncertain
burdenings
and
peculiar
woes
and
that
still
haze
through
which
great
achings
did
come
constant
upon
me
and
surely
i
was
laid
very
nice
upon
somewhat
that
did
be
soft
and
there
went
a
sweet
quietness
about
me
and
an
healthful
drowse
did
grow
in
my
bones
and
slowly
i
perceived
that
the
maid
did
kneel
beside
me
and
did
look
upon
me
with
so
great
a
love
and
gladness
that
it
did
be
as
that
i
drank
in
health
and
a
drowsy
joy
and
peace
and
surely
she
stoopt
and
kiss
me
with
an
utter
gentle
love
upon
my
mouth
and
her
tears
to
go
sweet
upon
my
face
and
truly
i
kist
her
again
with
an
utter
content
and
she
took
my
head
in
the
comfort
of
her
arm
and
gave
me
somewhat
that
i
drink
and
when
i
had
drunk
she
kiss
me
once
again
so
light
as
that
a
pretty
wind
did
blow
hushed
upon
my
lips
and
my
head
she
made
easy
and
lo
i
was
gone
over
unto
sleep
even
as
she
tended
me
and
thrice
do
i
mind
that
this
to
happen
and
at
the
third
time
i
knew
that
my
strength
was
come
something
into
me
again
and
i
moved
my
hand
a
little
this
way
and
that
and
she
to
know
that
i
did
need
her
to
hold
my
hand
and
she
to
do
this
and
i
to
go
into
sleep
again
even
while
that
i
look
sleepy
yet
with
all
my
love
into
her
eyes
and
when
i
waked
for
the
fourth
time
i
did
whisper
that
i
loved
her
and
surely
she
broke
into
a
sudden
weeping
and
did
hold
my
hand
very
dear
against
her
breast
and
when
i
waked
for
the
fifth
time
i
to
know
how
things
did
be
about
me
and
that
i
did
lie
naked
in
the
cloak
and
did
be
all
bandaged
about
my
body
and
the
bandages
as
i
did
know
afterward
did
be
from
the
torn
garments
of
the
maid
and
i
look
at
the
maid
and
knew
that
she
did
be
drest
again
and
did
be
in
the
garments
that
i
did
give
to
her
as
you
to
mind
which
did
be
that
one
and
the
inner
that
the
humpt
man
tore
from
her
and
which
she
had
slipt
that
she
escape
from
the
man
and
afterward
i
found
that
she
had
made
a
very
cunning
mend
of
the
garments
whilst
that
she
did
sit
so
utter
long
beside
me
to
tend
me
for
she
had
gotten
threads
from
her
torn
garments
and
had
made
needles
from
thorns
that
did
grow
on
the
little
bushes
of
the
island
and
the
thorns
did
brake
oft
and
she
then
to
have
another
and
so
to
persist
an
hundred
times
and
this
way
she
did
be
drest
very
nice
and
dainty
and
mine
own
maid
perceived
how
that
i
lookt
with
interest
at
her
and
did
mind
very
natural
how
that
i
last
to
have
seen
her
and
she
then
to
blush
gently
and
did
kiss
me
that
she
have
her
pretty
face
something
from
mine
eyes
and
truly
i
to
wish
the
more
that
i
be
strong
that
i
kneel
in
a
glad
reverence
unto
her
for
this
way
did
be
my
love
and
ever
so
and
you
likewise
that
have
truly
loved
now
i
did
begin
that
i
grew
very
steady
unto
my
strength
again
and
mine
own
maid
did
tend
me
alway
and
she
gave
me
a
broth
of
tablets
and
the
water
at
set
times
by
the
telling
of
my
timepiece
and
oft
she
washt
me
and
did
change
the
bandages
and
did
wash
and
dry
the
bandages
that
she
use
them
over
again
for
we
did
be
so
lacking
for
such
matters
as
you
to
know
and
on
the
fifth
day
i
was
come
utter
to
ease
and
did
be
wondrous
happy
and
mine
own
to
make
pretty
talk
unto
me
but
had
me
to
be
alway
quiet
because
that
i
did
be
yet
so
weak
and
on
the
sixth
day
i
to
be
let
answer
mine
own
and
to
say
how
great
i
did
love
her
the
which
mine
eyes
had
said
alway
while
that
i
did
lie
in
silence
and
i
to
be
assured
by
the
maid
that
she
did
be
in
health
and
recovered
but
indeed
i
saw
that
she
was
gone
very
thin
and
that
her
eyes
did
be
weary
even
while
that
they
had
so
great
a
love
and
a
gladness
to
me
and
i
made
mine
own
to
bring
her
tablets
by
me
as
she
did
alway
and
when
that
i
had
kist
them
and
she
to
have
eat
and
drunk
i
bade
her
to
make
me
the
broth
ready
and
when
she
had
made
the
broth
i
askt
that
the
diskos
be
set
anigh
to
me
and
afterward
i
bid
her
to
my
side
and
had
her
to
lie
by
me
and
i
took
her
pretty
head
upon
mine
arm
and
told
her
that
she
to
lie
thus
and
to
sleep
and
to
have
no
fear
that
she
weary
me
for
that
i
to
be
but
the
more
rested
to
have
her
so
beside
me
and
she
in
the
first
to
trouble
that
she
be
too
heavy
for
mine
arm
but
truly
i
showed
that
my
strength
was
something
come
back
to
me
for
i
prest
her
gentle
unto
me
and
she
then
to
nestle
content
and
to
be
gone
into
an
utter
sleep
and
to
have
been
in
a
sore
need
of
the
same
and
mine
own
did
sleep
for
twelve
great
hours
and
had
scarce
any
life
in
all
that
time
save
when
once
she
did
make
a
little
and
gentle
moaning
and
did
afterward
set
her
pretty
face
more
nigh
to
me
in
her
sleep
and
surely
i
had
neither
weariness
nor
lonesomeness
but
did
lie
with
an
utter
content
and
did
look
downward
upon
the
maid
where
she
did
sleep
in
the
hollow
of
mine
arm
and
truly
she
did
be
most
wondrous
lovely
and
dainty
and
the
goodness
of
her
face
did
seem
as
that
it
made
an
holiness
about
my
heart
so
that
my
spirit
was
uplift
in
a
quiet
and
constant
glory
of
love
and
i
drank
a
part
of
the
broth
at
the
third
hour
and
at
the
sixth
hour
and
at
the
ninth
hour
when
that
i
finished
it
and
my
right
arm
did
be
free
to
this
purpose
and
to
the
diskos
and
surely
i
did
twice
and
thrice
set
my
hand
upon
that
great
weapon
as
to
a
true
comrade
and
in
verity
i
could
think
the
weapon
did
know
and
did
love
me
and
this
thinking
to
be
because
i
did
be
so
uplift
as
i
have
told
yet
truly
the
diskos
did
be
a
strange
and
wondrous
thing
and
did
be
alway
thought
to
have
an
oneness
with
the
man
that
did
use
it
and
in
the
twelfth
hour
the
maid
awoke
sudden
and
came
upward
out
of
mine
arm
all
in
a
sweet
haste
that
she
know
that
i
did
be
well
and
she
did
be
eased
wondrous
when
that
she
saw
how
i
laughed
with
a
quiet
joy
but
to
see
her
dear
eyes
and
her
pretty
trouble
yet
did
she
be
in
reproach
to
herself
when
that
she
lookt
to
find
how
the
hours
had
past
but
indeed
i
did
make
a
mocking
sternness
with
her
and
forbad
that
she
even
to
say
one
little
word
more
upon
this
matter
but
to
be
glad
that
i
did
be
so
utter
happy
and
she
likewise
and
truly
when
i
had
said
this
that
impudent
maid
did
set
her
little
fist
against
my
nose
and
to
threaten
me
and
in
verity
i
laught
so
hearty
that
the
maid
did
be
in
fear
i
should
set
my
wounds
again
to
bleed
and
did
reproach
herself
again
but
in
truth
i
came
to
no
harm
and
when
that
i
could
speak
i
askt
the
maid
whether
that
there
had
been
brothers
to
her
because
that
she
did
play
so
natural
and
this
i
askt
not
thinking
and
lo
in
a
moment
i
perceived
my
thoughtlessness
but
said
naught
save
to
take
the
hand
of
mine
own
that
she
know
utter
that
i
did
not
be
heartless
and
she
to
nod
very
quiet
and
afterward
kist
my
hand
and
slipt
from
me
and
i
knew
that
she
was
gone
a
little
way
off
lest
she
weep
and
i
did
be
in
trouble
for
her
and
for
mine
alackness
but
truly
i
could
do
naught
only
that
i
called
very
gentle
unto
her
and
she
to
return
soon
and
did
smile
loving
and
cheerful
upon
me
but
indeed
i
saw
that
she
covered
her
weeping
whilst
that
she
had
made
me
new
broth
yet
before
i
would
take
the
broth
i
would
have
her
to
mine
arms
and
she
to
submit
very
glad
and
happy
but
to
keep
her
pretty
weight
from
me
lest
she
hurt
my
woundings
and
afterward
we
both
to
eat
and
be
happy
in
glad
talk
and
presently
i
did
sleep
but
would
have
her
to
be
nigh
to
me
even
though
she
did
be
wakeful
and
so
we
to
be
utter
content
together
now
the
seventh
day
as
it
might
be
called
was
a
wondrous
happy
time
and
when
i
waked
the
maid
did
be
sleeping
as
a
child
to
my
side
and
her
face
nestled
against
me
and
she
to
waken
in
a
moment
for
thus
had
she
drowsed
and
watched
through
all
the
hours
whilst
that
i
had
slept
and
we
then
to
eat
and
to
drink
together
after
that
mine
own
had
made
me
easy
with
a
gentle
washing
and
care
and
i
now
to
be
allowed
that
i
have
my
tablets
whole
and
the
water
afterward
as
when
that
i
did
be
well
and
this
to
please
me
as
you
shall
think
for
i
did
ache
that
i
be
strong
very
speedy
that
i
have
power
to
guard
mine
own
maid
again
and
to
go
forward
with
our
journeying
that
i
have
the
maid
unto
the
safeness
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
surely
now
that
i
had
my
tablets
whole
i
to
feel
that
i
did
grow
near
unto
fitness
again
and
moreover
they
did
satisfy
my
hunger
the
better
than
the
broth
and
the
maid
to
give
me
my
tablets
oft
so
that
i
eat
a
great
many
and
i
did
make
her
to
count
and
surely
there
did
be
sufficient
if
that
i
get
strong
pretty
quick
and
so
i
made
no
refusing
of
the
tablets
for
i
did
need
them
that
i
make
blood
again
within
me
else
should
i
be
lacking
when
that
there
came
any
need
anigh
and
we
kist
each
the
tablets
of
the
other
and
did
drink
from
the
same
cup
and
did
be
utter
happy
and
did
be
part
like
children
but
also
to
be
man
and
maid
and
presently
the
maid
did
shift
my
bandages
as
alway
and
washt
me
proper
and
had
me
into
comfort
but
she
did
keep
me
alway
very
lowlying
and
truly
i
scarce
to
mind
for
i
was
not
gotten
enough
of
my
strength
to
give
me
to
feel
irked
and
further
as
you
shall
think
there
did
be
that
lovely
one
with
me
alway
and
did
make
sweet
quips
unto
me
and
talkt
and
did
laugh
and
oft
did
come
into
singing
for
she
did
be
so
sweetly
joyed
that
i
was
in
life
and
did
mend
so
proper
and
afterward
she
went
off
from
me
a
little
to
her
toilet
but
i
to
ask
that
she
be
so
swift
as
might
be
and
she
to
promise
very
merry
and
she
came
back
in
a
little
while
and
her
hair
to
be
in
a
lovely
cloud
about
her
shoulders
and
her
pretty
feet
yet
to
be
bared
from
her
bath
which
she
had
in
a
pool
beyond
some
bushes
and
she
to
say
that
i
did
be
so
impatient
a
man
that
she
to
be
forced
that
she
do
the
half
of
her
dressing
with
me
but
truly
she
came
thiswise
only
because
she
to
know
how
i
did
delight
in
her
thus
and
to
watch
the
way
that
she
set
up
her
abundance
of
hair
and
she
to
be
hungry
also
that
she
be
with
me
and
to
love
me
that
i
watch
her
even
while
that
there
did
be
oft
a
little
and
quaint
stirring
of
shyness
in
her
dear
heart
and
i
had
her
to
come
beside
me
and
to
sit
anigh
to
my
hand
and
i
made
presently
that
i
did
scold
her
because
that
she
had
no
proper
care
to
her
pretty
feet
and
i
bid
her
to
set
her
feet
toward
me
that
i
look
the
more
close
at
them
and
she
to
be
a
pretty
rogue
and
did
think
i
to
mean
to
kiss
themand
truly
not
to
think
alway
wrongbut
i
then
to
have
another
planning
for
i
had
pluckt
a
hair
very
sly
from
her
head
and
she
but
to
have
said
an
oh
to
me
and
to
have
thought
no
more
but
indeed
when
that
she
gave
her
feet
to
me
i
held
them
so
strong
as
i
might
and
i
bound
her
pretty
toes
together
with
the
hair
and
surely
she
did
be
a
captive
unto
me
and
we
to
laugh
as
that
we
to
be
both
children
and
afterward
she
stole
back
her
feet
from
me
but
in
verity
i
knew
that
she
had
a
wondrous
heed
that
she
brake
not
the
hair
that
bound
her
but
did
sit
beside
me
bound
in
that
pretty
way
but
yet
to
hide
from
me
that
she
did
not
brake
the
hair
and
she
then
to
do
her
hair
upon
her
head
very
lovely
and
afterward
i
put
up
my
hands
and
took
it
down
again
and
she
then
to
kiss
me
and
to
ask
how
that
she
should
ever
have
it
proper
upon
her
head
if
that
i
did
alway
so
tease
her
and
she
then
to
take
her
hair
and
did
set
the
abundance
of
it
upon
both
sides
of
my
face
and
then
to
kiss
me
as
i
did
look
up
at
her
from
out
of
so
much
beauty
and
afterward
she
cut
a
lock
of
my
hair
and
a
lock
from
her
own
dear
head
and
she
did
plait
the
two
locks
together
so
that
our
hair
did
blend
and
be
together
and
afterward
she
hid
it
in
her
bosom
but
i
did
be
then
out
of
content
and
would
have
done
likewise
only
that
it
did
so
weary
me
to
uphold
my
hands
and
she
to
cut
a
second
lock
from
my
head
and
a
second
tress
of
her
own
most
lovely
hair
and
she
made
me
to
kiss
the
hair
that
did
be
from
her
and
she
then
to
kiss
the
hair
that
did
be
from
me
and
afterward
she
did
plait
them
together
and
gave
them
to
me
and
i
set
the
hair
for
that
time
under
the
great
bandage
that
went
over
my
heart
and
truly
she
did
be
then
the
one
that
lackt
content
for
she
to
say
that
the
second
plaiting
did
be
kist
and
the
first
to
lack
but
i
to
refuse
to
exchange
so
that
we
made
up
a
quarrelling
and
did
presently
have
to
be
kist
unto
forgiveness
and
truly
have
you
not
likewise
known
such
glad
foolishness
when
that
you
were
in
the
lovedays
and
she
then
to
make
me
to
be
quiet
and
to
keep
my
hands
downward
from
her
hair
because
that
the
uplifting
did
prove
overmuch
to
me
and
she
took
my
great
hands
then
and
did
threaten
how
dreadful
she
use
me
if
that
i
be
not
humble
and
truly
i
said
that
i
did
be
an
humble
man
and
she
then
to
hold
my
hands
with
but
one
small
one
and
surely
her
hand
did
be
so
small
that
she
not
able
to
hold
me
save
by
the
thumbs
and
she
then
with
her
free
hand
to
cover
mine
eyes
so
that
i
might
not
see
and
whilst
that
she
did
hold
me
thus
so
utter
helpless
she
to
kiss
me
very
dainty
and
impudent
upon
the
mouth
and
afterward
she
loost
me
and
did
be
demure
and
we
did
be
then
silent
a
space
and
presently
i
put
forth
my
hand
that
did
be
very
great
yet
to
be
gone
white
and
to
tremble
because
that
i
did
lack
so
utter
of
blood
and
the
maid
to
know
what
i
did
mean
and
she
clenched
her
hands
into
two
fists
and
set
them
both
into
my
one
hand
and
surely
they
did
be
little
fists
and
i
then
to
be
happy
for
this
did
be
a
wondrous
pleasure
alway
unto
me
and
she
to
have
her
lids
a
little
downward
upon
her
eyes
and
to
be
quietly
happy
and
truly
how
i
mind
it
all
so
plain
and
afterward
i
did
plague
her
very
gentle
that
she
to
be
all
alack
if
that
she
did
try
to
use
her
hands
to
aught
because
that
they
did
be
so
small
and
she
in
a
moment
to
have
her
two
arms
very
dear
about
my
neck
and
did
kiss
me
with
an
utter
love
and
tenderness
upon
the
mouth
and
afterward
went
from
me
lest
that
she
have
me
to
overset
myself
and
i
did
then
to
make
her
to
sit
by
me
and
i
did
tell
her
a
tale
how
that
a
young
man
did
once
live
in
the
olden
days
and
did
meet
with
the
one
maid
upon
all
the
earth
and
how
that
they
loved
and
did
be
married
and
she
to
die
and
of
the
utter
and
desperate
madness
of
grief
that
nigh
destroyed
the
man
and
how
that
he
sudden
to
wake
into
the
future
of
the
world
in
a
new
time
and
did
come
to
learn
that
his
own
did
also
to
live
in
that
time
and
he
then
to
make
that
he
find
her
and
did
truly
come
unto
her
and
how
she
did
be
different
in
her
beauty
but
yet
to
be
utter
lovely
and
the
man
did
hold
an
utter
reverence
to
the
maid
that
had
been
his
wife
in
the
olden
dreamdays
so
that
his
reverence
of
love
did
live
in
him
like
a
constant
pain
and
anguish
of
sweetness
and
trouble
and
of
holy
thoughts
that
did
be
bred
of
her
lovely
companionship
and
of
his
memories
but
in
truth
i
gat
not
further
in
the
tale
than
this
for
mine
own
did
have
come
sudden
into
weeping
and
had
gotten
to
her
knees
and
did
hold
my
hand
against
her
breast
and
did
put
her
hand
gentle
upon
my
lips
and
in
a
moment
she
to
whisper
somewhat
through
her
tears
and
there
to
be
dear
motherhood
within
her
face
and
a
sudden
shining
of
memory
in
her
eyes
that
had
been
near
dreadful
only
that
it
did
seem
to
be
to
her
as
that
she
were
part
dreaming
and
the
strange
and
solemn
pain
did
come
also
unto
me
through
the
partopen
gateways
of
my
memory
and
i
to
remember
very
clear
and
with
an
anguish
in
that
moment
and
i
told
mine
own
how
that
the
babe
had
gone
onward
after
that
the
beloved
had
died
and
there
did
be
then
an
utter
quiet
upon
us
and
lo
sudden
the
maid
did
bend
unto
me
and
i
to
take
her
into
mine
arms
out
of
the
vague
dreamings
of
her
memorydreams
but
ere
she
did
be
come
outward
entire
from
the
haze
of
the
past
she
to
try
to
set
somewhat
into
words
concerning
this
memoryvision
of
the
babe
but
someways
to
be
strangely
dumb
and
i
did
be
silent
likewise
because
of
all
those
things
that
did
be
between
us
forever
and
forever
and
presently
she
kist
me
and
was
herself
again
and
she
went
from
me
to
attend
unto
our
food
now
that
did
be
truly
a
lovely
day
for
i
to
have
gat
sufficient
of
strength
that
i
did
be
able
to
have
interest
and
talk
with
mine
own
maid
and
she
now
to
be
well
rest
and
to
have
ease
in
her
dear
heart
concerning
me
and
surely
we
oft
to
laugh
and
did
make
jests
utter
glad
and
foolish
and
indeed
i
do
mind
how
that
i
askt
mine
own
an
olden
puzzle
that
did
come
out
of
the
vagueness
of
my
memorydreams
and
she
to
be
like
a
person
that
doth
hear
a
strange
familiar
thing
and
lo
sudden
she
to
say
as
that
she
gat
knowledge
from
beyond
eternity
that
it
did
be
when
that
he
was
a
little
hoarse
and
you
to
know
the
jest
and
to
have
troubled
it
oft
at
school
but
in
verity
it
did
be
a
strange
thing
to
have
from
our
memories
out
of
all
the
deep
of
time
and
we
in
truth
never
in
that
age
to
have
seen
or
to
have
known
that
ever
there
did
be
an
horse
or
to
mind
the
likeness
of
one
and
this
to
be
but
a
little
matter
yet
of
strange
and
peculiar
interest
as
you
to
agree
and
indeed
we
did
both
to
look
one
at
the
other
when
that
we
had
ended
and
did
wonder
what
an
horse
did
be
yet
in
the
same
time
did
have
a
vague
inward
knowing
and
so
we
to
look
ever
backward
through
dim
ages
and
surely
we
gat
presently
from
jests
unto
solemnness
and
the
maid
to
be
nigh
again
unto
tears
and
in
truth
i
then
to
bring
our
thoughts
and
our
speech
forward
from
the
abyss
of
the
years
and
did
cease
from
memorydreaming
for
that
time
and
so
to
have
the
maid
again
in
joy
yet
mayhap
something
wistful
odd
whiles
and
presently
i
to
tell
the
maid
an
hundred
thousand
things
concerning
the
mighty
pyramid
of
which
i
had
so
oft
said
somewhat
but
never
to
have
gat
so
great
a
chance
as
this
unto
a
plenty
of
time
and
so
nice
an
oneness
in
the
way
that
our
minds
did
go
and
surely
the
maid
did
be
eager
in
a
moment
and
did
be
husht
and
again
to
ask
constant
concerning
all
matters
and
in
verity
there
went
a
great
while
this
way
and
the
maid
to
have
an
utter
wonder
and
excitement
of
all
that
i
to
tell
for
truly
it
did
be
as
that
a
man
of
this
age
should
come
downward
from
a
great
star
in
the
heavens
and
to
tell
of
wonders
and
new
things
and
you
to
understand
how
she
did
feel
and
of
all
things
that
did
most
have
a
happiness
unto
the
maid
i
to
perceive
that
the
great
life
and
humanness
of
the
millions
to
dwell
within
her
imaginings
as
a
cloud
of
warmth
and
quiet
joy
for
i
did
show
this
thing
to
her
so
well
as
i
was
able
and
in
truth
you
shall
tell
me
in
honesty
whether
that
i
have
made
the
same
likewise
clearseen
unto
you
and
she
as
you
shall
mind
did
be
a
maid
that
had
grown
all
her
life
in
a
refuge
that
did
be
shaken
with
hauntings
because
that
it
lackt
the
power
of
the
earthcurrent
to
protect
and
with
a
people
that
did
be
weakconceived
through
great
thousands
of
years
and
where
love
did
bloom
something
faded
even
in
youth
and
youth
to
have
lack
of
the
lifeblood
of
an
utter
joy
such
as
did
be
ours
and
likewise
to
many
that
did
be
of
the
mighty
pyramid
though
truly
there
did
go
millions
then
as
now
that
did
never
to
know
love
though
the
name
did
be
in
their
mouths
and
they
to
have
belief
that
the
sweet
kernel
did
be
in
their
hearts
but
in
verity
this
to
be
love
that
your
life
shall
bound
in
you
with
abundance
and
joy
dwell
round
you
and
your
spirit
to
live
in
a
natural
holiness
with
the
beloved
and
your
bodies
to
be
a
sweet
and
natural
delight
that
shall
never
be
lost
of
a
lovely
mystery
that
doth
hold
a
perfect
peace
each
unto
the
need
of
the
other
and
all
to
be
that
there
go
round
about
you
a
wonder
and
a
splendour
all
the
days
and
the
nights
that
you
shall
bethe
man
with
the
woman
the
woman
with
the
man
and
shame
to
be
unborn
and
all
things
to
go
natural
and
wholesome
out
of
an
utter
greatness
of
understanding
and
the
man
to
be
an
hero
and
a
child
before
the
woman
and
the
woman
to
be
an
holy
light
of
the
spirit
and
an
utter
companion
and
in
the
same
time
a
glad
possession
unto
the
man
and
lo
if
one
to
die
then
the
soul
of
the
other
shall
fail
and
that
one
never
to
have
full
life
again
in
that
bitter
parting
and
this
doth
be
the
true
human
love
and
all
else
that
be
not
like
to
this
with
the
man
and
with
the
woman
doth
be
but
a
borrowing
of
the
name
of
love
for
that
quiet
desiring
which
is
but
an
endurance
beside
love
which
doth
be
between
they
that
be
not
mated
both
in
their
souls
and
in
their
bodies
and
this
telling
to
take
no
heed
to
those
base
joinings
that
be
made
for
purposes
of
wealth
or
desire
or
other
piteous
ends
for
in
verity
these
to
have
no
more
dealings
with
the
thing
that
i
do
tell
upon
than
hath
the
merchanting
of
goods
or
the
need
of
a
glutton
but
the
thing
that
i
do
have
upon
my
heart
doth
be
that
dear
and
uplifting
power
of
love
which
i
to
set
forth
in
this
mine
own
story
for
in
truth
i
to
have
known
love
and
to
need
death
when
that
i
be
parted
from
mine
own
now
surely
mine
own
did
come
twice
and
thrice
unto
weeping
as
i
did
tell
of
this
thing
and
that
which
did
set
her
memory
backward
unto
the
ways
of
the
lesser
redoubt
and
presently
i
did
cease
from
my
tellings
because
that
she
did
so
be
gone
into
pain
of
her
memories
but
indeed
she
then
to
beg
me
that
i
go
forward
again
for
truly
she
to
need
in
the
heart
that
she
know
and
to
strive
to
be
no
more
in
grief
for
the
telling
and
i
then
to
say
on
and
did
tell
upon
the
might
and
wonder
and
great
olden
delight
of
the
underground
fields
that
were
below
the
great
redoubt
as
you
do
know
and
i
told
how
that
they
went
downward
an
hundred
strange
miles
that
did
be
dug
of
the
labour
of
millions
and
of
the
years
of
eternity
and
i
set
out
unto
mine
own
concerning
that
there
did
be
wondrous
villages
spread
through
that
great
and
hidden
country
that
did
be
in
the
underground
and
how
that
great
millions
of
the
peoples
did
live
there
and
made
a
constant
labour
in
those
deep
lands
and
countries
that
did
be
truly
so
monstrous
in
all
as
an
huge
continent
and
i
showed
mine
own
how
that
there
did
be
wondrous
processes
that
did
be
learned
in
the
ages
and
how
that
water
did
be
made
in
chemistry
and
truly
she
to
nod
to
this
because
that
she
did
mind
upon
the
powder
that
we
did
use
but
truly
the
powder
to
have
to
be
made
in
the
first
as
you
shall
think
and
we
but
to
advantage
ourselves
of
that
which
did
result
and
i
to
speak
to
her
of
the
making
of
the
powder
rather
than
of
the
way
that
it
afterward
to
make
chemistry
with
the
air
unto
water
and
i
told
the
maid
how
that
there
did
be
mighty
underground
pipes
that
went
across
the
night
land
and
did
be
mayhap
oft
so
much
as
twenty
great
miles
deep
in
the
world
and
did
come
upward
into
the
seas
of
the
land
and
all
to
have
been
made
secret
and
hid
from
the
monsters
of
the
land
as
i
to
know
from
much
readings
of
the
histories
and
mine
own
then
to
tell
me
that
they
did
lack
to
have
any
such
great
wonders
below
the
lesser
redoubt
but
that
there
did
be
utter
monstrous
caverns
where
that
there
had
been
alway
a
strange
and
uncouth
country
of
husbandry
and
lit
from
the
earthcurrent
and
they
also
there
to
bury
their
dead
and
all
had
been
alack
through
great
thousands
of
years
as
she
did
know
of
their
records
and
had
grown
dimlit
and
lonesome
and
a
land
of
deepness
to
starve
the
spirit
with
an
utter
strangeness
and
discomfort
where
that
the
men
went
quietly
as
ghosts
through
many
ages
and
all
a
place
in
dire
want
of
sound
and
laughter
yet
this
all
to
have
been
surely
different
a
monstrous
age
gone
when
that
the
earthcurrent
did
be
a
power
in
the
lesser
redoubt
and
the
humans
to
be
in
plenty
and
of
good
and
natural
health
and
courage
of
life
and
truly
to
mind
upon
that
place
doth
alway
to
set
a
fresh
wonder
in
me
that
mine
own
did
be
so
lovely
and
wholesome
of
spirit
and
wise
and
in
knowledge
and
good
force
of
her
being
but
so
it
did
be
with
her
and
she
to
have
been
surely
alway
that
one
that
did
be
mine
own
and
i
then
to
tell
mine
own
maid
concerning
the
lowest
field
which
did
be
the
country
of
silence
and
was
the
place
of
memory
unto
all
the
great
millions
where
did
linger
and
bide
the
ghosts
of
an
hundred
billion
griefs
and
the
drifted
thoughts
of
sorrowful
hearts
and
there
to
live
a
great
hallowedness
and
a
mystery
of
silence
and
an
holiness
and
a
greatness
as
that
it
did
be
the
expressing
of
all
that
doth
be
noble
and
everlasting
that
ever
did
come
out
of
the
heart
of
man
and
all
the
lost
dead
of
eternity
so
that
the
spirit
of
a
man
did
seem
to
go
on
great
wings
unto
lovely
and
splendid
resolvings
if
that
he
but
to
walk
lonely
awhile
in
that
country
that
surely
did
be
never
lonesome
unto
the
spirit
and
lo
the
maid
did
be
all
husht
as
i
did
speak
and
did
look
downward
unto
me
with
her
eyes
very
bright
and
lovely
with
the
thinkings
and
tears
that
did
stir
within
her
and
sudden
she
to
ask
whether
that
i
did
make
my
resolve
to
my
journey
whilst
that
i
walkt
in
that
place
and
she
to
look
very
intent
and
beautiful
upon
me
as
she
did
question
and
indeed
i
saw
that
she
to
mean
a
lovely
praise
unto
me
as
you
to
perceive
and
truly
i
did
feel
a
little
strange
as
that
i
did
be
both
glad
and
shy
in
the
same
moment
and
she
then
to
ease
me
of
any
answer
for
she
gat
upward
upon
her
knees
and
she
put
her
two
hands
to
the
sides
of
my
face
and
bid
me
to
look
into
her
eyes
and
to
know
that
she
loved
me
with
her
soul
and
with
all
that
did
make
her
to
be
and
afterward
she
kist
me
very
gentle
upon
the
forehead
and
did
be
then
husht
awhile
as
that
she
to
be
in
thought
yet
oft
she
did
look
downward
at
me
and
did
have
a
beauty
of
love
and
honour
within
her
eyes
so
that
they
alway
to
shine
as
she
did
look
at
me
and
presently
the
maid
did
sit
again
beside
me
and
slipt
her
two
hands
into
the
one
of
mine
as
did
be
ever
my
desire
and
she
to
love
that
she
give
me
this
delight
and
likewise
she
to
have
joy
to
herself
in
this
lovingness
and
we
then
again
to
have
talk
and
i
did
tell
mine
own
somewhat
of
the
history
of
the
olden
world
and
she
did
have
dim
memories
as
in
dreams
of
the
days
of
light
yet
scarce
that
she
could
believe
it
of
truth
but
she
to
have
knowledge
of
the
olden
love
days
within
her
spirit
and
to
mind
that
there
did
be
alway
as
it
did
be
a
lovely
and
golden
light
upon
the
world
but
she
not
to
know
truly
whether
this
to
be
but
the
holy
glamourlight
that
memory
doth
set
about
a
past
loveliness
and
to
have
no
remembering
of
the
sun
but
yet
to
be
made
ready
by
her
memories
unto
believing
and
i
to
know
of
certainty
but
yet
even
i
that
do
tell
this
my
tale
did
but
perceive
the
days
of
the
light
as
in
a
far
and
vague
dream
and
to
remember
it
but
in
the
chief
by
the
glory
of
lost
sunsets
that
had
cast
an
holiness
upon
my
heart
and
of
the
hush
of
dawns
that
had
made
ready
my
spirit
in
the
gone
ages
to
look
quietly
unto
my
death
and
surely
you
to
go
with
me
in
all
this
thing
and
to
have
felt
within
your
own
spirit
that
uplifted
wonder
that
doth
shake
the
soul
with
the
lost
beginning
and
with
the
unknown
end
when
that
you
have
lookt
through
the
sorrow
of
the
sunset
and
stood
silent
before
the
quiet
voice
that
doth
make
promise
in
the
dawn
but
in
verity
we
that
had
near
lost
our
memory
of
the
surety
of
these
great
wonders
did
have
memory
of
love
and
this
to
be
most
beautiful
unto
my
heart
for
it
but
to
show
the
more
how
that
love
doth
live
forever
and
doth
make
an
holiness
in
all
places
and
doth
give
companionship
and
satisfying
so
that
to
have
love
is
to
have
all
and
to
have
escaped
this
wonder
is
to
have
missed
to
have
lived
and
i
to
find
then
that
mine
own
did
have
no
knowledge
of
the
way
that
the
world
did
be
in
that
future
age
and
did
lack
to
know
that
there
abode
mightily
above
us
in
the
everlasting
night
the
dead
starkness
of
the
world
where
did
bemayhap
two
hundred
great
miles
above
ussnow
and
the
eternal
desolation
of
a
lost
world
that
did
be
once
the
lovely
world
of
the
olden
days
which
did
be
now
given
over
unto
night
and
silence
and
mayhap
there
did
wander
upward
there
memory
and
did
go
companioned
by
grief
but
indeed
i
to
delight
to
think
that
hope
and
love
did
build
houses
of
joy
about
the
dead
and
there
to
be
no
true
death
but
only
the
dying
of
days
yet
surely
this
doth
be
sorrow
enough
unto
the
heart
and
the
soul
if
that
they
did
be
days
when
love
did
make
a
mystery
of
light
about
the
spirit
and
the
beloved
to
have
been
anigh
to
make
ever
a
sweet
wonder
unto
the
heart
but
i
to
cease
from
these
thoughts
for
we
to
face
our
life
brave
and
wise
and
to
take
both
the
sorrow
and
the
joy
unto
our
developing
and
to
hold
up
the
face
with
courage
when
that
grief
doth
come
anigh
and
to
see
that
we
grow
not
to
bitterness
but
unto
sweet
wholesomeness
and
there
to
be
joy
again
and
we
then
the
better
abled
to
have
that
delight
into
our
hearts
for
how
shall
joy
ever
to
come
truly
again
to
that
heart
which
bitterness
hath
made
a
place
for
the
abode
of
sorrow
and
truly
i
to
cease
from
these
thinkings
also
for
my
story
to
wait
upon
me
and
these
things
that
i
do
say
do
be
plain
unto
you
and
to
have
no
need
to
the
telling
and
so
did
i
tell
mine
own
maid
of
the
things
that
i
did
learn
from
the
little
metal
book
and
she
to
be
in
a
constant
wonder
and
delight
and
with
an
awe
and
newness
upon
her
and
sudden
there
did
some
olden
memory
stir
within
her
for
she
askt
me
in
one
instant
whether
that
i
did
remember
when
that
the
cities
did
move
alway
unto
the
westward
but
truly
i
had
no
remembering
of
this
thing
and
did
look
at
her
awhile
with
somewhat
of
a
trouble
upon
me
for
that
there
should
be
aught
lacking
in
my
memory
of
those
times
that
we
did
be
together
upon
this
world
was
a
fear
unto
me
and
a
vague
sorrow
alway
if
that
i
did
but
to
let
my
thought
go
that
way
though
indeed
i
did
ever
strive
to
wiseness
and
did
have
knowledge
that
there
doth
be
an
heartwearing
and
despair
and
needless
trouble
in
vain
regrets
but
yet
these
to
be
natural
unto
the
spirit
if
that
you
to
know
love
and
do
be
but
the
complement
of
the
lovejoy
and
mayhap
to
have
a
use
unto
the
sweetening
of
the
spirit
if
that
they
be
not
let
to
override
the
reason
and
whilst
that
i
did
look
unto
mine
own
that
she
help
me
to
remember
she
did
strive
with
her
memory
but
in
the
end
did
fail
to
come
unto
aught
of
clearness
save
that
she
did
see
as
in
a
far
dream
yet
very
plain
a
great
metal
roadway
set
in
two
lines
that
went
forever
unto
the
setting
sun
and
she
then
sudden
to
say
that
she
did
see
in
her
memory
the
sun
and
she
to
have
a
strange
and
troubled
amazement
upon
her
and
there
did
be
cities
upon
the
great
road
and
the
houses
did
be
strangeseeming
and
did
move
forward
eternally
and
at
a
constant
speed
and
behind
them
the
night
did
march
forever
and
they
to
have
an
even
pace
with
the
sun
that
they
live
ever
in
the
light
and
so
to
escape
the
night
which
pursued
forever
as
she
did
tell
and
a
dread
and
terrible
chill
that
did
live
in
the
night
and
there
did
be
cities
far
forward
in
the
morning
sunshine
that
did
have
gone
before
at
speed
and
set
the
husbandry
of
the
world
and
to
be
finished
and
gone
forward
again
ere
that
certain
of
the
latter
cities
did
come
to
that
place
to
the
reaping
and
the
night
to
come
presently
to
that
place
but
this
not
to
be
for
some
part
of
a
year
after
that
the
crops
were
taken
but
how
long
this
might
be
she
not
to
remember
and
all
this
the
maid
did
say
to
me
as
out
of
a
strange
dream
and
i
to
have
set
it
down
and
to
have
made
it
so
clear
to
you
as
she
to
have
told
it
and
surely
it
doth
be
plain
then
that
she
to
speak
of
a
time
when
that
the
day
did
be
grown
to
a
monstrous
length
because
that
the
world
did
turn
but
slow
and
weary
and
it
to
be
a
sureness
as
you
shall
perceive
that
but
to
stand
still
in
that
age
of
which
naani
told
was
to
be
left
presently
in
an
utter
night
and
chill
that
should
last
mayhap
a
great
and
weary
year
and
in
verity
it
doth
seem
that
all
humanity
did
travel
forever
in
that
strange
age
when
that
to
stay
was
to
die
unprepared
in
the
bitter
night
and
to
go
forward
was
to
be
forever
in
the
sun
and
truly
this
doth
be
so
strange
seeming
to
me
as
to
you
and
much
i
questioned
the
maid
and
did
have
an
hurt
within
my
heart
and
a
pain
of
jealousy
and
sadness
to
grow
in
me
for
surely
she
did
speak
of
some
life
that
she
did
live
when
that
i
did
be
elsewhere
either
in
life
or
unknowing
and
in
verity
what
man
then
should
have
taught
mine
own
to
love
him
and
she
then
mayhap
to
have
had
no
remembering
of
me
and
truly
i
questioned
very
desperate
and
the
more
so
because
that
i
was
yet
weak
and
lacking
my
strength
to
be
composed
but
she
neither
to
remember
me
nor
any
other
man
of
that
time
and
to
have
no
memories
save
these
bare
things
that
she
to
have
spoken
out
so
strange
and
which
did
come
sudden
unto
her
out
of
all
the
deepness
of
the
years
and
the
lost
sorrows
and
joys
and
wonders
of
that
which
doth
make
a
world
of
humans
and
surely
my
questionings
brought
a
distress
upon
mine
own
both
because
that
she
did
be
troubled
by
the
way
that
my
love
did
bring
me
to
this
strange
anguish
and
because
that
she
also
to
have
pain
and
a
sudden
fear
that
there
did
be
ever
a
time
when
she
not
to
have
known
me
or
to
have
permitted
the
arms
of
another
and
she
did
then
strive
that
she
be
both
wise
and
strong
and
to
give
help
unto
me
and
to
take
reason
unto
her
own
easing
and
truly
she
to
show
how
that
she
did
be
all
unknowing
of
any
love
in
that
far
backward
time
but
it
to
be
possible
in
reason
that
she
to
have
gone
to
another
in
natural
course
the
while
that
her
heart
did
yearn
alway
in
vague
trouble
unto
her
own
that
her
spirit
did
mayhap
never
to
have
forgotten
and
truly
this
doth
be
the
way
of
life
and
a
bitter
thing
and
a
sorrow
to
joyous
love
to
think
upon
yet
i
here
to
be
set
to
the
tellings
of
truth
and
to
have
heed
to
all
that
reason
doth
show
to
be
but
mine
own
did
also
have
us
both
to
remember
that
there
did
be
equal
right
to
think
that
she
had
died
mine
own
maid
in
that
life
for
that
it
did
be
not
out
of
reason
to
think
that
she
had
been
voidhearted
unto
all
men
because
that
she
had
known
in
her
spirit
that
she
did
once
to
meet
her
own
and
did
be
thereafter
untuned
unto
all
other
men
that
ever
did
live
and
this
all
to
be
in
a
mist
and
we
to
go
vainly
and
of
her
will
she
did
think
that
no
man
did
ever
to
have
possessed
her
save
i
yet
this
to
be
mayhaps
only
the
prompting
of
her
love
and
she
then
to
kiss
me
and
to
say
that
there
did
be
no
surety
in
aught
but
only
that
we
did
have
been
together
before
and
have
borne
a
love
so
great
that
it
did
live
through
eternity
and
we
to
be
now
together
and
maybe
all
else
to
be
but
dreams
and
truly
i
did
have
a
fierce
hope
that
this
be
so
and
the
maid
likewise
so
to
hope
yet
to
be
less
bitter
with
rebellion
than
i
though
in
pain
upon
the
thought
for
she
did
be
so
utter
and
dreadful
glad
and
in
happy
thankfulness
that
we
did
be
now
come
together
again
in
the
end
and
did
mean
that
she
conquer
all
that
should
be
like
to
set
a
greyness
upon
our
joy
and
to
be
steadfast
unto
this
end
and
i
afterward
to
be
likewise
in
wisdom
when
that
i
was
come
the
more
to
strength
and
to
mind
that
i
suffer
vainly
for
that
which
did
have
no
surety
as
i
have
shown
and
moreover
i
did
have
no
power
upon
the
past
either
to
learn
aught
or
to
mend
aught
so
that
i
did
go
the
way
of
an
human
and
did
shake
free
from
these
broodings
and
strove
unto
forgetfulness
which
in
truth
doth
be
both
a
terror
and
a
mercifulness
as
doth
chance
and
i
kist
mine
own
maid
with
somewhat
more
of
the
years
within
my
love
and
she
to
kiss
me
very
sober
and
dear
and
to
desire
only
for
my
happiness
and
to
be
utter
mine
own
now
we
then
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
the
maid
to
see
me
unto
comfort
in
all
things
and
my
bandages
all
right
and
she
then
to
make
that
she
have
on
her
footgear
and
her
hair
to
be
bound
but
indeed
i
bid
her
that
she
to
dare
do
this
thing
when
that
she
to
know
how
i
did
delight
that
her
little
feet
be
bare
to
mine
eyes
and
her
hair
most
lovely
upon
her
shoulders
and
she
to
be
very
happy
that
i
so
to
have
an
utter
pleasure
in
her
dear
beauties
and
did
sit
beside
me
again
and
set
her
feet
very
sly
where
they
did
be
anigh
to
my
hand
for
she
to
know
that
she
did
be
mine
own
and
i
to
be
her
master
and
she
to
have
joy
that
she
to
have
to
render
her
beauty
unto
me
for
she
did
be
that
true
complement
unto
me
that
the
heart
of
a
man
doth
ache
for
eternally
and
so
presently
did
end
that
lovely
day
of
quiet
speech
and
togetherness
and
the
maid
did
prepare
me
for
my
slumber
and
she
then
to
lie
anigh
to
me
and
her
head
to
rest
gentle
beside
me
so
that
her
pretty
face
did
be
near
unto
my
breast
upon
the
right
side
and
she
to
give
me
at
the
first
a
loving
and
sober
kiss
that
did
be
somewise
to
set
a
guard
upon
her
tenderness
and
afterward
did
sleep
content
and
gentle
as
that
she
did
be
in
the
same
moment
a
child
and
a
woman
and
i
also
to
come
unto
slumbering
yet
did
know
vaguely
how
that
mine
own
did
rise
a
little
upon
her
elbow
this
time
and
that
and
look
very
loving
into
my
face
that
she
have
assurance
of
my
comfort
and
wellbeing
and
once
i
did
waken
proper
and
lookt
at
her
and
she
then
to
kiss
me
gentle
upon
mine
eyelids
and
bid
me
to
sleep
and
so
did
come
herself
unto
her
sweet
slumber
now
when
that
i
did
come
to
my
proper
wakening
i
to
hear
the
fizzing
of
the
water
and
to
know
that
the
maid
did
be
risen
a
good
while
and
had
made
her
toilets
as
i
perceived
in
a
moment
when
that
she
came
unto
me
for
her
hair
did
be
in
a
lovely
cloud
upon
her
shoulders
all
combed
and
made
ready
against
my
waking
and
she
to
have
bathed
as
i
supposed
in
some
warm
pool
that
did
be
among
the
bushes
upon
the
island
and
she
now
to
slip
her
footgear
that
her
feet
be
bare
unto
me
as
i
did
love
and
to
stand
a
moment
and
her
eyes
to
twinkle
gently
and
i
lookt
at
her
with
love
and
honour
in
mine
eyes
as
you
shall
know
and
she
to
have
dancing
of
sweet
pleasure
in
her
heart
that
i
so
to
look
upon
her
with
holiness
and
with
natural
love
and
surely
the
last
doth
be
unnatural
if
that
it
do
lack
the
first
but
my
love
did
burn
upward
out
of
my
being
so
that
the
flame
of
my
spirit
did
light
the
fires
of
my
heart
and
my
reason
to
add
coals
unto
that
fire
that
hath
lived
for
ever
and
doth
be
as
that
it
shall
be
never
quenched
and
mine
own
in
a
moment
did
kneel
beside
me
and
truly
someways
in
her
deep
intenseness
unto
me
for
our
love
did
make
all
the
world
holy
and
she
to
be
both
uplifted
and
as
that
she
must
give
all
the
humbleness
of
her
heart
unto
the
greatness
of
my
love
and
this
she
to
feel
and
her
deep
and
utter
love
to
make
it
as
that
she
did
be
all
a
passion
of
humbleness
unto
me
so
that
in
her
soul
i
did
rise
in
that
moment
upon
the
wings
of
my
love
and
to
seem
that
i
did
be
all
the
world
and
all
time
and
all
place
and
all
that
ever
she
did
need
unto
her
and
she
put
out
her
arms
to
me
and
her
eyes
did
shine
with
those
tears
that
do
never
be
shed
and
lo
in
a
moment
she
did
be
upon
my
heart
and
we
two
to
be
husht
together
in
content
for
our
need
did
be
in
the
other
and
truly
where
there
do
be
two
together
with
love
there
doth
be
neither
lack
nor
need
but
eternal
fulfilment
and
in
verity
this
to
be
my
hope
for
that
which
doth
come
afterwardthat
all
doth
be
leading
unto
so
glad
a
joy
as
this
and
that
all
pain
and
grief
and
all
that
doth
make
the
shaping
of
life
doth
be
but
a
process
by
which
we
be
eternally
perfected
from
living
unto
living
unto
each
fulfilment
that
doth
be
but
the
doorway
unto
greater
fulfilment
in
the
beloved
and
presently
mine
own
maid
did
loose
herself
gentle
from
me
and
washt
me
and
tended
me
and
very
husht
and
tender
and
something
downridded
of
her
dear
and
lovely
eyes
and
we
then
to
eat
and
to
drink
together
and
joy
so
great
and
quiet
did
be
upon
us
that
it
did
be
as
that
we
had
gone
into
an
eternity
of
peace
and
an
utter
content
and
surely
as
the
thought
did
stir
in
me
it
did
be
of
beauty
that
we
did
be
both
of
us
true
unto
the
other
in
that
life
and
i
never
to
have
kist
a
maid
until
that
i
kist
mine
own
and
she
to
have
been
likewise
and
to
have
fended
all
men
from
her
because
that
they
did
be
strangers
unto
her
inwardness
and
so
we
two
to
be
so
utter
together
both
in
that
our
spirits
did
be
knit
being
each
the
complement
of
the
other
and
because
that
we
had
no
secret
pains
of
remembered
things
to
set
any
apartness
between
our
hearts
and
in
verity
i
to
think
back
then
upon
my
jealousies
that
i
have
told
and
to
know
that
mine
own
did
never
to
have
given
herself
lightly
to
any
neither
to
have
taken
lightly
and
her
spirit
to
have
been
alway
mine
through
all
the
everlasting
and
mayhap
this
to
be
how
all
peoples
shall
come
to
be
in
the
length
of
time
only
that
to
us
had
come
the
great
wonder
that
we
did
early
meet
though
this
also
to
bring
that
utter
pain
which
doth
seem
to
slay
when
that
once
you
have
known
the
beloved
and
to
be
parted
and
so
i
to
think
and
did
presently
ponder
with
a
great
and
strange
pity
upon
they
that
did
not
yet
have
met
the
beloved
and
they
mayhap
not
to
have
kept
all
for
the
beloved
but
to
have
been
light
with
that
which
doth
be
the
treasure
because
that
love
had
not
come
to
show
them
that
they
did
unknowingly
squander
the
strange
and
holy
glory
which
doth
be
the
possession
of
they
that
shall
come
to
the
beloved
and
say
all
that
is
thine
have
i
kept
for
thee
and
the
beloved
to
know
and
to
have
peace
in
the
remembering
but
what
doth
be
the
peculiar
sorrow
of
they
that
have
gone
overlightly
when
that
they
shall
meet
the
beloved
for
then
shall
there
be
a
constant
and
inward
regret
as
a
thorn
in
the
heart
that
they
not
to
have
observed
alway
that
holy
care
of
all
which
doth
pertain
unto
love
and
they
nigh
to
moan
in
the
spirit
if
they
had
but
known
if
they
had
but
known
yet
in
the
end
of
their
pain
shall
they
grow
unto
all
loveliness
if
that
now
they
have
truly
come
upon
love
and
to
live
with
love
for
this
to
be
the
especial
glory
of
love
that
it
doth
make
unto
all
sweetness
and
greatness
and
doth
be
a
fire
burning
all
littleness
so
that
did
all
in
this
world
to
have
met
the
beloved
then
did
wantonness
be
dead
and
there
to
grow
gladness
and
charity
dancing
in
the
years
and
there
to
be
yet
one
thing
upon
which
mayhap
i
not
to
have
thought
sufficient
for
it
doth
be
this
that
they
who
did
err
as
i
have
shown
shall
be
the
greater
for
their
pain
and
let
this
be
to
cheer
you
if
that
you
have
done
foolishly
and
thought
not
upon
that
day
when
the
beloved
shall
come
for
pain
is
but
the
voice
of
development
or
destruction
and
truly
you
to
suffer
the
first
if
that
love
doth
work
in
you
but
truly
the
more
that
you
have
lacked
the
greater
shall
be
your
pain
for
the
more
change
there
doth
need
be
in
you
and
so
would
i
have
you
now
to
think
and
to
know
that
the
beloved
shall
come
and
so
shall
you
live
in
glad
care
of
all
your
being
that
you
be
able
to
come
unto
the
beloved
in
that
day
and
to
say
with
beauty
and
human
joy
in
your
heart
even
as
i
have
said
and
thus
shall
you
miss
that
bitter
pain
but
yet
truly
you
to
be
like
to
heed
not
this
until
that
love
doth
come
upon
you
and
i
therefore
to
cease
from
this
vain
setting
of
mine
inward
reasonings
but
truly
when
that
day
be
come
as
i
have
told
you
to
know
how
that
there
went
alway
with
me
in
this
mine
own
story
which
i
tell
the
simplicity
of
truth
and
how
that
i
did
be
minded
only
that
you
to
know
and
thereby
that
you
have
gentle
wisdom
that
you
lay
not
up
pain
for
that
day
yet
if
you
do
lack
to
go
with
me
you
to
need
that
developing
which
shall
then
come
upon
you
and
so
shall
you
perceive
how
my
thoughts
did
go
to
and
fro
as
i
did
eat
with
mine
own
and
so
in
the
last
i
to
find
that
i
did
think
very
serious
and
i
then
to
cast
from
me
this
pondering
and
to
have
that
utter
joy
which
did
be
upon
us
and
to
seem
that
it
did
fill
all
that
strange
country
of
seas
and
lo
after
we
did
be
done
of
eating
and
drinking
which
did
be
but
a
little
time
as
you
shall
think
the
maid
did
ease
me
to
an
upward
sitting
and
had
my
back
very
nice
to
an
olden
stump
which
did
be
light
and
she
to
push
unto
me
and
mine
own
did
sit
then
beside
me
so
that
mine
arm
did
come
most
natural
about
her
and
she
there
to
be
nestled
all
gleeful
and
content
so
that
my
heart
did
be
doubly
tender
unto
her
and
i
took
the
abundance
of
her
hair
and
set
it
about
my
neck
and
upon
my
breast
so
that
it
did
near
to
cover
me
in
the
upward
part
and
we
both
then
to
laugh
as
that
we
did
be
two
children
because
that
love
did
make
us
so
utter
young
in
the
heart
and
our
hands
to
be
hid
under
the
beauty
of
the
maids
hair
and
i
to
have
her
then
that
she
explain
just
how
great
she
did
love
me
and
you
that
go
with
me
do
know
how
that
this
doth
be
a
delight
that
is
never
done
neither
to
be
set
only
into
words
and
all
that
day
we
did
be
wondrous
happy
save
once
when
we
saw
that
there
were
humpt
men
upon
the
shore
about
the
flattopt
rock
where
did
be
the
fight
but
what
they
did
there
we
not
to
be
able
to
see
only
that
presently
they
went
away
and
indeed
seemed
to
have
no
thought
unto
us
neither
any
knowledge
and
so
did
be
gone
again
into
the
forests
and
we
saw
no
more
of
them
after
that
time
and
afterward
we
to
be
lost
utter
in
happiness
now
upon
the
tenth
day
i
did
be
so
come
into
health
that
i
to
walk
a
little
way
to
and
fore
upon
the
island
and
mine
own
did
go
with
me
and
so
i
to
pace
a
good
while
and
afterward
to
rest
again
and
mine
own
then
to
bring
mine
armour
to
me
which
she
had
scoured
very
nice
but
truly
the
armour
did
be
sore
broke
and
bent
and
did
be
jagged
inward
this
place
and
that
with
the
monstrous
strength
of
the
humpt
men
when
that
they
did
strike
me
with
the
great
sharp
stones
and
in
verity
how
i
should
ever
come
again
to
wear
this
protection
i
to
be
in
doubt
yet
truly
it
had
been
a
wondrous
suit
of
strength
that
had
kept
my
life
within
me
when
that
i
had
been
so
deadly
beset
and
i
to
know
that
it
to
be
yet
like
to
save
both
our
lives
if
that
we
could
someway
straighten
it
and
ease
the
broken
jags
from
wounding
me
afresh
and
i
thought
a
time
and
the
maid
with
me
and
afterward
we
gat
that
stump
upon
which
i
had
leant
and
had
this
to
be
for
an
anvil
and
we
found
then
smooth
stones
of
different
sizes
and
these
to
be
for
hammers
and
we
wrought
all
that
day
with
restings
upon
the
armour
and
surely
we
beat
it
into
a
very
good
shape
from
the
inward
and
the
broken
parts
we
beat
smooth
so
that
they
should
not
wound
and
in
the
end
to
have
mine
armour
fit
to
go
upon
me
and
i
by
now
as
you
shall
think
to
be
drest
part
in
my
garments
but
not
all
for
there
did
be
yet
some
of
the
bandages
upon
my
body
so
that
for
the
main
i
did
wear
the
cloak
that
the
bandages
be
easily
come
at
and
all
that
day
did
be
utter
happy
whilst
that
we
workt
for
we
to
be
together
and
on
the
morrow
as
we
do
say
which
was
the
eleventh
wakening
upon
the
island
the
maid
and
i
to
talk
long
and
oft
whilst
that
we
yet
worked
upon
the
armour
and
we
to
ponder
the
best
way
that
we
continue
to
our
journeying
for
indeed
i
was
not
come
to
my
strength
yet
was
i
very
earnest
that
we
go
forward
early
but
in
the
same
time
i
did
fear
lest
that
we
meet
with
aught
of
danger
and
i
to
be
alack
because
that
i
was
yet
weak
and
presently
the
maid
and
i
both
to
think
upon
the
same
thing
for
she
to
cry
out
concerning
the
raft
and
i
to
have
the
same
word
in
my
mouth
and
in
verity
this
to
be
a
great
thought
for
then
should
we
be
able
alway
to
be
free
of
the
humpt
men
and
to
have
frequent
rest
when
that
we
be
weary
and
to
sleep
with
an
ease
in
the
mind
and
indeed
i
to
hope
that
the
labour
of
oars
should
be
something
less
than
to
go
upon
the
feet
and
surely
we
talkt
upon
this
a
good
while
and
afterward
we
left
the
armour
and
went
over
to
the
raft
and
so
to
learn
whether
we
should
have
power
to
make
it
something
more
stable
and
that
we
have
some
way
that
we
should
put
a
solid
matter
between
our
bodies
and
any
monster
that
should
chance
to
swim
under
us
and
we
went
then
together
over
all
the
little
island
for
i
did
search
for
some
bush
that
should
have
a
long
tendril
in
plenty
and
supple
and
so
to
suit
for
binding
but
truly
there
did
be
no
such
bush
in
all
the
island
and
this
to
put
me
in
trouble
as
you
shall
suppose
yet
was
there
a
sufficient
plenty
of
small
and
upright
trees
that
did
seem
very
good
for
any
purpose
of
structure
and
when
we
had
gone
all
about
the
island
and
found
naught
that
should
bind
the
maid
to
say
with
a
pretty
jesting
that
we
should
cut
her
hair
and
plait
it
to
be
for
cords
and
surely
even
as
the
words
did
come
from
her
they
to
set
me
upon
the
thing
that
should
supply
our
need
for
i
stoopt
sudden
to
the
grass
that
did
grow
oft
and
plenty
in
this
place
and
that
and
was
so
tall
as
my
thigh
and
to
my
head
in
the
middle
of
the
dumpings
where
it
did
sprout
and
lo
it
was
wondrous
tough
and
the
maid
to
have
likewise
perceived
the
thought
almost
at
that
moment
but
i
to
have
been
the
first
this
time
and
so
to
tease
her
for
truly
we
had
grown
that
we
did
nigh
alway
to
discover
all
things
in
the
same
instant
as
you
mayhap
to
have
seen
but
i
did
surely
be
first
this
time
and
must
kiss
her
as
we
do
kiss
little
ones
that
they
be
eased
in
their
dismays
and
disappointments
and
she
to
see
how
i
did
mock
her
and
she
to
pretend
to
weep
and
surely
how
could
she
even
to
pretend
when
that
she
did
not
be
able
to
keep
her
pretty
mouth
from
searching
with
laughter
unto
mine
but
must
be
kissed
full
and
plenty
in
our
constant
joyfulness
and
we
cut
then
a
good
armload
of
the
grasses
using
the
knife
and
had
those
to
our
camp
for
we
did
be
homely
now
unto
that
place
as
you
shall
think
and
the
maid
then
to
show
me
plaiting
and
how
that
we
could
work
in
the
grass
piece
by
piece
so
that
we
should
plait
unto
any
length
that
we
to
need
and
all
that
day
we
workt
and
did
be
very
happy
together
but
when
that
we
came
to
the
time
of
our
slumber
the
maid
had
done
twice
and
thrice
so
much
as
i
and
surely
she
came
over
to
me
and
kist
me
very
grave
that
i
should
be
not
to
fret
even
as
i
did
kiss
her
with
gentle
mocking
concerning
the
thought
about
the
grass
and
so
did
she
make
level
with
me
by
this
impudence
and
quaint
sweetness
and
on
the
next
day
which
did
be
the
twelfth
i
took
the
diskos
and
on
that
day
i
cut
down
six
of
the
trees
and
alway
the
maid
did
bring
her
plaiting
that
she
be
near
me
and
when
i
had
cut
the
six
trees
she
had
me
to
cease
lest
that
i
risk
to
open
any
wound
and
truly
they
to
have
healed
very
wonderful
and
afterward
we
to
plait
all
that
day
and
did
also
finish
the
armour
and
did
be
content
and
utter
happy
and
on
the
thirteenth
day
i
counted
the
tablets
and
found
that
we
yet
to
have
sufficient
if
that
we
came
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
within
any
reasonable
time
but
i
insist
that
i
should
eat
no
more
now
than
did
be
my
usual
way
and
though
mine
own
did
beg
and
to
coax
me
and
even
to
try
whether
that
a
naughty
and
loving
anger
should
do
aught
to
shift
me
i
not
to
alter
from
my
deciding
which
was
based
upon
my
reason
and
upon
my
intention
that
mine
own
should
never
to
go
in
hungerdanger
whilst
that
there
did
be
life
in
my
body
and
when
that
the
maid
did
show
this
dear
and
pretty
anger
i
to
take
her
into
mine
arms
and
to
tell
her
how
i
did
reverence
and
love
her
and
that
she
did
be
all
beauty
unto
me
and
i
but
to
love
her
the
more
because
that
i
did
know
the
reason
for
her
dear
shaping
of
anger
unto
me
and
she
then
to
kiss
me
and
yet
to
beg
again
that
she
have
her
way
in
this
thing
but
presently
i
did
show
her
that
my
reasoning
was
sound
in
this
matter
though
i
said
not
that
my
strongest
thought
did
be
unto
her
own
needs
and
she
to
have
to
agree
with
me
in
her
brain
even
whilst
that
her
heart
did
ache
to
feed
me
and
truly
i
to
love
her
but
the
more
as
you
shall
think
and
this
way
shall
you
ever
to
manage
a
dear
and
sensible
woman
that
doth
both
love
you
and
hath
reason
in
her
for
the
wise
man
and
he
that
hath
an
heart
unto
bigness
doth
be
never
hasty
to
command
but
indeed
i
speak
not
now
of
the
way
that
you
shall
go
with
a
woman
that
hath
the
lovefoolishness
upon
her
for
this
to
be
a
different
matter
as
you
do
know
and
a
woman
then
to
require
a
double
wit
and
tenderness
in
the
governing
but
also
to
need
to
be
commanded
mayhap
with
sternness
yet
with
the
more
love
now
when
that
we
wakened
on
our
fourteenth
day
upon
the
island
we
gat
to
work
so
soon
as
we
had
washt
and
eat
and
drunk
and
mine
own
to
see
how
my
scars
did
go
and
i
cut
seven
more
trees
that
day
which
made
thirteen
in
all
and
afterward
i
trimmed
the
trees
very
nice
and
when
this
was
done
i
cut
twelve
good
saplingtrees
and
two
more
very
thin
that
i
did
mean
to
be
for
paddling
the
raft
upon
the
water
and
mine
own
maid
did
sit
near
me
alway
and
never
to
be
ceased
from
her
plaiting
and
whilst
that
the
maid
did
plait
and
make
gentle
and
happy
talk
with
me
i
presently
to
sit
beside
her
and
had
her
beltknife
to
my
need
and
therewith
when
i
had
cut
bark
from
a
tree
i
made
a
footlong
crosspiece
of
wood
which
i
did
fasten
with
pegs
and
some
lashing
unto
the
end
of
one
of
the
paddleshafts
and
i
took
then
a
piece
of
the
bark
so
big
mayhap
as
would
cover
my
thigh
and
shaped
broad
one
end
and
thence
to
a
point
and
when
i
had
made
holes
in
the
piece
of
bark
i
lasht
the
broad
end
to
the
crosspiece
and
the
end
that
did
be
narrowed
i
lasht
secure
to
the
shaft
and
likewise
made
holes
down
the
length
of
the
bark
and
lasht
it
also
thereby
to
the
shaft
and
thiswise
i
had
a
pretty
good
paddle
that
did
be
about
ten
feet
long
in
the
clear
shaft
and
the
head
to
be
somewise
two
feet
more
mayhap
and
when
this
was
done
i
shaped
the
handle
so
small
as
might
come
into
the
grasp
of
the
maid
and
did
jest
her
very
loving
and
gentle
that
she
give
me
so
great
a
work
because
that
she
have
her
hands
so
little
and
truly
she
presently
to
stop
me
of
my
mocking
for
she
put
her
pretty
hands
upon
my
mouth
and
i
then
to
have
to
mumble
and
to
laugh
and
so
she
to
go
forward
again
with
the
plaiting
and
when
i
had
made
the
one
paddle
i
made
also
the
other
but
something
more
rough
and
heavy
and
suited
unto
my
strength
and
so
did
be
very
well
pleased
for
they
did
be
made
more
of
my
reason
than
of
memory
yet
had
i
used
somewhat
of
the
kind
upon
the
quiet
lakes
which
did
be
in
the
country
of
silence
and
we
then
to
join
in
the
plaiting
and
thus
with
happy
talk
and
our
times
of
eating
until
that
we
did
be
come
again
to
our
slumber
and
on
the
fifteenth
day
when
that
we
had
gotten
up
and
washt
and
eat
and
drank
the
maid
did
look
unto
my
bandages
and
did
consider
that
i
be
healed
very
good
if
but
that
i
not
to
overstrain
my
body
and
we
then
to
dance
half
in
play
and
half
in
victory
but
gentle
and
afterward
she
to
come
with
me
that
she
give
me
aid
that
we
get
the
trees
unto
the
water
and
in
six
hours
we
rolled
the
trees
down
to
the
shore
and
did
begin
then
that
i
lash
the
saplings
across
the
trees
and
thiswise
to
hold
them
secure
into
a
raft
and
the
midmost
tree
i
put
something
more
forward
than
the
next
and
so
until
that
which
did
be
the
front
was
shaped
somewise
like
to
the
bow
of
a
ship
and
the
saplings
to
hold
the
trees
thiswise
when
that
i
had
set
the
lashings
about
every
sapling
and
every
tree
where
the
saplings
did
go
across
and
all
that
day
i
worked
pretty
constant
and
steady
until
that
mine
own
had
me
to
cease
awhile
lest
that
i
bend
overmuch
and
so
to
put
strain
upon
my
scars
and
i
to
be
reasonable
but
yet
to
go
forward
again
with
the
work
only
that
i
did
rest
now
this
time
and
that
and
so
did
all
to
prosper
and
on
the
morrow
which
did
be
the
sixteenth
day
upon
the
island
i
made
an
end
of
lashing
the
saplings
across
the
raft
and
i
set
up
also
two
rests
for
the
paddles
so
that
we
might
row
if
we
stood
upon
the
raft
and
afterward
being
ready
we
gat
together
our
gear
and
set
all
upon
the
raft
and
i
put
the
pole
that
the
maid
had
used
also
upon
the
raft
and
loosed
the
straps
from
that
first
raft
and
had
the
straps
for
our
requirement
as
heretofore
and
mine
armour
we
made
safe
on
the
raft
but
the
diskos
i
had
to
my
hip
as
ever
and
so
did
we
be
ready
to
leave
that
little
island
of
refuge
where
we
had
been
so
near
to
sorrow
but
yet
had
come
utterly
upon
joy
and
surely
mine
own
did
take
me
by
the
arm
and
she
to
stand
a
little
and
to
look
with
me
unto
that
bed
of
soft
herbage
where
she
had
laid
me
when
that
i
did
be
so
nigh
unto
death
and
she
then
to
kiss
me
very
sweet
and
loving
and
gentle
and
all
atremble
with
the
tears
and
love
that
did
stir
in
her
and
i
to
set
mine
arms
about
her
in
love
and
so
we
to
turn
and
to
put
off
then
in
the
raft
xv
past
the
house
of
silence
now
it
was
in
the
tenth
hour
of
that
day
that
we
put
off
in
the
raft
and
surely
we
found
the
paddles
to
go
very
easy
and
with
somewhat
of
balance
in
the
rests
which
i
had
set
up
as
you
do
mind
and
the
raft
to
go
forward
with
not
overmuch
of
labour
so
that
we
stood
the
maid
to
the
fore
paddle
and
i
did
be
to
the
hinder
one
and
we
pusht
very
steady
upon
the
paddles
and
had
the
raft
presently
to
a
speed
something
less
than
we
should
walk
over
the
rough
way
of
the
land
and
about
the
twelfth
hour
we
stopt
and
eat
and
drunk
and
went
on
again
with
our
easy
labouring
and
truly
when
that
we
gat
set
to
the
movement
we
scarce
to
wot
that
we
did
aught
more
than
rock
something
fore
and
back
upon
our
feet
and
so
the
hours
to
pass
and
we
to
have
a
constant
gentle
speech
one
with
the
other
and
the
maid
oft
to
look
back
unto
me
with
love
and
to
set
her
lips
that
she
tempt
me
but
yet
to
shake
her
head
most
dear
when
that
i
would
leave
my
paddle
that
i
go
forward
unto
her
and
when
that
the
eighteenth
hour
of
that
day
was
come
we
to
draw
inward
our
paddles
and
the
maid
set
the
cloak
very
nice
to
be
our
bed
and
afterward
we
eat
and
drank
and
so
presently
to
our
slumber
and
did
have
sleep
very
sound
and
happy
all
in
a
moment
as
it
to
seem
and
eight
good
hours
after
we
did
waken
both
of
us
together
and
lo
we
scarce
to
mind
where
we
did
be
for
a
little
moment
but
afterward
to
know
and
to
perceive
that
we
did
be
safe
and
naught
to
have
come
unto
us
in
our
sleep
and
surely
we
laught
each
in
the
face
of
the
other
for
we
did
be
so
joyous
to
be
wakened
each
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
other
and
after
that
we
had
kist
we
washt
somewhat
in
the
water
of
the
sea
and
so
to
our
food
and
when
we
had
eat
and
drunk
we
made
again
to
the
paddling
and
went
forward
thus
along
the
coast
very
peaceful
and
content
all
that
day
now
in
all
that
voyaging
did
talk
four
good
days
of
fourandtwenty
hours
each
for
we
made
no
great
haste
or
labour
but
went
easy
that
i
have
time
to
gather
my
strength
and
naught
to
happen
in
all
that
time
save
that
once
we
did
see
a
great
beast
to
come
upward
lumbersome
out
of
the
sea
on
to
the
shore
and
there
did
eat
and
browse
upon
the
herbage
in
that
part
or
so
it
did
seem
to
us
though
truly
we
did
be
over
far
off
to
have
surety
and
this
beast
not
to
put
us
into
any
horror
but
only
to
make
us
glad
that
we
be
afar
off
from
it
and
by
this
saying
i
to
mean
that
it
did
seem
unto
us
a
natural
thing
and
nowise
to
have
an
odour
of
aught
monstrous
to
trouble
our
spirits
and
this
way
did
be
all
the
creatures
of
that
country
and
truly
i
do
think
the
early
world
did
be
somewise
like
to
it
and
this
to
seem
to
make
true
that
olden
saying
that
extreme
things
do
meet
as
doth
be
overapparent
for
thus
doth
it
be
somewise
to
our
knowings
as
you
shall
perceive
by
your
reasonings
upon
olden
days
and
by
the
showings
of
this
mine
own
story
for
that
deep
world
to
have
put
forth
natural
creatures
that
did
be
even
as
might
be
those
that
did
live
in
the
beginning
though
i
to
make
no
point
of
this
but
only
that
it
doth
occur
to
my
thought
and
all
to
seem
that
it
did
be
bred
of
circumstance
and
condition
yet
this
to
have
no
saying
whether
that
there
to
be
a
spiritualforce
something
deeper
than
the
circumstance
for
this
to
be
outside
of
any
surety
but
not
offensive
unto
my
reason
but
this
thinking
also
neither
to
offend
me
that
although
muchand
mayhap
alldoth
be
modified
and
shapen
diverse
ways
by
the
circumstance
and
the
condition
yet
doth
there
be
an
inward
force
that
doth
be
peculiar
each
unto
each
though
mayhap
to
be
mixt
and
made
monstrous
or
diverse
by
foul
or
foolish
breedingas
you
to
have
knowledge
of
in
the
bodies
of
those
dread
monsters
that
did
be
both
man
and
beast
yet
also
i
here
to
say
that
maybe
all
diverse
breeding
not
to
be
monstrous
but
this
to
be
beside
my
point
for
i
to
be
now
set
to
tell
as
i
have
told
that
it
not
to
offend
me
to
suppose
that
there
to
be
this
inward
force
peculiar
to
each
shaping
of
all
bodies
that
do
hold
that
wondrous
quality
of
life
and
if
that
you
ask
me
that
i
give
example
to
make
clear
my
thought
i
to
say
that
it
doth
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
force
or
spirit
of
the
human
doth
be
peculiar
to
the
human
whether
that
it
to
be
a
cause
of
life
or
the
result
of
that
which
hath
been
evolved
out
of
a
condition
and
whether
it
to
be
the
one
way
or
the
other
you
to
know
that
where
this
force
or
spirit
be
found
untainted
there
is
man
and
i
to
be
not
opposed
to
think
that
man
doth
be
constant
alway
in
matters
of
fundament
and
neither
to
have
been
ever
truly
different
though
something
modified
in
the
body
and
surely
in
the
first
all
undeveloped
in
the
lovely
things
of
the
spirit
because
that
there
to
be
no
call
to
these
yet
presently
they
likewise
to
come
and
to
act
upon
the
flesh
with
refinings
and
likewise
mayhap
there
to
be
some
act
of
the
flesh
upon
the
spirit
and
so
to
the
state
of
this
age
of
this
our
day
and
to
that
far
age
of
which
i
do
tell
but
development
never
to
make
the
human
other
than
the
human
for
the
development
to
have
limits
peculiar
to
the
human
and
surely
it
doth
appeal
to
me
that
the
development
of
man
doth
lie
between
two
points
that
be
not
wondrous
wide
apart
and
man
to
have
power
that
he
arrive
very
speedy
from
one
unto
the
other
and
likewise
that
he
go
back
so
quick
or
even
the
more
hasty
yet
even
did
it
be
ever
proved
that
man
once
to
be
a
fish
i
to
have
no
cause
to
abate
the
first
part
of
mine
argument
but
to
have
the
more
need
of
the
thought
that
i
gain
power
to
accept
the
fact
for
i
still
then
to
have
no
occasion
that
i
think
man
to
have
been
truly
a
fish
or
aught
truly
different
from
a
man
but
only
that
he
did
be
once
modified
physically
to
his
need
and
to
be
still
possessed
of
the
manspirit
though
all
lackt
of
development
yet
truly
i
to
be
less
offend
in
my
reason
if
that
it
be
shown
that
man
did
be
ever
somewise
in
his
present
shape
though
mayhap
so
brutish
as
the
humpt
men
but
yet
i
do
be
ready
to
consider
all
matters
and
do
build
no
walls
about
my
reason
yet
neither
i
to
have
an
overready
acceptance
of
aught
but
to
need
that
my
reason
shall
approve
and
you
to
perceive
surely
that
i
here
not
to
speak
of
that
which
may
be
afterward
when
that
all
this
our
life
be
done
for
who
shall
say
how
much
or
how
little
we
then
to
go
forward
unto
loveliness
and
i
at
this
point
to
tell
you
that
i
do
have
a
wondrous
hope
of
beauteous
things
and
of
sweet
and
mighty
uplifting
and
furtherance
unto
that
glad
world
which
we
have
beheld
the
shores
of
when
that
we
had
stood
in
holiness
with
the
beloved
and
in
verity
i
now
once
more
to
my
story
and
to
be
glad
that
i
am
done
at
this
small
setting
forth
of
a
matter
which
did
need
words
because
that
it
did
have
root
in
this
mine
own
story
and
to
be
grown
of
it
and
from
it
now
there
did
be
one
other
thing
of
note
beside
the
sea
beast
whilst
that
we
did
be
upon
the
seas
and
this
did
be
the
strangeness
of
a
great
firehill
which
did
stand
in
the
sea
and
we
to
pass
very
nigh
unto
it
and
surely
the
sea
did
boil
about
it
yet
not
in
all
places
and
there
did
be
a
score
great
jets
that
did
go
upward
a
monstrous
way
and
did
roar
very
plain
to
us
across
the
sea
between
and
there
did
come
strange
gruntings
from
the
sea
about
the
base
of
the
firehill
and
these
i
to
conceive
to
be
made
by
the
upbursting
of
gases
in
this
place
and
that
and
surely
it
all
to
make
us
to
know
of
the
great
energy
that
did
be
wakeful
in
that
deep
country
and
we
yet
to
stare
backward
upon
that
hill
of
fire
and
force
for
a
great
while
after
that
we
had
come
past
now
beyond
this
there
to
be
naught
except
that
we
had
a
certain
care
as
we
did
come
to
that
place
where
the
great
sea
did
be
broke
to
smaller
seas
but
all
to
be
knit
with
passages
of
water
which
let
us
through
upon
our
way
and
surely
i
did
show
mine
own
maid
those
two
places
where
i
did
sleep
when
first
i
was
come
into
that
country
and
she
to
be
sweet
in
interest
and
alway
to
have
somewhat
that
she
would
learn
of
this
and
that
and
so
when
that
we
did
be
four
good
days
upon
the
water
as
i
have
told
we
to
come
to
the
land
upon
a
flat
place
of
the
shore
where
the
country
did
slope
upward
unto
the
mouth
of
the
first
gorge
of
which
you
do
mind
and
this
to
be
in
the
tenth
hour
of
that
day
and
we
likewise
to
have
begun
that
voyage
in
the
tenth
hour
as
you
do
remember
and
surely
it
to
have
been
a
sweet
and
peaceful
waterjourney
and
i
to
have
been
happy
if
that
all
that
did
be
yet
before
us
to
hold
so
much
of
pleasantness
and
safe
goings
but
indeed
there
to
be
much
danger
yet
to
come
as
you
do
know
and
we
to
have
our
hearts
set
in
courage
and
to
go
forward
to
conquer
for
surely
if
that
we
to
conquer
and
to
come
safe
into
our
mighty
home
there
to
be
then
that
we
have
all
our
lives
together
in
loveliness
and
this
to
be
truly
a
worthy
prize
and
a
glory
of
the
heart
to
end
and
to
repay
our
stress
and
surely
the
maid
and
i
did
presently
strand
the
raft
so
well
as
we
might
and
did
then
to
wonder
whether
any
should
evermore
to
behold
it
through
all
eternity
and
we
lookt
a
little
each
at
the
other
and
the
maid
then
to
cut
free
a
small
piece
of
the
wood
of
the
raft
to
be
for
an
after
remembrance
and
so
we
to
have
our
gear
upon
the
shore
and
the
maid
then
to
give
me
aid
that
i
get
once
more
into
mine
armour
and
so
i
presently
to
have
the
scrip
and
the
pouch
again
to
my
back
and
the
diskos
in
my
hand
and
all
in
readiness
and
the
maid
with
her
bundle
that
was
now
grown
small
and
her
belt
about
her
body
that
she
have
her
knife
unto
her
hand
and
surely
the
maid
then
to
kneel
and
to
kiss
the
raft
for
memories
did
gather
upon
her
and
she
there
to
have
one
more
breaking
from
all
that
did
be
the
first
part
of
her
life
and
you
to
give
your
understanding
and
so
to
have
a
quiet
sympathy
and
to
perceive
that
her
heart
did
be
like
that
it
should
stir
with
a
strange
trouble
of
sorrowing
in
that
moment
and
surely
i
stoopt
then
very
gentle
and
loving
and
had
mine
own
to
her
feet
and
i
led
her
from
the
raft
and
she
to
need
that
she
be
near
me
and
so
we
to
go
forward
and
to
make
upward
unto
the
dark
mouth
of
the
great
gorge
and
there
to
be
some
miles
unto
our
right
that
grim
and
utter
huge
mountain
whereon
afar
upward
in
the
monstrousness
of
the
night
did
be
perched
those
four
firehills
of
which
i
have
told
and
below
them
there
to
go
upward
the
great
hills
of
ash
that
had
been
cast
down
throughout
eternity
and
this
thing
had
the
maid
lookt
upon
for
a
great
time
and
did
be
never
done
of
her
wonder
neither
i
nor
any
human
that
ever
should
have
sight
of
so
great
a
wonder
and
so
we
to
have
come
presently
upward
into
the
high
mouth
of
the
gorge
and
did
go
onward
then
into
the
gloom
a
little
space
until
that
we
were
come
to
the
place
where
the
gorge
did
bend
sharp
unto
the
left
into
darkness
and
lo
we
made
pause
here
and
turned
again
unto
the
country
of
seas
that
we
have
a
last
outward
look
over
all
that
deep
and
living
land
that
did
be
hid
so
far
downward
in
the
everlasting
night
of
the
world
and
in
verity
it
did
be
a
solemn
thing
to
know
that
we
mayhap
to
be
the
last
of
the
olden
humans
that
should
ever
to
look
upon
that
country
and
i
to
wonder
in
that
moment
whether
that
the
humpt
men
should
ever
to
develop
in
some
far
eternity
unto
the
full
sweetness
of
the
spirit
of
humanity
which
i
did
think
to
be
inward
of
them
and
this
to
be
both
an
odd
and
a
natural
thought
to
have
then
as
i
do
see
but
at
that
time
i
only
to
think
it
and
not
to
wot
or
to
trouble
whether
that
it
did
be
odd
or
otherwise
and
i
to
think
that
country
did
be
somewise
as
the
olden
time
renewed
but
truly
we
to
look
upon
early
things
with
new
eyes
and
we
yet
to
look
awhile
and
to
be
husht
and
to
hark
in
those
last
moments
unto
the
far
mutter
of
the
great
firemountains
and
the
firehills
and
the
noise
of
life
which
did
go
over
that
land
and
we
even
then
to
be
but
a
few
short
pacings
off
from
the
silence
of
the
great
gorge
which
should
lead
us
presently
toward
the
eternal
strangeness
which
did
be
in
the
night
land
and
the
maid
did
hold
mine
arm
very
close
as
we
lookt
our
last
into
the
red
light
of
that
deep
and
hid
country
of
the
world
where
in
verity
we
had
come
so
utter
nigh
to
our
death
and
presently
i
turned
and
the
maid
slipt
her
hand
into
mine
and
the
tears
did
go
silent
down
her
face
because
of
all
that
did
be
prest
upon
her
heart
but
yet
not
to
be
all
of
sorrow
for
there
to
be
both
sorrow
and
happiness
and
also
there
did
be
somewhat
of
vague
emotion
that
she
never
more
to
look
upon
that
dear
island
where
she
had
nurst
her
man
again
unto
life
and
wellbeing
and
she
to
be
in
mind
of
all
those
places
where
she
to
know
that
in
afterlife
her
memory
to
wander
and
she
to
have
ofttold
tales
mayhap
unto
her
children
of
that
country
that
they
never
to
see
but
only
to
be
for
a
wonder
to
them
for
ever
and
we
past
then
round
the
mighty
cornerplace
of
the
gorge
and
went
forward
somewhat
stumbling
into
the
gloom
now
we
went
sixteen
hours
very
steady
and
with
naught
save
the
great
darkness
to
trouble
us
and
we
by
this
to
have
been
twenty
and
six
hours
since
last
that
we
had
sleep
and
surely
this
did
be
a
foolishness
because
that
i
to
need
that
i
come
into
my
full
strength
ere
we
reach
the
night
land
and
it
to
be
a
folly
that
i
should
overtire
myself
and
the
maid
to
have
said
so
much
and
indeed
then
we
came
to
a
safe
place
for
our
slumber
and
whilst
that
we
eat
and
drunk
we
made
count
from
my
notings
of
the
outward
way
and
so
did
decide
that
we
go
no
more
than
sixteen
hours
journey
each
day
through
the
gorge
and
to
sleep
alway
for
eight
good
hours
and
this
we
to
do
both
then
and
until
that
we
did
be
come
out
of
the
great
gorge
which
did
take
us
in
all
so
much
as
five
days
thiswise
and
surely
when
that
we
were
come
into
the
light
places
of
the
gorge
we
to
be
more
cheered
as
you
shall
suppose
yet
oft
did
we
be
half
smothered
with
the
horrid
gases
that
came
upward
in
this
part
and
that
as
you
do
mind
and
my
strength
did
grow
constant
as
we
journeyed
yet
would
the
maid
never
suffer
that
i
carry
her
but
went
alway
very
light
and
clever
and
was
grown
in
truth
set
unto
this
constant
wander
and
at
this
place
and
that
i
to
make
pause
that
i
show
mine
own
those
places
where
i
did
slumber
and
she
alway
to
need
that
she
come
unto
the
very
part
and
that
she
stand
for
a
little
moment
where
i
did
lie
so
lonesome
as
i
went
outward
unto
that
despairful
searching
and
alway
she
then
to
be
utter
tender
with
me
and
to
be
something
lacking
of
speech
because
of
the
calling
of
her
heart
and
surely
mine
own
did
be
alway
now
to
ask
me
when
that
we
should
be
come
unto
the
night
land
and
to
require
how
far
it
should
be
and
to
be
taken
with
a
growing
of
excitement
very
dear
and
natural
and
in
verity
i
to
be
almost
so
much
so
as
she
and
to
wonder
what
she
to
think
of
the
mighty
redoubt
and
of
all
that
strange
and
monstrous
land
and
above
all
these
i
to
be
shaken
unto
my
very
heart
that
i
have
the
maid
speedy
unto
safety
lest
after
all
even
though
we
to
have
come
so
far
there
somewhat
to
happen
of
woe
and
all
this
did
make
it
a
hard
thing
that
we
not
to
begin
to
race
and
to
exceed
the
hours
that
we
did
set
but
truly
we
had
wisdom
in
this
matter
and
slumbered
alway
after
the
sixteenth
hour
and
we
never
to
see
aught
of
life
in
all
that
great
and
desolate
gorge
for
there
did
be
only
the
gasburnings
and
the
boulders
and
the
stark
rocks
and
oft
the
rank
smellings
of
the
gases
and
alway
an
utter
and
everlasting
quiet
save
when
some
lonesome
gasfire
did
oddly
to
moan
or
to
whistle
and
the
whistling
to
sound
very
dree
across
the
great
waste
of
the
gorge
and
likewise
the
moaning
to
be
but
a
thing
to
make
the
loneliness
to
be
felt
in
the
heart
and
the
maid
to
feel
thus
with
me
and
alway
as
i
did
know
she
to
think
in
her
heart
that
i
did
come
through
that
place
alone
to
make
a
searching
for
her
into
the
unknown
lands
of
the
world
and
surely
i
did
be
but
a
natural
man
if
that
i
was
something
happy
in
my
heart
that
mine
own
so
to
ponder
and
to
remember
for
thereby
did
her
love
seem
ever
to
grow
and
likewise
a
man
doth
be
glad
in
his
spirit
and
natural
pride
that
his
maid
to
know
that
he
hath
done
wholesomely
of
his
best
for
her
need
and
you
but
to
think
upon
the
lovedays
and
to
hear
the
echoes
of
those
dear
proud
thoughts
that
did
so
to
swell
in
you
and
doth
not
all
to
go
so
strangely
with
familiar
pain
in
the
old
way
now
it
was
upon
the
fifth
day
in
about
the
seventh
hour
that
i
heard
oddwhiles
a
sound
in
this
place
and
that
of
the
gorge
as
that
the
rocks
made
husht
and
strange
sounds
at
us
and
i
to
have
the
maid
instant
very
nigh
to
me
and
the
diskos
to
my
hand
and
we
then
to
go
onward
with
a
great
caution
and
thrice
we
did
pass
places
where
gasfires
did
burn
and
dance
and
made
oft
a
low
moaning
and
somewhiles
a
little
whistling
and
the
other
sounds
yet
to
come
oddly
from
the
rocks
in
this
place
and
that
very
strange
and
unthought
of
yet
to
be
something
familiar
and
sudden
it
did
come
to
me
that
there
to
be
a
faraway
noise
in
these
sounds
though
they
to
seem
to
come
from
this
place
and
that
almost
to
mine
elbow
as
you
should
say
and
lo
i
knew
then
that
i
harked
unto
little
echoings
that
did
be
caught
by
the
near
rocks
and
to
come
from
some
far
and
mighty
sound
and
this
should
be
surely
the
monstrous
piping
of
the
great
gas
fountain
that
you
do
well
mind
and
in
verity
i
told
mine
own
in
a
moment
and
she
to
be
all
eager
with
me
because
that
this
did
be
both
a
wondrous
thing
and
to
be
also
a
landmark
to
show
that
we
did
be
nigh
to
come
out
of
the
gorge
and
our
journey
to
come
the
more
near
unto
an
ending
and
surely
we
lookt
ahead
very
earnest
and
there
to
be
so
many
strange
and
leaping
fires
to
our
front
that
we
not
to
be
very
sure
which
did
be
the
far
and
monstrous
dance
of
the
great
gas
fountain
for
truly
it
to
be
yet
so
distant
that
the
near
gasfires
did
make
more
upon
the
eye
up
all
of
a
weary
length
of
the
gorge
than
did
the
great
dance
of
the
faroff
fire
that
was
now
so
small
by
the
distance
and
presently
when
that
we
were
gone
onward
something
more
we
to
see
that
there
went
a
lightening
and
a
darkening
afar
along
the
gorge
so
that
the
background
of
the
night
was
made
to
lose
somewhat
of
the
intensity
of
its
darkness
as
with
constant
shudders
of
light
and
this
to
be
surely
the
far
away
dance
of
the
flame
of
the
great
gas
fountain
and
we
then
to
watch
alway
as
we
journeyed
and
to
see
how
that
the
vague
shudderings
of
light
did
grow
in
the
distance
of
the
night
and
did
merge
and
become
known
presently
in
a
strange
uplifting
and
falling
of
a
far
away
blue
flame
and
the
sound
now
to
come
more
steady
and
to
grow
in
a
long
while
into
a
monstrous
piping
very
great
and
wonderful
and
having
a
constant
change
in
the
note
and
we
to
come
past
the
last
of
the
lesser
fires
and
to
be
in
that
part
of
the
gorge
which
did
be
fireless
save
for
the
great
upward
dance
of
the
gas
fountain
which
did
now
to
be
grown
huge
and
plainseen
and
did
make
a
quaking
light
over
all
the
gorge
and
so
in
the
end
we
to
be
come
very
nigh
to
the
dance
of
the
monstrous
flame
and
did
be
half
stunned
by
the
noise
which
did
be
now
an
utter
and
furious
roaring
as
you
shall
remember
and
the
maid
and
i
did
stand
as
but
two
lonesome
strangers
in
the
mouthpart
of
that
deep
and
desolate
gorge
and
did
stare
voiceless
unto
the
great
flaw
and
mine
arm
did
be
about
the
maid
and
she
to
stand
very
nigh
to
me
and
neither
to
speak
and
surely
how
should
we
anywise
for
the
noise
did
be
so
huge
and
after
that
we
had
stared
a
great
while
we
turned
that
we
look
each
at
the
other
and
we
kist
very
sober
there
in
the
light
from
the
monster
flame
and
afterward
we
did
stare
again
at
the
flame
and
soon
turned
and
lookt
all
ways
and
did
marvel
to
see
the
great
throw
of
the
light
go
blue
and
spreading
and
strange
unto
great
distances
and
a
while
we
did
be
watching
the
way
that
the
faroff
side
of
the
gorge
did
come
plain
to
sight
when
that
the
flame
did
leap
and
truly
that
did
seem
a
far
and
lonesome
place
as
that
a
lost
and
forgot
world
of
desolate
mountains
did
be
there
and
lo
we
now
to
look
that
we
should
see
somewhat
of
the
way
that
our
journey
to
go
and
surely
naught
to
be
clear
shown
save
when
the
flame
did
rise
oddwhiles
to
a
monstrous
height
and
this
to
be
because
of
the
huge
rocks
that
did
stand
about
the
flame
yet
something
i
was
abled
to
show
the
maid
of
the
bottom
part
of
the
mighty
and
utter
monster
slope
that
did
be
the
last
way
of
our
journey
ere
we
were
come
to
the
night
land
and
we
then
to
go
onward
for
about
a
good
mile
that
we
be
not
so
deafened
by
the
noise
of
the
gas
fountain
and
it
did
be
now
beyond
the
seventeenth
hour
so
that
we
eat
and
drunk
and
made
our
rest
in
a
secure
place
among
the
great
boulders
and
lo
when
that
we
waked
we
eat
and
drunk
again
and
did
be
something
silent
as
we
to
gaze
at
the
flame
dancing
monstrous
and
lonesome
and
all
set
about
with
the
stark
and
mighty
rocks
which
did
be
like
unto
giants
of
silence
that
did
watch
forever
and
presently
we
had
our
gear
upon
us
and
we
went
forward
toward
the
utter
dark
of
the
mighty
slope
and
we
began
that
huge
climb
that
should
last
through
days
in
an
eternity
of
night
and
oft
in
the
first
hours
did
we
turn
about
from
our
blind
stumblings
and
gaze
downward
out
of
the
long
height
unto
the
loom
of
the
flame
that
did
shudder
far
below
in
the
night
and
made
a
quaking
light
in
that
far
darkness
and
so
did
we
leave
it
to
dance
forever
through
eternity
in
that
deep
and
lost
place
of
the
world
and
we
bent
all
our
will
and
our
strength
unto
the
climb
and
this
way
went
we
stumbling
for
sixteen
great
hours
and
by
that
time
had
come
to
a
pace
proper
for
that
task
and
to
be
something
numbed
and
seeming
grown
unreal
because
of
the
affecting
of
the
darkness
and
lo
for
eight
days
then
did
we
go
upward
forever
through
that
most
dreadful
night
and
after
the
first
day
we
crept
alway
upon
our
hands
and
our
knees
and
i
to
go
in
the
front
and
had
the
diskos
ready
upon
my
hip
and
i
took
two
of
the
straps
from
the
pouch
and
the
scrip
and
so
had
a
certain
length
and
i
set
them
from
the
waistbelt
of
the
maid
unto
mine
own
belt
and
so
did
know
ever
that
she
came
close
after
me
and
we
made
journeys
sixteen
hours
long
and
did
eat
and
drink
at
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
hours
and
likewise
we
eat
and
drank
ere
we
slept
and
again
upon
our
wakings
and
our
slumbertime
to
go
alway
somewheres
about
eight
good
hours
for
thus
did
i
be
heedful
that
we
have
all
our
strength
for
that
dreadness
of
the
journey
which
did
be
yet
before
us
across
the
fear
and
horrid
terror
of
the
night
land
and
oft
at
this
time
and
that
i
was
utter
sickened
and
awearied
of
reaching
forward
and
upward
forever
and
making
blind
fumblings
that
i
find
a
way
about
great
boulders
and
the
rocks
and
holes
that
did
be
in
our
path
in
the
dark
for
it
to
seem
that
we
went
lost
from
all
life
and
knowing
in
a
blackness
that
should
be
never
slackened
from
about
us
and
i
these
times
to
make
a
pause
and
to
call
softly
unto
mine
own
that
she
creep
up
nigh
unto
me
and
i
then
to
take
her
into
mine
arms
out
of
the
utter
blackness
of
that
night
and
so
to
give
and
to
have
comfort
and
surely
mine
own
did
whisper
once
unto
me
that
she
did
be
stunned
with
love
and
wonder
in
the
heart
for
she
to
never
cease
to
know
that
i
did
adventure
through
this
great
night
that
i
find
her
and
this
thing
did
make
me
very
warm
in
my
heart
as
you
shall
think
but
yet
i
to
stop
her
speech
with
a
gentle
kiss
and
she
then
to
know
that
she
be
dumb
concerning
her
thought
in
this
matter
yet
she
never
to
cease
from
remembering
it
and
did
be
the
more
stirred
with
the
trouble
of
her
lovely
secret
worship
for
in
verity
she
to
have
me
to
be
for
her
hero
and
this
to
make
me
in
the
same
moment
both
something
shamed
and
greatly
proud
and
so
we
to
be
together
and
after
such
pause
to
go
forward
again
with
a
new
courage
and
surely
it
did
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
think
that
because
we
to
go
upward
and
not
downward
we
be
not
like
to
fall
over
any
hid
cliff
in
the
night
for
i
to
have
now
some
little
knowing
of
the
slope
from
mine
outward
journey
yet
to
remember
upon
that
monstrous
pit
that
i
then
to
escape
and
so
to
go
with
care
and
indeed
upon
the
second
day
i
had
mine
own
to
creep
more
nigh
with
me
and
i
then
to
have
but
one
strap
between
us
and
the
other
i
set
a
stone
into
and
did
cast
the
stone
alway
before
us
as
upon
the
outward
way
and
you
to
mind
you
of
this
if
you
but
to
think
a
little
minute
and
oft
in
those
weary
days
in
the
darkness
did
i
make
gentle
whisperings
through
the
blackness
unto
mine
own
that
i
give
cheer
unto
her
and
she
alway
to
answer
very
sweet
and
loving
yet
ever
husht
as
i
did
be
and
in
verity
it
did
be
as
that
we
could
not
set
our
voices
loud
upon
that
mighty
slope
lest
some
enchantment
come
upon
us
as
it
might
be
said
and
indeed
each
time
that
i
cast
the
stone
the
noise
of
the
stone
to
make
a
little
trouble
and
dismalness
in
mine
ears
for
all
did
be
so
quiet
and
desolate
and
lost
in
night
that
it
to
make
us
to
need
to
be
likewise
so
quiet
and
to
desire
that
we
might
go
upward
so
silent
as
shadows
now
surely
i
must
tell
here
how
that
the
maid
to
have
alway
at
waking
that
same
awaredness
that
i
did
have
upon
the
outward
way
that
somewhat
did
be
nigh
to
us
and
to
seem
to
have
been
concerned
with
our
waking
and
i
likewise
to
have
also
the
same
knowledge
as
before
and
oft
as
we
did
go
i
to
feel
that
somewhat
did
go
near
to
us
and
this
to
put
something
of
a
fear
upon
me
because
that
i
was
ever
anxious
for
mine
own
and
i
to
have
her
to
be
alway
the
more
nigh
to
me
and
did
set
the
strap
from
her
to
me
even
when
that
she
slept
so
that
she
not
to
be
touched
and
i
to
lack
to
know
yet
she
to
have
no
fear
concerning
this
thing
but
to
feel
in
her
spirit
that
it
did
be
a
force
that
had
no
evil
intent
unto
us
but
more
neither
she
nor
i
to
know
and
i
in
truth
to
come
in
the
end
used
to
it
save
that
i
did
be
as
i
have
told
anxious
in
all
that
did
concern
the
life
and
wellbeing
of
my
beloved
and
so
did
we
go
onward
through
those
eight
days
and
it
soon
to
be
grown
cold
so
that
we
both
to
need
the
cloak
over
us
in
our
slumbers
but
in
the
journeyhours
to
need
naught
for
the
upwardgoing
did
surely
heat
us
very
well
and
there
also
to
be
come
presently
a
change
and
a
seeming
of
thinness
into
the
air
and
the
maid
to
remark
upon
this
and
likewise
that
the
waterpowder
now
to
be
that
it
not
to
fizz
so
plentiful
and
we
went
upward
as
it
did
seem
forever
and
journeyed
very
husht
and
steadfast
and
likewise
did
halt
at
set
times
that
we
eat
and
drink
and
did
alway
sit
then
very
close
and
quiet
and
in
love
and
so
alway
to
go
never
beyond
sixteen
hours
journey
each
day
and
very
weariful
even
so
much
for
it
to
be
a
sore
and
constant
labour
of
climbing
and
i
to
learn
the
hour
alway
by
a
little
shining
of
the
diskos
upon
my
timedial
which
i
have
told
did
be
somewise
as
the
watch
of
this
our
present
age
yet
truly
i
also
to
learn
that
i
made
somewhat
of
a
constant
number
of
forwardthrows
of
the
stone
in
an
hour
and
the
maid
to
be
the
first
to
discover
this
as
she
did
creep
behind
me
and
harked
steadfast
and
quiet
unto
the
clatter
of
the
stone
each
time
that
i
cast
it
and
she
sometimes
to
call
low
to
me
that
it
now
to
be
this
time
or
that
time
and
i
to
look
at
my
dial
as
i
have
told
and
oft
to
find
that
she
did
be
curiously
right
yet
otherwhiles
we
to
have
no
thought
to
count
but
made
a
constant
husht
talk
one
to
the
other
and
did
grow
odd
times
that
it
did
seem
to
us
that
we
did
be
two
spirits
there
in
an
everlasting
darkness
that
had
quiet
speech
one
to
the
other
and
to
be
seeming
gone
from
our
bodies
and
we
then
to
need
that
we
look
each
at
the
other
that
we
know
truly
that
we
yet
to
live
and
to
be
indeed
with
the
beloved
and
i
then
alway
to
make
the
diskos
spin
a
little
yet
something
more
than
when
i
should
see
the
hour
and
in
verity
our
faces
then
to
show
pale
and
strange
seeming
in
that
luminous
glowing
of
the
great
weapon
in
the
darkness
and
we
to
look
very
eager
and
an
hungered
of
love
each
at
the
other
and
so
to
need
that
we
be
held
loving
by
the
beloved
and
so
to
have
comfort
and
assuredness
and
afterward
to
have
peace
to
go
onward
again
and
it
did
be
one
such
time
as
these
that
mine
own
to
give
me
a
love
name
she
had
called
me
in
those
olden
days
of
this
age
and
which
surely
i
had
not
heard
since
mirdath
died
and
in
verity
you
to
have
dear
understanding
with
me
how
that
i
then
to
be
all
troubled
with
vague
troubles
and
ghostly
loveaches
in
the
heart
and
likewise
i
did
be
all
set
about
in
a
moment
by
the
olden
enchantment
and
speechless
glamour
that
did
be
so
long
hid
and
lost
in
the
spaces
of
memory
where
surely
the
spirit
doth
wander
such
oddwhiles
husht
unto
a
dumb
tearlessness
and
to
know
in
the
same
moment
both
agony
and
the
voiceless
glory
and
lost
delight
of
the
hathbeen
so
that
it
doth
be
as
that
you
wandered
in
the
spirit
between
the
sorrowful
pain
of
the
sunset
and
the
promise
of
the
dawn
which
doth
be
builded
upon
the
need
and
hope
of
the
soul
and
doth
also
to
have
an
essence
of
pain
within
it
because
that
these
do
be
knit
with
longing
which
doth
be
the
essential
pang
of
memory
and
so
mayhap
you
to
have
gone
with
me
for
you
to
have
also
strange
thoughts
that
do
come
out
of
the
years
and
do
hurt
the
heart
even
whilst
that
the
heart
doth
hunger
of
that
which
doth
so
pain
yet
truly
mine
own
did
be
now
with
me
as
you
do
know
so
that
i
had
joy
all
about
my
heart
yet
did
all
the
years
of
my
lost
delights
and
of
my
pain
be
in
the
spaces
of
my
memory
and
mine
own
now
to
have
stirred
all
so
that
no
words
that
did
be
ever
shaped
of
man
should
help
me
to
have
ease
in
speech
and
mine
own
maid
to
know
how
it
did
be
with
me
and
she
to
have
said
the
thing
scarce
wotting
even
as
her
spirit
did
set
it
through
her
lips
and
she
before
then
to
have
forgot
so
utter
as
i
and
now
she
to
be
stirred
likewise
with
me
so
that
in
verity
we
to
hold
hands
in
the
great
darkness
upon
the
slope
and
to
wait
till
the
pain
and
strange
trouble
did
go
somewhat
from
our
hearts
and
we
to
have
power
again
to
know
truly
that
we
did
be
again
together
in
sweet
verity
after
a
mighty
eternity
and
thus
did
we
go
and
even
in
that
strange
night
to
have
an
everlasting
coming
together
so
that
surely
our
two
spirits
to
be
nigh
made
one
somewise
and
this
to
be
that
sweet
and
holy
thing
which
i
do
name
love
and
it
to
be
my
glory
and
astonishment
that
love
hath
come
unto
me
and
with
you
that
have
love
i
am
as
a
brother
in
holy
delight
but
with
all
that
have
not
known
love
or
to
have
missed
love
i
am
a
mourner
and
my
heart
to
pray
that
they
to
know
this
wonder
ere
they
die
for
else
shall
they
die
so
green
and
bitter
as
they
be
born
and
to
have
grown
nowise
unto
ripeness
which
doth
be
charitythe
end
of
life
and
the
crown
of
humanity
and
surely
i
to
go
forward
again
now
with
my
telling
and
you
to
know
that
on
the
eighth
day
upon
the
slope
about
the
end
of
the
ninth
hour
there
to
be
an
upward
seeming
of
light
afar
before
us
in
the
darkness
and
did
show
as
a
dull
and
vague
sheen
above
us
in
the
night
and
truly
i
to
know
that
we
did
be
come
at
last
anear
unto
the
night
land
and
we
went
upward
then
very
eager
through
the
dark
and
the
dim
shine
did
grow
ever
so
that
we
soon
to
see
it
very
plain
as
a
looming
of
light
afar
upward
and
we
ever
to
climb
and
to
go
onward
and
lo
in
the
fourteenth
hour
of
that
day
we
came
up
slowly
out
of
the
night
upon
the
slope
and
stood
at
the
ending
of
that
strange
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
and
surely
it
did
be
as
that
i
was
come
home
and
to
have
set
my
feet
again
upon
familiar
lands
and
this
to
bring
to
you
how
far
off
i
did
seem
to
have
gone
and
now
to
be
come
again
to
a
known
place
and
we
went
upward
upon
the
road
until
that
we
did
truly
have
topt
the
slope
and
at
last
to
look
out
over
all
the
wonder
and
mystery
of
that
land
and
i
never
to
be
rid
of
the
utter
gladness
of
knowing
that
i
was
come
there
again
after
so
strange
a
journey
and
that
mine
own
had
i
brought
with
me
out
of
all
the
unknown
world
yet
truly
i
also
never
to
have
forgetting
that
this
familiar
land
of
strangeness
did
be
the
last
test
and
the
greatest
dreadfulness
of
our
journey
and
anxiousness
did
hang
upon
me
for
i
now
to
have
to
take
the
preciousness
of
mine
own
among
and
beyond
all
that
danger
of
horrid
forces
and
of
monstrous
things
and
beast
men
and
the
like
and
truly
i
did
be
like
to
trouble
and
in
verity
i
did
stare
with
a
fierce
eagerness
unto
the
faroff
place
in
the
middle
part
of
the
night
land
where
did
be
the
mighty
pyramid
and
surely
it
there
to
shine
in
the
midst
of
the
land
and
did
be
mine
home
where
never
had
i
dared
hope
i
should
return
and
i
set
mine
arm
very
swift
and
eager
about
the
maid
and
pointed
so
that
she
see
quickly
the
wonder
and
safe
mightiness
of
that
which
did
be
our
refuge
for
all
our
life
to
come
if
but
that
we
to
win
unto
it
and
the
maid
to
look
with
a
great
and
earnest
soberness
and
a
lovely
gladness
and
utter
soul
and
heart
interest
unto
that
place
that
bare
me
and
where
i
to
have
come
from
and
now
to
take
her
and
long
and
long
she
lookt
and
sudden
came
round
unto
me
and
set
her
arms
quick
about
my
neck
and
burst
unto
a
strange
and
happy
weeping
and
i
to
hold
her
gentle
to
me
and
let
her
cry
very
natural
until
that
she
was
something
unpent
and
lo
when
that
she
was
eased
she
to
stand
close
beside
me
and
to
look
again
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
and
afterward
as
she
to
steady
she
to
ask
an
hundred
questions
so
utter
eager
and
so
to
thrill
with
joy
and
excitement
as
that
she
did
be
a
glad
child
and
an
hundred
questions
i
answered
and
showed
her
new
things
and
wonders
uncounted
and
of
all
strangeness
that
she
then
to
see
there
did
none
so
to
shake
her
in
the
spirit
with
terror
as
did
that
dreadful
and
horrid
house
which
did
be
the
house
of
silence
and
it
was
as
that
her
very
being
did
know
and
be
repulsed
of
some
horror
that
did
concern
and
be
in
that
house
so
that
she
to
want
to
hide
in
the
bushes
that
did
be
anigh
to
the
road
and
truly
i
to
think
this
wise
and
to
remember
and
to
be
ware
suddenly
that
we
did
be
indeed
come
now
into
the
power
of
monstrosity
which
did
be
utter
and
forever
abroad
in
that
land
and
surely
we
went
then
in
among
the
bushes
that
did
grow
clumpt
upon
the
side
of
the
road
as
you
to
remember
and
afterward
i
calmed
this
new
fear
that
had
come
so
quick
upon
mine
own
and
she
then
to
peer
forth
with
me
from
the
bushes
and
to
have
renewed
sight
over
the
land
and
the
house
of
silence
to
stand
upon
that
low
hill
of
which
you
do
know
and
did
not
be
a
very
great
way
off
somewise
toward
the
right
yet
as
you
shall
have
remembering
it
did
take
me
some
long
and
bitter
hours
upon
mine
outward
way
ere
i
did
be
come
from
under
the
shadow
of
it
as
we
do
say
unto
the
toppart
of
the
mighty
slope
but
this
to
have
been
in
the
main
because
of
the
utter
care
that
i
did
need
to
bring
me
safe
past
the
house
for
i
to
have
gone
long
and
weary
upon
my
hands
and
knees
among
the
bushes
as
you
remember
and
oft
to
pause
and
to
be
so
still
as
death
lest
that
the
power
of
the
house
to
have
become
aware
of
my
passing
and
truly
we
to
need
again
so
utter
a
care
when
that
we
make
to
go
past
unto
our
mighty
home
and
this
to
be
heavy
upon
my
heart
and
i
to
be
in
the
same
moment
anxious
that
we
have
haste
to
the
trial
and
yet
very
willing
if
it
might
be
that
we
not
make
it
forever
and
indeed
after
that
we
had
peered
a
good
while
from
the
bushes
i
to
consider
that
we
do
well
to
eat
now
and
afterward
to
have
a
safe
place
for
our
slumber
so
that
we
go
fresh
to
the
horrid
dangers
and
dreadfulness
that
did
be
before
us
upon
our
way
and
we
then
to
look
about
and
soon
to
find
a
great
boulder
that
did
be
set
with
the
bushes
and
we
made
our
place
for
sleep
against
the
boulder
and
the
bushes
went
all
around
so
that
we
did
be
complete
hid
and
in
verity
we
to
be
very
cold
as
we
had
been
those
two
past
days
whilst
that
we
made
toward
the
top
of
the
mighty
slope
and
now
we
to
have
the
full
chill
of
the
night
land
and
did
be
very
glad
to
have
the
cloak
so
that
we
eat
and
drank
whilst
that
we
sat
together
and
the
cloak
round
us
and
afterward
the
maid
set
the
cloak
about
us
for
our
sleep
and
we
then
to
kiss
very
sober
and
i
with
anxiousness
in
the
heart
but
she
with
less
because
she
to
have
rest
in
me
and
so
we
lay
down
to
our
sleep
and
the
diskos
ready
in
my
hand
and
my
spirit
wakeful
against
any
terror
that
should
come
anigh
to
us
in
our
slumber
and
the
maid
i
warned
to
be
likewise
wary
and
surely
we
slept
and
waked
and
there
had
gone
eight
good
hours
and
naught
was
come
anigh
to
us
to
harm
us
and
we
eat
and
drank
and
did
hark
oft
and
lookt
out
from
among
the
bushes
but
there
did
be
naught
abroad
to
set
dread
upon
our
spirits
and
so
we
did
be
more
content
and
well
rest
and
aready
for
the
further
journeying
now
i
had
the
maid
to
wear
the
cloak
because
of
the
chill
of
the
land
but
she
in
the
first
to
refuse
save
i
also
to
have
it
in
my
turn
but
truly
i
did
feel
that
it
should
smother
me
and
that
i
need
all
my
freedom
of
my
body
lest
there
come
any
thing
sudden
upon
us
and
all
this
i
showed
mine
own
and
also
that
we
should
have
weary
work
and
to
creep
much
so
that
i
should
be
warm
by
my
labour
of
going
and
she
likewise
mayhap
and
she
then
to
consent
because
she
saw
that
i
did
be
earnest
and
to
burn
with
anxiousness
yet
had
me
to
promise
that
i
take
the
cloak
if
that
the
chill
of
the
land
gat
me
anywise
bitter
now
we
made
a
pause
when
that
we
have
our
gear
upon
us
and
we
lookt
well
out
over
the
land
and
surely
alway
our
eyes
did
gaze
in
the
ending
upon
that
far
wonder
of
light
and
safeness
which
did
be
the
mighty
pyramid
and
i
to
be
never
ceased
from
telling
mine
own
this
thing
and
that
thing
concerning
the
great
refuge
and
she
to
be
constant
stunned
unto
silence
and
delight
of
wonder
and
anon
shaken
unto
a
multitude
of
questionings
so
that
truly
we
did
be
as
that
we
never
to
have
done
making
known
one
unto
the
other
now
as
you
have
knowledge
the
house
of
silence
stood
upon
a
low
hill
and
the
road
did
bend
about
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
this
way
did
i
come
when
that
i
was
on
mine
outward
way
yet
now
there
to
be
a
new
plan
of
journeying
come
into
my
mind
for
as
you
do
remember
i
did
take
somewise
of
eleven
great
days
from
the
pyramid
unto
the
toppart
of
the
mighty
slope
because
that
i
had
gone
diversely
and
round
about
to
the
northwest
of
the
plain
of
blue
fire
and
surely
as
now
i
lookt
it
did
seem
that
we
should
try
a
short
passage
and
thereby
be
come
free
out
of
all
danger
in
but
a
space
of
four
or
five
days
if
only
we
to
succeed
and
i
stood
a
good
while
very
husht
and
anxious
and
did
consider
this
new
way
and
did
presently
point
it
out
to
the
maid
how
that
we
saw
the
mighty
redoubt
straight
to
the
back
of
the
low
hill
where
stood
the
house
of
silence
and
mayhap
we
might
chance
to
find
a
safe
going
that
way
and
that
i
did
ponder
thatwise
for
indeed
as
you
do
know
we
must
go
nigh
past
the
house
even
did
we
return
by
the
long
journeying
and
this
to
be
because
that
the
bushes
did
make
a
cover
only
near
to
the
road
and
all
to
be
a
country
of
bare
rock
beyond
the
bushes
on
that
side
of
the
road
which
did
be
to
the
north
and
west
now
presently
i
had
formed
my
intention
regarding
our
way
and
told
all
to
mine
own
and
how
that
we
to
have
alway
an
utter
caution
and
the
danger
i
made
so
plain
to
her
as
i
did
know
it
and
she
then
to
beware
in
her
heart
the
need
there
to
be
of
care
and
wiseness
forever
as
we
did
go
and
we
then
to
make
forward
into
the
night
land
and
to
be
gone
from
the
toppart
of
that
great
deep
in
which
there
to
be
hid
strange
lands
as
you
do
know
and
surely
it
to
be
like
that
none
should
ever
to
go
that
way
again
for
an
eternity
or
maybe
forever
and
so
went
we
forward
with
a
new
caution
and
we
came
out
from
among
the
bushes
upon
the
northwest
of
the
road
and
crost
unto
the
eastward
side
and
here
the
bushes
to
grow
very
plentiful
so
that
i
led
on
with
a
cheerfulness
of
hope
within
my
heart
and
alway
i
went
so
far
to
the
southeast
as
the
bushes
would
give
us
their
cover
and
this
way
i
made
that
we
should
scarce
to
pass
within
a
great
mile
of
the
dread
and
horrid
house
though
in
verity
this
to
be
most
dreadful
close
and
we
walked
then
for
six
hours
and
went
sometimes
creeping
and
oft
stoopt
and
ever
with
a
great
caution
and
in
the
sixth
hour
we
made
a
rest
and
eat
and
drank
and
afterward
went
forward
again
and
in
the
tenth
hour
were
we
come
something
nigh
unto
the
house
for
truly
we
to
be
off
from
the
road
where
the
silent
ones
walk
and
so
to
go
more
straightly
and
alway
to
save
distance
and
we
kept
so
far
outward
from
the
house
as
we
might
but
could
pass
it
not
more
than
a
great
mile
off
because
that
the
bushes
did
have
their
margin
near
upon
our
left
as
we
went
and
there
to
be
barenness
of
rock
beyond
and
fireholes
in
this
part
and
that
amid
the
starkness
of
the
rocky
spaces
that
should
be
like
to
show
us
very
plain
if
that
we
came
outward
from
the
bushes
and
moreover
there
went
upward
into
the
everlasting
night
one
of
those
towers
of
silence
which
did
be
in
this
part
and
that
part
of
the
land
and
were
thought
to
hold
strange
watchers
and
the
tower
stood
great
and
monstrous
afar
off
in
the
midst
of
the
naked
rocks
showing
very
grey
and
dim
save
when
the
flare
of
some
great
fire
did
beat
upward
in
the
land
and
sent
huge
and
monstrous
lights
upon
it
and
we
to
have
need
alway
now
to
remember
this
tower
and
to
keep
the
more
so
to
the
sheltered
hiding
of
the
bushes
yet
in
verity
we
to
have
little
thought
of
aught
save
of
the
grim
and
threatening
terror
and
monstrousness
which
did
stand
forever
upon
that
low
hill
and
did
be
the
house
of
silence
and
in
the
eleventh
hour
we
did
go
creeping
from
bush
unto
bush
and
did
be
as
shadows
that
went
in
the
mixt
greyness
and
odd
shinings
of
that
land
and
the
grim
and
dreadful
house
did
be
now
unto
our
right
and
did
loom
huge
and
utter
silent
above
us
in
the
night
and
the
lights
of
the
house
did
shine
steadfast
and
deathless
with
a
noiseless
shining
as
that
they
shone
out
of
the
quiet
of
some
drear
and
unnatural
eternity
and
there
did
a
seeming
of
unholiness
to
brood
in
the
air
and
a
sense
of
all
and
deathly
knowledge
so
that
surely
our
hiding
did
seem
but
a
futile
thing
unto
our
spirits
for
it
was
to
us
as
that
we
did
be
watched
quiet
and
alway
by
a
power
as
we
slipt
gentle
from
bush
unto
bush
and
when
the
twelfth
hour
did
be
nigh
we
to
begin
to
draw
clear
of
the
house
and
surely
there
to
come
somewhat
of
ease
into
my
brain
and
heart
for
it
did
be
as
that
we
should
come
clear
of
all
harm
and
i
turned
to
the
maid
that
i
whisper
gentle
and
loving
encouragement
unto
her
and
lo
in
that
moment
mine
own
gave
out
a
sudden
low
sobbing
and
was
gone
still
upon
the
earth
and
truly
my
heart
did
seem
to
die
in
me
for
i
knew
that
there
did
be
directed
a
force
out
of
the
house
of
silence
which
did
be
aimed
unto
the
spirit
of
mine
own
maid
and
i
caught
the
maid
instant
into
mine
arms
and
i
set
my
body
between
her
body
and
the
dreadness
of
the
house
and
surely
my
spirit
to
perceive
that
there
beat
out
at
her
a
dreadful
force
which
did
have
in
it
an
utter
silence
and
a
bleakness
of
desolation
and
lo
i
saw
in
a
moment
that
the
force
had
no
power
to
slay
me
but
did
surely
make
to
slay
the
maid
and
i
set
my
spirit
and
my
will
about
her
for
a
shield
if
this
might
be
and
i
had
her
to
mine
arms
as
that
she
did
be
mine
own
babe
and
i
stood
upright
for
there
did
be
no
more
use
to
hide
and
i
knew
that
i
must
walk
forever
until
that
i
have
mine
own
to
the
shelter
of
the
mighty
refuge
or
to
walk
until
i
die
for
only
with
speed
might
i
save
her
from
the
dread
and
horrid
malice
of
that
force
and
i
set
free
the
diskos
from
my
hip
and
had
it
in
mine
arms
beside
the
maid
and
i
strode
forward
out
of
the
bushes
and
put
forth
my
strength
that
i
journey
with
an
utter
speed
and
ever
my
spirit
did
know
of
that
monstrous
force
which
did
be
direct
upon
us
to
the
destruction
of
mine
own
maid
and
odd
whiles
as
i
walkt
i
called
mine
own
by
her
olden
love
name
and
by
the
new
name
of
naani
but
never
did
she
move
or
seem
even
that
she
lived
and
surely
my
heart
sickened
within
me
with
a
mighty
despair
so
that
a
constant
madness
did
begin
to
thrill
in
me
and
to
make
me
something
monstrous
in
strength
with
my
fierce
agony
and
intentness
to
save
and
one
hope
only
had
i
that
i
bring
her
yet
living
into
the
shelter
of
the
mighty
refuge
and
so
swift
to
the
care
of
the
doctors
and
lo
i
did
strive
to
be
wise
in
my
despair
for
i
made
a
quick
halting
soon
and
i
warmed
a
broth
of
the
tablets
and
water
upon
a
hot
rock
and
strove
that
i
set
some
of
the
broth
between
the
closed
lips
of
mine
own
maid
yet
did
it
be
useless
as
i
to
have
known
before
in
my
heart
and
alway
i
kept
my
body
and
my
will
and
my
spirit
and
my
love
between
the
maid
and
the
dreadfulness
of
the
house
and
i
made
some
of
the
water
and
dasht
it
upon
the
face
of
mine
own
and
i
chafed
her
hands
but
truly
it
to
have
no
use
neither
did
i
truly
to
think
it
should
be
like
to
and
i
wiped
her
face
then
and
harked
to
her
dear
heart
and
surely
it
did
beat
very
slow
and
husht
and
afterward
i
wrapt
her
in
the
cloak
and
i
forced
myself
then
that
i
eat
some
of
the
tablets
and
i
drank
a
great
lot
of
the
water
for
a
fever
did
seem
to
burn
in
me
and
moreover
i
to
mean
that
i
lack
not
for
strength
to
my
task
and
i
set
my
gear
upon
me
very
speedy
and
i
lifted
mine
own
beloved
that
did
be
now
so
husht
that
once
had
been
so
merry
and
dearly
naughty
and
surely
i
nigh
choked
as
the
thought
uprase
in
me
but
i
set
it
back
and
did
but
go
the
more
furious
and
surely
no
man
did
ever
go
so
fast
and
constant
upon
his
feet
through
an
eternity
for
i
was
come
again
to
my
strength
and
there
did
be
a
madness
of
intention
and
despair
upon
me
and
i
went
on
forever
and
at
each
sixth
hour
when
i
stopt
very
brief
to
eat
and
to
drink
i
made
to
bring
mine
own
to
her
senses
yet
she
never
to
come
and
alway
her
heart
to
grow
the
more
feeble
so
that
in
the
end
i
did
utter
fear
to
hark
and
did
but
set
food
and
drink
into
me
and
onward
again
with
an
utter
fierceness
and
why
there
came
not
any
sweet
power
of
goodness
to
help
me
in
my
strait
i
never
to
know
but
did
call
desperate
upon
all
good
things
to
aid
me
as
i
went
to
save
mine
own
but
there
naught
to
come
so
that
i
had
grown
into
cursings
but
that
i
did
not
to
lose
my
wisdom
to
any
useless
foolishness
and
alway
as
i
went
i
to
see
the
land
blindly
and
oft
vague
and
grey
as
that
i
did
look
at
naught
real
and
again
with
strange
flashings
of
light
and
the
glare
of
fires
and
anon
to
see
the
land
as
it
did
be
and
all
odd
whiles
to
have
now
to
me
the
feel
of
a
dread
and
monstrous
dreaming
and
surely
i
sped
forever
through
the
dreadful
hours
and
went
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
neither
did
i
strive
to
hide
in
the
bushes
nor
to
evade
aught
for
i
knew
that
the
maid
died
slowly
in
mine
arms
and
there
to
be
no
more
gain
in
life
save
by
speed
that
i
have
her
swift
to
the
mighty
pyramid
to
the
care
of
the
doctors
and
a
great
and
despairing
madness
grew
ever
within
me
and
thrice
i
to
have
a
vague
memory
that
there
came
creatures
at
me
from
the
dark
of
the
land
but
surely
i
slew
them
with
the
diskos
and
have
no
remembering
thereof
only
that
mine
anger
did
boil
in
me
and
i
to
know
once
that
the
diskos
did
run
blood
in
my
hand
and
lo
there
to
come
sudden
unto
my
spirit
the
knowledge
that
the
aether
of
the
world
did
be
stirred
and
indeed
i
did
be
surely
sighted
by
the
great
millions
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
they
to
have
seen
me
come
forward
into
the
sight
of
the
spyglasses
and
that
i
did
bring
a
maid
in
mine
arms
out
of
all
the
night
of
the
world
and
truly
as
i
did
after
learn
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
had
discovered
me
great
hours
before
for
there
had
been
a
steadfast
watch
kept
in
the
tower
of
observation
for
my
returning
if
that
ever
i
should
return
and
the
might
of
the
great
spyglass
had
shown
me
plain
a
good
while
gone
and
that
i
did
carry
somewhat
that
was
surely
the
maid
that
i
did
go
to
find
yet
had
the
master
given
an
order
that
no
word
be
set
abroad
to
the
peoples
of
this
discovering
lest
that
the
emotions
of
the
millions
to
tell
overmuch
unto
the
evil
powers
of
the
land
but
now
had
the
millions
also
come
unto
knowledge
for
many
had
ceased
not
to
watch
through
their
spyglasses
and
the
news
to
travel
very
speedy
through
the
cities
and
surely
now
there
did
be
a
constant
spiritual
noise
in
the
night
to
be
heard
only
of
the
spirit
yet
to
suffice
to
wake
and
to
warn
all
that
land
and
truly
as
i
after
to
learn
the
master
monstruwacan
did
know
by
the
instruments
that
there
came
a
force
out
of
the
house
of
silence
and
this
to
trouble
him
greatly
so
that
he
set
the
word
through
the
pyramid
by
the
hourslips
that
all
the
peoples
strive
to
contain
their
emotion
lest
they
bring
an
harm
and
a
destruction
upon
me
by
warning
the
land
with
the
greatness
of
their
feelings
yet
in
verily
this
did
be
useless
for
the
peoples
did
be
very
human
and
could
nowise
check
their
gladness
and
great
wonder
and
excitement
for
it
was
to
them
so
great
a
wonder
almost
as
we
should
suffer
if
that
a
man
in
this
age
should
go
beyond
death
in
search
of
his
beloved
and
afterward
to
come
backward
unto
the
living
and
surely
in
such
case
how
mighty
should
be
our
amazement
and
this
to
be
somewise
how
they
did
be
yet
with
it
also
a
sweet
and
natural
gladness
and
strong
welcoming
which
doth
be
the
true
beat
of
the
human
heart
unto
the
wanderer
and
presently
and
through
all
the
time
that
i
came
forward
across
the
land
there
did
be
mayhaps
an
hundred
million
that
did
never
cease
to
watch
me
from
the
embrasures
from
the
viewtables
and
from
all
vantages
yet
for
a
long
while
only
they
which
possessed
strong
spyingglasses
did
be
abled
to
see
me
truly
for
i
was
a
great
way
off
and
millions
did
but
stare
vainly
unto
that
part
where
i
was
said
to
be
and
the
hourslips
to
come
out
four
times
in
the
hour
and
to
tell
aught
that
did
be
known
and
so
shall
you
perceive
that
humanity
did
but
have
grown
the
more
human
and
in
verity
i
went
forward
with
all
my
strength
and
did
drive
heedless
through
the
miles
and
the
night
and
scarce
conscious
of
aught
because
of
the
aching
madness
of
despair
that
did
grow
ever
within
me
for
i
knew
that
mine
own
maid
died
alway
in
mine
arms
as
i
did
carry
her
and
later
a
monstrous
space
of
hours
it
to
seem
i
knew
that
i
was
come
to
that
part
of
the
road
where
it
did
bend
somewhat
unto
the
vale
of
red
fire
and
this
did
be
something
anigh
to
that
wilderness
where
the
youths
did
fight
with
the
giantmen
and
i
came
over
the
road
and
urged
my
body
utter
furious
across
the
land
and
surely
in
that
moment
when
i
cross
the
road
great
numbers
of
the
millions
did
see
me
that
had
not
seen
before
and
there
went
a
shaking
in
the
aether
of
the
world
because
of
the
sudden
emotion
of
so
mighty
a
multitude
and
lo
it
did
be
as
that
in
that
moment
the
land
was
at
last
waked
for
there
came
from
far
away
unto
the
eastward
a
faint
and
dreadful
laughter
as
that
a
monstrous
being
laught
unto
itself
in
some
lost
and
dreadful
country
and
the
laughter
passed
over
the
land
and
did
echo
strangely
as
it
did
seem
in
this
part
and
that
part
and
presently
to
go
rolling
round
in
the
far
and
hid
west
lands
and
to
be
as
that
it
wandered
awhile
amid
the
far
mountains
of
the
outer
lands
and
was
presently
lost
from
my
hearing
and
my
heart
chilled
a
little
maybe
but
yet
did
i
not
care
overmuch
for
i
to
lack
all
if
that
i
lackt
death
if
that
i
not
to
be
given
power
to
save
mine
own
yet
did
i
make
a
little
pause
so
that
i
gat
the
knife
from
the
belt
of
the
maid
and
did
also
to
bare
the
capsule
for
if
that
there
came
a
destruction
upon
us
i
to
make
instant
sure
that
mine
own
maid
be
safe
unto
death
and
i
then
to
go
quickly
with
the
capsule
and
afterward
i
again
upon
my
way
and
ever
upon
each
sixth
hour
i
did
stop
that
i
eat
and
drink
and
did
onward
again
even
as
a
machine
for
i
commanded
myself
to
this
duty
of
victual
that
i
lack
not
my
strength
unto
the
saving
of
the
maid
yet
truly
i
did
seem
to
choke
alway
as
i
strove
with
the
tablets
and
lo
ever
as
i
went
forward
did
the
land
awake
and
my
spirit
to
know
that
great
forces
did
be
abroad
restless
and
the
monsters
to
begin
wild
roamings
because
that
they
also
to
know
of
the
unrest
that
did
be
come
into
the
land
and
there
to
go
presently
odd
roarings
across
the
land
from
night
unto
night
and
i
to
go
forward
the
more
desperate
and
to
step
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
to
make
direct
unto
my
mighty
home
and
the
vale
of
red
fire
did
be
soon
afar
off
unto
my
right
and
the
bulk
of
the
watcher
of
the
northeast
to
be
somewise
unto
my
left
before
me
and
the
great
back
to
be
toward
me
and
truly
i
lookt
at
the
bruteforce
and
it
did
be
as
that
i
drew
nigh
unto
a
mountain
of
watchfulness
and
above
it
in
the
everlasting
night
did
be
the
blue
shining
of
the
luminous
ring
and
the
ring
shed
a
light
downward
over
the
monsterforce
and
the
shoulders
did
be
huge
and
humpt
even
as
two
small
hills
and
it
lookt
forever
from
me
through
eternity
unto
the
pyramid
and
this
to
be
plain
though
i
did
be
a
great
way
off
from
it
and
sudden
as
i
went
there
came
somewhat
out
of
a
bush
unto
my
left
and
rose
up
at
me
very
long
and
tall
and
surely
it
did
be
some
kind
of
a
man
and
came
at
me
and
my
fury
and
my
despair
came
inward
upon
me
in
a
moment
so
that
i
troubled
not
to
set
down
the
maid
but
leaped
at
the
thing
where
it
did
be
yet
half
hid
in
the
dark
and
lo
it
died
in
pieces
and
the
diskos
did
roar
to
content
my
heart
an
instant
and
i
then
onward
again
the
more
savage
so
that
my
heart
did
be
a
dreadful
thing
within
me
and
a
great
while
i
went
then
and
do
have
a
vague
remembering
that
this
time
and
that
there
came
things
at
me
from
out
of
the
dark
but
surely
they
to
have
died
very
speedy
that
i
not
to
remember
more
and
the
hours
did
pass
in
spaces
of
time
that
did
be
made
of
terror
and
numbness
and
an
utter
and
evergrowing
fury
of
despair
and
i
did
be
at
last
as
that
i
did
burn
inward
with
a
grim
and
dreadful
energy
and
to
seem
to
grow
the
less
tired
and
to
come
over
the
land
with
a
stronger
ease
and
somewhat
as
that
i
did
desire
things
to
come
unto
me
that
i
have
something
to
ease
my
heart
for
lo
mine
own
maid
did
be
dying
in
mine
arms
as
i
carried
her
and
i
to
be
in
a
bleak
and
sickened
dread
so
that
i
lacked
all
courage
now
to
listen
unto
her
heart
as
i
have
told
and
went
burning
and
dry
and
hot
in
the
eyes
and
ever
there
sounded
the
roarings
across
the
land
and
there
did
be
added
presently
lower
and
more
horrid
and
dread
noises
and
later
i
heard
a
far
thudding
of
the
earth
and
in
a
little
there
went
past
me
a
great
man
running
so
heavy
that
he
did
make
a
shaking
as
he
past
me
yet
in
verity
by
a
sweet
mercy
he
saw
me
not
and
was
gone
onward
in
a
moment
and
lost
utter
into
the
night
and
the
aether
of
the
world
to
be
full
of
the
trouble
of
the
peoples
as
the
man
past
me
and
afterward
there
to
be
a
stirring
of
glad
thankfulness
and
truly
alway
my
spirit
did
know
strangely
as
in
a
dream
that
the
millions
set
their
sympathy
and
pity
and
help
about
me
and
did
girt
me
about
with
human
love
and
with
encouragement
and
with
uplifted
thoughts
yet
in
verity
did
all
be
as
water
beside
the
fierce
wine
of
my
love
and
despair
which
did
urge
me
onward
in
a
natural
lacking
of
all
dread
save
for
mine
own
and
truly
this
doth
be
the
way
of
love
and
shall
make
fearless
the
heart
of
the
weakest
and
there
to
be
prayers
in
the
night
and
all
the
aether
to
be
surged
with
the
spiritual
trouble
and
callings
and
cryings
of
the
millions
so
that
indeed
if
that
my
spirit
so
to
hear
these
things
it
to
be
conceived
that
these
do
pass
outward
into
the
everlasting
and
to
break
upon
the
shore
of
eternity
in
an
anguish
even
as
a
visible
foam
of
supplication
and
surely
the
unity
of
love
of
the
millions
did
make
a
natural
force
about
me
for
in
verity
the
force
that
did
come
from
the
house
to
seem
to
be
somewhat
eased
from
the
maid
yet
there
to
be
no
surety
in
this
for
all
did
be
desperation
and
turmoil
in
my
heart
and
i
to
have
but
one
thought
in
my
brain
that
i
bring
mine
own
swift
across
the
land
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
and
so
unto
the
doctors
and
lo
there
stole
presently
from
afar
the
deep
and
dreadful
baying
of
the
hounds
so
that
i
knew
we
did
be
surely
dead
save
that
a
miracle
should
happen
and
i
askt
in
my
heart
in
a
fierce
and
mad
fashion
why
that
they
did
not
to
rig
one
of
the
olden
shooting
weapons
that
they
shoot
from
the
pyramid
and
so
to
give
me
some
aid
in
mine
extremity
and
behold
even
as
i
did
be
so
bitter
there
went
afar
upward
in
the
everlasting
night
where
did
shine
the
last
light
the
sharp
flashings
of
the
set
speech
and
i
did
warm
in
my
heart
a
little
with
hope
for
the
master
monstruwacan
did
see
that
i
was
now
all
discovered
and
there
to
be
no
more
use
for
silence
and
did
speak
straight
and
helpful
unto
me
and
i
made
to
read
the
set
speech
but
mine
eyes
had
been
mad
and
near
blinded
with
lost
hope
but
in
a
moment
i
saw
clear
and
behold
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
bid
me
to
keep
good
my
courage
for
that
they
did
have
made
ready
three
of
the
olden
weapons
and
moreover
they
to
save
me
even
if
that
they
have
to
turn
loose
the
earthcurrent
over
the
land
and
he
commended
me
with
honour
and
that
i
strive
forward
yet
a
little
while
for
that
an
hundred
thousand
men
did
be
prepared
and
did
even
then
go
downward
in
their
armour
by
the
lifts
and
surely
as
you
shall
think
my
heart
eased
a
little
in
me
and
there
burned
somewhat
of
a
hope
in
my
spirit
that
i
yet
to
bring
mine
own
unto
the
doctors
ere
it
be
too
late
and
the
baying
of
the
hounds
did
grow
nearer
in
the
night
and
there
to
grow
ever
the
roarings
over
the
land
and
a
sense
of
evil
and
monstrousness
to
be
abroad
in
all
the
night
and
lo
i
to
have
come
by
this
so
that
the
watcher
of
the
northeast
did
be
backward
upon
my
left
and
i
lookt
keen
and
fearful
now
at
the
monsterforce
and
behold
the
great
bellear
did
quiver
continually
so
that
i
saw
the
monster
made
somewhat
known
unto
all
the
land
and
the
monster
did
look
as
ever
unto
the
pyramid
and
did
be
a
great
and
silent
hill
of
life
that
did
lean
toward
the
pyramid
and
the
light
from
the
ring
came
downward
upon
the
monstrous
hide
which
did
be
set
in
vast
folds
and
wrinkles
upon
it
and
the
monster
to
know
of
me
yet
never
to
move
neither
to
show
life
save
that
the
ear
did
quiver
so
horridly
and
i
knew
that
they
made
some
great
preparation
in
the
pyramid
for
our
defence
for
all
the
night
did
begin
now
to
shake
and
to
quiver
with
the
mighty
beat
of
the
earthcurrent
xvi
in
the
country
of
silence
and
lo
i
did
be
come
something
nigh
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
and
my
great
home
went
up
vast
into
the
everlasting
night
as
a
very
mountain
of
sweet
life
and
safety
and
had
surely
amazed
me
afresh
with
the
utter
bigness
of
it
only
that
despair
and
weariness
did
have
too
grim
an
hold
upon
my
heart
for
me
to
care
of
aught
save
to
have
mine
own
maid
within
the
safe
wonder
of
the
huge
refuge
and
it
did
be
still
afar
off
from
me
and
i
to
go
forward
across
the
land
with
a
strong
going
and
lo
as
i
past
a
hollow
place
where
did
burn
a
firehole
there
came
something
out
of
the
hollow
and
the
thing
gat
upward
from
crawling
and
did
be
a
great
and
haired
man
and
the
man
lookt
at
me
and
afterward
came
unto
me
and
did
put
his
hands
forward
very
eager
as
he
came
and
i
did
see
the
hands
plain
in
the
light
from
the
firehole
and
the
hands
were
monstrous
and
did
be
armed
brutish
with
horrid
claws
so
that
the
man
should
have
been
able
to
rip
aught
even
as
a
wild
beast
and
i
put
mine
own
very
swift
to
the
earth
and
surely
i
cared
not
for
life
or
aught
for
this
thing
did
make
to
delay
me
and
i
to
be
fierce
with
despair
that
aught
should
halt
me
and
lo
i
leaped
very
furious
and
with
cold
anger
at
the
giant
and
i
smote
at
the
monstrous
brute
but
he
unto
the
side
in
an
instant
of
time
and
so
escaped
the
blow
and
he
flung
forth
his
monstrous
arm
out
of
the
halfdark
of
a
shadow
that
did
be
cast
by
the
dance
of
the
firehole
and
caught
my
headpiece
and
pluckt
it
from
me
so
strong
and
brutish
that
he
cast
me
nigh
a
dozen
feet
on
to
my
back
yet
i
was
not
harmed
in
the
life
but
only
sore
shaked
and
bruised
and
i
to
be
up
in
a
moment
and
came
in
upon
the
giant
and
the
diskos
did
roar
and
blaze
in
my
hands
as
i
swung
the
weapon
and
i
gat
the
giant
above
the
middle
part
and
the
diskos
did
glut
itself
and
went
through
the
giant
as
that
he
did
be
naught
though
so
huge
and
monstrous
and
girt
with
strength
and
he
to
have
surely
turned
his
shoulders
as
he
died
for
the
upper
part
of
the
giantman
went
horrid
to
the
earth
and
the
legs
and
the
trunk
stood
plain
in
the
light
of
the
firehole
and
the
blood
went
upward
as
a
fountain
in
the
night
and
i
made
no
pause
but
leaped
unto
the
maid
and
had
her
in
a
moment
to
mine
arms
and
onward
again
past
that
dead
thing
that
did
only
then
to
fall
with
an
horrid
sound
and
surely
the
night
did
be
full
of
an
astonishment
and
upliftedness
of
the
millions
so
that
their
spiritual
cryings
did
go
all
about
me
and
did
tell
me
that
they
had
perceived
this
thing
and
did
cast
their
love
and
delight
unto
me
and
a
vast
excitement
to
be
upon
them
and
lo
i
scarce
to
have
gone
a
great
mile
more
but
there
came
two
vague
things
out
of
a
dark
place
where
certain
rocks
did
upstand
and
i
smote
them
with
the
diskos
and
went
onward
but
what
they
did
be
i
never
to
know
and
surely
after
that
i
did
seem
to
go
smiting
forever
for
there
to
come
time
and
oft
strange
things
out
from
the
bushes
and
the
rocks
as
that
all
the
land
did
be
acrawl
with
foul
and
monstrous
life
and
i
to
go
smiting
as
in
a
dream
and
to
speed
forward
ever
with
a
more
fierce
despair
for
surely
the
end
of
our
lives
did
be
come
and
i
not
to
be
given
power
to
save
mine
own
maid
and
all
the
land
did
be
full
of
grim
and
monstrous
roarings
and
oddwise
lower
sounds
very
deadly
and
once
i
did
hear
the
noise
of
giants
running
and
all
the
night
to
be
evil
and
in
verity
how
i
did
not
be
slain
by
some
dread
force
i
not
to
know
unless
that
i
did
be
burned
free
of
all
weakness
that
an
evil
power
should
have
chance
to
harm
me
through
for
indeed
i
had
been
dealt
a
bitter
training
a
monstrous
time
and
lo
there
to
be
again
the
deep
and
dreadful
baying
of
the
nighthounds
unto
the
southeast
and
to
be
nearer
and
i
to
know
now
that
no
strength
of
mine
should
serve
to
protect
mine
own
and
lo
from
the
upwardness
of
the
night
where
did
be
the
last
light
there
sudden
to
come
downward
a
strange
blue
flash
that
smote
downward
into
the
land
unto
the
southeast
and
again
the
flash
to
come
and
mayhap
a
score
times
after
and
there
to
come
down
out
of
the
height
a
peculiar
crackling
sound
that
did
be
less
than
the
thunder
of
this
age
yet
more
loud
than
any
other
sound
that
you
ever
to
hear
and
lo
i
knew
that
the
humans
did
begin
to
fight
for
me
that
i
bring
mine
own
safe
unto
home
and
behold
it
did
be
as
that
all
the
wakefulness
of
the
land
that
had
been
did
be
but
as
sleep
beside
the
wakefulness
that
now
to
come
for
surely
the
night
now
to
seem
to
rock
with
the
roarings
of
the
monsters
and
with
the
bestirring
of
great
forces
and
ever
there
to
go
over
the
land
the
yowling
of
that
strange
and
dreadful
laughter
which
did
come
from
that
hid
country
in
the
night
of
the
lost
east
and
lo
there
arose
constant
now
the
hoarse
and
dreadful
bayings
of
the
hounds
and
made
known
that
a
mighty
pack
did
be
out
and
they
to
seem
to
be
no
more
maybe
than
a
good
mile
unto
the
southeast
and
i
to
be
all
alone
save
for
the
dying
maid
that
i
held
in
mine
arms
and
i
lookt
vainly
and
with
despair
for
the
hundred
thousand
that
did
be
prepared
and
had
come
downward
as
you
do
know
unto
mine
aid
but
truly
there
did
be
naught
to
see
anywheres
save
the
strange
lights
and
shadows
of
the
land
and
the
movement
of
monstrous
life
in
this
place
and
that
place
and
the
hounds
to
come
nearer
with
every
moment
of
time
so
that
indeed
i
knew
that
death
did
be
very
nigh
and
i
ceased
not
from
my
stride
but
went
forward
and
did
begin
to
run
for
the
pyramid
was
not
a
huge
way
off
in
the
night
and
the
shine
of
the
circle
about
it
to
be
plain
seen
save
here
and
there
where
it
did
be
hid
strangely
and
i
to
have
a
despairing
hope
that
i
come
yet
with
mine
own
into
the
safety
of
the
circle
and
the
baying
of
the
hounds
to
come
ever
the
more
near
and
surely
it
did
be
a
doubly
hideous
bitter
thing
that
i
lose
my
dear
one
so
nigh
unto
home
and
the
great
mountain
of
my
home
to
go
upward
before
me
into
the
night
and
to
seem
so
near
that
surely
i
did
be
almost
there
but
yet
mayhap
two
great
miles
off
even
then
and
behold
i
called
out
in
vain
despair
and
to
no
end
why
that
none
come
to
give
me
aid
in
this
extremity
for
the
hounds
did
bay
now
but
the
half
of
a
great
mile
upon
my
left
and
did
surely
have
scent
of
me
by
the
way
of
their
dreadful
baying
and
truly
the
millions
to
have
an
anguish
of
sympathy
for
me
for
the
spiritual
noise
of
their
emotion
did
be
plain
unto
my
spirit
and
they
surely
to
have
seen
and
to
have
interpreted
the
way
that
i
did
look
about
me
and
appear
to
call
out
in
despair
for
there
came
all
about
me
in
a
moment
the
companioning
of
a
great
and
sweet
spiritual
force
which
did
be
bred
of
their
quick
going
with
me
in
their
understanding
and
love
and
they
to
have
perceived
how
that
i
did
be
unto
the
end
of
hope
and
the
hounds
to
be
almost
upon
me
and
in
this
moment
there
came
afresh
to
my
hearing
the
shaking
beat
of
the
earthcurrent
so
that
i
knew
the
humans
to
take
desperate
means
to
save
and
there
came
to
my
view
a
vast
pack
of
the
hounds
unto
my
left
and
they
came
running
at
a
great
pace
and
their
heads
did
be
low
and
they
to
be
so
great
as
horses
and
seen
plain
and
again
in
shadow
all
in
the
same
moment
as
they
did
come
and
in
verity
i
knew
that
we
two
to
be
dead
indeed
ere
a
minute
be
gone
if
that
the
humans
not
to
haste
and
i
stood
where
i
did
be
for
there
was
no
more
use
to
run
and
i
lookt
from
the
hounds
unto
the
mighty
pyramid
and
again
to
the
hounds
and
again
i
lookt
with
my
hope
gone
unto
the
pyramid
for
the
hounds
did
be
scarce
two
hundred
fathoms
off
from
me
and
there
did
be
hundreds
of
the
mighty
beasts
and
lo
even
as
i
lookt
that
last
time
unto
the
pyramid
there
brake
out
a
monstrous
bursting
flame
that
did
rush
downward
from
the
sealed
lower
part
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
the
flame
smote
downward
upon
the
land
where
the
hounds
did
run
and
all
the
night
to
be
lost
from
my
sight
in
the
brightness
and
strangeness
of
that
mighty
flame
so
that
i
saw
no
more
the
pyramid
or
aught
but
only
the
shining
and
dreadful
glory
of
that
flame
and
the
flame
made
a
blast
in
the
night
and
a
hotness
that
did
seem
to
wither
me
even
where
i
did
be
from
it
and
i
perceived
that
the
humans
had
truly
turned
loose
the
earthcurrent
upon
the
hounds
that
i
be
saved
and
there
went
a
constant
great
thundering
over
the
land
because
that
the
earthforce
did
rend
and
split
the
air
and
did
tear
up
the
earth
and
the
roaring
of
the
monsters
did
be
husht
and
lost
in
that
mighty
sound
and
i
to
see
no
place
where
the
hounds
did
be
but
only
flames
and
broken
lands
where
the
earthforce
did
strike
and
great
rocks
did
be
hurled
all
whithers
with
a
vast
noise
and
truly
it
did
be
a
mercy
that
i
was
not
slain
an
hundred
times
if
this
might
be
by
the
failings
and
burstings
of
great
rocks
and
boulders
and
lo
in
a
moment
the
humans
did
cut
off
the
earthforce
and
had
it
again
to
their
control
and
there
to
seem
now
a
great
silence
upon
the
land
and
an
utter
dark
save
that
flames
and
noise
came
from
that
part
where
the
current
did
strike
and
i
very
speedy
to
come
free
of
the
dazedness
that
had
me
and
made
again
to
my
running
for
in
truth
it
to
seem
now
that
i
should
yet
be
let
to
win
unto
safety
with
mine
own
and
mine
eyes
did
grow
presently
unto
their
accustomed
using
and
i
to
look
all
ways
about
me
lest
there
come
somewhat
upon
me
even
then
to
work
our
deaths
and
for
a
good
time
there
to
be
naught
that
i
did
see
anywheres
neither
there
to
be
the
wakeful
sounds
of
the
land
save
only
the
grim
and
horrid
laughter
from
afar
in
the
dead
east
and
oft
as
i
did
run
i
to
stare
hungry
hearted
upward
at
the
mighty
pyramid
and
surely
it
alway
now
to
seem
to
be
less
bright
than
before
and
in
the
first
i
to
set
this
to
the
count
that
mine
eyes
did
be
yet
dazed
by
the
great
flame
of
the
earthforce
but
soon
i
to
perceive
that
it
did
be
otherwise
and
that
there
did
be
truly
a
less
brightness
of
the
light
that
did
shine
throughout
all
the
mighty
redoubt
and
this
lack
i
conceived
had
owing
to
that
great
using
of
the
force
and
power
of
the
earthcurrent
that
had
been
loosed
to
save
us
and
i
to
have
this
new
thing
cold
upon
my
heart
for
truly
if
that
the
force
of
the
current
to
be
made
over
low
there
to
be
a
danger
for
all
the
humans
that
did
live
even
for
all
the
great
millions
of
the
mighty
refuge
and
this
did
be
surely
known
by
the
masters
and
they
to
have
no
more
power
to
aid
me
with
the
current
until
it
flow
strong
again
lest
that
they
destroy
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
and
all
this
to
be
plain
to
me
in
a
moment
as
i
ran
and
i
to
be
but
the
more
desperate
to
come
unto
instant
safety
with
the
maid
and
surely
i
to
be
yet
in
expecting
of
the
hundred
thousand
to
come
unto
me
but
they
not
to
come
and
all
about
me
the
land
to
begin
again
to
give
out
the
noises
of
the
monsters
and
to
send
forth
new
and
peculiar
noises
as
that
there
did
be
more
awaked
in
the
land
than
did
be
ever
heard
by
me
before
and
presently
i
saw
that
there
went
living
things
creeping
between
me
and
the
light
of
the
circle
and
i
to
know
that
i
yet
to
have
to
fight
bitter
if
that
i
would
bring
the
maid
safe
and
i
swung
the
diskos
free
and
ran
on
and
sudden
my
spirit
to
know
that
i
did
be
warned
of
some
new
peril
and
i
to
look
upward
into
the
night
that
the
master
monstruwacan
should
mayhap
to
tell
me
the
danger
by
the
set
speech
but
in
truth
there
came
not
the
quick
flashings
of
the
set
speech
but
only
an
upward
stillness
and
a
dimness
of
the
lights
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
afterward
i
to
learn
that
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
made
to
warn
me
of
danger
but
that
all
the
instruments
of
the
tower
of
observation
to
fail
to
work
and
likewise
all
the
machinery
of
the
pyramid
to
cease
even
unto
the
moving
of
the
great
lifts
and
the
moan
of
the
air
pumps
and
all
to
have
been
this
way
for
nigh
a
great
hour
until
that
the
earthcurrent
did
flow
again
more
full
and
surely
this
doth
show
that
death
did
nigh
to
come
unto
all
the
millions
because
of
the
great
trial
that
did
be
made
to
save
us
but
truly
my
spirit
did
be
warned
by
the
trouble
of
the
millions
and
because
the
master
monstruwacan
called
vaguely
with
his
brainelements
so
that
i
went
ever
more
warily
and
did
look
all
ways
and
lo
sudden
i
to
stare
above
me
into
the
night
and
there
to
be
a
pale
circle
very
quiet
and
steadfast
that
did
go
alway
over
the
twain
of
us
and
i
saw
that
this
did
be
surely
one
of
those
sweet
powers
of
holiness
that
did
stand
between
our
souls
and
some
dread
power
that
came
anigh
to
work
our
destruction
and
i
to
have
no
overfear
but
did
put
my
trust
in
the
force
of
holiness
and
went
forward
running
warily
and
surely
i
came
mayhap
so
nigh
as
to
within
four
hundred
paces
of
the
circle
and
i
to
think
that
i
yet
to
win
mine
own
safe
and
undelayed
within
the
guarding
of
the
circle
and
the
light
of
the
circle
did
burn
dim
so
that
i
had
sudden
fear
whether
that
it
be
any
more
use
for
a
guard
until
that
the
earthcurrent
to
come
more
free
and
all
this
as
i
ran
swift
and
wary
and
utter
anxious
and
lo
in
that
moment
in
a
dim
place
there
rose
up
three
beastmen
from
the
earth
and
came
at
me
growling
and
the
first
did
be
so
close
that
i
had
no
room
to
the
diskos
but
beat
in
the
head
of
the
man
with
the
haftpart
and
i
leaped
unto
the
side
then
and
swung
the
diskos
and
did
be
utter
mad
yet
chill
with
fury
so
that
the
maid
did
be
no
more
than
a
babe
in
the
crook
of
mine
arm
and
i
came
in
sudden
to
meet
the
two
beastmen
as
they
ran
at
me
and
i
cut
quick
and
light
with
the
great
weapon
and
did
have
that
anger
upon
me
which
doth
make
the
heart
a
place
of
cold
and
deadly
intent
so
that
i
had
a
wondrous
and
brutal
judgement
to
the
slaying
and
truly
i
slew
them
as
that
they
had
been
no
more
than
mice
and
i
had
no
harm
neither
so
much
as
a
touch
from
them
and
behold
in
that
moment
there
came
a
great
shout
of
wonder
and
of
welcome
from
within
the
circle
and
i
lookt
swiftly
and
began
again
to
run
for
there
did
be
men
in
grey
armour
all
within
the
circle
yet
came
they
not
to
mine
aid
and
lo
in
a
moment
i
knew
why
that
the
hundred
thousand
did
have
held
off
from
me
in
mine
extremity
for
behold
there
did
be
monstrous
black
mounds
all
along
without
of
the
circle
and
did
rock
and
sway
with
a
force
of
strange
life
that
did
set
an
horror
into
my
soul
as
i
ran
for
truly
they
did
be
the
visible
signs
of
monstrous
forces
of
evil
and
did
any
human
have
ventured
outward
beyond
the
circle
then
had
that
man
been
destroyed
in
the
spirit
and
lost
utterly
so
that
none
had
dared
to
come
neither
had
it
been
of
use
if
any
had
made
themselves
to
be
a
sacrifice
to
aid
me
for
truly
they
to
have
been
of
no
use
when
dead
as
you
shall
say
and
there
came
a
constant
shouting
from
the
hundred
thousand
to
me
that
i
haste
and
indeed
to
haste
and
truly
i
did
haste
with
all
my
strength
and
i
lookt
unto
the
dear
circle
of
holiness
that
did
be
above
us
twain
and
it
to
go
steadfast
over
us
so
that
i
saw
we
to
be
surely
saved
and
lo
i
to
be
no
more
than
an
hundred
paces
now
from
the
glowing
of
the
circle
and
behold
even
in
that
instant
there
must
come
brutal
things
to
destroy
us
for
there
came
an
herd
of
squat
and
brutish
men
all
about
me
in
a
moment
from
the
shadows
where
they
had
been
hid
and
they
caught
at
me
and
caught
at
the
maid
to
tear
her
from
mine
arm
and
truly
it
did
be
as
that
they
surely
to
have
success
for
i
could
nowise
in
a
moment
free
myself
and
yet
to
guard
the
maid
and
to
use
the
diskos
and
lo
i
kickt
with
my
metal
boots
and
gave
from
them
and
turned
all
ways
in
a
moment
and
wrenched
free
and
i
leaped
back
and
the
herd
of
horrid
brutes
after
me
and
now
i
to
have
space
for
the
diskos
and
a
grimness
in
my
heart
and
i
came
round
very
sudden
and
ran
in
among
the
men
smiting
and
i
hit
very
swift
both
from
the
right
and
the
left
and
to
and
fro
with
a
constant
quick
circling
and
the
diskos
did
spin
and
roar
and
made
a
strange
light
upon
the
faces
of
the
men
and
they
to
have
tusks
like
to
the
tusks
of
pigs
and
surely
i
did
rage
through
them
smiting
and
they
to
strike
me
a
thousand
times
with
great
stones
so
that
mine
armour
rang
and
was
all
fresh
burst
and
i
near
to
sicken
under
the
blows
and
new
wounds
but
they
not
to
harm
the
maid
for
i
carried
her
above
their
squat
and
brutish
reach
and
the
brutemen
to
seem
without
end
but
i
made
alway
forward
unto
the
glowing
of
the
circle
and
the
night
to
be
full
in
that
place
of
the
fierce
shoutings
of
the
hundred
thousand
and
manyas
i
did
learnto
have
tried
to
come
unto
me
but
that
their
comrades
held
them
from
so
useless
a
dying
and
in
verity
i
to
be
now
scarce
fifty
paces
from
the
glowing
of
the
circle
and
did
be
nigh
to
fall
for
i
did
be
so
utter
dazed
and
wounded
with
the
fight
and
ill
with
a
vast
weariness
and
the
despair
and
madness
of
my
journey
and
moreover
as
you
do
know
i
not
to
have
slept
but
to
have
carried
the
maid
forever
through
days
and
nights
and
to
have
fought
oft
and
lo
the
hundred
thousand
stood
just
within
the
circle
and
they
that
were
to
the
front
did
swing
each
man
the
diskos
and
they
hurled
each
the
diskos
in
among
the
herd
of
the
tuskt
men
that
did
make
to
slay
me
and
surely
this
to
save
me
for
the
herd
did
thin
to
my
front
and
i
to
gather
my
strength
and
to
charge
with
despair
and
to
smite
and
never
be
ceased
of
smiting
so
that
there
did
be
dead
creatures
all
about
and
behold
i
brake
through
the
herd
with
mine
own
and
did
be
upon
the
circle
and
lo
i
stept
over
the
circle
that
did
scarce
now
to
give
out
a
resistance
and
a
thousand
hands
did
come
forward
to
give
me
help
yet
did
none
touch
me
but
gave
back
from
me
for
there
did
be
that
about
me
which
held
them
off
as
with
a
little
awe
for
i
to
be
strange
unto
them
and
i
stood
there
in
a
great
silence
and
the
diskos
in
my
hand
ran
blood
to
the
haft
and
maybe
i
rockt
as
i
stood
for
many
again
did
put
out
their
hands
as
to
hold
me
and
again
drew
back
and
were
silent
and
i
lookt
unto
them
and
they
lookt
back
at
me
and
i
did
gasp
awhile
and
was
strangely
dazed
and
did
try
to
tell
them
that
i
had
need
of
the
doctors
for
the
life
of
mine
own
maid
that
did
be
dying
in
mine
arms
and
behold
in
that
moment
there
did
be
a
sound
of
giants
running
out
in
the
night
and
some
then
to
cry
out
different
matters
to
aid
me
and
to
beware
of
the
giants
and
to
bring
the
doctors
to
attend
me
on
the
instant
and
other
voices
did
call
that
the
holy
light
was
gone
from
above
and
likewise
the
black
mounds
from
the
outer
part
of
the
circle
and
there
did
be
a
monstrous
noise
of
roarings
in
the
land
and
all
to
come
bewildered
unto
my
brain
which
did
surely
fail
now
with
the
grim
and
utter
stress
which
had
been
mine
so
long
and
there
to
be
also
a
constant
noise
that
came
from
near
and
from
upward
and
truly
i
to
know
as
in
a
dream
that
it
did
be
made
of
the
shouting
of
the
great
millions
that
did
make
an
eternal
and
vague
roaringsound
upward
in
the
night
that
did
come
down
from
the
upper
heights
no
more
loud
than
a
strange
and
continual
murmuring
out
of
the
lofty
miles
and
surely
i
to
find
my
voice
in
a
little
minute
and
did
ask
a
near
man
whether
there
be
any
doctors
with
the
men
and
in
that
moment
there
came
forward
a
master
of
the
diskos
which
doth
be
as
a
commander
of
this
age
and
he
made
the
salute
of
honour
with
the
diskos
and
would
have
eased
the
maid
from
me
but
i
to
ask
again
very
slow
whether
that
there
was
a
doctor
anear
and
he
on
the
instant
to
give
an
order
and
the
great
thousands
to
begin
to
shape
and
did
make
a
mighty
lane
unto
the
great
gateway
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
the
master
of
the
diskos
made
a
sign
to
certain
that
did
be
near
and
they
stood
about
me
as
i
to
know
dully
lest
i
fall
but
they
not
to
touch
me
for
i
did
be
as
that
i
must
not
be
laid
hand
upon
for
i
did
near
to
choke
with
despair
lest
i
to
have
come
home
too
late
and
surely
also
the
men
to
seem
as
that
i
did
be
strange
unto
them
and
there
went
orders
swift
and
constant
this
way
and
that
and
lo
in
a
little
while
there
came
two
big
men
of
the
upward
cities
running
and
they
had
a
little
man
between
them
upon
a
sling
and
the
little
man
did
be
a
master
of
the
doctors
and
he
aided
me
gentle
to
lay
mine
own
maid
upon
the
earth
and
the
master
of
the
diskos
made
a
sign
and
the
men
that
did
be
near
turned
each
his
back
and
the
doctor
to
make
examination
for
the
life
of
mine
own
and
there
to
come
about
that
time
a
seeming
of
silence
in
the
land
and
truly
the
hundred
thousand
did
be
utter
quiet
and
a
great
quiet
in
the
mighty
pyramid
for
in
truth
all
to
know
by
this
that
there
to
be
a
fear
that
the
maid
i
did
bring
out
of
the
night
did
be
slain
by
the
evil
forces
and
sudden
the
little
man
that
did
be
the
master
doctor
lookt
up
quiet
and
piteous
at
me
so
that
i
knew
in
a
moment
that
mine
own
maid
did
be
dead
and
he
to
see
that
i
knew
and
he
covered
the
face
of
mine
own
and
stood
up
very
speedy
and
he
called
softly
to
the
men
that
did
be
to
my
back
and
he
signed
to
them
that
some
to
support
me
and
some
to
lift
mine
own
maid
and
bear
her
unto
the
great
gateway
and
he
lookt
keen
at
me
and
i
to
fight
a
little
that
i
breathe
and
afterward
did
make
with
my
hands
that
the
men
not
to
come
near
me
neither
to
touch
mine
own
and
the
master
doctor
to
understand
that
i
did
be
truly
strong
until
i
die
and
did
beckon
the
men
from
me
and
from
the
maid
and
i
stoopt
in
a
little
and
i
lifted
mine
own
maid
into
mine
arms
for
that
last
journeying
and
i
came
down
the
mighty
lane
of
the
hundred
thousand
all
in
their
grey
armour
and
they
did
make
silent
salute
with
the
diskos
reversed
each
man
as
i
passed
him
and
did
be
utter
silent
and
i
scarce
to
wot
of
aught
save
that
all
the
world
did
be
quiet
and
emptied
and
my
task
to
have
failed
and
mine
own
to
lie
dead
in
mine
arms
yet
truly
did
it
to
have
failed
utter
for
i
had
surely
saved
mine
own
from
the
terror
of
the
second
night
land
and
she
not
to
have
come
alone
and
with
madness
unto
her
death
but
to
have
died
in
mine
arms
and
she
surely
to
have
been
comforted
within
her
spirit
because
that
my
love
did
be
so
utter
about
her
and
i
to
think
vaguely
and
terribly
on
an
hundred
sweet
love
actions
that
she
to
have
shown
unto
me
and
sudden
i
did
remember
with
a
dreadful
pain
how
that
i
never
to
have
waked
to
discover
mine
own
maid
kissing
me
in
my
sleep
as
i
to
have
meant
and
a
madness
of
anguish
did
flash
sudden
through
the
numbness
upon
my
brain
so
that
i
did
be
blinded
a
little
and
surely
went
crooked
in
my
walk
for
i
to
know
sudden
that
the
master
doctor
steadied
mine
elbow
for
a
moment
but
afterward
did
leave
me
be
as
i
to
have
again
control
of
my
spirit
and
lo
as
i
drew
nigh
unto
the
great
gateway
the
lights
of
the
pyramid
to
begin
to
glow
again
more
strong
and
the
machinery
of
the
lifts
and
the
air
pumps
to
work
because
that
now
the
earthcurrent
did
grow
once
more
to
natural
strength
and
they
to
have
power
now
to
open
the
great
gate
which
did
be
done
by
great
machines
and
there
to
come
forth
to
meet
me
a
number
of
the
masters
of
the
mighty
pyramid
and
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
did
come
before
them
all
so
eager
as
that
he
did
be
mine
own
father
and
he
to
have
heard
somewhat
vaguely
that
there
to
have
been
a
fear
for
the
life
of
the
maid
that
i
did
bring
and
surely
he
did
be
told
by
one
near
to
the
gateway
that
the
maid
did
be
dead
in
mine
arms
for
he
and
all
the
masters
did
pause
and
stand
silent
for
me
to
go
by
and
did
reverse
each
his
diskos
and
this
to
have
been
an
honour
shown
than
which
there
did
be
scarce
any
greater
and
there
went
a
constant
murmuring
up
in
the
night
which
did
be
the
speech
of
the
millions
questioning
and
the
news
that
the
maid
did
be
dead
went
upward
through
the
miles
and
my
spirit
to
know
as
in
a
dream
of
the
spiritual
noise
which
did
go
outward
through
all
space
and
did
be
the
grief
of
the
multitudes
as
they
did
hear
this
thing
yet
truly
there
did
nothing
comfort
me
anywise
neither
i
proper
yet
to
know
the
verity
of
my
loss
for
i
did
go
stunned
and
i
came
in
through
the
great
gateway
and
the
full
watch
did
stand
there
silent
in
their
armour
and
they
made
the
salute
of
honour
and
i
went
onward
with
the
dead
maid
that
i
did
bring
out
of
eternity
and
presently
they
that
were
around
did
guide
me
with
the
maid
in
mine
arms
unto
the
great
lift
and
i
took
mine
own
maid
into
the
great
lift
and
the
masters
came
with
me
and
did
be
in
their
armour
and
none
did
speak
to
me
and
the
master
monstruwacan
and
the
master
of
the
doctors
stood
silent
to
the
side
of
me
and
there
did
be
everywhere
great
multitudes
that
i
did
see
vaguely
but
my
spirit
not
to
wot
of
them
and
lo
i
stood
very
quiet
and
dumb
as
we
did
go
upward
through
the
miles
and
the
millions
of
the
cities
stood
about
the
great
lift
and
there
did
be
a
great
silence
upward
and
downward
through
the
strange
miles
save
for
the
weeping
of
women
in
dear
sympathy
that
did
sound
far
and
low
and
constant
and
presently
i
to
know
that
the
master
monstruwacan
and
the
master
of
the
doctors
did
look
one
to
the
other
and
i
to
be
aware
sudden
that
i
stood
in
my
blood
for
i
did
be
wounded
in
an
hundred
parts
and
the
blood
to
go
alway
from
me
yet
did
the
master
doctor
be
slow
to
do
aught
for
me
because
that
he
to
perceive
that
i
did
be
slain
in
the
heart
and
there
to
be
no
pain
so
dreadful
as
that
he
should
be
like
to
wake
me
unto
if
that
he
went
hastily
yet
presently
there
did
come
whirlings
into
my
head
and
someone
did
surely
make
to
ease
mine
own
maid
from
mine
arms
but
i
held
her
dumbly
and
the
blood
to
go
the
more
from
me
and
they
not
to
know
what
should
be
done
and
i
to
look
at
them
and
the
dear
master
monstruwacan
did
be
saying
somewhat
unto
me
that
i
did
have
no
power
to
hear
but
only
to
know
that
his
face
did
be
very
human
and
there
went
a
strange
noise
all
about
me
and
the
master
monstruwacan
to
seem
to
hold
me
up
and
to
beckon
to
some
that
did
be
to
my
back
and
lo
there
came
a
blackness
and
the
gentleness
of
arms
about
mine
armour
and
i
to
come
presently
to
quietness
and
to
halfdreams
and
did
alway
to
seem
that
i
carried
mine
own
maid
in
mine
arms
but
truly
there
did
pass
three
great
days
whilst
that
i
did
be
thus
and
i
all
that
while
to
be
laid
quiet
and
to
be
tended
by
the
master
doctor
and
aided
by
all
knowledge
that
did
be
known
of
humans
and
on
the
third
day
as
it
might
be
called
i
to
come
full
unto
my
senses
and
the
pain
to
take
me
in
the
breast
and
the
master
of
the
doctors
did
be
with
me
and
they
that
nurst
me
and
the
master
doctor
watched
me
very
keen
and
gentle
and
i
did
be
in
a
bed
of
the
health
room
of
mine
own
city
and
i
gat
from
the
bed
and
the
doctor
to
say
naught
but
only
to
watch
me
and
i
walkt
to
and
fro
a
little
and
he
alway
to
watch
me
and
presently
he
gave
me
somewhat
to
drink
and
i
drank
and
i
was
gone
soon
from
all
knowledge
and
i
to
come
again
unto
a
knowing
that
i
yet
to
live
and
there
went
a
certain
strength
in
my
body
and
lo
the
first
that
i
did
see
was
the
master
of
the
doctors
and
i
to
perceive
in
a
moment
that
he
had
wakened
me
and
had
nurst
my
strength
for
that
moment
that
i
live
through
the
burial
for
he
to
be
very
wise
and
to
have
known
from
that
first
seeing
of
me
that
i
not
to
live
after
that
mine
own
did
die
and
there
was
brought
to
me
a
loose
garment
but
i
to
refuse
the
garment
dumbly
and
did
look
about
me
very
troubled
and
forgetting
and
the
master
doctor
lookt
alway
at
me
and
lo
in
a
moment
he
called
one
and
gave
an
order
and
there
was
brought
in
then
my
broken
armour
and
a
garment
to
wear
below
and
i
then
to
know
that
i
did
be
content
in
this
matter
and
the
doctor
alway
to
watch
me
and
they
drest
me
in
my
broken
armour
and
surely
as
they
drest
me
my
spirit
to
hear
the
sorrow
and
sympathy
of
the
multitudes
and
did
know
that
they
went
downward
by
millions
unto
the
country
of
silence
and
lo
in
that
moment
when
i
near
to
be
in
mine
armour
i
to
mind
sudden
again
that
i
never
to
have
waked
to
discover
mine
own
maid
kissing
me
in
my
sleep
and
the
pain
gat
me
in
the
breast
so
that
i
had
surely
ended
then
but
that
the
master
doctor
set
somewhat
to
my
breath
that
eased
me
and
gave
something
of
dullness
unto
my
senses
for
a
while
and
i
did
be
carried
then
in
a
sling
unto
the
great
lift
and
there
did
be
a
bed
in
the
lift
and
the
doctor
to
have
me
to
lie
upon
the
bed
and
i
to
know
that
he
also
to
know
that
i
never
to
need
a
bed
any
more
neither
should
i
ever
to
come
upward
again
in
the
lift
and
truly
the
mighty
pyramid
did
be
an
emptyness
for
there
did
seem
to
be
left
only
the
stress
masters
that
did
arrange
the
moving
of
the
millions
and
the
stress
masters
did
stand
about
the
lift
as
we
dropt
downward
through
the
great
miles
unto
the
underground
fields
and
we
came
downward
in
the
last
unto
the
country
of
silence
which
did
lie
an
hundred
miles
deep
in
the
world
and
did
be
an
hundred
miles
every
way
of
silence
unto
the
dead
and
they
that
were
with
me
gat
me
from
the
lift
and
did
mean
to
carry
me
in
the
sling
unto
the
last
road
but
i
stood
upon
my
feet
and
made
that
i
should
walk
and
i
held
out
my
hand
for
the
diskos
which
one
did
carry
and
the
master
doctor
signed
that
they
should
obey
me
as
my
spirit
to
know
and
i
walkt
very
steadfast
down
the
way
that
did
lead
unto
the
last
road
and
the
master
doctor
walkt
behind
me
a
little
space
off
and
surely
there
did
be
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
in
that
great
country
and
the
peoples
did
be
spread
out
forever
so
far
as
my
seeing
did
go
and
they
to
have
sight
of
me
and
all
the
aether
did
be
stirred
with
the
humanness
of
their
sorrow
and
their
kind
sympathy
and
there
grew
a
murmur
which
did
be
like
to
a
low
rolling
thunder
and
did
be
the
voices
of
the
peoples
and
the
rolling
of
that
great
husht
sound
went
to
and
fro
across
that
mighty
country
of
quiet
and
there
to
be
afterward
an
utter
silence
and
i
saw
below
me
the
place
of
the
last
rest
where
did
be
the
beginning
of
the
last
road
and
there
did
lie
there
a
little
figure
covered
with
a
white
robe
that
did
glimmer
with
the
beauteous
work
of
women
that
had
stitcht
love
and
honour
into
that
last
garment
and
surely
i
to
rock
upon
my
feet
and
to
steady
myself
with
the
diskos
and
the
master
doctor
to
be
unto
my
side
in
a
moment
and
gave
me
again
something
that
i
breathein
but
indeed
i
to
refuse
after
that
i
had
taken
one
breath
of
the
drug
for
i
to
be
able
to
bear
my
pain
the
little
time
that
i
now
to
have
to
live
and
i
to
mean
that
i
have
no
dimness
of
my
senses
for
those
short
minutes
that
i
should
have
yet
near
unto
mine
own
and
truly
the
master
doctor
did
not
press
me
anywise
but
had
a
perfect
understanding
and
went
quiet
again
to
the
rearward
and
i
came
soon
to
that
place
where
mine
own
dead
one
did
lie
and
the
master
monstruwacan
stood
to
her
feet
and
did
be
clothed
in
grey
armour
and
had
the
diskos
reversed
and
this
to
be
for
an
honour
unto
my
dead
maid
and
there
kneeled
two
maids
in
white
one
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
of
mine
own
and
they
to
be
for
faithfulness
and
did
be
maids
because
that
they
watched
by
a
maid
and
had
likewise
been
matrons
if
that
the
dead
had
been
wife
unto
any
and
the
place
at
the
head
of
the
last
rest
did
be
empty
and
did
be
for
me
and
he
that
stood
to
the
head
did
be
for
love
for
it
did
be
the
chief
and
did
hold
dominion
over
and
did
make
to
live
both
faithfulness
and
honour
and
this
to
be
the
way
of
the
burial
alway
and
lo
i
took
my
courage
into
my
heart
and
i
stood
to
the
head
of
mine
own
maid
and
i
lookt
down
upon
the
wondrous
white
glory
of
the
garment
which
did
be
white
because
that
mine
own
did
be
a
maid
yet
did
be
worked
with
yellow
flowers
of
weeping
as
we
did
call
them
because
that
she
had
died
in
love
and
i
to
know
that
no
hand
had
toucht
that
wonderful
garment
save
the
hands
of
maidens
and
behold
as
i
stood
there
from
far
away
over
the
land
there
did
come
a
far
and
faint
sound
and
the
sound
did
come
more
nigh
so
that
i
knew
that
afar
off
beyond
the
hills
of
the
babes
the
millions
did
begin
to
sing
the
calling
song
where
million
did
call
husht
unto
million
and
the
sound
did
come
onward
toward
where
we
did
be
and
did
go
over
us
and
pass
onward
in
a
husht
and
wondrous
breathing
of
sound
as
that
all
the
love
that
did
be
ever
in
this
world
did
call
in
a
low
anguish
unto
a
lost
beloved
and
the
sound
to
pass
away
and
away
over
that
mighty
country
in
the
deep
earth
and
did
hush
and
hush
unto
a
great
and
utter
silence
save
for
a
faint
murmur
of
countless
women
weeping
that
did
be
in
the
air
of
that
land
of
quiet
and
there
to
be
a
space
of
silence
and
again
the
silence
to
be
broken
by
a
far
sound
and
there
to
come
again
from
beyond
the
far
hills
of
the
babes
a
strange
and
low
sound
and
did
be
as
of
a
wind
wandering
through
damp
forests
and
the
sound
grew
and
came
across
the
hills
of
the
babes
and
did
be
breathed
forth
by
million
after
million
so
that
in
a
little
i
to
hear
the
song
of
weeping
sung
very
low
and
sorrowful
by
the
multitudes
and
the
song
came
onward
over
all
that
great
country
and
past
over
us
and
went
onward
into
the
far
land
beyond
the
dome
and
did
be
caught
by
the
voices
of
millions
that
did
be
hid
in
great
distances
and
so
to
go
onward
forever
and
to
die
at
last
unto
a
mighty
silence
and
the
master
monstruwacan
lookt
at
me
from
the
feet
of
mine
own
maid
and
i
to
know
that
the
moment
did
be
come
when
i
to
part
from
the
maid
naani
forever
and
forever
even
though
i
to
live
in
some
strange
future
and
to
find
her
soul
in
some
other
sweet
child
and
i
stoopt
and
laid
the
diskos
beside
mine
own
maid
there
upon
the
last
rest
and
the
two
maids
drew
back
the
light
wonder
of
the
garment
and
showed
me
the
face
of
mine
own
and
she
to
sleep
there
forever
so
sweet
and
husht
as
a
child
and
as
oft
i
to
have
seen
her
to
sleep
and
i
lookt
a
little
while
and
the
pain
of
my
heart
did
be
sufficient
so
that
i
knew
i
died
as
i
lookt
and
once
more
i
lookt
and
i
set
my
soul
about
mine
own
and
i
fought
with
myself
and
stood
upward
and
the
maids
did
cover
the
face
of
mine
own
maid
and
the
master
monstruwacan
commended
naani
unto
eternity
and
he
raised
the
diskos
reversed
and
lo
the
road
did
begin
to
move
upward
unto
the
dome
and
mine
own
maid
did
be
upon
the
road
and
i
to
fight
that
i
keep
breathing
so
that
i
not
to
die
before
she
be
lost
utter
to
my
sight
and
there
did
rise
now
a
sound
from
all
that
country
that
had
no
order
in
it
and
did
be
like
to
a
low
moaning
that
did
fill
all
the
air
of
the
land
and
there
to
be
also
a
constant
sound
as
of
a
little
whistling
dree
wind
that
did
be
in
all
that
country
of
quiet
and
truly
this
to
be
more
than
any
singing
for
it
to
be
the
true
weeping
of
multitudes
that
did
sorrow
from
the
heart
with
the
grief
of
this
thing
that
did
be
and
i
stood
utter
still
and
did
draw
my
breath
very
even
and
lookt
unto
that
small
form
that
did
be
now
afar
off
where
it
did
lie
upon
the
moving
roadway
and
i
gazed
as
that
my
soul
and
all
my
being
did
have
no
power
else
even
as
a
man
that
dies
doth
set
all
his
strength
to
a
last
movement
and
i
not
to
wot
that
the
master
monstruwacan
and
the
two
maids
did
hold
me
up
because
they
to
perceive
that
i
did
be
dying
for
i
only
to
see
mine
own
little
one
lying
afar
off
upon
the
moving
of
the
last
road
and
the
maid
in
that
moment
to
come
to
the
place
where
the
road
did
pass
into
the
strange
and
luminous
vapour
of
the
earthcurrent
which
did
lie
all
about
the
base
of
the
dome
and
the
vapour
to
be
only
as
a
faint
shining
smoke
scarce
seen
yet
to
be
enough
to
give
something
of
uncertainty
to
the
dead
when
that
they
did
have
past
inward
of
it
and
i
stared
with
all
that
did
be
left
of
my
strength
for
mine
own
to
be
gone
utter
and
forever
in
but
a
little
minute
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
luminous
vapour
did
cling
about
her
and
to
make
her
to
seem
unreal
to
my
gaze
for
the
vapour
did
be
in
constant
movement
and
to
give
a
seeming
of
shifting
to
and
fro
of
all
that
did
be
in
it
and
behold
as
i
did
stare
with
my
dreadful
pain
there
did
be
sudden
a
strange
hoarse
noise
from
the
nearer
millions
and
lo
in
an
instant
there
came
a
mighty
shout
out
of
all
that
country
and
the
shout
did
be
made
again
and
did
grow
into
a
mighty
hoarse
roaring
from
the
millions
so
that
all
that
great
country
did
be
filled
with
the
monstrous
sound
and
in
verity
i
to
have
seen
the
thing
likewise
but
to
have
set
it
to
the
madness
of
longing
of
my
heart
and
to
that
desperate
and
dreadful
pain
which
did
make
me
to
be
crazed
and
lost
from
all
sane
thinking
and
the
thing
that
i
did
see
had
been
that
the
maid
did
seem
to
move
there
upon
the
last
road
where
she
did
lie
but
indeed
this
to
have
appeared
only
to
be
the
stirring
of
the
luminous
vapour
of
the
earthcurrent
which
did
seem
to
make
things
shift
as
i
have
told
and
lo
i
now
to
see
truly
that
the
maid
did
move
where
she
was
laid
afar
off
upon
the
road
and
i
now
to
know
and
to
believe
that
she
did
indeed
live
and
my
life
came
into
me
with
a
bounding
yet
did
my
heart
seem
to
be
a
moment
stilled
in
my
breast
and
the
master
monstruwacan
to
have
signed
already
that
the
roadway
be
stopt
and
brought
backward
but
i
to
be
now
upon
the
last
road
and
did
run
as
a
madman
shouting
vainly
upon
the
name
of
mine
own
and
i
to
learn
afterward
that
there
to
have
been
a
dreadful
peril
that
all
the
near
millions
to
rush
toward
the
last
road
and
so
mayhap
to
have
caused
the
death
of
many
and
to
have
been
like
to
have
crusht
mine
own
but
this
danger
to
have
been
eased
because
that
the
watch
master
did
act
very
prompt
and
set
the
great
regiments
of
his
men
to
keep
back
the
millions
and
did
send
a
signal
abroad
over
all
the
country
that
there
to
be
calmness
for
that
the
maid
should
be
succoured
and
alway
whilst
this
to
be
i
did
run
staggering
most
strangely
upward
of
the
last
road
and
surely
that
great
roof
did
ring
and
boom
with
the
constant
and
mighty
shoutings
of
the
millions
and
there
did
run
others
also
along
the
road
to
my
back
but
i
to
have
been
the
first
and
to
make
a
good
speed
though
i
did
stagger
and
rock
so
strange
upon
my
feet
and
the
road
alway
to
be
moving
backward
under
me
and
so
i
to
be
come
wonderful
soon
unto
where
the
maid
did
be
and
she
to
be
upon
her
back
and
to
have
pusht
the
garment
from
her
face
and
did
be
lying
with
her
eyes
open
and
a
look
of
gentle
wonderment
upon
her
dear
face
and
she
then
to
see
me
and
her
eyes
did
smile
at
me
very
glad
and
quiet
for
there
to
be
yet
an
utter
weakness
upon
her
and
lo
i
came
with
a
falling
beside
her
and
i
gat
upon
my
knees
and
upon
my
hands
and
my
heart
did
shake
my
lips
to
dry
whisperings
and
she
to
look
weak
and
steadfast
unto
me
and
i
to
look
forever
at
her
and
i
did
alway
try
to
say
things
unto
her
but
my
mouth
to
refuse
me
and
understanding
did
come
into
her
as
a
light
and
she
to
know
in
that
instant
that
she
to
be
truly
come
into
the
mighty
pyramid
and
i
to
have
gat
her
there
somewise
and
she
to
wake
sudden
in
her
body
and
set
her
hands
forth
all
atrembling
from
the
garment
and
in
dreadful
trouble
and
i
to
see
then
that
the
blood
did
go
from
me
constant
and
the
maid
to
have
perceived
this
thing
so
that
she
was
waked
the
more
proper
in
a
moment
from
her
deathswoon
and
surely
i
did
bleed
very
dreadful
for
all
my
wounds
did
be
opened
with
my
running
and
i
to
have
sudden
power
with
my
lips
and
did
say
unto
her
very
simple
that
i
loved
her
and
she
to
be
all
in
an
haze
from
me
and
i
to
know
that
she
to
have
come
likewise
unto
her
knees
and
did
have
my
head
upon
her
breast
and
there
to
be
an
utter
shaking
of
the
air
with
some
great
sound
and
a
mighty
spiritual
stirring
of
the
aether
of
the
world
and
there
to
be
then
the
voice
of
the
master
monstruwacan
very
dull
in
mine
ears
and
the
low
voice
of
the
master
doctor
but
i
never
to
hear
what
they
did
be
saying
and
did
know
only
that
mine
own
maid
did
live
and
i
not
to
mean
to
die
but
to
fight
unto
living
and
even
whilst
that
i
made
this
resolving
i
was
gone
into
an
utter
blackness
xvii
the
love
days
now
when
that
i
gat
back
unto
life
i
to
know
that
i
went
upward
in
the
lift
and
did
be
upon
that
same
bed
where
i
to
think
i
never
to
need
a
bed
any
more
neither
to
come
upward
again
from
out
of
the
country
of
silence
and
i
to
know
vague
and
strange
that
there
rose
up
from
out
of
the
mighty
depths
of
the
world
the
deep
thunder
of
the
underground
organs
and
did
sound
as
that
they
made
a
strange
and
utter
distant
music
beyond
death
and
there
to
go
alway
a
rolling
chaunting
as
that
multitudes
did
sing
beyond
far
mountains
and
the
sound
to
be
somewhiles
as
a
farblowing
wind
low
in
the
deep
and
again
to
come
clear
and
to
be
that
great
olden
melody
of
the
song
of
honour
and
i
knew
as
in
a
dream
that
the
millions
in
that
deep
country
made
an
honour
and
a
rejoicing
over
this
wonder
of
joy
which
did
be
come
but
yet
all
to
be
faint
and
half
hid
from
me
and
mine
eyes
to
be
as
that
they
had
no
power
to
open
and
i
to
seem
to
be
lifting
alway
upon
strange
waters
of
unrealness
and
there
to
be
sweet
and
lovely
odours
and
these
to
be
of
reality
and
to
come
from
the
great
fields
where
the
flowers
did
alway
to
grow
about
the
passage
ways
of
the
lifts
for
the
lift
even
then
to
be
going
upward
through
the
great
miles
and
mayhap
i
moved
a
little
for
there
came
the
voice
of
the
master
doctor
low
and
gentle
to
me
and
bid
me
rest
for
that
all
did
be
well
with
the
maid
and
surely
afterward
i
did
be
gone
into
an
haze
and
there
to
be
then
a
seeming
of
days
in
which
i
half
to
live
and
half
to
sleep
and
to
wonder
without
trouble
whether
i
did
be
dead
and
then
there
to
come
days
when
i
lay
very
quiet
and
had
no
thought
of
aught
and
the
master
doctor
oft
to
bend
over
me
in
this
hour
and
that
hour
and
to
look
keen
into
my
face
and
in
the
end
after
strange
spaces
there
bent
over
me
another
and
there
lookt
down
upon
me
the
dear
and
lovely
face
of
mine
own
and
the
eyes
did
speak
love
into
my
soul
yet
did
she
be
calm
and
husht
and
i
to
begin
again
to
live
in
my
body
and
i
made
mayhap
a
little
fumbling
with
my
hands
for
she
to
take
and
to
hold
them
and
life
to
come
from
her
to
me
and
she
to
be
ever
wordless
and
gentle
and
contentment
to
grow
in
me
and
presently
a
natural
slumber
and
there
came
a
day
when
i
did
be
let
rise
and
they
that
tended
me
carried
me
to
one
of
the
quiet
gardens
of
the
pyramid
and
they
set
me
there
and
did
seem
to
leave
me
alone
and
there
came
one
then
around
a
bush
and
lookt
at
me
a
moment
as
with
an
half
shyness
only
that
the
love
that
did
shine
in
her
eyes
made
the
shyness
to
be
a
little
thing
and
truly
i
knew
that
it
did
be
mine
own
maid
but
i
never
before
to
have
seen
naani
drest
pretty
as
a
maid
and
i
lookt
to
her
and
knew
that
she
did
be
more
dainty
than
even
i
to
have
known
and
sudden
i
made
that
i
rise
to
come
unto
her
but
she
to
run
quick
to
me
that
she
stop
me
of
this
natural
foolishness
and
she
then
to
sit
beside
me
and
to
take
my
head
against
her
breast
and
she
not
to
deny
me
her
lips
but
to
be
both
a
maid
and
a
mother
to
me
in
the
same
moment
and
afterward
she
had
me
to
be
very
still
and
we
to
sit
there
in
an
utter
dumb
happiness
until
they
that
did
attend
me
were
come
again
and
the
master
of
the
doctors
did
be
with
them
and
i
to
see
that
there
went
something
of
satisfaction
in
his
face
and
after
that
day
i
saw
mine
own
maid
every
day
and
i
gat
better
unto
health
with
a
wondrous
quickness
for
love
did
mend
me
and
soon
i
did
be
let
go
downward
unto
the
fields
but
yet
to
go
by
private
ways
because
that
the
multitudes
should
be
like
to
follow
me
alway
and
i
to
need
to
be
quiet
and
the
maid
to
be
with
me
for
the
master
monstruwacan
and
the
master
of
the
doctors
did
agree
upon
this
matter
and
had
an
officer
of
marriage
to
wed
us
and
we
to
be
married
very
quiet
and
simple
for
i
yet
to
be
overweak
for
the
public
marriage
which
we
to
have
later
when
truly
the
millions
made
us
a
guard
of
honour
eight
miles
high
from
the
top
unto
the
bottom
of
the
mighty
pyramid
but
this
to
have
been
later
as
i
do
tell
and
did
be
a
ceremonial
of
the
peoples
because
that
they
not
to
be
denied
that
they
give
me
an
honour
and
surely
the
maid
to
be
with
me
alway
and
did
be
now
my
wife
and
my
strength
to
come
alway
upon
me
and
mine
own
to
grow
again
unto
a
perfect
health
and
in
verity
we
did
be
now
in
the
love
days
which
do
be
the
most
beauteous
if
that
the
love
to
be
true
and
we
did
wander
through
the
mighty
fields
at
our
will
and
walkt
in
the
love
paths
of
the
fields
which
did
be
alway
anear
to
those
places
where
did
be
the
villages
and
i
to
hide
our
name
lest
we
to
be
beset
by
any
out
of
natural
curiousness
and
kindliness
for
we
to
need
to
be
utter
together
and
quiet
and
we
to
chose
those
places
for
our
slumber
where
beauty
of
flowers
did
be
most
wondrous
and
we
to
carry
somewhat
of
food
with
us
but
also
to
eat
when
we
came
unto
the
villages
which
did
be
here
and
there
in
the
fields
which
were
truly
so
huge
as
countries
and
mine
own
did
make
good
her
promise
an
hundred
times
as
you
shall
say
and
did
prepare
me
a
great
and
hearty
meal
and
did
tease
me
utter
that
i
did
be
a
glutton
as
i
did
eat
and
kist
me
lest
that
i
have
ever
a
chance
to
say
aught
in
mine
own
defence
and
truly
she
did
be
all
that
my
heart
and
my
spirit
did
desire
and
she
to
have
companioned
me
with
love
and
to
have
entered
my
spirit
into
joy
and
once
we
to
go
downward
unto
the
country
of
silence
but
not
to
stay
very
long
at
that
time
because
that
my
memory
did
return
upon
me
yet
in
the
after
time
we
to
wander
there
oft
with
memory
and
holiness
of
great
thinkings
and
with
love
which
doth
hold
all
and
as
we
to
leave
that
country
i
to
tell
mine
own
how
that
when
she
had
been
suspend
of
her
life
by
the
horrid
force
of
the
house
i
to
have
minded
me
with
a
dreadful
pain
that
i
never
to
have
waked
to
discover
her
kissing
me
when
that
i
did
sleep
and
surely
mine
own
dear
one
did
blush
most
lovely
and
had
never
known
that
i
did
be
aware
of
her
sweet
naughtiness
and
she
then
to
have
all
thought
for
mine
agony
when
that
she
did
be
dead
ere
the
vapour
of
life
of
the
earthforce
did
set
her
spirit
free
of
the
silence
and
she
to
come
unto
me
in
dear
understanding
and
she
then
to
tell
me
that
the
doctors
to
say
that
she
had
been
as
it
were
stunned
and
froze
of
the
spirit
and
all
her
being
and
life
suspend
and
the
great
lifeforce
of
the
earthcurrent
to
have
waked
her
spirit
and
her
body
then
to
live
and
her
blood
to
flow
proper
again
and
the
doctors
had
talkt
much
and
searched
much
of
late
in
the
olden
records
of
their
work
and
they
to
have
found
somewhat
of
one
such
happening
in
the
olden
time
but
truly
naught
such
to
have
been
ever
through
a
mighty
age
of
years
and
whilst
that
we
to
wander
and
to
rest
in
the
fields
i
oft
to
tell
mine
own
of
this
matter
and
that
matter
and
i
to
know
that
she
had
learned
somewhat
of
odd
things
ere
i
did
be
come
to
health
but
not
overmuch
for
she
also
to
have
been
utter
alack
as
you
shall
think
and
to
have
come
from
her
bed
when
that
i
did
lie
so
still
for
the
master
doctor
to
have
ordained
this
because
he
to
fear
that
i
to
be
going
truly
to
die
if
that
he
not
to
do
somewhat
to
awaken
my
spirit
and
in
verity
you
shall
think
upon
the
deepness
of
my
love
as
i
to
know
that
she
did
have
held
my
hands
so
brave
and
gentle
whilst
that
she
to
have
scarce
power
to
her
feet
and
i
to
say
a
little
holy
praise
of
mine
own
and
so
do
i
come
to
mine
ending
and
have
but
one
more
thing
that
i
tell
and
this
to
happen
a
while
later
after
that
mine
own
and
i
had
gone
through
the
second
marriage
which
did
be
the
public
marriage
for
it
did
be
that
one
day
my
wife
that
did
be
mine
own
did
take
me
with
a
sweet
cunning
unto
the
hall
of
honour
and
surely
when
i
was
come
there
i
to
see
that
many
of
the
peoples
did
be
in
that
great
hall
and
did
stand
about
in
a
silence
yet
as
that
they
had
no
meaning
to
do
aught
but
yet
to
be
that
they
did
wait
upon
somewhat
and
my
wife
did
go
forward
with
me
unto
the
centre
place
of
the
hall
and
sudden
i
saw
why
that
she
did
bring
me
so
cunning
sweet
for
there
did
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
hall
of
honour
in
the
place
of
honour
a
statue
of
a
man
in
broken
armour
that
did
carry
a
maid
forever
and
i
did
be
dumb
and
how
of
this
age
shall
you
to
know
the
honour
that
this
to
mean
in
that
for
it
did
be
an
honour
that
was
given
only
to
the
great
dead
and
i
to
be
but
a
young
man
and
did
be
so
utter
far
off
from
greatness
save
that
i
to
love
with
all
my
heart
and
with
all
my
spirit
and
therefore
death
to
be
but
a
little
thing
before
love
and
you
to
know
how
love
doth
make
sweet
and
brave
the
heart
and
to
have
understanding
with
me
in
my
humbleness
and
my
wonder
and
my
natural
pride
that
there
did
any
so
think
to
honour
me
and
mine
own
did
be
weeping
with
joy
and
honest
pride
of
her
man
beside
me
and
there
to
be
an
utter
silence
of
dear
sympathy
in
all
the
great
hall
of
honour
and
they
that
did
be
there
to
let
me
go
in
quietness
with
mine
own
which
did
be
a
lovely
thing
of
understanding
and
i
to
go
loving
and
thoughtful
with
mine
own
wife
and
she
to
be
very
nigh
to
me
and
i
to
have
gained
honour
yet
to
have
learned
that
honour
doth
be
but
as
the
ash
of
life
if
that
you
not
to
have
love
and
i
to
have
love
and
to
have
love
is
to
have
all
for
that
which
doth
be
truly
love
doth
mother
honour
and
faithfulness
and
they
three
to
build
the
house
of
joy
