Zipf's Law Analysis

In this report, my aim is to analyze several corpora from different authors and genres. To accomplish this goal, I first conducted a brief literature review. Through a thorough analysis of several corpora, it is shown that these works are closely aligned with Zipf’s law, which states that as the rank of a word type increases, its frequency decreases. Additionally, my experiments revealed that although features mentioned in the analysis, such as the slope of a linear regression fit for the log-log curves, could be used as a possible feature for clustering various corpora, in many cases these kinds of features might not be sufficient for the clustering task, and we might need an extra set of features for more accurate clustering. Despite this fact, they may still be helpful in distinguishing certain writing styles from others. Finally, I conduct an analysis to see if randomly generated text follows Zipf’s law or not.
