lorna
doone
a
romance
of
exmoor
by
r
d
blackmore
preface
this
work
is
called
a
romance
because
the
incidents
characters
time
and
scenery
are
alike
romantic
and
in
shaping
this
old
tale
the
writer
neither
dares
nor
desires
to
claim
for
it
the
dignity
or
cumber
it
with
the
difficulty
of
an
historic
novel
and
yet
he
thinks
that
the
outlines
are
filled
in
more
carefully
and
the
situations
however
simple
more
warmly
coloured
and
quickened
than
a
reader
would
expect
to
find
in
what
is
called
a
legend
and
he
knows
that
any
son
of
exmoor
chancing
on
this
volume
cannot
fail
to
bring
to
mind
the
nursetales
of
his
childhoodthe
savage
deeds
of
the

i
elements
of
education
if
anybody
cares
to
read
a
simple
tale
told
simply
i
john
ridd
of
the
parish
of
oare
in
the
county
of
somerset
yeoman
and
churchwarden
have
seen
and
had
a
share
in
some
doings
of
this
neighborhood
which
i
will
try
to
set
down
in
order
god
sparing
my
life
and
memory
and
they
who
light
upon
this
book
should
bear
in
mind
not
only
that
i
write
for
the
clearing
of
our
parish
from
ill
fame
and
calumny
but
also
a
thing
which
will
i
trow
appear
too
often
in
it
to
witthat
i
am
nothing
more
than
a
plain
unlettered
man
not
read
in
foreign
languages
as
a
gentleman
might
be
nor
gifted
with
long
words
even
in
mine
own
tongue
save
what
i
may
have
won
from
the
bible
or
master
william
shakespeare
whom
in
the
face
of
common
opinion
i
do
value
highly
in
short
i
am
an
ignoramus
but
pretty
well
for
a
yeoman
my
father
being
of
good
substance
at
least
as
we
reckon
in
exmoor
and
seized
in
his
own
right
from
many
generations
of
one
and
that
the
best
and
largest
of
the
three
farms
into
which
our
parish
is
divided
or
rather
the
cultured
part
thereof
he
john
ridd
the
elder
churchwarden
and
overseer
being
a
great
admirer
of
learning
and
well
able
to
write
his
name
sent
me
his
only
son
to
be
schooled
at
tiverton
in
the
county
of
devon
for
the
chief
boast
of
that
ancient
town
next
to
its
woollen
staple
is
a
worthy
grammarschool
the
largest
in
the
west
of
england
founded
and
handsomely
endowed
in
the
year
1604
by
master
peter
blundell
of
that
same
place
clothier
here
by
the
time
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
had
risen
into
the
upper
school
and
could
make
bold
with
eutropius
and
caesarby
aid
of
an
english
versionand
as
much
as
six
lines
of
ovid
some
even
said
that
i
might
before
manhood
rise
almost
to
the
third
form
being
of
a
perservering
nature
albeit
by
full
consent
of
all
except
my
mother
thickheaded
but
that
would
have
been
as
i
now
perceive
an
ambition
beyond
a
farmers
son
for
there
is
but
one
form
above
it
and
that
made
of
masterful
scholars
entitled
rightly
monitors
so
it
came
to
pass
by
the
grace
of
god
that
i
was
called
away
from
learning
whilst
sitting
at
the
desk
of
the
junior
first
in
the
upper
school
and
beginning
the
greek
verb
greek
word
my
eldest
grandson
makes
bold
to
say
that
i
never
could
have
learned
greek
word
ten
pages
further
on
being
all
he
himself
could
manage
with
plenty
of
stripes
to
help
him
i
know
that
he
hath
more
head
than
ithough
never
will
he
have
such
body
and
am
thankful
to
have
stopped
betimes
with
a
meek
and
wholesome
headpiece
but
if
you
doubt
of
my
having
been
there
because
now
i
know
so
little
go
and
see
my
name
john
ridd
graven
on
that
very
form
forsooth
from
the
time
i
was
strong
enough
to
open
a
knife
and
to
spell
my
name
i
began
to
grave
it
in
the
oak
first
of
the
block
whereon
i
sate
and
then
of
the
desk
in
front
of
it
according
as
i
was
promoted
from
one
to
other
of
them
and
there
my
grandson
reads
it
now
at
this
present
time
of
writing
and
hath
fought
a
boy
for
scoffing
at
itjohn
ridd
his
nameand
done
again
in
winkeys
a
mischievous
but
cheerful
device
in
which
we
took
great
pleasure
this
is
the
manner
of
a
winkey
which
i
here
set
down
lest
child
of
mine
or
grandchild
dare
to
make
one
on
my
premises
if
he
does
i
shall
know
the
mark
at
once
and
score
it
well
upon
him
the
scholar
obtains
by
prayer
or
price
a
handful
of
saltpetre
and
then
with
the
knife
wherewith
he
should
rather
be
trying
to
mend
his
pens
what
does
he
do
but
scoop
a
hole
where
the
desk
is
some
three
inches
thick
this
hole
should
be
left
with
the
middle
exalted
and
the
circumfere
dug
more
deeply
then
let
him
fill
it
with
saltpetre
all
save
a
little
space
in
the
midst
where
the
boss
of
the
wood
is
upon
that
boss
and
it
will
be
the
better
if
a
splinter
of
timber
rise
upward
he
sticks
the
end
of
his
candle
of
tallow
or
rats
tail
as
we
called
it
kindled
and
burning
smoothly
anon
as
he
reads
by
that
light
his
lesson
lifting
his
eyes
now
and
then
it
may
be
the
fire
of
candle
lays
hold
of
the
petre
with
a
spluttering
noise
and
a
leaping
then
should
the
pupil
seize
his
pen
and
regardless
of
the
nib
stir
bravely
and
he
will
see
a
glow
as
of
burning
mountains
and
a
rich
smoke
and
sparks
going
merrily
nor
will
it
cease
if
he
stir
wisely
and
there
be
a
good
store
of
petre
until
the
wood
is
devoured
through
like
the
sinking
of
a
wellshaft
now
well
may
it
go
with
the
head
of
a
boy
intent
upon
his
primer
who
betides
to
sit
thereunder
but
above
all
things
have
good
care
to
exercise
this
art
before
the
master
strides
up
to
his
desk
in
the
early
gray
of
the
morning
other
customs
no
less
worthy
abide
in
the
school
of
blundell
such
as
the
singeing
of
nightcaps
but
though
they
have
a
pleasant
savour
and
refreshing
to
think
of
i
may
not
stop
to
note
them
unless
it
be
that
goodly
one
at
the
incoming
of
a
flood
the
schoolhouse
stands
beside
a
stream
not
very
large
called
lowman
which
flows
into
the
broad
river
of
exe
about
a
mile
below
this
lowman
stream
although
it
be
not
fond
of
brawl
and
violence
in
the
manner
of
our
lynn
yet
is
wont
to
flood
into
a
mighty
head
of
waters
when
the
storms
of
rain
provoke
it
and
most
of
all
when
its
little
comate
called
the
taunton
brookwhere
i
have
plucked
the
very
best
cresses
that
ever
man
put
salt
oncomes
foaming
down
like
a
great
roan
horse
and
rears
at
the
leap
of
the
hedgerows
then
are
the
gray
stone
walls
of
blundell
on
every
side
encompassed
the
vale
is
spread
over
with
looping
waters
and
it
is
a
hard
thing
for
the
dayboys
to
get
home
to
their
suppers
and
in
that
time
old
cop
the
porter
so
called
because
he
hath
copper
boots
to
keep
the
wet
from
his
stomach
and
a
nose
of
copper
also
in
right
of
other
waters
his
place
is
to
stand
at
the
gate
attending
to
the
floodboards
grooved
into
one
another
and
so
to
watch
the
torrents
rise
and
not
be
washed
away
if
it
please
god
he
may
help
it
but
long
ere
the
flood
hath
attained
this
height
and
while
it
is
only
waxing
certain
boys
of
deputy
will
watch
at
the
stoop
of
the
drainholes
and
be
apt
to
look
outside
the
walls
when
cop
is
taking
a
cordial
and
in
the
very
front
of
the
gate
just
without
the
archway
where
the
ground
is
paved
most
handsomely
you
may
see
in
copyletters
done
a
great
pb
of
white
pebbles
now
it
is
the
custom
and
the
law
that
when
the
invading
waters
either
fluxing
along
the
wall
from
below
the
roadbridge
or
pouring
sharply
across
the
meadows
from
a
cut
called
owens
ditchand
i
myself
have
seen
it
come
both
waysupon
the
very
instant
when
the
waxing
element
lips
though
it
be
but
a
single
pebble
of
the
founders
letters
it
is
in
the
license
of
any
boy
soever
small
and
undoctrined
to
rush
into
the
great
schoolrooms
where
a
score
of
masters
sit
heavily
and
scream
at
the
top
of
his
voice
pb
then
with
a
yell
the
boys
leap
up
or
break
away
from
their
standing
they
toss
their
caps
to
the
blackbeamed
roof
and
haply
the
very
books
after
them
and
the
great
boys
vex
no
more
the
small
ones
and
the
small
boys
stick
up
to
the
great
ones
one
with
another
hard
they
go
to
see
the
gain
of
the
waters
and
the
tribulation
of
cop
and
are
prone
to
kick
the
dayboys
out
with
words
of
scanty
compliment
then
the
masters
look
at
one
another
having
no
class
to
look
to
and
boys
being
no
more
left
to
watch
in
a
manner
they
put
their
mouths
up
with
a
spirited
bang
they
close
their
books
and
make
invitation
the
one
to
the

the

the

away
from
cold

but
lo
i
am
dwelling
on
little
things
and
the
pigeons

of
the
infancy
forgetting
the
bitter

heavy
life
gone
over
me

if
i
am
neither
a
hard
man

a
very
close
one
god

i
have
had
no
lack
of
rubbing

pounding
to
make
stone
of
me
yet
can
i
not
somehow
believe
that
we
ought
to
hate
one
another
to
live
far
asunder
and
block
the
mouth
each
of
his
little
den
as
do
the
wild
beasts
of
the
wood

the
cause
of
my
leaving
tiverton
school
and
the
way
of
it
were
as
follows
on
the
29th
day
of
november
in
the
year
of
our
lord
1673
the
very
day
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
and
had
spent
all
my
substance
in
sweetmeats
with
which
i
made
treat
to
the
little
boys
till
the
large
boys
ran
in
and
took
them
we
came
out
of
school
at
five
oclock
as
the
rule
is
upon
tuesdays
according
to
custom
we
drove
the
dayboys
in
brave
rout
down
the
causeway
from
the
schoolporch
even
to
the
gate
where
cop
has
his
dwelling
and
duty
little
it
recked
us
and
helped
them
less
that
they
were
our
founders
citizens
and
haply
his
own
grandnephews
for
he
left
no
direct
descendants
neither
did
we
much
inquire
what
their
lineage
was
for
it
had
long
been
fixed
among
us
who
were
of
the
house
and
chambers
that
these
same
dayboys
were
all
caddes
as
we
had
discovered
to
call
it
because
they
paid
no
groat
for
their
schooling
and
brought
their
own
commons
with
them
in
consumption
of
these
we
would
help
them
for
our
fare
in
hall
fed
appetite
and
while
we
ate
their
victuals
we
allowed
them
freely
to
talk
to
us
nevertheless
we
could
not
feel
when
all
the
victuals
were
gone
but
that
these
boys
required
kicking
from
the
premises
of
blundell
and
some
of
them
were
shopkeepers
sons
young
grocers
fellmongers
and
poulterers
and
these
to
their
credit
seemed
to
know
how
righteous
it
was
to
kick
them
but
others
were
of
high
family
as
any
need
be
in
devoncarews
and
bouchiers
and
bastards
and
some
of
these
would
turn
sometimes
and
strike
the
boy
that
kicked
them
but
to
do
them
justice
even
these
knew
that
they
must
be
kicked
for
not
paying
after
these
charityboys
were
gone
as
in
contumely
we
called
themif
you
break

bag
on

head
said

how

thence
tomorrowand
after
old
cop
with
clang
of
iron
had
jammed
the
double
gates
in
under
the
scruffstone
archway
whereupon
are
latin
verses
done
in
brass
of
small
quality
some
of
us
who
were
not
hungry
and
cared
not
for
the
supperbell
having
sucked
much
parliament
and
dumps
at
my
only
chargesnot
that
i
ever
bore
much
wealth
but
because
i
had
been
thrifting
it
for
this
time
of
my
birthwe
were
leaning
quite
at
dusk
against
the
iron
bars
of
the
gate
some
six
or
it
may
be
seven
of
us
small
boys
all
and
not
conspicuous
in
the
closing
of
the
daylight
and
the
fog
that
came
at
eventide
else
cop
would
have
rated
us
up
the
green
for
he
was
churly
to
little
boys
when
his
wife
had
taken
their
money
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
all
of
us
for
the
gate
will
hold
nine
boys
closepacked
unless
they
be
fed
rankly
whereof
is
little
danger
and
now
we
were
looking
out
on
the
road
and
wishing
we
could
get
there
hoping
moreover
to
see
a
good
string
of
packhorses
come
by
with
troopers
to
protect
them
for
the
dayboys
had
brought
us
word
that
some
intending
their
way
to
the
town
had
lain
that
morning
at
sampford
peveril
and
must
be
in
ere
nightfall
because
mr
faggus
was
after
them
now
mr
faggus
was
my
first
cousin
and
an
honour
to
the
family
being
a
northmolton
man
of
great
renown
on
the
highway
from
barum
town
even
to
london
therefore
of
course
i
hoped
that
he
would
catch
the
packmen
and
the
boys
were
asking
my
opinion
as
of
an
oracle
about
it
a
certain
boy
leaning
up
against
me
would
not
allow
my
elbow
room
and
struck
me
very
sadly
in
the
stomach
part
though
his
own
was
full
of
my
parliament
and
this
i
felt
so
unkindly
that
i
smote
him
straightway
in
the
face
without
tarrying
to
consider
it
or
weighing
the
question
duly
upon
this
he
put
his
head
down
and
presented
it
so
vehemently
at
the
middle
of
my
waistcoat
that
for
a
minute
or
more
my
breath
seemed
dropped
as
it
were
from
my
pockets
and
my
life
seemed
to
stop
from
great
want
of
ease
before
i
came
to
myself
again
it
had
been
settled
for
us
that
we
should
move
to
the
ironingbox
as
the
triangle
of
turf
is
called
where
the
two
causeways
coming
from
the
schoolporch
and
the
hallporch
meet
and
our
fights
are
mainly
celebrated
only
we
must
wait
until
the
convoy
of
horses
had
passed
and
then
make
a
ring
by
candlelight
and
the
other
boys
would
like
it
but
suddenly
there
came
round
the
post
where
the
letters
of
our
founder
are
not
from
the
way
of
taunton
but
from
the
side
of
lowman
bridge
a
very
small
string
of
horses
only
two
indeed
counting
for

pony
and
a
redfaced

of

john
fry
leaned
forward
in
the
saddle
and
turned
his
eyes
away
from
me
and
then
there
was
a
noise
in
his
throat
like
a
snail
crawling
on
a
windowpane
oh

he
checked
himself
suddenly
and
frightened

well
and

and

the

to

at

end
of

season
he
looked
at
the
nags
ears
as
he
said
it
and
being
up
to
john
frys
ways
i
knew
that
it
was
a
lie
and
my
heart
fell
like
a
lump
of
lead
and
i
leaned
back
on
the
stay
of
the
gate
and
longed
no
more
to
fight
anybody
a
sort
of
dull
power
hung
over
me
like
the
cloud
of
a
brooding
tempest
and
i
feared
to
be
told
anything
i
did
not
even
care
to
stroke
the
nose
of
my
pony
peggy
although
she
pushed
it
in
through
the
rails
where
a
square
of
broader
lattice
is
and
sniffed
at
me
and
began
to
crop
gently
after
my
fingers
but
whatever
lives
or
dies
business
must
be
attended
to
and
the
principal
business
of
good
christians
is
beyond
all
controversy
to
fight
with
one
another
come
up
jack
said
one
of
the
boys
lifting
me
under
the
chin
he
hit
you
and
you
hit
him
you
know
pay
your
debts
before
you
go
said
a
monitor
striding
up
to
me
after
hearing
how
the
honour
lay
ridd
you
must
go
through
with
it
fight
for
the
sake
of
the
junior
first
cried
the
little
fellow
in
my
ear
the
clever
one
the
head
of
our
class
who
had
mocked
john
fry
and
knew
all
about
the
aorists
and
tried
to
make
me
know
it
but
i
never
went
more
than
three
places
up
and
then
it
was
an
accident
and
i
came
down
after
dinner
the
boys
were
urgent
round
me
to
fight
though
my
stomach
was
not
up
for
it
and
being
very
slow
of
wit
which
is
not
chargeable
on
me
i
looked
from
one
to
other
of
them
seeking
any
cure
for
it
not
that
i
was
afraid
of
fighting
for
now
i
had
been
three
years
at
blundells
and
foughten
all
that
time
a
fight
at
least
once
every
week
till
the
boys
began
to
know
me
only
that
the
load
on
my
heart
was
not
sprightly
as
of
the
hayfield
it
is
a
very
sad
thing
to
dwell
on
but
even
now
in
my
time
of
wisdom
i
doubt
it
is
a
fond
thing
to
imagine
and
a
motherly
to
insist
upon
that
boys
can
do
without
fighting
unless
they
be
very
good
boys
and
afraid
of
one
another
nay
i
said
with
my
back
against
the
wroughtiron
stay
of
the
gate
which
was
socketed
into
cops
housefront
i
will
not
fight
thee
now
robin
snell
but
wait
till
i
come
back
again
take
cowards
blow
jack
ridd
then
cried
half
a
dozen
little
boys
shoving
bob
snell
forward
to
do
it
because
they
all
knew
well
enough
having
striven
with
me
ere
now
and
proved
me
to
be
their
masterthey
knew
i
say
that
without
great
change
i
would
never
accept
that
contumely
but
i
took
little
heed
of
them
looking
in
dull
wonderment
at
john
fry
and
smiler
and
the
blunderbuss
and
peggy
john
fry
was
scratching
his
head
i
could
see
and
getting
blue
in
the
face
by
the
light
from
cops
parlourwindow
and
going
to
and
fro
upon
smiler
as
if
he
were
hard
set
with
it
and
all
the
time
he
was
looking
briskly
from
my
eyes
to
the
fist
i
was
clenching
and
methought
he
tried
to
wink
at
me
in
a
covert
manner
and
then
peggy
whisked
her
tail
shall
i
fight
john
i
said
at
last
i
would

not

he
answered
in
a
whisper
through
the
gridiron
of
the
gate

he
looked
doubtfully
down
at
the
colour
of
his
cowskin
boots
and
the
mire
upon
the
horses
for
the
sloughs
were
exceedingly
mucky
peggy
indeed
my
sorrel
pony
being
lighter
of
weight
was
not
crusted
much
over
the
shoulders
but
smiler
our
youngest
sledder
had
been
well
in
over
his
withers
and
none
would
have
deemed
him
a
piebald
save
of
red
mire
and
black
mire
the
great
blunderbuss
moreover
was
choked
with
a
dollop
of

sadcoloured
sunday
hat
was
indued
with
a
plume
of
marishweed
all
this
i
saw
while
he
was
dismounting
heavily
and
wearily
lifting
his
leg
from
the
saddlecloth
as
if
with
a
sore
crick
in
his
back
by
this
time
the
question
of
fighting
was
gone
quite
out
of
our
discretion
for
sundry
of
the
elder
boys
grave
and
reverend
signors
who
had
taken
no
small
pleasure
in
teaching
our
hands
to
fight
to
ward
to
parry
to
feign
and
counter
to
lunge
in
the
manner
of
swordplay
and
the
weaker
child
to
drop
on
one
knee
when
no
cunning
of
fence
might
baffle
the
onsetthese
great
masters
of
the
art
who
would
far
liefer
see
us
little
ones
practise
it
than
themselves
engage
six
or
seven
of
them
came
running
down
the
rounded
causeway
having
heard
that
there
had
arisen
a
snug
little
mill
at
the
gate
now
whether
that
word
hath
origin
in
a
greek
term
meaning
a
conflict
as
the
bestread
boys
asseverated
or
whether
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
figure
of
similitude
from
the
beating
arms
of
a
mill
such
as
i
have
seen
in
counties
where
are
no
waterbrooks
but
folk
make
bread
with
windit
is
not
for
a
man
devoid
of
scholarship
to
determine
enough
that
they
who
made
the
ring
intituled
the
scene
a
mill
while
we
who
must
be
thumped
inside
it
tried
to
rejoice
in
their
pleasantry
till
it
turned
upon
the
stomach
moreover
i
felt
upon
me
now
a
certain
responsibility
a
dutiful
need
to
maintain
in
the
presence
of
john
fry
the
manliness
of
the
ridd
family
and
the
honour
of
exmoor
hitherto
none
had
worsted
me
although
in
the
three
years
of
my
schooling
i
had
fought
more
than
threescore
battles
and
bedewed
with
blood
every
plant
of
grass
towards
the
middle
of
the
ironingbox
and
this
success
i
owed
at
first
to
no
skill
of
my
own
until
i
came
to
know
better
for
up
to
twenty
or
thirty
fights
i
struck
as
nature
guided
me
no
wiser
than
a
fatherlonglegs
in
the
heat
of
a
lanthorn
but
i
had
conquered
partly
through
my
native
strength
and
the
exmoor
toughness
in
me
and
still
more
that
i
could
not
see
when
i
had
gotten
my
bellyful
but
now
i
was
like
to
have
that
and
more
for
my
heart
was
down
to
begin
with
and
then
robert
snell
was
a
bigger
boy
than
i
had
ever
encountered
and
as
thick
in
the
skull
and
hard
in
the
brain
as
even
i
could
claim
to
be
i
had
never
told
my
mother
a
word
about
these
frequent
strivings
because
she
was
softhearted
neither
had
i
told
by
father
because
he
had
not
seen
it
therefore
beholding
me
still
an
innocentlooking
child
with
fair
curls
on
my
forehead
and
no
store
of
bad
language
john
fry
thought
this
was
the
very
first
fight
that
ever
had
befallen
me
and
so
when
they
let
him
at
the
gate
with
a
message
to
the
headmaster
as
one
of
the
monitors
told
cop
and
peggy
and
smiler
were
tied
to
the
railings
till
i
should
be
through
my
business
john
comes
up
to
me
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
and
says
doont
thee
goo
for
to
do
it
jan
doont
thee
do
it
for
gude
now
but
i
told
him
that
now
it
was
much
too
late
to
cry
off
so
he
said
the
lord
be
with
thee
jan
and
turn
thy
thumbknuckle
inwards
it
was
not
a
very
large
piece
of
ground
in
the
angle
of
the
causeways
but
quite
big
enough
to
fight
upon
especially
for
christians
who
loved
to
be
cheek
by
jowl
at
it
the
great
boys
stood
in
a
circle
around
being
gifted
with
strong
privilege
and
the
little
boys
had
leave
to
lie
flat
and
look
through
the
legs
of
the
great
boys
but
while
we
were
yet
preparing
and
the
candles
hissed
in
the
fogcloud
old
phoebe
of
more
than
fourscore
years
whose
room
was
over
the
hallporch
came
hobbling
out
as
she
always
did
to
mar
the
joy
of
the
conflict
no
one
ever
heeded
her
neither
did
she
expect
it
but
the
evil
was
that
two
senior
boys
must
always
lose
the
first
round
of
the
fight
by
having
to
lead
her
home
again
i
marvel
how
robin
snell
felt
very
likely
he
thought
nothing
of
it
always
having
been
a
boy
of
a
hectoring
and
unruly
sort
but
i
felt
my
heart
go
up
and
down
as
the
boys
came
round
to
strip
me
and
greatly
fearing
to
be
beaten
i
blew
hot
upon
my
knuckles
then
pulled
i
off
my
little
cut
jerkin
and
laid
it
down
on
my
head
cap
and
over
that
my
waistcoat
and
a
boy
was
proud
to
take
care
of
them
thomas
hooper
was
his
name
and
i
remember
how
he
looked
at
me
my
mother
had
made
that
little
cut
jerkin
in
the
quiet
winter
evenings
and
taken
pride
to
loop
it
up
in
a
fashionable
way
and
i
was
loth
to
soil
it
with
blood
and
good
filberds
were
in
the
pocket
then
up
to
me
came
robin
snell
mayor
of
exeter
thrice
since
that
and
he
stood
very
square
and
looking
at
me
and
i
lacked
not
long
to
look
at
him
round
his
waist
he
had
a
kerchief
busking
up
his
smallclothes
and
on
his
feet
light
pumpkin
shoes
and
all
his
upper
raiment
off
and
he
danced
about
in
a
way
that
made
my
head
swim
on
my
shoulders
and
he
stood
some
inches
over
me
but
i
being
muddled
with
much
doubt
about
john
fry
and
his
errand
was
only
stripped
of
my
jerkin
and
waistcoat
and
not
comfortable
to
begin
come
now
shake
hands
cried
a
big
boy
jumping
in
joy
of
the
spectacle
a
thirdformer
nearly
six
feet
high
shake
hands
you
little
devils
keep
your
pluck
up
and
show
good
sport
and
lord
love
the
better
man
of
you
robin
took
me
by
the
hand
and
gazed
at
me
disdainfully
and
then
smote
me
painfully
in
the
face
ere
i
could
get
my
fence
up
whutt
be
bout
lad
cried
john
fry
hutt
un
again
jan
wull
e
well
done
then
our
jan
boy
for
i
had
replied
to
robin
now
with
all
the
weight
and
cadence
of
penthemimeral
caesura
a
thing
the
name
of
which
i
know
but
could
never
make
head
nor
tail
of
it
and
the
strife
began
in
a
serious
style
and
the
boys
looking
on
were
not
cheated
although
i
could
not
collect
their
shouts
when
the
blows
were
ringing
upon
me
it
was
no
great
loss
for
john
fry
told
me
afterwards
that
their
oaths
went
up
like
a
furnace
fire
but
to
these
we
paid
no
heed
or
hap
being
in
the
thick
of
swinging
and
devoid
of
judgment
all
i
know
is
i
came
to
my
corner
when
the
round
was
over
with
very
hard
pumps
in
my
chest
and
a
great
desire
to
fall
away
time
is
up
cried
headmonitor
ere
ever
i
got
my
breath
again
and
when
i
fain
would
have
lingered
awhile
on
the
knee
of
the
boy
that
held
me
john
fry
had
come
up
and
the
boys
were
laughing
because
he
wanted
a
stable
lanthorn
and
threatened
to
tell
my
mother
time
is
up
cried
another
boy
more
headlong
than
headmonitor
if
we
count
three
before
the
come
of
thee
thwacked
thou
art
and
must
go
to
the
women
i
felt
it
hard
upon
me
he
began
to
count
one
too
threebut
before
the
three
was
out
of
his
mouth
i
was
facing
my
foe
with
both
hands
up
and
my
breath
going
rough
and
hot
and
resolved
to
wait
the
turn
of
it
for
i
had
found
seat
on
the
knee
of
a
boy
sage
and
skilled
to
tutor
me
who
knew
how
much
the
end
very
often
differs
from
the
beginning
a
rare
ripe
scholar
he
was
and
now
he
hath
routed
up
the
germans
in
the
matter
of
criticism
sure
the
clever
boys
and
men
have
most
love
towards
the
stupid
ones
finish
him
off
bob
cried
a
big
boy
and
that
i
noticed
especially
because
i
thought
it
unkind
of
him
after
eating
of
my
toffee
as
he
had
that
afternoon
finish
him
off
neck
and
crop
he
deserves
it
for
sticking
up
to
a
man
like
you
but
i
was
not
so
to
be
finished
off
though
feeling
in
my
knuckles
now
as
if
it
were
a
blueness
and
a
sense
of
chilblain
nothing
held
except
my
legs
and
they
were
good
to
help
me
so
this
bout
or
round
if
you
please
was
foughten
warily
by
me
with
gentle
recollection
of
what
my
tutor
the
clever
boy
had
told
me
and
some
resolve
to
earn
his
praise
before
i
came
back
to
his
knee
again
and
never
i
think
in
all
my
life
sounded
sweeter
words
in
my
ears
except
when
my
love
loved
me
than
when
my
second
and
backer
who
had
made
himself
part
of
my
doings
now
and
would
have
wept
to
see
me
beaten
said
famously
done
jack
famously
only
keep
your
wind
up
jack
and
youll
go
right
through
him
meanwhile
john
fry
was
prowling
about
asking
the
boys
what
they
thought
of
it
and
whether
i
was
like
to
be
killed
because
of
my
mothers
trouble
but
finding
now
that
i
had
foughten
threescore
fights
already
he
came
up
to
me
woefully
in
the
quickness
of
my
breathing
while
i
sat
on
the
knee
of
my
second
with
a
piece
of
spongious
coralline
to
ease
me
of
my
bloodshed
and
he
says
in
my
ears
as
if
he
was
clapping
spurs
into
a
horse
never
thee
knack
under
jan
or
never
coom
naigh
hexmoor
no
more
with
that
it
was
all
up
with
me
a
simmering
buzzed
in
my
heavy
brain
and
a
light
came
through
my
eyeplaces
at
once
i
set
both
fists
again
and
my
heart
stuck
to
me
like
cobblers
wax
either
robin
snell
should
kill
me
or
i
would
conquer
robin
snell
so
i
went
in
again
with
my
courage
up
and
bob
came
smiling
for
victory
and
i
hated
him
for
smiling
he
let
at
me
with
his
left
hand
and
i
gave
him
my
right
between
his
eyes
and
he
blinked
and
was
not
pleased
with
it
i
feared
him
not
and
spared
him
not
neither
spared
myself
my
breath
came
again
and
my
heart
stood
cool
and
my
eyes
struck
fire
no
longer
only
i
knew
that
i
would
die
sooner
than
shame
my
birthplace
how
the
rest
of
it
was
i
know
not
only
that
i
had
the
end
of
it
and
helped
to
put
robin
in
bed
chapter
iii
the
warpath
of
the
doones
from
tiverton
town
to
the
town
of
oare
is
a
very
long
and
painful
road
and
in
good
truth
the
traveller
must
make
his
way
as
the
saying
is
for
the
way
is
still
unmade
at
least
on
this
side
of
dulverton
although
there
is
less
danger
now
than
in
the
time
of
my
schooling
for
now
a
good
horse
may
go
there
without
much
cost
of
leaping
but
when
i
was
a
boy
the
spurs
would
fail
when
needed
most
by
reason
of
the
sloughcake
it
is
to
the
credit
of
this
age
and
our
advance
upon
fatherly
ways
that
now
we
have
laid
down
rods
and
fagots
and
even
stumpoaks
here
and
there
so
that
a
man
in
good
daylight
need
not
sink
if
he
be
quite
sober
there
is
nothing
i
have
striven
at
more
than
doing
my
duty
waywarden
over
exmoor
but
in
those
days
when
i
came
from
school
and
good
times
they
were
too
full
of
a
warmth
and
fine
hearthcomfort
which
now
are
dying
out
it
was
a
sad
and
sorry
business
to
find
where
lay
the
highway
we
are
taking
now
to
mark
it
off
with
a
fence
on
either
side
at
least
when
a
town
is
handy
but
to
me
this
seems
of
a
high
pretence
and
a
sort
of
landmark
and
channel
for
robbers
though
well
enough
near
london
where
they
have
earned
a
racecourse
we
left
the
town
of
the
two
fords
which
they
say
is
the
meaning
of
it
very
early
in
the
morning
after
lying
one
day
to
rest
as
was
demanded
by
the
nags
sore
of
foot
and
foundered
for
my
part
too
i
was
glad
to
rest
having
aches
all
over
me
and
very
heavy
bruises
and
we
lodged
at
the
sign
of
the
white
horse
inn
in
the
street
called
gold
street
opposite
where
the
souls
are
of
john
and
joan
greenway
set
up
in
gold
letters
because
we
must
take
the
homeward
way
at
cockcrow
of
the
morning
though
still
john
fry
was
dry
with
me
of
the
reason
of
his
coming
and
only
told
lies
about
father
and
could
not
keep
them
agreeable
i
hoped
for
the
best
as
all
boys
will
especially
after
a
victory
and
i
thought
perhaps
father
had
sent
for
me
because
he
had
a
good
harvest
and
the
rats
were
bad
in
the
cornchamber
it
was
high
noon
before
we
were
got
to
dulverton
that
day
near
to
which
town
the
river
exe
and
its
big
brother
barle
have
union
my
mother
had
an
uncle
living
there
but
we
were
not
to
visit
his
house
this
time
at
which
i
was
somewhat
astonished
since
we
needs
must
stop
for
at
least
two
hours
to
bait
our
horses
thorough
well
before
coming
to
the
black
bogway
the
bogs
are
very
good
in
frost
except
where
the
hotsprings
rise
but
as
yet
there
had
been
no
frost
this
year
save
just
enough
to
make
the
blackbirds
look
big
in
the
morning
in
a
hearty
blackfrost
they
look
small
until
the
snow
falls
over
them
the
road
from
bampton
to
dulverton
had
not
been
very
delicate
yet
nothing
to
complain
of
muchno
deeper
indeed
than
the
hocks
of
a
horse
except
in
the
rotten
places
the
day
was
inclined
to
be
mild
and
foggy
and
both
nags
sweated
freely
but
peggy
carrying
little
weight
for
my
wardrobe
was
upon
smiler
and
john
fry
grumbling
always
we
could
easily
keep
in
front
as
far
as
you
may
hear
a
laugh
john
had
been
rather
bitter
with
me
which
methought
was
a
mark
of
ill
taste
at
coming
home
for
the
holidays
and
yet
i
made
allowance
for
john
because
he
had
never
been
at
school
and
never
would
have
chance
to
eat
fry
upon
condition
of
spelling
it
therefore
i
rode
on
thinking
that
he
was
hardset
like
a
saw
for
his
dinner
and
would
soften
after
toothwork
and
yet
at
his
most
hungry
times
when
his
mind
was
far
gone
upon
bacon
certes
he
seemed
to
check
himself
and
look
at
me
as
if
he
were
sorry
for
little
things
coming
over
great
but
now
at
dulverton
we
dined
upon
the
rarest
and
choicest
victuals
that
ever
i
did
taste
even
now
at
my
time
of
life
to
think
of
it
gives
me
appetite
as
once
and
awhile
to
think
of
my
first
love
makes
me
love
all
goodness
hot
mutton
pasty
was
a
thing
i
had
often
heard
of
from
very
wealthy
boys
and
men
who
made
a
dessert
of
dinner
and
to
hear
them
talk
of
it
made
my
lips
smack
and
my
ribs
come
inwards
and
now
john
fry
strode
into
the
hostel
with
the
air
and
grace
of
a
shortlegged
man
and
shouted
as
loud
as
if
he
was
calling
sheep
upon
exmoor
hot
mooton
pasty
for
twoo
trarvlers
at
number
vaive
in
vaive
minnits
dish
un
up
in
the
tin
with
the
grahvy
zame
as
i
hardered
last
tuesday
of
course
it
did
not
come
in
five
minutes
nor
yet
in
ten
or
twenty
but
that
made
it
all
the
better
when
it
came
to
the
real
presence
and
the
smell
of
it
was
enough
to
make
an
empty
man
thank
god
for
the
room
there
was
inside
him
fifty
years
have
passed
me
quicker
than
the
taste
of
that
gravy
it
is
the
manner
of
all
good
boys
to
be
careless
of
apparel
and
take
no
pride
in
adornment
good
lack
if
i
see
a
boy
make
to
do
about
the
fit
of
his
crumpler
and
the
creasing
of
his
breeches
and
desire
to
be
shod
for
comeliness
rather
than
for
use
i
cannot
scape
the
mark
that
god
took
thought
to
make
a
girl
of
him
not
so
when
they
grow
older
and
court
the
regard
of
the
maidens
then
may
the
bravery
pass
from
the
inside
to
the
outside
of
them
and
no
bigger
fools
are
they
even
then
than
their
fathers
were
before
them
but
god
forbid
any
man
to
be
a
fool
to
love
and
be
loved
as
i
have
been
else
would
he
have
prevented
it
when
the
mutton
pasty
was
done
and
peggy
and
smiler
had
dined
well
also
out
i
went
to
wash
at
the
pump
being
a
lover
of
soap
and
water
at
all
risk
except
of
my
dinner
and
john
fry
who
cared
very
little
to
wash
save
sabbath
days
in
his
own
soap
and
who
had
kept
me
from
the
pump
by
threatening
loss
of
the
dish
out
he
came
in
a
satisfied
manner
with
a
piece
of
quill
in
his
hand
to
lean
against
a
doorpost
and
listen
to
the
horses
feeding
and
have
his
teeth
ready
for
supper
then
a
ladysmaid
came
out
and
the
sun
was
on
her
face
and
she
turned
round
to
go
back
again
but
put
a
better
face
upon
it
and
gave
a
trip
and
hitched
her
dress
and
looked
at
the
sun
full
body
lest
the
hostlers
should
laugh
that
she
was
losing
her
complexion
with
a
long
italian
glass
in
her
fingers
very
daintily
she
came
up
to
the
pump
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
where
i
was
running
the
water
off
all
my
head
and
shoulders
and
arms
and
some
of
my
breast
even
and
though
i
had
glimpsed
her
through
the
sprinkle
it
gave
me
quite
a
turn
to
see
her
child
as
i
was
in
my
open
aspect
but
she
looked
at
me
no
whit
abashed
making
a
baby
of
me
no
doubt
as
a
woman
of
thirty
will
do
even
with
a
very
big
boy
when
they
catch
him
on
a
hayrick
and
she
said
to
me
in
a
brazen
manner
as
if
i
had
been
nobody
while
i
was
shrinking
behind
the
pump
and
craving
to
get
my
shirt
on
good
leetle
boy
come
hither
to
me
fine
heaven
how
blue
your
eyes
are
and
your
skin
like
snow
but
some
naughty
man
has
beaten
it
black
oh
leetle
boy
let
me
feel
it
ah
how
then
it
must
have
hurt
you
there
now
and
you
shall
love
me
all
this
time
she
was
touching
my
breast
here
and
there
very
lightly
with
her
delicate
brown
fingers
and
i
understood
from
her
voice
and
manner
that
she
was
not
of
this
country
but
a
foreigner
by
extraction
and
then
i
was
not
so
shy
of
her
because
i
could
talk
better
english
than
she
and
yet
i
longed
for
my
jerkin
but
liked
not
to
be
rude
to
her
if
you
please
madam
i
must
go
john
fry
is
waiting
by
the
tapsters
door
and
peggy
neighing
to
me
if
you
please
we
must
get
home
tonight
and
father
will
be
waiting
for
me
this
side
of
the
tellinghouse
there
there
you
shall
go
leetle
dear
and
perhaps
i
will
go
after
you
i
have
taken
much
love
of
you
but
the
baroness
is
hard
to
me
how
far
you
call
it
now
to
the
bank
of
the
sea
at
washwash
at
watchett
likely
you
mean
madam
oh
a
very
long
way
and
the
roads
as
soft
as
the
road
to
oare
ohah
ohahi
shall
remember
that
is
the
place
where
my
leetle
boy
live
and
some
day
i
will
come
seek
for
him
now
make
the
pump
to
flow
my
dear
and
give
me
the
good
water
the
baroness
will
not
touch
unless
a
nebule
be
formed
outside
the
glass
i
did
not
know
what
she
meant
by
that
yet
i
pumped
for
her
very
heartily
and
marvelled
to
see
her
for
fifty
times
throw
the
water
away
in
the
trough
as
if
it
was
not
good
enough
at
last
the
water
suited
her
with
a
likeness
of
fog
outside
the
glass
and
the
gleam
of
a
crystal
under
it
and
then
she
made
a
curtsey
to
me
in
a
sort
of
mocking
manner
holding
the
long
glass
by
the
foot
not
to
take
the
cloud
off
and
then
she
wanted
to
kiss
me
but
i
was
out
of
breath
and
have
always
been
shy
of
that
work
except
when
i
come
to
offer
it
and
so
i
ducked
under
the
pumphandle
and
she
knocked
her
chin
on
the
knob
of
it
and
the
hostlers
came
out
and
asked
whether
they
would
do
as
well
upon
this
she
retreated
up
the
yard
with
a
certain
dark
dignity
and
a
foreign
way
of
walking
which
stopped
them
at
once
from
going
farther
because
it
was
so
different
from
the
fashion
of
their
sweethearts
one
with
another
they
hung
back
where
half
a
cartload
of
hay
was
and
they
looked
to
be
sure
that
she
would
not
turn
round
and
then
each
one
laughed
at
the
rest
of
them
now
up
to
the
end
of
dulverton
town
on
the
northward
side
of
it
where
the
two
new
pigsties
be
the
oare
folk
and
the
watchett
folk
must
trudge
on
together
until
we
come
to
a
broken
cross
where
a
murdered
man
lies
buried
peggy
and
smiler
went
up
the
hill
as
if
nothing
could
be
too
much
for
them
after
the
beans
they
had
eaten
and
suddenly
turning
a
corner
of
trees
we
happened
upon
a
great
coach
and
six
horses
labouring
very
heavily
john
fry
rode
on
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
as
became
him
towards
the
quality
but
i
was
amazed
to
that
degree
that
i
left
my
cap
on
my
head
and
drew
bridle
without
knowing
it
for
in
the
front
seat
of
the
coach
which
was
halfway
open
being
of
the
citymake
and
the
day
in
want
of
air
sate
the
foreign
lady
who
had
met
me
at
the
pump
and
offered
to
salute
me
by
her
side
was
a
little
girl
darkhaired
and
very
wonderful
with
a
wealthy
softness
on
her
as
if
she
must
have
her
own
way
i
could
not
look
at
her
for
two
glances
and
she
did
not
look
at
me
for
one
being
such
a
little
child
and
busy
with
the
hedges
but
in
the
honourable
place
sate
a
handsome
lady
very
warmly
dressed
and
sweetly
delicate
of
colour
and
close
to
her
was
a
lively
child
two
or
it
may
be
three
years
old
bearing
a
white
cockade
in
his
hat
and
staring
at
all
and
everybody
now
he
saw
peggy
and
took
such
a
liking
to
her
that
the
lady
his
motherif
so
she
werewas
forced
to
look
at
my
pony
and
me
and
to
tell
the
truth
although
i
am
not
of
those
who
adore
the
high
folk
she
looked
at
us
very
kindly
and
with
a
sweetness
rarely
found
in
the
women
who
milk
the
cows
for
us
then
i
took
off
my
cap
to
the
beautiful
lady
without
asking
wherefore
and
she
put
up
her
hand
and
kissed
it
to
me
thinking
perhaps
that
i
looked
like
a
gentle
and
good
little
boy
for
folk
always
called
me
innocent
though
god
knows
i
never
was
that
but
now
the
foreign
lady
or
ladys
maid
as
it
might
be
who
had
been
busy
with
little
dark
eyes
turned
upon
all
this
goingon
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
i
was
about
to
salute
her
at
a
distance
indeed
and
not
with
the
nicety
she
had
offered
to
me
but
strange
to
say
she
stared
at
my
eyes
as
if
she
had
never
seen
me
before
neither
wished
to
see
me
again
at
this
i
was
so
startled
such
things
beings
out
of
my
knowledge
that
i
startled
peggy
also
with
the
muscle
of
my
legs
and
she
being
fresh
from
stable
and
the
mire
scraped
off
with
caskhoop
broke
away
so
suddenly
that
i
could
do
no
more
than
turn
round
and
lower
my
cap
now
five
months
old
to
the
beautiful
lady
soon
i
overtook
john
fry
and
asked
him
all
about
them
and
how
it
was
that
we
had
missed
their
starting
from
the
hostel
but
john
would
never
talk
much
till
after
a
gallon
of
cider
and
all
that
i
could
win
out
of
him
was
that
they
were
murdering
papishers
and
little
he
cared
to
do
with
them
or
the
devil
as
they
came
from
and
a
good
thing
for
me
and
a
providence
that
i
was
gone
down
dulverton
town
to
buy
sweetstuff
for
annie
else
my
stupid
head
would
have
gone
astray
with
their
great
outcoming
we
saw
no
more
of
them
after
that
but
turned
into
the
sideway
and
soon
had
the
fill
of
our
hands
and
eyes
to
look
to
our
own
going
for
the
road
got
worse
and
worse
until
there
was
none
at
all
and
perhaps
the
purest
thing
it
could
do
was
to
be
ashamed
to
show
itself
but
we
pushed
on
as
best
we
might
with
doubt
of
reaching
home
any
time
except
by
special
grace
of
god
the
fog
came
down
upon
the
moors
as
thick
as
ever
i
saw
it
and
there
was
no
sound
of
any
sort
nor
a
breath
of
wind
to
guide
us
the
little
stubby
trees
that
stand
here
and
there
like
bushes
with
a
wooden
leg
to
them
were
drizzled
with
a
mess
of
wet
and
hung
their
points
with
dropping
wherever
the
buttend
of
a
hedgerow
came
up
from
the
hollow
ground
like
the
withers
of
a
horse
holes
of
splash
were
pocked
and
pimpled
in
the
yellow
sand
of
coneys
or
under
the
dwarf
trees
ovens
but
soon
it
was
too
dark
to
see
that
or
anything
else
i
may
say
except
the
creases
in
the
dusk
where
prisoned
light
crept
up
the
valleys
after
awhile
even
that
was
gone
and
no
other
comfort
left
us
except
to
see
our
horses
heads
jogging
to
their
footsteps
and
the
dark
ground
pass
below
us
lighter
where
the
wet
was
and
then
the
splash
foot
after
foot
more
clever
than
we
can
do
it
and
the
orderly
jerk
of
the
tail
and
the
smell
of
what
a
horse
is
john
fry
was
bowing
forward
with
sleep
upon
his
saddle
and
now
i
could
no
longer
see
the
frizzle
of
wet
upon
his
beardfor
he
had
a
very
brave
one
of
a
bright
red
colour
and
trimmed
into
a
whaleoil
knot
because
he
was
newly
marriedalthough
that
comb
of
hair
had
been
a
subject
of
some
wonder
to
me
whether
i
in
gods
good
time
should
have
the
like
of
that
handsomely
set
with
shining
beads
small
above
and
large
below
from
the
weeping
of
the
heaven
but
still
i
could
see
the
jog
of
his
hata
sunday
hat
with
a
top
to
itand
some
of
his
shoulder
bowed
out
in
the
mist
so
that
one
could
say
hold
up
john
when
smiler
put
his
foot
in
mercy
of
god
where
be
us
now
said
john
fry
waking
suddenly
us
ought
to
have
passed
hold
hash
jan
zeen

on
the

ee
no

my
knowing
nor

nothing
save

a
vule
thee
must
be
then
jan
and
me
myzell
no
better
harken
lad
harken
we
drew
our
horses
up
and
listened
through
the
thickness
of
the
air
and
with
our
hands
laid
to
our
ears
at
first
there
was
nothing
to
hear
except
the
panting
of
the
horses
and
the
trickle
of
the
eaving
drops
from
our
headcovers
and
clothing
and
the
soft
sounds
of
the
lonely
night
that
make
us
feel
and
try
not
to
think
then
there
came
a
mellow
noise
very
low
and
mournsome
not
a
sound
to
be
afraid
of
but
to
long
to
know
the
meaning
with
a
soft
rise
of
the
hair
three
times
it
came
and
went
again
as
the
shaking
of
a
thread
might
pass
away
into
the
distance
and
then
i
touched
john
fry
to
know
that
there
was
something
near
me
doont
e
be
a
vule
jan
vaine
moozick
as
iver
i
eer

bless
the

a

god

the

pretty
quick
if
her
did
then
who
is
it
in
the
chains
john
i
felt
my
spirit
rise
as
i
asked
for
now
i
had
crossed
exmoor
so
often
as
to
hope
that
the
people
sometimes
deserved
it
and
think
that
it
might
be
a
lesson
to
the
rogues
who
unjustly
loved
the
mutton
they
were
never
born
to
but
of
course
they
were
born
to
hanging
when
they
set
themselves
so
high
it
be
nawbody
said
john
vor
us
to
make
a
fush
about

to
tother
zide
o
the
moor
and
come
staling

to
our
zide

his

for
him
to
be
hanged
lad
and
good
cess
to
his
soul
for
craikin
zo
so
the
sound
of
the
quiet
swinging
led
us
very
modestly
as
it
came
and
went
on
the
wind
loud
and
low
pretty
regularly
even
as
far
as
the
foot
of
the
gibbet
where
the
four
crossways
are
vamous
job
this
here
cried
john
looking
up
to
be
sure
of
it
because
there
were
so
many
here
be
my
own
nick

useful
goodnaight
to
thee
jem
my
lad
and
not
break
thy
drames
with
the
craikin
john
fry
shook
his
bridlearm
and
smote
upon
smiler
merrily
as
he
jogged
into
the
homeward
track
from
the
guiding
of
the
body
but
i
was
sorry
for
red
jem
and
wanted
to
know
more
about
him
and
whether
he
might
not
have
avoided
this
miserable
end
and
what
his
wife
and
children
thought
of
it
if
indeed
he
had
any
but
john
would
talk
no
more
about
it
and
perhaps
he
was
moved
with
a
lonesome
feeling
as
the
creaking
sound
came
after
us
hould
thee
tongue
lad
he
said
sharply
us
be
naigh
the
doonetrack
now
two
maile
from
dunkery
beacon
hill
the
haighest
place
of
hexmoor
so
happen
they
be
abroad
tonaight
us
must
crawl
on
our
bellyplaces
boy
i
knew
at
once
what
he
meantthose
bloody
doones
of
bagworthy
the
awe
of
all
devon
and
somerset
outlaws
traitors
murderers
my
little
legs
began
to
tremble
to
and
fro
upon
peggys
sides
as
i
heard
the
dead
robber
in
chains
behind
us
and
thought
of
the
live
ones
still
in
front
but
john
i
whispered
warily
sidling
close
to
his
saddlebow
dear
john
you
dont
think
they
will
see
us
in
such
a
fog
as
this
never
god
made
vog
as
could
stop
their
eyesen
he
whispered
in
answer
fearfully
here
us
be
by
the
hollow
ground
zober
lad
goo
zober
now
if
thee
wish
to
see
thy
moother
for
i
was
inclined
in
the
manner
of
boys
to
make
a
run
of
the
danger
and
cross
the
doonetrack
at
full
speed
to
rush
for
it
and
be
done
with
it
but
even
then
i
wondered
why
he
talked
of
my
mother
so
and
said
not
a
word
of
father
we
were
come
to
a
long
deep
goyal
as
they
call
it
on
exmoor
a
word
whose
fountain
and
origin
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
only
i
know
that
when
little
boys
laughed
at
me
at
tiverton
for
talking
about
a
goyal
a
big
boy
clouted
them
on
the
head
and
said
that
it
was
in
homer
and
meant
the
hollow
of
the
hand
and
another
time
a
welshman
told
me
that
it
must
be
something
like
the
thing
they
call
a
pant
in
those
parts
still
i
know
what
it
means
well
enoughto
wit
a
long
trough
among
wild
hills
falling
towards
the
plain
country
rounded
at
the
bottom
perhaps
and
stiff
more
than
steep
at
the
sides
of
it
whether
it
be
straight
or
crooked
makes
no
difference
to
it
we
rode
very
carefully
down
our
side
and
through
the
soft
grass
at
the
bottom
and
all
the
while
we
listened
as
if
the
air
was
a
speakingtrumpet
then
gladly
we
breasted
our
nags
to
the
rise
and
were
coming
to
the
comb
of
it
when
i
heard
something
and
caught
johns
arm
and
he
bent
his
hand
to
the
shape
of
his
ear
it
was
the
sound
of
horses
feet
knocking
up
through
splashy
ground
as
if
the
bottom
sucked
them
then
a
grunting
of
weary
men
and
the
lifting
noise
of
stirrups
and
sometimes
the
clank
of
iron
mixed
with
the
wheezy
croning
of
leather
and
the
blowing
of
hairy
nostrils
gods
sake
jack
slip
round
her
belly
and
let
her
go
where
she
wull
as
john
fry
whispered
so
i
did
for
he
was
off
smiler
by
this
time
but
our
two
pads
were
too
fagged
to
go
far
and
began
to
nose
about
and
crop
sniffing
more
than
they
need
have
done
i
crept
to
johns
side
very
softly
with
the
bridle
on
my
arm
let
goo
braidle
let
goo
lad
plaise
god
they
take
them
for
forestponies
or
theyll
zend
a
bullet
through
us
i
saw
what
he
meant
and
let
go
the
bridle
for
now
the
mist
was
rolling
off
and
we
were
against
the
skyline
to
the
dark
cavalcade
below
us
john
lay
on
the
ground
by
a
barrow
of
heather
where
a
little
gullet
was
and
i
crept
to
him
afraid
of
the
noise
i
made
in
dragging
my
legs
along
and
the
creak
of
my
cord
breeches
john
bleated
like
a
sheep
to
cover
ita
sheep
very
cold
and
trembling
then
just
as
the
foremost
horseman
passed
scarce
twenty
yards
below
us
a
puff
of
wind
came
up
the
glen
and
the
fog
rolled
off
before
it
and
suddenly
a
strong
red
light
cast
by
the
cloudweight
downwards
spread
like
fingers
over
the
moorland
opened
the
alleys
of
darkness
and
hung
on
the
steel
of
the
riders
dunkery
beacon
whispered
john
so
close
into
my
ear
that
i
felt
his
lips
and
teeth
ashake
dursnt
fire
it
now
except
to
show
the
doones
way
home
again
since
the
naight
as
they
went
up
and
throwed
the
watchmen
atop
of
it
why
wutt
be
bout
lad
gods
sake
for
i
could
keep
still
no
longer
but
wriggled
away
from
his
arm
and
along
the
little
gullet
still
going
flat
on
my
breast
and
thighs
until
i
was
under
a
grey
patch
of
stone
with
a
fringe
of
dry
fern
round
it
there
i
lay
scarce
twenty
feet
above
the
heads
of
the
riders
and
i
feared
to
draw
my
breath
though
prone
to
do
it
with
wonder
for
now
the
beacon
was
rushing
up
in
a
fiery
storm
to
heaven
and
the
form
of
its
flame
came
and
went
in
the
folds
and
the
heavy
sky
was
hovering
all
around
it
was
hung
with
red
deep
in
twisted
columns
and
then
a
giant
beard
of
fire
streamed
throughout
the
darkness
the
sullen
hills
were
flanked
with
light
and
the
valleys
chined
with
shadow
and
all
the
sombrous
moors
between
awoke
in
furrowed
anger
but
most
of
all
the
flinging
fire
leaped
into
the
rocky
mouth
of
the
glen
below
me
where
the
horsemen
passed
in
silence
scarcely
deigning
to
look
round
heavy
men
and
large
of
stature
reckless
how
they
bore
their
guns
or
how
they
sate
their
horses
with
leathern
jerkins
and
long
boots
and
iron
plates
on
breast
and
head
plunder
heaped
behind
their
saddles
and
flagons
slung
in
front
of
them
i
counted
more
than
thirty
pass
like
clouds
upon
red
sunset
some
had
carcasses
of
sheep
swinging
with
their
skins
on
others
had
deer
and
one
had
a
child
flung
across
his
saddlebow
whether
the
child
were
dead
or
alive
was
more
than
i
could
tell
only
it
hung
head
downwards
there
and
must
take
the
chance
of
it
they
had
got
the
child
a
very
young
one
for
the
sake
of
the
dress
no
doubt
which
they
could
not
stop
to
pull
off
from
it
for
the
dress
shone
bright
where
the
fire
struck
it
as
if
with
gold
and
jewels
i
longed
in
my
heart
to
know
most
sadly
what
they
would
do
with
the
little
thing
and
whether
they
would
eat
it
it
touched
me
so
to
see
that
child
a
prey
among
those
vultures
that
in
my
foolish
rage
and
burning
i
stood
up
and
shouted
to
them
leaping
on
a
rock
and
raving
out
of
all
possession
two
of
them
turned
round
and
one
set
his
carbine
at
me
but
the
other
said
it
was
but
a
pixie
and
bade
him
keep
his
powder
little
they
knew
and
less
thought
i
that
the
pixie
then
before
them
would
dance
their
castle
down
one
day
john
fry
who
in
the
spring
of
fright
had
brought
himself
down
from
smilers
side
as
if
he
were
dipped
in
oil
now
came
up
to
me
all
risk
being
over
cross
and
stiff
and
aching
sorely
from
his
wet
couch
of
heather
small
thanks
to
thee
jan
as
my
new
waife
baint
a
widder
and
who
be
you
to
zupport
of
her
and
her
son
if
she
have
one
zarve
thee
right
if
i
was
to
chuck
thee
down
into
the
doonetrack
zim
theell
come
to
un
zooner
or
later
if
this
be
the
zample
of
thee
and
that
was
all
he
had
to
say
instead
of
thanking
god
for
if
ever
born
man
was
in
a
fright
and
ready
to
thank
god
for
anything
the
name
of
that
man
was
john
fry
not
more
than
five
minutes
agone
however
i
answered
nothing
at
all
except
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
and
soon
we
found
peggy
and
smiler
in
company
well
embarked
on
the
homeward
road
and
victualling
where
the
grass
was
good
right
glad
they
were
to
see
us
againnot
for
the
pleasure
of
carrying
but
because
a
horse
like
a
woman
lacks
and
is
better
without
selfreliance
my
father
never
came
to
meet
us
at
either
side
of
the
tellinghouse
neither
at
the
crooked
post
nor
even
at
homelinhay
although
the
dogs
kept
such
a
noise
that
he
must
have
heard
us
homeside
of
the
linhay
and
under
the
ashen
hedgerow
where
father
taught
me
to
catch
blackbirds
all
at
once
my
heart
went
down
and
all
my
breast
was
hollow
there
was
not
even
the
lanthorn
light
on
the
peg
against
the
cows
house
and
nobody
said
hold
your
noise
to
the
dogs
or
shouted
here
our
jack
is
i
looked
at
the
posts
of
the
gate
in
the
dark
because
they
were
tall
like
father
and
then
at
the
door
of
the
harnessroom
where
he
used
to
smoke
his
pipe
and
sing
then
i
thought
he
had
guests
perhapspeople
lost
upon
the
moorswhom
he
could
not
leave
unkindly
even
for
his
sons
sake
and
yet
about
that
i
was
jealous
and
ready
to
be
vexed
with
him
when
he
should
begin
to
make
much
of
me
and
i
felt
in
my
pocket
for
the
new
pipe
which
i
had
brought
him
from
tiverton
and
said
to
myself
he
shall
not
have
it
until
tomorrow
morning
woe
is
me
i
cannot
tell
how
i
knew
i
know
not
nowonly
that
i
slunk
away
without
a
tear
or
thought
of
weeping
and
hid
me
in
a
sawpit
there
the
timber
overhead
came
like
streaks
across
me
and
all
i
wanted
was
to
lack
and
none
to
tell
me
anything
byandby
a
noise
came
down
as
of
womans
weeping
and
there
my
mother
and
sister
were
choking
and
holding
together
although
they
were
my
dearest
loves
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
them
until
they
seemed
to
want
my
help
and
put
their
hands
before
their
eyes
chapter
iv
a
very
rash
visit
my
dear
father
had
been
killed
by
the
doones
of
bagworthy
while
riding
home
from
porlock
market
on
the
saturday
evening
with
him
were
six
brotherfarmers
all
of
them
very
sober
for
father
would
have
no
company
with
any
man
who
went
beyond
half
a
gallon
of
beer
or
a
single
gallon
of
cider
the
robbers
had
no
grudge
against
him
for
he
had
never
flouted
them
neither
made
overmuch
of
outcry
because
they
robbed
other
people
for
he
was
a
man
of
such
strict
honesty
and
due
parish
feeling
that
he
knew
it
to
be
every
mans
own
business
to
defend
himself
and
his
goods
unless
he
belonged
to
our
parish
and
then
we
must
look
after
him
these
seven
good
farmers
were
jogging
along
helping
one
another
in
the
troubles
of
the
road
and
singing
goodly
hymns
and
songs
to
keep
their
courage
moving
when
suddenly
a
horseman
stopped
in
the
starlight
full
across
them
by
dress
and
arms
they
knew
him
well
and
by
his
size
and
stature
shown
against
the
glimmer
of
the
evening
star
and
though
he
seemed
one
man
to
seven
it
was
in
truth
one
man
to
one
of
the
six
who
had
been
singing
songs
and
psalms
about
the
power
of
god
and
their
own
regenerationsuch
psalms
as
went
the
round
in
those
days
of
the
publichousesthere
was
not
one
but
pulled
out
his
money
and
sang
small
beer
to
a
doone
but
father
had
been
used
to
think
that
any
man
who
was
comfortable
inside
his
own
coat
and
waistcoat
deserved
to
have
no
other
set
unless
he
would
strike
a
blow
for
them
and
so
while
his
gossips
doffed
their
hats
and
shook
with
what
was
left
of
them
he
set
his
staff
above
his
head
and
rode
at
the
doone
robber
with
a
trick
of
his
horse
the
wild
man
escaped
the
sudden
onset
although
it
must
have
amazed
him
sadly
that
any
durst
resist
him
then
when
smiler
was
carried
away
with
the
dash
and
the
weight
of
my
father
not
being
brought
up
to
battle
nor
used
to
turn
save
in
plough
harness
the
outlaw
whistled
upon
his
thumb
and
plundered
the
rest
of
the
yeoman
but
father
drawing
at
smilers
head
to
try
to
come
back
and
help
them
was
in
the
midst
of
a
dozen
men
who
seemed
to
come
out
of
a
turfrick
some
on
horse
and
some
afoot
nevertheless
he
smote
lustily
so
far
as
he
could
see
and
being
of
great
size
and
strength
and
his
blood
well
up
they
had
no
easy
job
with
him
with
the
play
of
his
wrist
he
cracked
three
or
four
crowns
being
always
famous
at
singlestick
until
the
rest
drew
their
horses
away
and
he
thought
that
he
was
master
and
would
tell
his
wife
about
it
but
a
man
beyond
the
range
of
staff
was
crouching
by
the
peatstack
with
a
long
gun
set
to
his
shoulder
and
he
got
poor
father
against
the
sky
and
i
cannot
tell
the
rest
of
it
only
they
knew
that
smiler
came
home
with
blood
upon
his
withers
and
father
was
found
in
the
morning
dead
on
the
moor
with
his
ivytwisted
cudgel
lying
broken
under
him
now
whether
this
were
an
honest
fight
god
judge
betwixt
the
doones
and
me
it
was
more
of
woe
than
wonder
being
such
days
of
violence
that
mother
knew
herself
a
widow
and
her
children
fatherless
of
children
there
were
only
three
none
of
us
fit
to
be
useful
yet
only
to
comfort
mother
by
making
her
to
work
for
us
i
john
ridd
was
the
eldest
and
felt
it
a
heavy
thing
on
me
next
came
sister
annie
with
about
two
years
between
us
and
then
the
little
eliza
now
before
i
got
home
and
found
my
sad
lossand
no
boy
ever
loved
his
father
more
than
i
loved
minemother
had
done
a
most
wondrous
thing
which
made
all
the
neighbours
say
that
she
must
be
mad
at
least
upon
the
monday
morning
while
her
husband
lay
unburied
she
cast
a
white
hood
over
her
hair
and
gathered
a
black
cloak
round
her
and
taking
counsel
of
no
one
set
off
on
foot
for
the
doonegate
in
the
early
afternoon
she
came
to
the
hollow
and
barren
entrance
where
in
truth
there
was
no
gate
only
darkness
to
go
through
if
i
get
on
with
this
story
i
shall
have
to
tell
of
it
byandby
as
i
saw
it
afterwards
and
will
not
dwell
there
now
enough
that
no
gun
was
fired
at
her
only
her
eyes
were
covered
over
and
somebody
led
her
by
the
hand
without
any
wish
to
hurt
her
a
very
rough
and
headstrong
road
was
all
that
she
remembered
for
she
could
not
think
as
she
wished
to
do
with
the
cold
iron
pushed
against
her
at
the
end
of
this
road
they
delivered
her
eyes
and
she
could
scarce
believe
them
for
she
stood
at
the
head
of
a
deep
green
valley
carved
from
out
the
mountains
in
a
perfect
oval
with
a
fence
of
sheer
rock
standing
round
it
eighty
feet
or
a
hundred
high
from
whose
brink
black
wooded
hills
swept
up
to
the
skyline
by
her
side
a
little
river
glided
out
from
underground
with
a
soft
dark
babble
unawares
of
daylight
then
growing
brighter
lapsed
away
and
fell
into
the
valley
then
as
it
ran
down
the
meadow
alders
stood
on
either
marge
and
grass
was
blading
out
upon
it
and
yellow
tufts
of
rushes
gathered
looking
at
the
hurry
but
further
down
on
either
bank
were
covered
houses
built
of
stone
square
and
roughly
cornered
set
as
if
the
brook
were
meant
to
be
the
street
between
them
only
one
room
high
they
were
and
not
placed
opposite
each
other
but
in
and
out
as
skittles
are
only
that
the
first
of
all
which
proved
to
be
the
captains
was
a
sort
of
double
house
or
rather
two
houses
joined
together
by
a
plankbridge
over
the
river
fourteen
cots
my
mother
counted
all
very
much
of
a
pattern
and
nothing
to
choose
between
them
unless
it
were
the
captains
deep
in
the
quiet
valley
there
away
from
noise
and
violence
and
brawl
save
that
of
the
rivulet
any
man
would
have
deemed
them
homes
of
simple
mind
and
innocence
yet
not
a
single
house
stood
there
but
was
the
home
of
murder
two
men
led
my
mother
down
a
steep
and
gliddery
stairway
like
the
ladder
of
a
haymow
and
thence
from
the
break
of
the
falling
water
as
far
as
the
house
of
the
captain
and
there
at
the
door
they
left
her
trembling
strung
as
she
was
to
speak
her
mind
now
after
all
what
right
had
she
a
common
farmers
widow
to
take
it
amiss
that
men
of
birth
thought
fit
to
kill
her
husband
and
the
doones
were
of
very
high
birth
as
all
we
clods
of
exmoor
knew
and
we
had
enough
of
good
teaching
nowlet
any
man
say
the
contraryto
feel
that
all
we
had
belonged
of
right
to
those
above
us
therefore
my
mother
was
halfashamed
that
she
could
not
help
complaining
but
after
a
little
while
as
she
said
remembrance
of
her
husband
came
and
the
way
he
used
to
stand
by
her
side
and
put
his
strong
arm
round
her
and
how
he
liked
his
bacon
fried
and
praised
her
kindly
for
itand
so
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
nothing
should
gainsay
them
a
tall
old
man
sir
ensor
doone
came
out
with
a
billhook
in
his
hand
hedgers
gloves
going
up
his
arms
as
if
he
were
no
better
than
a
labourer
at
ditchwork
only
in
his
mouth
and
eyes
his
gait
and
most
of
all
his
voice
even
a
child
could
know
and
feel
that
here
was
no
ditchlabourer
good
cause
he
has
found
since
then
perhaps
to
wish
that
he
had
been
one
with
his
white
locks
moving
upon
his
coat
he
stopped
and
looked
down
at
my
mother
and
she
could
not
help
herself
but
curtsey
under
the
fixed
black
gazing
good
woman
you
are
none
of
us
who
has
brought
you
hither
young
men
must
be
youngbut
i
have
had
too
much
of
this
work
and
he
scowled
at
my
mother
for
her
comeliness
and
yet
looked
under
his
eyelids
as
if
he
liked
her
for
it
but
as
for
her
in
her
depth
of
lovegrief
it
struck
scorn
upon
her
womanhood
and
in
the
flash
she
spoke
what
you
mean
i
know
not
traitors
cutthroats
cowards
i
am
here
to
ask
for
my
husband
she
could
not
say
any
more
because
her
heart
was
now
too
much
for
her
coming
hard
in
her
throat
and
mouth
but
she
opened
up
her
eyes
at
him
madam
said
sir
ensor
doonebeing
born
a
gentleman
although
a
very
bad
onei
crave
pardon
of
you
my
eyes
are
old
or
i
might
have
known
now
if
we
have
your
husband
prisoner
he
shall
go
free
without
ransoms
because
i
have
insulted
you
sir
said
my
mother
being
suddenly
taken
away
with
sorrow
because
of
his
gracious
manner
please
to
let
me
cry
a
bit
he
stood
away
and
seemed
to
know
that
women
want
no
help
for
that
and
by
the
way
she
cried
he
knew
that
they
had
killed
her
husband
then
having
felt
of
grief
himself
he
was
not
angry
with
her
but
left
her
to
begin
again
loth
would
i
be
said
mother
sobbing
with
her
new
red
handkerchief
and
looking
at
the
pattern
of
it
loth
indeed
sir
ensor
doone
to
accuse
any
one
unfairly
but
i
have
lost
the
very
best
husband
god
ever
gave
to
a
woman
and
i
knew
him
when
he
was
to
your
belt
and
i
not
up
to
your
knee
sir
and
never
an
unkind
word
he
spoke
nor
stopped
me
short
in
speaking
all
the
herbs
he
left
to
me
and
all
the
baconcuring
and
when
it
was
best
to
kill
a
pig
and
how
to
treat
the
maidens
not
that
i
would
ever
wishoh
john
it
seems
so
strange
to
me
and
last
week
you
were
everything
here
mother
burst
out
crying
again
not
loudly
but
turning
quietly
because
she
knew
that
no
one
now
would
ever
care
to
wipe
the
tears
and
fifty
or
a
hundred
things
of
weekly
and
daily
happening
came
across
my
mother
so
that
her
spirit
fell
like
slackening
lime
this
matter
must
be
seen
to
it
shall
be
seen
to
at
once
the
old
man
answered
moved
a
little
in
spite
of
all
his
knowledge
madam
if
any
wrong
has
been
done
trust
the
honour
of
a
doone
i
will
redress
it
to
my
utmost
come
inside
and
rest
yourself
while
i
ask
about
it
what
was
your
good
husbands
name
and
when
and
where
fell
this
mishap
deary
me
said
mother
as
he
set
a
chair
for
her
very
polite
but
she
would
not
sit
upon
it
saturday
morning
i
was
a
wife
sir
and
saturday
night
i
was
a
widow
and
my
children
fatherless
my
husbands
name
was
john
ridd
sir
as
everybody
knows
and
there
was
not
a
finer
or
better
man
in
somerset
or
devon
he
was
coming
home
from
porlock
market
and
a
new
gown
for
me
on
the
crupper
and
a
shell
to
put
my
hair
upoh
john
how
good
you
were
to
me
of
that
she
began
to
think
again
and
not
to
believe
her
sorrow
except
as
a
dream
from
the
evil
one
because
it
was
too
bad
upon
her
and
perhaps
she
would
awake
in
a
minute
and
her
husband
would
have
the
laugh
of
her
and
so
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
smiled
and
looked
for
something
madam
this
is
a
serious
thing
sir
ensor
doone
said
graciously
and
showing
grave
concern
my
boys
are
a
little
wild
i
know
and
yet
i
cannot
think
that
they
would
willingly
harm
any
one
and
yetand
yet
you
do
look
wronged
send
counsellor
to
me
he
shouted
from
the
door
of
his
house
and
down
the
valley
went
the
call
send
counsellor
to
captain
counsellor
doone
came
in
ere
yet
my
mother
was
herself
again
and
if
any
sight
could
astonish
her
when
all
her
sense
of
right
and
wrong
was
gone
astray
with
the
force
of
things
it
was
the
sight
of
the
counsellor
a
squarebuilt
man
of
enormous
strength
but
a
foot
below
the
doone
stature
which
i
shall
describe
hereafter
he
carried
a
long
grey
beard
descending
to
the
leather
of
his
belt
great
eyebrows
overhung
his
face
like
ivy
on
a
pollard
oak
and
under
them
two
large
brown
eyes
as
of
an
owl
when
muting
and
he
had
a
power
of
hiding
his
eyes
or
showing
them
bright
like
a
blazing
fire
he
stood
there
with
his
beaver
off
and
mother
tried
to
look
at
him
but
he
seemed
not
to
descry
her
counsellor
said
sir
ensor
doone
standing
back
in
his
height
from
him
here
is
a
lady
of
good
repute
oh
no
sir
only
a
woman

me
madam
by
your
good
leave
here
is
a
lady
counsellor
of
great
repute
in
this
part
of
the
country
who
charges
the
doones
with
having
unjustly
slain
her
husband
murdered
him
murdered
him
cried
my
mother
if
ever
there
was
a
murder
oh
sir
oh
sir
you
know
it
the
perfect
rights
and
truth
of
the
case
is
all
i
wish
to
know
said
the
old
man
very
loftily
and
justice
shall
be
done
madam
oh
i
pray
youpray

sirs
make
no
matter
of
business
of
it
god
from

look
on
me
put
the
case
said
the
counsellor
the
case
is
this
replied
sir
ensor
holding
one
hand
up
to
mother
this
ladys
worthy
husband
was
slain
it
seems
upon
his
return
from
the
market
at
porlock
no
longer
ago
than
last
saturday
night
madam
amend
me
if
i
am
wrong
no
longer
indeed
indeed
sir
sometimes
it
seems
a
twelvemonth
and
sometimes
it
seems
an
hour
cite
his
name
said
the
counsellor
with
his
eyes
still
rolling
inwards
master
john
ridd
as
i
understand
counsellor
we
have
heard
of
him
often
a
worthy
man
and
a
peaceful
one
who
meddled
not
with
our
duties
now
if
any
of
our
boys
have
been
rough
they
shall
answer
it
dearly
and
yet
i
can
scarce
believe
it
for
the
folk
about
these
parts
are
apt
to
misconceive
of
our
sufferings
and
to
have
no
feeling
for
us
counsellor
you
are
our
record
and
very
stern
against
us
tell
us
how
this
matter
was
oh
counsellor
my
mother
cried
sir
counsellor
you
will
be
fair
i
see
it
in
your
countenance
only
tell
me
who
it
was
and
set
me
face
to
face
with
him
and
i
will
bless
you
sir
and
god
shall
bless
you
and
my
children
the
square
man
with
the
long
grey
beard
quite
unmoved
by
anything
drew
back
to
the
door
and
spoke
and
his
voice
was
like
a
fall
of
stones
in
the
bottom
of
a
mine
few
words
will
be
enow
for
this
four
or
five
of
our
bestbehaved
and
most
peaceful
gentlemen
went
to
the
little
market
at
porlock
with
a
lump
of
money
they
bought
some
household
stores
and
comforts
at
a
very
high
price
and
pricked
upon
the
homeward
road
away
from
vulgar
revellers
when
they
drew
bridle
to
rest
their
horses
in
the
shelter
of
a
peatrick
the
night
being
dark
and
sudden
a
robber
of
great
size
and
strength
rode
into
the
midst
of
them
thinking
to
kill
or
terrify
his
arrogance
and
hardihood
at
the
first
amazed
them
but
they
would
not
give
up
without
a
blow
goods
which
were
on
trust
with
them
he
had
smitten
three
of
them
senseless
for
the
power
of
his
arm
was
terrible
whereupon
the
last
man
tried
to
ward
his
blow
with
a
pistol
carver
sir
it
was
our
brave
and
noble
carver
who
saved
the
lives
of
his
brethren
and
his
own
and
glad
enow
they
were
to
escape
notwithstanding
we
hoped
it
might
be
only
a
fleshwound
and
not
to
speed
him
in
his
sins
as
this
atrocious
tale
of
lies
turned
up
joint
by
joint
before
her
like
a
devils
coachhorse

mother
was
too
much
amazed
to
do
any
more
than
look
at
him
as
if
the
earth
must
open
but
the
only
thing
that
opened
was
the
great
brown
eyes
of
the
counsellor
which
rested
on
my
mothers
face
with
a
dew
of
sorrow
as
he
spoke
of
sins

unable
to
bear
them
turned
suddenly
on
sir
ensor
and
caught
as
she
fancied
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
sense
of
quiet
enjoyment
all
the
doones
are
gentlemen
answered
the
old
man
gravely
and
looking
as
if
he
had
never
smiled
since
he
was
a
baby
we
are
always
glad
to
explain
madam
any
mistake
which
the
rustic
people
may
fall
upon
about
us
and
we
wish
you
clearly
to
conceive
that
we
do
not
charge
your
poor
husband
with
any
set
purpose
of
robbery
neither
will
we
bring
suit
for
any
attainder

property

so

without
doubt
his
land

attainted

is
mercy
you
forbear
sir
counsellor
we
will
forbear
madam
we
will
forgive
him
like
enough
he
knew
not
right
from
wrong
at
that
time
of
night
the
waters
are
strong
at
porlock
and
even
an
honest
man
may
use
his

went
round
so
that
she
curtseyed
to
them
both
scarcely
knowing
where
she
was
but
calling
to
mind
her
manners
all
the
time
she
felt
a
warmth
as
if
the
right
was
with
her
and
yet
she
could
not
see
the
way
to
spread
it
out
before
them
with
that
she
dried
her
tears
in
haste
and
went
into
the
cold
air
for
fear
of
speaking
mischief
but
when
she
was
on
the
homeward
road
and
the
sentinels
had
charge
of
her
blinding
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
not
blind
enough
with
weeping
some
one
came
in
haste
behind
her
and
thrust
a
heavy
leathern
bag
into
the
limp
weight
of
her
hand

let
it
fall
in
a
heap
as
if
it
had
been
a
blind
worm
and
then
for
the
first
time
crouched
before
god

judge

harshly
unless
the
whole

is
set
before
them
in

of
such

many
of
us
ask
leave
to
explain
how
and
why
it
was

came
to
that
head
in

would
rather

as

all
who

observe
that
here
i
enter
many
things
which
came
to
my
knowledge
in
later
years
in
or
about
the
year
of
our
lord
1640
when
all
the
troubles
of
england
were
swelling
to
an
outburst

estates
in
the
north
country
were
suddenly
confiscated
through
some
feud
of
families
and
strong
influence
at
court
and
the
owners
were
turned
upon
the
world
and
might
think
themselves
lucky
to
save
their
necks
these
estates
were
in
coheirship
joint
tenancy
i
think
they
called
it
although
i
know
not
the
meaning
only
so
that
if
either
tenant
died
the
other
living
all
would
come
to
the
live
one
in
spite
of
any
testament
one
of
the
joint
owners
was
sir
ensor
doone
a
gentleman
of
brisk
intellect
and
the
other
owner
was
his
cousin
the
earl
of
lorne
and
dykemont
lord
lorne
was
some
years
the
elder
of
his
cousin
ensor
doone
and
was
making
suit
to
gain
severance
of
the
cumbersome
joint
tenancy
by
any
fair
apportionment
when
suddenly
this
blow
fell
on
them
by
wiles
and
womans
meddling
and
instead
of
dividing
the
land
they
were
divided
from
it
the
nobleman
was
still
welltodo
though
crippled
in
his
expenditure
but
as
for
the
cousin
he
was
left
a
beggar
with
many
to
beg
from
him
he
thought
that
the
other
had
wronged
him
and
that
all
the
trouble
of
law
befell
through
his
unjust
petition
many
friends
advised
him
to
make
interest
at
court
for
having
done
no
harm
whatever
and
being
a
good
catholic
which
lord
lorne
was
not
he
would
be
sure
to
find
hearing
there
and
probably
some
favour
but
he
like
a
very
hotbrained
man
although
he
had
long
been
married
to
the
daughter
of
his
cousin
whom
he
liked
none
the
more
for
that
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
any
attempt
at
making
a
patch
of
it
but
drove
away
with
his
wife
and
sons
and
the
relics
of
his
money
swearing
hard
at
everybody
in
this
he
may
have
been
quite
wrong
probably
perhaps
he
was
so
but
i
am
not
convinced
at
all
but
what
most
of
us
would
have
done
the
same
some
say
that
in
the
bitterness
of
that
wrong
and
outrage
he
slew
a
gentleman
of
the
court
whom
he
supposed
to
have
borne
a
hand
in
the
plundering
of
his
fortunes
others
say
that
he
bearded
king
charles
the
first
himself
in
a
manner
beyond
forgiveness
one
thing
at
any
rate
is
suresir
ensor
was
attainted
and
made
a
felon
outlaw
through
some
violent
deed
ensuing
upon
his
dispossession
he
had
searched
in
many
quarters
for
somebody
to
help
him
and
with
good
warrant
for
hoping
it
inasmuch
as
he
in
lucky
days
had
been
openhanded
and
cousinly
to
all
who
begged
advice
of
him
but
now
all
these
provided
him
with
plenty
of
good
advice
indeed
and
great
assurance
of
feeling
but
not
a
movement
of
leg
or
lip
or
pursestring
in
his
favour
all
good
people
of
either
persuasion
royalty
or
commonalty
knowing
his
kitchenrange
to
be
cold
no
longer
would
play
turnspit
and
this
it
may
be
seared
his
heart
more
than
loss
of
land
and
fame
in
great
despair
at
last
he
resolved
to
settle
in
some
outlandish
part
where
none
could
be
found
to
know
him
and
so
in
an
evil
day
for
us
he
came
to
the
west
of
england
not
that
our
part
of
the
world
is
at
all
outlandish
according
to
my
view
of
it
for
i
never
found
a
better
one
but
that
it
was
known
to
be
rugged
and
large
and
desolate
and
here
when
he
had
discovered
a
place
which
seemed
almost
to
be
made
for
him
so
withdrawn
so
selfdefended
and
uneasy
of
access
some
of
the
countryfolk
around
brought
him
little
offeringsa
side
of
bacon
a
keg
of
cider
hung
mutton
or
a
brisket
of
venison
so
that
for
a
little
while
he
was
very
honest
but
when
the
newness
of
his
coming
began
to
wear
away
and
our
good
folk
were
apt
to
think
that
even
a
gentleman
ought
to
work
or
pay
other
men
for
doing
it
and
many
farmers
were
grown
weary
of
manners
without
discourse
to
them
and
all
cried
out
to
one
another
how
unfair
it
was
that
owning
such
a
fertile
valley
young
men
would
not
spade
or
plough
by
reason
of
noble
lineagethen
the
young
doones
growing
up
took
things
they
would
not
ask
for
and
here
let
me
as
a
solid
man
owner
of
five
hundred
acres
whether
fenced
or
otherwise
and
that
is
my
own
business
churchwarden
also
of
this
parish
until
i
go
to
the
churchyard
and
proud
to
be
called
the
parsons
friendfor
a
better
man
i
never
knew
with
tobacco
and
strong
waters
nor
one
who
could
read
the
lessons
so
well
and
he
has
been
at
blundells
tooonce
for
all
let
me
declare
that
i
am
a
thoroughgoing
churchandstate
man
and
royalist
without
any
mistake
about
it
and
this
i
lay
down
because
some
people
judging
a
sausage
by
the
skin
may
take
in
evil
part
my
little
glosses
of
style
and
glibness
and
the
mottled
nature
of
my
remarks
and
cracks
now
and
then
on
the
fryingpan
i
assure
them
i
am
good
inside
and
not
a
bit
of
rue
in
me
only
queer
knots
as
of
marjoram
and
a
stupid
manner
of
bursting
there
was
not
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
counting
a
few
retainers
who
still
held
by
sir
ensor
but
soon
they
grew
and
multiplied
in
a
manner
surprising
to
think
of
whether
it
was
the
venison
which
we
call
a
strengthening
victual
or
whether
it
was
the
exmoor
mutton
or
the
keen
soft
air
of
the
moorlands
anyhow
the
doones
increased
much
faster
than
their
honesty
at
first
they
had
brought
some
ladies
with
them
of
good
repute
with
charity
and
then
as
time
went
on
they
added
to
their
stock
by
carrying
they
carried
off
many
good
farmers
daughters
who
were
sadly
displeased
at
first
but
took
to
them
kindly
after
awhile
and
made
a
new
home
in
their
babies
for
women
as
it
seems
to
me
like
strong
men
more
than
weak
ones
feeling
that
they
need
some
staunchness
something
to
hold
fast
by
and
of
all
the
men
in
our
country
although
we
are
of
a
thickset
breed
you
scarce
could
find
one
in
threescore
fit
to
be
placed
among
the
doones
without
looking
no
more
than
a
tailor
like
enough
we
could
meet
them
man
for
man
if
we
chose
all
around
the
crown
and
the
skirts
of
exmoor
and
show
them
what
a
crossbuttock
means
because
we
are
so
stuggy
but
in
regard
of
stature
comeliness
and
bearing
no
woman
would
look
twice
at
us
not
but
what
i
myself
john
ridd
and
one
or
two
i
know
ofbut
it
becomes
me
best
not
to
talk
of
that
although
my
hair
is
gray
perhaps
their
den
might
well
have
been
stormed
and
themselves
driven
out
of
the
forest
if
honest
people
had
only
agreed
to
begin
with
them
at
once
when
first
they
took
to
plundering
but
having
respect
for
their
good
birth
and
pity
for
their
misfortunes
and
perhaps
a
little
admiration
at
the
justice
of
god
that
robbed
men
now
were
robbers
the
squires
and
farmers
and
shepherds
at
first
did
nothing
more
than
grumble
gently
or
even
make
a
laugh
of
it
each
in
the
case
of
others
after
awhile
they
found
the
matter
gone
too
far
for
laughter
as
violence
and
deadly
outrage
stained
the
hand
of
robbery
until
every
woman
clutched
her
child
and
every
man
turned
pale
at
the
very
name
of
doone
for
the
sons
and
grandsons
of
sir
ensor
grew
up
in
foul
liberty
and
haughtiness
and
hatred
to
utter
scorn
of
god
and
man
and
brutality
towards
dumb
animals
there
was
only
one
good
thing
about
them
if
indeed
it
were
good
to
wit
their
faith
to
one
another
and
truth
to
their
wild
eyry
but
this
only
made
them
feared
the
more
so
certain
was
the
revenge
they
wreaked
upon
any
who
dared
to
strike
a
doone
one
night
some
ten
years
ere
i
was
born
when
they
were
sacking
a
rich
mans
house
not
very
far
from
minehead
a
shot
was
fired
at
them
in
the
dark
of
which
they
took
little
notice
and
only
one
of
them
knew
that
any
harm
was
done
but
when
they
were
well
on
the
homeward
road
not
having
slain
either
man
or
woman
or
even
burned
a
house
down
one
of
their
number
fell
from
his
saddle
and
died
without
so
much
as
a
groan
the
youth
had
been
struck
but
would
not
complain
and
perhaps
took
little
heed
of
the
wound
while
he
was
bleeding
inwardly
his
brothers
and
cousins
laid
him
softly
on
a
bank
of
whortleberries
and
just
rode
back
to
the
lonely
hamlet
where
he
had
taken
his
deathwound
no
man
nor
woman
was
left
in
the
morning
nor
house
for
any
to
dwell
in
only
a
child
with
its
reason
gone
this
vile
deed
was
done
beyond
all
doubt
this
affair
made
prudent
people
find
more
reason
to
let
them
alone
than
to
meddle
with
them
and
now
they
had
so
entrenched
themselves
and
waxed
so
strong
in
number
that
nothing
less
than
a
troop
of
soldiers
could
wisely
enter
their
premises
and
even
so
it
might
turn
out
ill
as
perchance
we
shall
see
byandby
for
not
to
mention
the
strength
of
the
place
which
i
shall
describe
in
its
proper
order
when
i
come
to
visit
it
there
was
not
one
among
them
but
was
a
mighty
man
straight
and
tall
and
wide
and
fit
to
lift
four
hundredweight
if
son
or
grandson
of
old
doone
or
one
of
the
northern
retainers
failed
at
the
age
of
twenty
while
standing
on
his
naked
feet
to
touch
with
his
forehead
the
lintel
of
sir
ensors
door
and
to
fill
the
door
frame
with
his
shoulders
from
sidepost
even
to
sidepost
he
was
led
away
to
the
narrow
pass
which
made
their
valley
so
desperate
and
thrust
from
the
crown
with
ignominy
to
get
his
own
living
honestly
now
the
measure
of
that
doorway
is
or
rather
was
i
ought
to
say
six
feet
and
one
inch
lengthwise
and
two
feet
all
but
two
inches
taken
crossways
in
the
clear
yet
i
not
only
have
heard
but
know
being
so
closely
mixed
with
them
that
no
descendant
of
old
sir
ensor
neither
relative
of
his
except
indeed
the
counsellor
who
was
kept
by
them
for
his
wisdom
and
no
more
than
two
of
their
following
ever
failed
of
that
test
and
relapsed
to
the
difficult
ways
of
honesty
not
that
i
think
anything
great
of
a
standard
the
like
of
that
for
if
they
had
set
me
in
that
doorframe
at
the
age
of
twenty
it
is
like
enough
that
i
should
have
walked
away
with
it
on
my
shoulders
though
i
was
not
come
to
my
full
strength
then
only
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
average
size
of
our
neighbourhood
and
the
doones
were
far
beyond
that
moreover
they
were
taught
to
shoot
with
a
heavy
carbine
so
delicately
and
wisely
that
even
a
boy
could
pass
a
ball
through
a
rabbits
head
at
the
distance
of
fourscore
yards
some
people
may
think
nought
of
this
being
in
practice
with
longer
shots
from
the
tongue
than
from
the
shoulder
nevertheless
to
do
as
above
is
to
my
ignorance
very
good
work
if
you
can
be
sure
to
do
it
not
one
word
do
i
believe
of
robin
hood
splitting
peeled
wands
at
sevenscore
yards
and
such
like
whoever
wrote
such
stories
knew
not
how
slippery
a
peeled
wand
is
even
if
one
could
hit
it
and
how
it
gives
to
the
onset
now
let
him
stick
one
in
the
ground
and
take
his
bow
and
arrow
at
it
ten
yards
away
or
even
five
now
after
all
this
which
i
have
written
and
all
the
rest
which
a
reader
will
see
being
quicker
of
mind
than
i
am
who
leave
more
than
half
behind
me
like
a
man
sowing
wheat
with
his
dinner
laid
in
the
ditch
too
near
his
dog
it
is
much
but
what
you
will
understand
the
doones
far
better
than
i
did
or
do
even
to
this
moment
and
therefore
none
will
doubt
when
i
tell
them
that
our
good
justiciaries
feared
to
make
an
ado
or
hold
any
public
inquiry
about
my
dear
fathers
death
they
would
all
have
had
to
ride
home
that
night
and
who
could
say
what
might
betide
them
least
said
soonest
mended
because
less
chance
of
breaking
so
we
buried
him
quietlyall
except
my
mother
indeed
for
she
could
not
keep
silencein
the
sloping
little
churchyard
of
oare
as
meek
a
place
as
need
be
with
the
lynn
brook
down
below
it
there
is
not
much
of
company
there
for
anybodys
tombstone
because
the
parish
spreads
so
far
in
woods
and
moors
without
dwellinghouse
if
we
bury
one
man
in
three
years
or
even
a
woman
or
child
we
talk
about
it
for
three
months
and
say
it
must
be
our
turn
next
and
scarcely
grow
accustomed
to
it
until
another
goes
annie
was
not
allowed
to
come
because
she
cried
so
terribly
but
she
ran
to
the
window
and
saw
it
all
mooing
there
like
a
little
calf
so
frightened
and
so
left
alone
as
for
eliza
she
came
with
me
one
on
each
side
of
mother
and
not
a
tear
was
in
her
eyes
but
sudden
starts
of
wonder
and
a
new
thing
to
be
looked
at
unwillingly
yet
curiously
poor
little
thing
she
was
very
clever
the
only
one
of
our
familythank
god
for
the
samebut
none
the

it
is

chapter
vi
necessary
practice
about
the
rest
of
all
that
winter
i
remember
very
little
being
only
a
young
boy
then
and
missing
my
father
most
out
of
doors
as
when
it
came
to
the
birdcatching
or
the
tracking
of
hares
in
the
snow
or
the
training
of
a
sheepdog
oftentimes
i
looked
at
his
gun
an
ancient
piece
found
in
the
sea
a
little
below
glenthorne
and
of
which
he
was
mighty
proud
although
it
was
only
a
matchlock
and
i
thought
of
the
times
i
had
held
the
fuse
while
he
got
his
aim
at
a
rabbit
and
once
even
at
a
red
deer
rubbing
among
the
hazels
but
nothing
came
of
my
looking
at
it
so
far
as
i
remember
save
foolish
tears
of
my
own
perhaps
till
john
fry
took
it
down
one
day
from
the
hooks
where
fathers
hand
had
laid
it
and
it
hurt
me
to
see
how
john
handled
it
as
if
he
had
no
memory
bad
job

and

john
fry
jumped
in
a
livelier
manner
than
when
he
was
doing
daywork
and
i
rested
the
mouth
on
a
cross
rackpiece
and
felt
a
warm
sort
of
surety
that
i
could
hit
the
door
over
opposite
or
at
least
the
cobwall
alongside
of
it
and
do
no
harm
in
the
orchard
but
john
would
not
give
me
link
or
fuse
and
on
the
whole
i
was
glad
of
it
though
carrying
on
as
boys
do
because
i
had
heard
my
father
say
that
the
spanish
gun
kicked
like
a
horse
and
because
the
load
in
it
came
from
his
hand
and
i
did
not
like
to
undo
it
but
i
never
found
it
kick
very
hard
and
firmly
set
to
the
shoulder
unless
it
was
badly
loaded
in
truth
the
thickness
of
the
metal
was
enough
almost
to
astonish
one
and
what
our
people
said
about
it
may
have
been
true
enough
although
most
of
them
are
such
liarsat
least
i
mean
they
make
mistakes
as
all
mankind
must
do
perchance
it
was
no
mistake
at
all
to
say
that
this
ancient
gun
had
belonged
to
a
noble
spaniard
the
captain
of
a
fine
large
ship
in
the
invincible
armada
which
we
of
england
managed
to
conquer
with
god
and
the
weather
helping
us
a
hundred
years
ago
or
morei
cant
say
to
a
month
or
so
after
a
little
while
when
john
had
fired
away
at
a
rat
the
charge
i
held
so
sacred
it
came
to
me
as
a
natural
thing
to
practise
shooting
with
that
great
gun
instead
of
john
frys
blunderbuss
which
looked
like
a
bell
with
a
stalk
to
it
perhaps
for
a
boy
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
good
windmill
to
shoot
at
as
i
have
seen
them
in
flat
countries
but
we
have
no
windmills
upon
the
great
moorland
yet
here
and
there
a
few
barndoors
where
shelter
is
and
a
way
up
the
hollows
and
up
those
hollows
you
can
shoot
with
the
help
of
the
sides
to
lead
your
aim
and
there
is
a
fair
chance
of
hitting
the
door
if
you
lay
your
cheek
to
the
barrel
and
try
not
to
be
afraid
of
it
gradually
i
won
such
skill
that
i
sent
nearly
all
the
lead
gutter
from
the
north
porch
of
our
little
church
through
our
best
barndoor
a
thing
which
has
often
repented
me
since
especially
as
churchwarden
and
made
me
pardon
many
bad
boys
but
father
was
not
buried
on
that
side
of
the
church
but
all
this
time
while
i
was
roving
over
the
hills
or
about
the
farm
and
even
listening
to
john
fry
my
mother
being
so
much
older
and
feeling
trouble
longer
went
about
inside
the
house
or
among
the
maids
and
fowls
not
caring
to
talk
to
the
best
of
them
except
when
she
broke
out
sometimes
about
the
good
master
they
had
lost
all
and
every
one
of
us
but
the
fowls
would
take
no
notice
of
it
except
to
cluck
for
barley
and
the
maidens
though
they
had
liked
him
well
were
thinking
of
their
sweethearts
as
the
spring
came
on
mother
thought
it
wrong
of
them
selfish
and
ungrateful
and
yet
sometimes
she
was
proud
that
none
had
such
call
as
herself
to
grieve
for
him
only
annie
seemed
to
go
softly
in
and
out
and
cry
with
nobody
along
of
her
chiefly
in
the
corner
where
the
bees
are
and
the
grindstone
but
somehow
she
would
never
let
anybody
behold
her
being
set
as
you
may
say
to
think
it
over
by
herself
and
season
it
with
weeping
many
times
i
caught
her
and
many
times
she
turned
upon
me
and
then
i
could
not
look
at
her
but
asked
how
long
to
dinnertime
now
in
the
depth
of
the
winter
month
such
as
we
call
december
father
being
dead
and
quiet
in
his
grave
a
fortnight
it
happened
me
to
be
out
of
powder
for
practice
against
his
enemies
i
had
never
fired
a
shot
without
thinking
this
for
fathers
murderer
and
john
fry
said
that
i
made
such
faces
it
was
a
wonder
the
gun
went
off
but
though
i
could
hardly
hold
the
gun
unless
with
my
back
against
a
bar
it
did
me
good
to
hear
it
go
off
and
hope
to
have
hitten
his
enemies
oh
mother
mother
i
said
that
day
directly
after
dinner
while
she
was
sitting
looking
at
me
and
almost
ready
to
say
as
now
she
did
seven
times
in
a
week
how
like
your
father
you
are
growing
jack
come
here
and
kiss
meoh
mother
if
you
only
knew
how
much
i
want
a
shilling
jack
you
shall
never
want
a
shilling
while
i
am
alive
to
give
thee
one
but
what
is
it
for
dear
heart
dear
heart
to
buy
something
over
at
porlock
mother
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
if
i
tell
not
it
will
be
for
your
good
and
for
the
sake
of
the
children
bless
the
boy
one
would
think
he
was
threescore
years
of
age
at
least
give
me
a
little
kiss
you
jack
and
you
shall
have
the
shilling
for
i
hated
to
kiss
or
be
kissed
in
those
days
and
so
all
honest
boys
must
do
when
god
puts
any
strength
in
them
but
now
i
wanted
the
powder
so
much
that
i
went
and
kissed
mother
very
shyly
looking
round
the
corner
first
for
betty
not
to
see
me
but
mother
gave
me
half
a
dozen
and
only
one
shilling
for
all
of
them
and
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
ask
her
for
another
although
i
would
have
taken
it
in
very
quick
time
i
ran
away
with
the
shilling
in
my
pocket
and
got
peggy
out
on
the
porlock
road
without
my
mother
knowing
it
for
mother
was
frightened
of
that
road
now
as
if
all
the
trees
were
murderers
and
would
never
let
me
go
alone
so
much
as
a
hundred
yards
on
it
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
touched
with
fear
for
many
years
about
it
and
even
now
when
i
ride
at
dark
there
a
man
by
a
peatrick
makes
me
shiver
until
i
go
and
collar
him
but
this
time
i
was
very
bold
having
john
frys
blunderbuss
and
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
wherever
any
lurking
place
was
however
i
saw
only
sheep
and
small
red
cattle
and
the
common
deer
of
the
forest
until
i
was
nigh
to
porlock
town
and
then
rode
straight
to
mr
pookes
at
the
sign
of
the
spit
and
gridiron
mr
pooke
was
asleep
as
it
happened
not
having
much
to
do
that
day
and
so
i
fastened
peggy
by
the
handle
of
a
warmingpan
at
which
she
had
no
better
manners
than
to
snort
and
blow
her
breath
and
in
i
walked
with
a
manful
style
bearing
john
frys
blunderbuss
now
timothy
pooke
was
a
peaceful
man
glad
to
live
without
any
enjoyment
of
mind
at
danger
and
i
was
tall
and
large
already
as
most
lads
of
a
riper
age
mr
pooke
as
soon
as
he
opened
his
eyes
dropped
suddenly
under
the
countingboard
and
drew
a
great
fryingpan
over
his
head
as
if
the
doones
were
come
to
rob
him
as
their
custom
was
mostly
after
the
fairtime
it
made
me
feel
rather
hot
and
queer
to
be
taken
for
a
robber
and
yet
methinks
i
was
proud
of
it
gadzooks
master
pooke
said
i
having
learned
fine
words
at
tiverton
do
you
suppose
that
i
know
not
then
the
way
to
carry
firearms
an
it
were
the
old
spanish
matchlock
in
the
lieu
of
this
good
flintengine
which
may
be
borne
ten
miles
or
more
and
never
once
go
off
scarcely
couldst
thou
seem
more
scared
i
might
point
at
thee
muzzle
onjust
so
as
i
do
noweven
for
an
hour
or
more
and
like
enough
it
would
never
shoot
thee
unless
i
pulled
the
trigger
hard
with
a
crock
upon
my
finger
so
you
see
just
so
master
pooke
only
a
trifle
harder
god
sake
john
ridd
god
sake
dear
boy
cried
pooke
knowing
me
by
this
time
dont
e
for
good
love
now
dont
e
show
it
to
me
boy
as
if
i
was
to
suck
it
put
un
down
for
good
now
and
thee
shall
have
the
very
best
of
all
is
in
the
shop
ho
i
replied
with
much
contempt
and
swinging
round
the
gun
so
that
it
fetched
his
hoop
of
candles
down
all
unkindled
as
they
were
ho
as
if
i
had
not
attained
to
the
handling
of
a
gun
yet
my
hands
are
cold
coming
over
the
moors
else
would
i
go
bail
to
point
the
mouth
at
you
for
an
hour
sir
and
no
cause
for
uneasiness
but
in
spite
of
all
assurances
he
showed
himself
desirous
only
to
see
the
last
of
my
gun
and
me
i
dare
say
villainous
saltpetre
as
the
great
playwright
calls
it
was
never
so
cheap
before
nor
since
for
my
shilling
master
pooke
afforded
me
two
great
packages
overlarge
to
go
into
my
pockets
as
well
as
a
mighty
chunk
of
lead
which
i
bound
upon
peggys
withers
and
as
if
all
this
had
not
been
enough
he
presented
me
with
a
roll
of
comfits
for
my
sister
annie
whose
gentle
face
and
pretty
manners
won
the
love
of
everybody
there
was
still
some
daylight
here
and
there
as
i
rose
the
hill
above
porlock
wondering
whether
my
mother
would
be
in
a
fright
or
would
not
know
it
the
two
great
packages
of
powder
slung
behind
my
back
knocked
so
hard
against
one
another
that
i
feared
they
must
either
spill
or
blow
up
and
hurry
me
over
peggys
ears
from
the
woollen
cloth
i
rode
upon
for
father
always
liked
a
horse
to
have
some
wool
upon
his
loins
whenever
he
went
far
from
home
and
had
to
stand
about
where
one
pleased
hot
and
wet
and
panting
and
father
always
said
that
saddles
were
meant
for
men
fullgrown
and
heavy
and
losing
their
activity
and
no
boy
or
young
man
on
our
farm
durst
ever
get
into
a
saddle
because
they
all
knew
that
the
master
would
chuck
them
out
pretty
quickly
as
for
me
i
had
tried
it
once
from
a
kind
of
curiosity
and
i
could
not
walk
for
two
or
three
days
the
leather
galled
my
knees
so
but
now
as
peggy
bore
me
bravely
snorting
every
now
and
then
into
a
cloud
of
air
for
the
night
was
growing
frosty
presently
the
moon
arose
over
the
shoulder
of
a
hill
and
the
pony
and
i
were
half
glad
to
see
her
and
half
afraid
of
the
shadows
she
threw
and
the
images
all
around
us
i
was
ready
at
any
moment
to
shoot
at
anybody
having
great
faith
in
my
blunderbuss
but
hoping
not
to
prove
it
and
as
i
passed
the
narrow
place
where
the
doones
had
killed
my
father
such
a
fear
broke
out
upon
me
that
i
leaned
upon
the
neck
of
peggy
and
shut
my
eyes
and
was
cold
all
over
however
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
until
we
came
home
to
the
old
farmyard
and
there
was
my
mother
crying
sadly
and
betty
muxworthy
scolding
come
along
now
i
whispered
to
annie
the
moment
supper
was
over
and
if
you
can
hold
your
tongue
annie
i
will
show
you
something
she
lifted
herself
on
the
bench
so
quickly
and
flushed
so
rich
with
pleasure
that
i
was
obliged
to
stare
hard
away
and
make
betty
look
beyond
us
betty
thought
i
had
something
hid
in
the
closet
beyond
the
clockcase
and
she
was
the
more
convinced
of
it
by
reason
of
my
denial
not
that
betty
muxworthy
or
any
one
else
for
that
matter
ever
found
me
in
a
falsehood
because
i
never
told
one
not
even
to
my
motheror
which
is
still
a
stronger
thing
not
even
to
my
sweetheart
when
i
grew
up
to
have
onebut
that
betty
being
wronged
in
the
matter
of
marriage
a
generation
or
two
agone
by
a
man
who
came
hedging
and
ditching
had
now
no
mercy
except
to
believe
that
men
from
cradle
to
grave
are
liars
and
women
fools
to
look
at
them
when
betty
could
find
no
crime
of
mine
she
knocked
me
out
of
the
way
in
a
minute
as
if
i
had
been
nobody
and
then
she
began
to
coax
mistress
annie
as
she
always
called
her
and
draw
the
soft
hair
down
her
hands
and
whisper
into
the
little
ears
meanwhile
dear
mother
was
falling
asleep
having
been
troubled
so
much
about
me
and
watch
my
fathers
pet
dog
was
nodding
closer
and
closer
up
into
her
lap
now
annie
will
you
come
i
said
for
i
wanted
her
to
hold
the
ladle
for
melting
of
the
lead
will
you
come
at
once
annie
or
must
i
go
for
lizzie
and
let
her
see
the
whole
of
it
indeed
then
you
wont
do
that
said
annie
lizzie
to
come
before
me
john
and
she
cant
stir
a
pot
of
brewis
and
scarce
knows
a
tongue
from
a
ham
john
and
says
it
makes
no
difference
because
both
are
good
to
eat
oh
betty
what
do
you
think
of
that
to
come
of
all
her
booklearning
thank
god
he
cant
say
that
of
me
betty
answered
shortly
for
she
never
cared
about
argument
except
on
her
own
side
thank
he
i
says
every
marning
amost
never
to
lead
me
astray
so
men
is
desaving
and
so
is
galanies
but
the
most
desaving
of
all
is
books
with
their
heads
and
tails
and
the
speckots
in
em
lik
a
peg
as
have
taken
the
maisles
some
folk
purtends
to
laugh
and
cry
over
them
god
forgive
them
for
liars
it
was
part
of
bettys
obstinacy
that
she
never
would
believe
in
reading
or
the
possibility
of
it
but
stoutly
maintained
to
the
very
last
that
people
first
learned
things
by
heart
and
then
pretended
to
make
them
out
from
patterns
done
upon
paper
for
the
sake
of
astonishing
honest
folk
just
as
do
the
conjurers
and
even
to
see
the
parson
and
clerk
was
not
enough
to
convince
her
all
she
said
was
it
made
no
odds
they
were
all
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
and
now
that
she
had
been
on
the
farm
nigh
upon
forty
years
and
had
nursed
my
father
and
made
his
clothes
and
all
that
he
had
to
eat
and
then
put
him
in
his
coffin
she
was
come
to
such
authority
that
it
was
not
worth
the
wages
of
the
best
man
on
the
place
to
say
a
word
in
answer
to
betty
even
if
he
would
face
the
risk
to
have
ten
for
one
or
twenty
annie
was
her
love
and
joy
for
annie
she
would
do
anything
even
so
far
as
to
try
to
smile
when
the
little
maid
laughed
and
danced
to
her
and
in
truth
i
know
not
how
it
was
but
every
one
was
taken
with
annie
at
the
very
first
time
of
seeing
her
she
had
such
pretty
ways
and
manners
and
such
a
look
of
kindness
and
a
sweet
soft
light
in
her
long
blue
eyes
full
of
trustful
gladness
everybody
who
looked
at
her
seemed
to
grow
the
better
for
it
because
she
knew
no
evil
and
then
the
turn
she
had
for
cooking
you
never
would
have
expected
it
and
how
it
was
her
richest
mirth
to
see
that
she
had
pleased
you
i
have
been
out
on
the
world
a
vast
deal
as
you
will
own
hereafter
and
yet
have
i
never
seen
annies
equal
for
making
a
weary
man
comfortable
chapter
vii
hard
it
is
to
climb
so
many
a
winter
night
went
by
in
a
hopeful
and
pleasant
manner
with
the
hissing
of
the
bright
round
bullets
cast
into
the
water
and
the
spluttering
of
the
great
red
apples
which
annie
was
roasting
for
me
we
always
managed
our
evenings
work
in
the
chimney
of
the
backkitchen
where
there
was
room
to
set
chairs
and
table
in
spite
of
the
fire
burning
on
the
righthand
side
was
a
mighty
oven
where
betty
threatened
to
bake
us
and
on
the
left
long
sides
of
bacon
made
of
favoured
pigs
and
growing
very
brown
and
comely
annie
knew
the
names
of
all
and
ran
up
through
the
woodsmoke
every
now
and
then
when
a
gentle
memory
moved
her
and
asked
them
how
they
were
getting
on
and
when
they
would
like
to
be
eaten
then
she
came
back
with
foolish
tears
at
thinking
of
that
necessity
and
i
being
soft
in
a
different
way
would
make
up
my
mind
against
bacon
but
lord
bless
you
it
was
no
good
whenever
it
came
to
breakfasttime
after
three
hours
upon
the
moors
i
regularly
forgot
the
pigs
but
paid
good
heed
to
the
rashers
for
ours
is
a
hungry
county
if
such
there
be
in
england
a
place
i
mean
where
men
must
eat
and
are
quick
to
discharge
the
duty
the
air
of
the
moors
is
so
shrewd
and
wholesome
stirring
a
mans
recollection
of
the
good
things
which
have
betided
him
and
whetting
his
hope
of
something
still
better
in
the
future
that
by
the
time
he
sits
down
to
a
cloth
his
heart
and
stomach
are
tuned
too
well
to
say
nay
to
one
another
almost
everybody
knows
in
our
part
of
the
world
at
least
how
pleasant
and
soft
the
fall
of
the
land
is
round
about
plovers
barrows
farm
all
above
it
is
strong
dark
mountain
spread
with
heath
and
desolate
but
near
our
house
the
valleys
cove
and
open
warmth
and
shelter
here
are
trees
and
bright
green
grass
and
orchards
full
of
contentment
and
a
man
may
scarce
espy
the
brook
although
he
hears
it
everywhere
and
indeed
a
stout
good
piece
of
it
comes
through
our
farmyard
and
swells
sometimes
to
a
rush
of
waves
when
the
clouds
are
on
the
hilltops
but
all
below
where
the
valley
bends
and
the
lynn
stream
comes
along
with
it
pretty
meadows
slope
their
breast
and
the
sun
spreads
on
the
water
and
nearly
all
of
this
is
ours
till
you
come
to
nicholas
snowes
land
but
about
two
miles
below
our
farm
the
bagworthy
water
runs
into
the
lynn
and
makes
a
real
river
of
it
thence
it
hurries
away
with
strength
and
a
force
of
wilful
waters
under
the
foot
of
a
barefaced
hill
and
so
to
rocks
and
woods
again
where
the
stream
is
covered
over
and
dark
heavy
pools
delay
it
there
are
plenty
of
fish
all
down
this
way
and
the
farther
you
go
the
larger
they
get
having
deeper
grounds
to
feed
in
and
sometimes
in
the
summer
months
when
mother
could
spare
me
off
the
farm
i
came
down
here
with
annie
to
help
because
it
was
so
lonely
and
caught
wellnigh
a
basketful
of
little
trout
and
minnows
with
a
hook
and
a
bit
of
worm
on
it
or
a
fernweb
or
a
blowfly
hung
from
a
hazel
pulsestick
for
of
all
the
things
i
learned
at
blundells
only
two
abode
with
me
and
one
of
these
was
the
knack
of
fishing
and
the
other
the
art
of
swimming
and
indeed
they
have
a
very
rude
manner
of
teaching
children
to
swim
there
for
the
big
boys
take
the
little
boys
and
put
them
through
a
certain
process
which
they
grimly
call
sheepwashing
in
the
third
meadow
from
the
gate
of
the
school
going
up
the
river
there
is
a
fine
pool
in
the
lowman
where
the
taunton
brook
comes
in
and
they
call
it
the
taunton
pool
the
water
runs
down
with
a
strong
sharp
stickle
and
then
has
a
sudden
elbow
in
it
where
the
small
brook
trickles
in
and
on
that
side
the
bank
is
steep
four
or
it
may
be
five
feet
high
overhanging
loamily
but
on
the
other
side
it
is
flat
pebbly
and
fit
to
land
upon
now
the
large
boys
take
the
small
boys
crying
sadly
for
mercy
and
thinking
mayhap
of
their
mothers
with
hands
laid
well
at
the
back
of
their
necks
they
bring
them
up
to
the
crest
of
the
bank
upon
the
eastern
side
and
make
them
strip
their
clothes
off
then
the
little
boys
falling
on
their
naked
knees
blubber
upwards
piteously
but
the
large
boys
know
what
is
good
for
them
and
will
not
be
entreated
so
they
cast
them
down
one
after
other
into
the
splash
of
the
water
and
watch
them
go
to
the
bottom
first
and
then
come
up
and
fight
for
it
with
a
blowing
and
a
bubbling
it
is
a
very
fair
sight
to
watch
when
you
know
there
is
little
danger
because
although
the
pool
is
deep
the
current
is
sure
to
wash
a
boy
up
on
the
stones
where
the
end
of
the
depth
is
as
for
me
they
had
no
need
to
throw
me
more
than
once
because
i
jumped
of
my
own
accord
thinking
small
things
of
the
lowman
after
the
violent
lynn
nevertheless
i
learnt
to
swim
there
as
all
the
other
boys
did
for
the
greatest
point
in
learning
that
is
to
find
that
you
must
do
it
i
loved
the
water
naturally
and
could
not
long
be
out
of
it
but
even
the
boys
who
hated
it
most
came
to
swim
in
some
fashion
or
other
after
they
had
been
flung
for
a
year
or
two
into
the
taunton
pool
but
now
although
my
sister
annie
came
to
keep
me
company
and
was
not
to
be
parted
from
me
by
the
tricks
of
the
lynn
stream
because
i
put
her
on
my
back
and
carried
her
across
whenever
she
could
not
leap
it
or
tuck
up
her
things
and
take
the
stones
yet
so
it
happened
that
neither
of
us
had
been
up
the
bagworthy
water
we
knew
that
it
brought
a
good
stream
down
as
full
of
fish
as
of
pebbles
and
we
thought
that
it
must
be
very
pretty
to
make
a
way
where
no
way
was
nor
even
a
bullock
came
down
to
drink
but
whether
we
were
afraid
or
not
i
am
sure
i
cannot
tell
because
it
is
so
long
ago
but
i
think
that
had
something
to
do
with
it
for
bagworthy
water
ran
out
of
doone
valley
a
mile
or
so
from
the
mouth
of
it
but
when
i
was
turned
fourteen
years
old
and
put
into
good
smallclothes
buckled
at
the
knee
and
strong
blue
worsted
hosen
knitted
by
my
mother
it
happened
to
me
without
choice
i
may
say
to
explore
the
bagworthy
water
and
it
came
about
in
this
wise
my
mother
had
long
been
ailing
and
not
well
able
to
eat
much
and
there
is
nothing
that
frightens
us
so
much
as
for
people
to
have
no
love
of
their
victuals
now
i
chanced
to
remember
that
once
at
the
time
of
the
holidays
i
had
brought
dear
mother
from
tiverton
a
jar
of
pickled
loaches
caught
by
myself
in
the
lowman
river
and
baked
in
the
kitchen
oven
with
vinegar
a
few
leaves
of
bay
and
about
a
dozen
peppercorns
and
mother
had
said
that
in
all
her
life
she
had
never
tasted
anything
fit
to
be
compared
with
them
whether
she
said
so
good
a
thing
out
of
compliment
to
my
skill
in
catching
the
fish
and
cooking
them
or
whether
she
really
meant
it
is
more
than
i
can
tell
though
i
quite
believe
the
latter
and
so
would
most
people
who
tasted
them
at
any
rate
i
now
resolved
to
get
some
loaches
for
her
and
do
them
in
the
selfsame
manner
just
to
make
her
eat
a
bit
there
are
many
people
even
now
who
have
not
come
to
the
right
knowledge
what
a
loach
is
and
where
he
lives
and
how
to
catch
and
pickle
him
and
i
will
not
tell
them
all
about
it
because
if
i
did
very
likely
there
would
be
no
loaches
left
ten
or
twenty
years
after
the
appearance
of
this
book
a
pickled
minnow
is
very
good
if
you
catch
him
in
a
stickle
with
the
scarlet
fingers
upon
him
but
i
count
him
no
more
than
the
ropes
in
beer
compared
with
a
loach
done
properly
being
resolved
to
catch
some
loaches
whatever
trouble
it
cost
me
i
set
forth
without
a
word
to
any
one
in
the
forenoon
of
st
valentines
day
16756
i
think
it
must
have
been
annie
should
not
come
with
me
because
the
water
was
too
cold
for
the
winter
had
been
long
and
snow
lay
here
and
there
in
patches
in
the
hollow
of
the
banks
like
a
ladys
gloves
forgotten
and
yet
the
spring
was
breaking
forth
as
it
always
does
in
devonshire
when
the
turn
of
the
days
is
over
and
though
there
was
little
to
see
of
it
the
air
was
full
of
feeling
it
puzzles
me
now
that
i
remember
all
those
young
impressions
so
because
i
took
no
heed
of
them
at
the
time
whatever
and
yet
they
come
upon
me
bright
when
nothing
else
is
evident
in
the
gray
fog
of
experience
i
am
like
an
old
man
gazing
at
the
outside
of
his
spectacles
and
seeing
as
he
rubs
the
dust
the
image
of
his
grandson
playing
at
bopeep
with
him
but
let
me
be
of
any
age
i
never
could
forget
that
day
and
how
bitter
cold
the
water
was
for
i
doffed
my
shoes
and
hose
and
put
them
into
a
bag
about
my
neck
and
left
my
little
coat
at
home
and
tied
my
shirtsleeves
back
to
my
shoulders
then
i
took
a
threepronged
fork
firmly
bound
to
a
rod
with
cord
and
a
piece
of
canvas
kerchief
with
a
lump
of
bread
inside
it
and
so
went
into
the
pebbly
water
trying
to
think
how
warm
it
was
for
more
than
a
mile
all
down
the
lynn
stream
scarcely
a
stone
i
left
unturned
being
thoroughly
skilled
in
the
tricks
of
the
loach
and
knowing
how
he
hides
himself
for
being
grayspotted
and
clear
to
see
through
and
something
like
a
cuttlefish
only
more
substantial
he
will
stay
quite
still
where
a
streak
of
weed
is
in
the
rapid
water
hoping
to
be
overlooked
not
caring
even
to
wag
his
tail
then
being
disturbed
he
flips
away
like
whalebone
from
the
finger
and
hies
to
a
shelf
of
stone
and
lies
with
his
sharp
head
poked
in
under
it
or
sometimes
he
bellies
him
into
the
mud
and
only
shows
his
backridge
and
that
is
the
time
to
spear
him
nicely
holding
the
fork
very
gingerly
and
allowing
for
the
bent
of
it
which
comes
to
pass
i
know
not
how
at
the
tickle
of
air
and
water
or
if
your
loach
should
not
be
abroad
when
first
you
come
to
look
for
him
but
keeping
snug
in
his
little
home
then
you
may
see
him
come
forth
amazed
at
the
quivering
of
the
shingles
and
oar
himself
and
look
at
you
and
then
dart
upstream
like
a
little
grey
streak
and
then
you
must
try
to
mark
him
in
and
follow
very
daintily
so
after
that
in
a
sandy
place
you
steal
up
behind
his
tail
to
him
so
that
he
cannot
set
eyes
on
you
for
his
head
is
upstream
always
and
there
you
see
him
abiding
still
clear
and
mild
and
affable
then
as
he
looks
so
innocent
you
make
full
sure
to
prog
him
well
in
spite
of
the
wry
of
the
water
and
the
sun
making
elbows
to
everything
and
the
trembling
of
your
fingers
but
when
you
gird
at
him
lovingly
and
have
as
good
as
gotten
him
lo
in
the
goby
of
the
river
he
is
gone
as
a
shadow
goes
and
only
a
little
cloud
of
mud
curls
away
from
the
points
of
the
fork
a
long
way
down
that
limpid
water
chill
and
bright
as
an
iceberg
went
my
little
self
that
day
on
mans
choice
erranddestruction
all
the
young
fish
seemed
to
know
that
i
was
one
who
had
taken
out
gods
certificate
and
meant
to
have
the
value
of
it
every
one
of
them
was
aware
that
we
desolate
more
than
replenish
the
earth
for
a
cow
might
come
and
look
into
the
water
and
put
her
yellow
lips
down
a
kingfisher
like
a
blue
arrow
might
shoot
through
the
dark
alleys
over
the
channel
or
sit
on
a
dipping
withybough
with
his
beak
sunk
into
his
breastfeathers
even
an
otter
might
float
downstream
likening
himself
to
a
log
of
wood
with
his
flat
head
flush
with
the
watertop
and
his
oily
eyes
peering
quietly
and
yet
no
panic
would
seize
other
life
as
it
does
when
a
sample
of
man
comes
now
let
not
any
one
suppose
that
i
thought
of
these
things
when
i
was
young
for
i
knew
not
the
way
to
do
it
and
proud
enough
in
truth
i
was
at
the
universal
fear
i
spread
in
all
those
lonely
places
where
i
myself
must
have
been
afraid
if
anything
had
come
up
to
me
it
is
all
very
pretty
to
see
the
trees
big
with
their
hopes
of
another
year
though
dumb
as
yet
on
the
subject
and
the
waters
murmuring
gaiety
and
the
banks
spread
out
with
comfort
but
a
boy
takes
none
of
this
to
heart
unless
he
be
meant
for
a
poet
which
god
can
never
charge
upon
me
and
he
would
liefer
have
a
good
apple
or
even
a
bad
one
if
he
stole
it
when
i
had
travelled
two
miles
or
so
conquered
now
and
then
with
cold
and
coming
out
to
rub
my
legs
into
a
lively
friction
and
only
fishing
here
and
there
because
of
the
tumbling
water
suddenly
in
an
open
space
where
meadows
spread
about
it
i
found
a
good
stream
flowing
softly
into
the
body
of
our
brook
and
it
brought
so
far
as
i
could
guess
by
the
sweep
of
it
under
my
kneecaps
a
larger
power
of
clear
water
than
the
lynn
itself
had
only
it
came
more
quietly
down
not
being
troubled
with
stairs
and
steps
as
the
fortune
of
the
lynn
is
but
gliding
smoothly
and
forcibly
as
if
upon
some
set
purpose
hereupon
i
drew
up
and
thought
and
reason
was
much
inside
me
because
the
water
was
bitter
cold
and
my
little
toes
were
aching
so
on
the
bank
i
rubbed
them
well
with
a
sprout
of
young
stingnettle
and
having
skipped
about
awhile
was
kindly
inclined
to
eat
a
bit
now
all
the
turn
of
all
my
life
hung
upon
that
moment
but
as
i
sat
there
munching
a
crust
of
betty
muxworthys
sweet
brown
bread
and
a
bit
of
cold
bacon
along
with
it
and
kicking
my
little
red
heels
against
the
dry
loam
to
keep
them
warm
i
knew
no
more
than
fish
under
the
fork
what
was
going
on
over
me
it
seemed
a
sad
business
to
go
back
now
and
tell
annie
there
were
no
loaches
and
yet
it
was
a
frightful
thing
knowing
what
i
did
of
it
to
venture
where
no
grown
man
durst
up
the
bagworthy
water
and
please
to
recollect
that
i
was
only
a
boy
in
those
days
fond
enough
of
anything
new
but
not
like
a
man
to
meet
it
however
as
i
ate
more
and
more
my
spirit
arose
within
me
and
i
thought
of
what
my
father
had
been
and
how
he
had
told
me
a
hundred
times
never
to
be
a
coward
and
then
i
grew
warm
and
my
little
heart
was
ashamed
of
its
pitapatting
and
i
said
to
myself
now
if
father
looks
he
shall
see
that
i
obey
him
so
i
put
the
bag
round
my
back
again
and
buckled
my
breeches
far
up
from
the
knee
expecting
deeper
water
and
crossing
the
lynn
went
stoutly
up
under
the
branches
which
hang
so
dark
on
the
bagworthy
river
i
found
it
strongly
overwoven
turned
and
torn
with
thicketwood
but
not
so
rocky
as
the
lynn
and
more
inclined
to
go
evenly
there
were
bars
of
chafed
stakes
stretched
from
the
sides
halfway
across
the
current
and
light
outriders
of
pithy
weed
and
blades
of
last
years
watergrass
trembling
in
the
quiet
places
like
a
spiders
threads
on
the
transparent
stillness
with
a
tint
of
olive
moving
it
and
here
and
there
the
sun
came
in
as
if
his
light
was
sifted
making
dance
upon
the
waves
and
shadowing
the
pebbles
here
although
affrighted
often
by
the
deep
dark
places
and
feeling
that
every
step
i
took
might
never
be
taken
backward
on
the
whole
i
had
very
comely
sport
of
loaches
trout
and
minnows
forking
some
and
tickling
some
and
driving
others
to
shallow
nooks
whence
i
could
bail
them
ashore
now
if
you
have
ever
been
fishing
you
will
not
wonder
that
i
was
led
on
forgetting
all
about
danger
and
taking
no
heed
of
the
time
but
shouting
in
a
childish
way
whenever
i
caught
a
whacker
as
we
called
a
big
fish
at
tiverton
and
in
sooth
there
were
very
fine
loaches
here
having
more
lie
and
harbourage
than
in
the
rough
lynn
stream
though
not
quite
so
large
as
in
the
lowman
where
i
have
even
taken
them
to
the
weight
of
half
a
pound
but
in
answer
to
all
my
shouts
there
never
was
any
sound
at
all
except
of
a
rocky
echo
or
a
scared
bird
hustling
away
or
the
sudden
dive
of
a
watervole
and
the
place
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
the
covert
grew
darker
above
me
until
i
thought
that
the
fishes
might
have
good
chance
of
eating
me
instead
of
my
eating
the
fishes
for
now
the
day
was
falling
fast
behind
the
brown
of
the
hilltops
and
the
trees
being
void
of
leaf
and
hard
seemed
giants
ready
to
beat
me
and
every
moment
as
the
sky
was
clearing
up
for
a
white
frost
the
cold
of
the
water
got
worse
and
worse
until
i
was
fit
to
cry
with
it
and
so
in
a
sorry
plight
i
came
to
an
opening
in
the
bushes
where
a
great
black
pool
lay
in
front
of
me
whitened
with
snow
as
i
thought
at
the
sides
till
i
saw
it
was
only
foamfroth
now
though
i
could
swim
with
great
ease
and
comfort
and
feared
no
depth
of
water
when
i
could
fairly
come
to
it
yet
i
had
no
desire
to
go
over
head
and
ears
into
this
great
pool
being
so
cramped
and
weary
and
cold
enough
in
all
conscience
though
wet
only
up
to
the
middle
not
counting
my
arms
and
shoulders
and
the
look
of
this
black
pit
was
enough
to
stop
one
from
diving
into
it
even
on
a
hot
summers
day
with
sunshine
on
the
water
i
mean
if
the
sun
ever
shone
there
as
it
was
i
shuddered
and
drew
back
not
alone
at
the
pool
itself
and
the
black
air
there
was
about
it
but
also
at
the
whirling
manner
and
wisping
of
white
threads
upon
it
in
stripy
circles
round
and
round
and
the
centre
still
as
jet
but
soon
i
saw
the
reason
of
the
stir
and
depth
of
that
great
pit
as
well
as
of
the
roaring
sound
which
long
had
made
me
wonder
for
skirting
round
one
side
with
very
little
comfort
because
the
rocks
were
high
and
steep
and
the
ledge
at
the
foot
so
narrow
i
came
to
a
sudden
sight
and
marvel
such
as
i
never
dreamed
of
for
lo
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
a
long
pale
slide
of
water
coming
smoothly
to
me
without
any
break
or
hindrance
for
a
hundred
yards
or
more
and
fenced
on
either
side
with
cliff
sheer
and
straight
and
shining
the
water
neither
ran
nor
fell
nor
leaped
with
any
spouting
but
made
one
even
slope
of
it
as
if
it
had
been
combed
or
planed
and
looking
like
a
plank
of
deal
laid
down
a
deep
black
staircase
however
there
was
no
siderail
nor
any
place
to
walk
upon
only
the
channel
a
fathom
wide
and
the
perpendicular
walls
of
crag
shutting
out
the
evening
the
look
of
this
place
had
a
sad
effect
scaring
me
very
greatly
and
making
me
feel
that
i
would
give
something
only
to
be
at
home
again
with
annie
cooking
my
supper
and
our
dog
watch
sniffing
upward
but
nothing
would
come
of
wishing
that
i
had
long
found
out
and
it
only
made
one
the
less
inclined
to
work
without
white
feather
so
i
laid
the
case
before
me
in
a
little
council
not
for
loss
of
time
but
only
that
i
wanted
rest
and
to
see
things
truly
then
says
i
to
myselfjohn
ridd
these
trees
and
pools
and
lonesome
rocks
and
setting
of
the
sunlight
are
making
a
gruesome
coward
of
thee
shall
i
go
back
to
my
mother
so
and
be
called
her
fearless
boy
nevertheless
i
am
free
to
own
that
it
was
not
any
fine
sense
of
shame
which
settled
my
decision
for
indeed
there
was
nearly
as
much
of
danger
in
going
back
as
in
going
on
and
perhaps
even
more
of
labour
the
journey
being
so
roundabout
but
that
which
saved
me
from
turning
back
was
a
strange
inquisitive
desire
very
unbecoming
in
a
boy
of
little
years
in
a
word
i
would
risk
a
great
deal
to
know
what
made
the
water
come
down
like
that
and
what
there
was
at
the
top
of
it
therefore
seeing
hard
strife
before
me
i
girt
up
my
breeches
anew
with
each
buckle
one
hole
tighter
for
the
sodden
straps
were
stretching
and
giving
and
mayhap
my
legs
were
grown
smaller
from
the
coldness
of
it
then
i
bestowed
my
fish
around
my
neck
more
tightly
and
not
stopping
to
look
much
for
fear
of
fear
crawled
along
over
the
fork
of
rocks
where
the
water
had
scooped
the
stone
out
and
shunning
thus
the
ledge
from
whence
it
rose
like
the
mane
of
a
white
horse
into
the
broad
black
pool
softly
i
let
my
feet
into
the
dip
and
rush
of
the
torrent
and
here
i
had
reckoned
without
my
host
although
as
i
thought
so
clever
and
it
was
much
but
that
i
went
down
into
the
great
black
pool
and
had
never
been
heard
of
more
and
this
must
have
been
the
end
of
me
except
for
my
trusty
loachfork
for
the
green
wave
came
down
like
great
bottles
upon
me
and
my
legs
were
gone
off
in
a
moment
and
i
had
not
time
to
cry
out
with
wonder
only
to
think
of
my
mother
and
annie
and
knock
my
head
very
sadly
which
made
it
go
round
so
that
brains
were
no
good
even
if
i
had
any
but
all
in
a
moment
before
i
knew
aught
except
that
i
must
die
out
of
the
way
with
a
roar
of
water
upon
me
my
fork
praise
god
stuck
fast
in
the
rock
and
i
was
borne
up
upon
it
i
felt
nothing
except
that
here
was
another
matter
to
begin
upon
and
it
might
be
worth
while
or
again
it
might
not
to
have
another
fight
for
it
but
presently
the
dash
of
the
water
upon
my
face
revived
me
and
my
mind
grew
used
to
the
roar
of
it
and
meseemed
i
had
been
worse
off
than
this
when
first
flung
into
the
lowman
therefore
i
gathered
my
legs
back
slowly
as
if
they
were
fish
to
be
landed
stopping
whenever
the
water
flew
too
strongly
off
my
shinbones
and
coming
along
without
sticking
out
to
let
the
wave
get
hold
of
me
and
in
this
manner
i
won
a
footing
leaning
well
forward
like
a
draughthorse
and
balancing
on
my
strength
as
it
were
with
the
ashen
stake
set
behind
me
then
i
said
to
my
self
john
ridd
the
sooner
you
get
yourself
out
by
the
way
you
came
the
better
it
will
be
for
you
but
to
my
great
dismay
and
affright
i
saw
that
no
choice
was
left
me
now
except
that
i
must
climb
somehow
up
that
hill
of
water
or
else
be
washed
down
into
the
pool
and
whirl
around
it
till
it
drowned
me
for
there
was
no
chance
of
fetching
back
by
the
way
i
had
gone
down
into
it
and
further
up
was
a
hedge
of
rock
on
either
side
of
the
waterway
rising
a
hundred
yards
in
height
and
for
all
i
could
tell
five
hundred
and
no
place
to
set
a
foot
in
having
said
the
lords
prayer
which
was
all
i
knew
and
made
a
very
bad
job
of
it
i
grasped
the
good
loachstick
under
a
knot
and
steadied
me
with
my
left
hand
and
so
with
a
sigh
of
despair
began
my
course
up
the
fearful
torrentway
to
me
it
seemed
half
a
mile
at
least
of
sliding
water
above
me
but
in
truth
it
was
little
more
than
a
furlong
as
i
came
to
know
afterwards
it
would
have
been
a
hard
ascent
even
without
the
slippery
slime
and
the
force
of
the
river
over
it
and
i
had
scanty
hope
indeed
of
ever
winning
the
summit
nevertheless
my
terror
left
me
now
i
was
face
to
face
with
it
and
had
to
meet
the
worst
and
i
set
myself
to
do
my
best
with
a
vigour
and
sort
of
hardness
which
did
not
then
surprise
me
but
have
done
so
ever
since
the
water
was
only
six
inches
deep
or
from
that
to
nine
at
the
utmost
and
all
the
way
up
i
could
see
my
feet
looking
white
in
the
gloom
of
the
hollow
and
here
and
there
i
found
restingplace
to
hold
on
by
the
cliff
and
pant
awhile
and
gradually
as
i
went
on
a
warmth
of
courage
breathed
in
me
to
think
that
perhaps
no
other
had
dared
to
try
that
pass
before
me
and
to
wonder
what
mother
would
say
to
it
and
then
came
thought
of
my
father
also
and
the
pain
of
my
feet
abated
how
i
went
carefully
step
by
step
keeping
my
arms
in
front
of
me
and
never
daring
to
straighten
my
knees
is
more
than
i
can
tell
clearly
or
even
like
now
to
think
of
because
it
makes
me
dream
of
it
only
i
must
acknowledge
that
the
greatest
danger
of
all
was
just
where
i
saw
no
jeopardy
but
ran
up
a
patch
of
black
oozeweed
in
a
very
boastful
manner
being
now
not
far
from
the
summit
here
i
fell
very
piteously
and
was
like
to
have
broken
my
kneecap
and
the
torrent
got
hold
of
my
other
leg
while
i
was
indulging
the
bruised
one
and
then
a
vile
knotting
of
cramp
disabled
me
and
for
awhile
i
could
only
roar
till
my
mouth
was
full
of
water
and
all
of
my
body
was
sliding
but
the
fright
of
that
brought
me
to
again
and
my
elbow
caught
in
a
rockhole
and
so
i
managed
to
start
again
with
the
help
of
more
humility
now
being
in
the
most
dreadful
fright
because
i
was
so
near
the
top
and
hope
was
beating
within
me
i
laboured
hard
with
both
legs
and
arms
going
like
a
mill
and
grunting
at
last
the
rush
of
forked
water
where
first
it
came
over
the
lips
of
the
fall
drove
me
into
the
middle
and
i
stuck
awhile
with
my
toeballs
on
the
slippery
links
of
the
popweed
and
the
world
was
green
and
gliddery
and
i
durst
not
look
behind
me
then
i
made
up
my
mind
to
die
at
last
for
so
my
legs
would
ache
no
more
and
my
breath
not
pain
my
heart
so
only
it
did
seem
such
a
pity
after
fighting
so
long
to
give
in
and
the
light
was
coming
upon
me
and
again
i
fought
towards
it
then
suddenly
i
felt
fresh
air
and
fell
into
it
headlong
chapter
viii
a
boy
and
a
girl
when
i
came
to
myself
again
my
hands
were
full
of
young
grass
and
mould
and
a
little
girl
kneeling
at
my
side
was
rubbing
my
forehead
tenderly
with
a
dockleaf
and
a
handkerchief
oh
i
am
so
glad
she
whispered
softly
as
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
at
her
now
you
will
try
to
be
better
wont
you
i
had
never
heard
so
sweet
a
sound
as
came
from
between
her
bright
red
lips
while
there
she
knelt
and
gazed
at
me
neither
had
i
ever
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
the
large
dark
eyes
intent
upon
me
full
of
pity
and
wonder
and
then
my
nature
being
slow
and
perhaps
for
that
matter
heavy
i
wandered
with
my
hazy
eyes
down
the
black
shower
of
her
hair
as
to
my
jaded
gaze
it
seemed
and
where
it
fell
on
the
turf
among
it
like
an
early
star
was
the
first
primrose
of
the
season
and
since
that
day
i
think
of
her
through
all
the
rough
storms
of
my
life
when
i
see
an
early
primrose
perhaps
she
liked
my
countenance
and
indeed
i
know
she
did
because
she
said
so
afterwards
although
at
the
time
she
was
too
young
to
know
what
made
her
take
to
me
not
that
i
had
any
beauty
or
ever
pretended
to
have
any
only
a
solid
healthy
face
which
many
girls
have
laughed
at
thereupon
i
sate
upright
with
my
little
trident
still
in
one
hand
and
was
much
afraid
to
speak
to
her
being
conscious
of
my
countrybrogue
lest
she
should
cease
to
like
me
but
she
clapped
her
hands
and
made
a
trifling
dance
around
my
back
and
came
to
me
on
the
other
side
as
if
i
were
a
great
plaything
what
is
your
name
she
said
as
if
she
had
every
right
to
ask
me
and
how
did
you
come
here
and
what
are
these
wet
things
in
this
great
bag
you
had
better
let
them
alone
i
said
they
are
loaches
for
my
mother
but
i
will
give
you
some
if
you
like
dear
me
how
much
you
think
of
them
why
they
are
only
fish
but
how
your
feet
are
bleeding
oh
i
must
tie
them
up
for
you
and
no
shoes
nor
stockings
is
your
mother
very
poor
poor
boy
no
i
said
being
vexed
at
this
we
are
rich
enough
to
buy
all
this
great
meadow
if
we
chose
and
here
my
shoes
and
stockings
be
why
they
are
quite
as
wet
as
your
feet
and
i
cannot
bear
to
see
your
feet
oh
please
to
let
me
manage
them
i
will
do
it
very
softly
oh
i
dont
think
much
of
that
i
replied
i
shall
put
some
goosegrease
to
them
but
how
you
are
looking
at
me
i
never
saw
any
one
like
you
before
my
name
is
john
ridd
what
is
your
name
lorna
doone
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
as
if
afraid
of
it
and
hanging
her
head
so
that
i
could
see
only
her
forehead
and
eyelashes
if
you
please
my
name
is
lorna
doone
and
i
thought
you
must
have
known
it
then
i
stood
up
and
touched
her
hand
and
tried
to
make
her
look
at
me
but
she
only
turned
away
the
more
young
and
harmless
as
she
was
her
name
alone
made
guilt
of
her
nevertheless
i
could
not
help
looking
at
her
tenderly
and
the
more
when
her
blushes
turned
into
tears
and
her
tears
to
long
low
sobs
dont
cry
i
said
whatever
you
do
i
am
sure
you
have
never
done
any
harm
i
will
give
you
all
my
fish
lorna
and
catch
some
more
for
mother
only
dont
be
angry
with
me
she
flung
her
little
soft
arms
up
in
the
passion
of
her
tears
and
looked
at
me
so
piteously
that
what
did
i
do
but
kiss
her
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
odd
thing
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
because
i
hated
kissing
so
as
all
honest
boys
must
do
but
she
touched
my
heart
with
a
sudden
delight
like
a
cowslipblossom
although
there
were
none
to
be
seen
yet
and
the
sweetest
flowers
of
spring
she
gave
me
no
encouragement
as
my
mother
in
her
place
would
have
done
nay
she
even
wiped
her
lips
which
methought
was
rather
rude
of
her
and
drew
away
and
smoothed
her
dress
as
if
i
had
used
a
freedom
then
i
felt
my
cheeks
grow
burning
red
and
i
gazed
at
my
legs
and
was
sorry
for
although
she
was
not
at
all
a
proud
child
at
any
rate
in
her
countenance
yet
i
knew
that
she
was
by
birth
a
thousand
years
in
front
of
me
they
might
have
taken
and
framed
me
or
which
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
my
sisters
until
it
was
time
for
us
to
die
and
then
have
trained
our
children
after
us
for
many
generations
yet
never
could
we
have
gotten
that
look
upon
our
faces
which
lorna
doone
had
naturally
as
if
she
had
been
born
to
it
here
was
i
a
yeomans
boy
a
yeoman
every
inch
of
me
even
where
i
was
naked
and
there
was
she
a
lady
born
and
thoroughly
aware
of
it
and
dressed
by
people
of
rank
and
taste
who
took
pride
in
her
beauty
and
set
it
to
advantage
for
though
her
hair
was
fallen
down
by
reason
of
her
wildness
and
some
of
her
frock
was
touched
with
wet
where
she
had
tended
me
so
behold
her
dress
was
pretty
enough
for
the
queen
of
all
the
angels
the
colours
were
bright
and
rich
indeed
and
the
substance
very
sumptuous
yet
simple
and
free
from
tinsel
stuff
and
matching
most
harmoniously
all
from
her
waist
to
her
neck
was
white
plaited
in
close
like
a
curtain
and
the
dark
soft
weeping
of
her
hair
and
the
shadowy
light
of
her
eyes
like
a
wood
rayed
through
with
sunset
made
it
seem
yet
whiter
as
if
it
were
done
on
purpose
as
for
the
rest
she
knew
what
it
was
a
great
deal
better
than
i
did
for
i
never
could
look
far
away
from
her
eyes
when
they
were
opened
upon
me
now
seeing
how
i
heeded
her
and
feeling
that
i
had
kissed
her
although
she
was
such
a
little
girl
eight
years
old
or
thereabouts
she
turned
to
the
stream
in
a
bashful
manner
and
began
to
watch
the
water
and
rubbed
one
leg
against
the
other
i
for
my
part
being
vexed
at
her
behaviour
to
me
took
up
all
my
things
to
go
and
made
a
fuss
about
it
to
let
her
know
i
was
going
but
she
did
not
call
me
back
at
all
as
i
had
made
sure
she
would
do
moreover
i
knew
that
to
try
the
descent
was
almost
certain
death
to
me
and
it
looked
as
dark
as
pitch
and
so
at
the
mouth
i
turned
round
again
and
came
back
to
her
and
said
lorna
oh
i
thought
you
were
gone
she
answered
why
did
you
ever
come
here
do
you
know
what
they
would
do
to
us
if
they
found
you
here
with
me
beat
us
i
dare
say
very
hard
or
me
at
least
they
could
never
beat
you
no
they
would
kill
us
both
outright
and
bury
us
here
by
the
water
and
the
water
often
tells
me
that
i
must
come
to
that
but
what
should
they
kill
me
for
because
you
have
found
the
way
up
here
and
they
never
could
believe
it
now
please
to
go
oh
please
to
go
they
will
kill
us
both
in
a
moment
yes
i
like
you
very
muchfor
i
was
teasing
her
to
say
itvery
much
indeed
and
i
will
call
you
john
ridd
if
you
like
only
please
to
go
john
and
when
your
feet
are
well
you
know
you
can
come
and
tell
me
how
they
are
but
i
tell
you
lorna
i
like
you
very
much
indeednearly
as
much
as
annie
and
a
great
deal
more
than
lizzie
and
i
never
saw
any
one
like
you
and
i
must
come
back
again
tomorrow
and
so
must
you
to
see
me
and
i
will
bring
you
such
lots
of
thingsthere
are
apples
still
and
a
thrush
i
caught
with
only
one
leg
broken
and
our
dog
has
just
had
puppies
oh
dear
they
wont
let
me
have
a
dog
there
is
not
a
dog
in
the
valley
they
say
they
are
such
noisy
things
only
put
your
hand
in
minewhat
little
things
they
are
lorna
and
i
will
bring
you
the
loveliest
dog
i
will
show
you
just
how
long
he
is
hush
a
shout
came
down
the
valley
and
all
my
heart
was
trembling
like
water
after
sunset
and
lornas
face
was
altered
from
pleasant
play
to
terror
she
shrank
to
me
and
looked
up
at
me
with
such
a
power
of
weakness
that
i
at
once
made
up
my
mind
to
save
her
or
to
die
with
her
a
tingle
went
through
all
my
bones
and
i
only
longed
for
my
carbine
the
little
girl
took
courage
from
me
and
put
her
cheek
quite
close
to
mine
come
with
me
down
the
waterfall
i
can
carry
you
easily
and
mother
will
take
care
of
you
no
no
she
cried
as
i
took
her
up
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
they
are
only
looking
for
me
you
see
that
hole
that
hole
there
she
pointed
to
a
little
niche
in
the
rock
which
verged
the
meadow
about
fifty
yards
away
from
us
in
the
fading
of
the
twilight
i
could
just
descry
it
yes
i
see
it
but
they
will
see
me
crossing
the
grass
to
get
there
look
look
she
could
hardly
speak
there
is
a
way
out
from
the
top
of
it
they
would
kill
me
if
i
told
it
oh
here
they
come
i
can
see
them
the
little
maid
turned
as
white
as
the
snow
which
hung
on
the
rocks
above
her
and
she
looked
at
the
water
and
then
at
me
and
she
cried
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
then
she
began
to
sob
aloud
being
so
young
and
unready
but
i
drew
her
behind
the
withybushes
and
close
down
to
the
water
where
it
was
quiet
and
shelving
deep
ere
it
came
to
the
lip
of
the
chasm
here
they
could
not
see
either
of
us
from
the
upper
valley
and
might
have
sought
a
long
time
for
us
even
when
they
came
quite
near
if
the
trees
had
been
clad
with
their
summer
clothes
luckily
i
had
picked
up
my
fish
and
taken
my
threepronged
fork
away
crouching
in
that
hollow
nest
as
children
get
together
in
ever
so
little
compass
i
saw
a
dozen
fierce
men
come
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
not
bearing
any
firearms
but
looking
lax
and
jovial
as
if
they
were
come
from
riding
and
a
dinner
taken
hungrily
queen
queen
they
were
shouting
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
where
the
pest
is
our
little
queen
gone
they
always
call
me
queen
and
i
am
to
be
queen
byandby
lorna
whispered
to
me
with
her
soft
cheek
on
my
rough
one
and
her
little
heart
beating
against
me
oh
they
are
crossing
by
the
timber
there
and
then
they
are
sure
to
see
us
stop
said
i
now
i
see
what
to
do
i
must
get
into
the
water
and
you
must
go
to
sleep
to
be
sure
yes
away
in
the
meadow
there
but
how
bitter
cold
it
will
be
for
you
she
saw
in
a
moment
the
way
to
do
it
sooner
than
i
could
tell
her
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
now
mind
you
never
come
again
she
whispered
over
her
shoulder
as
she
crept
away
with
a
childish
twist
hiding
her
white
front
from
me
only
i
shall
come
sometimesoh
here
they
are
madonna
daring
scarce
to
peep
i
crept
into
the
water
and
lay
down
bodily
in
it
with
my
head
between
two
blocks
of
stone
and
some
flooddrift
combing
over
me
the
dusk
was
deepening
between
the
hills
and
a
white
mist
lay
on
the
river
but
i
being
in
the
channel
of
it
could
see
every
ripple
and
twig
and
rush
and
glazing
of
twilight
above
it
as
bright
as
in
a
picture
so
that
to
my
ignorance
there
seemed
no
chance
at
all
but
what
the
men
must
find
me
for
all
this
time
they
were
shouting
and
swearing
and
keeping
such
a
hullabaloo
that
the
rocks
all
round
the
valley
rang
and
my
heart
quaked
so
what
with
this
and
the
cold
that
the
water
began
to
gurgle
round
me
and
to
lap
upon
the
pebbles
neither
in
truth
did
i
try
to
stop
it
being
now
so
desperate
between
the
fear
and
the
wretchedness
till
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
little
maid
whose
beauty
and
whose
kindliness
had
made
me
yearn
to
be
with
her
and
then
i
knew
that
for
her
sake
i
was
bound
to
be
brave
and
hide
myself
she
was
lying
beneath
a
rock
thirty
or
forty
yards
from
me
feigning
to
be
fast
asleep
with
her
dress
spread
beautifully
and
her
hair
drawn
over
her
presently
one
of
the
great
rough
men
came
round
a
corner
upon
her
and
there
he
stopped
and
gazed
awhile
at
her
fairness
and
her
innocence
then
he
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
so
that
i
heard
him
and
if
i
had
only
brought
my
gun
i
would
have
tried
to
shoot
him
here
our
queen
is
heres
the
queen
heres
the
captains
daughter
he
shouted
to
his
comrades
fast
asleep
by
god
and
hearty
now
i
have
first
claim
to
her
and
no
one
else
shall
touch
the
child
back
to
the
bottle
all
of
you
he
set
her
dainty
little
form
upon
his
great
square
shoulder
and
her
narrow
feet
in
one
broad
hand
and
so
in
triumph
marched
away
with
the
purple
velvet
of
her
skirt
ruffling
in
his
long
black
beard
and
the
silken
length
of
her
hair
fetched
out
like
a
cloud
by
the
wind
behind
her
this
way
of
her
going
vexed
me
so
that
i
leaped
upright
in
the
water
and
must
have
been
spied
by
some
of
them
but
for
their
haste
to
the
winebottle
of
their
little
queen
they
took
small
notice
being
in
this
urgency
although
they
had
thought
to
find
her
drowned
but
trooped
away
after
one
another
with
kindly
challenge
to
gambling
so
far
as
i
could
make
them
out
and
i
kept
sharp
watch
i
assure
you
going
up
that
darkened
glen
little
lorna
riding
still
the
largest
and
most
fierce
of
them
turned
and
put
up
a
hand
to
me
and
i
put
up
a
hand
to
her
in
the
thick
of
the
mist
and
the
willows
she
was
gone
my
little
dear
though
tall
of
her
age
and
healthy
and
when
i
got
over
my
thriftless
fright
i
longed
to
have
more
to
say
to
her
her
voice
to
me
was
so
different
from
all
i
had
ever
heard
before
as
might
be
a
sweet
silver
bell
intoned
to
the
small
chords
of
a
harp
but
i
had
no
time
to
think
about
this
if
i
hoped
to
have
any
supper
i
crept
into
a
bush
for
warmth
and
rubbed
my
shivering
legs
on
bark
and
longed
for
mothers
fagot
then
as
daylight
sank
below
the
forgetmenot
of
stars
with
a
sorrow
to
be
quit
i
knew
that
now
must
be
my
time
to
get
away
if
there
were
any
therefore
wringing
my
sodden
breaches
i
managed
to
crawl
from
the
bank
to
the
niche
in
the
cliff
which
lorna
had
shown
me
through
the
dusk
i
had
trouble
to
see
the
mouth
at
even
the
five
landyards
of
distance
nevertheless
i
entered
well
and
held
on
by
some
dead
fernstems
and
did
hope
that
no
one
would
shoot
me
but
while
i
was
hugging
myself
like
this
with
a
boyish
manner
of
reasoning
my
joy
was
like
to
have
ended
in
sad
grief
both
to
myself
and
my
mother
and
haply
to
all
honest
folk
who
shall
love
to
read
this
history
for
hearing
a
noise
in
front
of
me
and
like
a
coward
not
knowing
where
but
afraid
to
turn
round
or
think
of
it
i
felt
myself
going
down
some
deep
passage
into
a
pit
of
darkness
it
was
no
good
to
catch
the
sides
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
go
with
me
then
without
knowing
how
i
was
leaning
over
a
night
of
water
this
water
was
of
black
radiance
as
are
certain
diamonds
spanned
across
with
vaults
of
rock
and
carrying
no
image
neither
showing
marge
nor
end
but
centred
at
it
might
be
with
a
bottomless
indrawal
with
that
chill
and
dread
upon
me
and
the
sheer
rock
all
around
and
the
faint
light
heaving
wavily
on
the
silence
of
this
gulf
i
must
have
lost
my
wits
and
gone
to
the
bottom
if
there
were
any
but
suddenly
a
robin
sang
as
they
will
do
after
dark
towards
spring
in
the
brown
fern
and
ivy
behind
me
i
took
it
for
our
little
annies
voice
for
she
could
call
any
robin
and
gathering
quick
warm
comfort
sprang
up
the
steep
way
towards
the
starlight
climbing
back
as
the
stones
glid
down
i
heard
the
cold
greedy
wave
go
japping
like
a
blind
black
dog
into
the
distance
of
arches
and
hollow
depths
of
darkness
chapter
ix
there
is
no
place
like
home
i
can
assure
you
and
tell
no
lie
as
john
fry
always
used
to
say
when
telling
his
very
largest
that
i
scrambled
back
to
the
mouth
of
that
pit
as
if
the
evil
one
had
been
after
me
and
sorely
i
repented
now
of
all
my
boyish
folly
or
madness
it
might
well
be
termed
in
venturing
with
none
to
help
and
nothing
to
compel
me
into
that
accursed
valley
once
let
me
get
out
thinks
i
and
if
ever
i
get
in
again
without
being
cast
in
by
neck
and
by
crop
i
will
give
our
newborn
donkey
leave
to
set
up
for
my
schoolmaster
how
i
kept
that
resolution
we
shall
see
hereafter
it
is
enough
for
me
now
to
tell
how
i
escaped
from
the
den
that
night
first
i
sat
down
in
the
little
opening
which
lorna
had
pointed
out
to
me
and
wondered
whether
she
had
meant
as
bitterly
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
run
down
into
the
pit
and
be
drowned
and
give
no
more
trouble
but
in
less
than
half
a
minute
i
was
ashamed
of
that
idea
and
remembered
how
she
was
vexed
to
think
that
even
a
loach
should
lose
his
life
and
then
i
said
to
myself
now
surely
she
would
value
me
more
than
a
thousand
loaches
and
what
she
said
must
be
quite
true
about
the
way
out
of
this
horrible
place
therefore
i
began
to
search
with
the
utmost
care
and
diligence
although
my
teeth
were
chattering
and
all
my
bones
beginning
to
ache
with
the
chilliness
and
the
wetness
before
very
long
the
moon
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
mountain
and
among
the
trees
at
the
top
of
it
and
then
i
espied
rough
steps
and
rocky
made
as
if
with
a
sledgehammer
narrow
steep
and
far
asunder
scooped
here
and
there
in
the
side
of
the
entrance
and
then
round
a
bulge
of
the
cliff
like
the
marks
upon
a
great
brown
loaf
where
a
hungry
child
has
picked
at
it
and
higher
up
where
the
light
of
the
moon
shone
broader
upon
the
precipice
there
seemed
to
be
a
rude
broken
track
like
the
shadow
of
a
crooked
stick
thrown
upon
a
housewall
herein
was
small
encouragement
and
at
first
i
was
minded
to
lie
down
and
die
but
it
seemed
to
come
amiss
to
me
god
has
his
time
for
all
of
us
but
he
seems
to
advertise
us
when
he
does
not
mean
to
do
it
moreover
i
saw
a
movement
of
lights
at
the
head
of
the
valley
as
if
lanthorns
were
coming
after
me
and
the
nimbleness
given
thereon
to
my
heels
was
in
front
of
all
meditation
straightway
i
set
foot
in
the
lowest
stirrup
as
i
might
almost
call
it
and
clung
to
the
rock
with
my
nails
and
worked
to
make
a
jump
into
the
second
stirrup
and
i
compassed
that
too
with
the
aid
of
my
stick
although
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
not
at
that
time
of
life
so
agile
as
boys
of
smaller
frame
are
for
my
size
was
growing
beyond
my
years
and
the
muscles
not
keeping
time
with
it
and
the
joints
of
my
bones
not
closely
hinged
with
staring
at
one
another
but
the
third
stephole
was
the
hardest
of
all
and
the
rock
swelled
out
on
me
over
my
breast
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
attempting
it
until
i
espied
a
good
stout
rope
hanging
in
a
groove
of
shadow
and
just
managed
to
reach
the
end
of
it
how
i
clomb
up
and
across
the
clearing
and
found
my
way
home
through
the
bagworthy
forest
is
more
than
i
can
remember
now
for
i
took
all
the
rest
of
it
then
as
a
dream
by
reason
of
perfect
weariness
and
indeed
it
was
quite
beyond
my
hopes
to
tell
so
much
as
i
have
told
for
at
first
beginning
to
set
it
down
it
was
all
like
a
mist
before
me
nevertheless
some
parts
grew
clearer
as
one
by
one
i
remembered
them
having
taken
a
little
soft
cordial
because
the
memory
frightens
me
for
the
toil
of
the
water
and
danger
of
labouring
up
the
long
cascade
or
rapids
and
then
the
surprise
of
the
fair
young
maid
and
terror
of
the
murderers
and
desperation
of
getting
awayall
these
are
much
to
me
even
now
when
i
am
a
stout
churchwarden
and
sit
by
the
side
of
my
fire
after
going
through
many
far
worse
adventures
which
i
will
tell
god
willing
only
the
labour
of
writing
is
such
especially
so
as
to
construe
and
challenge
a
reader
on
parts
of
speech
and
hope
to
be
even
with
him
that
by
this
pipe
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
i
ever
expect
to
be
beaten
as
in
the
days
when
old
doctor
twiggs
if
i
made
a
bad
stroke
in
my
exercise
shouted
aloud
with
a
sour
joy
john
ridd
sirrah
down
with
your
smallclothes
let
that
be
as
it
may
i
deserved
a
good
beating
that
night
after
making
such
a
fool
of
myself
and
grinding
good
fustian
to
pieces
but
when
i
got
home
all
the
supper
was
in
and
the
men
sitting
at
the
white
table
and
mother
and
annie
and
lizzie
near
by
all
eager
and
offering
to
begin
except
indeed
my
mother
who
was
looking
out
at
the
doorway
and
by
the
fire
was
betty
muxworthy
scolding
and
cooking
and
tasting
her
work
all
in
a
breath
as
a
man
would
say
i
looked
through
the
door
from
the
dark
by
the
woodstack
and
was
half
of
a
mind
to
stay
out
like
a
dog
for
fear
of
the
rating
and
reckoning
but
the
way
my
dear
mother
was
looking
about
and
the
browning
of
the
sausages
got
the
better
of
me
but
nobody
could
get
out
of
me
where
i
had
been
all
the
day
and
evening
although
they
worried
me
never
so
much
and
longed
to
shake
me
to
pieces
especially
betty
muxworthy
who
never
could
learn
to
let
well
alone
not
that
they
made
me
tell
any
lies
although
it
would
have
served
them
right
almost
for
intruding
on
other
peoples
business
but
that
i
just
held
my
tongue
and
ate
my
supper
rarely
and
let
them
try
their
taunts
and
jibes
and
drove
them
almost
wild
after
supper
by
smiling
exceeding
knowingly
and
indeed
i
could
have
told
them
things
as
i
hinted
once
or
twice
and
then
poor
betty
and
our
little
lizzie
were
so
mad
with
eagerness
that
between
them
i
went
into
the
fire
being
thoroughly
overcome
with
laughter
and
my
own
importance
now
what
the
working
of
my
mind
was
if
indeed
it
worked
at
all
and
did
not
rather
follow
suit
of
body
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
say
only
that
the
result
of
my
adventure
in
the
doone
glen
was
to
make
me
dream
a
good
deal
of
nights
which
i
had
never
done
much
before
and
to
drive
me
with
tenfold
zeal
and
purpose
to
the
practice
of
bulletshooting
not
that
i
ever
expected
to
shoot
the
doone
family
one
by
one
or
even
desired
to
do
so
for
my
nature
is
not
revengeful
but
that
it
seemed
to
be
somehow
my
business
to
understand
the
gun
as
a
thing
i
must
be
at
home
with
i
could
hit
the
barndoor
now
capitally
well
with
the
spanish
matchlock
and
even
with
john
frys
blunderbuss
at
ten
good
landyards
distance
without
any
rest
for
my
fusil
and
what
was
very
wrong
of
me
though
i
did
not
see
it
then
i
kept
john
fry
there
to
praise
my
shots
from
dinnertime
often
until
the
grey
dusk
while
he
all
the
time
should
have
been
at
work
springploughing
upon
the
farm
and
for
that
matter
so
should
i
have
been
or
at
any
rate
driving
the
horses
but
john
was
by
no
means
loath
to
be
there
instead
of
holding
the
ploughtail
and
indeed
one
of
our
old
sayings
is
for
pleasures
sake
i
would
liefer
wet
than
ha
ten
lumps
of
gold
for
each
one
of
my
sweat
and
again
which
is
not
a
bad
proverb
though
unthrifty
and
unlike
a
scotsmans
god
makes
the
wheat
grow
greener
while
farmer
be
at
his
dinner
and
no
devonshire
man
or
somerset
either
and
i
belong
to
both
of
them
ever
thinks
of
working
harder
than
god
likes
to
see
him
nevertheless
i
worked
hard
at
the
gun
and
by
the
time
that
i
had
sent
all
the
churchroof
gutters
so
far
as
i
honestly
could
cut
them
through
the
red
pinedoor
i
began
to
long
for
a
better
tool
that
would
make
less
noise
and
throw
straighter
but
the
sheepshearing
came
and
the
hayseason
next
and
then
the
harvest
of
small
corn
and
the
digging
of
the
root
called
batata
a
new
but
good
thing
in
our
neighbourhood
which
our
folk
have
made
into
taties
and
then
the
sweating
of
the
apples
and
the
turning
of
the
ciderpress
and
the
stacking
of
the
firewood
and
netting
of
the
woodcocks
and
the
springles
to
be
minded
in
the
garden
and
by
the
hedgerows
where
blackbirds
hop
to
the
molehills
in
the
white
october
mornings
and
grey
birds
come
to
look
for
snails
at
the
time
when
the
sun
is
rising
it
is
wonderful
how
time
runs
away
when
all
these
things
and
a
great
many
others
come
in
to
load
him
down
the
hill
and
prevent
him
from
stopping
to
look
about
and
i
for
my
part
can
never
conceive
how
people
who
live
in
towns
and
cities
where
neither
lambs
nor
birds
are
except
in
some
shop
windows
nor
growing
corn
nor
meadowgrass
nor
even
so
much
as
a
stick
to
cut
or
a
stile
to
climb
and
sit
down
uponhow
these
poor
folk
get
through
their
lives
without
being
utterly
weary
of
them
and
dying
from
pure
indolence
is
a
thing
god
only
knows
if
his
mercy
allows
him
to
think
of
it
how
the
year
went
by
i
know
not
only
that
i
was
abroad
all
day
shooting
or
fishing
or
minding
the
farm
or
riding
after
some
stray
beast
or
away
by
the
seaside
below
glenthorne
wondering
at
the
great
waters
and
resolving
to
go
for
a
sailor
for
in
those
days
i
had
a
firm
belief
as
many
other
strong
boys
have
of
being
born
for
a
seaman
and
indeed
i
had
been
in
a
boat
nearly
twice
but
the
second
time
mother
found
it
out
and
came
and
drew
me
back
again
and
after
that
she
cried
so
badly
that
i
was
forced
to
give
my
word
to
her
to
go
no
more
without
telling
her
but
betty
muxworthy
spoke
her
mind
quite
in
a
different
way
about
it
the
while
she
was
wringing
my
hosen
and
clattering
to
the
dryinghorse

this
discourse
of
bettys
tended
more
than
my
mothers
prayers
i
fear
to
keep
me
from
going
for
i
hated
betty
in
those
days
as
children
always
hate
a
cross
servant
and
often
get
fond
of
a
false
one
but
betty
like
many
active
women
was
false
by
her
crossness
only
thinking
it
just
for
the
moment
perhaps
and
rushing
away
with
a
bucket
ready
to
stick
to
it
like
a
clenched
nail
if
beaten
the
wrong
way
with
argument
but
melting
over
it
if
you
left
her
as
stinging
soap
left
along
in
a
basin
spreads
all
abroad
without
bubbling
but
all
this
is
beyond
the
children
and
beyond
me
too
for
that
matter
even
now
in
ripe
experience
for
i
never
did
know
what
women
mean
and
never
shall
except
when
they
tell
me
if
that
be
in
their
power
now
let
that
question
pass
for
although
i
am
now
in
a
place
of
some
authority
i
have
observed
that
no
one
ever
listens
to
me
when
i
attempt
to
lay
down
the
law
but
all
are
waiting
with
open
ears
until
i
do
enforce
it
and
so
methinks
he
who
reads
a
history
cares
not
much
for
the
wisdom
or
folly
of
the
writer
knowing
well
that
the
former
is
far
less
than
his
own
and
the
latter
vastly
greater
but
hurries
to
know
what
the
people
did
and
how
they
got
on
about
it
and
this
i
can
tell
if
any
one
can
having
been
myself
in
the
thick
of
it
the
fright
i
had
taken
that
night
in
glen
doone
satisfied
me
for
a
long
time
thereafter
and
i
took
good
care
not
to
venture
even
in
the
fields
and
woods
of
the
outer
farm
without
john
fry
for
company
john
was
greatly
surprised
and
pleased
at
the
value
i
now
set
upon
him
until
what
betwixt
the
desire
to
vaunt
and
the
longing
to
talk
things
over
i
gradually
laid
bare
to
him
nearly
all
that
had
befallen
me
except
indeed
about
lorna
whom
a
sort
of
shame
kept
me
from
mentioning
not
that
i
did
not
think
of
her
and
wish
very
often
to
see
her
again
but
of
course
i
was
only
a
boy
as
yet
and
therefore
inclined
to
despise
young
girls
as
being
unable
to
do
anything
and
only
meant
to
listen
to
orders
and
when
i
got
along
with
the
other
boys
that
was
how
we
always
spoke
of
them
if
we
deigned
to
speak
at
all
as
beings
of
a
lower
order
only
good
enough
to
run
errands
for
us
and
to
nurse
boybabies
and
yet
my
sister
annie
was
in
truth
a
great
deal
more
to
me
than
all
the
boys
of
the
parish
and
of
brendon
and
countisbury
put
together
although
at
the
time
i
never
dreamed
it
and
would
have
laughed
if
told
so
annie
was
of
a
pleasing
face
and
very
gentle
manner
almost
like
a
lady
some
people
said
but
without
any
airs
whatever
only
trying
to
give
satisfaction
and
if
she
failed
she
would
go
and
weep
without
letting
any
one
know
it
believing
the
fault
to
be
all
her
own
when
mostly
it
was
of
others
but
if
she
succeeded
in
pleasing
you
it
was
beautiful
to
see
her
smile
and
stroke
her
soft
chin
in
a
way
of
her
own
which
she
always
used
when
taking
note
how
to
do
the
right
thing
again
for
you
and
then
her
cheeks
had
a
bright
clear
pink
and
her
eyes
were
as
blue
as
the
sky
in
spring
and
she
stood
as
upright
as
a
young
appletree
and
no
one
could
help
but
smile
at
her
and
pat
her
brown
curls
approvingly
whereupon
she
always
curtseyed
for
she
never
tried
to
look
away
when
honest
people
gazed
at
her
and
even
in
the
courtyard
she
would
come
and
help
to
take
your
saddle
and
tell
without
your
asking
her
what
there
was
for
dinner
and
afterwards
she
grew
up
to
be
a
very
comely
maiden
tall
and
with
a
wellbuilt
neck
and
very
fair
white
shoulders
under
a
bright
cloud
of
curling
hair
alas
poor
annie
like
most
of
the
gentle
maidensbut
tush
i
am
not
come
to
that
yet
and
for
the
present
she
seemed
to
me
little
to
look
at
after
the
beauty
of
lorna
doone
chapter
x
a
brave
rescue
and
a
rough
ride
it
happened
upon
a
november
evening
when
i
was
about
fifteen
years
old
and
outgrowing
my
strength
very
rapidly
my
sister
annie
being
turned
thirteen
and
a
deal
of
rain
having
fallen
and
all
the
troughs
in
the
yard
being
flooded
and
the
bark
from
the
woodricks
washed
down
the
gutters
and
even
our
watershoot
going
brown
that
the
ducks
in
the
court
made
a
terrible
quacking
instead
of
marching
off
to
their
pen
one
behind
another
thereupon
annie
and
i
ran
out
to
see
what
might
be
the
sense
of
it
there
were
thirteen
ducks
and
ten
lilywhite
as
the
fashion
then
of
ducks
was
not
i
mean
twentythree
in
all
but
ten
white
and
three
brownstriped
ones
and
without
being
nice
about
their
colour
they
all
quacked
very
movingly
they
pushed
their
goldcoloured
bills
here
and
there
yet
dirty
as
gold
is
apt
to
be
and
they
jumped
on
the
triangles
of
their
feet
and
sounded
out
of
their
nostrils
and
some
of
the
overexcited
ones
ran
along
low
on
the
ground
quacking
grievously
with
their
bills
snapping
and
bending
and
the
roof
of
their
mouths
exhibited
annie
began
to
cry
dilly
dilly
einy
einy
ducksey
according
to
the
burden
of
a
tune
they
seem
to
have
accepted
as
the
national
ducks
anthem
but
instead
of
being
soothed
by
it
they
only
quacked
three
times
as
hard
and
ran
round
till
we
were
giddy
and
then
they
shook
their
tails
together
and
looked
grave
and
went
round
and
round
again
now
i
am
uncommonly
fond
of
ducks
both
roasted
and
roasting
and
roystering
and
it
is
a
fine
sight
to
behold
them
walk
poddling
one
after
other
with
their
toes
out
like
soldiers
drilling
and
their
little
eyes
cocked
all
ways
at
once
and
the
way
that
they
dib
with
their
bills
and
dabble
and
throw
up
their
heads
and
enjoy
something
and
then
tell
the
others
about
it
therefore
i
knew
at
once
by
the
way
they
were
carrying
on
that
there
must
be
something
or
other
gone
wholly
amiss
in
the
duckworld
sister
annie
perceived
it
too
but
with
a
greater
quickness
for
she
counted
them
like
a
good
duckwife
and
could
only
tell
thirteen
of
them
when
she
knew
there
ought
to
be
fourteen
and
so
we
began
to
search
about
and
the
ducks
ran
to
lead
us
aright
having
come
that
far
to
fetch
us
and
when
we
got
down
to
the
foot
of
the
courtyard
where
the
two
great
ashtrees
stand
by
the
side
of
the
little
water
we
found
good
reason
for
the
urgence
and
melancholy
of
the
duckbirds
lo
the
old
white
drake
the
father
of
all
a
bird
of
high
manners
and
chivalry
always
the
last
to
help
himself
from
the
pan
of
barleymeal
and
the
first
to
show
fight
to
a
dog
or
cock
intruding
upon
his
family
this
fine
fellow
and
pillar
of
the
state
was
now
in
a
sad
predicament
yet
quacking
very
stoutly
for
the
brook
wherewith
he
had
been
familiar
from
his
callow
childhood
and
wherein
he
was
wont
to
quest
for
waternewts
and
tadpoles
and
caddisworms
and
other
game
this
brook
which
afforded
him
very
often
scanty
space
to
dabble
in
and
sometimes
starved
the
cresses
was
now
coming
down
in
a
great
brown
flood
as
if
the
banks
never
belonged
to
it
the
foaming
of
it
and
the
noise
and
the
cresting
of
the
corners
and
the
up
and
down
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
were
enough
to
frighten
any
duck
though
bred
upon
stormy
waters
which
our
ducks
never
had
been
there
is
always
a
hurdle
six
feet
long
and
four
and
a
half
in
depth
swung
by
a
chain
at
either
end
from
an
oak
laid
across
the
channel
and
the
use
of
this
hurdle
is
to
keep
our
kine
at
milking
time
from
straying
away
there
drinking
for
in
truth
they
are
very
dainty
and
to
fence
strange
cattle
or
farmer
snowes
horses
from
coming
along
the
bed
of
the
brook
unknown
to
steal
our
substance
but
now
this
hurdle
which
hung
in
the
summer
a
foot
above
the
trickle
would
have
been
dipped
more
than
two
feet
deep
but
for
the
power
against
it
for
the
torrent
came
down
so
vehemently
that
the
chains
at
full
stretch
were
creaking
and
the
hurdle
buffeted
almost
flat
and
thatched
so
to
say
with
the
driftstuff
was
going
seesaw
with
a
sulky
splash
on
the
dirty
red
comb
of
the
waters
but
saddest
to
see
was
between
two
bars
where
a
fog
was
of
rushes
and
floodwood
and
wildcelery
haulm
and
dead
crowsfoot
who
but
our
venerable
mallard
jammed
in
by
the
joint
of
his
shoulder
speaking
aloud
as
he
rose
and
fell
with
his
topknot
full
of
water
unable
to
comprehend
it
with
his
tail
washed
far
away
from
him
but
often
compelled
to
be
silent
being
ducked
very
harshly
against
his
will
by
the
choking
fallto
of
the
hurdle
for
a
moment
i
could
not
help
laughing
because
being
borne
up
high
and
dry
by
a
tumult
of
the
torrent
he
gave
me
a
look
from
his
one
little
eye
having
lost
one
in
fight
with
the
turkeycock
a
gaze
of
appealing
sorrow
and
then
a
loud
quack
to
second
it
but
the
quack
came
out
of
time
i
suppose
for
his
throat
got
filled
with
water
as
the
hurdle
carried
him
back
again
and
then
there
was
scarcely
the
screw
of
his
tail
to
be
seen
until
he
swung
up
again
and
left
small
doubt
by
the
way
he
sputtered
and
failed
to
quack
and
hung
down
his
poor
crest
but
what
he
must
drown
in
another
minute
and
frogs
triumph
over
his
body
annie
was
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
and
i
was
about
to
rush
into
the
water
although
i
liked
not
the
look
of
it
but
hoped
to
hold
on
by
the
hurdle
when
a
man
on
horseback
came
suddenly
round
the
corner
of
the
great
ashhedge
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
and
his
horses
feet
were
in
the
water
ho
there
he
cried
get
thee
back
boy
the
flood
will
carry
thee
down
like
a
straw
i
will
do
it
for
thee
and
no
trouble
with
that
he
leaned
forward
and
spoke
to
his
mareshe
was
just
of
the
tint
of
a
strawberry
a
young
thing
very
beautifuland
she
arched
up
her
neck
as
misliking
the
job
yet
trusting
him
would
attempt
it
she
entered
the
flood
with
her
dainty
forelegs
sloped
further
and
further
in
front
of
her
and
her
delicate
ears
pricked
forward
and
the
size
of
her
great
eyes
increasing
but
he
kept
her
straight
in
the
turbid
rush
by
the
pressure
of
his
knee
on
her
then
she
looked
back
and
wondered
at
him
as
the
force
of
the
torrent
grew
stronger
but
he
bade
her
go
on
and
on
she
went
and
it
foamed
up
over
her
shoulders
and
she
tossed
up
her
lip
and
scorned
it
for
now
her
courage
was
waking
then
as
the
rush
of
it
swept
her
away
and
she
struck
with
her
forefeet
down
the
stream
he
leaned
from
his
saddle
in
a
manner
which
i
never
could
have
thought
possible
and
caught
up
old
tom
with
his
left
hand
and
set
him
between
his
holsters
and
smiled
at
his
faint
quack
of
gratitude
in
a
moment
all
these
were
carried
downstream
and
the
rider
lay
flat
on
his
horse
and
tossed
the
hurdle
clear
from
him
and
made
for
the
bend
of
smooth
water
they
landed
some
thirty
or
forty
yards
lower
in
the
midst
of
our
kitchengarden
where
the
wintercabbage
was
but
though
annie
and
i
crept
in
through
the
hedge
and
were
full
of
our
thanks
and
admiring
him
he
would
answer
us
never
a
word
until
he
had
spoken
in
full
to
the
mare
as
if
explaining
the
whole
to
her
sweetheart
i
know
thou
couldst
have
leaped
it
he
said
as
he
patted
her
cheek
being
on
the
ground
by
this
time
and
she
was
nudging
up
to
him
with
the
water
pattering
off
her
but
i
had
good
reason
winnie
dear
for
making
thee
go
through
it
she
answered
him
kindly
with
her
soft
eyes
and
smiled
at
him
very
lovingly
and
they
understood
one
another
then
he
took
from
his
waistcoat
two
peppercorns
and
made
the
old
drake
swallow
them
and
tried
him
softly
upon
his
legs
where
the
leading
gap
in
the
hedge
was
old
tom
stood
up
quite
bravely
and
clapped
his
wings
and
shook
off
the
wet
from
his
tailfeathers
and
then
away
into
the
courtyard
and
his
family
gathered
around
him
and
they
all
made
a
noise
in
their
throats
and
stood
up
and
put
their
bills
together
to
thank
god
for
this
great
deliverance
having
taken
all
this
trouble
and
watched
the
end
of
that
adventure
the
gentleman
turned
round
to
us
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
face
as
if
he
were
lightly
amused
with
himself
and
we
came
up
and
looked
at
him
he
was
rather
short
about
john
frys
height
or
may
be
a
little
taller
but
very
strongly
built
and
springy
as
his
gait
at
every
step
showed
plainly
although
his
legs
were
bowed
with
much
riding
and
he
looked
as
if
he
lived
on
horseback
to
a
boy
like
me
he
seemed
very
old
being
over
twenty
and
wellfound
in
beard
but
he
was
not
more
than
fourandtwenty
fresh
and
ruddy
looking
with
a
short
nose
and
keen
blue
eyes
and
a
merry
waggish
jerk
about
him
as
if
the
world
were
not
in
earnest
yet
he
had
a
sharp
stern
way
like
the
crack
of
a
pistol
if
anything
misliked
him
and
we
knew
for
children
see
such
things
that
it
was
safer
to
tickle
than
buffet
him
well
young
uns
what
be
gaping
at
he
gave
pretty
annie
a
chuck
on
the
chin
and
took
me
all
in
without
winking
your
mare
said
i
standing
stoutly
up
being
a
tall
boy
now
i
never
saw
such
a
beauty
sir
will
you
let
me
have
a
ride
of
her
think
thou
couldst
ride
her
lad
she
will
have
no
burden
but
mine
thou
couldst
never
ride
her
tut
i
would
be
loath
to
kill
thee
ride
her
i
cried
with
the
bravest
scorn
for
she
looked
so
kind
and
gentle
there
never
was
horse
upon
exmoor
foaled
but
i
could
tackle
in
half
an
hour
only
i
never
ride
upon
saddle
take
them
leathers
off
of
her
he
looked
at
me
with
a
dry
little
whistle
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
breechespockets
and
so
grinned
that
i
could
not
stand
it
and
annie
laid
hold
of
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
was
almost
mad
with
her
and
he
laughed
and
approved
her
for
doing
so
and
the
worst
of
all
washe
said
nothing
get
away
annie
will
you
do
you
think
im
a
fool
good
sir
only
trust
me
with
her
and
i
will
not
override
her
for
that
i
will
go
bail
my
son
she
is
liker
to
override
thee
but
the
ground
is
soft
to
fall
upon
after
all
this
rain
now
come
out
into
the
yard
young
man
for
the
sake
of
your
mothers
cabbages
and
the
mellow
strawbed
will
be
softer
for
thee
since
pride
must
have
its
fall
i
am
thy
mothers
cousin
boy
and
am
going
up
to
house
tom
faggus
is
my
name
as
everybody
knows
and
this
is
my
young
mare
winnie
what
a
fool
i
must
have
been
not
to
know
it
at
once
tom
faggus
the
great
highwayman
and
his
young
bloodmare
the
strawberry
already
her
fame
was
noised
abroad
nearly
as
much
as
her
masters
and
my
longing
to
ride
her
grew
tenfold
but
fear
came
at
the
back
of
it
not
that
i
had
the
smallest
fear
of
what
the
mare
could
do
to
me
by
fair
play
and
horsetrickery
but
that
the
glory
of
sitting
upon
her
seemed
to
be
too
great
for
me
especially
as
there
were
rumours
abroad
that
she
was
not
a
mare
after
all
but
a
witch
however
she
looked
like
a
filly
all
over
and
wonderfully
beautiful
with
her
supple
stride
and
soft
slope
of
shoulder
and
glossy
coat
beaded
with
water
and
prominent
eyes
full
of
docile
fire
whether
this
came
from
her
eastern
blood
of
the
arabs
newly
imported
and
whether
the
creamcolour
mixed
with
our
bay
led
to
that
bright
strawberry
tint
is
certainly
more
than
i
can
decide
being
chiefly
acquaint
with
farmhorses
and
these
come
of
any
colour
and
form
you
never
can
count
what
they
will
be
and
are
lucky
to
get
four
legs
to
them
mr
faggus
gave
his
mare
a
wink
and
she
walked
demurely
after
him
a
bright
young
thing
flowing
over
with
life
yet
dropping
her
soul
to
a
higher
one
and
led
by
love
to
anything
as
the
manner
is
of
females
when
they
know
what
is
the
best
for
them
then
winnie
trod
lightly
upon
the
straw
because
it
had
soft
muck
under
it
and
her
delicate
feet
came
back
again
up
for
it
still
boy
be
ye
tom
faggus
stopped
and
the
mare
stopped
there
and
they
looked
at
me
provokingly
is
she
able
to
leap
sir
there
is
good
takeoff
on
this
side
of
the
brook
mr
faggus
laughed
very
quietly
turning
round
to
winnie
so
that
she
might
enter
into
it
and
she
for
her
part
seemed
to
know
exactly
where
the
fun
lay
good
tumbleoff
you
mean
my
boy
well
there
can
be
small
harm
to
thee
i
am
akin
to
thy
family
and
know
the
substance
of
their
skulls
let
me
get
up
said
i
waxing
wroth
for
reasons
i
cannot
tell
you
because
they
are
too
manifold
take
off
your
saddlebag
things
i
will
try
not
to
squeeze
her
ribs
in
unless
she
plays
nonsense
with
me
then
mr
faggus
was
up
on
his
mettle
at
this
proud
speech
of
mine
and
john
fry
was
running
up
all
the
while
and
bill
dadds
and
half
a
dozen
tom
faggus
gave
one
glance
around
and
then
dropped
all
regard
for
me
the
high
repute
of
his
mare
was
at
stake
and
what
was
my
life
compared
to
it
through
my
defiance
and
stupid
ways
here
was
i
in
a
duello
and
my
legs
not
come
to
their
strength
yet
and
my
arms
as
limp
as
a
herring
something
of
this
occurred
to
him
even
in
his
wrath
with
me
for
he
spoke
very
softly
to
the
filly
who
now
could
scarce
subdue
herself
but
she
drew
in
her
nostrils
and
breathed
to
his
breath
and
did
all
she
could
to
answer
him
not
too
hard
my
dear
he
said
led
him
gently
down
on
the
mixen
that
will
be
quite
enough
then
he
turned
the
saddle
off
and
i
was
up
in
a
moment
she
began
at
first
so
easily
and
pricked
her
ears
so
lovingly
and
minced
about
as
if
pleased
to
find
so
light
a
weight
upon
her
that
i
thought
she
knew
i
could
ride
a
little
and
feared
to
show
any
capers
gee
wug
polly
cried
i
for
all
the
men
were
now
looking
on
being
then
at
the
leavingoff
time
gee
wug
polly
and
show
what
thou
beest
made
of
with
that
i
plugged
my
heels
into
her
and
billy
dadds
flung
his
hat
up
nevertheless
she
outraged
not
though
her
eyes
were
frightening
annie
and
john
fry
took
a
pick
to
keep
him
safe
but
she
curbed
to
and
fro
with
her
strong
forearms
rising
like
springs
ingathered
waiting
and
quivering
grievously
and
beginning
to
sweat
about
it
then
her
master
gave
a
shrill
clear
whistle
when
her
ears
were
bent
towards
him
and
i
felt
her
form
beneath
me
gathering
up
like
whalebone
and
her
hindlegs
coming
under
her
and
i
knew
that
i
was
in
for
it
first
she
reared
upright
in
the
air
and
struck
me
full
on
the
nose
with
her
comb
till
i
bled
worse
than
robin
snell
made
me
and
then
down
with
her
forefeet
deep
in
the
straw
and
her
hindfeet
going
to
heaven
finding
me
stick
to
her
still
like
wax
for
my
mettle
was
up
as
hers
was
away
she
flew
with
me
swifter
than
ever
i
went
before
or
since
i
trow
she
drove
fullhead
at
the
cobwalloh
jack
slip
off
screamed
anniethen
she
turned
like
light
when
i
thought
to
crush
her
and
ground
my
left
knee
against
it
mux
me
i
cried
for
my
breeches
were
broken
and
short
words
went
the
furthestif
you
kill
me
you
shall
die
with
me
then
she
took
the
courtyard
gate
at
a
leap
knocking
my
words
between
my
teeth
and
then
right
over
a
quick
set
hedge
as
if
the
sky
were
a
breath
to
her
and
away
for
the
watermeadows
while
i
lay
on
her
neck
like
a
child
at
the
breast
and
wished
i
had
never
been
born
straight
away
all
in
the
front
of
the
wind
and
scattering
clouds
around
her
all
i
knew
of
the
speed
we
made
was
the
frightful
flash
of
her
shoulders
and
her
mane
like
trees
in
a
tempest
i
felt
the
earth
under
us
rushing
away
and
the
air
left
far
behind
us
and
my
breath
came
and
went
and
i
prayed
to
god
and
was
sorry
to
be
so
late
of
it
all
the
long
swift
while
without
power
of
thought
i
clung
to
her
crest
and
shoulders
and
dug
my
nails
into
her
creases
and
my
toes
into
her
flankpart
and
was
proud
of
holding
on
so
long
though
sure
of
being
beaten
then
in
her
fury
at
feeling
me
still
she
rushed
at
another
device
for
it
and
leaped
the
wide
watertrough
sideways
across
to
and
fro
till
no
breath
was
left
in
me
the
hazelboughs
took
me
too
hard
in
the
face
and
the
tall
dogbriers
got
hold
of
me
and
the
ache
of
my
back
was
like
crimping
a
fish
till
i
longed
to
give
up
thoroughly
beaten
and
lie
there
and
die
in
the
cresses
but
there
came
a
shrill
whistle
from
up
the
homehill
where
the
people
had
hurried
to
watch
us
and
the
mare
stopped
as
if
with
a
bullet
then
set
off
for
home
with
the
speed
of
a
swallow
and
going
as
smoothly
and
silently
i
never
had
dreamed
of
such
delicate
motion
fluent
and
graceful
and
ambient
soft
as
the
breeze
flitting
over
the
flowers
but
swift
as
the
summer
lightning
i
sat
up
again
but
my
strength
was
all
spent
and
no
time
left
to
recover
it
and
though
she
rose
at
our
gate
like
a
bird
i
tumbled
off
into
the
mixen
chapter
xi
tom
deserves
his
supper
well
done
lad
mr
faggus
said
good
naturedly
for
all
were
now
gathered
round
me
as
i
rose
from
the
ground
somewhat
tottering
and
miry
and
crestfallen
but
otherwise
none
the
worse
having
fallen
upon
my
head
which
is
of
uncommon
substance
nevertheless
john
fry
was
laughing
so
that
i
longed
to
clout
his
ears
for
him
not
at
all
bad
work
my
boy
we
may
teach
you
to
ride
byandby
i
see
i
thought
not
to
see
you
stick
on
so
long
i
should
have
stuck
on
much
longer
sir
if
her
sides
had
not
been
wet
she
was
so
slippery
boy
thou
art
right
she
hath
given
many
the
slip
ha
ha
vex
not
jack
that
i
laugh
at
thee
she
is
like
a
sweetheart
to
me
and
better
than
any
of
them
be
it
would
have
gone
to
my
heart
if
thou
hadst
conquered
none
but
i
can
ride
my
winnie
mare
foul
shame
to
thee
then
tom
faggus
cried
mother
coming
up
suddenly
and
speaking
so
that
all
were
amazed
having
never
seen
her
wrathful
to
put
my
boy
my
boy
across
her
as
if
his
life
were
no
more
than
thine
the
only
son
of
his
father
an
honest
man
and
a
quiet
man
not
a
roystering
drunken
robber
a
man
would
have
taken
thy
mad
horse
and
thee
and
flung
them
both
into
horseponday
and
whats
more
ill
have
it
done
now
if
a
hair
of
his
head
is
injured
oh
my
boy
my
boy
what
could
i
do
without
thee
put
up
the
other
arm
johnny
all
the
time
mother
was
scolding
so
she
was
feeling
me
and
wiping
me
while
faggus
tried
to
look
greatly
ashamed
having
sense
of
the
ways
of
women
only
look
at
his
jacket
mother
cried
annie
and
a
shillingsworth
gone
from
his
smallclothes
what
care
i
for
his
clothes
thou
goose
take
that
and
heed
thine
own
a
bit
and
mother
gave
annie
a
slap
which
sent
her
swinging
up
against
mr
faggus
and
he
caught
her
and
kissed
and
protected
her
and
she
looked
at
him
very
nicely
with
great
tears
in
her
soft
blue
eyes
oh
fie
upon
thee
fie
upon
thee
cried
mother
being
yet
more
vexed
with
him
because
she
had
beaten
annie
after
all
we
have
done
for
thee
and
saved
thy
worthless
neckand
to
try
to
kill
my
son
for
me
never
more
shall
horse
of
thine
enter
stable
here
since
these
be
thy
returns
to
me
small
thanks
to
you
john
fry
i
say
and
you
bill
dadds
and
you
jem
slocomb
and
all
the
rest
of
your
coward
lot
much
you
care
for
your
masters
son
afraid
of
that
ugly
beast
yourselves
and
you
put
a
boy
just
breeched
upon
him
wull
missus
what
could
us
do
began
john
jan
wudd
goo
now
wuddt
her
jem
and
how
was
us
jan
indeed
master
john
if
you
please
to
a
lad
of
his
years
and
stature
and
now
tom
faggus
be
off
if
you
please
and
think
yourself
lucky
to
go
so
and
if
ever
that
horse
comes
into
our
yard
ill
hamstring
him
myself
if
none
of
my
cowards
dare
do
it
everybody
looked
at
mother
to
hear
her
talk
like
that
knowing
how
quiet
she
was
day
by
day
and
how
pleasant
to
be
cheated
and
the
men
began
to
shoulder
their
shovels
both
so
as
to
be
away
from
her
and
to
go
and
tell
their
wives
of
it
winnie
too
was
looking
at
her
being
pointed
at
so
much
and
wondering
if
she
had
done
amiss
and
then
she
came
to
me
and
trembled
and
stooped
her
head
and
asked
my
pardon
if
she
had
been
too
proud
with
me
winnie
shall
stop
here
tonight
said
i
for
tom
faggus
still
said
never
a
word
all
the
while
but
began
to
buckle
his
things
on
for
he
knew
that
women
are
to
be
met
with
wool
as
the
cannonballs
were
at
the
siege
of
tiverton
castle
mother
i
tell
you
winnie
shall
stop
else
i
will
go
away
with
her
i
never
knew
what
it
was
till
now
to
ride
a
horse
worth
riding
young
man
said
tom
faggus
still
preparing
sternly
to
depart
you
know
more
about
a
horse
than
any
man
on
exmoor
your
mother
may
well
be
proud
of
you
but
she
need
have
had
no
fear
as
if
i
tom
faggus
your
fathers
cousinand
the
only
thing
i
am
proud
ofwould
ever
have
let
you
mount
my
mare
which
dukes
and
princes
have
vainly
sought
except
for
the
courage
in
your
eyes
and
the
look
of
your
father
about
you
i
knew
you
could
ride
when
i
saw
you
and
rarely
you
have
conquered
but
women
dont
understand
us
goodbye
john
i
am
proud
of
you
and
i
hoped
to
have
done
you
pleasure
and
indeed
i
came
full
of
some
courtly
tales
that
would
have
made
your
hair
stand
up
but
though
not
a
crust
have
i
tasted
since
this
time
yesterday
having
given
my
meat
to
a
widow
i
will
go
and
starve
on
the
moor
far
sooner
than
eat
the
best
supper
that
ever
was
cooked
in
a
place
that
has
forgotten
me
with
that
he
fetched
a
heavy
sigh
as
if
it
had
been
for
my
father
and
feebly
got
upon
winnies
back
and
she
came
to
say
farewell
to
me
he
lifted
his
hat
to
my
mother
with
a
glance
of
sorrow
but
never
a
word
and
to
me
he
said
open
the
gate
cousin
john
if
you
please
you
have
beaten
her
so
that
she
cannot
leap
it
poor
thing
but
before
he
was
truly
gone
out
of
our
yard
my
mother
came
softly
after
him
with
her
afternoon
apron
across
her
eyes
and
one
hand
ready
to
offer
him
nevertheless
he
made
as
if
he
had
not
seen
her
though
he
let
his
horse
go
slowly
stop
cousin
tom
my
mother
said
a
word
with
you
before
you
go
why
bless
my
heart
tom
faggus
cried
with
the
form
of
his
countenance
so
changed
that
i
verily
thought
another
man
must
have
leaped
into
his
clothesdo
i
see
my
cousin
sarah
i
thought
every
one
was
ashamed
of
me
and
afraid
to
offer
me
shelter
since
i
lost
my
best
cousin
john
ridd
come
here
he
used
to
say
tom
come
here
when
you
are
worried
and
my
wife
shall
take
good
care
of
you
yes
dear
john
i
used
to
answer
i
know
she
promised
my
mother
so
but
people
have
taken
to
think
against
me
and
so
might
cousin
sarah
ah
he
was
a
man
a
man
if
you
only
heard
how
he
answered
me
but
let
that
go
i
am
nothing
now
since
the
day
i
lost
cousin
ridd
and
with
that
he
began
to
push
on
again
but
mother
would
not
have
it
so
oh
tom
that
was
a
loss
indeed
and
i
am
nothing
either
and
you
should
try
to
allow
for
me
though
i
never
found
any
one
that
did
and
mother
began
to
cry
though
father
had
been
dead
so
long
and
i
looked
on
with
a
stupid
surprise
having
stopped
from
crying
long
ago
i
can
tell
you
one
that
will
cried
tom
jumping
off
winnie
in
a
trice
and
looking
kindly
at
mother
i
can
allow
for
you
cousin
sarah
in
everything
but
one
i
am
in
some
ways
a
bad
man
myself
but
i
know
the
value
of
a
good
one
and
if
you
gave
me
orders
by
god
and
he
shook
his
fists
towards
bagworthy
wood
just
heaving
up
black
in
the
sundown
hush
tom
hush
for
gods
sake
and
mother
meant
me
without
pointing
at
me
at
least
i
thought
she
did
for
she
ever
had
weaned
me
from
thoughts
of
revenge
and
even
from
longings
for
judgment
god
knows
best
boy
she
used
to
say
let
us
wait
his
time
without
wishing
it
and
so
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
partly
through
her
teaching
and
partly
through
my
own
mild
temper
and
my
knowledge
that
father
after
all
was
killed
because
he
had
thrashed
them
goodnight
cousin
sarah
goodnight
cousin
jack
cried
tom
taking
to
the
mare
again
many
a
mile
i
have
to
ride
and
not
a
bit
inside
of
me
no
food
or
shelter
this
side
of
exeford
and
the
night
will
be
black
as
pitch
i
trow
but
it
serves
me
right
for
indulging
the
lad
being
taken
with
his
looks
so
cousin
tom
said
mother
and
trying
to
get
so
that
annie
and
i
could
not
hear
her
it
would
be
a
sad
and
unkinlike
thing
for
you
to
despise
our
dwellinghouse
we
cannot
entertain
you
as
the
lordly
inns
on
the
road
do
and
we
have
small
change
of
victuals
but
the
men
will
go
home
being
saturday
and
so
you
will
have
the
fireside
all
to
yourself
and
the
children
there
are
some
few
collops
of
red
deers
flesh
and
a
ham
just
down
from
the
chimney
and
some
dried
salmon
from
lynmouth
weir
and
cold
roastpig
and
some
oysters
and
if
none
of
those
be
to
your
liking
we
could
roast
two
woodcocks
in
half
an
hour
and
annie
would
make
the
toast
for
them
and
the
good
folk
made
some
mistake
last
week
going
up
the
country
and
left
a
keg
of
old
holland
cordial
in
the
coving
of
the
woodrick
having
borrowed
our
smiler
without
asking
leave
i
fear
there
is
something
unrighteous
about
it
but
what
can
a
poor
widow
do
john
fry
would
have
taken
it
but
for
our
jack
our
jack
was
a
little
too
sharp
for
him
ay
that
i
was
john
fry
had
got
it
like
a
billet
under
his
apron
going
away
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
as
if
to
kindle
his
fireplace
why
john
i
said
what
a
heavy
log
let
me
have
one
end
of
it
thanke
jan
no
need
of
thiccy
he
answered
turning
his
back
to
me
waife
wanteth
a
log
as
will
last
all
day
to
kape
the
crock
a
zimmerin
and
he
banged
his
gate
upon
my
heels
to
make
me
stop
and
rub
them
why
john
said
i
youm
got
a
log
with
round
holes
in
the
end
of
it
who
has
been
cutting
gunwads
just
lift
your
apron
or
i
will
but
to
return
to
tom
faggushe
stopped
to
sup
that
night
with
us
and
took
a
little
of
everything
a
few
oysters
first
and
then
dried
salmon
and
then
ham
and
eggs
done
in
small
curled
rashers
and
then
a
few
collops
of
venison
toasted
and
next
to
that
a
little
cold
roastpig
and
a
woodcock
on
toast
to
finish
with
before
the
scheidam
and
hot
water
and
having
changed
his
wet
things
first
he
seemed
to
be
in
fair
appetite
and
praised
annies
cooking
mightily
with
a
kind
of
noise
like
a
smack
of
his
lips
and
a
rubbing
of
his
hands
together
whenever
he
could
spare
them
he
had
gotten
john
frys
best
smallclothes
on
for
he
said
he
was
not
good
enough
to
go
into
my
fathers
which
mother
kept
to
look
at
nor
man
enough
to
fill
them
and
in
truth
my
mother
was
very
glad
that
he
refused
when
i
offered
them
but
john
was
overproud
to
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
that
such
a
famous
man
had
ever
dwelt
in
any
clothes
of
his
and
afterwards
he
made
show
of
them
for
mr
fagguss
glory
then
though
not
so
great
as
now
it
is
was
spreading
very
fast
indeed
all
about
our
neighbourhood
and
even
as
far
as
bridgewater
tom
faggus
was
a
jovial
soul
if
ever
there
has
been
one
not
making
bones
of
little
things
nor
caring
to
seek
evil
there
was
about
him
such
a
love
of
genuine
human
nature
that
if
a
traveller
said
a
good
thing
he
would
give
him
back
his
purse
again
it
is
true
that
he
took
peoples
money
more
by
force
than
fraud
and
the
law
being
used
to
the
inverse
method
was
bitterly
moved
against
him
although
he
could
quote
precedent
these
things
i
do
not
understand
having
seen
so
much
of
robbery
some
legal
some
illegal
that
i
scarcely
know
as
here
we
say
one
crows
foot
from
the
other
it
is
beyond
me
and
above
me
to
discuss
these
subjects
and
in
truth
i
love
the
law
right
well
when
it
doth
support
me
and
when
i
can
lay
it
down
to
my
liking
with
prejudice
to
nobody
loyal
too
to
the
king
am
i
as
behoves
churchwarden
and
ready
to
make
the
best
of
him
as
he
generally
requires
but
after
all
i
could
not
see
until
i
grew
much
older
and
came
to
have
some
property
why
tom
faggus
working
hard
was
called
a
robber
and
felon
of
great
while
the
king
doing
nothing
at
all
as
became
his
dignity
was
liegelord
and
paramount
owner
with
everybody
to
thank
him
kindly
for
accepting
tribute
for
the
present
however
i
learned
nothing
more
as
to
what
our
cousins
profession
was
only
that
mother
seemed
frightened
and
whispered
to
him
now
and
then
not
to
talk
of
something
because
of
the
children
being
there
whereupon
he
always
nodded
with
a
sage
expression
and
applied
himself
to
hollands
now
let
us
go
and
see
winnie
jack
he
said
to
me
after
supper
for
the
most
part
i
feed
her
before
myself
but
she
was
so
hot
from
the
way
you
drove
her
now
she
must
be
grieving
for
me
and
i
never
let
her
grieve
long
i
was
too
glad
to
go
with
him
and
annie
came
slyly
after
us
the
filly
was
walking
to
and
fro
on
the
naked
floor
of
the
stable
for
he
would
not
let
her
have
any
straw
until
he
should
make
a
bed
for
her
and
without
so
much
as
a
headstall
on
for
he
would
not
have
her
fastened
do
you
take
my
mare
for
a
dog
he
had
said
when
john
fry
brought
him
a
halter
and
now
she
ran
to
him
like
a
child
and
her
great
eyes
shone
at
the
lanthorn
hit
me
jack
and
see
what
she
will
do
i
will
not
let
her
hurt
thee
he
was
rubbing
her
ears
all
the
time
he
spoke
and
she
was
leaning
against
him
then
i
made
believe
to
strike
him
and
in
a
moment
she
caught
me
by
the
waistband
and
lifted
me
clean
from
the
ground
and
was
casting
me
down
to
trample
upon
me
when
he
stopped
her
suddenly
what
think
you
of
that
boy
have
you
horse
or
dog
that
would
do
that
for
you
ay
and
more
than
that
she
will
do
if
i
were
to
whistle
byandby
in
the
tone
that
tells
my
danger
she
would
break
this
stabledoor
down
and
rush
into
the
room
to
me
nothing
will
keep
her
from
me
then
stonewall
or
churchtower
ah
winnie
winnie
you
little
witch
we
shall
die
together
then
he
turned
away
with
a
joke
and
began
to
feed
her
nicely
for
she
was
very
dainty
not
a
husk
of
oat
would
she
touch
that
had
been
under
the
breath
of
another
horse
however
hungry
she
might
be
and
with
her
oats
he
mixed
some
powder
fetching
it
from
his
saddlebags
what
this
was
i
could
not
guess
neither
would
he
tell
me
but
laughed
and
called
it
starshavings
he
watched
her
eat
every
morsel
of
it
with
two
or
three
drinks
of
pure
water
ministered
between
whiles
and
then
he
made
her
bed
in
a
form
i
had
never
seen
before
and
so
we
said
goodnight
to
her
afterwards
by
the
fireside
he
kept
us
very
merry
sitting
in
the
great
chimneycorner
and
making
us
play
games
with
him
and
all
the
while
he
was
smoking
tobacco
in
a
manner
i
never
had
seen
before
not
using
any
pipe
for
it
but
having
it
rolled
in
little
sticks
about
as
long
as
my
finger
blunt
at
one
end
and
sharp
at
the
other
the
sharp
end
he
would
put
in
his
mouth
and
lay
a
brand
of
wood
to
the
other
and
then
draw
a
white
cloud
of
curling
smoke
and
we
never
tired
of
watching
him
i
wanted
him
to
let
me
do
it
but
he
said
no
my
son
it
is
not
meant
for
boys
then
annie
put
up
her
lips
and
asked
with
both
hands
on
his
knees
for
she
had
taken
to
him
wonderfully
is
it
meant
for
girls
then
cousin
tom
but
she
had
better
not
have
asked
for
he
gave
it
her
to
try
and
she
shut
both
eyes
and
sucked
at
it
one
breath
however
was
quite
enough
for
it
made
her
cough
so
violently
that
lizzie
and
i
must
thump
her
back
until
she
was
almost
crying
to
atone
for
that
cousin
tom
set
to
and
told
us
whole
pages
of
stories
not
about
his
own
doings
at
all
but
strangely
enough
they
seemed
to
concern
almost
every
one
else
we
had
ever
heard
of
without
halting
once
for
a
word
or
a
deed
his
tales
flowed
onward
as
freely
and
brightly
as
the
flames
of
the
wood
up
the
chimney
and
with
no
smaller
variety
for
he
spoke
with
the
voices
of
twenty
people
giving
each
person
the
proper
manner
and
the
proper
place
to
speak
from
so
that
annie
and
lizzie
ran
all
about
and
searched
the
clock
and
the
linenpress
and
he
changed
his
face
every
moment
so
and
with
such
power
of
mimicry
that
without
so
much
as
a
smile
of
his
own
he
made
even
mother
laugh
so
that
she
broke
her
new
tenpenny
waistband
and
as
for
us
children
we
rolled
on
the
floor
and
betty
muxworthy
roared
in
the
washup
chapter
xii
a
man
justly
popular
now
although
mr
faggus
was
so
clever
and
generous
and
celebrated
i
know
not
whether
upon
the
whole
we
were
rather
proud
of
him
as
a
member
of
our
family
or
inclined
to
be
ashamed
of
him
and
indeed
i
think
that
the
sway
of
the
balance
hung
upon
the
company
we
were
in
for
instance
with
the
boys
at
brendonfor
there
is
no
village
at
oarei
was
exceeding
proud
to
talk
of
him
and
would
freely
brag
of
my
cousin
tom
but
with
the
rich
parsons
of
the
neighbourhood
or
the
justices
who
came
round
now
and
then
and
were
glad
to
ride
up
to
a
warm
farmhouse
or
even
the
welltodo
tradesmen
of
porlockin
a
word
any
settled
power
which
was
afraid
of
losing
thingswith
all
of
them
we
were
very
shy
of
claiming
our
kinship
to
that
great
outlaw
and
sure
i
should
pity
as
well
as
condemn
him
though
our
ways
in
the
world
were
so
different
knowing
as
i
do
his
story
which
knowledge
methinks
would
often
lead
us
to
let
alone
gods
prerogativejudgment
and
hold
by
mans
privilegepity
not
that
i
would
find
excuse
for
toms
downright
dishonesty
which
was
beyond
doubt
a
disgrace
to
him
and
no
credit
to
his
kinsfolk
only
that
it
came
about
without
his
meaning
any
harm
or
seeing
how
he
took
to
wrong
yet
gradually
knowing
it
and
now
to
save
any
further
trouble
and
to
meet
those
who
disparage
him
without
allowance
for
the
time
or
the
crosses
laid
upon
him
i
will
tell
the
history
of
him
just
as
if
he
were
not
my
cousin
and
hoping
to
be
heeded
and
i
defy
any
man
to
say
that
a
word
of
this
is
either
false
or
in
any
way
coloured
by
family
much
cause
he
had
to
be
harsh
with
the
world
and
yet
all
acknowledged
him
very
pleasant
when
a
man
gave
up
his
money
and
often
and
often
he
paid
the
toll
for
the
carriage
coming
after
him
because
he
had
emptied
their
pockets
and
would
not
add
inconvenience
by
trade
he
had
been
a
blacksmith
in
the
town
of
northmolton
in
devonshire
a
rough
rude
place
at
the
end
of
exmoor
so
that
many
people
marvelled
if
such
a
man
was
bred
there
not
only
could
he
read
and
write
but
he
had
solid
substance
a
piece
of
land
worth
a
hundred
pounds
and
right
of
common
for
two
hundred
sheep
and
a
score
and
a
half
of
beasts
lifting
up
or
lying
down
and
being
left
an
orphan
with
all
these
cares
upon
him
he
began
to
work
right
early
and
made
such
a
fame
at
the
shoeing
of
horses
that
the
farriers
of
barum
were
like
to
lose
their
custom
and
indeed
he
won
a
golden
jacobus
for
the
bestshod
nag
in
the
north
of
devon
and
some
say
that
he
never
was
forgiven
as
to
that
i
know
no
more
except
that
men
are
jealous
but
whether
it
were
that
or
not
he
fell
into
bitter
trouble
within
a
month
of
his
victory
when
his
trade
was
growing
upon
him
and
his
sweetheart
ready
to
marry
him
for
he
loved
a
maid
of
southmolton
a
curriers
daughter
i
think
she
was
and
her
name
was
betsy
paramore
and
her
father
had
given
consent
and
tom
faggus
wishing
to
look
his
best
and
be
clean
of
course
had
a
tailor
at
work
upstairs
for
him
who
had
come
all
the
way
from
exeter
and
betsys
things
were
ready
toofor
which
they
accused
him
afterwards
as
if
he
could
help
thatwhen
suddenly
like
a
thunderbolt
a
lawyers
writ
fell
upon
him
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
lawsuit
with
sir
robert
bampfylde
a
gentleman
of
the
neighbourhood
who
tried
to
oust
him
from
his
common
and
drove
his
cattle
and
harassed
them
and
by
that
suit
of
law
poor
tom
was
ruined
altogether
for
sir
robert
could
pay
for
much
swearing
and
then
all
his
goods
and
his
farm
were
sold
up
and
even
his
smithery
taken
but
he
saddled
his
horse
before
they
could
catch
him
and
rode
away
to
southmolton
looking
more
like
a
madman
than
a
good
farrier
as
the
people
said
who
saw
him
but
when
he
arrived
there
instead
of
comfort
they
showed
him
the
face
of
the
door
alone
for
the
news
of
his
loss
was
before
him
and
master
paramore
was
a
sound
prudent
man
and
a
high
member
of
the
town
council
it
is
said
that
they
even
gave
him
notice
to
pay
for
betsys
weddingclothes
now
that
he
was
too
poor
to
marry
her
this
may
be
false
and
indeed
i
doubt
it
in
the
first
place
because
southmolton
is
a
busy
place
for
talking
and
in
the
next
that
i
do
not
think
the
action
would
have
lain
at
law
especially
as
the
maid
lost
nothing
but
used
it
all
for
her
wedding
next
month
with
dick
vellacott
of
mockham
all
this
was
very
sore
upon
tom
and
he
took
it
to
heart
so
grievously
that
he
said
as
a
better
man
might
have
said
being
loose
of
mind
and
property
the
world
hath
preyed
on
me
like
a
wolf
god
help
me
now
to
prey
on
the
world
and
in
sooth
it
did
seem
for
a
while
as
if
providence
were
with
him
for
he
took
rare
toll
on
the
highway
and
his
name
was
soon
as
good
as
gold
anywhere
this
side
of
bristowe
he
studied
his
business
by
night
and
by
day
with
three
horses
all
in
hard
work
until
he
had
made
a
fine
reputation
and
then
it
was
competent
to
him
to
rest
and
he
had
plenty
left
for
charity
and
i
ought
to
say
for
society
too
for
he
truly
loved
high
society
treating
squires
and
noblemen
who
much
affected
his
company
to
the
very
best
fare
of
the
hostel
and
they
say
that
once
the
kings
justitiaries
being
upon
circuit
accepted
his
invitation
declaring
merrily
that
if
never
true
bill
had
been
found
against
him
mine
host
should
now
be
qualified
to
draw
one
and
so
the
landlords
did
and
he
always
paid
them
handsomely
so
that
all
of
them
were
kind
to
him
and
contended
for
his
visits
let
it
be
known
in
any
township
that
mr
faggus
was
taking
his
leisure
at
the
inn
and
straightway
all
the
men
flocked
thither
to
drink
his
health
without
outlay
and
all
the
women
to
admire
him
while
the
children
were
set
at
the
crossroads
to
give
warning
of
any
officers
one
of
his
earliest
meetings
was
with
sir
robert
bampfylde
himself
who
was
riding
along
the
barum
road
with
only
one
servingman
after
him
tom
faggus
put
a
pistol
to
his
head
being
then
obliged
to
be
violent
through
want
of
reputation
while
the
servingman
pretended
to
be
along
way
round
the
corner
then
the
baronet
pulled
out
his
purse
quite
trembling
in
the
hurry
of
his
politeness
tom
took
the
purse
and
his
ring
and
timepiece
and
then
handed
them
back
with
a
very
low
bow
saying
that
it
was
against
all
usage
for
him
to
rob
a
robber
then
he
turned
to
the
unfaithful
knave
and
trounced
him
right
well
for
his
cowardice
and
stripped
him
of
all
his
property
but
now
mr
faggus
kept
only
one
horse
lest
the
government
should
steal
them
and
that
one
was
the
young
mare
winnie
how
he
came
by
her
he
never
would
tell
but
i
think
that
she
was
presented
to
him
by
a
certain
colonel
a
lover
of
sport
and
very
clever
in
horseflesh
whose
life
tom
had
saved
from
some
gamblers
when
i
have
added
that
faggus
as
yet
had
never
been
guilty
of
bloodshed
for
his
eyes
and
the
click
of
his
pistol
at
first
and
now
his
high
reputation
made
all
his
wishes
respected
and
that
he
never
robbed
a
poor
man
neither
insulted
a
woman
but
was
very
good
to
the
church
and
of
hot
patriotic
opinions
and
full
of
jest
and
jollity
i
have
said
as
much
as
is
fair
for
him
and
shown
why
he
was
so
popular
everybody
cursed
the
doones
who
lived
apart
disdainfully
but
all
good
people
liked
mr
fagguswhen
he
had
not
robbed
themand
many
a
poor
sick
man
or
woman
blessed
him
for
other
peoples
money
and
all
the
hostlers
stableboys
and
tapsters
entirely
worshipped
him
i
have
been
rather
long
and
perhaps
tedious
in
my
account
of
him
lest
at
any
time
hereafter
his
character
should
be
misunderstood
and
his
good
name
disparaged
whereas
he
was
my
second
cousin
and
the
lover
of
mybut
let
that
bide
tis
a
melancholy
story
he
came
again
about
three
months
afterwards
in
the
beginning
of
the
springtime
and
brought
me
a
beautiful
new
carbine
having
learned
my
love
of
such
things
and
my
great
desire
to
shoot
straight
but
mother
would
not
let
me
have
the
gun
until
he
averred
upon
his
honour
that
he
had
bought
it
honestly
and
so
he
had
no
doubt
so
far
as
it
is
honest
to
buy
with
money
acquired
rampantly
scarce
could
i
stop
to
make
my
bullets
in
the
mould
which
came
along
with
it
but
must
be
off
to
the
quarry
hill
and
new
target
i
had
made
there
and
he
taught
me
then
how
to
ride
bright
winnie
who
was
grown
since
i
had
seen
her
but
remembered
me
most
kindly
after
making
much
of
annie
who
had
a
wondrous
liking
for
himand
he
said
he
was
her
godfather
but
god
knows
how
he
could
have
been
unless
they
confirmed
him
precociouslyaway
he
went
and
young
winnies
sides
shone
like
a
cherry
by
candlelight
now
i
feel
that
of
those
boyish
days
i
have
little
more
to
tell
because
everything
went
quietly
as
the
world
for
the
most
part
does
with
us
i
began
to
work
at
the
farm
in
earnest
and
tried
to
help
my
mother
and
when
i
remembered
lorna
doone
it
seemed
no
more
than
the
thought
of
a
dream
which
i
could
hardly
call
to
mind
now
who
cares
to
know
how
many
bushels
of
wheat
we
grew
to
the
acre
or
how
the
cattle
milched
till
we
ate
them
or
what
the
turn
of
the
seasons
was
but
my
stupid
self
seemed
like
to
be
the
biggest
of
all
the
cattle
for
having
much
to
look
after
the
sheep
and
being
always
in
kind
appetite
i
grew
four
inches
longer
in
every
year
of
my
farming
and
a
matter
of
two
inches
wider
until
there
was
no
man
of
my
size
to
be
seen
elsewhere
upon
exmoor
let
that
pass
what
odds
to
any
how
tall
or
wide
i
be
there
is
no
doones
door
at
plovers
barrows
and
if
there
were
i
could
never
go
through
it
they
vexed
me
so
much
about
my
size
long
before
i
had
completed
it
girding
at
me
with
paltry
jokes
whose
wit
was
good
only
to
stay
at
home
that
i
grew
shamefaced
about
the
matter
and
feared
to
encounter
a
lookingglass
but
mother
was
very
proud
and
said
she
never
could
have
too
much
of
me
the
worst
of
all
to
make
me
ashamed
of
bearing
my
head
so
higha
thing
i
saw
no
way
to
help
for
i
never
could
hang
my
chin
down
and
my
back
was
like
a
gatepost
whenever
i
tried
to
bend
itthe
worst
of
all
was
our
little
eliza
who
never
could
come
to
a
size
herself
though
she
had
the
wine
from
the
sacrament
at
easter
and
allhallowmas
only
to
be
small
and
skinny
sharp
and
clever
crookedly
not
that
her
body
was
out
of
the
straight
being
too
small
for
that
perhaps
but
that
her
wit
was
full
of
corners
jagged
and
strange
and
uncomfortable
you
never
could
tell
what
she
might
say
next
and
i
like
not
that
kind
of
women
now
god
forgive
me
for
talking
so
of
my
own
fathers
daughter
and
so
much
the
more
by
reason
that
my
father
could
not
help
it
the
right
way
is
to
face
the
matter
and
then
be
sorry
for
every
one
my
mother
fell
grievously
on
a
slide
which
john
fry
had
made
nigh
the
appleroom
door
and
hidden
with
straw
from
the
stable
to
cover
his
own
great
idleness
my
father
laid
johns
nose
on
the
ice
and
kept
him
warm
in
spite
of
it
but
it
was
too
late
for
eliza
she
was
born
next
day
with
more
mind
than
bodythe
worst
thing
that
can
befall
a
man
but
annie
my
other
sister
was
now
a
fine
fair
girl
beautiful
to
behold
i
could
look
at
her
by
the
fireside
for
an
hour
together
when
i
was
not
too
sleepy
and
think
of
my
dear
father
and
she
would
do
the
same
thing
by
me
only
wait
the
between
of
the
blazes
her
hair
was
done
up
in
a
knot
behind
but
some
would
fall
over
her
shoulders
and
the
dancing
of
the
light
was
sweet
to
see
through
a
mans
eyelashes
there
never
was
a
face
that
showed
the
light
or
the
shadow
of
feeling
as
if
the
heart
were
sun
to
it
more
than
our
dear
annies
did
to
look
at
her
carefully
you
might
think
that
she
was
not
dwelling
on
anything
and
then
she
would
know
you
were
looking
at
her
and
those
eyes
would
tell
all
about
it
god
knows
that
i
try
to
be
simple
enough
to
keep
to
his
meaning
in
me
and
not
make
the
worst
of
his
children
yet
often
have
i
been
put
to
shame
and
ready
to
bite
my
tongue
off
after
speaking
amiss
of
anybody
and
letting
out
my
littleness
when
suddenly
mine
eyes
have
met
the
pure
soft
gaze
of
annie
as
for
the
doones
they
were
thriving
still
and
no
one
to
come
against
them
except
indeed
by
word
of
mouth
to
which
they
lent
no
heed
whatever
complaints
were
made
from
time
to
time
both
in
high
and
low
quarters
as
the
rank
might
be
of
the
people
robbed
and
once
or
twice
in
the
highest
of
all
to
wit
the
king
himself
but
his
majesty
made
a
good
joke
about
it
not
meaning
any
harm
i
doubt
and
was
so
much
pleased
with
himself
thereupon
that
he
quite
forgave
the
mischief
moreover
the
main
authorities
were
a
long
way
off
and
the
chancellor
had
no
cattle
on
exmoor
and
as
for
my
lord
the
chief
justice
some
rogue
had
taken
his
silver
spoons
whereupon
his
lordship
swore
that
never
another
man
would
he
hang
until
he
had
that
one
by
the
neck
therefore
the
doones
went
on
as
they
listed
and
none
saw
fit
to
meddle
with
them
for
the
only
man
who
would
have
dared
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
them
that
is
to
say
tom
faggus
himself
was
a
quarry
for
the
law
if
ever
it
should
be
unhooded
moreover
he
had
transferred
his
business
to
the
neighbourhood
of
wantage
in
the
county
of
berks
where
he
found
the
climate
drier
also
good
downs
and
commons
excellent
for
galloping
and
richer
yeomen
than
ours
be
and
better
roads
to
rob
them
on
some
folk
who
had
wiser
attended
to
their
own
affairs
said
that
i
being
sizeable
now
and
able
to
shoot
not
badly
ought
to
do
something
against
those
doones
and
show
what
i
was
made
of
but
for
a
time
i
was
very
bashful
shaking
when
called
upon
suddenly
and
blushing
as
deep
as
a
maiden
for
my
strength
was
not
come
upon
me
and
mayhap
i
had
grown
in
front
of
it
and
again
though
i
loved
my
father
still
and
would
fire
at
a
word
about
him
i
saw
not
how
it
would
do
him
good
for
me
to
harm
his
injurers
some
races
are
of
revengeful
kind
and
will
for
years
pursue
their
wrong
and
sacrifice
this
world
and
the
next
for
a
moments
foul
satisfaction
but
methinks
this
comes
of
some
black
blood
perverted
and
never
purified
and
i
doubt
but
men
of
true
english
birth
are
stouter
than
so
to
be
twisted
though
some
of
the
women
may
take
that
turn
if
their
own
life
runs
unkindly
let
that
passi
am
never
good
at
talking
of
things
beyond
me
all
i
know
is
that
if
i
had
met
the
doone
who
had
killed
my
father
i
would
gladly
have
thrashed
him
black
and
blue
supposing
i
were
able
but
would
never
have
fired
a
gun
at
him
unless
he
began
that
game
with
me
or
fell
upon
more
of
my
family
or
were
violent
among
women
and
to
do
them
justice
my
mother
and
annie
were
equally
kind
and
gentle
but
eliza
would
flame
and
grow
white
with
contempt
and
not
trust
herself
to
speak
to
us
now
a
strange
thing
came
to
pass
that
winter
when
i
was
twentyone
years
old
a
very
strange
thing
which
affrighted
the
rest
and
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
not
that
there
was
anything
in
it
to
do
harm
to
any
one
only
that
none
could
explain
it
except
by
attributing
it
to
the
devil
the
weather
was
very
mild
and
open
and
scarcely
any
snow
fell
at
any
rate
none
lay
on
the
ground
even
for
an
hour
in
the
highest
part
of
exmoor
a
thing
which
i
knew
not
before
nor
since
as
long
as
i
can
remember
but
the
nights
were
wonderfully
dark
as
though
with
no
stars
in
the
heaven
and
all
day
long
the
mists
were
rolling
upon
the
hills
and
down
them
as
if
the
whole
land
were
a
washhouse
the
moorland
was
full
of
snipes
and
teal
and
curlews
flying
and
crying
and
lapwings
flapping
heavily
and
ravens
hovering
round
dead
sheep
yet
no
redshanks
nor
dottrell
and
scarce
any
golden
plovers
of
which
we
have
great
store
generally
but
vast
lonely
birds
that
cried
at
night
and
moved
the
whole
air
with
their
pinions
yet
no
man
ever
saw
them
it
was
dismal
as
well
as
dangerous
now
for
any
man
to
go
fowling
which
of
late
i
loved
much
in
the
winter
because
the
fog
would
come
down
so
thick
that
the
pan
of
the
gun
was
reeking
and
the
fowl
out
of
sight
ere
the
powder
kindled
and
then
the
sound
of
the
piece
was
so
dead
that
the
shooter
feared
harm
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
but
the
danger
of
course
was
far
less
in
this
than
in
losing
of
the
track
and
falling
into
the
mires
or
over
the
brim
of
a
precipice
nevertheless
i
must
needs
go
out
being
young
and
very
stupid
and
feared
of
being
afraid
a
fear
which
a
wise
man
has
long
cast
by
having
learned
of
the
manifold
dangers
which
ever
and
ever
encompass
us
and
beside
this
folly
and
wildness
of
youth
perchance
there
was
something
i
know
not
what
of
the
joy
we
have
in
uncertainty
mother
in
fear
of
my
missing
homethough
for
that
matter
i
could
smell
supper
when
hungry
through
a
hundred
landyards
of
fogmy
dear
mother
who
thought
of
me
ten
times
for
one
thought
about
herself
gave
orders
to
ring
the
great
sheepbell
which
hung
above
the
pigeoncote
every
ten
minutes
of
the
day
and
the
sound
came
through
the
plaits
of
fog
and
i
was
vexed
about
it
like
the
letters
of
a
copybook
it
reminded
me
too
of
blundells
bell
and
the
grief
to
go
into
school
again
but
during
those
two
months
of
fog
for
we
had
it
all
the
winter
the
saddest
and
the
heaviest
thing
was
to
stand
beside
the
sea
to
be
upon
the
beach
yourself
and
see
the
long
waves
coming
in
to
know
that
they
are
long
waves
but
only
see
a
piece
of
them
and
to
hear
them
lifting
roundly
swelling
over
smooth
green
rocks
plashing
down
in
the
hollow
corners
but
bearing
on
all
the
same
as
ever
soft
and
sleek
and
sorrowful
till
their
little
noise
is
over
one
old
man
who
lived
at
lynmouth
seeking
to
be
buried
there
having
been
more
than
half
over
the
world
though
shy
to
speak
about
it
and
fain
to
come
home
to
his
birthplace
this
old
will
watcombe
who
dwelt
by
the
water
said
that
our
strange
winter
arose
from
a
thing
he
called
the
gulfstream
rushing
up
channel
suddenly
he
said
it
was
hot
water
almost
fit
for
a
man
to
shave
with
and
it
threw
all
our
cold
water
out
and
ruined
the
fish
and
the
spawningtime
and
a
cold
spring
would
come
after
it
i
was
fond
of
going
to
lynmouth
on
sunday
to
hear
this
old
man
talk
for
sometimes
he
would
discourse
with
me
when
nobody
else
could
move
him
he
told
me
that
this
powerful
flood
set
in
upon
our
west
so
hard
sometimes
once
in
ten
years
and
sometimes
not
for
fifty
and
the
lord
only
knew
the
sense
of
it
but
that
when
it
came
therewith
came
warmth
and
clouds
and
fog
and
moisture
and
nuts
and
fruit
and
even
shells
and
all
the
tides
were
thrown
abroad
as
for
nuts
he
winked
awhile
and
chewed
a
piece
of
tobacco
yet
did
i
not
comprehend
him
only
afterwards
i
heard
that
nuts
with
liquid
kernels
came
travelling
on
the
gulf
stream
for
never
before
was
known
so
much
foreign
cordial
landed
upon
our
coast
floating
ashore
by
mistake
in
the
fog
and
what
with
the
tossing
and
the
mist
too
much
astray
to
learn
its
duty
folk
who
are
ever
too
prone
to
talk
said
that
will
watcombe
himself
knew
better
than
anybody
else
about
this
drift
of
the
gulfstream
and
the
places
where
it
would
come
ashore
and
the
caves
that
took
the
indraught
but
de
whichehalse
our
great
magistrate
certified
that
there
was
no
proof
of
unlawful
importation
neither
good
cause
to
suspect
it
at
a
time
of
christian
charity
and
we
knew
that
it
was
a
foul
thing
for
some
quarrymen
to
say
that
night
after
night
they
had
been
digging
a
new
cellar
at
ley
manor
to
hold
the
little
marks
of
respect
found
in
the
caverns
at
highwater
weed
let
that
be
it
is
none
of
my
business
to
speak
evil
of
dignities
duly
we
common
people
joked
of
the
gulpstream
as
we
called
it
but
the
thing
which
astonished
and
frightened
us
so
was
not
i
do
assure
you
the
landing
of
foreign
spirits
nor
the
loom
of
a
lugger
at
twilight
in
the
gloom
of
the
winter
moonrise
that
which
made
as
crouch
in
by
the
fire
or
draw
the
bedclothes
over
us
and
try
to
think
of
something
else
was
a
strange
mysterious
sound
at
grey
of
night
when
the
sun
was
gone
and
no
red
in
the
west
remained
neither
were
stars
forthcoming
suddenly
a
wailing
voice
rose
along
the
valleys
and
a
sound
in
the
air
as
of
people
running
it
mattered
not
whether
you
stood
on
the
moor
or
crouched
behind
rocks
away
from
it
or
down
among
reedy
places
all
as
one
the
sound
would
come
now
from
the
heart
of
the
earth
beneath
now
overhead
bearing
down
on
you
and
then
there
was
rushing
of
something
by
and
melancholy
laughter
and
the
hair
of
a
man
would
stand
on
end
before
he
could
reason
properly
god
in
his
mercy
knows
that
i
am
stupid
enough
for
any
man
and
very
slow
of
impression
nor
ever
could
bring
myself
to
believe
that
our
father
would
let
the
evil
one
get
the
upper
hand
of
us
but
when
i
had
heard
that
sound
three
times
in
the
lonely
gloom
of
the
evening
fog
and
the
cold
that
followed
the
lines
of
air
i
was
loath
to
go
abroad
by
night
even
so
far
as
the
stables
and
loved
the
light
of
a
candle
more
and
the
glow
of
a
fire
with
company
there
were
many
stories
about
it
of
course
all
over
the
breadth
of
the
moorland
but
those
who
had
heard
it
most
often
declared
that
it
must
be
the
wail
of
a
womans
voice
and
the
rustle
of
robes
fleeing
horribly
and
fiends
in
the
fog
going
after
her
to
that
however
i
paid
no
heed
when
anybody
was
with
me
only
we
drew
more
close
together
and
barred
the
doors
at
sunset
chapter

master
huckaback
comes
in
mr
reuben
huckaback
whom
many
good
folk
in
dulverton
will
remember
long
after
my
time
was
my
mothers
uncle
being
indeed
her
mothers
brother
he
owned
the
very
best
shop
in
the
town
and
did
a
fine
trade
in
soft
ware
especially
when
the
packhorses
came
safely
in
at
christmastime
and
we
being
now
his
only
kindred
except
indeed
his
granddaughter
little
ruth
huckaback
of
whom
no
one
took
any
heed
mother
beheld
it
a
christian
duty
to
keep
as
well
as
could
be
with
him
both
for
love
of
a
nice
old
man
and
for
the
sake
of
her
children
and
truly
the
dulverton
people
said
that
he
was
the
richest
man
in
their
town
and
could
buy
up
half
the
county
armigers
ay
and
if
it
came
to
that
they
would
like
to
see
any
man
at
bampton
or
at
wivelscombe
and
you
might
say
almost
taunton
who
could
put
down
golden
jacobus
and
carolus
against
him
now
this
old
gentlemanso
they
called
him
according
to
his
money
and
i
have
seen
many
worse
ones
more
violent
and
less
wealthyhe
must
needs
come
away
that
time
to
spend
the
new
yeartide
with
us
not
that
he
wanted
to
do
it
for
he
hated
countrylife
but
because
my
mother
pressing
as
mothers
will
do
to
a
good
bag
of
gold
had
wrung
a
promise
from
him
and
the
only
boast
of
his
life
was
that
never
yet
had
he
broken
his
word
at
least
since
he
opened
business
now
it
pleased
god
that
christmastime
in
spite
of
all
the
fogs
to
send
safe
home
to
dulverton
and
what
was
more
with
their
loads
quite
safe
a
goodly
string
of
packhorses
nearly
half
of
their
charge
was
for
uncle
reuben
and
he
knew
how
to
make
the
most
of
it
then
having
balanced
his
debits
and
credits
and
set
the
writs
running
against
defaulters
as
behoves
a
good
christian
at
christmastide
he
saddled
his
horse
and
rode
off
towards
oare
with
a
good
stout
coat
upon
him
and
leaving
ruth
and
his
head
man
plenty
to
do
and
little
to
eat
until
they
should
see
him
again
it
had
been
settled
between
us
that
we
should
expect
him
soon
after
noon
on
the
last
day
of
december
for
the
doones
being
lazy
and
fond
of
bed
as
the
manner
is
of
dishonest
folk
the
surest
way
to
escape
them
was
to
travel
before
they
were
up
and
about
towit
in
the
forenoon
of
the
day
but
herein
we
reckoned
without
our
host
for
being
in
high
festivity
as
became
good
papists
the
robbers
were
too
lazy
it
seems
to
take
the
trouble
of
going
to
bed
and
forth
they
rode
on
the
old
yearmorning
not
with
any
view
of
business
but
purely
in
search
of
mischief
we
had
put
off
our
dinner
till
one
oclock
which
to
me
was
a
sad
foregoing
and
there
was
to
be
a
brave
supper
at
six
of
the
clock
upon
new
yearseve
and
the
singers
to
come
with
their
lanthorns
and
do
it
outside
the
parlourwindow
and
then
have
hot
cup
till
their
heads
should
go
round
after
making
away
with
the
victuals
for
although
there
was
nobody
now
in
our
family
to
be
churchwarden
of
oare
it
was
well
admitted
that
we
were
the
people
entitled
alone
to
that
dignity
and
though
nicholas
snowe
was
in
office
by
name
he
managed
it
only
by
mothers
advice
and
a
pretty
mess
he
made
of
it
so
that
every
one
longed
for
a
ridd
again
soon
as
ever
i
should
be
old
enough
this
nicholas
snowe
was
to
come
in
the
evening
with
his
three
tall
comely
daughters
strapping
girls
and
well
skilled
in
the
dairy
and
the
story
was
all
over
the
parish
on
a
stupid
conceit
of
john
frys
that
i
should
have
been
in
love
with
all
three
if
there
had
been
but
one
of
them
these
snowes
were
to
come
and
come
they
did
partly
because
mr
huckaback
liked
to
see
fine
young
maidens
and
partly
because
none
but
nicholas
snowe
could
smoke
a
pipe
now
all
around
our
parts
except
of
the
very
high
people
whom
we
durst
never
invite
and
uncle
ben
as
we
all
knew
well
was
a
great
hand
at
his
pipe
and
would
sit
for
hours
over
it
in
our
warm
chimneycorner
and
never
want
to
say
a
word
unless
it
were
inside
him
only
he
liked
to
have
somebody
there
over
against
him
smoking
now
when
i
came
in
before
one
oclock
after
seeing
to
the
cattlefor
the
day
was
thicker
than
ever
and
we
must
keep
the
cattle
close
at
home
if
we
wished
to
see
any
more
of
themi
fully
expected
to
find
uncle
ben
sitting
in
the
fireplace
lifting
one
cover
and
then
another
as
his
favourite
manner
was
and
making
sweet
mouths
over
them
for
he
loved
our
bacon
rarely
and
they
had
no
good
leeks
at
dulverton
and
he
was
a
man
who
always
would
see
his
business
done
himself
but
there
instead
of
my
finding
him
with
his
quaint
dry
face
pulled
out
at
me
and
then
shut
up
sharp
not
to
be
cheatedwho
should
run
out
but
betty
muxworthy
and
poke
me
with
a
saucepan
lid
get
out
of
that
now
betty
i
said
in
my
politest
manner
for
really
betty
was
now
become
a
great
domestic
evil
she
would
have
her
own
way
so
and
of
all
things
the
most
distressful
was
for
a
man
to
try
to
reason
ziderpress
cried
betty
again
for
she
thought
it
a
fine
joke
to
call
me
that
because
of
my
size
and
my
hatred
of
it
here
be
a
rare
get
up
anyhow
a
rare
good
dinner
you
mean
betty
well
and
i
have
a
rare
good
appetite
with
that
i
wanted
to
go
and
smell
it
and
not
to
stop
for
betty
troost
thee
for
thiccy
jan
ridd
but
thee
must
keep
it
bit
langer
i
reckon

coom
maister
ziderpress
whatte

of
that
now
do
you
mean
to
say
that
uncle
ben
has
not
arrived
yet
betty
raived
i
knaws
nout
about

and
betty
who
hated
uncle
ben
because
he
never
gave
her
a
groat
and
she
was
not
allowed
to
dine
with
him
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
betty
muxworthy
grinned
all
across
and
poked
me
again
with
the
greasy
saucepan
cover
but
i
misliking
so
to
be
treated
strode
through
the
kitchen
indignantly
for
betty
behaved
to
me
even
now
as
if
i
were
only
eliza
oh
johnny
johnny
my
mother
cried
running
out
of
the
grand
showparlour
where
the
case
of
stuffed
birds
was
and
peacockfeathers
and
the
white
hare
killed
by
grandfather
i
am
so
glad
you
are
come
at
last
there
is
something
sadly
amiss
johnny
mother
had
upon
her
wrists
something
very
wonderful
of
the
nature
of
fallal
as
we
say
and
for
which
she
had
an
inborn
turn
being
of
good
draper
family
and
polished
above
the
yeomanry
nevertheless
i
could
never
bear
it
partly
because
i
felt
it
to
be
out
of
place
in
our
good
farmhouse
partly
because
i
hate
frippery
partly
because
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
father
and
partly
because
i
never
could
tell
the
reason
of
my
hating
it
and
yet
the
poor
soul
had
put
them
on
not
to
show
her
hands
off
which
were
above
her
station
but
simply
for
her
childrens
sake
because
uncle
ben
had
given
them
but
another
thing
i
never
could
bear
for
man
or
woman
to
call
me
johnny
jack
or
john
i
cared
not
which
and
that
was
honest
enough
and
no
smallness
of
me
there
i
say
well
mother
what
is
the
matter
then
i
am
sure
you
need
not
be
angry
johnny
i
only
hope
it
is
nothing
to
grieve
about
instead
of
being
angry
you
are
very
sweettempered
i
know
john
ridd
and
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
at
timeshere
she
meant
the
snowe
girls
and
i
hanged
my
headbut
what
would
you
say
if
the
people
thereshe
never
would
call
them
dooneshad
gotten
your
poor
uncle
reuben
horse
and
sunday
coat
and
all
why
mother
i
should
be
sorry
for
them
he
would
set
up
a
shop
by
the
riverside
and
come
away
with
all
their
money
that
all
you
have
to
say
john
and
my
dinner
done
to
a
very
turn
and
the
supper
all
fit
to
go
down
and
no
worry
only
to
eat
and
be
done
with
it
and
all
the
new
plates
come
from
watchett
with
the
watchett
blue
upon
them
at
the
risk
of
the
lives
of
everybody
and
the
capias
from
good
aunt
jane
for
stuffing
a
curlew
with
onion
before
he
begins
to
get
cold
and
make
a
woodcock
of
him
and
the
way
to
turn
the
flap
over
in
the
inside
of
a
roasting
pig
well
mother
dear
i
am
very
sorry
but
let
us
have
our
dinner
you
know
we
promised
not
to
wait
for
him
after
one
oclock
and
you
only
make
us
hungry
everything
will
be
spoiled
mother
and
what
a
pity
to
think
of
after
that
i
will
go
to
seek
for
him
in
the
thick
of
the
fog
like
a
needle
in
a
hayband
that
is
to
say
unless
you
thinkfor
she
looked
very
grave
about
itunless
you
really
think
mother
that
i
ought
to
go
without
dinner
oh
no
john
i
never
thought
that
thank
god
bless
him
for
my
childrens
appetites
and
what
is
uncle
ben
to
them
so
we
made
a
very
good
dinner
indeed
though
wishing
that
he
could
have
some
of
it
and
wondering
how
much
to
leave
for
him
and
then
as
no
sound
of
his
horse
had
been
heard
i
set
out
with
my
gun
to
look
for
him
i
followed
the
track
on
the
side
of
the
hill
from
the
farmyard
where
the
sleddmarks
arefor
we
have
no
wheels
upon
exmoor
yet
nor
ever
shall
i
suppose
though
a
dunderheaded
man
tried
it
last
winter
and
broke
his
axle
piteously
and
was
nigh
to
break
his
neckand
after
that
i
went
all
along
on
the
ridge
of
the
rabbitcleve
with
the
brook
running
thin
in
the
bottom
and
then
down
to
the
lynn
stream
and
leaped
it
and
so
up
the
hill
and
the
moor
beyond
the
fog
hung
close
all
around
me
then
when
i
turned
the
crest
of
the
highland
and
the
gorse
both
before
and
behind
me
looked
like
a
man
crouching
down
in
ambush
but
still
there
was
a
good
cloud
of
daylight
being
scarce
three
of
the
clock
yet
and
when
a
lead
of
red
deer
came
across
i
could
tell
them
from
sheep
even
now
i
was
half
inclined
to
shoot
at
them
for
the
children
did
love
venison
but
they
drooped
their
heads
so
and
looked
so
faithful
that
it
seemed
hard
measure
to
do
it
if
one
of
them
had
bolted
away
no
doubt
i
had
let
go
at
him
after
that
i
kept
on
the
track
trudging
very
stoutly
for
nigh
upon
three
miles
and
my
beard
now
beginning
to
grow
at
some
length
was
full
of
great
drops
and
prickly
whereat
i
was
very
proud
i
had
not
so
much
as
a
dog
with
me
and
the
place
was
unkind
and
lonesome
and
the
rolling
clouds
very
desolate
and
now
if
a
wild
sheep
ran
across
he
was
scared
at
me
as
an
enemy
and
i
for
my
part
could
not
tell
the
meaning
of
the
marks
on
him
we
called
all
this
part
gibbetmoor
not
being
in
our
parish
but
though
there
were
gibbets
enough
upon
it
most
part
of
the
bodies
was
gone
for
the
value
of
the
chains
they
said
and
the
teaching
of
young
chirurgeons
but
of
all
this
i
had
little
fear
being
no
more
a
schoolboy
now
but
a
youth
wellacquaint
with
exmoor
and
the
wise
art
of
the
signposts
whereby
a
man
who
barred
the
road
now
opens
it
up
both
ways
with
his
fingerbones
so
far
as
rogues
allow
him
my
carbine
was
loaded
and
freshly
primed
and
i
knew
myself
to
be
even
now
a
match
in
strength
for
any
two
men
of
the
size
around
our
neighbourhood
except
in
the
glen
doone
girt
jan
ridd
i
was
called
already
and
folk
grew
feared
to
wrestle
with
me
though
i
was
tired
of
hearing
about
it
and
often
longed
to
be
smaller
and
most
of
all
upon
sundays
when
i
had
to
make
way
up
our
little
church
and
the
maidens
tittered
at
me
the
soft
white
mist
came
thicker
around
me
as
the
evening
fell
and
the
peat
ricks
here
and
there
and
the
furzehucks
of
the
summertime
were
all
out
of
shape
in
the
twist
of
it
byandby
i
began
to
doubt
where
i
was
or
how
come
there
not
having
seen
a
gibbet
lately
and
then
i
heard
the
draught
of
the
wind
up
a
hollow
place
with
rocks
to
it
and
for
the
first
time
fear
broke
out
like
cold
sweat
upon
me
and
yet
i
knew
what
a
fool
i
was
to
fear
nothing
but
a
sound
but
when
i
stopped
to
listen
there
was
no
sound
more
than
a
beating
noise
and
that
was
all
inside
me
therefore
i
went
on
again
making
company
of
myself
and
keeping
my
gun
quite
ready
now
when
i
came
to
an
unknown
place
where
a
stone
was
set
up
endwise
with
a
faint
red
cross
upon
it
and
a
polish
from
some
conflict
i
gathered
my
courage
to
stop
and
think
having
sped
on
the
way
too
hotly
against
that
stone
i
set
my
gun
trying
my
spirit
to
leave
it
so
but
keeping
with
half
a
hand
for
it
and
then
what
to
do
next
was
the
wonder
as
for
finding
uncle
ben
that
was
his
own
business
or
at
any
rate
his
executors
first
i
had
to
find
myself
and
plentifully
would
thank
god
to
find
myself
at
home
again
for
the
sake
of
all
our
family
the
volumes
of
the
mist
came
rolling
at
me
like
great
logs
of
wood
pillowed
out
with
sleepiness
and
between
them
there
was
nothing
more
than
waiting
for
the
next
one
then
everything
went
out
of
sight
and
glad
was
i
of
the
stone
behind
me
and
view
of
mine
own
shoes
then
a
distant
noise
went
by
me
as
of
many
horses
galloping
and
in
my
fright
i
set
my
gun
and
said
god
send
something
to
shoot
at
yet
nothing
came
and
my
gun
fell
back
without
my
will
to
lower
it
but
presently
while
i
was
thinking
what
a
fool
i
am
arose
as
if
from
below
my
feet
so
that
the
great
stone
trembled
that
long
lamenting
lonesome
sound
as
of
an
evil
spirit
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
for
the
moment
i
stood
like
a
root
without
either
hand
or
foot
to
help
me
and
the
hair
of
my
head
began
to
crawl
lifting
my
hat
as
a
snail
lifts
his
house
and
my
heart
like
a
shuttle
went
to
and
fro
but
finding
no
harm
to
come
of
it
neither
visible
form
approaching
i
wiped
my
forehead
and
hoped
for
the
best
and
resolved
to
run
every
step
of
the
way
till
i
drew
our
own
latch
behind
me
yet
here
again
i
was
disappointed
for
no
sooner
was
i
come
to
the
crossways
by
the
black
pool
in
the
hole
but
i
heard
through
the
patter
of
my
own
feet
a
rough
low
sound
very
close
in
the
fog
as
of
a
hobbled
sheep
acoughing
i
listened
and
feared
and
yet
listened
again
though
i
wanted
not
to
hear
it
for
being
in
haste
of
the
homeward
road
and
all
my
heart
having
heels
to
it
loath
i
was
to
stop
in
the
dusk
for
the
sake
of
an
aged
wether
yet
partly
my
love
of
all
animals
and
partly
my
fear
of
the
farmers
disgrace
compelled
me
to
go
to
the
succour
and
the
noise
was
coming
nearer
a
dry
short
wheezing
sound
it
was
barred
with
coughs
and
want
of
breath
but
thus
i
made
the
meaning
of
it
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
upon
my
soul
have
mercy
an
if
i
cheated
sam
hicks
last
week
lord
knowest
how
well
he
deserved
it
and
lied
in
every
stockings
mouthoh
lord
where
be
i
agoing
these
words
with
many
jogs
between
them
came
to
me
through
the
darkness
and
then
a
long
groan
and
a
choking
i
made
towards
the
sound
as
nigh
as
ever
i
could
guess
and
presently
was
met
pointblank
by
the
head
of
a
mountainpony
upon
its
back
lay
a
man
bound
down
with
his
feet
on
the
neck
and
his
head
to
the
tail
and
his
arms
falling
down
like
stirrups
the
wild
little
nag
was
scared
of
its
life
by
the
unaccustomed
burden
and
had
been
tossing
and
rolling
hard
in
desire
to
get
ease
of
it
before
the
little
horse
could
turn
i
caught
him
jaded
as
he
was
by
his
wet
and
grizzled
forelock
and
he
saw
that
it
was
vain
to
struggle
but
strove
to
bite
me
none
the
less
until
i
smote
him
upon
the
nose
good
and
worthy
sir
i
said
to
the
man
who
was
riding
so
roughly
fear
nothing
no
harm
shall
come
to
thee
help
good
friend
whoever
thou
art
he
gasped
but
could
not
look
at
me
because
his
neck
was
jerked
so
god
hath
sent
thee
and
not
to
rob
me
because
it
is
done
already
what
uncle
ben
i
cried
letting
go
the
horse
in
amazement
that
the
richest
man
in
dulvertonuncle
ben
here
in
this
plight
what
mr
reuben
huckaback
an
honest
hosier
and
draper
serge
and
longcloth
warehousemanhe
groaned
from
rib
to
ribat
the
sign
of
the
gartered
kitten
in
the
loyal
town
of
dulverton
for
gods
sake
let
me
down
good
fellow
from
this
accursed
marrowbone
and
a
groat
of
good
money
will
i
pay
thee
safe
in
my
house
to
dulverton
but
take
notice
that
the
horse
is
mine
no
less
than
the
nag
they
robbed
from
me
what
uncle
ben
dost
thou
not
know
me
thy
dutiful
nephew
john
ridd
not
to
make
a
long
story
of
it
i
cut
the
thongs
that
bound
him
and
set
him
astride
on
the
little
horse
but
he
was
too
weak
to
stay
so
therefore
i
mounted
him
on
my
back
turning
the
horse
into
horsesteps
and
leading
the
pony
by
the
cords
which
i
fastened
around
his
nose
set
out
for
plovers
barrows
uncle
ben
went
fast
asleep
on
my
back
being
jaded
and
shaken
beyond
his
strength
for
a
man
of
threescore
and
five
and
as
soon
he
felt
assured
of
safety
he
would
talk
no
more
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
snored
so
loudly
that
i
could
almost
believe
that
fearful
noise
in
the
fog
every
night
came
all
the
way
from
dulverton
now
as
soon
as
ever
i
brought
him
in
we
set
him
up
in
the
chimneycorner
comfortable
and
handsome
and
it
was
no
little
delight
to
me
to
get
him
off
my
back
for
like
his
own
fortune
uncle
ben
was
of
a
good
round
figure
he
gave
his
long
coat
a
shake
or
two
and
he
stamped
about
in
the
kitchen
until
he
was
sure
of
his
whereabouts
and
then
he
fell
asleep
again
until
supper
should
be
ready
he
shall
marry
ruth
he
said
byandby
to
himself
and
not
to
me
he
shall
marry
ruth
for
this
and
have
my
little
savings
soon
as
they
be
worth
the
having
very
little
as
yet
very
little
indeed
and
ever
so
much
gone
today
along
of
them
rascal
robbers
my
mother
made
a
dreadful
stir
of
course
about
uncle
ben
being
in
such
a
plight
as
this
so
i
left
him
to
her
care
and
annies
and
soon
they
fed
him
rarely
while
i
went
out
to
see
to
the
comfort
of
the
captured
pony
and
in
truth
he
was
worth
the
catching
and
served
us
very
well
afterwards
though
uncle
ben
was
inclined
to
claim
him
for
his
business
at
dulverton
where
they
have
carts
and
that
like
but
i
said
you
shall
have
him
sir
and
welcome
if
you
will
only
ride
him
home
as
first
i
found
you
riding
him
and
with
that
he
dropped
it
a
very
strange
old
man
he
was
short
in
his
manner
though
long
of
body
glad
to
do
the
contrary
things
to
what
any
one
expected
of
him
and
always
looking
sharp
at
people
as
if
he
feared
to
be
cheated
this
surprised
me
much
at
first
because
it
showed
his
ignorance
of
what
we
farmers
arean
upright
race
as
you
may
find
scarcely
ever
cheating
indeed
except
upon
marketday
and
even
then
no
more
than
may
be
helped
by
reason
of
buyers
expecting
it
now
our
simple
ways
were
a
puzzle
to
him
as
i
told
him
very
often
but
he
only
laughed
and
rubbed
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
dry
shining
hand
and
i
think
he
shortly
began
to
languish
for
want
of
some
one
to
higgle
with
i
had
a
great
mind
to
give
him
the
pony
because
he
thought
himself
cheated
in
that
case
only
he
would
conclude
that
i
did
it
with
some
view
to
a
legacy
of
course
the
doones
and
nobody
else
had
robbed
good
uncle
reuben
and
then
they
grew
sportive
and
took
his
horse
an
especially
sober
nag
and
bound
the
master
upon
the
wild
one
for
a
little
change
as
they
told
him
for
two
or
three
hours
they
had
fine
enjoyment
chasing
him
through
the
fog
and
making
much
sport
of
his
groanings
and
then
waxing
hungry
they
went
their
way
and
left
him
to
opportunity
now
mr
huckaback
growing
able
to
walk
in
a
few
days
time
became
thereupon
impatient
and
could
not
be
brought
to
understand
why
he
should
have
been
robbed
at
all
i
have
never
deserved
it
he
said
to
himself
not
knowing
much
of
providence
except
with
a
small
p
to
it
i
have
never
deserved
it
and
will
not
stand
it
in
the
name
of
our
lord
the
king
not
i
at
other
times
he
would
burst
forth
thus
threescore
years
and
five
have
i
lived
an
honest
and
laborious
life
yet
never
was
i
robbed
before
and
now
to
be
robbed
in
my
old
age
to
be
robbed
for
the
first
time
now
thereupon
of
course
we
would
tell
him
how
truly
thankful
he
ought
to
be
for
never
having
been
robbed
before
in
spite
of
living
so
long
in
this
world
and
that
he
was
taking
a
very
ungrateful
not
to
say
ungracious
view
in
thus
repining
and
feeling
aggrieved
when
anyone
else
would
have
knelt
and
thanked
god
for
enjoying
so
long
an
immunity
but
say
what
we
would
it
was
all
as
one
uncle
ben
stuck
fast
to
it
that
he
had
nothing
to
thank
god
for
chapter
xiv
a
motion
which
ends
in
a
mull
instead
of
minding
his
newyear
pudding
master
huckaback
carried
on
so
about
his
mighty
grievance
that
at
last
we
began
to
think
there
must
be
something
in
it
after
all
especially
as
he
assured
us
that
choice
and
costly
presents
for
the
young
people
of
our
household
were
among
the
goods
divested
but
mother
told
him
her
children
had
plenty
and
wanted
no
gold
and
silver
and
little
eliza
spoke
up
and
said
you
can
give
us
the
pretty
things
uncle
ben
when
we
come
in
the
summer
to
see
you
our
mother
reproved
eliza
for
this
although
it
was
the
heel
of
her
own
foot
and
then
to
satisfy
our
uncle
she
promised
to
call
farmer
nicholas
snowe
to
be
of
our
council
that
evening
and
if
the
young
maidens
would
kindly
come
without
taking
thought
to
smoothe
themselves
why
it
would
be
all
the
merrier
and
who
knew
but
what
uncle
huckaback
might
bless
the
day
of
his
robbery
etc
etcand
thorough
good
honest
girls
they
were
fit
helpmates
either
for
shop
or
farm
all
of
which
was
meant
for
me
but
i
stuck
to
my
platter
and
answered
not
in
the
evening
farmer
snowe
came
up
leading
his
daughters
after
him
like
fillies
trimmed
for
a
fair
and
uncle
ben
who
had
not
seen
them
on
the
night
of
his
mishap
because
word
had
been
sent
to
stop
them
was
mightily
pleased
and
very
pleasant
according
to
his
town
bred
ways
the
damsels
had
seen
good
company
and
soon
got
over
their
fear
of
his
wealth
and
played
him
a
number
of
merry
pranks
which
made
our
mother
quite
jealous
for
annie
who
was
always
shy
and
diffident
however
when
the
hot
cup
was
done
and
before
the
mulled
wine
was
ready
we
packed
all
the
maidens
in
the
parlour
and
turned
the
key
upon
them
and
then
we
drew
near
to
the
kitchen
fire
to
hear
uncle
bens
proposal
farmer
snowe
sat
up
in
the
corner
caring
little
to
bear
about
anything
but
smoking
slowly
and
nodding
backward
like
a
sheepdog
dreaming
mother
was
in
the
settle
of
course
knitting
hard
as
usual
and
uncle
ben
took
to
a
threelegged
stool
as
if
all
but
that
had
been
thieved
from
him
howsoever
he
kept
his
breath
from
speech
giving
privilege
as
was
due
to
mother
master
snowe
you
are
well
assured
said
mother
colouring
like
the
furze
as
it
took
the
flame
and
fell
over
that
our
kinsman
here
hath
received
rough
harm
on
his
peaceful
journey
from
dulverton
the
times
are
bad
as
we
all
know
well
and
there
is
no
sign
of
bettering
them
and
if
i
could
see
our
lord
the
king
i
might
say
things
to
move
him
nevertheless
i
have
had
so
much
of
my
own
account
to
vex
for
you
are
flying
out
of
the
subject
sarah
said
uncle
ben
seeing
tears
in
her
eyes
and
tired
of
that
matter
zettle
the
pralimbinaries
spoke
farmer
snowe
on
appeal
from
us
virst
zettle
the
pralimbinaries
and
then
us
knows
what
be
drivin
at
preliminaries

damned
sir
cried
uncle
ben
losing
his
temper
what
preliminaries
were
there
when
i
was
robbed
i
should
like
to
know
robbed
in
this
parish
as
i
can
prove
to
the
eternal
disgrace
of
oare
and
the
scandal
of
all
england
and
i
hold
this
parish
to
answer
for
it
sir
this
parish
shall
make
it
good
being
a
nest
of
foul
thieves
as
it
is
ay
farmers
and
yeomen
and
all
of
you
i
will
beggar
every
man
in
this
parish
if
they
be
not
beggars
already
ay
and
sell
your
old
church
up
before
your
eyes
but
what
i
will
have
back
my
tarlatan
timepiece
saddle
and
dovetailed
nag
mother
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
farmer
snowe
and
we
all
were
sorry
for
master
huckaback
putting
our
hands
up
one
to
another
that
nobody
should
browbeat
him
because
we
all
knew
what
our
parish
was
and
none
the
worse
for
strong
language
however
rich
the
man
might
be
but
uncle
ben
took
it
in
a
different
way
he
thought
that
we
all
were
afraid
of
him
and
that
oare
parish
was
but
as
moab
or
edom
for
him
to
cast
his
shoe
over
nephew
jack
he
cried
looking
at
me
when
i
was
thinking
what
to
say
and
finding
only
emptiness
you
are
a
heavy
lout
sir
a
bumpkin
a
clodhopper
and
i
shall
leave
you
nothing
unless
it
be
my
boots
to
grease
well
uncle
i
made
answer
i
will
grease
your
boots
all
the
same
for
that
so
long
as
you
be
our
guest
sir
now
that
answer
made
without
a
thought
stood
me
for
two
thousand
pounds
as
you
shall
see
byandby
perhaps
as
for
the
parish
my
mother
cried
being
too
hard
set
to
contain
herself
the
parish
can
defend
itself
and
we
may
leave
it
to
do
so
but
our
jack
is
not
like
that
sir
and
i
will
not
have
him
spoken
of
leave
him
indeed
who
wants
you
to
do
more
than
to
leave
him
alone
sir
as
he
might
have
done
you
the
other
night
and
as
no
one
else
would
have
dared
to
do
and
after
that
to
think
so
meanly
of
me
and
of
my
children
hoity
toity
sarah
your
children
i
suppose
are
the
same
as
other
peoples
that
they
are
not
and
never
will
be
and
you
ought
to
know
it
uncle
reuben
if
any
one
in
the
world
ought
other
peoples
children
well
well
uncle
reuben
answered
i
know
very
little
of
children
except
my
little
ruth
and
she
is
nothing
wonderful
i
never
said
that
my
children
were
wonderful
uncle
ben
nor
did
i
ever
think
it
but
as
for
being
good
here
mother
fetched
out
her
handkerchief
being
overcome
by
our
goodness
and
i
told
her
with
my
hand
to
my
mouth
not
to
notice
him
though
he
might
be
worth
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
pounds
but
farmer
snowe
came
forward
now
for
he
had
some
sense
sometimes
and
he
thought
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
say
a
word
for
the
parish
maister
huckaback
he
began
pointing
with
his
pipe
at
him
the
end
that
was
done
in
sealingwax
tooching
of
what
you
was
plaized
to
zay
bout
this
here
parish
and
no
oother
mind
me
no
oother
parish
but
thees
i
use
the
vreedom
zur
for
to
tell
e
that
thee
be
a
laiar
then
farmer
nicholas
snowe
folded
his
arms
across
with
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
on
the
upper
one
and
gave
me
a
nod
and
then
one
to
mother
to
testify
how
he
had
done
his
duty
and
recked
not
what
might
come
of
it
however
he
got
little
thanks
from
us
for
the
parish
was
nothing
at
all
to
my
mother
compared
with
her
childrens
interests
and
i
thought
it
hard
that
an
uncle
of
mine
and
an
old
man
too
should
be
called
a
liar
by
a
visitor
at
our
fireplace
for
we
in
our
rude
part
of
the
world
counted
it
one
of
the
worst
disgraces
that
could
befall
a
man
to
receive
the
lie
from
any
one
but
uncle
ben
as
it
seems
was
used
to
it
in
the
way
of
trade
just
as
people
of
fashion
are
by
a
style
of
courtesy
therefore
the
old
man
only
looked
with
pity
at
farmer
nicholas
and
with
a
sort
of
sorrow
too
reflecting
how
much
he
might
have
made
in
a
bargain
with
such
a
customer
so
ignorant
and
hotheaded
now
let
us
bandy
words
no
more
said
mother
very
sweetly
nothing
is
easier
than
sharp
words
except
to
wish
them
unspoken
as
i
do
many
and
manys
the
time
when
i
think
of
my
good
husband
but
now
let
us
hear
from
uncle
reuben
what
he
would
have
us
do
to
remove
this
disgrace
from
amongst
us
and
to
satisfy
him
of
his
goods
i
care
not
for
my
goods
woman
master
huckaback
answered
grandly
although
they
were
of
large
value
about
them
i
say
nothing
but
what
i
demand
is
this
the
punishment
of
those
scoundrels
zober
man
zober
cried
farmer
nicholas
we
be
too
naigh
badgery
ood
to
spake
like
that
of
they
dooneses
pack
of
cowards
said
uncle
reuben
looking
first
at
the
door
however
much
chance
i
see
of
getting
redress
from
the
valour
of
this
exmoor
and
you
master
snowe
the
very
man
whom
i
looked
to
to
raise
the
country
and
take
the
lead
as
churchwardenwhy
my
youngest
shopman
would
match
his
ell
against
you
pack
of
cowards
cried
uncle
ben
rising
and
shaking
his
lappets
at
us
dont
pretend
to
answer
me
shake
you
all
off
that
i
donothing
more
to
do
with
you
we
knew
it
useless
to
answer
him
and
conveyed
our
knowledge
to
one
another
without
anything
to
vex
him
however
when
the
mulled
wine
was
come
and
a
good
deal
of
it
gone
the
season
being
epiphany
uncle
reuben
began
to
think
that
he
might
have
been
too
hard
with
us
moreover
he
was
beginning
now
to
respect
farmer
nicholas
bravely
because
of
the
way
he
had
smoked
his
pipes
and
the
little
noise
made
over
them
and
lizzie
and
annie
were
doing
their
bestfor
now
we
had
let
the
girls
outto
wake
more
lightsome
uproar
also
young
faith
snowe
was
toward
to
keep
the
old
mens
cups
aflow
and
hansel
them
to
their
liking
so
at
the
close
of
our
entertainment
when
the
girls
were
gone
away
to
fetch
and
light
their
lanthorns
over
which
they
made
rare
noise
blowing
each
the
others
out
for
counting
of
the
sparks
to
come
master
huckaback
stood
up
without
much
aid
from
the
crocksaw
and
looked
at
mother
and
all
of
us
let
no
one
leave
this
place
said
he
until
i
have
said
what
i
want
to
say
for
saving
of
illwill
among
us
and
growth
of
cheer
and
comfort
may
be
i
have
carried
things
too
far
even
to
the
bounds
of
churlishness
and
beyond
the
bounds
of
good
manners
i
will
not
unsay
one
word
i
have
said
having
never
yet
done
so
in
my
life
but
i
would
alter
the
manner
of
it
and
set
it
forth
in
this
light
if
you
folks
upon
exmoor
here
are
loath
and
wary
at
fighting
yet
you
are
brave
at
better
stuff
the
best
and
kindest
i
ever
knew
in
the
matter
of
feeding
here
he
sat
down
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
called
for
a
little
mulled
bastard
all
the
maids
who
were
now
come
back
raced
to
get
it
for
him
but
annie
of
course
was
foremost
and
herein
ended
the
expedition
a
perilous
and
a
great
one
against
the
doones
of
bagworthy
an
enterprise
over
which
we
had
all
talked
plainly
more
than
was
good
for
us
for
my
part
i
slept
well
that
night
feeling
myself
at
home
again
now
that
the
fighting
was
put
aside
and
the
fear
of
it
turned
to
the
comfort
of
talking
what
we
would
have
done
chapter
xv
master
huckaback
fails
of
warrant
on
the
following
day
master
huckaback
with
some
show
of
mystery
demanded
from
my
mother
an
escort
into
a
dangerous
part
of
the
world
to
which
his
business
compelled
him
my
mother
made
answer
to
this
that
he
was
kindly
welcome
to
take
our
john
fry
with
him
at
which
the
good
clothier
laughed
and
said
that
john
was
nothing
like
big
enough
but
another
john
must
serve
his
turn
not
only
for
his
size
but
because
if
he
were
carried
away
no
stone
would
be
left
unturned
upon
exmoor
until
he
should
be
brought
back
again
hereupon
my
mother
grew
very
pale
and
found
fifty
reasons
against
my
going
each
of
them
weightier
than
the
true
one
as
eliza
who
was
jealous
of
me
managed
to
whisper
to
annie
on
the
other
hand
i
was
quite
resolved
directly
the
thing
was
mentioned
to
see
uncle
reuben
through
with
it
and
it
added
much
to
my
selfesteem
to
be
the
guard
of
so
rich
a
man
therefore
i
soon
persuaded
mother
with
her
head
upon
my
breast
to
let
me
go
and
trust
in
god
and
after
that
i
was
greatly
vexed
to
find
that
this
dangerous
enterprise
was
nothing
more
than
a
visit
to
the
baron
de
whichehalse
to
lay
an
information
and
sue
a
warrant
against
the
doones
and
a
posse
to
execute
it
stupid
as
i
always
have
been
and
must
ever
be
no
doubt
i
could
well
have
told
uncle
reuben
that
his
journey
was
no
wiser
than
that
of
the
men
of
gotham
that
he
never
would
get
from
hugh
de
whichehalse
a
warrant
against
the
doones
moreover
that
if
he
did
get
one
his
own
wig
would
be
singed
with
it
but
for
divers
reasons
i
held
my
peace
partly
from
youth
and
modesty
partly
from
desire
to
see
whatever
please
god
i
should
see
and
partly
from
other
causes
we
rode
by
way
of
brendon
town
illford
bridge
and
babbrook
to
avoid
the
great
hill
above
lynmouth
and
the
day
being
fine
and
clear
again
i
laughed
in
my
sleeve
at
uncle
reuben
for
all
his
fine
precautions
when
we
arrived
at
ley
manor
we
were
shown
very
civilly
into
the
hall
and
refreshed
with
good
ale
and
collared
head
and
the
back
of
a
christmas
pudding
i
had
never
been
under
so
fine
a
roof
unless
it
were
of
a
church
before
and
it
pleased
me
greatly
to
be
so
kindly
entreated
by
highborn
folk
but
uncle
reuben
was
vexed
a
little
at
being
set
down
side
by
side
with
a
man
in
a
very
small
way
of
trade
who
was
come
upon
some
business
there
and
who
made
bold
to
drink
his
health
after
finishing
their
horns
of
ale
sir
said
uncle
ben
looking
at
him
my
health
would
fare
much
better
if
you
would
pay
me
three
pounds
and
twelve
shillings
which
you
have
owed
me
these
five
years
back
and
now
we
are
met
at
the
justices
the
opportunity
is
good
sir
after
that
we
were
called
to
the
justiceroom
where
the
baron
himself
was
sitting
with
colonel
harding
another
justiciary
of
the
kings
peace
to
help
him
i
had
seen
the
baron
de
whichehalse
before
and
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
him
having
been
at
school
with
his
son
as
he
knew
and
it
made
him
very
kind
to
me
and
indeed
he
was
kind
to
everybody
and
all
our
people
spoke
well
of
him
and
so
much
the
more
because
we
knew
that
the
house
was
in
decadence
for
the
first
de
whichehalse
had
come
from
holland
where
he
had
been
a
great
nobleman
some
hundred
and
fifty
years
agone
being
persecuted
for
his
religion
when
the
spanish
power
was
everything
he
fled
to
england
with
all
he
could
save
and
bought
large
estates
in
devonshire
since
then
his
descendants
had
intermarried
with
ancient
county
families
cottwells
and
marwoods
and
walronds
and
welses
of
pylton
and
chichesters
of
hall
and
several
of
the
ladies
brought
them
large
increase
of
property
and
so
about
fifty
years
before
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
there
were
few
names
in
the
west
of
england
thought
more
of
than
de
whichehalse
but
now
they
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
land
and
therefore
of
that
which
goes
with
land
as
surely
as
fame
belongs
to
earthi
mean
big
reputation
how
they
had
lost
it
none
could
tell
except
that
as
the
first
descendants
had
a
manner
of
amassing
so
the
later
ones
were
gifted
with
a
power
of
scattering
whether
this
came
of
good
devonshire
blood
opening
the
sluice
of
low
country
veins
is
beyond
both
my
province
and
my
power
to
inquire
anyhow
all
people
loved
this
last
strain
of
de
whichehalse
far
more
than
the
name
had
been
liked
a
hundred
years
agone
hugh
de
whichehalse
a
whitehaired
man
of
very
noble
presence
with
friendly
blue
eyes
and
a
sweet
smooth
forehead
and
aquiline
nose
quite
beautiful
as
you
might
expect
in
a
lady
of
birth
and
thin
lips
curving
delicately
this
gentleman
rose
as
we
entered
the
room
while
colonel
harding
turned
on
his
chair
and
struck
one
spur
against
the
other
i
am
sure
that
without
knowing
aught
of
either
we
must
have
reverenced
more
of
the
two
the
one
who
showed
respect
to
us
and
yet
nine
gentleman
out
of
ten
make
this
dull
mistake
when
dealing
with
the
class
below
them
uncle
reuben
made
his
very
best
scrape
and
then
walked
up
to
the
table
trying
to
look
as
if
he
did
not
know
himself
to
be
wealthier
than
both
the
gentlemen
put
together
of
course
he
was
no
stranger
to
them
any
more
than
i
was
and
as
it
proved
afterwards
colonel
harding
owed
him
a
lump
of
money
upon
very
good
security
of
him
uncle
reuben
took
no
notice
but
addressed
himself
to
de
whichehalse
the
baron
smiled
very
gently
so
soon
as
he
learned
the
cause
of
this
visit
and
then
he
replied
quite
reasonably
a
warrant
against
the
doones
master
huckaback
which
of
the
doones
so
please
you
and
the
christian
names
what
be
they
my
lord
i
am
not
their
godfather
and
most
like
they
never
had
any
but
we
all
know
old
sir
ensors
name
so
that
may
be
no
obstacle
sir
ensor
doone
and
his
sonsso
be
it
how
many
sons
master
huckaback
and
what
is
the
name
of
each
one
how
can
i
tell
you
my
lord
even
if
i
had
known
them
all
as
well
as
my
own
shopboys
nevertheless
there
were
seven
of
them
and
that
should
be
no
obstacle
a
warrant
against
sir
ensor
doone
and
seven
sons
of
sir
ensor
doone
christian
names
unknown
and
doubted
if
they
have
any
so
far
so
good
master
huckaback
i
have
it
all
down
in
writing
sir
ensor
himself
was
there
of
course
as
you
have
given
in
evidence
no
no
my
lord
i
never
said
that
i
never
said
if
he
can
prove
that
he
was
not
there
you
may
be
indicted
for
perjury
but
as
for
those
seven
sons
of
his
of
course
you
can
swear
that
they
were
his
sons
and
not
his
nephews
or
grandchildren
or
even
no
doones
at
all
my
lord
i
can
swear
that
they
were
doones
moreover
i
can
pay
for
any
mistake
i
make
therein
need
be
no
obstacle
oh
yes
he
can
pay
he
can
pay
well
enough
said
colonel
harding
shortly
i
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
it
replied
the
baron
pleasantly
for
it
proves
after
all
that
this
robbery
if
robbery
there
has
been
was
not
so
very
ruinous
sometimes
people
think
they
are
robbed
and
then
it
is
very
sweet
afterwards
to
find
that
they
have
not
been
so
for
it
adds
to
their
joy
in
their
property
now
are
you
quite
convinced
good
sir
that
these
people
if
there
were
any
stole
or
took
or
even
borrowed
anything
at
all
from
you
my
lord
do
you
think
that
i
was
drunk
not
for
a
moment
master
huckaback
although
excuse
might
be
made
for
you
at
this
time
of
the
year
but
how
did
you
know
that
your
visitors
were
of
this
particular
family
because
it
could
be
nobody
else
because
in
spite
of
the
fog
fog
cried
colonel
harding
sharply
fog
said
the
baron
with
emphasis
ah
that
explains
the
whole
affair
to
be
sure
now
i
remember
the
weather
has
been
too
thick
for
a
man
to
see
the
head
of
his
own
horse
the
doones
if
still
there
be
any
doones
could
never
have
come
abroad
that
is
as
sure
as
simony
master
huckaback
for
your
good
sake
i
am
heartily
glad
that
this
charge
has
miscarried
i
thoroughly
understand
it
now
the
fog
explains
the
whole
of
it
go
back
my
good
fellow
said
colonel
harding
and
if
the
day
is
clear
enough
you
will
find
all
your
things
where
you
left
them
i
know
from
my
own
experience
what
it
is
to
be
caught
in
an
exmoor
fog
uncle
reuben
by
this
time
was
so
put
out
that
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
my
lord
sir
colonel
is
this
your
justice
if
i
go
to
london
myself
for
it
the
king
shall
know
how
his
commissionhow
a
man
may
be
robbed
and
the
justices
prove
that
he
ought
to
be
hanged
at
back
of
it
that
in
his
good
shire
of
somerset
your
pardon
a
moment
good
sir
de
whichehalse
interrupted
him
but
i
was
about
having
heard
your
case
to
mention
what
need
be
an
obstacle
and
i
fear
would
prove
a
fatal
one
even
if
satisfactory
proof
were
afforded
of
a
felony
the
malfeasance
if
any
was
laid
in
somerset
but
we
two
humble
servants
of
his
majesty
are
in
commission
of
his
peace
for
the
county
of
devon
only
and
therefore
could
never
deal
with
it
and
why
in
the
name
of
god
cried
uncle
reuben
now
carried
at
last
fairly
beyond
himself
why
could
you
not
say
as
much
at
first
and
save
me
all
this
waste
of
time
and
worry
of
my
temper
gentlemen
you
are
all
in
league
all
of
you
stick
together
you
think
it
fair
sport
for
an
honest
trader
who
makes
no
shams
as
you
do
to
be
robbed
and
wellnigh
murdered
so
long
as
they
who
did
it
won
the
high
birthright
of
felony
if
a
poor
sheep
stealer
to
save
his
children
from
dying
of
starvation
had
dared
to
look
at
a
twomonth
lamb
he
would
swing
on
the
manor
gallows
and
all
of
you
cry
good
riddance
but
now
because
good
birth
and
bad
manners
here
poor
uncle
ben
not
being
so
strong
as
before
the
doones
had
played
with
him
began
to
foam
at
the
mouth
a
little
and
his
tongue
went
into
the
hollow
where
his
short
grey
whiskers
were
i
forget
how
we
came
out
of
it
only
i
was
greatly
shocked
at
bearding
of
the
gentry
so
and
mother
scarce
could
see
her
way
when
i
told
her
all
about
it
depend
upon
it
you
were
wrong
john
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
her
though
what
had
i
done
but
listen
and
touch
my
forelock
when
called
upon
john
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
you
have
not
done
as
you
should
have
done
your
father
would
have
been
shocked
to
think
of
going
to
baron
de
whichehalse
and
in
his
own
house
insulting
him
and
yet
it
was
very
brave
of
you
john
just
like
you
all
over
and
as
none
of
the
men
are
here
dear
john
i
am
proud
of
you
for
doing
it
all
throughout
the
homeward
road
uncle
ben
had
been
very
silent
feeling
much
displeased
with
himself
and
still
more
so
with
other
people
but
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
just
said
to
me
nephew
jack
you
have
not
behaved
so
badly
as
the
rest
to
me
and
because
you
have
no
gift
of
talking
i
think
that
i
may
trust
you
now
mark
my
words
this
villain
job
shall
not
have
ending
here
i
have
another
card
to
play
you
mean
sir
i
suppose
that
you
will
go
to
the
justices
of
this
shire
squire
maunder
or
sir
richard
blewitt
or
oaf
i
mean
nothing
of
the
sort
they
would
only
make
a
laughingstock
as
those
devonshire
people
did
of
me
no
i
will
go
to
the
king
himself
or
a
man
who
is
bigger
than
the
king
and
to
whom
i
have
ready
access
i
will
not
tell
thee
his
name
at
present
only
if
thou
art
brought
before
him
never
wilt
thou
forget
it
that
was
true
enough
by
the
bye
as
i
discovered
afterwards
for
the
man
he
meant
was
judge
jeffreys
and
when
are
you
likely
to
see
him
sir
maybe
in
the
spring
maybe
not
until
summer
for
i
cannot
go
to
london
on
purpose
but
when
my
business
takes
me
there
only
remember
my
words
jack
and
when
you
see
the
man
i
mean
look
straight
at
him
and
tell
no
lie
he
will
make
some
of
your
zany
squires
shake
in
their
shoes
i
reckon
now
i
have
been
in
this
lonely
hole
far
longer
than
i
intended
by
reason
of
this
outrage
yet
i
will
stay
here
one
day
more
upon
a
certain
condition
upon
what
condition
uncle
ben
i
grieve
that
you
find
it
so
lonely
we
will
have
farmer
nicholas
up
again
and
the
singers
and
the
fashionable
milkmaids
i
thank
you
let
me
be
the
wenches
are
too
loud
for
me
your
nanny
is
enough
nanny
is
a
good
child
and
she
shall
come
and
visit
me
uncle
reuben
would
always
call
her
nanny
he
said
that
annie
was
too
fine
and
frenchified
for
us
but
my
condition
is
this
jackthat
you
shall
guide
me
tomorrow
without
a
word
to
any
one
to
a
place
where
i
may
well
descry
the
dwelling
of
these
scoundrel
doones
and
learn
the
best
way
to
get
at
them
when
the
time
shall
come
can
you
do
this
for
me
i
will
pay
you
well
boy
i
promised
very
readily
to
do
my
best
to
serve
him
but
of
course
would
take
no
money
for
it
not
being
so
poor
as
that
came
to
accordingly
on
the
day
following
i
managed
to
set
the
men
at
work
on
the
other
side
of
the
farm
especially
that
inquisitive
and
busybody
john
fry
who
would
pry
out
almost
anything
for
the
pleasure
of
telling
his
wife
and
then
with
uncle
reuben
mounted
on
my
ancient
peggy
i
made
foot
for
the
westward
directly
after
breakfast
uncle
ben
refused
to
go
unless
i
would
take
a
loaded
gun
and
indeed
it
was
always
wise
to
do
so
in
those
days
of
turbulence
and
none
the
less
because
of
late
more
than
usual
of
our
sheep
had
left
their
skins
behind
them
this
as
i
need
hardly
say
was
not
to
be
charged
to
the
appetite
of
the
doones
for
they
always
said
that
they
were
not
butchers
although
upon
that
subject
might
well
be
two
opinions
and
their
practice
was
to
make
the
shepherds
kill
and
skin
and
quarter
for
them
and
sometimes
carry
to
the
doonegate
the
prime
among
the
fatlings
for
fear
of
any
bruising
which
spoils
the
look
at
table
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
ignorant
folk
unaware
of
their
fastidiousness
scored
to
them
the
sheep
they
lost
by
lowerborn
marauders
and
so
were
afraid
to
speak
of
it
and
the
issue
of
this
error
was
that
a
farmer
with
five
or
six
hundred
sheep
could
never
command
on
his
weddingday
a
prime
saddle
of
mutton
for
dinner
to
return
now
to
my
uncle
benand
indeed
he
would
not
let
me
go
more
than
three
landyards
from
himthere
was
very
little
said
between
us
along
the
lane
and
across
the
hill
although
the
day
was
pleasant
i
could
see
that
he
was
half
amiss
with
his
mind
about
the
business
and
not
so
full
of
security
as
an
elderly
man
should
keep
himself
therefore
out
i
spake
and
said
uncle
reuben
have
no
fear
i
know
every
inch
of
the
ground
sir
and
there
is
no
danger
nigh
us
fear
boy
who
ever
thought
of
fear
tis
the
last
thing
would
come
across
me
pretty
things
those
primroses
at
once
i
thought
of
lorna
doone
the
little
maid
of
six
years
back
and
how
my
fancy
went
with
her
could
lorna
ever
think
of
me
was
i
not
a
lout
gone
by
only
fit
for
loachsticking
had
i
ever
seen
a
face
fit
to
think
of
near
her
the
sudden
flash
the
quickness
the
bright
desire
to
know
ones
heart
and
not
withhold
her
own
from
it
the
soft
withdrawal
of
rich
eyes
the
longing
to
love
somebody
anybody
anything
not
imbrued
with
wickedness
my
uncle
interrupted
me
misliking
so
much
silence
now
with
the
naked
woods
falling
over
us
for
we
were
come
to
bagworthy
forest
the
blackest
and
the
loneliest
place
of
all
that
keep
the
sun
out
even
now
in
wintertime
with
most
of
the
wood
unriddled
and
the
rest
of
it
pinched
brown
it
hung
around
us
like
a
cloak
containing
little
comfort
i
kept
quite
close
to
peggys
head
and
peggy
kept
quite
close
to
me
and
pricked
her
ears
at
everything
however
we
saw
nothing
there
except
a
few
old
owls
and
hawks
and
a
magpie
sitting
all
alone
until
we
came
to
the
bank
of
the
hill
where
the
pony
could
not
climb
it
uncle
ben
was
very
loath
to
get
off
because
the
pony
seemed
company
and
he
thought
he
could
gallop
away
on
her
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
but
i
persuaded
him
that
now
he
must
go
to
the
end
of
it
therefore
he
made
peggy
fast
in
a
place
where
we
could
find
her
and
speaking
cheerfully
as
if
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
he
took
his
staff
and
i
my
gun
to
climb
the
thick
ascent
there
was
now
no
path
of
any
kind
which
added
to
our
courage
all
it
lessened
of
our
comfort
because
it
proved
that
the
robbers
were
not
in
the
habit
of
passing
there
and
we
knew
that
we
could
not
go
astray
so
long
as
we
breasted
the
hill
before
us
inasmuch
as
it
formed
the
rampart
or
sidefence
of
glen
doone
but
in
truth
i
used
the
right
word
there
for
the
manner
of
our
ascent
for
the
ground
came
forth
so
steep
against
us
and
withal
so
woody
that
to
make
any
way
we
must
throw
ourselves
forward
and
labour
as
at
a
breastplough
rough
and
loamy
rungs
of
oakroot
bulged
here
and
there
above
our
heads
briers
needs
must
speak
with
us
using
more
of
tooth
than
tongue
and
sometimes
bulks
of
rugged
stone
like
great
sheep
stood
across
us
at
last
though
very
loath
to
do
it
i
was
forced
to
leave
my
gun
behind
because
i
required
one
hand
to
drag
myself
up
the
difficulty
and
one
to
help
uncle
reuben
and
so
at
last
we
gained
the
top
and
looked
forth
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
the
ground
was
very
stony
and
like
the
crest
of
a
quarry
and
no
more
trees
between
us
and
the
brink
of
cliff
below
three
hundred
yards
below
it
might
be
all
strong
slope
and
gliddery
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
was
amazed
at
the
appearance
of
the
dooness
stronghold
and
understood
its
nature
for
when
i
had
been
even
in
the
valley
and
climbed
the
cliffs
to
escape
from
it
about
seven
years
agone
i
was
no
more
than
a
stripling
boy
noting
little
as
boys
do
except
for
their
present
purpose
and
even
that
soon
done
with
but
now
what
with
the
fame
of
the
doones
and
my
own
recollections
and
uncle
bens
insistence
all
my
attention
was
called
forth
and
the
end
was
simple
astonishment
the
chine
of
highland
whereon
we
stood
curved
to
the
right
and
left
of
us
keeping
about
the
same
elevation
and
crowned
with
trees
and
brushwood
at
about
half
a
mile
in
front
of
us
but
looking
as
if
we
could
throw
a
stone
to
strike
any
man
upon
it
another
crest
just
like
our
own
bowed
around
to
meet
it
but
failed
by
reason
of
two
narrow
clefts
of
which
we
could
only
see
the
brink
one
of
these
clefts
was
the
doonegate
with
a
portcullis
of
rock
above
it
and
the
other
was
the
chasm
by
which
i
had
once
made
entrance
betwixt
them
where
the
hills
fell
back
as
in
a
perfect
oval
traversed
by
the
winding
water
lay
a
bright
green
valley
rimmed
with
sheer
black
rock
and
seeming
to
have
sunken
bodily
from
the
bleak
rough
heights
above
it
looked
as
if
no
frost
could
enter
neither
wind
go
ruffling
only
spring
and
hope
and
comfort
breathe
to
one
another
even
now
the
rays
of
sunshine
dwelt
and
fell
back
on
one
another
whenever
the
clouds
lifted
and
the
pale
blue
glimpse
of
the
growing
day
seemed
to
find
young
encouragement
but
for
all
that
uncle
reuben
was
none
the
worse
nor
better
he
looked
down
into
glen
doone
first
and
sniffed
as
if
he
were
smelling
it
like
a
sample
of
goods
from
a
wholesale
house
and
then
he
looked
at
the
hills
over
yonder
and
then
he
stared
at
me
see
what
a
pack
of
fools
they
be
of
course
i
do
uncle
ben
all
rogues
are
fools
was
my
first
copy
beginning
of
the
alphabet
pack
of
stuff
lad
though
true
enough
and
very
good
for
young
people
but
see
you
not
how
this
great
doone
valley
may
be
taken
in
half
an
hour
yes
to
be
sure
i
do
uncle
if
they
like
to
give
it
up
i
mean
three
culverins
on
yonder
hill
and
three
on
the
top
of
this
one
and
we
have
them
under
a
pestle
ah
i
have
seen
the
wars
my
lad
from
keinton
up
to
naseby
and
i
might
have
been
a
general
now
if
they
had
taken
my
advice
but
i
was
not
attending
to
him
being
drawn
away
on
a
sudden
by
a
sight
which
never
struck
the
sharp
eyes
of
our
general
for
i
had
long
ago
descried
that
little
opening
in
the
cliff
through
which
i
made
my
exit
as
before
related
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
no
bigger
than
a
rabbithole
it
seemed
from
where
we
stood
and
yet
of
all
the
scene
before
me
that
from
my
remembrance
perhaps
had
the
most
attraction
now
gazing
at
it
with
full
thought
of
all
that
it
had
cost
me
i
saw
a
little
figure
come
and
pause
and
pass
into
it
something
very
light
and
white
nimble
smooth
and
elegant
gone
almost
before
i
knew
that
any
one
had
been
there
and
yet
my
heart
came
to
my
ribs
and
all
my
blood
was
in
my
face
and
pride
within
me
fought
with
shame
and
vanity
with
selfcontempt
for
though
seven
years
were
gone
and
i
from
my
boyhood
come
to
manhood
and
all
must
have
forgotten
me
and
i
had
halfforgotten
at
that
moment
once
for
all
i
felt
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
fate
however
poor
it
might
be
weal
or
woe
in
lorna

chapter
xvi
lorna
growing
formidable
having
reconnoitred
thus
the
position
of
the
enemy
master
huckaback
on
the
homeward
road
crossexamined
me
in
a
manner
not
at
all
desirable
for
he
had
noted
my
confusion
and
eager
gaze
at
something
unseen
by
him
in
the
valley
and
thereupon
he
made
up
his
mind
to
know
everything
about
it
in
this
however
he
partly
failed
for
although
i
was
no
hand
at
fence
and
would
not
tell
him
a
falsehood
i
managed
so
to
hold
my
peace
that
he
put
himself
upon
the
wrong
track
and
continued
thereon
with
many
vaunts
of
his
shrewdness
and
experience
and
some
chuckles
at
my
simplicity
thus
much
however
he
learned
aright
that
i
had
been
in
the
doone
valley
several
years
before
and
might
be
brought
upon
strong
inducement
to
venture
there
again
but
as
to
the
mode
of
my
getting
in
the
things
i
saw
and
my
thoughts
upon
them
he
not
only
failed
to
learn
the
truth
but
certified
himself
into
an
obstinacy
of
error
from
which
no
afterknowledge
was
able
to
deliver
him
and
this
he
did
not
only
because
i
happened
to
say
very
little
but
forasmuch
as
he
disbelieved
half
of
the
truth
i
told
him
through
his
own
too
great
sagacity
upon
one
point
however
he
succeeded
more
easily
than
he
expected
viz
in
making
me
promise
to
visit
the
place
again
as
soon
as
occasion
offered
and
to
hold
my
own
counsel
about
it
but
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
one
thing
that
according
to
his
point
of
view
my
own
counsel
meant
my
own
and
master
reuben
huckabacks
now
he
being
gone
as
he
went
next
day
to
his
favourite
town
of
dulverton
and
leaving
behind
him
shadowy
promise
of
the
mountains
he
would
do
for
me
my
spirit
began
to
burn
and
pant
for
something
to
go
on
with
and
nothing
showed
a
braver
hope
of
movement
and
adventure
than
a
lonely
visit
to
glen
doone
by
way
of
the
perilous
passage
discovered
in
my
boyhood
therefore
i
waited
for
nothing
more
than
the
slow
arrival
of
new
smallclothes
made
by
a
good
tailor
at
porlock
for
i
was
wishful
to
look
my
best
and
when
they
were
come
and
approved
i
started
regardless
of
the
expense
and
forgetting
like
a
fool
how
badly
they
would
take
the
water
what
with
urging
of
the
tailor
and
my
own
misgivings
the
time
was
now
come
round
again
to
the
highday
of
st
valentine
when
all
our
maids
were
full
of
lovers
and
all
the
lads
looked
foolish
and
none
of
them
more
sheepish
or
innocent
than
i
myself
albeit
twentyone
years
old
and
not
afraid
of
men
much
but
terrified
of
women
at
least
if
they
were
comely
and
what
of
all
things
scared
me
most
was
the
thought
of
my
own
size
and
knowledge
of
my
strength
which
came
like
knots
upon
me
daily
in
honest
truth
i
tell
this
thing
which
often
since
hath
puzzled
me
when
i
came
to
mix
with
men
more
i
was
to
that
degree
ashamed
of
my
thickness
and
my
stature
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
that
i
would
not
put
a
trunk
of
wood
on
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
but
let
annie
scold
me
well
with
a
smile
to
follow
and
with
her
own
plump
hands
lift
up
a
little
log
and
fuel
it
many
a
time
i
longed
to
be
no
bigger
than
john
fry
was
whom
now
when
insolent
i
took
with
my
left
hand
by
the
waiststuff
and
set
him
on
my
hat
and
gave
him
little
chance
to
tread
it
until
he
spoke
of
his
family
and
requested
to
come
down
again
now
taking
for
good
omen
this
that
i
was
a
sevenyear
valentine
though
much
too
big
for
a
cupidon
i
chose
a
sevenfoot
staff
of
ash
and
fixed
a
loachfork
in
it
to
look
as
i
had
looked
before
and
leaving
word
upon
matters
of
business
out
of
the
back
door
i
went
and
so
through
the
little
orchard
and
down
the
brawling
lynnbrook
not
being
now
so
much
afraid
i
struck
across
the
thicket
land
between
the
meeting
waters
and
came
upon
the
bagworthy
stream
near
the
great
black
whirlpool
nothing
amazed
me
so
much
as
to
find
how
shallow
the
stream
now
looked
to
me
although
the
pool
was
still
as
black
and
greedy
as
it
used
to
be
and
still
the
great
rocky
slide
was
dark
and
difficult
to
climb
though
the
water
which
once
had
taken
my
knees
was
satisfied
now
with
my
ankles
after
some
labour
i
reached
the
top
and
halted
to
look
about
me
well
before
trusting
to
broad
daylight
the
winter
as
i
said
before
had
been
a
very
mild
one
and
now
the
spring
was
toward
so
that
bank
and
bush
were
touched
with
it
the
valley
into
which
i
gazed
was
fair
with
early
promise
having
shelter
from
the
wind
and
taking
all
the
sunshine
the
willowbushes
over
the
stream
hung
as
if
they
were
angling
with
tasseled
floats
of
gold
and
silver
bursting
like
a
beanpod
between
them
came
the
water
laughing
like
a
maid
at
her
own
dancing
and
spread
with
that
young
blue
which
never
lives
beyond
the
april
and
on
either
bank
the
meadow
ruffled
as
the
breeze
came
by
opening
through
new
tuft
of
green
daisybud
or
celandine
or
a
shy
glimpse
now
and
then
of
the
lovelorn
primrose
though
i
am
so
blank
of
wit
or
perhaps
for
that
same
reason
these
little
things
come
and
dwell
with
me
and
i
am
happy
about
them
and
long
for
nothing
better
i
feel
with
every
blade
of
grass
as
if
it
had
a
history
and
make
a
child
of
every
bud
as
though
it
knew
and
loved
me
and
being
so
they
seem
to
tell
me
of
my
own
delusions
how
i
am
no
more
than
they
except
in
selfimportance
while
i
was
forgetting
much
of
many
things
that
harm
one
and
letting
of
my
thoughts
go
wild
to
sounds
and
sights
of
nature
a
sweeter
note
than
thrush
or
ouzel
ever
wooed
a
mate
in
floated
on
the
valley
breeze
at
the
quiet
turn
of
sundown
the
words
were
of
an
ancient
song
fit
to
laugh
or
cry
at
love
an
if
there
be
one
come
my
love
to
be
my
love
is
for
the
one
loving
unto
me
not
for
me
the
show
love
of
a
gilded
bliss
only
thou
must
know
love
what
my
value
is
if
in
all
the
earth
love
thou
hast
none
but
me
this
shall
be
my
worth
love
to
be
cheap
to
thee
but
if
so
thou
ever
strivest
to
be
free
twill
be
my
endeavour
to
be
dear
to
thee
so
shall
i
have
plea
love
is
thy
heart
andbreath
clinging
still
to
thee
love
in
the
doom
of
death
all
this
i
took
in
with
great
eagerness
not
for
the
sake
of
the
meaning
which
is
no
doubt
an
allegory
but
for
the
power
and
richness
and
softness
of
the
singing
which
seemed
to
me
better
than
we
ever
had
even
in
oare
church
but
all
the
time
i
kept
myself
in
a
black
niche
of
the
rock
where
the
fall
of
the
water
began
lest
the
sweet
singer
espying
me
should
be
alarmed
and
flee
away
but
presently
i
ventured
to
look
forth
where
a
bush
was
and
then
i
beheld
the
loveliest
sightone
glimpse
of
which
was
enough
to
make
me
kneel
in
the
coldest
water
by
the
side
of
the
stream
she
was
coming
to
me
even
among
the
primroses
as
if
she
loved
them
all
and
every
flower
looked
the
brighter
as
her
eyes
were
on
them
i
could
not
see
what
her
face
was
my
heart
so
awoke
and
trembled
only
that
her
hair
was
flowing
from
a
wreath
of
white
violets
and
the
grace
of
her
coming
was
like
the
appearance
of
the
first
windflower
the
pale
gleam
over
the
western
cliffs
threw
a
shadow
of
light
behind
her
as
if
the
sun
were
lingering
never
do
i
see
that
light
from
the
closing
of
the
west
even
in
these
my
aged
days
without
thinking
of
her
ah
me
if
it
comes
to
that
what
do
i
see
of
earth
or
heaven
without
thinking
of
her
the
tremulous
thrill
of
her
song
was
hanging
on
her
open
lips
and
she
glanced
around
as
if
the
birds
were
accustomed
to
make
answer
to
me
it
was
a
thing
of
terror
to
behold
such
beauty
and
feel
myself
the
while
to
be
so
very
low
and
common
but
scarcely
knowing
what
i
did
as
if
a
rope
were
drawing
me
i
came
from
the
dark
mouth
of
the
chasm
and
stood
afraid
to
look
at
her
she
was
turning
to
fly
not
knowing
me
and
frightened
perhaps
at
my
stature
when
i
fell
on
the
grass
as
i
fell
before
her
seven
years
agone
that
day
and
i
just
said
lorna
doone
she
knew
me
at
once
from
my
manner
and
ways
and
a
smile
broke
through
her
trembling
as
sunshine
comes
through
aspenleaves
and
being
so
clever
she
saw
of
course
that
she
needed
not
to
fear
me
oh
indeed
she
cried
with
a
feint
of
anger
because
she
had
shown
her
cowardice
and
yet
in
her
heart
she
was
laughing
oh
if
you
please
who
are
you
sir
and
how
do
you
know
my
name
i
am
john
ridd
i
answered
the
boy
who
gave
you
those
beautiful
fish
when
you
were
only
a
little
thing
seven
years
ago
today
yes
the
poor
boy
who
was
frightened
so
and
obliged
to
hide
here
in
the
water
and
do
you
remember
how
kind
you
were
and
saved
my
life
by
your
quickness
and
went
away
riding
upon
a
great
mans
shoulder
as
if
you
had
never
seen
me
and
yet
looked
back
through
the
willowtrees
oh
yes
i
remember
everything
because
it
was
so
rare
to
see
any
excepti
mean
because
i
happen
to
remember
but
you
seem
not
to
remember
sir
how
perilous
this
place
is
for
she
had
kept
her
eyes
upon
me
large
eyes
of
a
softness
a
brightness
and
a
dignity
which
made
me
feel
as
if
i
must
for
ever
love
and
yet
for
ever
know
myself
unworthy
unless
themselves
should
fill
with
love
which
is
the
spring
of
all
things
and
so
i
could
not
answer
her
but
was
overcome
with
thinking
and
feeling
and
confusion
neither
could
i
look
again
only
waited
for
the
melody
which
made
every
word
like
a
poem
to
me
the
melody
of
her
voice
but
she
had
not
the
least
idea
of
what
was
going
on
with
me
any
more
than
i
myself
had
i
think
master
ridd
you
cannot
know
she
said
with
her
eyes
taken
from
me
what
the
dangers
of
this
place
are
and
the
nature
of
the
people
yes
i
know
enough
of
that
and
i
am
frightened
greatly
all
the
time
when
i
do
not
look
at
you
she
was
too
young
to
answer
me
in
the
style
some
maidens
would
have
used
the
manner
i
mean
which
now
we
call
from
a
foreign
word
coquettish
and
more
than
that
she
was
trembling
from
real
fear
of
violence
lest
strong
hands
might
be
laid
on
me
and
a
miserable
end
of
it
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
grew
afraid
perhaps
from
a
kind
of
sympathy
and
because
i
knew
that
evil
comes
more
readily
than
good
to
us
therefore
without
more
ado
or
taking
any
advantagealthough
i
would
have
been
glad
at
heart
if
needs
had
been
to
kiss
her
without
any
thought
of
rudenessit
struck
me
that
i
had
better
go
and
have
no
more
to
say
to
her
until
next
time
of
coming
so
would
she
look
the
more
for
me
and
think
the
more
about
me
and
not
grow
weary
of
my
words
and
the
want
of
change
there
is
in
me
for
of
course
i
knew
what
a
churl
i
was
compared
to
her
birth
and
appearance
but
meanwhile
i
might
improve
myself
and
learn
a
musical
instrument
the
wind
hath
a
draw
after
flying
straw
is
a
saying
we
have
in
devonshire
made

by
somebody
who
had
seen
the
ways
of
women
mistress
lorna
i
will
departmark
you
i
thought
that
a
powerful
wordin
fear
of
causing
disquiet
if
any
rogue
shot
me
it
would
grieve
you
i
make
bold
to
say
it
and
it
would
be
the
death
of
mother
few
mothers
have
such
a
son
as
me
try
to
think
of
me
now
and
then
and
i
will
bring
you
some
newlaid
eggs
for
our
young
blue
hen

i
thank
you
heartily
said
lorna
but
you
need
not
come
to
see
me
you
can
put
them
in
my
little
bower
where
i
am
almost
alwaysi
mean
whither
daily
i
repair
to
read
and
to
be
away
from
them
only
show
me
where
it
is
thrice
a
day
i
will
come
and
stop
nay
master
ridd
i
would
never
show
theenever
because
of
perilonly
that
so
happens
it
thou
hast
found
the
way
already
and
she
smiled
with
a
light
that
made
me
care
to
cry
out
for
no
other
way
except
to
her
dear
heart
but
only
to
myself
i
cried
for
anything
at
all
having
enough
of
man
in
me
to
be
bashful
with
young
maidens
so
i
touched
her
white
hand
softly
when
she
gave
it
to
me
and
fancying
that
she
had
sighed
was
touched
at
heart
about
it
and
resolved
to
yield
her
all
my
goods
although
my
mother
was
living
and
then
grew
angry
with
myself
for
a
mile
or
more
of
walking
to
think
she
would
condescend
so
and
then
for
the
rest
of
the
homeward
road
was
mad
with
every
man
in
the
world
who
would
dare
to
think
of
having
her
chapter

john
is
clearly
bewitched
to
forget
ones
luck
of
life
to
forget
the
cark
of
care
and
withering
of
young
fingers
not
to
feel
or
not
be
moved
by
all
the
change
of
thought
and
heart
from
large
young
heat
to
the
sinewy
lines
and
dry
bones
of
old
agethis
is
what
i
have
to
do
ere
ever
i
can
make
you
know
even
as
a
dream
is
known
how
i
loved
my
lorna
i
myself
can
never
know
never
can
conceive
or
treat
it
as
a
thing
of
reason
never
can
behold
myself
dwelling
in
the
midst
of
it
and
think
that
this
was
i
neither
can
i
wander
far
from
perpetual
thought
of
it
perhaps
i
have
two
farrows
of
pigs
ready
for
the
chapman
perhaps
i
have
ten
stones
of
wool
waiting
for
the
factor
it
is
all
the
same
i
look
at
both
and
what
i
say
to
myself
is
this
which
would
lorna
choose
of
them
of
course
i
am
a
fool
for
this
any
man
may
call
me
so
and
i
will
not
quarrel
with
him
unless
he
guess
my
secret
of
course
i
fetch
my
wit
if
it
be
worth
the
fetching
back
again
to
business
but
there
my
heart
is
and
must
be
and
all
who
like
to
try
can
cheat
me
except
upon
parish
matters
that
week
i
could
do
little
more
than
dream
and
dream
and
rove
about
seeking
by
perpetual
change
to
find
the
way
back
to
myself
i
cared
not
for
the
people
round
me
neither
took
delight
in
victuals
but
made
believe
to
eat
and
drink
and
blushed
at
any
questions
and
being
called
the
master
now
headfarmer
and
chief
yeoman
it
irked
me
much
that
any
one
should
take
advantage
of
me
yet
everybody
did
so
as
soon
as
ever
it
was
known
that
my
wits
were
gone
moonraking
for
that
was
the
way
they
looked
at
it
not
being
able
to
comprehend
the
greatness
and
the
loftiness
neither
do
i
blame
them
much
for
the
wisest
thing
is
to
laugh
at
people
when
we
cannot
understand
them
i
for
my
part
took
no
notice
but
in
my
heart
despised
them
as
beings
of
a
lesser
nature
who
never
had
seen
lorna
yet
i
was
vexed
and
rubbed
myself
when
john
fry
spread
all
over
the
farm
and
even
at
the
shoeing
forge
that
a
mad
dog
had
come
and
bitten
me
from
the
other
side
of
mallond
this
seems
little
to
me
now
and
so
it
might
to
any
one
but
at
the
time
it
worked
me
up
to
a
fever
of
indignity
to
make
a
mad
dog
of
lorna
to
compare
all
my
imaginings
which
were
strange
i
do
assure
youthe
faculty
not
being
apt
to
work
to
count
the
raising
of
my
soul
no
more
than
hydrophobia
all
this
acted
on
me
so
that
i
gave
john
fry
the
soundest
threshing
that

both
of

by

of

and
the
need
of
looking
after
things
lest
we
should
be
like
the
southerns
for
whom
the

does
everything

knowing

mood
are
wholesome
the
spring
being
now
too
forward
a
check
to
it
was
needful
and
in
the
early
part
of
march
there
came
a
change
of
weather
all
the
young
growth
was
arrested
by
a
dry
wind
from
the
east
which
made
both
face
and
fingers
burn
when
a
man
was
doing
ditching
the
lilacs
and
the
woodbines
just
crowding
forth
in
little
tufts
close
kernelling
their
blossom
were
ruffled
back
like
a
sleeve
turned
up
and
nicked
with
brown
at
the
corners
in
the
hedges
any
man
unless
his
eyes
were
very
dull
could
see
the
mischief
doing
the
russet
of
the
young
elmbloom
was
fain
to
be
in
its
scale
again
but
having
pushed
forth
there
must
be
and
turn
to
a
tawny
colour
the
hangers
of
the
hazel
too
having
shed
their
dust
to
make
the
nuts
did
not
spread
their
little
combs
and
dry
them
as
they
ought
to
do
but
shrivelled
at
the
base
and
fell
as
if
a
knife
had
cut
them
and
more
than
all
to
notice
was
at
least
about
the
hedges
the
shuddering
of
everything
and
the
shivering
sound
among
them
toward
the
feeble
sun
such
as
we
make
to
a
poor
fireplace
when
several
doors
are
open
sometimes
i
put
my
face
to
warm
against
the
soft
rough
maplestem
which
feels
like
the
foot
of
a
red
deer
but
the
pitiless
east
wind
came
through
all
and
took
and
shook
the
caved
hedge
aback
till
its
knees
were
knocking
together
and
nothing
could
be
shelter
then
would
any
one
having
blood
and
trying
to
keep
at
home
with
it
run
to
a
sturdy
tree
and
hope
to
eat
his
food
behind
it
and
look
for
a
little
sun
to
come
and
warm
his
feet
in
the
shelter
and
if
it
did
he
might
strike
his
breast
and
try
to
think
he
was
warmer
but
when
a
man
came
home
at
night
after
long
days
labour
knowing
that
the
days
increased
and
so
his
care
should
multiply
still
he
found
enough
of
light
to
show
him
what
the
day
had
done
against
him
in
his
garden
every
ridge
of
newturned
earth
looked
like
an
old
mans
muscles
honeycombed
and
standing
out
void
of
spring
and
powdery
every
plant
that
had
rejoiced
in
passing
such
a
winter
now
was
cowering
turned
away
unfit
to
meet
the
consequence
flowing
sap
had
stopped
its
course
fluted
lines
showed
want
of
food
and
if
you
pinched
the
topmost
spray
there
was
no
rebound
or
firmness
we
think
a
good
deal
in
a
quiet
way
when
people
ask
us
about
themof
some
fine
upstanding
peartrees
grafted
by
my
grandfather
who
had
been
very
greatly
respected
and
he
got
those
grafts
by
sheltering
a
poor
italian
soldier
in
the
time
of
james
the
first
a
man
who
never
could
do
enough
to
show
his
grateful
memories
how
he
came
to
our
place
is
a
very
difficult
story
which
i
never
understood
rightly
having
heard
it
from
my
mother
at
any
rate
there
the
peartrees
were
and
there
they
are
to
this
very
day
and
i
wish
every
one
could
taste
their
fruit
old
as
they
are
and
rugged
now
these
fine
trees
had
taken
advantage
of
the
west
winds
and
the
moisture
and
the
promise
of
the
spring
time
so
as
to
fill
the
tips
of
the
spraywood
and
the
rowels
all
up
the
branches
with
a
crowd
of
eager
blossom
not
that
they
were
yet
in
bloom
nor
even
showing
whiteness
only
that
some
of
the
cones
were
opening
at
the
side
of
the
cap
which
pinched
them
and
there
you
might
count
perhaps
a
dozen
nobs
like
very
little
buttons
but
grooved
and
lined
and
huddling
close
to
make
room
for
one
another
and
among
these
buds
were
graygreen
blades
scarce
bigger
than
a
hair
almost
yet
curving
so
as
if
their
purpose
was
to
shield
the
blossom
other
of
the
spurpoints
standing
on
the
older
wood
where
the
sap
was
not
so
eager
had
not
burst
their
tunic
yet
but
were
flayed
and
flaked
with
light
casting
off
the
husk
of
brown
in
threecornered
patches
as
i
have
seen
a
scotchmans
plaid
or
as
his
legs
shows
through
it
these
buds
at
a
distance
looked
as
if
the
sky
had
been
raining
cream
upon
them
now
all
this
fair
delight
to
the
eyes
and
good
promise
to
the
palate
was
marred
and
baffled
by
the
wind
and
cutting
of
the
nightfrosts
the
opening
cones
were
struck
with
brown
in
between
the
button
buds
and
on
the
scapes
that
shielded
them
while
the
foot
part
of
the
cover
hung
like
rags
peeled
back
and
quivering
and
there
the
little
stalk
of
each
which
might
have
been
a
pear
god
willing
had
a
ring
around
its
base
and
sought
a
chance
to
drop
and
die
the
others
which
had
not
opened
comb
but
only
prepared
to
do
it
were
a
little
better
off
but
still
very
brown
and
unkid
and
shrivelling
in
doubt
of
health
and
neither
peart
nor
lusty
now
this
i
have
not
told
because
i
know
the
way
to
do
it
for
that
i
do
not
neither
yet
have
seen
a
man
who
did
know
it
is
wonderful
how
we
look
at
things
and
never
think
to
notice
them
and
i
am
as
bad
as
anybody
unless
the
thing
to
be
observed
is
a
dog
or
a
horse
or
a
maiden
and
the
last
of
those
three
i
look
at
somehow
without
knowing
that
i
take
notice
and
greatly
afraid
to
do
it
only
i
knew
afterwards
when
the
time
of
life
was
in
me
not
indeed
what
the
maiden
was
like
but
how
she
differed
from
others
yet
i
have
spoken
about
the
spring
and
the
failure
of
fair
promise
because
i
took
it
to
my
heart
as
token
of
what
would
come
to
me
in
the
budding
of
my
years
and
hope
and
even
then
being
much
possessed
and
full
of
a
foolish
melancholy
i
felt
a
sad
delight
at
being
doomed
to
blight
and
loneliness
not
but
that
i
managed
still
when
mother
was
urgent
upon
me
to
eat
my
share
of
victuals
and
cuff
a
man
for
laziness
and
see
that
a
ploughshare
made
no
leaps
and
sleep
of
a
night
without
dreaming
and
my
mother
halfbelieving
in
her
fondness
and
affection
that
what
the
parish
said
was
true
about
a
mad
dog
having
bitten
me
and
yet
arguing
that
it
must
be
false
because
god
would
have
prevented
him
my
mother
gave
me
little
rest
when
i
was
in
the
room
with
her
not
that
she
worried
me
with
questions
nor
openly
regarded
me
with
any
unusual
meaning
but
that
i
knew
she
was
watching
slyly
whenever
i
took
a
spoon
up
and
every
hour
or
so
she
managed
to
place
a
pan
of
water
by
me
quite
as
if
by
accident
and
sometimes
even
to
spill
a
little
upon
my
shoe
or
coatsleeve
but
betty
muxworthy
was
worst
for
having
no
fear
about
my
health
she
made
a
villainous
joke
of
it
and
used
to
rush
into
the
kitchen
barking
like
a
dog
and
panting
exclaiming
that
i
had
bitten
her
and
justice
she
would
have
on
me
if
it
cost
her
a
twelvemonths
wages
and
she
always
took
care
to
do
this
thing
just
when
i
had
crossed
my
legs
in
the
corner
after
supper
and
leaned
my
head
against
the
oven
to
begin
to
think
of
lorna
however
in
all
things
there
is
comfort
if
we
do
not
look
too
hard
for
it
and
now
i
had
much
satisfaction
in
my
uncouth
state
from
labouring
by
the
hour
together
at
the
hedging
and
the
ditching
meeting
the
bitter
wind
face
to
face
feeling
my
strength
increase
and
hoping
that
some
one
would
be
proud
of
it
in
the
rustling
rush
of
every
gust
in
the
graceful
bend
of
every
tree
even
in
the
lords
and
ladies
clumped
in
the
scoops
of
the
hedgerow
and
most
of
all
in
the
soft
primrose
wrung
by
the
wind
but
stealing
back
and
smiling
when
the
wrath
was
passedin
all
of
these
and
many
others
there
was
aching
ecstasy
delicious
pang
of
lorna
but
however
cold
the
weather
was
and
however
hard
the
wind
blew
one
thing
more
than
all
the
rest
worried
and
perplexed
me
this
was
that
i
could
not
settle
turn
and
twist
as
i
might
how
soon
i
ought
to
go
again
upon
a
visit
to
glen
doone
for
i
liked
not
at
all
the
falseness
of
it
albeit
against
murderers
the
creeping
out
of
sight
and
hiding
and
feeling
as
a
spy
might
and
even
more
than
this
i
feared
how
lorna
might
regard
it
whether
i
might
seem
to
her
a
prone
and
blunt
intruder
a
country
youth
not
skilled
in
manners
as
among
the
quality
even
when
they
rob
us
for
i
was
not
sure
myself
but
that
it
might
be
very
bad
manners
to
go
again
too
early
without
an
invitation
and
my
hands
and
face
were
chapped
so
badly
by
the
bitter
wind
that
lorna
might
count
them
unsightly
things
and
wish
to
see
no
more
of
them
however
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
consult
any
one
upon
this
point
at
least
in
our
own
neighbourhood
nor
even
to
speak
of
it
near
home
but
the
east
wind
holding
through
the
month
my
hands
and
face
growing
worse
and
worse
and
it
having
occurred
to
me
by
this
time
that
possibly
lorna
might
have
chaps
if
she
came
abroad
at
all
and
so
might
like
to
talk
about
them
and
show
her
little
hands
to
me
i
resolved
to
take
another
opinion
so
far
as
might
be
upon
this
matter
without
disclosing
the
circumstances
now
the
wisest
person
in
all
our
parts
was
reckoned
to
be
a
certain
wise
woman
well
known
all
over
exmoor
by
the
name
of
mother
melldrum
her
real
name
was
maple
durham
as
i
learned
long
afterwards
and
she
came
of
an
ancient
family
but
neither
of
devon
nor
somerset
nevertheless
she
was
quite
at
home
with
our
proper
modes
of
divination
and
knowing
that
we
liked
them
bestas
each
man
does
his
own
religionshe
would
always
practise
them
for
the
people
of
the
country
and
all
the
while
she
would
let
us
know
that
she
kept
a
higher
and
nobler
mode
for
those
who
looked
down
upon
this
one
not
having
been
bred
and
born
to
it
mother
melldrum
had
two
houses
or
rather
she
had
none
at
all
but
two
homes
wherein
to
find
her
according
to
the
time
of
year
in
summer
she
lived
in
a
pleasant
cave
facing
the
cool
side
of
the
hill
far
inland
near
hawkridge
and
close
above
tarrsteps
a
wonderful
crossing
of
barle
river
made
as
everybody
knows
by
satan
for
a
wager
but
throughout
the
winter
she
found
seaair
agreeable
and
a
place
where
things
could
be
had
on
credit
and
more
occasion
of
talking
not
but
what
she
could
have
credit
for
every
one
was
afraid
of
her
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tarrsteps
only
there
was
no
one
handy
owning
things
worth
taking
therefore
at
the
fall
of
the
leaf
when
the
woods
grew
damp
and
irksome
the
wise
woman
always
set
her
face
to
the
warmer
cliffs
of
the
channel
where
shelter
was
and
dry
fern
bedding
and
folk
to
be
seen
in
the
distance
from
a
bank
upon
which
the
sun
shone
and
there
as
i
knew
from
our
john
fry
who
had
been
to
her
about
rheumatism
and
sheep
possessed
with
an
evil
spirit
and
warts
on
the
hand
of
his
son
young
john
any
one
who
chose
might
find
her
towards
the
close
of
a
winter
day
gathering
sticks
and
brown
fern
for
fuel
and
talking
to
herself
the
while
in
a
hollow
stretch
behind
the
cliffs
which
foreigners
who
come
and
go
without
seeing
much
of
exmoor
have
called
the
valley
of
rocks
this
valley
or
goyal
as
we
term
it
being
small
for
a
valley
lies
to
the
west
of
linton
about
a
mile
from
the
town
perhaps
and
away
towards
ley
manor
our
homefolk
always
call
it
the
danes
or
the
denes
which
is
no
more
they
tell
me
than
a
hollow
place
even
as
the
word
den
is
however
let
that
pass
for
i
know
very
little
about
it
but
the
place
itself
is
a
pretty
one
though
nothing
to
frighten
anybody
unless
he
hath
lived
in
a
gallipot
it
is
a
green
roughsided
hollow
bending
at
the
middle
touched
with
stone
at
either
crest
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
slabs
in
and
out
the
brambles
on
the
right
hand
is
an
upward
crag
called
by
some
the
castle
easy
enough
to
scale
and
giving
great
view
of
the
channel
facing
this
from
the
inland
side
and
the
elbow
of
the
valley
a
queer
old
pile
of
rock
arises
bold
behind
one
another
and
quite
enough
to
affright
a
man
if
it
only
were
ten
times
larger
this
is
called
the
devils
cheesering
or
the
devils
cheeseknife
which
mean
the
same
thing
as
our
fathers
were
used
to
eat
their
cheese
from
a
scoop
and
perhaps
in
old
time
the
upmost
rock
which
has
fallen
away
since
i
knew
it
was
like
to
such
an
implement
if
satan
eat
cheese
untoasted
but
all
the
middle
of
this
valley
was
a
place
to
rest
in
to
sit
and
think
that
troubles
were
not
if
we
would
not
make
them
to
know
the
sea
outside
the
hills
but
never
to
behold
it
only
by
the
sound
of
waves
to
pity
sailors
labouring
then
to
watch
the
sheltered
sun
coming
warmly
round
the
turn
like
a
guest
expected
full
of
gentle
glow
and
gladness
casting
shadow
far
away
as
a
thing
to
hug
itself
and
awakening
life
from
dew
and
hope
from
every
spreading
bud
and
then
to
fall
asleep
and
dream
that
the
fern
was
all
asparagus
alas
i
was
too
young
in
those
days
much
to
care
for
creature
comforts
or
to
let
pure
palate
have
things
that
would
improve
it
anything
went
down
with
me
as
it
does
with
most
of
us
too
late
we
know
the
good
from
bad
the
knowledge
is
no
pleasure
then
being
memorys
medicine
rather
than
the
wine
of
hope
now
mother
melldrum
kept
her
winter
in
this
vale
of
rocks
sheltering
from
the
wind
and
rain
within
the
devils
cheesering
which
added
greatly
to
her
fame
because
all
else
for
miles
around
were
afraid
to
go
near
it
after
dark
or
even
on
a
gloomy
day
under
eaves
of
lichened
rock
she
had
a
winding
passage
which
none
that
ever
i
knew
of
durst
enter
but
herself
and
to
this
place
i
went
to
seek
her
in
spite
of
all
misgivings
upon
a
sunday
in
lenten
season
when
the
sheep
were
folded
our
parson
as
if
he
had
known
my
intent
had
preached
a
beautiful
sermon
about
the
witch
of
endor
and
the
perils
of
them
that
meddle
wantonly
with
the
unseen
powers
and
therein
he
referred
especially
to
the
strange
noise
in
the
neighbourhood
and
upbraided
us
for
want
of
faith
and
many
other
backslidings
we
listened
to
him
very
earnestly
for
we
like
to
hear
from
our
betters
about
things
that
are
beyond
us
and
to
be
roused
up
now
and
then
like
sheep
with
a
good
dog
after
them
who
can
pull
some
wool
without
biting
nevertheless
we
could
not
see
how
our
want
of
faith
could
have
made
that
noise
especially
at
night
time
notwithstanding
which
we
believed
it
and
hoped
to
do
a
little
better
and
so
we
all
came
home
from
church
and
most
of
the
people
dined
with
us
as
they
always
do
on
sundays
because
of
the
distance
to
go
home
with
only
words
inside
them
the
parson
who
always
sat
next
to
mother
was
afraid
that
he
might
have
vexed
us
and
would
not
have
the
best
piece
of
meat
according
to
his
custom
but
soon
we
put
him
at
his
ease
and
showed
him
we
were
proud
of
him
and
then
he
made
no
more
to
do
but
accepted
the
best
of
the
sirloin
chapter
xviii
witchery
leads
to
witchcraft
although
wellnigh
the
end
of
march
the
wind
blew
wild
and
piercing
as
i
went
on
foot
that
afternoon
to
mother
melldrums
dwelling
it
was
safer
not
to
take
a
horse
lest
if
anything
vexed
her
she
should
put
a
spell
upon
him
as
had
been
done
to
farmer
snowes
stable
by
the
wise
woman
of
simonsbath
the
sun
was
low
on
the
edge
of
the
hills
by
the
time
i
entered
the
valley
for
i
could
not
leave
home
till
the
cattle
were
tended
and
the
distance
was
seven
miles
or
more
the
shadows
of
rocks
fell
far
and
deep
and
the
brown
dead
fern
was
fluttering
and
brambles
with
their
sere
leaves
hanging
swayed
their
tatters
to
and
fro
with
a
red
look
on
them
in
patches
underneath
the
crags
a
few
wild
goats
were
browsing
then
they
tossed
their
horns
and
fled
and
leaped
on
ledges
and
stared
at
me
moreover
the
sound
of
the
sea
came
up
and
went
the
length
of
the
valley
and
there
it
lapped
on
a
butt
of
rocks
and
murmured
like
a
shell
taking
things
one
with
another
and
feeling
all
the
lonesomeness
and
having
no
stick
with
me
i
was
much
inclined
to
go
briskly
back
and
come
at
a
better
season
and
when
i
beheld
a
tall
grey
shape
of
something
or
another
moving
at
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
where
the
shade
was
it
gave
me
such
a
stroke
of
fear
after
many
others
that
my
thumb
which
lay
in
mothers
bible
brought
in
my
big
pocket
for
the
sake
of
safety
shook
so
much
that
it
came
out
and
i
could
not
get
it
in
again
this
serves
me
right
i
said
to
myself
for
tampering
with
beelzebub
oh
that
i
had
listened
to
parson
and
thereupon
i
struck
aside
not
liking
to
run
away
quite
as
some
people
might
call
it
but
seeking
to
look
like
a
wanderer
who
was
come
to
see
the
valley
and
had
seen
almost
enough
of
it
herein
i
should
have
succeeded
and
gone
home
and
then
been
angry
at
my
want
of
courage
but
that
on
the
very
turn
and
bending
of
my
footsteps
the
woman
in
the
distance
lifted
up
her
staff
to
me
so
that
i
was
bound
to
stop
and
now
being
brought
face
to
face
by
the
will
of
god
as
one
might
say
with
anything
that
might
come
of
it
i
kept
myself
quite
straight
and
stiff
and
thrust
away
all
white
feather
trusting
in
my
bible
still
hoping
that
it
would
protect
me
though
i
had
disobeyed
it
but
upon
that
remembrance
my
conscience
took
me
by
the
leg
so
that
i
could
not
go
forward
all
this
while
the
fearful
woman
was
coming
near
and
more
near
to
me
and
i
was
glad
to
sit
down
on
a
rock
because
my
knees
were
shaking
so
i
tried
to
think
of
many
things
but
none
of
them
would
come
to
me
and
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
away
though
i
prayed
god
to
be
near
me
but
when
she
was
come
so
nigh
to
me
that
i
could
descry
her
features
there
was
something
in
her
countenance
that
made
me
not
dislike
her
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
visited
by
many
troubles
and
had
felt
them
one
by
one
yet
held
enough
of
kindly
nature
still
to
grieve
for
others
long
white
hair
on
either
side
was
falling
down
below
her
chin
and
through
her
wrinkles
clear
bright
eyes
seemed
to
spread
themselves
upon
me
though
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
i
was
taken
by
surprise
no
less
and
unable
to
say
anything
yet
eager
to
hear
the
silence
broken
and
longing
for
a
noise
or
two
thou
art
not
come
to
me
she
said
looking
through
my
simple
face
as
if
it
were
but
glass
to
be
struck
for
boneshave
nor
to
be
blessed
for
barngun
give
me
forth
thy
hand
john
ridd
and
tell
why
thou
art
come
to
me
but
i
was
so
much
amazed
at
her
knowing
my
name
and
all
about
me
that
i
feared
to
place
my
hand
in
her
power
or
even
my
tongue
by
speaking
have
no
fear
of
me
my
son
i
have
no
gift
to
harm
thee
and
if
i
had
it
should
be
idle
now
if
thou
hast
any
wit
tell
me
why
i
love
thee
i
never
had
any
wit
mother
i
answered
in
our
devonshire
way
and
never
set
eyes
on
thee
before
to
the
furthest
of
my
knowledge
and
yet
i
know
thee
as
well
john
as
if
thou
wert
my
grandson
remember
you
the
old
oare
oak
and
the
bog
at
the
head
of
exe
and
the
child
who
would
have
died
there
but
for
thy
strength
and
courage
and
most
of
all
thy
kindness
that
was
my
granddaughter
john
and
all
i
have
on
earth
to
love
now
that
she
came
to
speak
of
it
with
the
place
and
that
so
clearly
i
remembered
all
about
it
a
thing
that
happened
last
august
and
thought
how
stupid
i
must
have
been
not
to
learn
more
of
the
little
girl
who
had
fallen
into
the
black
pit
with
a
basketful
of
whortleberries
and
who
might
have
been
gulfed
if
her
little
dog
had
not
spied
me
in
the
distance
i
carried
her
on
my
back
to
mother
and
then
we
dressed
her
all
anew
and
took
her
where
she
ordered
us
but
she
did
not
tell
us
who
she
was
nor
anything
more
than
her
christian
name
and
that
she
was
eight
years
old
and
fond
of
fried
batatas
and
we
did
not
seek
to
ask
her
more
as
our
manner
is
with
visitors
but
thinking
of
this
little
story
and
seeing
how
she
looked
at
me
i
lost
my
fear
of
mother
melldrum
and
began
to
like
her
partly
because
i
had
helped
her
grandchild
and
partly
that
if
she
were
so
wise
no
need
would
have
been
for
me
to
save
the
little
thing
from
drowning
therefore
i
stood
up
and
said
though
scarcely
yet
established
in
my
power
against
hers
good
mother
the
shoe
she
lost
was
in
the
mire
and
not
with
us
and
we
could
not
match
it
although
we
gave
her
a
pair
of
sister
lizzies
my
son
what
care
i
for
her
shoe
how
simple
thou
art
and
foolish
according
to
the
thoughts
of
some
now
tell
me
for
thou
canst
not
lie
what
has
brought
thee
to
me
being
so
ashamed
and
bashful
i
was
halfinclined
to
tell
her
a
lie
until
she
said
that
i
could
not
do
it
and
then
i
knew
that
i
could
not
i
am
come
to
know
i
said
looking
at
a
rock
the
while
to
keep
my
voice
from
shaking
when
i
may
go
to
see
lorna
doone
no
more
could
i
say
though
my
mind
was
charged
to
ask
fifty
other
questions
but
although
i
looked
away
it
was
plain
that
i
had
asked
enough
i
felt
that
the
wise
woman
gazed
at
me
in
wrath
as
well
as
sorrow
and
then
i
grew
angry
that
any
one
should
seem
to
make
light
of
lorna
john
ridd
said
the
woman
observing
this
for
now
i
faced
her
bravely
of
whom
art
thou
speaking
is
it
a
child
of
the
men
who
slew
your
father
i
cannot
tell
mother
how
should
i
know
and
what
is
that
to
thee
it
is
something
to
thy
mother
john
and
something
to
thyself
i
trow
and
nothing
worse
could
befall
thee
i
waited
for
her
to
speak
again
because
she
had
spoken
so
sadly
that
it
took
my
breath
away
john
ridd

thou
hast
any

she
gazed
at
me
in
earnest
so
and
raised
her
voice
in
saying
it
until
the
whole
valley
curving
like
a
great
bell
echoed
doone
that
it
seemed
to
me
my
heart
was
gone
for
every
one
and
everything
if
it
were
gods
will
for
me
to
have
no
more
of
lorna
let
a
sign
come
out
of
the
rocks
and
i
would
try
to
believe
it
but
no
sign
came
and
i
turned
to
the
woman
and
longed
that
she
had
been
a
man
you
poor
thing
with
bones
and
blades

of

the

she
pointed
to
the
castlerock
where
upon
a
narrow
shelf
betwixt
us
and
the
coming
stars
a
bitter
fight
was
raging
a
fine
fat
sheep
with
an
honest
face
had
clomb
up
very
carefully
to
browse
on
a
bit
of
juicy
grass
now
the
dew
of
the
land
was
upon
it
to
him
from
an
upper
crag
a
lean
black
goat
came
hurrying
with
leaps
and
skirmish
of
the
horns
and
an
angry
noise
in
his
nostrils
the
goat
had
grazed
the
place
before
to
the
utmost
of
his
liking
cropping
in
and
out
with
jerks
as
their
manner
is
of
feeding
nevertheless
he
fell
on
the
sheep
with
fury
and
great
malice
the
simple
wether
was
much
inclined
to
retire
from
the
contest
but
looked
around
in
vain
for
any
way
to
peace
and
comfort
his
enemy
stood
between
him
and
the
last
leap
he
had
taken
there
was
nothing
left
him
but
to
fight
or
be
hurled
into
the
sea

hundred
feet
below

lie
down
i
shouted
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
dog
for
i
had
seen
a
battle
like
this
before
and
knew
that
the
sheep
had
no
chance
of
life
except
from
his
greater
weight
and
the
difficulty
of
moving
him

john
ridd
cried
mother
melldrum
mocking
me
but
without
a
sign
of
smiling
the
poor
sheep
turned
upon
my
voice
and
looked
at
me
so
piteously
that
i
could
look
no
longer
but
ran
with
all
my
speed
to
try
and
save
him
from
the
combat
he
saw
that
i
could
not
be
in
time
for
the
goat
was
bucking
to
leap
at
him
and
so
the
good
wether
stooped
his
forehead
with
the
harmless
horns
curling
aside
of
it
and
the
goat
flung
his
heels
up
and
rushed
at
him
with
quick
sharp
jumps
and
tricks
of
movement
and
the
points
of
his
long
horns
always
foremost
and
his
little
scut
cocked
like
a
gunhammer
as
i
ran
up
the
steep
of
the
rock
i
could
not
see
what
they
were
doing
but
the
sheep
must
have
fought
very
bravely
at
last
and
yielded
his
ground
quite
slowly
and
i
hoped
almost
to
save
him
but
just
as
my
head
topped
the
platform
of
rock
i
saw
him
flung
from
it
backward
with
a
sad
low
moan
and
a
gurgle
his
body
made
quite
a
short
noise
in
the
air
like
a
bucket
thrown
down
a
well
shaft
and
i
could
not
tell
when
it
struck
the
water
except
by
the
echo
among
the
rocks
so
wroth
was
i
with
the
goat
at
the
moment
being
somewhat
scant
of
breath
and
unable
to
consider
that
i
caught
him
by
the
right
hindleg
before
he
could
turn
from
his
victory
and
hurled
him
after
the
sheep
to
learn
how
he
liked
his
own
compulsion
chapter
xix
another
dangerous
interview
although
i
left
the
denes
at
once
having
little
heart
for
further
questions
of
the
wise
woman
and
being
afraid
to
visit
her
house
under
the
devils
cheesering
to
which
she
kindly
invited
me
and
although
i
ran
most
part
of
the
way
it
was
very
late
for
farmhouse
time
upon
a
sunday
evening
before
i
was
back
at
plovers
barrows
my
mother
had
great
desire
to
know
all
about
the
matter
but
i
could
not
reconcile
it
with
my
respect
so
to
frighten
her
therefore
i
tried
to
sleep
it
off
keeping
my
own
counsel
and
when
that
proved
of
no
avail
i
strove
to
work
it
away
it
might
be
by
heavy
outdoor
labour
and
weariness
and
good
feeding
these
indeed
had
some
effect
and
helped
to
pass
a
week
or
two
with
more
pain
of
hand
than
heart
to
me
but
when
the
weather
changed
in
earnest
and
the
frost
was
gone
and
the
southwest
wind
blew
softly
and
the
lambs
were
at
play
with
the
daisies
it
was
more
than
i
could
do
to
keep
from
thought
of
lorna
for
now
the
fields
were
spread
with
growth
and
the
waters
clad
with
sunshine
and
light
and
shadow
step
by
step
wandered
over
the
furzy
cleves
all
the
sides
of
the
hilly
wood
were
gathered
in
and
out
with
green
silvergrey
or
russet
points
according
to
the
several
manner
of
the
trees
beginning
and
if
one
stood
beneath
an
elm
with
any
heart
to
look
at
it
lo
all
the
ground
was
strewn
with
flakes
too
small
to
know
their
meaning
and
all
the
sprays
above
were
rasped
and
trembling
with
a
redness
and
so
i
stopped
beneath
the
tree
and
carved
ld
upon
it
and
wondered
at
the
buds
of
thought
that
seemed
to
swell
inside
me
the
upshot
of
it
all
was
this
that
as
no
lorna
came
to
me
except
in
dreams
or
fancy
and
as
my
life
was
not
worth
living
without
constant
sign
of
her
forth
i
must
again
to
find
her
and
say
more
than
a
man
can
tell
therefore
without
waiting
longer
for
the
moving
of
the
spring
dressed
i
was
in
grand
attire
so
far
as
i
had
gotten
it
and
thinking
my
appearance
good
although
with
doubts
about
it
being
forced
to
dress
in
the
haytallat
round
the
corner
of
the
woodstack
went
i
very
knowinglyfor
lizzies
eyes
were
wondrous
sharpand
then
i
was
sure
of
meeting
none
who
would
care
or
dare
to
speak
of
me
it
lay
upon
my
conscience
often
that
i
had
not
made
dear
annie
secret
to
this
history
although
in
all
things
i
could
trust
her
and
she
loved
me
like
a
lamb
many
and
many
a
time
i
tried
and
more
than
once
began
the
thing
but
there
came
a
dryness
in
my
throat
and
a
knocking
under
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
a
longing
to
put
it
off
again
as
perhaps
might
be
the
wisest
and
then
i
would
remember
too
that
i
had
no
right
to
speak
of
lorna
as
if
she
were
common
property
this
time
i
longed
to
take
my
gun
and
was
half
resolved
to
do
so
because
it
seemed
so
hard
a
thing
to
be
shot
at
and
have
no
chance
of
shooting
but
when
i
came
to
remember
the
steepness
and
the
slippery
nature
of
the
waterslide
there
seemed
but
little
likelihood
of
keeping
dry
the
powder
therefore
i
was
armed
with
nothing
but
a
good
stout
holly
staff
seasoned
well
for
many
a
winter
in
our
backkitchen
chimney
although
my
heart
was
leaping
high
with
the
prospect
of
some
adventure
and
the
fear
of
meeting
lorna
i
could
not
but
be
gladdened
by
the
softness
of
the
weather
and
the
welcome
way
of
everything
there
was
that
power
all
round
that
power
and
that
goodness
which
make
us
come
as
it
were
outside
our
bodily
selves
to
share
them
over
and
beside
us
breathes
the
joy
of
hope
and
promise
under
foot
are
troubles
past
in
the
distance
bowering
newness
tempts
us
ever
forward
we
quicken
with
largesse
of
life
and
spring
with
vivid
mystery
and
in
good
sooth
i
had
to
spring
and
no
mystery
about
it
ere
ever
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
rift
leading
into
dooneglade
for
the
stream
was
rushing
down
in
strength
and
raving
at
every
corner
a
mort
of
rain
having
fallen
last
night
and
no
wind
come
to
wipe
it
however
i
reached
the
head
ere
dark
with
more
difficulty
than
danger
and
sat
in
a
place
which
comforted
my
back
and
legs
desirably
hereupon
i
grew
so
happy
at
being
on
dry
land
again
and
come
to
look
for
lorna
with
pretty
trees
around
me
that
what
did
i
do
but
fall
asleep
with
the
hollystick
in
front
of
me
and
my
best
coat
sunk
in
a
bed
of
moss
with
water
and
woodsorrel
mayhap
i
had
not
done
so
nor
yet
enjoyed
the
spring
so
much
if
so
be
i
had
not
taken
three
parts
of
a
gallon
of
cider
at
home
at
plovers
barrows
because
of
the
lowness
and
sinking
ever
since
i
met
mother
melldrum
there
was
a
little
runnel
going
softly
down
beside
me
falling
from
the
upper
rock
by
the
means
of
moss
and
grass
as
if
it
feared
to
make
a
noise
and
had
a
mother
sleeping
now
and
then
it
seemed
to
stop
in
fear
of
its
own
dropping
and
wait
for
some
orders
and
the
blades
of
grass
that
straightened
to
it
turned
their
points
a
little
way
and
offered
their
allegiance
to
wind
instead
of
water
yet
before
their
carkled
edges
bent
more
than
a
driven
saw
down
the
water
came
again
with
heavy
drops
and
pats
of
running
and
bright
anger
at
neglect
this
was
very
pleasant
to
me
now
and
then
to
gaze
at
blinking
as
the
water
blinked
and
falling
back
to
sleep
again
suddenly
my
sleep
was
broken
by
a
shade
cast
over
me
between
me
and
the
low
sunlight
lorna
doone
was
standing
master
ridd
are
you
mad
she
said
and
took
my
hand
to
move
me
not
mad
but
half
asleep
i
answered
feigning
not
to
notice
her
that
so
she
might
keep
hold
of
me
come
away
come
away
if
you
care
for
life
the
patrol
will
be
here
directly
be
quick
master
ridd
let
me
hide
thee
i
will
not
stir
a
step
said
i
though
being
in
the
greatest
fright
that
might
be
well
imagined
unless
you
call
me
john
well
john
thenmaster
john
ridd
be
quick
if
you
have
any
to
care
for
you
i
have
many
that
care
for
me
i
said
just
to
let
her
know
and
i
will
follow
you
mistress
lorna
albeit
without
any
hurry
unless
there
be
peril
to
more
than
me
without
another
word
she
led
me
though
with
many
timid
glances
towards
the
upper
valley
to
and
into
her
little
bower
where
the
inlet
through
the
rock
was
i
am
almost
sure
that
i
spoke
before
though
i
cannot
now
go
seek
for
it
and
my
memory
is
but
a
wornout
tub
of
a
certain
deep
and
perilous
pit
in
which
i
was
like
to
drown
myself
through
hurry
and
fright
of
boyhood
and
even
then
i
wondered
greatly
and
was
vexed
with
lorna
for
sending
me
in
that
heedless
manner
into
such
an
entrance
but
now
it
was
clear
that
she
had
been
right
and
the
fault
mine
own
entirely
for
the
entrance
to
the
pit
was
only
to
be
found
by
seeking
it
inside
the
niche
of
native
stone
the
plainest
thing
of
all
to
see
at
any
rate
by
day
light
was
the
stairway
hewn
from
rock
and
leading
up
the
mountain
by
means
of
which
i
had
escaped
as
before
related
to
the
right
side
of
this
was
the
mouth
of
the
pit
still
looking
very
formidable
though
lorna
laughed
at
my
fear
of
it
for
she
drew
her
water
thence
but
on
the
left
was
a
narrow
crevice
very
difficult
to
espy
and
having
a
sweep
of
grey
ivy
laid
like
a
slouching
beaver
over
it
a
man
here
coming
from
the
brightness
of
the
outer
air
with
eyes
dazed
by
the
twilight
would
never
think
of
seeing
this
and
following
it
to
its
meaning
lorna
raised
the
screen
for
me
but
i
had
much
ado
to
pass
on
account
of
bulk
and
stature
instead
of
being
proud
of
my
size
as
it
seemed
to
me
she
ought
to
be
lorna
laughed
so
quietly
that
i
was
ready
to
knock
my
head
or
elbows
against
anything
and
say
no
more
about
it
however
i
got
through
at
last
without
a
word
of
compliment
and
broke
into
the
pleasant
room
the
lone
retreat
of
lorna
the
chamber
was
of
unhewn
rock
round
as
near
as
might
be
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
across
and
gay
with
rich
variety
of
fern
and
moss
and
lichen
the
fern
was
in
its
winter
still
or
coiling
for
the
springtide
but
moss
was
in
abundant
life
some
feathering
and
some
gobleted
and
some
with
fringe
of
red
to
it
overhead
there
was
no
ceiling
but
the
sky
itself
flaked
with
little
clouds
of
april
whitely
wandering
over
it
the
floor
was
made
of
soft
low
grass
mixed
with
moss
and
primroses
and
in
a
niche
of
shelter
moved
the
delicate
woodsorrel
here
and
there
around
the
sides
were
chairs
of
living
stone
as
some
latin
writer
says
whose
name
has
quite
escaped
me
and
in
the
midst
a
tiny
spring
arose
with
crystal
beads
in
it
and
a
soft
voice
as
of
a
laughing
dream
and
dimples
like
a
sleeping
babe
then
after
going
round
a
little
with
surprise
of
daylight
the
water
overwelled
the
edge
and
softly
went
through
lines
of
light
to
shadows
and
an
untold
bourne
while
i
was
gazing
at
all
these
things
with
wonder
and
some
sadness
lorna
turned
upon
me
lightly
as
her
manner
was
and
said
where
are
the
newlaid
eggs
master
ridd
or
hath
blue
hen
ceased
laying
i
did
not
altogether
like
the
way
in
which
she
said
it
with
a
sort
of
dialect
as
if
my
speech
could
be
laughed
at
here
be
some
i
answered
speaking
as
if
in
spite
of
her
i
would
have
brought
thee
twice
as
many
but
that
i
feared
to
crush
them
in
the
narrow
ways
mistress
lorna
and
so
i
laid
her
out
two
dozen
upon
the
moss
of
the
rockledge
unwinding
the
wisp
of
hay
from
each
as
it
came
safe
out
of
my
pocket
lorna
looked
with
growing
wonder
as
i
added
one
to
one
and
when
i
had
placed
them
side
by
side
and
bidden
her
now
to
tell
them
to
my
amazement
what
did
she
do
but
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
what
have
i
done
i
asked
with
shame
scarce
daring
even
to
look
at
her
because
her
grief
was
not
like
anniesa
thing
that
could
be
coaxed
away
and
left
a
joy
in
goingoh
what
have
i
done
to
vex
you
so
it
is
nothing
done
by
you
master
ridd
she
answered
very
proudly
as
if
nought
i
did
could
matter
it
is
only
something
that
comes
upon
me
with
the
scent
of
the
pure
true
cloverhay
moreover
you
have
been
too
kind
and
i
am
not
used
to
kindness
some
sort
of
awkwardness
was
on
me
at
her
words
and
weeping
as
if
i
would
like
to
say
something
but
feared
to
make
things
worse
perhaps
than
they
were
already
therefore
i
abstained
from
speech
as
i
would
in
my
own
pain
and
as
it
happened
this
was
the
way
to
make
her
tell
me
more
about
it
not
that
i
was
curious
beyond
what
pity
urged
me
and
the
strange
affairs
around
her
and
now
i
gazed
upon
the
floor
lest
i
should
seem
to
watch
her
but
none
the
less
for
that
i
knew
all
that
she
was
doing
lorna
went
a
little
way
as
if
she
would
not
think
of
me
nor
care
for
one
so
careless
and
all
my
heart
gave
a
sudden
jump
to
go
like
a
mad
thing
after
her
until
she
turned
of
her
own
accord
and
with
a
little
sigh
came
back
to
me
her
eyes
were
soft
with
troubles
shadow
and
the
proud
lift
of
her
neck
was
gone
and
beautys
vanity
borne
down
by
womans
want
of
sustenance
master
ridd
she
said
in
the
softest
voice
that
ever
flowed
between
two
lips
have
i
done
aught
to
offend
you
hereupon
it
went
hard
with
me
not
to
catch
her
up
and
kiss
her
in
the
manner
in
which
she
was
looking
only
it
smote
me
suddenly
that
this
would
be
a
low
advantage
of
her
trust
and
helplessness
she
seemed
to
know
what
i
would
be
at
and
to
doubt
very
greatly
about
it
whether
as
a
child
of
old
she
might
permit
the
usage
all
sorts
of
things
went
through
my
head
as
i
made
myself
look
away
from
her
for
fear
of
being
tempted
beyond
what
i
could
bear
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
i
said
within
my
heart
and
through
it
john
ridd
be
on
thy
very
best
manners
with
this
lonely
maiden
lorna
liked
me
all
the
better
for
my
good
forbearance
because
she
did
not
love
me
yet
and
had
not
thought
about
it
at
least
so
far
as
i
knew
and
though
her
eyes
were
so
beauteous
so
very
soft
and
kindly
there
was
to
my
apprehension
some
great
power
in
them
as
if
she
would
not
have
a
thing
unless
her
judgment
leaped
with
it
but
now
her
judgment
leaped
with
me
because
i
had
behaved
so
well
and
being
of
quick
urgent
naturesuch
as
i
delight
in
for
the
change
from
mine
own
slownessshe
without
any
let
or
hindrance
sitting
over
against
me
now
raising
and
now
dropping
fringe
over
those
sweet
eyes
that
were
the
roadlights
of
her
tongue
lorna
told
me
all
about
everything
i
wished
to
know
every
little
thing
she
knew
except
indeed
that
point
of
points
how
master
ridd
stood
with
her
although
it
wearied
me
no
whit
it
might
be
wearisome
for
folk
who
cannot
look
at
lorna
to
hear
the
story
all
in
speech
exactly
as
she
told
it
therefore
let
me
put
it
shortly
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
nay
pardon
me
whosoever
thou
art
for
seeming
fickle
and
rude
to
thee
i
have
tried
to
do
as
first
proposed
to
tell
the
tale
in
my
own
words
as
of
anothers
fortune
but
lo
i
was
beset
at
once
with
many
heavy
obstacles
which
grew
as
i
went
onward
until
i
knew
not
where
i
was
and
mingled
past
and
present
and
two
of
these
difficulties
only
were
enough
to
stop
me
the
one
that
i
must
coldly
speak
without
the
force
of
pity
the
other
that
i
off
and
on
confused
myself
with
lorna
as
might
be
well
expected
therefore
let
her
tell
the
story
with
her
own
sweet
voice
and
manner
and
if
ye
find
it
wearisome
seek
in
yourselves
the
weariness
chapter
xx
lorna
begins
her
story
i
cannot
go
through
all
my
thoughts
so
as
to
make
them
clear
to
you
nor
have
i
ever
dwelt
on
things
to
shape
a
story
of
them
i
know
not
where
the
beginning
was
nor
where
the
middle
ought
to
be
nor
even
how
at
the
present
time
i
feel
or
think
or
ought
to
think
if
i
look
for
help
to
those
around
me
who
should
tell
me
right
and
wrong
being
older
and
much
wiser
i
meet
sometimes
with
laughter
and
at
other
times
with
anger
there
are
but
two
in
the
world
who
ever
listen
and
try
to
help
me
one
of
them
is
my
grandfather
and
the
other
is
a
man
of
wisdom
whom
we
call
the
counsellor
my
grandfather
sir
ensor
doone
is
very
old
and
harsh
of
manner
except
indeed
to
me
he
seems
to
know
what
is
right
and
wrong
but
not
to
want
to
think
of
it
the
counsellor
on
the
other
hand
though
full
of
life
and
subtleties
treats
my
questions
as
of
play
and
not
gravely
worth
his
while
to
answer
unless
he
can
make
wit
of
them
and
among
the
women
there
are
none
with
whom
i
can
hold
converse
since
my
aunt
sabina
died
who
took
such
pains
to
teach
me
she
was
a
lady
of
high
repute
and
lofty
ways
and
learning
but
grieved
and
harassed
more
and
more
by
the
coarseness
and
the
violence
and
the
ignorance
around
her
in
vain
she
strove
from
year
to
year
to
make
the
young
men
hearken
to
teach
them
what
became
their
birth
and
give
them
sense
of
honour
it
was
her
favourite
word
poor
thing
and
they
called
her
old
aunt
honour
very
often
she
used
to
say
that
i
was
her
only
comfort
and
i
am
sure
she
was
my
only
one
and
when
she
died
it
was
more
to
me
than
if
i
had
lost
a
mother
for
i
have
no
remembrance
now
of
father
or
of
mother
although
they
say
that
my
father
was
the
eldest
son
of
sir
ensor
doone
and
the
bravest
and
the
best
of
them
and
so
they
call
me
heiress
to
this
little
realm
of
violence
and
in
sorry
sport
sometimes
i
am
their
princess
or
their
queen
many
people
living
here
as
i
am
forced
to
do
would
perhaps
be
very
happy
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
so
we
have
a
beauteous
valley
sheltered
from
the
cold
of
winter
and
power
of
the
summer
sun
untroubled
also
by
the
storms
and
mists
that
veil
the
mountains
although
i
must
acknowledge
that
it
is
apt
to
rain
too
often
the
grass
moreover
is
so
fresh
and
the
brook
so
bright
and
lively
and
flowers
of
so
many
hues
come
after
one
another
that
no
one
need
be
dull
if
only
left
alone
with
them
and
so
in
the
early
days
perhaps
when
morning
breathes
around
me
and
the
sun
is
going
upward
and
light
is
playing
everywhere
i
am
not
so
far
beside
them
all
as
to
live
in
shadow
but
when
the
evening
gathers
down
and
the
sky
is
spread
with
sadness
and
the
day
has
spent
itself
then
a
cloud
of
lonely
trouble
falls
like
night
upon
me
i
cannot
see
the
things
i
quest
for
of
a
world
beyond
me
i
cannot
join
the
peace
and
quiet
of
the
depth
above
me
neither
have
i
any
pleasure
in
the
brightness
of
the
stars
what
i
want
to
know
is
something
none
of
them
can
tell
mewhat
am
i
and
why
set
here
and
when
shall
i
be
with
them
i
see
that
you
are
surprised
a
little
at
this
my
curiosity
perhaps
such
questions
never
spring
in
any
wholesome
spirit
but
they
are
in
the
depths
of
mine
and
i
cannot
be
quit
of
them
meantime
all
around
me
is
violence
and
robbery
coarse
delight
and
savage
pain
reckless
joke
and
hopeless
death
is
it
any
wonder
that
i
cannot
sink
with
these
that
i
cannot
so
forget
my
soul
as
to
live
the
life
of
brutes
and
die
the
death
more
horrible
because
it
dreams
of
waking
there
is
none
to
lead
me
forward
there
is
none
to
teach
me
right
young
as
i
am
i
live
beneath
a
curse
that
lasts
for
ever
here
lorna
broke
down
for
awhile
and
cried
so
very
piteously
that
doubting
of
my
knowledge
and
of
any
power
to
comfort
i
did
my
best
to
hold
my
peace
and
tried
to
look
very
cheerful
then
thinking
that
might
be
bad
manners
i
went
to
wipe
her
eyes
for
her
master
ridd
she
began
again
i
am
both
ashamed
and
vexed
at
my
own
childish
folly
but
you
who
have
a
mother
who
thinks
you
say
so
much
of
you
and
sisters
and
a
quiet
home
you
cannot
tell
it
is
not
likely
what
a
lonely
nature
is
how
it
leaps
in
mirth
sometimes
with
only
heaven
touching
it
and
how
it
falls
away
desponding
when
the
dreary
weight
creeps
on
it
does
not
happen
many
times
that
i
give
way
like
this
more
shame
now
to
do
so
when
i
ought
to
entertain
you
sometimes
i
am
so
full
of
anger
that
i
dare
not
trust
to
speech
at
things
they
cannot
hide
from
me
and
perhaps
you
would
be
much
surprised
that
reckless
men
would
care
so
much
to
elude
a
young
girls
knowledge
they
used
to
boast
to
aunt
sabina
of
pillage
and
of
cruelty
on
purpose
to
enrage
her
but
they
never
boast
to
me
it
even
makes
me
smile
sometimes
to
see
how
awkwardly
they
come
and
offer
for
temptation
to
me
shining
packets
half
concealed
of
ornaments
and
finery
of
rings
or
chains
or
jewels
lately
belonging
to
other
people
but
when
i
try
to
search
the
past
to
get
a
sense
of
what
befell
me
ere
my
own
perception
formed
to
feel
back
for
the
lines
of
childhood
as
a
trace
of
gossamer
then
i
only
know
that
nought
lives
longer
than
god
wills
it
so
may
after
sin
go
by
for
we
are
children
always
as
the
counsellor
has
told
me
so
may
we
beyond
the
clouds
seek
this
infancy
of
life
and
never
find
its
memory
but
i
am
talking
now
of
things
which
never
come
across
me
when
any
work
is
toward
it
might
have
been
a
good
thing
for
me
to
have
had
a
father
to
beat
these
rovings
out
of
me
or
a
mother
to
make
a
home
and
teach
me
how
to
manage
it
for
being
left
with
nonei
think
and
nothing
ever
comes
of
it
nothing
i
mean
which
i
can
grasp
and
have
with
any
surety
nothing
but
faint
images
and
wonderment
and
wandering
but
often
when
i
am
neither
searching
back
into
remembrance
nor
asking
of
my
parents
but
occupied
by
trifles
something
like
a
sign
or
message
or
a
token
of
some
meaning
seems
to
glance
upon
me
whether
from
the
rustling
wind
or
sound
of
distant
music
or
the
singing
of
a
bird
like
the
sun
on
snow
it
strikes
me
with
a
pain
of
pleasure
and
often
when
i
wake
at
night
and
listen
to
the
silence
or
wander
far
from
people
in
the
grayness
of
the
evening
or
stand
and
look
at
quiet
water
having
shadows
over
it
some
vague
image
seems
to
hover
on
the
skirt
of
vision
ever
changing
place
and
outline
ever
flitting
as
i
follow
this
so
moves
and
hurries
me
in
the
eagerness
and
longing
that
straightway
all
my
chance
is
lost
and
memory
scared
like
a
wild
bird
flies
or
am
i
as
a
child
perhaps
chasing
a
flown
cageling
who
among
the
branches
free
plays
and
peeps
at
the
offered
cage
as
a
home
not
to
be
urged
on
him
and
means
to
take
his
time
of
coming
if
he
comes
at
all
often
too
i
wonder
at
the
odds
of
fortune
which
made
me
helpless
as
i
am
and
fond
of
peace
and
reading
the
heiress
of
this
mad
domain
the
sanctuary
of
unholiness
it
is
not
likely
that
i
shall
have
much
power
of
authority
and
yet
the
counsellor
creeps
up
to
be
my
lord
of
the
treasury
and
his
son
aspires
to
my
hand
as
of
a
royal
alliance
well
honour
among
thieves
they
say
and
mine
is
the
first
honour
although
among
decent
folk
perhaps
honesty
is
better
we
should
not
be
so
quiet
here
and
safe
from
interruption
but
that
i
have
begged
one
privilege
rather
than
commanded
it
this
was
that
the
lower
end
just
this
narrowing
of
the
valley
where
it
is
most
hard
to
come
at
might
be
looked
upon
as
mine
except
for
purposes
of
guard
therefore
none
beside
the
sentries
ever
trespass
on
me
here
unless
it
be
my
grandfather
or
the
counsellor
or
carver
by
your
face
master
ridd
i
see
that
you
have
heard
of
carver
doone
for
strength
and
courage
and
resource
he
bears
the
first
repute
among
us
as
might
well
be
expected
from
the
son
of
the
counsellor
but
he
differs
from
his
father
in
being
very
hot
and
savage
and
quite
free
from
argument
the
counsellor
who
is
my
uncle
gives
his
son
the
best
advice
commending
all
the
virtues
with
eloquence
and
wisdom
yet
himself
abstaining
from
them
accurately
and
impartially
you
must
be
tired
of
this
story
and
the
time
i
take
to
think
and
the
weakness
of
my
telling
but
my
life
from
day
to
day
shows
so
little
variance
among
the
riders
there
is
none
whose
safe
return
i
watch
fori
mean
none
more
than
otherand
indeed
there
seems
no
risk
all
are
now
so
feared
of
us
neither
of
the
old
men
is
there
whom
i
can
revere
or
love
except
alone
my
grandfather
whom
i
love
with
trembling
neither
of
the
women
any
whom
i
like
to
deal
with
unless
it
be
a
little
maiden
whom
i
saved
from
starving
a
little
cornish
girl
she
is
and
shaped
in
western
manner
not
so
very
much
less
in
width
than
if
you
take
her
lengthwise
her
father
seems
to
have
been
a
miner
a
cornishman
as
she
declares
of
more
than
average
excellence
and
better
than
any
two
men
to
be
found
in
devonshire
or
any
four
in
somerset
very
few
things
can
have
been
beyond
his
power
of
performance
and
yet
he
left
his
daughter
to
starve
upon
a
peatrick
she
does
not
know
how
this
was
done
and
looks
upon
it
as
a
mystery
the
meaning
of
which
will
some
day
be
clear
and
redound
to
her
fathers
honour
his
name
was
simon
carfax
and
he
came
as
the
captain
of
a
gang
from
one
of
the
cornish
stannaries
gwenny
carfax
my
young
maid
well
remembers
how
her
father
was
brought
up
from
cornwall
her
mother
had
been
buried
just
a
week
or
so
before
and
he
was
sad
about
it
and
had
been
off
his
work
and
was
ready
for
another
job
then
people
came
to
him
by
night
and
said
that
he
must
want
a
change
and
everybody
lost
their
wives
and
work
was
the
way
to
mend
it
so
what
with
grief
and
overthought
and
the
inside
of
a
square
bottle
gwenny
says
they
brought
him
off
to
become
a
mighty
captain
and
choose
the
country
round
the
last
she
saw
of
him
was
this
that
he
went
down
a
ladder
somewhere
on
the
wilds
of
exmoor
leaving
her
with
bread
and
cheese
and
his
travellinghat
to
see
to
and
from
that
day
to
this
he
never
came
above
the
ground
again
so
far
as
we
can
hear
of
but
gwenny
holding
to
his
hat
and
having
eaten
the
bread
and
cheese
when
he
came
no
more
to
help
her
dwelt
three
days
near
the
mouth
of
the
hole
and
then
it
was
closed
over
the
while
that
she
was
sleeping
with
weakness
and
with
want
of
food
she
lost
herself
distressfully
and
went
away
for
miles
or
more
and
lay
upon
a
peatrick
to
die
before
the
ravens
that
very
day
i
chanced
to
return
from
aunt
sabinas
dyingplace
for
she
would
not
die
in
glen
doone
she
said
lest
the
angels
feared
to
come
for
her
and
so
she
was
taken
to
a
cottage
in
a
lonely
valley
i
was
allowed
to
visit
her
for
even
we
durst
not
refuse
the
wishes
of
the
dying
and
if
a
priest
had
been
desired
we
should
have
made
bold
with
him
returning
very
sorrowful
and
caring
now
for
nothing
i
found
this
little
stray
thing
lying
her
arms
upon
her
and
not
a
sign
of
life
except
the
way
that
she
was
biting
black
rootstuff
was
in
her
mouth
and
a
piece
of
dirty
sheeps
wool
and
at
her
feet
an
old
eggshell
of
some
bird
of
the
moorland
i
tried
to
raise
her
but
she
was
too
square
and
heavy
for
me
and
so
i
put
food
in
her
mouth
and
left
her
to
do
right
with
it
and
this
she
did
in
a
little
time
for
the
victuals
were
very
choice
and
rare
being
what
i
had
taken
over
to
tempt
poor
aunt
sabina
gwenny
ate
them
without
delay
and
then
was
ready
to
eat
the
basket
and
the
ware
that
contained
them
gwenny
took
me
for
an
angelthough
i
am
little
like
one
as
you
see
master
ridd
and
she
followed
me
expecting
that
i
would
open
wings
and
fly
when
we
came
to
any
difficulty
i
brought
her
home
with
me
so
far
as
this
can
be
a
home
and
she
made
herself
my
sole
attendant
without
so
much
as
asking
me
she
has
beaten
two
or
three
other
girls
who
used
to
wait
upon
me
until
they
are
afraid
to
come
near
the
house
of
my
grandfather
she
seems
to
have
no
kind
of
fear
even
of
our
roughest
men
and
yet
she
looks
with
reverence
and
awe
upon
the
counsellor
as
for
the
wickedness
and
theft
and
revelry
around
her
she
says
it
is
no
concern
of
hers
and
they
know
their
own
business
best
by
this
way
of
regarding
men
she
has
won
upon
our
riders
so
that
she
is
almost
free
from
all
control
of
place
and
season
and
is
allowed
to
pass
where
none
even
of
the
youths
may
go
being
so
wide
and
short
and
flat
she
has
none
to
pay
her
compliments
and
were
there
any
she
would
scorn
them
as
not
being
cornishmen
sometimes
she
wanders
far
by
moonlight
on
the
moors
and
up
the
rivers
to
give
her
father
as
she
says
another
chance
of
finding
her
and
she
comes
back
not
a
wit
defeated
or
discouraged
or
depressed
but
confident
that
he
is
only
waiting
for
the
proper
time
herein
she
sets
me
good
example
of
a
patience
and
contentment
hard
for
me
to
imitate
oftentimes
i
am
vexed
by
things
i
cannot
meddle
with
yet
which
cannot
be
kept
from
me
that
i
am
at
the
point
of
flying
from
this
dreadful
valley
and
risking
all
that
can
betide
me
in
the
unknown
outer
world
if
it
were
not
for
my
grandfather
i
would
have
done
so
long
ago
but
i
cannot
bear
that
he
should
die
with
no
gentle
hand
to
comfort
him
and
i
fear
to
think
of
the
conflict
that
must
ensue
for
the
government
if
there
be
a
disputed
succession
ah
me
we
are
to
be
pitied
greatly
rather
than
condemned
by
people
whose
things
we
have
taken
from
them
for
i
have
read
and
seem
almost
to
understand
about
it
that
there
are
places
on
the
earth
where
gentle
peace
and
love
of
home
and
knowledge
of
ones
neighbours
prevail
and
are
with
reason
looked
for
as
the
usual
state
of
things
there
honest
folk
may
go
to
work
in
the
glory
of
the
sunrise
with
hope
of
coming
home
again
quite
safe
in
the
quiet
evening
and
finding
all
their
children
and
even
in
the
darkness
they
have
no
fear
of
lying
down
and
dropping
off
to
slumber
and
hearken
to
the
wind
of
night
not
as
to
an
enemy
trying
to
find
entrance
but
a
friend
who
comes
to
tell
the
value
of
their
comfort
of
all
this
golden
ease
i
hear
but
never
saw
the
like
of
it
and
haply
i
shall
never
do
so
being
born
to
turbulence
once
indeed
i
had
the
offer
of
escape
and
kinsmans
aid
and
high
place
in
the
gay
bright
world
and
yet
i
was
not
tempted
much
or
at
least
dared
not
to
trust
it
and
it
ended
very
sadly
so
dreadfully
that
i
even
shrink
from
telling
you
about
it
for
that
one
terror
changed
my
life
in
a
moment
at
a
blow
from
childhood
and
from
thoughts
of
play
and
commune
with
the
flowers
and
trees
to
a
sense
of
death
and
darkness
and
a
heavy
weight
of
earth
be
content
now

being
young
and
new
and
very
fond
of
hearing
things
to
make
my
blood
to
tingle
had
no
more
of
manners
than
to
urge
poor
lorna
onwards
hoping
perhaps
in
depth
of
heart
that
she
might
have
to
hold
by
me
when
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
of
it
therefore
she
went
on
again

her
story
it
is
not
a
twelvemonth
yet
although
it
seems
ten
years
agone
since
i
blew
the
downy
globe
to
learn
the
time
of
day
or
set
beneath
my
chin
the
veinings
of
the
varnished
buttercup
or
fired
the
foxglove
cannonade
or
made
a
captive
of
myself
with
dandelion
fetters
for
then
i
had
not
very
much
to
trouble
me
in
earnest
but
went
about
romancing
gravely
playing
at
bopeep
with
fear
making
for
myself
strong
heroes
of
gray
rock
or
firtree
adding
to
my
own
importance
as
the
children
love
to
do
as
yet
i
had
not
truly
learned
the
evil
of
our
living
the
scorn
of
law
the
outrage
and
the
sorrow
caused
to
others
it
even
was
a
point
with
all
to
hide
the
roughness
from
me
to
show
me
but
the
gallant
side
and
keep
in
shade
the
other
my
grandfather
sir
ensor
doone
had
given
strictest
order
as
i
discovered
afterwards
that
in
my
presence
all
should
be
seemly
kind
and
vigilant
nor
was
it
very
difficult
to
keep
most
part
of
the
mischief
from
me
for
no
doone
ever
robs
at
home
neither
do
they
quarrel
much
except
at
times
of
gambling
and
though
sir
ensor
doone
is
now
so
old
and
growing
feeble
his
own
way
he
will
have
still
and
no
one
dare
deny
him
even
our
fiercest
and
most
mighty
swordsmen
seared
from
all
sense
of
right
or
wrong
yet
have
plentiful
sense
of
fear
when
brought
before
that
whitehaired
man
not
that
he
is
rough
with
them
or
querulous
or
rebukeful
but
that
he
has
a
strange
soft
smile
and
a
gaze
they
cannot
answer
and
a
knowledge
deeper
far
than
they
have
of
themselves
under
his
protection
i
am
as
safe
from
all
those
men
some
of
whom
are
but
little
akin
to
me
as
if
i
slept
beneath
the
roof
of
the
kings
lord
justiciary
but
now
at
the
time
i
speak
of
one
evening
of
last
summer
a
horrible
thing
befell
which
took
all
play
of
childhood
from
me
the
fifteenth
day
of
last
july
was
very
hot
and
sultry
long
after
the
time
of
sundown
and
i
was
paying
heed
of
it
because
of
the
old
saying
that
if
it
rain
then
rain
will
fall
on
forty
days
thereafter
i
had
been
long
by
the
waterside
at
this
lower
end
of
the
valley
plaiting
a
little
crown
of
woodbine
crocketed
with
sprigs
of
heathto
please
my
grandfather
who
likes
to
see
me
gay
at
suppertime
being
proud
of
my
tiara
which
had
cost
some
trouble
i
set
it
on
my
head
at
once
to
save
the
chance
of
crushing
and
carrying
my
gray
hat
ventured
by
a
path
not
often
trod
for
i
must
be
home
at
the
suppertime
or
grandfather
would
be
exceeding
wrath
and
the
worst
of
his
anger
is
that
he
never
condescends
to
show
it
therefore
instead
of
the
open
mead
or
the
windings
of
the
river
i
made
short
cut
through
the
ashtrees
covert
which
lies
in
the
middle
of
our
vale
with
the
water
skirting
or
cleaving
it
you
have
never
been
up
so
far
as
thatat
least
to
the
best
of
my
knowledgebut
you
see
it
like
a
long
gray
spot
from
the
top
of
the
cliffs
above
us
here
i
was
not
likely
to
meet
any
of
our
people
because
the
young
ones
are
afraid
of
some
ancient
tale
about
it
and
the
old
ones
have
no
love
of
trees
where
gunshots
are
uncertain
it
was
more
almost
than
dusk
down
below
the
treeleaves
and
i
was
eager
to
go
through
and
be
again
beyond
it
for
the
gray
dark
hung
around
me
scarcely
showing
shadow
and
the
little
light
that
glimmered
seemed
to
come
up
from
the
ground
for
the
earth
was
strown
with
the
winterspread
and
coil
of
last
years
foliage
the
lichened
claws
of
chalky
twigs
and
the
numberless
decay
which
gives
a
light
in
its
decaying
i
for
my
part
hastened
shyly
ready
to
draw
back
and
run
from
hare
or
rabbit
or
small
fieldmouse
at
a
sudden
turn
of
the
narrow
path
where
it
stopped
again
to
the
river
a
man
leaped
out
from
behind
a
tree
and
stopped
me
and
seized
hold
of
me
i
tried
to
shriek
but
my
voice
was
still
i
could
only
hear
my
heart
now
cousin
lorna
my
good
cousin
he
said
with
ease
and
calmness
your
voice
is
very
sweet
no
doubt
from
all
that
i
can
see
of
you
but
i
pray
you
keep
it
still
unless
you
would
give
to
dusty
death
your
very
best
cousin
and
trusty
guardian
alan
brandir
of
loch
awe
you
my
guardian
i
said
for
the
idea
was
too
ludicrous
and
ludicrous
things
always
strike
me
first
through
some
fault
of
nature
i
have
in
truth
that
honour
madam
he
answered
with
a
sweeping
bow
unless
i
err
in
taking
you
for
mistress
lorna
doone
you
have
not
mistaken
me
my
name
is
lorna
doone
he
looked
at
me
with
gravity
and
was
inclined
to
make
some
claim
to
closer
consideration
upon
the
score
of
kinship
but
i
shrunk
back
and
only
said
yes
my
name
is
lorna
doone
then
i
am
your
faithful
guardian
alan
brandir
of
loch
awe
called
lord
alan
brandir
son
of
a
worthy
peer
of
scotland
now
will
you
confide
in
me
i
confide
in
you
i
cried
looking
at
him
with
amazement
why
you
are
not
older
than
i
am
yes
i
am
three
years
at
least
you
my
ward
are
not
sixteen
i
your
worshipful
guardian
am
almost
nineteen
years
of
age
upon
hearing
this
i
looked
at
him
for
that
seemed
then
a
venerable
age
but
the
more
i
looked
the
more
i
doubted
although
he
was
dressed
quite
like
a
man
he
led
me
in
a
courtly
manner
stepping
at
his
tallest
to
an
open
place
beside
the
water
where
the
light
came
as
in
channel
and
was
made
the
most
of
by
glancing
waves
and
fair
white
stones
now
am
i
to
your
liking
cousin
he
asked
when
i
had
gazed
at
him
until
i
was
almost
ashamed
except
at
such
a
stripling
does
my
cousin
lorna
judge
kindly
of
her
guardian
and
her
nearest
kinsman
in
a
word
is
our
admiration
mutual
truly
i
know
not
i
said
but
you
seem
goodnatured
and
to
have
no
harm
in
you
do
they
trust
you
with
a
sword
for
in
my
usage
among
men
of
stature
and
strong
presence
this
pretty
youth
so
tricked
and
slender
seemed
nothing
but
a
doll
to
me
although
he
scared
me
in
the
wood
now
that
i
saw
him
in
good
twilight
lo
he
was
but
little
greater
than
my
little
self
and
so
tasselled
and
so
ruffled
with
a
mint
of
bravery
and
a
green
coat
barred
with
red
and
a
slim
sword
hanging
under
him
it
was
the
utmost
i
could
do
to
look
at
him
halfgravely
i
fear
that
my
presence
hath
scarce
enough
of
ferocity
about
it
he
gave
a
jerk
to
his
sword
as
he
spoke
and
clanked
it
on
the
brookstones
yet
do
i
assure
you
cousin
that
i
am
not
without
some
prowess
and
many
a
master
of
defence
hath
this
good
sword
of
mine
disarmed
now
if
the
boldest
and
biggest
robber
in
all
this
charming
valley
durst
so
much
as
breathe
the
scent
of
that
flower
coronal
which
doth
not
adorn
but
is
adornedhere
he
talked
some
nonsensei
would
cleave
him
from
head
to
foot
ere
ever
he
could
fly
or
cry
hush
i
said
talk
not
so
loudly
or
thou
mayst
have
to
do
both
thyself
and
do
them
both
in
vain
for
he
was
quite
forgetting
now
in
his
bravery
before
me
where
he
stood
and
with
whom
he
spoke
and
how
the
summer
lightning
shone
above
the
hills
and
down
the
hollow
and
as
i
gazed
on
this
slight
fair
youth
clearly
one
of
high
birth
and
breeding
albeit
overboastful
a
chill
of
fear
crept
over
me
because
he
had
no
strength
or
substance
and
would
be
no
more
than
a
pincushion
before
the
great
swords
of
the
doones
i
pray
you
be
not
vexed
with
me
he
answered
in
a
softer
voice
for
i
have
travelled
far
and
sorely
for
the
sake
of
seeing
you
i
know
right
well
among
whom
i
am
and
that
their
hospitality
is
more
of
the
knife
than
the
saltstand
nevertheless
i
am
safe
enough
for
my
foot
is
the
fleetest
in
scotland
and
what
are
these
hills
to
me
tush
i
have
seen
some
border
forays
among
wilder
spirits
and
craftier
men
than
these
be
once
i
mind
some
years
agone
when
i
was
quite
a
stripling
lad
worshipful
guardian
i
said
there
is
no

for

if
thou
art
in
no
haste
i
am
and
cannot
stay

only
tell
me
how
i

under

to
thee

a

lord
in

councils

charles
the
second
appointed
me
to
learn
the
law
not
for
my
livelihood
thank
god
but
because
he
felt
the
lack
of
it
in
affairs

but
first
your
leave
young
mistress
lorna

cannot
lay
down
legal
maxims
without
aid
of
smoke
he
leaned
against
a
willowtree
and
drawing
from
a
gilded
box
a
little
dark
thing
like
a
stick
placed
it
between
his
lips
and
then
striking
a
flint
on
steel
made
fire
and
caught
it
upon
touchwood
with
this
he
kindled
the
tip
of
the
stick
until
it
glowed
with
a
ring
of
red
and
then
he
breathed
forth
curls
of
smoke
blue
and
smelling
on
the
air
like
spice
i
had
never
seen
this
done
before
though
acquainted
with
tobaccopipes
and
it
made
me
laugh
until
i
thought
of
the
peril
that
must
follow
it
cousin
have
no
fear
he
said
this
makes
me
all
the
safer
they
will
take
me
for
a
glowworm
and
thee
for
the
flower
it
shines
upon
but
to
returnof
law
i
learned
as
you
may
suppose
but
little
although
i
have
capacities
but
the
thing
was
far
too
dull
for
me
all
i
care
for
is
adventure
moving
chance
and
hot
encounter
therefore
all
of
law
i
learned
was
how
to
live
without
it
nevertheless
for
amusements
sake
as
i
must
needs
be
at
my
desk
an
hour
or
so
in
the
afternoon
i
took
to
the
sporting
branch
of
the
law
the
pitfalls
and
the
ambuscades
and
of
all
the
traps
to
be
laid
therein
pedigrees
are
the
rarest
there
is
scarce
a
man
worth
a

what
you
may
find
a
hole
in
his
shield
within
four
generations
and
so
i
struck
our
own
escutcheon
and
it
sounded
hollow
there
is
a
pointbut
heed
not
that
enough
that
being
curious
now
i
followed
up
the
quarry
and
i
am
come
to
this
at
lastwe
even
we
the
lords
of
loch
awe
have
an
outlaw
for
our
cousin
and
i
would
we
had
more
if
they
be
like
you
sir
i
answered
being
amused
by
his
manner
which
was
new
to
me
for
the
doones
are
much
in
earnest
surely
you
count
it
no
disgrace
to
be
of
kin
to
sir
ensor
doone
and
all
his
honest
family
if
it
be
so
it
is
in
truth
the
very
highest
honour
and
would
heal
ten
holes
in
our
escutcheon
what
noble
family
but
springs
from
a
captain
among
robbers
trade
alone
can
spoil
our
blood
robbery
purifies
it
the
robbery
of
one
age
is
the
chivalry
of
the
next
we
may
start
anew
and
vie
with
even
the
nobility
of
france
if
we
can
once
enrol
but
half
the
doones
upon
our
lineage
i
like
not
to
hear
you
speak
of
the
doones
as
if
they
were
no
more
than
that
i
exclaimed
being
now
unreasonable
but
will
you
tell
me
once
for
all
sir
how
you
are
my
guardian
that
i
will
do
you
are
my
ward
because
you
were
my
fathers
ward
under
the
scottish
law
and
now
my
father
being
so
deaf
i
have
succeeded
to
that
rightat
least
in
my
own
opinionunder
which
claim
i
am
here
to
neglect
my
trust
no
longer
but
to
lead
you
away
from
scenes
and
deeds
which
though
of
good
repute
and
comely
are
not
the
best
for
young
gentlewomen
there
spoke
i
not
like
a
guardian
after
that
can
you
mistrust
me
but
said
i
good
cousin
alan
if
i
may
so
call
you
it
is
not
meet
for
young
gentlewomen
to
go
away
with
young
gentlemen
though
fifty
times
their
guardians
but
if
you
will
only
come
with
me
and
explain
your
tale
to
my
grandfather
he
will
listen
to
you
quietly
and
take
no
advantage
of
you
i
thank
you
much
kind
mistress
lorna
to
lead
the
goose
into
the
foxs
den
but
setting
by
all
thought
of
danger
i
have
other
reasons
against
it
now
come
with
your
faithful
guardian
child
i
will
pledge
my
honour
against
all
harm
and
to
bear
you
safe
to
london
by
the
law
of
the
realm
i
am
now
entitled
to
the
custody
of
your
fair
person
and
of
all
your
chattels
but
sir
all
that
you
have
learned
of
law
is
how
to
live
without
it
fairly
met
fair
cousin
mine
your
wit
will
do
me
credit
after
a
little
sharpening
and
there
is
none
to
do
that
better
than
your
aunt
my
mother
although
she
knows
not
of
my
coming
she
is
longing
to
receive
you
come
and
in
a
few
months
time
you
shall
set
the
mode
at
court
instead
of
pining
here
and
weaving
coronals
of
daisies
i
turned
aside
and
thought
a
little
although
he
seemed
so
light
of
mind
and
gay
in
dress
and
manner
i
could
not
doubt
his
honesty
and
saw
beneath
his
jaunty
air
true
mettle
and
ripe
bravery
scarce
had
i
thought
of
his
project
twice
until
he
spoke
of
my
aunt
his
mother
but
then
the
form
of
my
dearest
friend
my
sweet
aunt
sabina
seemed
to
come
and
bid
me
listen
for
this
was
what
she
prayed
for
moreover
i
felt
though
not
as
now
that
doone
glen
was
no
place
for
me
or
any
proud
young
maiden
but
while
i
thought
the
yellow
lightning
spread
behind
a
bulk
of
clouds
three
times
ere
the
flash
was
done
far
off
and
void
of
thunder
and
from
the
pile
of
cloud
before
it
cut
as
from
black
paper
and
lit
to
depths
of
blackness
by
the
blaze
behind
it
a
form
as
of
an
aged
man
sitting
in
a
chair
loosemantled
seemed
to
lift
a
hand
and
warn
this
minded
me
of
my
grandfather
and
all
the
care
i
owed
him
moreover
now
the
storm
was
rising
and
i
began
to
grow
afraid
for
of
all
things
awful
to
me
thunder
is
the
dreadfulest
it
doth
so
growl
like
a
lion
coming
and
then
so
roll
and
roar
and
rumble
out
of
a
thickening
darkness
then
crack
like
the
last
trump
overhead
through
cloven
air
and
terror
that
all
my
heart
lies
low
and
quivers
like
a
weed
in
water
i
listened
now
for
the
distant
rolling
of
the
great
black
storm
and
heard
it
and
was
hurried
by
it
but
the
youth
before
me
waved
his
rolled
tobacco
at
it
and
drawled
in
his
daintiest
tone
and
manner
the
sky
is
having
a
smoke
i
see
and
dropping
sparks
and
grumbling
i
should
have
thought
these
exmoor
hills
too
small
to
gather
thunder
i
cannot
go
i
will
not
go
with
you
lord
alan
brandir
i
answered
being
vexed
a
little
by
those
words
of
his
you
are
not
grave
enough
for
me
you
are
not
old
enough
for
me
my
aunt
sabina
would
not
have
wished
it
nor
would
i
leave
my
grandfather
without
his
full
permission
i
thank
you
much
for
coming
sir
but
be
gone
at
once
by
the
way
you
came
and
pray
how
did
you
come
sir
fair
cousin
you
will
grieve
for
this
you
will
mourn
when
you
cannot
mend
it
i
would
my
mother
had
been
here
soon
would
she
have
persuaded
you
and
yet
he
added
with
the
smile
of
his
accustomed
gaiety
it
would
have
been
an
unco
thing
as
we
say
in
scotland
for
her
ladyship
to
have
waited
upon
you
as
her
graceless
son
has
done
and
hopes
to
do
again
ere
long
down
the
cliffs
i
came
and
up
them
i
must
make
way
back
again
now
adieu
fair
cousin
lorna
i
see
you
are
in
haste
tonight
but
i
am
right
proud
of
my
guardianship
give
me
just
one
flower
for
tokenhere
he
kissed
his
hand
to
me
and
i
threw
him
a
truss
of
woodbineadieu
fair
cousin
trust
me
well
i
will
soon
be
here
again
that
thou
never
shalt
sir
cried
a
voice
as
loud
as
a
culverin
and
carver
doone
had
alan
brandir
as
a
spider
hath
a
fly
the
boy
made
a
little
shriek
at
first
with
the
sudden
shock
and
the
terror
then
he
looked
methought
ashamed
of
himself
and
set
his
face
to
fight
for
it
very
bravely
he
strove
and
struggled
to
free
one
arm
and
grasp
his
sword
but
as
well
might
an
infant
buried
alive
attempt
to
lift
his
gravestone
carver
doone
with
his
great
arms
wrapped
around
the
slim
gay
body
smiled
as
i
saw
by
the
flash
from
heaven
at
the
poor
young
face
turned
up
to
him
then
as
a
nurse
bears
off
a
child
who
is
loath
to
go
to
bed
he
lifted
the
youth
from
his
feet
and
bore
him
away
into
the
darkness
i
was
young
then
i
am
older
now
older
by
ten
years
in
thought
although
it
is
not
a
twelvemonth
since
if
that
black
deed
were
done
again
i
could
follow
and
could
combat
it
could
throw
weak
arms
on
the
murderer
and
strive
to
be
murdered
also
i
am
now
at
home
with
violence
and
no
dark
death
surprises
me
but
being
as
i
was
that
night
the
horror
overcame
me
the
crash
of
thunder
overhead
the
last
despairing
look
the
deathpiece
framed
with
blaze
of
lightningmy
young
heart
was
so
affrighted
that
i
could
not
gasp
my
breath
went
from
me
and
i
knew
not
where
i
was
or
who
or
what
only
that
i
lay
and
cowered
under
great
trees
full
of
thunder
and
could
neither
count
nor
moan
nor
have
my
feet
to
help
me
yet
hearkening
as
a
coward
does
through
the
brushing
of
the
wind
and
echo
of
far
noises
i
heard
a
sharp
sound
as
of
iron
and
a
fall
of
heavy
wood
no
unmanly
shriek
came
with
it
neither
cry
for
mercy
carver
doone
knows
what
it
was
and
so
did
alan
brandir
here
lorna
doone
could
tell
no
more
being
overcome
with
weeping
only
through
her
tears
she
whispered
as
a
thing
too
bad
to
tell
that
she
had
seen
that
giant
carver
in
a
few
days
afterwards
smoking
a
little
round
brown
stick
like
those
of
her
poor
cousin
i
could
not
press
her
any
more
with
questions
or
for
clearness
although
i
longed
very
much
to
know
whether
she
had
spoken
of
it
to
her
grandfather
or
the
counsellor
but
she
was
now
in
such
condition
both
of
mind
and
body
from
the
force
of
her
own
fear
multiplied
by
telling
it
that
i
did
nothing
more
than
coax
her
at
a
distance
humbly
and
so
that
she
could
see
that
some
one
was
at
least
afraid
of
her
this
although
i
knew
not
women
in
those
days
as
now
i
do
and
never
shall
know
much
of
it
this
i
say
so
brought
her
round
that
all
her
fear
was
now
for
me
and
how
to
get
me
safely
off
without
mischance
to
any
one
and
sooth
to
say
in
spite
of
longing
just
to
see
if
master
carver
could
have
served
me
such
a
trickas
it
grew
towards
the
dusk
i
was
not
best
pleased
to
be
there
for
it
seemed
a
lawless
place
and
some
of
lornas
fright
stayed
with
me
as
i
talked
it
away
from
her
chapter
xxii
after
hearing
that
tale
from
lorna
i
went
home
in
sorry
spirits
having
added
fear
for
her
and
misery
about
to
all
my
other
ailments
and
was
it
not
quite
certain
now
that
she
being
owned
full
cousin
to
a
peer
and
lord
of
scotland
although
he
was
a
dead
one
must
have
nought
to
do
with
me
a
yeomans
son
and
bound
to
be
the
father
of
more
yeomen
i
had
been
very
sorry
when
first
i
heard
about
that
poor
young
popinjay
and
would
gladly
have
fought
hard
for
him
but
now
it
struck
me
that
after
all
he
had
no
right
to
be
there
prowling
as
it
were
for
lorna
without
any
invitation
and
we
farmers
love
not
trespass
still
if
i
had
seen
the
thing
i
must
have
tried
to
save
him
moreover
i
was
greatly
vexed
with
my
own
hesitation
stupidity
or
shyness
or
whatever
else
it
was
which
had
held
me
back
from
saying
ere
she
told
her
story
what
was
in
my
heart
to
say
videlicet
that
i
must
die
unless
she
let
me
love
her
not
that
i
was
fool
enough
to
think
that
she
would
answer
me
according
to
my
liking
or
begin
to
care
about
me
for
a
long
time
yet
if
indeed
she
ever
should
which
i
hardly
dared
to
hope
but
that
i
had
heard
from
men
more
skillful
in
the
matter
that
it
is
wise
to
be
in
time
that
so
the
maids
may
begin
to
think
when
they
know
that
they
are
thought
of
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
bitter
fears
on
account
of
her
wondrous
beauty
lest
some
young
fellow
of
higher
birth
and
finer
parts
and
finish
might
steal
in
before
poor
me
and
cut
me
out
altogether
thinking
of
which
i
used
to
double
my
great
fist
without
knowing
it
and
keep
it
in
my
pocket
ready
but
the
worst
of
all
was
this
that
in
my
great
dismay
and
anguish
to
see
lorna
weeping
so
i
had
promised
not
to
cause
her
any
further
trouble
from
anxiety
and
fear
of
harm
and
this
being
brought
to
practice
meant
that
i
was
not
to
show
myself
within
the
precincts
of
glen
doone
for
at
least
another
month
unless
indeed
as
i
contrived
to
edge
into
the
agreement
anything
should
happen
to
increase
her
present
trouble
and
every
days
uneasiness
in
that
case
she
was
to
throw
a
dark
mantle
or
covering
of
some
sort
over
a
large
white
stone
which
hung
within
the
entrance
to
her
retreati
mean
the
outer
entranceand
which
though
unseen
from
the
valley
itself
was
as
i
had
observed
conspicuous
from
the
height
where
i
stood
with
uncle
reuben
now
coming
home
so
sad
and
weary
yet
trying
to
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
love
oerleapeth
rank
and
must
still
be
lord
of
all
i
found
a
shameful
thing
going
on
which
made
me
very
angry
for
it
needs
must
happen
that
young
marwood
de
whichehalse
only
son
of
the
baron
riding
home
that
very
evening
from
chasing
of
the
exmoor
bustards
with
his
hounds
and
servingmen
should
take
the
short
cut
through
our
farmyard
and
being
dry
from
his
exercise
should
come
and
ask
for
drink
and
it
needs
must
happen
also
that
there
should
be
none
to
give
it
to
him
but
my
sister
annie
i
more
than
suspect
that
he
had
heard
some
report
of
our
annies
comeliness
and
had
a
mind
to
satisfy
himself
upon
the
subject
now
as
he
took
the
large
oxhorn
of
our
quarantineapple
cider
which
we
always
keep
apart
from
the
rest
being
too
good
except
for
the
quality
he
let
his
fingers
dwell
on
annies
by
some
sort
of
accident
while
he
lifted
his
beaver
gallantly
and
gazed
on
her
face
in
the
light
from
the
west
then
what
did
annie
do
as
she
herself
told
me
afterwards
but
make
her
very
best
curtsey
to
him
being
pleased
that
he
was
pleased
with
her
while
she
thought
what
a
fine
young
man
he
was
and
so
much
breeding
about
him
and
in
truth
he
was
a
dark
handsome
fellow
hasty
reckless
and
changeable
with
a
look
of
sad
destiny
in
his
black
eyes
that
would
make
any
woman
pity
him
what
he
was
thinking
of
our
annie
is
not
for
me
to
say
although
i
may
think
that
you
could
not
have
found
another
such
maiden
on
exmoor
except
of
course
my
lorna
though
young
squire
marwood
was
so
thirsty
he
spent
much
time
over
his
cider
or
at
any
rate
over
the
oxhorn
and
he
made
many
bows
to
annie
and
drank
health
to
all
the
family
and
spoke
of
me
as
if
i
had
been
his
very
best
friend
at
blundells
whereas
he
knew
well
enough
all
the
time
that
we
had
nought
to
say
to
one
another
he
being
three
years
older
and
therefore
of
course
disdaining
me
but
while
he
was
casting
about
perhaps
for
some
excuse
to
stop
longer
and
annie
was
beginning
to
fear
lest
mother
should
come
after
her
or
eliza
be
at
the
window
or
betty
up
in
pigs
house
suddenly
there
came
up
to
them
as
if
from
the
very
heart
of
the
earth
that
long
low
hollow
mysterious
sound
which
i
spoke
of
in
winter
the
young
man
started
in
his
saddle
let
the
horn
fall
on
the
horsesteps
and
gazed
all
around
in
wonder
while
as
for
annie
she
turned
like
a
ghost
and
tried
to
slam
the
door
but
failed
through
the
violence
of
her
trembling
for
never
till
now
had
any
one
heard
it
so
close
at
hand
as
you
might
say
or
in
the
mere
fall
of
the
twilight
and
by
this
time
there
was
no
man
at
least
in
our
parish
but
knewfor
the
parson
himself
had
told
us
sothat
it
was
the
devil
groaning
because
the
doones
were
too
many
for
him
marwood
de
whichehalse
was
not
so
alarmed
but
what
he
saw
a
fine
opportunity
he
leaped
from
his
horse
and
laid
hold
of
dear
annie
in
a
highly
comforting
manner
and
she
never
would
tell
us
about
it
being
so
shy
and
modest
whether
in
breathing
his
comfort
to
her
he
tried
to
take
some
from
her
pure
lips
i
hope
he
did
not
because
that
to
me
would
seem
not
the
deed
of
a
gentleman
and
he
was
of
good
old
family
at
this
very
moment
who
should
come
into
the
end
of
the
passage
upon
them
but
the
heavy
writer
of
these
doings
i
john
ridd
myself
and
walking
the
faster
it
may
be
on
account
of
the
noise
i
mentioned
i
entered
the
house
with
some
wrath
upon
me
at
seeing
the
gazehounds
in
the
yard
for
it
seems
a
cruel
thing
to
me
to
harass
the
birds
in
the
breedingtime
and
to
my
amazement
there
i
saw
squire
marwood
among
the
milkpans
with
his
arm
around
our
annies
waist
and
annie
all
blushing
and
coaxing
him
off
for
she
was
not
come
to
scold
yet
perhaps
i
was
wrong
god
knows
and
if
i
was
no
doubt
i
shall
pay
for
it
but
i
gave
him
the
flat
of
my
hand
on
his
head
and
down
he
went
in
the
thick
of
the
milkpans
he
would
have
had
my
fist
i
doubt
but
for
having
been
at
school
with
me
and
after
that
it
is
like
enough
he
would
never
have
spoken
another
word
as
it
was
he
lay
stunned
with
the
cream
running
on
him
while
i
took
poor
annie
up
and
carried
her
in
to
mother
who
had
heard
the
noise
and
was
frightened
concerning
this
matter
i
asked
no
more
but
held
myself
ready
to
bear
it
out
in
any
form
convenient
feeling
that
i
had
done
my
duty
and
cared
not
for
the
consequence
only
for
several
days
dear
annie
seemed
frightened
rather
than
grateful
but
the
oddest
result
of
it
was
that
eliza
who
had
so
despised
me
and
made
very
rude
verses
about
me
now
came
trying
to
sit
on
my
knee
and
kiss
me
and
give
me
the
best
of
the
pan
however
i
would
not
allow
it
because
i
hate
sudden
changes
another
thing
also
astonished
menamely
a
beautiful
letter
from
marwood
de
whichehalse
himself
sent
by
a
groom
soon
afterwards
in
which
he
apologised
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
his
equal
for
his
rudeness
to
my
sister
which
was
not
intended
in
the
least
but
came
of
their
common
alarm
at
the
moment
and
his
desire
to
comfort
her
also
he
begged
permission
to
come
and
see
me
as
an
old
schoolfellow
and
set
everything
straight
between
us
as
should
be
among
honest
blundellites
all
this
was
so
different
to
my
idea
of
fighting
out
a
quarrel
when
once
it
is
upon
a
man
that
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
but
bowed
to
higher
breeding
only
one
thing
i
resolved
upon
that
come
when
he
would
he
should
not
see
annie
and
to
do
my
sister
justice
she
had
no
desire
to
see
him
however
i
am
too
easy
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
being
very
quick
to
forgive
a
man
and
very
slow
to
suspect
unless
he
hath
once
lied
to
me
moreover
as
to
annie
it
had
always
seemed
to
me
much
against
my
wishes
that
some
shrewd
love
of
a
waiting
sort
was
between
her
and
tom
faggus
and
though
tom
had
made
his
fortune
now
and
everybody
respected
him
of
course
he
was
not
to
be
compared
in
that
point
of
respectability
with
those
people
who
hanged
the
robbers
when
fortune
turned
against
them
so
young
squire
marwood
came
again
as
though
i
had
never
smitten
him
and
spoke
of
it
in
as
light
a
way
as
if
we
were
still
at
school
together
it
was
not
in
my
nature
of
course
to
keep
any
anger
against
him
and
i
knew
what
a
condescension
it
was
for
him
to
visit
us
and
it
is
a
very
grievous
thing
which
touches
small
landowners
to
see
an
ancient
family
day
by
day
decaying
and
when
we
heard
that
ley
barton
itself
and
all
the
manor
of
lynton
were
under
a
heavy
mortgage
debt
to
john
lovering
of
wearegifford
there
was
not
much
in
our
little
way
that
we
would
not
gladly
do
or
suffer
for
the
benefit
of
de
whichehalse
meanwhile
the
work
of
the
farm
was
toward
and
every
day
gave
us
more
ado
to
dispose
of
what
itself
was
doing
for
after
the
long
dry
skeltering
wind
of
march
and
part
of
april
there
had
been
a
fortnight
of
soft
wet
and
when
the
sun
came
forth
again
hill
and
valley
wood
and
meadow
could
not
make
enough
of
him
many
a
spring
have
i
seen
since
then
but
never
yet
two
springs
alike
and
never
one
so
beautiful
or
was
it
that
my
love
came
forth
and
touched
the
world
with
beauty
the
spring
was
in
our
valley
now
creeping
first
for
shelter
shyly
in
the
pause
of
the
blustering
wind
there
the
lambs
came
bleating
to
her
and
the
orchis
lifted
up
and
the
thin
dead
leaves
of
clover
lay
for
the
new
ones
to
spring
through
there
the
stiffest
things
that
sleep
the
stubby
oak
and
the
saplind
beech
dropped
their
brown
defiance
to
her
and
prepared
for
a
soft
reply
while
her
overeager
children
who
had
started
forth
to
meet
her
through
the
frost
and
shower
of
sleet
catkind
hazel
goldgloved
withy
youthful
elder
and
old
woodbine
with
all
the
tribe
of
good
hedgeclimbers
who
must
hasten
while
haste
they
maywas
there
one
of
them
that
did
not
claim
the
merit
of
coming
first
there
she
stayed
and
held
her
revel
as
soon
as
the
fear
of
frost
was
gone
all
the
air
was
a
fount
of
freshness
and
the
earth
of
gladness
and
the
laughing
waters
prattled
of
the
kindness
of
the
sun
but
all
this
made
it
much
harder
for
us
plying
the
hoe
and
rake
to
keep
the
fields
with
room
upon
them
for
the
corn
to
tiller
the
winter
wheat
was
well
enough
being
sturdy
and
strongsided
but
the
spring
wheat
and
the
barley
and
the
oats
were
overrun
by
ill
weeds
growing
faster
therefore
as
the
old
saying
is
farmer
that
thy
wife
may
thrive
let
not
burr
and
burdock
wive
and
if
thou
wouldst
keep
thy
son
see
that
bine
and
gith
have
none
so
we
were
compelled
to
go
down
the
field
and
up
it
striking
in
and
out
with
care
where
the
green
blades
hung
together
so
that
each
had
space
to
move
in
and
to
spread
its
roots
abroad
and
i
do
assure
you
now
though
you
may
not
believe
me
it
was
harder
work
to
keep
john
fry
bill
dadds
and
jem
slocomb
all
in
a
line
and
all
moving
nimbly
to
the
tune
of
my
own
tool
than
it
was
to
set
out
in
the
morning
alone
and
hoe
half
an
acre
by
dinnertime
for
instead
of
keeping
the
good
ash
moving
they
would
for
ever
be
finding
something
to
look
at
or
to
speak
of
or
at
any
rate
to
stop
with
blaming
the
shape
of
their
tools
perhaps
or
talking
about
other
peoples
affairs
or
what
was
most
irksome
of
all
to
me
taking
advantage
as
married
men
and
whispering
jokes
of
no
excellence
about
my
having
or
having
not
or
being
ashamed
of
a
sweetheart
and
this
went
so
far
at
last
that
i
was
forced
to
take
two
of
them
and
knock
their
heads
together
after
which
they
worked
with
a
better
will
when
we
met
together
in
the
evening
round
the
kitchen
chimneyplace
after
the
men
had
had
their
supper
and
their
heavy
boots
were
gone
my
mother
and
eliza
would
do
their
very
utmost
to
learn
what
i
was
thinking
of
not
that
we
kept
any
fire
now
after
the
crock
was
emptied
but
that
we
loved
to
see
the
ashes
cooling
and
to
be
together
at
these
times
annie
would
never
ask
me
any
crafty
questions
as
eliza
did
but
would
sit
with
her
hair
untwined
and
one
hand
underneath
her
chin
sometimes
looking
softly
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
knew
it
all
and
i
was
no
worse
off
than
she
but
strange
to
say
my
mother
dreamed
not
even
for
an
instant
that
it
was
possible
for
annie
to
be
thinking
of
such
a
thing
she
was
so
very
good
and
quiet
and
careful
of
the
linen
and
clever
about
the
cookery
and
fowls
and
baconcuring
that
people
used
to
laugh
and
say
she
would
never
look
at
a
bachelor
until
her
mother
ordered
her
but
i
perhaps
from
my
own
condition
and
the
sense
of
what
it
was
felt
no
certainty
about
this
and
even
had
another
opinion
as
was
said
before
often
i
was
much
inclined
to
speak
to
her
about
it
and
put
her
on
her
guard
against
the
approaches
of
tom
faggus
but
i
could
not
find
how
to
begin
and
feared
to
make
a
breach
between
us
knowing
that
if
her
mind
was
set
no
words
of
mine
would
alter
it
although
they
needs
must
grieve
her
deeply
moreover
i
felt
that
in
this
case
a
certain
homely
devonshire
proverb
would
come
home
to
me
that
one
i
mean
which
records
that
the
crock
was
calling
the
kettle
smutty
not
of
course
that
i
compared
my
innocent
maid
to
a
highwayman
but
that
annie
might
think
her
worse
and
would
be
too
apt
to
do
so
if
indeed
she
loved
tom
faggus
and
our
cousin
tom
by
this
time
was
living
a
quiet
and
godly
life
having
retired
almost
from
the
trade
except
when
he
needed
excitement
or
came
across
public
officers
and
having
won
the
esteem
of
all
whose
purses
were
in
his
power
perhaps
it
is
needless
for
me
to
say
that
all
this
time
while
my
month
was
runningor
rather
crawling
for
never
month
went
so
slow
as
that
with
meneither
weed
nor
seed
nor
cattle
nor
my
own
mothers
anxiety
nor
any
care
for
my
sister
kept
me
from
looking
once
every
day
and
even
twice
on
a
sunday
for
any
sign
of
lorna
for
my
heart
was
ever
weary
in
the
budding
valleys
and
by
the
crystal
waters
looking
at
the
lambs
in
fold
or
the
heifers
on
the
mill
labouring
in
trickled
furrows
or
among
the
beaded
blades
halting
fresh
to
see
the
sun
lift
over
the
goldenvapoured
ridge
or
doffing
hat
from
sweat
of
brow
to
watch
him
sink
in
the
low
gray
sea
be
it
as
it
would
of
day
of
work
or
night
or
slumber
it
was
a
weary
heart
i
bore
and
fear
was
on
the
brink
of
it
all
the
beauty
of
the
spring
went
for
happy
men
to
think
of
all
the
increase
of
the
year
was
for
other
eyes
to
mark
not
a
sign
of
any
sunrise
for
me
from
my
fount
of
life
not
a
breath
to
stir

dead

i
had
for
the

so
very
stout
an
appetite

none

any

the

i

in

at

and
tempted
me
with
the
whole
of
the
rack
and
even
talked
of
sending
to
porlock
for
a
druggist
who
came
there
twice
in

week

spent

in

in

for
being

about

nearly
half

i
lost

much
as

even
in

what

the

flows
from
our
land
into
his
and
which
he
is
bound
to
maintain
but
he
looked
at
me
in
a
superior
manner
and
said
business
young
man
in
business
time
i
had
other
reason
for
being
vexed
with
farmer
nicholas
just
now
viz
that
i
had
heard
a
rumour
after
church
one
sundaywhen
most
of
all
we
sorrow
over
the
sins
of
one
anotherthat
master
nicholas
snowe
had
been
seen
to
gaze
tenderly
at
my
mother
during
a
passage
of
the
sermon
wherein
the
parson
spoke
well
and
warmly
about
the
duty
of
christian
love
now
putting
one
thing
with
another
about
the
bees
and
about
some
ducks
and
a
bullock
with
a
broken
kneecap
i
more
than
suspected
that
farmer
nicholas
was
casting
sheeps
eyes
at
my
mother
not
only
to
save
all
further
trouble
in
the
matter
of
the
hurdle
but
to
override
me
altogether
upon
the
difficult
question
of
damming
and
i
knew
quite
well
that
john
frys
wife
never
came
to
help
at
the
washing
without
declaring
that
it
was
a
sin
for
a
welllooking
woman
like
mother
with
plenty
to
live
on
and
only
three
children
to
keep
all
the
farmers
for
miles
around
so
unsettled
in
their
minds
about
her
mother
used
to
answer
oh
fie
mistress
fry
be
good
enough
to
mind
your
own
business
but
we
always
saw
that
she
smoothed
her
apron
and
did
her
hair
up
afterwards
and
that
mistress
fry
went
home
at
night
with
a
cold
pigs
foot
or
a
bowl
of
dripping
therefore
on
that
very
night
as
i
could
not
well
speak
to
mother
about
it
without
seeming
undutiful
after
lighting
the
three
young
ladiesfor
so
in
sooth
they
called
themselvesall
the
way
home
with
our
stablelanthorn
i
begged
good
leave
of
farmer
nicholas
who
had
hung
some
way
behind
us
to
say
a
word
in
private
to
him
before
he
entered
his
own
house
wi
all
the
plaisure
in
laife
my
zon
he
answered
very
graciously
thinking
perhaps
that
i
was
prepared
to
speak
concerning
sally
now
farmer
nicholas
snowe
i
said
scarce
knowing
how
to
begin
it

promise
not
to
be
vexed
with
me

farmer
snowe
with
as
much
amazement
as
if
the
thing
were
impossible
why
who
ever
hath
been
dooin
of
it

the
wai
to
my
own
door
at
laste
and
have
a
raight
to
goo
there
and
he
shut
me
out
without
so
much
as
offering
me
a
drink
of
cider
the
next
afternoon
when
work
was
over
i
had
seen
to
the
horses
for
now
it
was
foolish
to
trust
john
fry
because
he
had
so
many
children
and
his
wife
had
taken
to
scolding
and
just
as
i
was
saying
to
myself
that
in
five
days
more
my
month
would
be
done
and
myself
free
to
seek
lorna
a
man
came
riding
up
from
the
ford
where
the
road
goes
through
the
lynn
stream
as
soon
as
i
saw
that
it
was
not
tom
faggus
i
went
no
farther
to
meet
him
counting
that
it
must
be
some
traveller
bound
for
brendon
or
cheriton
and
likely
enough
he
would
come
and
beg
for
a
draught
of
milk
or
cider
and
then
on
again
after
asking
the
way
but
instead
of
that
he
stopped
at
our
gate
and
stood
up
from
his
saddle
and
halloed
as
if
he
were
somebody
and
all
the
time
he
was
flourishing
a
white
thing
in
the
air
like
the
bands
our
parson
weareth
so
i
crossed
the
courtyard
to
speak
with
him
service
of
the
king
he
saith
service
of
our
lord
the
king
come
hither
thou
great
yokel
at
risk
of
fine
and
imprisonment
although
not
pleased
with
this
i
went
to
him
as
became
a
loyal
man
quite
at
my
leisure
however
for
there
is
no
man
born
who
can
hurry
me
though
i
hasten
for
any
woman
plover
barrows
farm
said
he
god
only
knows
how
tired
i
be
is
there
any
where
in
this
cursed
county
a
cursed
place
called
plover
barrows
farm
for
last
twenty
mile
at
least
they
told
me
twere
only
half
a
mile
farther
or
only
just
round
corner
now
tell
me
that
and
i
fain
would
thwack
thee
if
thou
wert
not
thrice
my
size
sir
i
replied
you
shall
not
have
the
trouble
this
is
plovers
barrows
farm
and
you
are
kindly
welcome
sheeps
kidneys
is
for
supper
and
the
ale
got
bright
from
the
tapping
but
why
do
you
think
ill
of
us
we
like
not
to
be
cursed
so
nay
i
think
no
ill
he
said
sheeps
kidneys
is
good
uncommon
good
if
they
do
them
without
burning
but
i
be
so
galled
in
the
saddle
ten
days
and
never
a
comely
meal
of
it
and
when
they
hear
kings
service
cried
they
give
me
the
worst
of
everything
all
the
way
down
from
london
i
had
a
rogue
of
a
fellow
in
front
of
me
eating
the
fat
of
the
land
before
me
and
every
one
bowing
down
to
him
he
could
go
three
miles
to
my
one
though
he
never
changed
his
horse
he
might
have
robbed
me
at
any
minute
if
i
had
been
worth
the
trouble
a
red
mare
he
rideth
strong
in
the
loins
and
pointed
quite
small
in
the
head
i
shall
live
to
see
him
hanged
yet
all
this
time
he
was
riding
across
the
straw
of
our
courtyard
getting
his
weary
legs
out
of
the
leathers
and
almost
afraid
to
stand
yet
a
coarsegrained
hardfaced
man
he
was
some
forty
years
of
age
or
so
and
of
middle
height
and
stature
he
was
dressed
in
a
dark
brown
riding
suit
none
the
better
for
exmoor
mud
but
fitting
him
very
differently
from
the
fashion
of
our
tailors
across
the
holsters
lay
his
cloak
made
of
some
red
skin
and
shining
from
the
sweating
of
the
horse
as
i
looked
down
on
his
stiff
bright
headpiece
small
quick
eyes
and
black
needly
beard
he
seemed
to
despise
me
too
much
as
i
thought
for
a
mere
ignoramus
and
country
bumpkin
annie
have
down
the
cut
ham
i
shouted
for
my
sister
was
come
to
the
door
by
chance
or
because
of
the
sound
of
a
horse
in
the
road
and
cut
a
few
rashers
of
hung
deers
meat
there
is
a
gentleman
come
to
sup
annie
and
fetch
the
hops
out
of
the
tap
with
a
skewer
that
it
may
run
more
sparkling
i
wish
i
may
go
to
a
place
never
meant
for
me
said
my
new
friend
now
wiping
his
mouth
with
the
sleeve
of
his
brown
riding
coat
if
ever
i
fell
among
such
good
folk
you
are
the
right
sort
and
no
error
therein
all
this
shall
go
in
your
favour
greatly
when
i
make
deposition
at
least
i
mean
if
it
be
as
good
in
the
eating
as
in
the
hearing
tis
a
supper
quite
fit
for
tom
faggus
himself
the
man
who
hath
stolen
my
victuals
so
and
that
hung
deers
meat
now
is
it
of
the
red
deer
running
wild
in
these
parts
to
be
sure
it
is
sir
i
answered
where
should
we
get
any
other
right
right
you
are
right
my
son
i
have
heard
that
the
flavour
is
marvellous
some
of
them
came
and
scared
me
so
in
the
fog
of
the
morning
that
i
hungered
for
them
ever
since
ha
ha
i
saw
their
haunches
but
the
young
lady
will
not
forgetart
sure
she
will
not
forget
it
you
may
trust
her
to
forget
nothing
sir
that
may
tempt
a
guest
to
his
comfort
in
faith
then
i
will
leave
my
horse
in
your
hands
and
be
off
for
it
half
the
pleasure
of
the
mouth
is
in
the
nose
beforehand
but
stay
almost
i
forgot
my
business
in
the
hurry
which
thy
tongue
hath
spread
through
my
lately
despairing
belly
hungry
i
am
and
sore
of
body
from
my
heels
right
upward
and
sorest
in
front
of
my
doublet
yet
may
i
not
rest
nor
bite
barleybread
until
i
have
seen
and
touched
john
ridd
god
grant
that
he
be
not
far
away
i
must
eat
my
saddle
if
it
be
so
have
no
fear
good
sir
i
answered
you
have
seen
and
touched
john
ridd
i
am
he
and
not
one
likely
to
go
beneath
a
bushel
it
would
take
a
large
bushel
to
hold
thee
john
ridd
in
the
name
of
the
king
his
majesty
charles
the
second
these
presents
he
touched
me
with
the
white
thing
which
i
had
first
seen
him
waving
and
which
i
now
beheld
to
be
sheepskin
such
as
they
call
parchment
it
was
tied
across
with
cord
and
fastened
down
in
every
corner
with
unsightly
dabs
of
wax
by
order
of
the
messenger
for
i
was
overfrightened
now
to
think
of
doing
anything
i
broke
enough
of
seals
to
keep
an
easter
ghost
from
rising
and
there
i
saw
my
name
in
large
god
grant
such
another
shock
may
never
befall
me
in
my
old
age
read
my
son
read
thou
great
fool
if
indeed
thou
canst
read
said
the
officer
to
encourage
me
there
is
nothing
to
kill
thee
boy
and
my
supper
will
be
spoiling
stare
not
at
me
so
thou
fool
thou
art
big
enough
to
eat
me
read
read
read
if
you
please
sir
what
is
your
name
i
asked
though
why
i
asked
him
i
know
not
except
from
fear
of
witchcraft
jeremy
stickles
is
my
name
lad
nothing
more
than
a
poor
apparitor
of
the
worshipful
court
of
kings
bench
and
at
this
moment
a
starving
one
and
no
supper
for
me
unless
thou
wilt
read
being
compelled
in
this
way
i
read
pretty
nigh
as
follows
not
that
i
give
the
whole
of
it
but
only
the
gist
and
the
emphasis
to
our
good
subject
john
ridd
etcdescribing
me
ever
so
much
better
than
i
knew
myselfby
these
presents
greeting
these
are
to
require
thee
in
the
name
of
our
lord
the
king
to
appear
in
person
before
the
right
worshipful
the
justices
of
his
majestys
bench
at
westminster
laying
aside
all
thine
own
business
and
there
to
deliver
such
evidence
as
is
within
thy
cognisance
touching
certain
matters
whereby
the
peace
of
our
said
lord
the
king
and
the
wellbeing
of
this
realm
is
are
or
otherwise
may
be
impeached
impugned
imperilled
or
otherwise
detrimented
as
witness
these
presents
and
then
there
were
four
seals
and
then
a
signature
i
could
not
make
out
only
that
it
began
with
a
j
and
ended
with
some
other
writing
done
almost
in
a
circle
underneath
was
added
in
a
different
handwriting
charges
will
be
borne
the
matter
is
full
urgent
the
messenger
watched
me
while
i
read
so
much
as
i
could
read
of
it
and
he
seemed
well
pleased
with
my
surprise
because
he
had
expected
it
then
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
i
looked
again
at
the
cover
and
on
the
top
of
it
i
saw
ride
ride
ride
on
his
gracious
majestys
business
spur
and
spare
not
it
may
be
supposed
by
all
who
know
me
that
i
was
taken
hereupon
with
such
a
giddiness
in
my
head
and
noisiness
in
my
ears
that
i
was
forced
to
hold
by
the
crook
driven
in
below
the
thatch
for
holding
of
the
hayrakes
there
was
scarcely
any
sense
left
in
me
only
that
the
thing
was
come
by
power
of
mother
melldrum
because
i
despised
her
warning
and
had
again
sought
lorna
but
the
officer
was
grieved
for
me
and
the
danger
to
his
supper
my
son
be
not
afraid
he
said
we
are
not
going
to
skin
thee
only
thou
tell
all
the
truth
and
it
shall
bebut
never
mind
i
will
tell
thee
all
about
it
and
how
to
come
out
harmless
if
i
find
thy
victuals
good
and
no
delay
in
serving
them
we
do
our
best
sir
without
bargain
said
i
to
please
our
visitors
but
when
my
mother
saw
that
parchment
for
we
could
not
keep
it
from
her
she
fell
away
into
her
favourite
bed
of
stock
gillyflowers
which
she
had
been
tending
and
when
we
brought
her
round
again
did
nothing
but
exclaim
against
the
wickedness
of
the
age
and
people
it
was
useless
to
tell
her
she
knew
what
it
was
and
so
should
all
the
parish
know
the
king
had
heard
what
her
son
was
how
sober
and
quiet
and
diligent
and
the
strongest
young
man
in
england
and
being
himself
such
a
reprobategod
forgive
her
for
saying
sohe
could
never
rest
till
he
got
poor
johnny
and
made
him
as
dissolute
as
himself
and
if
he
did
thathere
mother
went
off
into
a
fit
of
crying
and
annie
minded
her
face
while
lizzie
saw
that
her
gown
was
in
comely
order
but
the
character
of
the
king
improved
when
master
jeremy
stickles
being
really
moved
by
the
look
of
it
and
no
bad
man
after
all
laid
it
clearly
before
my
mother
that
the
king
on
his
throne
was
unhappy
until
he
had
seen
john
ridd
that
the
fame
of
john
had
gone
so
far
and
his
size
and
all
his
virtuesthat
verily
by
the
god
who
made
him
the
king
was
overcome
with
it
then
mother
lay
back
in
her
garden
chair
and
smiled
upon
the
whole
of
us
and
most
of
all
on
jeremy
looking
only
shyly
on
me
and
speaking
through
some
break
of
tears
his
majesty
shall
have
my
john
his
majesty
is
very
good
but
only
for
a
fortnight
i
want
no
titles
for
him
johnny
is
enough
for
me
and
master
john
for
the
working
men
now
though
my
mother
was
so
willing
that
i
should
go
to
london
expecting
great
promotion
and
high
glory
for
me
i
myself
was
deeply
gone
into
the
pit
of
sorrow
for
what
would
lorna
think
of
me
here
was
the
long
month
just
expired
after
worlds
of
waiting
there
would
be
her
lovely
self
peeping
softly
down
the
glen
and
fearing
to
encourage
me
yet
there
would
be
nobody
else
and
what
an
insult
to
her
dwelling
upon
this
and
seeing
no
chance
of
escape
from
it
i
could
not
find
one
wink
of
sleep
though
jeremy
stickles
who
slept
close
by
snored
loud
enough
to
spare
me
some
for
i
felt
myself
to
be
as
it
were
in
a
place
of
some
importance
in
a
situation
of
trust
i
may
say
and
bound
not
to
depart
from
it
for
who
could
tell
what
the
king
might
have
to
say
to
me
about
the
doonesand
i
felt
that
they
were
at
the
bottom
of
this
strange
appearanceor
what
his
majesty
might
think
if
after
receiving
a
message
from
him
trusty
under
so
many
seals
i
were
to
violate
his
faith
in
me
as
a
churchwardens
son
and
falsely
spread
his
words
abroad
perhaps
i
was
not
wise
in
building
such
a
wall
of
scruples
nevertheless
all
that
was
there
and
weighed
upon
me
heavily
and
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
to
this
that
even
lorna
must
not
know
the
reason
of
my
going
neither
anything
about
it
but
that
she
might
know
i
was
gone
a
long
way
from
home
and
perhaps
be
sorry
for
it
now
how
was
i
to
let
her
know
even
that
much
of
the
matter
without
breaking
compact
puzzling
on
this
i
fell
asleep
after
the
proper
time
to
get
up
nor
was
i
to
be
seen
at
breakfast
time
and
mother
being
quite
strange
to
that
was
very
uneasy
about
it
but
master
stickles
assured
her
that
the
kings
writ
often
had
that
effect
and
the
symptom
was
a
good
one
now
master
stickles
when
must
we
start
i
asked
him
as
he
lounged
in
the
yard
gazing
at
our
turkey
poults
picking
and
running
in
the
sun
to
the
tune
of
their
fathers
gobble
your
horse
was
greatly
foundered
sir
and
is
hardly
fit
for
the
road
today
and
smiler
was
sledding
yesterday
all
up
the
higher
cleve
and
none
of
the
rest
can
carry
me
in
a
few
more
years
replied
the
kings
officer
contemplating
me
with
much
satisfaction
twill
be
a
cruelty
to
any
horse
to
put
thee
on
his
back
john
master
stickles
by
this
time
was
quite
familiar
with
us
calling
me
jack
and
eliza
lizzie
and
what
i
liked
the
least
of
all
our
pretty
annie
nancy
that
will
be
as
god
pleases
sir
i
answered
him
rather
sharply
and
the
horse
that
suffers
will
not
be
thine
but
i
wish
to
know
when
we
must
start
upon
our
long
travel
to
london
town
i
perceive
that
the
matter
is
of
great
despatch
and
urgency
to
be
sure
so
it
is
my
son
but
i
see
a
yearling
turkey
there
him
i
mean
with
the
hop
in
his
walk
who
if
i
know
aught
of
fowls
would
roast
well
tomorrow
thy
mother
must
have
preparation
it
is
no
more
than
reasonable
now
have
that
turkey
killed
tonight
for
his
fatness
makes
me
long
for
him
and
we
will
have
him
for
dinner
tomorrow
with
perhaps
one
of
his
brethren
and
a
few
more
collops
of
red
deers
flesh
for
supper
and
then
on
the
friday
morning
with
the
grace
of
god
we
will
set
our
faces
to
the
road
upon
his
majestys
business
nay
but
good
sir
i
asked
with
some
trembling
so
eager
was
i
to
see
lorna
if
his
majestys
business
will
keep
till
friday
may
it
not
keep
until
monday
we
have
a
litter
of
suckingpigs
excellently
choice
and
white
six
weeks
old
come
friday
there
be
too
many
for
the
sow
and
one
of
them
needeth
roasting
think
you
not
it
would
be
a
pity
to
leave
the
women
to
carve
it
my
son
jack
replied
master
stickles
never
was
i
in
such
quarters
yet
and
god
forbid
that
i
should
be
so
unthankful
to
him
as
to
hurry
away
and
now
i
think
on
it
friday
is
not
a
day
upon
which
pious
people
love
to
commence
an
enterprise
i
will
choose
the
young
pig
tomorrow
at
noon
at
which
time
they
are
wont
to
gambol
and
we
will
celebrate
his
birthday
by
carving
him
on
friday
after
that
we
will
gird
our
loins
and
set
forth
early
on
saturday
now
this
was
little
better
to
me
than
if
we
had
set
forth
at
once
sunday
being
the
very
first
day
upon
which
it
would
be
honourable
for
me
to
enter
glen
doone
but
though
i
tried
every
possible
means
with
master
jeremy
stickles
offering
him
the
choice
for
dinner
of
every
beast
that
was
on
the
farm
he
durst
not
put
off
our
departure
later
than
the
saturday
and
nothing
else
but
love
of
us
and
of
our
hospitality
would
have
so
persuaded
him
to
remain
with
us
till
then
therefore
now
my
only
chance
of
seeing
lorna
before
i
went
lay
in
watching
from
the
cliff
and
espying
her
or
a
signal
from
her
this
however
i
did
in
vain
until
my
eyes
were
weary
and
often
would
delude
themselves
with
hope
of
what
they
ached
for
but
though
i
lay
hidden
behind
the
trees
upon
the
crest
of
the
stony
fall
and
waited
so
quiet
that
the
rabbits
and
squirrels
played
around
me
and
even
the
keeneyed
weasel
took
me
for
a
trunk
of
woodit
was
all
as
one
no
cast
of
colour
changed
the
white
stone
whose
whiteness
now
was
hateful
to
me
nor
did
wreath
or
skirt
of
maiden
break
the
loneliness
of
the
vale
chapter
xxiv
a
safe
pass
for
kings
messenger
a
journey
to
london
seemed
to
us
in
those
bygone
days
as
hazardous
and
dark
an
adventure
as
could
be
forced
on
any
man
i
mean
of
course
a
poor
man
for
to
a
great
nobleman
with
ever
so
many
outriders
attendants
and
retainers
the
risk
was
not
so
great
unless
the
highwaymen
knew
of
their
coming
beforehand
and
so
combined
against
them
to
a
poor
man
however
the
risk
was
not
so
much
from
those
gentlemen
of
the
road
as
from
the
more
ignoble
footpads
and
the
landlords
of
the
lesser
hostels
and
the
loose
unguarded
soldiers
over
and
above
the
pitfalls
and
the
quagmires
of
the
way
so
that
it
was
hard
to
settle
at
the
first
outgoing
whether
a
man
were
wise
to
pray
more
for
his
neck
or
for
his
head
but
nowadays
it
is
very
different
not
that
highwaymen
are
scarce
in
this
the
reign
of
our
good
queen
anne
for
in
truth
they
thrive
as
well
as
ever
albeit
they
deserve
it
not
being
less
upright
and
courteousbut
that
the
roads
are
much
improved
and
the
growing
use
of
stagewaggons
some
of
which
will
travel
as
much
as
forty
miles
in
a
summer
day
has
turned
our
ancient
ideas
of
distance
almost
upside
down
and
i
doubt
whether
god
be
pleased
with
our
flying
so
fast
away
from
him
however
that
is
not
my
business
nor
does
it
lie
in
my
mouth
to
speak
very
strongly
upon
the
subject
seeing
how
much
i
myself
have
done
towards
making
of
roads
upon
exmoor
to
return
to
my
story
and
in
truth
i
lose
that
road
too
often
it
would
have
taken
ten
kings
messengers
to
get
me
away
from
plovers
barrows
without
one
goodbye
to
lorna
but
for
my
sense
of
the
trust
and
reliance
which
his
majesty
had
reposed
in
me
and
now
i
felt
most
bitterly
how
the
very
arrangements
which
seemed
so
wise
and
indeed
ingenious
may
by
the
force
of
events
become
our
most
fatal
obstacles
for
lo
i
was
blocked
entirely
from
going
to
see
lorna
whereas
we
should
have
fixed
it
so
that
i
as
well
might
have
the
power
of
signalling
my
necessity
it
was
too
late
now
to
think
of
that
and
so
i
made
up
my
mind
at
last
to
keep
my
honour
on
both
sides
both
to
the
king
and
to
the
maiden
although
i
might
lose
everything
except
a
heavy
heart
for
it
and
indeed
more
hearts
than
mine
were
heavy
for
when
it
came
to
the
tug
of
parting
my
mother
was
like
and
so
was
annie
to
break
down
altogether
but
i
bade
them
be
of
good
cheer
and
smiled
in
the
briskest
manner
upon
them
and
said
that
i
should
be
back
next
week
as
one
of
his
majestys
greatest
captains
and
told
them
not
to
fear
me
then
upon
which
they
smiled
at
the
idea
of
ever
being
afraid
of
me
whatever
dress
i
might
have
on
and
so
i
kissed
my
hand
once
more
and
rode
away
very
bravely
but
bless
your
heart
i
could
no
more
have
done
so
than
flown
all
the
way
to
london
if
jeremy
stickles
had
not
been
there
and
not
to
take
too
much
credit
to
myself
in
this
matter
i
must
confess
that
when
we
were
come
to
the
turn
in
the
road
where
the
moor
begins
and
whence
you
see
the
last
of
the
yard
and
the
ricks
and
the
poultry
round
them
and
can
by
knowing
the
place
obtain
a
glance
of
the
kitchen
window
under
the
walnuttree
it
went
so
hard
with
me
just
here
that
i
even
made
pretence
of
a
stone
in
ancient
smilers
shoe
to
dismount
and
to
bend
my
head
awhile
then
knowing
that
those
i
had
left
behind
would
be
watching
to
see
the
last
of
me
and
might
have
false
hopes
of
my
coming
back
i
mounted
again
with
all
possible
courage
and
rode
after
jeremy
stickles
jeremy
seeing
how
much
i
was
down
did
his
best
to
keep
me
up
with
jokes
and
tales
and
light
discourse
until
before
we
had
ridden
a
league
i
began
to
long
to
see
the
things
he
was
describing
the
air
the
weather
and
the
thoughts
of
going
to
a
wondrous
place
added
to
the
fine
companyat
least
so
jeremy
said
it
wasof
a
man
who
knew
all
london
made
me
feel
that
i
should
be
ungracious
not
to
laugh
a
little
and
being
very
simple
then
i
laughed
no
more
a
little
but
something
quite
considerable
though
free
from
consideration
at
the
strange
things
master
stickles
told
me
and
his
strange
way
of
telling
them
and
so
we
became
very
excellent
friends
for
he
was
much
pleased
with
my
laughing
not
wishing
to
thrust
myself
more
forward
than
need
be
in
this
narrative
i
have
scarcely
thought
it
becoming
or
right
to
speak
of
my
own
adornments
but
now
what
with
the
brave
clothes
i
had
on
and
the
better
ones
still
that
were
packed
up
in
the
bag
behind
the
saddle
it
is
almost
beyond
me
to
forbear
saying
that
i
must
have
looked
very
pleasing
and
many
a
time
i
wished
going
along
that
lorna
could
only
be
here
and
there
watching
behind
a
furzebush
looking
at
me
and
wondering
how
much
my
clothes
had
cost
for
mother
would
have
no
stint
in
the
matter
but
had
assembled
at
our
house
immediately
upon
knowledge
of
what
was
to
be
about
london
every
man
known
to
be
a
good
stitcher
upon
our
side
of
exmoor
and
for
three
days
they
had
worked
their
best
without
stint
of
beer
or
cider
according
to
the
constitution
of
each
the
result
so
they
all
declared
was
such
as
to
create
admiration
and
defy
competition
in
london
and
to
me
it
seemed
that
they
were
quite
right
though
jeremy
stickles
turned
up
his
nose
and
feigned
to
be
deaf
in
the
business
now
be
that
matter
as
you
pleasefor
the
point
is
not
worth
arguingcertain
it
is
that
my
appearance
was
better
than
it
had
been
before
for
being
in
the
best
clothes
one
tries
to
look
and
to
act
so
far
as
may
be
up
to
the
quality
of
them
not
only
for
the
fear
of
soiling
them
but
that
they
enlarge
a
mans
perception
of
his
value
and
it
strikes
me
that
our
sins
arise
partly
from
disdain
of
others
but
mainly
from
contempt
of
self
both
working
the
despite
of
god
but
men
of
mind
may
not
be
measured
by
such
paltry
rule
as
this
by
dinnertime
we
arrived
at
porlock
and
dined
with
my
old
friend
master
pooke
now
growing
rich
and
portly
for
though
we
had
plenty
of
victuals
with
us
we
were
not
to
begin
upon
them
until
all
chance
of
victualling
among
our
friends
was
left
behind
and
during
that
first
day
we
had
no
need
to
meddle
with
our
store
at
all
for
as
had
been
settled
before
we
left
home
we
lay
that
night
at
dunster
in
the
house
of
a
worthy
tanner
first
cousin
to
my
mother
who
received
us
very
cordially
and
undertook
to
return
old
smiler
to
his
stable
at
plovers
barrows
after
one
days
rest
thence
we
hired
to
bridgwater
and
from
bridgwater
on
to
bristowe
breaking
the
journey
between
the
two
but
although
the
whole
way
was
so
new
to
me
and
such
a
perpetual
source
of
conflict
that
the
remembrance
still
abides
with
me
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
i
must
not
be
so
long
in
telling
as
it
was
in
travelling
or
you
will
wish
me
farther
both
because
lorna
was
nothing
there
and
also
because
a
man
in
our
neighbourhood
had
done
the
whole
of
it
since
my
time
and
feigns
to
think
nothing
of
it
however
one
thing
in
common
justice
to
a
person
who
has
been
traduced
i
am
bound
to
mention
and
this
is
that
being
two
of
us
and
myself
of
such
magnitude
we
never
could
have
made
our
journey
without
either
fight
or
running
but
for
the
free
pass
which
dear
annie
by
some
means
i
know
not
what
had
procured
from
master
faggus
and
when
i
let
it
be
known
by
some
hap
that
i
was
the
own
cousin
of
tom
faggus
and
honoured
with
his
society
there
was
not
a
house
upon
the
road
but
was
proud
to
entertain
me
in
spite
of
my
fellowtraveller
bearing
the
red
badge
of
the
king
i
will
keep
this
close
my
son
jack
he
said
having
stripped
it
off
with
a
carvingknife
your
flag
is
the
best
to
fly
the
man
who
starved
me
on
the
way
down
the
same
shall
feed
me
fat
going
home
therefore
we
pursued
our
way
in
excellent
condition
having
thriven
upon
the
credit
of
that
very
popular
highwayman
and
being
surrounded
with
regrets
that
he
had
left
the
profession
and
sometimes
begged
to
intercede
that
he
might
help
the
road
again
for
all
the
landlords
on
the
road
declared
that
now
small
ale
was
drunk
nor
much
of
spirits
called
for
because
the
farmers
need
not
prime
to
meet
only
common
riders
neither
were
these
worth
the
while
to
get
drunk
with
afterwards
master
stickles
himself
undertook
as
an
officer
of
the
kings
justices
to
plead
this
case
with
squire
faggus
as
everybody
called
him
now
and
to
induce
him
for
the
general
good
to
return
to
his
proper
ministry
it
was
a
long
and
weary
journey
although
the
roads
are
wondrous
good
on
the
farther
side
of
bristowe
and
scarcely
any
man
need
be
bogged
if
he
keeps
his
eyes
well
open
save
perhaps
in
berkshire
in
consequence
of
the
pass
we
had
and
the
vintners
knowledge
of
it
we
only
met
two
public
riders
one
of
whom
made
off
straightway
when
he
saw
my
companions
pistols
and
the
stout
carbine
i
bore
and
the
other
came
to
a
parley
with
us
and
proved
most
kind
and
affable
when
he
knew
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
cousin
of
squire
faggus
god
save
you
gentlemen
he
cried
lifting
his
hat
politely
many
and
many
a
happy
day
i
have
worked
this
road
with
him
such
times
will
never
be
again
but
commend
me
to
his
love
and
prayers
king
my
name
is
and
king
my
nature
say
that
and
none
will
harm
you
and
so
he
made
off
down
the
hill
being
a
perfect
gentleman
and
a
very
good
horse
he
was
riding
the
night
was
falling
very
thick
by
the
time
we
were
come
to
tyburn
and
here
the
kings
officer
decided
that
it
would
be
wise
to
halt
because
the
way
was
unsafe
by
night
across
the
fields
to
charing
village
i
for
my
part
was
nothing
loth
and
preferred
to
see
london
by
daylight
and
after
all
it
was
not
worth
seeing
but
a
very
hideous
and
dirty
place
not
at
all
like
exmoor
some
of
the
shops
were
very
fine
and
the
signs
above
them
finer
still
so
that
i
was
never
weary
of
standing
still
to
look
at
them
but
in
doing
this
there
was
no
ease
for
before
one
could
begin
almost
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
them
either
some
of
the
wayfarers
would
bustle
and
scowl
and
draw
their
swords
or
the
owner
or
his
apprentice
boys
would
rush
out
and
catch
hold
of
me
crying
buy
buy
buy
what
dye
lack
what
dye
lack
buy
buy
buy
at
first
i
mistook
the
meaning
of
thisfor
so
we
pronounce
the
word
boy
upon
exmoorand
i
answered
with
some
indignation
sirrah
i
am
no
boy
now
but
a
man
of
oneandtwenty
years
and
as
for
lacking
i
lack
naught
from
thee
except
what
thou
hast
notgood
manners
the
only
things
that
pleased
me
much
were
the
river
thames
and
the
hall
and
church
of
westminster
where
there
are
brave
things
to
be
seen
and
braver
still
to
think
about
but
whenever
i
wandered
in
the
streets
what
with
the
noise
the
people
made
the
number
of
the
coaches
the
running
of
the
footmen
the
swaggering
of
great
courtiers
and
the
thrusting
aside
of
everybody
many
and
many
a
time
i
longed
to
be
back
among
the
sheep
again
for
fear
of
losing
temper
they
were
welcome
to
the
wall
for
me
as
i
took
care
to
tell
them
for
i
could
stand
without
the
wall
which
perhaps
was
more
than
they
could
do
though
i
said
this
with
the
best
intention
meaning
no
discourtesy
some
of
them
were
vexed
at
it
and
one
young
lord
being
flushed
with
drink
drew
his
sword
and
made
at
me
but
i
struck
it
up
with
my
holly
stick
so
that
it
flew
on
the
roof
of
a
house
then
i
took
him
by
the
belt
with
one
hand
and
laid
him
in
the
kennel
this
caused
some
little
disturbance
but
none
of
the
rest
saw
fit
to
try
how
the
matter
might
be
with
them
now
this
being
the
year
of
our
lord
1683
more
than
nine
years
and
a
half
since
the
death
of
my
father
and
the
beginning
of
this
history
all
london
was
in
a
great
ferment
about
the
dispute
between
the
court
of
the
king
and
the
city
the
king
or
rather
perhaps
his
party
for
they
said
that
his
majesty
cared
for
little
except
to
have
plenty
of
money
and
spend
it
was
quite
resolved
to
be
supreme
in
the
appointment
of
the
chief
officers
of
the
corporation
but
the
citizens
maintained
that
under
their
charter
this
right
lay
entirely
with
themselves
upon
which
a
writ
was
issued
against
them
for
forfeiture
of
their
charter
and
the
question
was
now
being
tried
in
the
court
of
his
majestys
bench
this
seemed
to
occupy
all
the
attention
of
the
judges
and
my
case
which
had
appeared
so
urgent
was
put
off
from
time
to
time
while
the
court
and
the
city
contended
and
so
hot
was
the
conflict
and
hate
between
them
that
a
sheriff
had
been
fined
by
the
king
in
100000
pounds
and
a
former
lord
mayor
had
even
been
sentenced
to
the
pillory
because
he
would
not
swear
falsely
hence
the
courtiers
and
the
citizens
scarce
could
meet
in
the
streets
with
patience
or
without
railing
and
frequent
blows
now
although
i
heard
so
much
of
this
matter
for
nothing
else
was
talked
of
and
it
seeming
to
me
more
important
even
than
the
churchwardenship
of
oare
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
tell
which
side
i
should
take
to
for
all
my
sense
of
position
and
of
confidence
reposed
in
me
and
of
my
fathers
opinions
lay
heavily
in
one
scale
while
all
my
reason
and
my
heart
went
down
plump
against
injustice
and
seemed
to
win
the
other
scale
even
so
my
father
had
been
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
civil
war
when
he
was
less
than
my
age
now
and
even
less
skilled
in
politics
and
my
mother
told
me
after
this
when
she
saw
how
i
myself
was
doubting
and
vexed
with
myself
for
doing
so
that
my
father
used
to
thank
god
often
that
he
had
not
been
called
upon
to
take
one
side
or
other
but
might
remain
obscure
and
quiet
and
yet
he
always
considered
himself
to
be
a
good
sound
royalist
but
now
as
i
stayed
there
only
desirous
to
be
heard
and
to
get
away
and
scarcely
even
guessing
yet
what
was
wanted
of
me
for
even
jeremy
stickles
knew
not
or
pretended
not
to
know
things
came
to
a
dreadful
pass
between
the
king
and
all
the
people
who
dared
to
have
an
opinion
for
about
the
middle
of
june
the
judges
gave
their
sentence
that
the
city
of
london
had
forfeited
its
charter
and
that
its
franchise
should
be
taken
into
the
hands
of
the
king
scarcely
was
this
judgment
forth
and
all
men
hotly
talking
of
it
when
a
far
worse
thing
befell
news
of
some
great
conspiracy
was
spread
at
every
corner
and
that
a
man
in
the
malting
business
had
tried
to
take
up
the
brewers
work
and
lop
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
everybody
was
shocked
at
this
for
the
king
himself
was
not
disliked
so
much
as
his
advisers
but
everybody
was
more
than
shocked
grieved
indeed
to
the
heart
with
pain
at
hearing
that
lord
william
russell
and
mr
algernon
sidney
had
been
seized
and
sent
to
the
tower
of
london
upon
a
charge
of
high
treason
having
no
knowledge
of
these
great
men
nor
of
the
matter
how
far
it
was
true
i
had
not
very
much
to
say
about
either
of
them
or
it
but
this
silence
was
not
shared
although
the
ignorance
may
have
been
by
the
hundreds
of
people
around
me
such
a
commotion
was
astir
such
universal
sense
of
wrong
and
stern
resolve
to
right
it
that
each
man
grasped
his
fellows
hand
and
led
him
into
the
vintners
even
i
although
at
that
time
given
to
excess
in
temperance
and
afraid
of
the
name
of
cordials
was
hard
set
i
do
assure
you
not
to
be
drunk
at
intervals
without
coarse
discourtesy
however
that
as
betty
muxworthy
used
to
say
when
argued
down
and
ready
to
take
the
mop
for
it
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
have
naught
to
do
with
great
history
and
am
sorry
for
those
who
have
to
write
it
because
they
are
sure
to
have
both
friends
and
enemies
in
it
and
cannot
act
as
they
would
towards
them
without
damage
to
their
own
consciences
but
as
great
events
draw
little
ones
and
the
rattle
of
the
churn
decides
the
uncertainty
of
the
flies
so
this
movement
of
the
town
and
eloquence
and
passion
had
more
than
i
guessed
at
the
time
to
do
with
my
own
little
fortunes
for
in
the
first
place
it
was
fixed
perhaps
from
down
right
contumely
because
the
citizens
loved
him
so
that
lord
russell
should
be
tried
neither
at
westminster
nor
at
lincolns
inn
but
at
the
court
of
old
bailey
within
the
precincts
of
the
city
this
kept
me
hanging
on
much
longer
because
although
the
good
nobleman
was
to
be
tried
by
the
court
of
common
pleas
yet
the
officers
of
kings
bench
to
whom
i
daily
applied
myself
were
in
counsel
with
their
fellows
and
put
me
off
from
day
to
day
now
i
had
heard
of
the
laws
delays
which
the
greatest
of
all
great
poets
knowing
much
of
the
law
himself
as
indeed
of
everything
has
specially
mentioned
when
not
expected
among
the
many
ills
of
life
but
i
never
thought
at
my
years
to
have
such
bitter
experience
of
the
evil
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
lawyers
failed
to
do
their
duty
they
ought
to
pay
people
for
waiting
upon
them
instead
of
making
them
pay
for
it
but
here
i
was
now
in
the
second
month
living
at
my
own
charges
in
the
house
of
a
worthy
fellmonger
at
the
sign
of
the
seal
and
squirrel
abutting
upon
the
strand
road
which
leads
from
temple
bar
to
charing
here
i
did
very
well
indeed
having
a
mattress
of
good
skindressings
and
plenty
to
eat
every
day
of
my
life
but
the
butter
was
something
to
cry
but
thrice
at
according
to
a
conceit
of
our
school
days
and
the
milk
must
have
come
from
cows
driven
to
water
however
these
evils
were
light
compared
with
the
heavy
bill
sent
up
to
me
every
saturday
afternoon
and
knowing
how
my
mother
had
pinched
to
send
me
nobly
to
london
and
had
told
me
to
spare
for
nothing
but
live
bravely
with
the
best
of
them
the
tears
very
nearly
came
into
my
eyes
as
i
thought
while
i
ate
of
so
robbing
her
at
length
being
quite
at
the
end
of
my
money
and
seeing
no
other
help
for
it
i
determined
to
listen
to
clerks
no
more
but
force
my
way
up
to
the
justices
and
insist
upon
being
heard
by
them
or
discharged
from
my
recognisance
for
so
they
had
termed
the
bond
or
deed
which
i
had
been
forced
to
execute
in
the
presence
of
a
chief
clerk
or
notary
the
very
day
after
i
came
to
london
and
the
purport
of
it
was
that
on
pain
of
a
heavy
fine
or
escheatment
i
would
hold
myself
ready
and
present
to
give
evidence
when
called
upon
having
delivered
me
up
to
sign
this
jeremy
stickles
was
quit
of
me
and
went
upon
other
business
not
but
what
he
was
kind
and
good
to
me
when
his
time
and
pursuits
allowed
of
it
chapter
xxv
a
great
man
attends
to
business
having
seen
lord
russell
murdered
in
the
fields
of
lincolns
inn
or
rather
having
gone
to
see
it
but
turned
away
with
a
sickness
and
a
bitter
flood
of
tearsfor
a
whiter
and
a
nobler
neck
never
fell
before
low
beasti
strode
away
towards
westminster
cured
of
half
my
indignation
at
the
death
of
charles
the
first
many
people
hurried
past
me
chiefly
of
the
more
tender
sort
revolting
at
the
butchery
in
their
ghastly
faces
as
they
turned
them
back
lest
the
sight
should
be
coming
after
them
great
sorrow
was
to
be
seen
and
horror
and
pity
and
some
anger
in
westminster
hall
i
found
nobody
not
even
the
crowd
of
crawling
varlets
who
used
to
be
craving
evermore
for
employment
or
for
payment
i
knocked
at
three
doors
one
after
other
of
lobbies
going
out
of
it
where
i
had
formerly
seen
some
officers
and
people
pressing
in
and
out
but
for
my
trouble
i
took
nothing
except
some
thumps
from
echo
and
at
last
an
old
man
told
me
that
all
the
lawyers
were
gone
to
see
the
result
of
their
own
works
in
the
fields
of
lincolns
inn
however
in
a
few
days
time
i
had
better
fortune
for
the
court
was
sitting
and
full
of
business
to
clear
off
the
arrears
of
work
before
the
lawyers
holiday
as
i
was
waiting
in
the
hall
for
a
good
occasion
a
man
with
horsehair
on
his
head
and
a
long
blue
bag
in
his
left
hand
touched
me
gently
on
the
arm
and
led
me
into
a
quiet
place
i
followed
him
very
gladly
being
confident
that
he
came
to
me
with
a
message
from
the
justiciaries
but
after
taking
pains
to
be
sure
that
none
could
overhear
us
he
turned
on
me
suddenly
and
asked
now
john
how
is
your
dear
mother
worshipful
sir
i
answered
him
after
recovering
from
my
surprise
at
his
knowledge
of
our
affairs
and
kindly
interest
in
them
it
is
two
months
now
since
i
have
seen
her
would
to
god
that
i
only
knew
how
she
is
faring
now
and
how
the
business
of
the
farm
goes
sir
i
respect
and
admire
you
the
old
gentleman
replied
with
a
bow
very
low
and
genteel
few
young
courtgallants
of
our
time
are
so
reverent
and
dutiful
oh
how
i
did
love
my
mother
here
he
turned
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
in
a
manner
that
made
me
feel
for
him
and
yet
with
a
kind
of
wonder
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
sir
i
answered
most
respectfully
not
meaning
to
trespass
on
his
grief
yet
wondering
at
his
mothers
age
for
he
seemed
to
be
at
least
threescore
but
i
am
no
courtgallant
sir
i
am
only
a
farmers
son
and
learning
how
to
farm
a
little
enough
john
quite
enough
he
cried
i
can
read
it
in
thy
countenance
honesty
is
written
there
and
courage
and
simplicity
but
i
fear
that
in
this
town
of
london
thou
art
apt
to
be
taken
in
by
people
of
no
principle
ah
me
ah
me
the
world
is
bad
and
i
am
too
old
to
improve
it
then
finding
him
so
good
and
kind
and
anxious
to
improve
the
age
i
told
him
almost
everything
how
much
i
paid
the
fellmonger
and
all
the
things
i
had
been
to
see
and
how
i
longed
to
get
away
before
the
corn
was
ripening
yet
how
despite
of
these
desires
i
felt
myself
bound
to
walk
up
and
down
being
under
a
thing
called
recognisance
in
short
i
told
him
everything
except
the
nature
of
my
summons
which
i
had
no
right
to
tell
and
that
i
was
out
of
money
my
tale
was
told
in
a
little
archway
apart
from
other
lawyers
and
the
other
lawyers
seemed
to
me
to
shift
themselves
and
to
look
askew
like
sheep
through
a
hurdle
when
the
rest
are
feeding
what
good
god
my
lawyer
cried
smiting
his
breast
indignantly
with
a
roll
of
something
learned
in
what
country
do
we
live
under
what
laws
are
we
governed
no
case
before
the
court
whatever
no
primary
deposition
so
far
as
we
are
furnished
not
even
a
kings
writ
issuedand
here
we
have
a
fine
young
man
dragged
from
his
home
and
adoring
mother
during
the
height
of
agriculture
at
his
own
cost
and
charges
i
have
heard
of
many
grievances
but
this
the
very
worst
of
all
nothing
short
of
a
royal
commission
could
be
warranty
for
it
this
is
not
only
illegal
sir
but
most
gravely
unconstitutional
i
had
not
told
you
worthy
sir
i
answered
him
in
a
lower
tone
if
i
could
have
thought
that
your
sense
of
right
would
be
moved
so
painfully
but
now
i
must
beg
to
leave
you
sirfor
i
see
that
the
door
again
is
open
i
beg
you
worshipful
sir
to
accept
upon
this
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
said
nay
nay
my
son
not
two
not
two
yet
looking
away
that
he
might
not
scare
me
to
accept
kind
sir
my
very
best
thanks
and
most
respectful
remembrances
and
with
that
i
laid
my
hand
in
his
and
if
sir
any
circumstances
of
business
or
of
pleasure
should
bring
you
to
our
part
of
the
world
i
trust
you
will
not
forget
that
my
mother
and
myself
if
ever
i
get
home
again
will
do
our
best
to
make
you
comfortable
with
our
poor
hospitality
with
this
i
was
hasting
away
from
him
but
he
held
my
hand
and
looked
round
at
me
and
he
spoke
without
cordiality
young
man
a
general
invitation
is
no
entry
for
my
fee
book
i
have
spent
a
good
hour
of
businesstime
in
mastering
thy
case
and
stating
my
opinion
of
it
and
being
a
member
of
the
bar
called
sixandthirty
years
agone
by
the
honourable
society
of
the
inner
temple
my
fee
is
at
my
own
discretion
albeit
an
honorarium
for
the
honour
of
the
profession
and
my
position
in
it
i
ought
to
charge
thee
at
least
five
guineas
although
i
would
have
accepted
one
offered
with
good
will
and
delicacy
now
i
will
enter
it
two
my
son
and
half
a
crown
for
my
clerks
fee
saying
this
he
drew
forth
from
his
deep
blue
bag
a
red
book
having
clasps
to
it
and
endorsed
in
gold
letters
feebook
and
before
i
could
speak
being
frightened
so
he
had
entered
on
a
page
of
it
to
consideration
of
ease
as
stated
by
john
ridd
and
advising
thereupon
two
guineas
but
sir
good
sir
i
stammered
forth
not
having
two
guineas
left
in
the
world
yet
grieving
to
confess
it
i
knew
not
that
i
was
to
pay
learned
sir
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
way
wounds
of
god
in
what
way
thought
you
that
a
lawyer
listened
to
your
rigmarole
i
thought
that
you
listened
from
kindness
sir
and
compassion
of
my
grievous
case
and
a
sort
of
liking
for
me
a
lawyer
like
thee
young
curmudgeon
a
lawyer
afford
to
feel
compassion
gratis
either
thou
art
a
very
deep
knave
or
the
greenest
of
all
greenhorns
well
i
suppose
i
must
let
thee
off
for
one
guinea
and
the
clerks
fee
a
bad
business
a
shocking
business
now
if
this
man
had
continued
kind
and
soft
as
when
he
heard
my
story
i
would
have
pawned
my
clothes
to
pay
him
rather
than
leave
a
debt
behind
although
contracted
unwittingly
but
when
he
used
harsh
language
so
knowing
that
i
did
not
deserve
it
i
began
to
doubt
within
myself
whether
he
deserved
my
money
therefore
i
answered
him
with
some
readiness
such
as
comes
sometimes
to
me
although
i
am
so
slow
sir
i
am
no
curmudgeon
if
a
young
man
had
called
me
so
it
would
not
have
been
well
with
him
this
money
shall
be
paid
if
due
albeit
i
had
no
desire
to
incur
the
debt
you
have
advised
me
that
the
court
is
liable
for
my
expenses
so
far
as
they
be
reasonable
if
this
be
a
reasonable
expense
come
with
me
now
to
lord
justice
jeffreys
and
receive
from
him
the
two
guineas
or
it
may
be
five
for
the
counsel
you
have
given
me
to
deny
his
jurisdiction
with
these
words
i
took
his
arm
to
lead
him
for
the
door
was
open
still
in
the
name
of
god
boy
let
me
go
worthy
sir
pray
let
me
go
my
wife
is
sick
and
my
daughter
dyingin
the
name
of
god
sir
let
me
go
nay
nay
i
said
having
fast
hold
of
him
i
cannot
let
thee
go
unpaid
sir
right
is
right
and
thou
shalt
have
it
ruin
is
what
i
shall
have
boy
if
you
drag
me
before
that
devil
he
will
strike
me
from
the
bar
at
once
and
starve
me
and
all
my
family
here
lad
good
lad
take
these
two
guineas
thou
hast
despoiled
the
spoiler
never
again
will
i
trust
mine
eyes
for
knowledge
of
a
greenhorn
he
slipped
two
guineas
into
the
hand
which
i
had
hooked
through
his
elbow
and
spoke
in
an
urgent
whisper
again
for
the
people
came
crowding
around
usfor
gods
sake
let
me
go
boy
another
moment
will
be
too
late
learned
sir
i
answered
him
twice
you
spoke
unless
i
err
of
the
necessity
of
a
clerks
fee
as
a
thing
to
be
lamented
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
my
son
you
have
a
clerk
as
much
as
i
have
there
it
is
now
i
pray
thee
take
to
the
study
of
the
law
possession
is
nine
points
of
it
which
thou
hast
of
me
selfpossession
is
the
tenth
and
that
thou
hast
more
than
the
other
nine
being
flattered
by
this
and
by
the
feeling
of
the
two
guineas
and
halfcrown
i
dropped
my
hold
upon
counsellor
kitch
for
he
was
no
less
a
man
than
that
and
he
was
out
of
sight
in
a
second
of
time
wig
blue
bag
and
family
and
before
i
had
time
to
make
up
my
mind
what
i
should
do
with
his
money
for
of
course
i
meant
not
to
keep
it
the
crier
of
the
court
as
they
told
me
came
out
and
wanted
to
know
who
i
was
i
told
him
as
shortly
as
i
could
that
my
business
lay
with
his
majestys
bench
and
was
very
confidential
upon
which
he
took
me
inside
with
warning
and
showed
me
to
an
underclerk
who
showed
me
to
a
higher
one
and
the
higher
clerk
to
the
head
one
when
this
gentleman
understood
all
about
my
business
which
i
told
him
without
complaint
he
frowned
at
me
very
heavily
as
if
i
had
done
him
an
injury
john
ridd
he
asked
me
with
a
stern
glance
is
it
your
deliberate
desire
to
be
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
chief
justice
surely
sir
it
has
been
my
desire
for
the
last
two
months
and
more
then
john
thou
shalt
be
but
mind
one
thing
not
a
word
of
thy
long
detention
or
thou
mayst
get
into
trouble
how
sir
for
being
detained
against
my
own
wish
i
asked
him
but
he
turned
away
as
if
that
matter
were
not
worth
his
arguing
as
indeed
i
suppose
it
was
not
and
led
me
through
a
little
passage
to
a
door
with
a
curtain
across
it
now
if
my
lord
crossquestion
you
the
gentleman
whispered
to
me
answer
him
straight
out
truth
at
once
for
he
will
have
it
out
of
thee
and
mind
he
loves
not
to
be
contradicted
neither
can
he
bear
a
hangdog
look
take
little
heed
of
the
other
two
but
note
every
word
of
the
middle
one
and
never
make
him
speak
twice
i
thanked
him
for
his
good
advice
as
he
moved
the
curtain
and
thrust
me
in
but
instead
of
entering
withdrew
and
left
me
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
the
chamber
was
not
very
large
though
lofty
to
my
eyes
and
dark
with
wooden
panels
round
it
at
the
further
end
were
some
raised
seats
such
as
i
have
seen
in
churches
lined
with
velvet
and
having
broad
elbows
and
a
canopy
over
the
middle
seat
there
were
only
three
men
sitting
here
one
in
the
centre
and
one
on
each
side
and
all
three
were
done
up
wonderfully
with
fur
and
robes
of
state
and
curls
of
thick
gray
horsehair
crimped
and
gathered
and
plaited
down
to
their
shoulders
each
man
had
an
oak
desk
before
him
set
at
a
little
distance
and
spread
with
pens
and
papers
instead
of
writing
however
they
seemed
to
be
laughing
and
talking
or
rather
the
one
in
the
middle
seemed
to
be
telling
some
good
story
which
the
others
received
with
approval
by
reason
of
their
great
perukes
it
was
hard
to
tell
how
old
they
were
but
the
one
who
was
speaking
seemed
the
youngest
although
he
was
the
chief
of
them
a
thickset
burly
and
bulky
man
with
a
blotchy
broad
face
and
great
square
jaws
and
fierce
eyes
full
of
blazes
he
was
one
to
be
dreaded
by
gentle
souls
and
to
be
abhorred
by
the
noble
between
me
and
the
three
lord
judges
some
few
lawyers
were
gathering
up
bags
and
papers
and
pens
and
so
forth
from
a
narrow
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
as
if
a
case
had
been
disposed
of
and
no
other
were
called
on
but
before
i
had
time
to
look
round
twice
the
stout
fierce
man
espied
me
and
shouted
out
with
a
flashing
stare
how
now
countryman
who
art
thou
may
it
please
your
worship
i
answered
him
loudly
i
am
john
ridd
of
oare
parish
in
the
shire
of
somerset
brought
to
this
london
some
two
months
back
by
a
special
messenger
whose
name
is
jeremy
stickles
and
then
bound
over
to
be
at
hand
and
ready
when
called
upon
to
give
evidence
in
a
matter
unknown
to
me
but
touching
the
peace
of
our
lord
the
king
and
the
wellbeing
of
his
subjects
three
times
i
have
met
our
lord
the
king
but
he
hath
said
nothing
about
his
peace
and
only
held
it
towards
me
and
every
day
save
sunday
i
have
walked
up
and
down
the
great
hall
of
westminster
all
the
business
part
of
the
day
expecting
to
be
called
upon
yet
no
one
hath
called
upon
me
and
now
i
desire
to
ask
your
worship
whether
i
may
go
home

done
john
replied
his
lordship
while
i
was
panting
with
all
this
speech
i
will
go
bail
for
thee
john
thou
hast
never
made
such
a
long
speech
before
and
thou
art
a
spunky
briton
or
thou
couldst
not
have
made
it
now
i
remember
the
matter
well
and
i
myself
will
attend
to
it
although
it
arose
before
my
timehe
was
but
newly
chief
justicebut
i
cannot
take
it
now
john
there
is
no
fear
of
losing
thee
john
any
more
than
the
tower
of
london
i
grieve
for
his
majestys
exchequer
after
keeping
thee
two
months
or
more
nay
my
lord
i
crave
your
pardon
my
mother
hath
been
keeping
me
not
a
groat
have
i
received
spank
is
it
so
his
lordship
cried
in
a
voice
that
shook
the
cobwebs
and
the
frown
on
his
brow
shook
the
hearts
of
men
and
mine
as
much
as
the
rest
of
themspank
is
his
majesty
come
to
this
that
he
starves
his
own
approvers
my
lord
my
lord
whispered
mr
spank
the
chiefofficer
of
evidence
the
thing
hath
been
overlooked
my
lord
among
such
grave
matters
of
treason
i
will
overlook
thy
head
foul
spank
on
a
spike
from
temple
bar
if
ever
i
hear
of
the
like
again
vile
varlet
what
art
thou
paid
for
thou
hast
swindled
the
money
thyself
foul
spank
i
know
thee
though
thou
art
new
to
me
bitter
is
the
day
for
thee
that
ever
i
came
across
thee
answer
me
notone
word
more
and
i
will
have
thee
on
a
hurdle
and
he
swung
himself
to
and
fro
on
his
bench
with
both
hands
on
his
knees
and
every
man
waited
to
let
it
pass
knowing
better
than
to
speak
to
him
john
ridd
said
the
lord
chief
justice
at
last
recovering
a
sort
of
dignity
yet
daring
spank
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
to
do
so
much
as
look
at
him
thou
hast
been
shamefully
used
john
ridd
answer
me
not
boy
not
a
word
but
go
to
master
spank
and
let
me
know
how
he
behaves
to
thee
here
he
made
a
glance
at
spank
which
was
worth
at
least
ten
pounds
to
me
be
thou
here
again
tomorrow
and
before
any
other
case
is
taken
i
will
see
justice
done
to
thee
now
be
off
boy
thy
name
is
ridd
and
we
are
well
rid
of
thee
i
was
only
too
glad
to
go
after
all
this
tempest
as
you
may
well
suppose
for
if
ever
i
saw
a
mans
eyes
become
two
holes
for
the
devil
to
glare
from
i
saw
it
that
day
and
the
eyes
were
those
of
the
lord
chief
justice
jeffreys
mr
spank
was
in
the
lobby
before
me
and
before
i
had
recovered
myselffor
i
was
vexed
with
my
own
terrorhe
came
up
sidling
and
fawning
to
me
with
a
heavy
bag
of
yellow
leather
good
master
ridd
take
it
all
take
it
all
and
say
a
good
word
for
me
to
his
lordship
he
hath
taken
a
strange
fancy
to
thee
and
thou
must
make
the
most
of
it
we
never
saw
man
meet
him
eye
to
eye
so
and
yet
not
contradict
him
and
that
is
just
what
he
loveth
abide
in
london
master
ridd
and
he
will
make
thy
fortune
his
joke
upon
thy
name
proves
that
and
i
pray
you
remember
master
ridd
that
the
spanks
are
sixteen
in
family
but
i
would
not
take
the
bag
from
him
regarding
it
as
a
sort
of
bribe
to
pay
me
such
a
lump
of
money
without
so
much
as
asking
how
great
had
been
my
expenses
therefore
i
only
told
him
that
if
he
would
kindly
keep
the
cash
for
me
until
the
morrow
i
would
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
counting
which
always
is
sore
work
with
me
how
much
it
had
stood
me
in
board
and
lodging
since
master
stickles
had
rendered
me
up
for
until
that
time
he
had
borne
my
expenses
in
the
morning
i
would
give
mr
spank
a
memorandum
duly
signed
and
attested
by
my
landlord
including
the
breakfast
of
that
day
and
in
exchange
for
this
i
would
take
the
exact
amount
from
the
yellow
bag
and
be
very
thankful
for
it
if
that
is
thy
way
of
using
opportunity
said
spank
looking
at
me
with
some
contempt
thou
wilt
never
thrive
in
these
times
my
lad
even
the
lord
chief
justice
can
be
little
help
to
thee
unless
thou
knowest
better
than
that
how
to
help
thyself
it
mattered
not
to
me
the
word
approver
stuck
in
my
gorge
as
used
by
the
lord
chief
justice
for
we
looked
upon
an
approver
as
a
very
low
thing
indeed
i
would
rather
pay
for
every
breakfast
and
even
every
dinner
eaten
by
me
since
here
i
came
than
take
money
as
an
approver
and
indeed
i
was
much
disappointed
at
being
taken
in
that
light
having
understood
that
i
was
sent
for
as
a
trusty
subject
and
humble
friend
of
his
majesty
in
the
morning
i
met
mr
spank
waiting
for
me
at
the
entrance
and
very
desirous
to
see
me
i
showed
him
my
bill
made
out
in
fair
copy
and
he
laughed
at
it
and
said
take
it
twice
over
master
ridd
once
for
thine
own
sake
and
once
for
his
majestys
as
all
his
loyal
tradesmen
do
when
they
can
get
any
his
majesty
knows
and
is
proud
of
it
for
it
shows
their
love
of
his
countenance
and
he
says
bis
dat
qui
cito
dat
then
how
can
i
grumble
at
giving
twice
when
i
give
so
slowly
nay
i
will
take
it
but
once
i
said
if
his
majesty
loves
to
be
robbed
he
need
not
lack
of
his
desire
while
the
spanks
are
sixteen
in
family
the
clerk
smiled
cheerfully
at
this
being
proud
of
his
childrens
ability
and
then
having
paid
my
account
he
whispered
he
is
all
alone
this
morning
john
and
in
rare
good
humour
he
hath
been
promised
the
handling
of
poor
master
algernon
sidney
and
he
says
he
will
soon
make
republic
of
him
for
his
state
shall
shortly
be
headless
he
is
chuckling
over
his
joke
like
a
pig
with
a
nut
and
that
always
makes
him
pleasant
john
ridd
my
lord
with
that
he
swung
up
the
curtain
bravely
and
according
to
special
orders
i
stood
face
to
face
and
alone
with
judge
jeffreys
chapter
xxvi
john
is
drained
and
cast
aside
his
lordship
was
busy
with
some
letters
and
did
not
look
up
for
a
minute
or
two
although
he
knew
that
i
was
there
meanwhile
i
stood
waiting
to
make
my
bow
afraid
to
begin
upon
him
and
wondering
at
his
great
bullhead
then
he
closed
his
letters
wellpleased
with
their
import
and
fixed
his
bold
broad
stare
on
me
as
if
i
were
an
oyster
opened
and
he
would
know
how
fresh
i
was
may
it
please
your
worship
i
said
here
i
am
according
to
order
awaiting
your
good
pleasure
thou
art
made
to
weight
john
more
than
order
how
much
dost
thou
tip
the
scales
to
only
twelvescore
pounds
my
lord
when
i
be
in
wrestling
trim
and
sure
i
must
have
lost
weight
here
fretting
so
long
in
london
ha
ha
much
fret
is
there
in
thee
hath
his
majesty
seen
thee
yes
my
lord
twice
or
even
thrice
and
he
made
some
jest
concerning
me
a
very
bad
one
i
doubt
not
his
humour
is
not
so
dainty
as
mine
but
apt
to
be
coarse
and
unmannerly
now
john
or
jack
by
the
look
of
thee
thou
art
more
used
to
be
called
yes
your
worship
when
i
am
with
old
molly
and
betty
muxworthy
peace
thou
forward
varlet
there
is
a
deal
too
much
of
thee
we
shall
have
to
try
short
commons
with
thee
and
thou
art
a
very
long
common
ha
ha
where
is
that
rogue
spank
spank
must
hear
that
byandby
it
is
beyond
thy
great
thick
head
jack
not
so
my
lord
i
have
been
at
school
and
had
very
bad
jokes
made
upon
me
ha
ha
it
hath
hit
thee
hard
and
faith
it
would
be
hard
to
miss
thee
even
with
harpoon
and
thou
lookest
like
to
blubber
now
capital
in
faith
i
have
thee
on
every
side
jack
and
thy
sides
are
manifold
manyfolded
at
any
rate
thou
shalt
have
double
expenses
jack
for
the
wit
thou
hast
provoked
in
me
heavy
goods
lack
heavy
payment
is
a
proverb
down
our
way
my
lord
ah
i
hurt
thee
i
hurt
thee
jack
the
harpoon
hath
no
tickle
for
thee
now
jack
whale
having
hauled
thee
hard
we
will
proceed
to
examine
thee
here
all
his
manner
was
changed
and
he
looked
with
his
heavy
brows
bent
upon
me
as
if
he
had
never
laughed
in
his
life
and
would
allow
none
else
to
do
so
i
am
ready
to
answer
my
lord
i
replied
if
he
asks
me
nought
beyond
my
knowledge
or
beyond
my
honour
hadst
better
answer
me
everything
lump
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
honour
now
is
there
in
thy
neighbourhood
a
certain
nest
of
robbers
miscreants
and
outlaws
whom
all
men
fear
to
handle
yes
my
lord
at
least
i
believe
some
of
them
be
robbers
and
all
of
them
are
outlaws
and
what
is
your
high
sheriff
about
that
he
doth
not
hang
them
all
or
send
them
up
for
me
to
hang
without
more
to
do
about
them
i
reckon
that
he
is
afraid
my
lord
it
is
not
safe
to
meddle
with
them
they
are
of
good
birth
and
reckless
and
their
place
is
very
strong
good
birth
what
was
lord
russell
of
lord
essex
and
this
sidney
tis
the
surest
heirship
to
the
block
to
be
the
chip
of
a
good
one
what
is
the
name
of
this
pestilent
race
and
how
many
of
them
are
there
they
are
the
doones
of
bagworthy
forest
may
it
please
your
worship
and
we
reckon
there
be
about
forty
of
them
beside
the
women
and
children
forty
doones
all
forty
thieves
and
women
and
children
thunder
of
god
how
long
have
they
been
there
then
they
may
have
been
there
thirty
years
my
lord
and
indeed
they
may
have
been
forty
before
the
great
war
broke
out
they
came
longer
back
than
i
can
remember
ay
long
before
thou
wast
born
john
good
thou
speakest
plainly
woe
betide
a
liar
whenso
i
get
hold
of
him
ye
want
me
on
the
western
circuit
by
god
and
ye
shall
have
me
when
london
traitors
are
spun
and
swung
there
is
a
family
called

living
very
nigh

john
this
he
said
in
a
sudden
manner
as
if
to
take
me
off
my
guard
and
fixed
his
great
thick
eyes
on
me
and
in
truth
i
was
much
astonished
yes
my
lord
there
is
at
least
not
so
very
far
from
us
baron
de
whichehalse

taketh
dues
instead
of
his
majesty
somewhat
which
halts
there
ought
to
come
a
little
further
i
trow
it
shall
be
seen
to
as
well
as
the
witch
which
makes
it
so
to
halt
riotous
knaves
in
west
england
drunken
outlaws
you
shall
dance
if
ever
i
play
pipe
for
you
john
ridd
i
will
come
to
oare
parish
and
rout
out
the
oare
of
babylon
although
your
worship
is
so
learned
i
answered
seeing
that
now
he
was
beginning
to
make
things
uneasy
your
worship
though
being
chief
justice
does
little
justice
to
us
we
are
downright
good
and
loyal
folk
and
i
have
not
seen
since
here
i
came
to
this
great
town
of
london
any
who
may
better
us
or
even
come
anigh
us
in
honesty
and
goodness
and
duty
to
our
neighbours
for
we
are
very
quiet
folk
not
prating
our
own
virtues
enough
good
john
enough
knowest
thou
not
that
modesty
is
the
maidenhood
of
virtue
lost
even
by
her
own
approval
now
hast
thou
ever
heard
or
thought
that
de
whichehalse
is
in
league
with
the
doones
of
bagworthy
saying
these
words
rather
slowly
he
skewered
his
great
eyes
into
mine
so
that
i
could
not
think
at
all
neither
look
at
him
nor
yet
away
the
idea
was
so
new
to
me
that
it
set
my
wits
all
wandering
and
looking
into
me
he
saw
that
i
was
groping
for
the
truth
john
ridd
thine
eyes
are
enough
for
me
i
see
thou
hast
never
dreamed
of
it
now
hast
thou
ever
seen
a
man
whose
name
is
thomas
faggus
yes
sir
many
and
many
a
time
he
is
my
own
worthy
cousin
and
i
fear
he
that
hath
intentionshere
i
stopped
having
no
right
there
to
speak
about
our
annie
tom
faggus
is
a
good
man
he
said
and
his
great
square
face
had
a
smile
which
showed
me
he
had
met
my
cousin
master
faggus
hath
made
mistakes
as
to
the
title
to
property
as
lawyers
oftentimes
may
do
but
take
him
all
for
all
he
is
a
thoroughly
straightforward
man
presents
his
bill
and
has
it
paid
and
makes
no
charge
for
drawing
it
nevertheless
we
must
tax
his
costs
as
of
any
other
solicitor
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
my
lord
was
all
that
i
could
say
not
understanding
what
all
this
meant
i
fear
he
will
come
to
the
gallows
said
the
lord
chief
justice
sinking
his
voice
below
the
echoes
tell
him
this
from
me
jack
he
shall
never
be
condemned
before
me
but
i
cannot
be
everywhere
and
some
of
our
justices
may
keep
short
memory
of
his
dinners
tell
him
to
change
his
name
turn
parson
or
do
something
else
to
make
it
wrong
to
hang
him
parson
is
the
best
thing
he
hath
such
command
of
features
and
he
might
take
his
tithes
on
horseback
now
a
few
more
things
john
ridd
and
for
the
present
i
have
done
with
thee
all
my
heart
leaped
up
at
this
to
get
away
from
london
so
and
yet
i
could
hardly
trust
to
it
is
there
any
sound
round
your
way
of
disaffection
to
his
majesty
his
most
gracious
majesty
no
my
lord
no
sign
whatever
we
pray
for
him
in
church
perhaps
and
we
talk
about
him
afterwards
hoping
it
may
do
him
good
as
it
is
intended
but
after
that
we
have
naught
to
say
not
knowing
much
about
himat
least
till
i
get
home
again
that
is
as
it
should
be
john
and
the
less
you
say
the
better
but
i
have
heard
of
things
in
taunton
and
even
nearer
to
you
in
dulverton
and
even
nigher
still
upon
exmoor
things
which
are
of
the
pillory
kind
and
even
more
of
the
gallows
i
see
that
you
know
naught
of
them
nevertheless
it
will
not
be
long
before
all
england
hears
of
them
now
john
i
have
taken
a
liking
to
thee
for
never
man
told
me
the
truth
without
fear
or
favour
more
thoroughly
and
truly
than
thou
hast
done
keep
thou
clear
of
this
my
son
it
will
come
to
nothing
yet
many
shall
swing
high
for
it
even
i
could
not
save
thee
john
ridd
if
thou
wert
mixed
in
this
affair
keep
from
the
doones
keep
from
de
whichehalse
keep
from
everything
which
leads
beyond
the
sight
of
thy
knowledge
i
meant
to
use
thee
as
my
tool
but
i
see
thou
art
too
honest
and
simple
i
will
send
a
sharper
down
but
never
let
me
find
thee
john
either
a
tool
for
the
other
side
or
a
tube
for
my
words
to
pass
through
here
the
lord
justice
gave
me
such
a
glare
that
i
wished
myself
well
rid
of
him
though
thankful
for
his
warnings
and
seeing
how
he
had
made
upon
me
a
long
abiding
mark
of
fear
he
smiled
again
in
a
jocular
manner
and
said
now
get
thee
gone
jack
i
shall
remember
thee
and
i
trow
thou
wiltst
not
for
many
a
day
forget
me
my
lord
i
was
never
so
glad
to
go
for
the
hay
must
be
in
and
the
ricks
unthatched
and
none
of
them
can
make
spars
like
me
and
two
men
to
twist
every
hayrope
and
mother
thinking
it
all
right
and
listening
right
and
left
to
lies
and
cheated
at
every
pig
she
kills
and
even
the
skins
of
the
sheep
to
go
john
ridd
i
thought
none
could
come
nigh
your
folk
in
honesty
and
goodness
and
duty
to
their
neighbours
sure
enough
my
lord
but
by
our
folk
i
mean
ourselves
not
the
men
nor
women
neither
that
will
do
john
go
thy
way
not
men
nor
women
neither
are
better
than
they
need
be
i
wished
to
set
this
matter
right
but
his
worship
would
not
hear
me
and
only
drove
me
out
of
court
saying
that
men
were
thieves
and
liars
no
more
in
one
place
than
another
but
all
alike
all
over
the
world
and
women
not
far
behind
them
it
was
not
for
me
to
dispute
this
point
though
i
was
not
yet
persuaded
of
it
both
because
my
lord
was
a
judge
and
must
know
more
about
it
and
also
that
being
a
man
myself
i
might
seem
to
be
defending
myself
in
an
unbecoming
manner
therefore
i
made
a
low
bow
and
went
in
doubt
as
to
which
had
the
right
of
it
but
though
he
had
so
far
dismissed
me
i
was
not
yet
quite
free
to
go
inasmuch
as
i
had
not
money
enough
to
take
me
all
the
way
to
oare
unless
indeed
i
should
go
afoot
and
beg
my
sustenance
by
the
way
which
seemed
to
be
below
me
therefore
i
got
my
few
clothes
packed
and
my
few
debts
paid
all
ready
to
start
in
half
an
hour
if
only
they
would
give
me
enough
to
set
out
upon
the
road
with
for
i
doubted
not
being
young
and
strong
that
i
could
walk
from
london
to
oare
in
ten
days
or
in
twelve
at
most
which
was
not
much
longer
than
horsework
only
i
had
been
a
fool
as
you
will
say
when
you
hear
it
for
after
receiving
from
master
spank
the
amount
of
the
bill
which
i
had
deliveredless
indeed
by
fifty
shillings
than
the
money
my
mother
had
given
me
for
i
had
spent
fifty
shillings
and
more
in
seeing
the
town
and
treating
people
which
i
could
not
charge
to
his
majestyi
had
first
paid
all
my
debts
thereout
which
were
not
very
many
and
then
supposing
myself
to
be
an
established
creditor
of
the
treasury
for
my
coming
needs
and
already
scenting
the
country
air
and
foreseeing
the
joy
of
my
mother
what
had
i
done
but
spent
half
my
balance
ay
and
more
than
threequarters
of
it
upon
presents
for
mother
and
annie
and
lizzie
john
fry
and
his
wife
and
betty
muxworthy
bill
dadds
jim
slocombe
and
in
a
word
half
of
the
rest
of
the
people
at
oare
including
all
the
snowe
family
who
must
have
things
good
and
handsome
and
if
i
must
while
i
am
about
it
hide
nothing
from
those
who
read
me
i
had
actually
bought
for
lorna
a
thing
the
price
of
which
quite
frightened
me
till
the
shopkeeper
said
it
was
nothing
at
all
and
that
no
young
man
with
a
lady
to
love
him
could
dare
to
offer
her
rubbish
such
as
the
jew
sold
across
the
way
now
the
mere
idea
of
beautiful
lorna
ever
loving
me
which
he
talked
about
as
patly
though
of
course
i
never
mentioned
her
as
if
it
were
a
settled
thing
and
he
knew
all
about
it
that
mere
idea
so
drove
me
abroad
that
if
he
had
asked
three
times
as
much
i
could
never
have
counted
the
money
now
in
all
this
i
was
a
fool
of
coursenot
for
remembering
my
friends
and
neighbours
which
a
man
has
a
right
to
do
and
indeed
is
bound
to
do
when
he
comes
from
londonbut
for
not
being
certified
first
what
cash
i
had
to
go
on
with
and
to
my
great
amazement
when
i
went
with
another
bill
for
the
victuals
of
only
three
days
more
and
a
weeks
expense
on
the
homeward
road
reckoned
very
narrowly
master
spank
not
only
refused
to
grant
me
any
interview
but
sent
me
out
a
piece
of
blue
paper
looking
like
a
butchers
ticket
and
bearing
these
words
and
no
more
john
ridd
go
to
the
devil
he
who
will
not
when
he
may
when
he
will
he
shall
have
nay
from
this
i
concluded
that
i
had
lost
favour
in
the
sight
of
chief
justice
jeffreys
perhaps
because
my
evidence
had
not
proved
of
any
value
perhaps
because
he
meant
to
let
the
matter
lie
till
cast
on
him
anyhow
it
was
a
reason
of
much
grief
and
some
anger
to
me
and
very
great
anxiety
disappointment
and
suspense
for
here
was
the
time
of
the
hay
gone
past
and
the
harvest
of
small
corn
coming
on
and
the
trout
now
rising
at
the
yellow
sally
and
the
blackbirds
eating
our
whiteheart
cherries
i
was
sure
though
i
could
not
see
them
and
who
was
to
do
any
good
for
mother
or
stop
her
from
weeping
continually
and
more
than
this
what
was
become
of
lorna
perhaps
she
had
cast
me
away
altogether
as
a
flouter
and
a
changeling
perhaps
she
had
drowned
herself
in
the
black
well
perhaps
and
that
was
worst
of
all
she
was
even
married
child
as
she
was
to
that
vile
carver
doone
if
the
doones
ever
cared
about
marrying
that
last
thought
sent
me
down
at
once
to
watch
for
mr
spank
again
resolved
that
if
i
could
catch
him
spank
him
i
would
to
a
pretty
good
tune
although
sixteen
in
family
however
there
was
no
such
thing
as
to
find
him
and
the
usher
vowed
having
orders
i
doubt
that
he
was
gone
to
the
sea
for
the
good
of
his
health
having
sadly
overworked
himself
and
that
none
but
a
poor
devil
like
himself
who
never
had
handling
of
money
would
stay
in
london
this
foul
hot
weather
which
was
likely
to
bring
the
plague
with
it
here
was
another
new
terror
for
me
who
had
heard
of
the
plagues
of
london
and
the
horrible
things
that
happened
and
so
going
back
to
my
lodgings
at
once
i
opened
my
clothes
and
sought
for
spots
especially
as
being
so
long
at
a
hairy
fellmongers
but
finding
none
i
fell
down
and
thanked
god
for
that
same
and
vowed
to
start
for
oare
tomorrow
with
my
carbine
loaded
come
weal
come
woe
come
sun
come
shower
though
all
the
parish
should
laugh
at
me
for
begging
my
way
home
again
after
the
brave
things
said
of
my
going
as
if
i
had
been
the
kings
cousin
but
i
was
saved
in
some
degree
from
this
lowering
of
my
pride
and
what
mattered
more
of
mothers
for
going
to
buy
with
my
last
crownpiece
after
all
demands
were
paid
a
little
shot
and
powder
more
needful
on
the
road
almost
than
even
shoes
or
victuals
at
the
corner
of
the
street
i
met
my
good
friend
jeremy
stickles
newly
come
in
search
of
me
i
took
him
back
to
my
little
roommine
at
least
till
tomorrow
morningand
told
him
all
my
story
and
how
much
i
felt
aggrieved
by
it
but
he
surprised
me
very
much
by
showing
no
surprise
at
all
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
jack
they
have
gotten
all
they
can
from
thee
and
why
should
they
feed
thee
further
we
feed
not
a
dead
pig
i
trow
but
baste
him
well
with
brine
and
rue
nay
we
do
not
victual
him
upon
the
day
of
killing
which
they
have
done
to
thee
thou
art
a
lucky
man
john
thou
hast
gotten
one
days
wages
or
at
any
rate
half
a
day
after
thy
work
was
rendered
god
have
mercy
on
me
john
the
things
i
see
are
manifold
and
so
is
my
regard
of
them
what
use
to
insist
on
this
or
make
a
special
point
of
that
or
hold
by
something
said
of
old
when
a
different
mood
was
on
i
tell
thee
jack
all
men
are
liars
and
he
is
the
least
one
who
presses
not
too
hard
on
them
for
lying
this
was
all
quite
dark
to
me
for
i
never
looked
at
things
like
that
and
never
would
own
myself
a
liar
not
at
least
to
other
people
nor
even
to
myself
although
i
might
to
god
sometimes
when
trouble
was
upon
me
and
if
it
comes
to
that
no
man
has
any
right
to
be
called
a
liar
for
smoothing
over
things
unwitting
through
duty
to
his
neighbour
five
pounds
thou
shalt
have
jack
said
jeremy
stickles
suddenly
while
i
was
all
abroad
with
myself
as
to
being
a
liar
or
not
five
pounds
and
i
will
take
my
chance
of
wringing
it
from
that
great
rogue
spank
ten
i
would
have
made
it
john
but
for
bad
luck
lately
put
back
your
bits
of
paper
lad
i
will
have
no
acknowledgment
john
ridd
no
nonsense
with
me
for
i
was
ready
to
kiss
his
hand
to
think
that
any
man
in
london
the
meanest
and
most
suspicious
place
upon
all
gods
earth
should
trust
me
with
five
pounds
without
even
a
receipt
for
it
it
overcame
me
so
that
i
sobbed
for
after
all
though
big
in
body
i
am
but
a
child
at
heart
it
was
not
the
five
pounds
that
moved
me
but
the
way
of
giving
it
and
after
so
much
bitter
talk
the
great
trust
in
my
goodness
chapter
xxvii
home
again
at
last
it
was
the
beginning
of
wheatharvest
when
i
came
to
dunster
town
having
walked
all
the
way
from
london
and
being
somewhat
footsore
for
though
five
pounds
was
enough
to
keep
me
in
food
and
lodging
upon
the
road
and
leave
me
many
a
shilling
to
give
to
far
poorer
travellers
it
would
have
been
nothing
for
horsehire
as
i
knew
too
well
by
the
prices
jeremy
stickles
had
paid
upon
our
way
to
london
now
i
never
saw
a
prettier
town
than
dunster
looked
that
evening
for
sooth
to
say
i
had
almost
lost
all
hope
of
reaching
it
that
night
although
the
castle
was
long
in
view
but
being
once
there
my
troubles
were
gone
at
least
as
regarded
wayfaring
for
mothers
cousin
the
worthy
tanner
with
whom
we
had
slept
on
the
way
to
london
was
in
such
indignation
at
the
plight
in
which
i
came
back
to
him
afoot
and
weary
and
almost
shoelessnot
to
speak
of
upper
thingsthat
he
swore
then
by
the
mercy
of
god
that
if
the
schemes
abrewing
round
him
against
those
bloody
papists
should
come
to
any
head
or
shape
and
show
good
chance
of
succeeding
he
would
risk
a
thousand
pounds
as
though
it
were
a
penny
i
told
him
not
to
do
it
because
i
had
heard
otherwise
but
was
not
at
liberty
to
tell
onetenth
of
what
i
knew
and
indeed
had
seen
in
london
town
but
of
this
he
took
no
heed
because
i
only
nodded
at
him
and
he
could
not
make
it
out
for
it
takes
an
old
man
or
at
least
a
middleaged
one
to
nod
and
wink
with
any
power
on
the
brains
of
other
men
however
i
think
i
made
him
know
that
the
bad
state
in
which
i
came
to
his
town
and
the
great
shame
i
had
wrought
for
him
among
the
folk
round
the
cardtable
at
the
luttrell
arms
was
not
to
be
even
there
attributed
to
king
charles
the
second
nor
even
to
his
counsellors
but
to
my
own
speed
of
travelling
which
had
beat
posthorses
for
being
much
distraught
in
mind
and
desperate
in
body
i
had
made
all
the
way
from
london
to
dunster
in
six
days
and
no
more
it
may
be
one
hundred
and
seventy
miles
i
cannot
tell
to
a
furlong
or
two
especially
as
i
lost
my
way
more
than
a
dozen
times
but
at
any
rate
there
in
six
days
i
was
and
most
kindly
they
received
me
the
tanner
had
some
excellent
daughters
i
forget
how
many
very
pretty
damsels
and
well
set
up
and
able
to
make
good
pastry
but
though
they
asked
me
many
questions
and
made
a
sort
of
lord
of
me
and
offered
to
darn
my
stockings
which
in
truth
required
it
i
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
them
although
i
would
not
acknowledge
it
and
they
said
poor
cousin
he
is
weary
and
led
me
to
a
blessed
bed
and
kissed
me
all
round
like
swans
down
in
the
morning
all
the
exmoor
hills
the
thought
of
which
had
frightened
me
at
the
end
of
each
days
travel
seemed
no
more
than
bushels
to
me
as
i
looked
forth
the
bedroom
window
and
thanked
god
for
the
sight
of
them
and
even
so
i
had
not
to
climb
them
at
least
by
my
own
labour
for
my
most
worthy
uncle
as
we
oft
call
a
parents
cousin
finding
it
impossible
to
keep
me
for
the
day
and
owning
indeed
that
i
was
right
in
hastening
to
my
mother
vowed
that
walk
i
should
not
even
though
he
lost
his
saturday
hides
from
minehead
and
from
watchett
accordingly
he
sent
me
forth
on
the
very
strongest
nag
he
had
and
the
maidens
came
to
wish
me
godspeed
and
kissed
their
hands
at
the
doorway
it
made
me
proud
and
glad
to
think
that
after
seeing
so
much
of
the
world
and
having
held
my
own
with
it
i
was
come
once
more
among
my
own
people
and
found
them
kinder
and
more
warmhearted
ay
and
better
looking
too
than
almost
any
i
had
happened
upon
in
the
mighty
city
of
london
but
how
shall
i
tell
you
the
things
i
felt
and
the
swelling
of
my
heart
within
me
as
i
drew
nearer
and
more
near
to
the
place
of
all
i
loved
and
owned
to
the
haunt
of
every
warm
remembrance
the
nest
of
all
the
fledgling
hopesin
a
word
to
home
the
first
sheep
i
beheld
on
the
moor
with
a
great
red
jr
on
his
side
for
mother
would
have
them
marked
with
my
name
instead
of
her
own
as
they
should
have
been
i
do
assure
you
my
spirit
leaped
and
all
my
sight
came
to
my
eyes
i
shouted
out
jem
boyfor
that
was
his
name
and
a
rare
hand
he
was
at
fightingand
he
knew
me
in
spite
of
the
stranger
horse
and
i
leaned
over
and
stroked
his
head
and
swore
he
should
never
be
mutton
and
when
i
was
passed
he
set
off
at
full
gallop
to
call
the
rest
of
the
jrs
together
and
tell
them
young
master
was
come
home
at
last
but
bless
your
heart
and
my
own
as
well
it
would
take
me
all
the
afternoon
to
lay
before
you
onetenth
of
the
things
which
came
home
to
me
in
that
one
halfhour
as
the
sun
was
sinking
in
the
real
way
he
ought
to
sink
i
touched
my
horse
with
no
spur
nor
whip
feeling
that
my
slow
wits
would
go
if
the
sights
came
too
fast
over
them
here
was
the
pool
where
we
washed
the
sheep
and
there
was
the
hollow
that
oozed
away
where
i
had
shot
three
wild
ducks
here
was
the
peatrick
that
hid
my
dinner
when
i
could
not
go
home
for
it
and
there
was
the
bush
with
the
thyme
growing
round
it
where
annie
had
found
a
great
swarm
of
our
bees
and
now
was
the
corner
of
the
dry
stone
wall
where
the
moor
gave
over
in
earnest
and
the
partridges
whisked
from
it
into
the
corn
lands
and
called
that
their
supper
was
ready
and
looked
at
our
house
and
the
ricks
as
they
ran
and
would
wait
for
that
comfort
till
winter
and
there
i
sawbut
let
me
goannie
was
too
much
for
me
she
nearly
pulled
me
off
my
horse
and
kissed
the
very
mouth
of
the
carbine
i
knew
you
would
come
oh
john
oh
john
i
have
waited
here
every
saturday
night
and
i
saw
you
for
the
last
mile
or
more
but
i
would
not
come
round
the
corner
for
fear
that
i
should
cry
john
and
then
not
cry
when
i
got
you
now
i
may
cry
as
much
as
i
like
and
you
need
not
try
to
stop
me
john
because
i
am
so
happy
but
you
mustnt
cry
yourself
john
what
will
mother
think
of
you
she
will
be
so
jealous
of
me
what
mother
thought
i
cannot
tell
and
indeed
i
doubt
if
she
thought
at
all
for
more
than
half
an
hour
but
only
managed
to
hold
me
tight
and
cry
and
thank
god
now
and
then
but
with
some
fear
of
his
taking
me
if
she
should
be
too
grateful
moreover
she
thought
it
was
my
own
doing
and
i
ought
to
have
the
credit
of
it
and
she
even
came
down
very
sharply
upon
johns
wife
mrs
fry
for
saying
that
we
must
not
be
too
proud
for
all
of
it
was
the
lords
doing
however
dear
mother
was
ashamed
of
that
afterwards
and
asked
mrs
frys
humble
pardon
and
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
it
old
smiler
had
told
them
that
i
was
comingall
the
rest
i
mean
except
anniefor
having
escaped
from
his
halterring
he
was
come
out
to
graze
in
the
lane
a
bit
when
what
should
he
see
but
a
strange
horse
coming
with
young
master
and
mistress
upon
him
for
annie
must
needs
get
up
behind
me
there
being
only
sheep
to
look
at
her
then
smiler
gave
us
a
stare
and
a
neigh
with
his
tail
quite
stiff
with
amazement
and
then
whether
in
joy
or
through
indignation
he
flung
up
his
hind
feet
and
galloped
straight
home
and
set
every
dog
wild
with
barking
now
methinks
quite
enough
has
been
said
concerning
this
mighty
return
of
the
young
john
ridd
which
was
known
up
at
cosgate
that
evening
and
feeling
that
i
cannot
describe
it
how
can
i
hope
that
any
one
else
will
labour
to
imagine
it
even
of
the
few
who
are
able
for
very
few
can
have
travelled
so
far
unless
indeed
they
whose
trade
it
is
or
very
unsettled
people
and
even
of
those
who
have
done
so
not
one
in
a
hundred
can
have
such
a
home
as
i
had
to
come
home
to
mother
wept
again
with
grief
and
some
wrath
and
so
did
annie
also
and
even
little
eliza
and
all
were
unsettled
in
loyalty
and
talked
about
a
republic
when
i
told
them
how
i
had
been
left
without
money
for
travelling
homeward
and
expected
to
have
to
beg
my
way
which
farmer
snowe
would
have
heard
of
and
though
i
could
see
they
were
disappointed
at
my
failure
of
any
promotion
they
all
declared
how
glad
they
were
and
how
much
better
they
liked
me
to
be
no
more
than
what
they
were
accustomed
to
at
least
my
mother
and
annie
said
so
without
waiting
to
hear
any
more
but
lizzie
did
not
answer
to
it
until
i
had
opened
my
bag
and
shown
the
beautiful
present
i
had
for
her
and
then
she
kissed
me
almost
like
annie
and
vowed
that
she
thought
very
little
of
captains
for
lizzies
present
was
the
best
of
all
i
mean
of
course
except
lornas
which
i
carried
in
my
breast
all
the
way
hoping
that
it
might
make
her
love
me
from
having
lain
so
long
close
to
my
heart
for
i
had
brought
lizzie
something
dear
and
a
precious
heavy
book
it
was
and
much
beyond
my
understanding
whereas
i
knew
well
that
to
both
the
others
my
gifts
would
be
dear
for
mine
own
sake
and
happier
people
could
not
be
found
than
the
whole
of
us
were
that
evening

to
know
more
about
lorna
and
though
all
my
heart
was
yearning
i
could
not
reconcile
it
yet
with
my
duty
to
mother
and
annie
to
leave
them
on
the
following
day
which
happened
to
be
a
sunday
for
lo
before
breakfast
was
out
of
our
mouths
there
came
all
the
men
of
the
farm
and
their
wives
and
even
the
two
crowboys
dressed
as
if
going
to
barnstaple
fair
to
inquire
how
master
john
was
and
whether
it
was
true
that
the
king
had
made
him
one
of
his
bodyguard
and
if
so
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
belt
for
the
championship
of
the
westcounties
wrestling
which
i
had
held
now
for
a
year
or
more
and
none
were
ready
to
challenge
it
strange
to
say
this
last
point
seemed
the
most
important
of
all
to
them
and
none
asked
who
was
to
manage
the
farm
or
answer
for
their
wages
but
all
asked
who
was
to
wear
the
belt
to
this
i
replied
after
shaking
hands
twice
over
all
round
with
all
of
them
that
i
meant
to
wear
the
belt
myself
for
the
honour
of
oare
parish
so
long
as
ever
god
gave
me
strength
and
health
to
meet
allcomers
for
i
had
never
been
asked
to
be
bodyguard
and
if
asked
i
would
never
have
done
it
some
of
them
cried
that
the
king
must
be
mazed
not
to
keep
me
for
his
protection
in
these
violent
times
of
popery
i
could
have
told
them
that
the
king
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
papists
but
on
the
contrary
very
fond
of
them
however
i
held
my
tongue
remembering
what
judge
jeffreys
bade
me
in
church
the
whole
congregation
man
woman
and
child
except
indeed
the
snowe
girls
who
only
looked
when
i
was
not
watching
turned
on
me
with
one
accord
and
stared
so
steadfastly
to
get
some
reflection
of
the
king
from
me
that
they
forgot
the
time
to
kneel
down
and
the
parson
was
forced
to
speak
to
them
if
i
coughed
or
moved
my
book
or
bowed
or
even
said
amen
glances
were
exchanged
which
meantthat
he
hath
learned
in
london
town
and
most
likely
from
his
majesty
however
all
this
went
off
in
time
and
people
became
even
angry
with
me
for
not
being
sharper
as
they
said
or
smarter
or
a
whit
more
fashionable
for
all
the
great
company
i
had
seen
and
all
the
wondrous
things
wasted
upon
me
but
though
i
may
have
been
none
the
wiser
by
reason
of
my
stay
in
london
at
any
rate
i
was
much
the
better
in
virtue
of
coming
home
again
for
now
i
had
learned
the
joy
of
quiet
and
the
gratitude
for
good
things
round
us
and
the
love
we
owe
to
others
even
those
who
must
be
kind
for
their
indulgence
to
us
all
this
before
my
journey
had
been
too
much
as
a
matter
of
course
to
me
but
having
missed
it
now
i
knew
that
it
was
a
gift
and
might
be
lost
moreover
i
had
pined
so
much
in
the
dust
and
heat
of
that
great
town
for
trees
and
fields
and
running
waters
and
the
sounds
of
country
life
and
the
air
of
country
winds
that
never
more
could
i
grow
weary
of
those
soft
enjoyments
or
at
least
i
thought
so
then
to
awake
as
the
summer
sun
came
slanting
over
the
hilltops
with
hope
on
every
beam
adance
to
the
laughter
of
the
morning
to
see
the
leaves
across
the
window
ruffling
on
the
fresh
new
air
and
the
tendrils
of
the
powdery
vine
turning
from
their
beaded
sleep
then
the
lustrous
meadows
far
beyond
the
thatch
of
the
gardenwall
yet
seen
beneath
the
hanging
scollops
of
the
walnuttree
all
awaking
dressed
in
pearl
all
amazed
at
their
own
glistening
like
a
maid
at
her
own
ideas
down
them
troop
the
lowing
kine
walking
each
with
a
step
of
character
even
as
men
and
women
do
yet
all
alike
with
toss
of
horns
and
spread
of
udders
ready
from
them
without
a
word
we
turn
to
the
farmyard
proper
seen
on
the
right
and
dryly
strawed
from
the
petty
rush
of
the
pitchpaved
runnel
round
it
stand
the
snug
outbuildings
barn
cornchamber
ciderpress
stables
with
a
blinkerd
horse
in
every
doorway
munching
while
his
driver
tightens
buckles
whistles
and
looks
down
the
lane
dallying
to
begin
his
labour
till
the
milkmaids
be
gone
by
here
the
cock
comes
forth
at
lastwhere
has
he
been
lingeringeggs
may
tell
tomorrowhe
claps
his
wings
and
shouts
cockadoodle
and
no
other
cock
dare
look
at
him
two
or
three
go
sidling
off
waiting
till
their
spurs
be
grown
and
then
the
crowd
of
partlets
comes
chattering
how
their
lord
has
dreamed
and
crowed
at
two
in
the
morning
and
praying
that
the
old
brown
rat
would
only
dare
to
face
him
but
while
the
cock
is
crowing
still
and
the
pullet
world
admiring
him
who
comes
up
but
the
old
turkeycock
with
all
his
family
round
him
then
the
geese
at
the
lower
end
begin
to
thrust
their
breasts
out
and
mum
their
downbits
and
look
at
the
gander
and
scream
shrill
joy
for
the
conflict
while
the
ducks
in
pond
show
nothing
but
tail
in
proof
of
their
strict
neutrality
while
yet
we
dread
for
the
coming
event
and
the
fight
which
would
jar
on
the
morning
behold
the
grandmother
of
sows
gruffly
grunting
right
and
left
with
muzzle
which
no
ring
may
tame
not
being
matrimonial
hulks
across
between
the
two
moving
all
each
side
at
once
and
then
all
of
the
other
side
as
if
she
were
chined
down
the
middle
and
afraid
of
spilling
the
salt
from
her
as
this
mighty
view
of
lard
hides
each
combatant
from
the
other
gladly
each
retires
and
boasts
how
he
would
have
slain
his
neighbour
but
that
old
sow
drove
the
other
away
and
no
wonder
he
was
afraid
of
her
after
all
the
chicks
she
had
eaten
and
so
it
goes
on
and
so
the
sun
comes
stronger
from
his
drink
of
dew
and
the
cattle
in
the
byres
and
the
horses
from
the
stable
and
the
men
from
cottagedoor
each
has
had
his
rest
and
food
all
smell
alike
of
hay
and
straw
and
every
one
must
hie
to
work
be
it
drag
or
draw
or
delve
so
thought
i
on
the
monday
morning
while
my
own
work
lay
before
me
and
i
was
plotting
how
to
quit
it
void
of
harm
to
every
one
and
let
my
love
have
work
a
littlehardest
perhaps
of
all
work
and
yet
as
sure
as
sunrise
i
knew
that
my
first
days
task
on
the
farm
would
be
strictly
watched
by
every
one
even
by
my
gentle
mother
to
see
what
i
had
learned
in
london
but
could
i
let
still
another
day
pass
for
lorna
to
think
me
faithless
i
felt
much
inclined
to
tell
dear
mother
all
about
lorna
and
how
i
loved
her
yet
had
no
hope
of
winning
her
often
and
often
i
had
longed
to
do
this
and
have
done
with
it
but
the
thought
of
my
fathers
terrible
death
at
the
hands
of
the
doones
prevented
me
and
it
seemed
to
me
foolish
and
mean
to
grieve
mother
without
any
chance
of
my
suit
ever
speeding
if
once
lorna
loved
me
my
mother
should
know
it
and
it
would
be
the
greatest
happiness
to
me
to
have
no
concealment
from
her
though
at
first
she
was
sure
to
grieve
terribly
but
i
saw
no
more
chance
of
lorna
loving
me
than
of
the
man
in
the
moon
coming
down
or
rather
of
the
moon
coming
down
to
the
man
as
related
in
old
mythology
now
the
merriment
of
the
small
birds
and
the
clear
voice
of
the
waters
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
in
meadows
and
the
view
of
no
houses
except
just
our
own
and
a
neighbours
and
the
knowledge
of
everybody
around
their
kindness
of
heart
and
simplicity
and
love
of
their
neighbours
doingsall
these
could
not
help
or
please
me
at
all
and
many
of
them
were
much
against
me
in
my
secret
depth
of
longing
and
dark
tumult
of
the
mind
many
people
may
think
me
foolish
especially
after
coming
from
london
where
many
nice
maids
looked
at
me
on
account
of
my
bulk
and
stature
and
i
might
have
been
fitted
up
with
a
sweetheart
in
spite
of
my
westcountry
twang
and
the
smallness
of
my
purse
if
only
i
had
said
the
word
but
nay
i
have
contempt
for
a
man
whose
heart
is
like
a
shirtstud
such
as
i
saw
in
london
cards
fitted
into
one
today
sitting
bravely
on
the
breast
plucked
out
on
the
morrow
morn
and
the
place
that
knew
it
gone
now
what
did
i
do
but
take
my
chance
reckless
whether
any
one
heeded
me
or
not
only
craving
lornas
heed
and
time
for
ten
words
to
her
therefore
i
left
the
men
of
the
farm
as
far
away
as
might
be
after
making
them
work
with
me
which
no
man
round
our
parts
could
do
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
then
knowing
them
to
be
well
weary
very
unlike
to
follow
meand
still
more
unlike
to
tell
of
me
for
each
had
his
london
presenti
strode
right
away
in
good
trust
of
my
speed
without
any
more
misgivings
but
resolved
to
face
the
worst
of
it
and
to
try
to
be
home
for
supper
and
first
i
went
i
know
not
why
to
the
crest
of
the
broken
highland
whence
i
had
agreed
to
watch
for
any
mark
or
signal
and
sure
enough
at
last
i
saw
when
it
was
too
late
to
see
that
the
white
stone
had
been
covered
over
with
a
cloth
or
mantlethe
sign
that
something
had
arisen
to
make
lorna
want
me
for
a
moment
i
stood
amazed
at
my
evil
fortune
that
i
should
be
too
late
in
the
very
thing
of
all
things
on
which
my
heart
was
set
then
after
eyeing
sorrowfully
every
crick
and
cranny
to
be
sure
that
not
a
single
flutter
of
my
love
was
visible
off
i
set
with
small
respect
either
for
my
knees
or
neck
to
make
the
round
of
the
outer
cliffs
and
come
up
my
old
access
nothing
could
stop
me
it
was
not
long
although
to
me
it
seemed
an
age
before
i
stood
in
the
niche
of
rock
at
the
head
of
the
slippery
watercourse
and
gazed
into
the
quiet
glen
where
my
foolish
heart
was
dwelling
notwithstanding
doubts
of
right
notwithstanding
sense
of
duty
and
despite
all
manly
striving
and
the
great
love
of
my
home
there
my
heart
was
ever
dwelling
knowing
what
a
fool
it
was
and
content
to
know
it
many
birds
came
twittering
round
me
in
the
gold
of
august
many
trees
showed
twinkling
beauty
as
the
sun
went
lower
and
the
lines
of
water
fell
from
wrinkles
into
dimples
little
heeding
there
i
crouched
though
with
sense
of
everything
that
afterwards
should
move
me
like
a
picture
or
a
dream
and
everything
went
by
me
softly
while
my
heart
was
gazing
at
last
a
little
figure
came
not
insignificant
i
mean
but
looking
very
light
and
slender
in
the
moving
shadows
gently
here
and
softly
there
as
if
vague
of
purpose
with
a
gloss
of
tender
movement
in
and
out
the
wealth
of
trees
and
liberty
of
the
meadow
who
was
i
to
crouch
or
doubt
or
look
at
her
from
a
distance
what
matter
if
they
killed
me
now
and
one
tear
came
to
bury
me
therefore
i
rushed
out
at
once
as
if
shotguns
were
unknown
yet
not
from
any
real
courage
but
from
prisoned
love
burst
forth
i
know
not
whether
my
own
lorna
was
afraid
of
what
i
looked
or
what
i
might
say
to
her
or
of
her
own
thoughts
of
me
all
i
know
is
that
she
looked
frightened
when
i
hoped
for
gladness
perhaps
the
power
of
my
joy
was
more
than
maiden
liked
to
own
or
in
any
way
to
answer
to
and
to
tell
the
truth
it
seemed
as
if
i
might
now
forget
myself
while
she
would
take
good
care
of
it
this
makes
a
man
grow
thoughtful
unless
as
some
low
fellows
do
he
believe
all
women
hypocrites
therefore
i
went
slowly
towards
her
taken
back
in
my
impulse
and
said
all
i
could
come
to
say
with
some
distress
in
doing
it
mistress
lorna
i
had
hope
that
you
were
in
need
of
me
oh
yes
but
that
was
long
ago
two
months
ago
or
more
sir
and
saying
this
she
looked
away
as
if
it
all
were
over
but
i
was
now
so
dazed
and
frightened
that
it
took
my
breath
away
and
i
could
not
answer
feeling
sure
that
i
was
robbed
and
some
one
else
had
won
her
and
i
tried
to
turn
away
without
another
word
and
go
but
i
could
not
help
one
stupid
sob
though
mad
with
myself
for
allowing
it
but
it
came
too
sharp
for
pride
to
stay
it
and
it
told
a
world
of
things
lorna
heard
it
and
ran
to
me
with
her
bright
eyes
full
of
wonder
pity
and
great
kindness
as
if
amazed
that
i
had
more
than
a
simple
liking
for
her
then
she
held
out
both
hands
to
me
and
i
took
and
looked
at
them
master
ridd
i
did
not
mean
she
whispered
very
softly
i
did
not
mean
to
vex
you
if
you
would
be
loath
to
vex
me
none
else
in
this
world
can
do
it
i
answered
out
of
my
great
love
but
fearing
yet
to
look
at
her
mine
eyes
not
being
strong
enough
come
away
from
this
bright
place
she
answered
trembling
in
her
turn
i
am
watched
and
spied
of
late
come
beneath
the
shadows
john
i
would
have
leaped
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
as
described
by
the
late
john
bunyan
only
to
hear
her
call
me
john
though
apollyon
were
lurking
there
and
despair
should
lock
me
in
she
stole
across
the
silent
grass
but
i
strode
hotly
after
her
fear
was
all
beyond
me
now
except
the
fear
of
losing
her
i
could
not
but
behold
her
manner
as
she
went
before
me
all
her
grace
and
lovely
sweetness
and
her
sense
of
what
she
was
she
led
me
to
her
own
rich
bower
which
i
told
of
once
before
and
if
in
spring
it
were
a
sight
what
was
it
in
summer
glory
but
although
my
mind
had
notice
of
its
fairness
and
its
wonder
not
a
heed
my
heart
took
of
it
neither
dwelt
it
in
my
presence
more
than
flowing
water
all
that
in
my
presence
dwelt
all
that
in
my
heart
was
felt
was
the
maiden
moving
gently
and
afraid
to
look
at
me
for
now
the
power
of
my
love
was
abiding
on
her
new
to
her
unknown
to
her
not
a
thing
to
speak
about
nor
even
to
think
clearly
only
just
to
feel
and
wonder
with
a
pain
of
sweetness
she
could
look
at
me
no
more
neither
could
she
look
away
with
a
studied
manneronly
to
let
fall
her
eyes
and
blush
and
be
put
out
with
me
and
still
more
with
herself
i
left
her
quite
alone
though
close
though
tingling
to
have
hold
of
her
even
her
right
hand
was
dropped
and
lay
among
the
mosses
neither
did
i
try
to
steal
one
glimpse
below
her
eyelids
life
and
death
to
me
were
hanging
on
the
first
glance
i
should
win
yet
i
let
it
be
so
after
long
or
shorti
know
not
yet
ere
i
was
weary
ere
i
yet
began
to
think
or
wish
for
any
answerlorna
slowly
raised
her
eyelids
with
a
gleam
of
dew
below
them
and
looked
at
me
doubtfully
any
look
with
so
much
in
it
never
met
my
gaze
before
darling
do
you
love
me
was
all
that
i
could
say
to
her
yes
i
like
you
very
much
she
answered
with
her
eyes
gone
from
me
and
her
dark
hair
falling
over
so
as
not
to
show
me
things
but
do
you
love
me
lorna
lorna
do
you
love
me
more
than
all
the
world
no
to
be
sure
not
now
why
should
i
in
truth
i
know
not
why
you
should
only
i
hoped
that
you
did
lorna
either
love
me
not
at
all
or
as
i
love
you
for
ever
john
i
love
you
very
much
and
i
would
not
grieve
you
you
are
the
bravest
and
the
kindest
and
the
simplest
of
all
meni
mean
of
all
peoplei
like
you
very
much
master
ridd
and
i
think
of
you
almost
every
day
that
will
not
do
for
me
lorna
not
almost
every
day
i
think
but
every
instant
of
my
life
of
you
for
you
i
would
give
up
my
home
my
love
of
all
the
world
beside
my
duty
to
my
dearest
ones
for
you
i
would
give
up
my
life
and
hope
of
life
beyond
it
do
you
love
me
so
not
by
any
means
said
lorna
no
i
like
you
very
much
when
you
do
not
talk
so
wildly
and
i
like
to
see
you
come
as
if
you
would
fill
our
valley
up
and
i
like
to
think
that
even
carver
would
be
nothing
in
your
handsbut
as
to
liking
you
like
that
what
should
make
it
likely
especially
when
i
have
made
the
signal
and
for
some
two
months
or
more
you
have
never
even
answered
it
if
you
like
me
so
ferociously
why
do
you
leave
me
for
other
people
to
do
just
as
they
like
with
me
to
do
as
they
liked
oh
lorna
not
to
make
you
marry
carver
no
master
ridd
be
not
frightened
so
it
makes
me
fear
to
look
at
you
but
you
have
not
married
carver
yet
say
quick
why
keep
me
waiting
so
of
course
i
have
not
master
ridd
should
i
be
here
if
i
had
think
you
and
allowing
you
to
like
me
so
and
to
hold
my
hand
and
make
me
laugh
as
i
declare
you
almost
do
sometimes
and
at
other
times
you
frighten
me
did
they
want
you
to
marry
carver
tell
me
all
the
truth
of
it
not
yet
not
yet
they
are
not
half
so
impetuous
as
you
are
john
i
am
only
just
seventeen
you
know
and
who
is
to
think
of
marrying
but
they
wanted
me
to
give
my
word
and
be
formally
betrothed
to
him
in
the
presence
of
my
grandfather
it
seems
that
something
frightened
them
there
is
a
youth
named
charleworth
doone
every
one
calls
him
charlie
a
headstrong
and
a
gay
young
man
very
gallant
in
his
looks
and
manner
and
my
uncle
the
counsellor
chose
to
fancy
that
charlie
looked
at
me
too
much
coming
by
my
grandfathers
cottage
here
lorna
blushed
so
that
i
was
frightened
and
began
to
hate
this
charlie
more
a
great
deal
more
than
even
carver
doone
he
had
better
not
said
i
i
will
fling
him
over
it
if
he
dare
he
shall
see
thee
through
the
roof
lorna
if
at
all
he
see
thee
master
ridd
you
are
worse
than
carver
i
thought
you
were
so
kindhearted
well
they
wanted
me
to
promise
and
even
to
swear
a
solemn
oath
a
thing
i
have
never
done
in
my
life
that
i
would
wed
my
eldest
cousin
this
same
carver
doone
who
is
twice
as
old
as
i
am
being
thirtyfive
and
upwards
that
was
why
i
gave
the
token
that
i
wished
to
see
you
master
ridd
they
pointed
out
how
much
it
was
for
the
peace
of
all
the
family
and
for
mine
own
benefit
but
i
would
not
listen
for
a
moment
though
the
counsellor
was
most
eloquent
and
my
grandfather
begged
me
to
consider
and
carver
smiled
his
pleasantest
which
is
a
truly
frightful
thing
then
both
he
and
his
crafty
father
were
for
using
force
with
me
but
sir
ensor
would
not
hear
of
it
and
they
have
put
off
that
extreme
until
he
shall
be
past
its
knowledge
or
at
least
beyond
preventing
it
and
now
i
am
watched
and
spied
and
followed
and
half
my
little
liberty
seems
to
be
taken
from
me
i
could
not
be
here
speaking
with
you
even
in
my
own
nook
and
refuge
but
for
the
aid
and
skill
and
courage
of
dear
little
gwenny
carfax
she
is
now
my
chief
reliance
and
through
her
alone
i
hope
to
baffle
all
my
enemies
since
others
have
forsaken
me
tears
of
sorrow
and
reproach
were
lurking
in
her
soft
dark
eyes
until
in
fewest
words
i
told
her
that
my
seeming
negligence
was
nothing
but
my
bitter
loss
and
wretched
absence
far
away
of
which
i
had
so
vainly
striven
to
give
any
tidings
without
danger
to
her
when
she
heard
all
this
and
saw
what
i
had
brought
from
london
which
was
nothing
less
than
a
ring
of
pearls
with
a
sapphire
in
the
midst
of
them
as
pretty
as
could
well
be
found
she
let
the
gentle
tears
flow
fast
and
came
and
sat
so
close
beside
me
that
i
trembled
like
a
folded
sheep
at
the
bleating
of
her
lamb
but
recovering
comfort
quickly
without
more
ado
i
raised
her
left
hand
and
observed
it
with
a
nice
regard
wondering
at
the
small
blue
veins
and
curves
and
tapering
whiteness
and
the
points
it
finished
with
my
wonder
seemed
to
please
her
much
herself
so
well
accustomed
to
it
and
not
fond
of
watching
it
and
then
before
she
could
say
a
word
or
guess
what
i
was
up
to
as
quick
as
ever
i
turned
hand
in
a
bout
of
wrestling
on
her
finger
was
my
ringsapphire
for
the
veins
of
blue
and
pearls
to
match
white
fingers
oh
you
crafty
master
ridd
said
lorna
looking
up
at
me
and
blushing
now
a
far
brighter
blush
than
when
she
spoke
of
charlie
i
thought
that
you
were
much
too
simple
ever
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
no
wonder
you
can
catch
the
fish
as
when
first
i
saw
you
have
i
caught
you
little
fish
or
must
all
my
life
be
spent
in
hopeless
angling
for
you
neither
one
nor
the
other
john
you
have
not
caught
me
yet
altogether
though
i
like
you
dearly
john
and
if
you
will
only
keep
away
i
shall
like
you
more
and
more
as
for
hopeless
angling
johnthat
all
others
shall
have
until
i
tell
you
otherwise
with
the
large
tears
in
her
eyestears
which
seemed
to
me
to
rise
partly
from
her
want
to
love
me
with
the
power
of
my
loveshe
put
her
pure
bright
lips
half
smiling
half
prone
to
reply
to
tears
against
my
forehead
lined
with
trouble
doubt
and
eager
longing
and
then
she
drew
my
ring
from
off
that
snowy
twig
her
finger
and
held
it
out
to
me
and
then
seeing
how
my
face
was
falling
thrice
she
touched
it
with
her
lips
and
sweetly
gave
it
back
to
me
john
i
dare
not
take
it
now
else
i
should
be
cheating
you
i
will
try
to
love
you
dearly
even
as
you
deserve
and
wish
keep
it
for
me
just
till
then
something
tells
me
i
shall
earn
it
in
a
very
little
time
perhaps
you
will
be
sorry
then
sorry
when
it
is
all
too
late
to
be
loved
by
such
as
i
am
what
could
i
do
at
her
mournful
tone
but
kiss
a
thousand
times
the
hand
which
she
put
up
to
warn
me
and
vow
that
i
would
rather
die
with
one
assurance
of
her
love
than
without
it
live
for
ever
with
all
beside
that
the
world
could
give
upon
this
she
looked
so
lovely
with
her
dark
eyelashes
trembling
and
her
soft
eyes
full
of
light
and
the
colour
of
clear
sunrise
mounting
on
her
cheeks
and
brow
that
i
was
forced
to
turn
away
being
overcome
with
beauty
dearest
darling
love
of
my
life
i
whispered
through
her
clouds
of
hair
how
long
must
i
wait
to
know
how
long
must
i
linger
doubting
whether
you
can
ever
stoop
from
your
birth
and
wondrous
beauty
to
a
poor
coarse
hind
like
me
an
ignorant
unlettered
yeoman
i
will
not
have
you
revile
yourself
said
lorna
very
tenderlyjust
as
i
had
meant
to
make
her
you
are
not
rude
and
unlettered
john
you
know
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do
you
have
learned
both
greek
and
latin
as
you
told
me
long
ago
and
you
have
been
at
the
very
best
school
in
the
west
of
england
none
of
us
but
my
grandfather
and
the
counsellor
who
is
a
great
scholar
can
compare
with
you
in
this
and
though
i
have
laughed
at
your
manner
of
speech
i
only
laughed
in
fun
john
i
never
meant
to
vex
you
by
it
nor
knew
that
it
had
done
so
naught
you
say
can
vex
me
dear
i
answered
as
she
leaned
towards
me
in
her
generous
sorrow
unless
you
say
begone
john
ridd
i
love
another
more
than
you
then
i
shall
never
vex
you
john
never
i
mean
by
saying
that
now
john
if
you
please
be
quiet
for
i
was
carried
away
so
much
by
hearing
her
calling
me
john
so
often
and
the
music
of
her
voice
and
the
way
she
bent
toward
me
and
the
shadow
of
soft
weeping
in
the
sunlight
of
her
eyes
that
some
of
my
great
hand
was
creeping
in
a
manner
not
to
be
imagined
and
far
less
explained
toward
the
lithesome
wholesome
curving
underneath
her
mantlefold
and
out
of
sight
and
harm
as
i
thought
not
being
her
front
waist
however
i
was
dashed
with
that
and
pretended
not
to
mean
it
only
to
pluck
some
ladyfern
whose
elegance
did
me
no
good
now
john
said
lorna
being
so
quick
that
not
even
a
lover
could
cheat
her
and

my
confusion
more
intently
than
she
need
have
done

john
ridd
it
is
high
time
for
you
to
go
home
to
your
mother
i
love
your
mother
very
much
from
what
you
have
told
me
about
her
and
i
will
not
have
her
cheated
if
you
truly
love
my
mother
said
i
very
craftily
the
only
way
to
show
it
is
by
truly
loving
me
upon
that
she
laughed
at
me
in
the
sweetest
manner
and
with
such
provoking
ways
and
such
comeandgo
of
glances
and
beginning
of
quick
blushes
which
she
tried
to
laugh
away
that
i
knew
as
well
as
if
she
herself
had
told
me
by
some
knowledge
void
of
reasoning
and
the
surer
for
it
i
knew
quite
well
while
all
my
heart
was
burning
hot
within
me
and
mine
eyes
were
shy
of
hers
and
her
eyes
were
shy
of
mine
for
certain
and
for
ever
this

reaping
leads
to

i
was
under

your

i
bore
for
half
the
time
and
even
for
three
quarters
for
she
was
safe
i
knew
that
daily
by
a
mode
of
signals
wellcontrived
between
us
now
on
the
strength
of
our
experience
i
have
nothing
now
to

john
she
had
said
to
me
as
we
parted
it
is
true
that
i
am
spied
and
watched
but
gwenny
is
too
keen
for
them
while
i
have
my
grandfather
to
prevent
all
violence
and
little
gwenny
to
keep
watch
on
those
who
try

at

the
worst
comes
to

never
in
such

before
therefore
do
not
squeeze
my
hand
john
i
am
safe
without
it
and
you
do
not
know
your
strength
ah
i
knew
my
strength
right
well
hill
and
valley
scarcely
seemed
to
be
step
and
landing
for
me
fiercest
cattle
i
would
play
with
making
them
go
backward
and
afraid
of
hurting
them
like
john
fry
with
his
terrier
even
rooted
trees
seemed
to
me
but
as
sticks
i
could
smite
down
except
for
my
love
of
everything
the
love
of
all
things
was
upon
me
and
a
softness
to
them
all
and
a
sense
of
having
something
even
such
as
they
had
then
the
golden
harvest
came
waving
on
the
broad
hillside
and
nestling
in
the
quiet
nooks
scooped
from
out
the
fringe
of
wood
a
wealth
of
harvest
such
as
never
gladdened
all
our
countryside
since
my
father
ceased
to
reap
and
his
sickle
hung
to
rust
there
had
not
been
a
man
on
exmoor
fit
to
work
that
reapinghook
since
the
time
its
owner
fell
in
the
prime
of
life
and
strength
before
a
sterner
reaper
but
now
i
took
it
from
the
wall
where
mother
proudly
stored
it
while
she
watched
me
hardly
knowing
whether
she
should
smile
or
cry
all
the
parish
was
assembled
in
our
upper
courtyard
for
we
were
to
open
the
harvest
that
year
as
had
been
settled
with
farmer
nicholas
and
with
jasper
kebby
who
held
the
third
or
little
farm
we
started
in
proper
order
therefore
as
our
practice
is
first
the
parson
josiah
bowden
wearing
his
gown
and
cassock
with
the
parish
bible
in
his
hand
and
a
sickle
strapped
behind
him
as
he
strode
along
well
and
stoutly
being
a
man
of
substance
all
our
family
came
next
i
leading
mother
with
one
hand
in
the
other
bearing
my
fathers
hook
and
with
a
loaf
of
our
own
bread
and
a
keg
of
cider
upon
my
back
behind
us
annie
and
lizzie
walked
wearing
wreaths
of
cornflowers
set
out
very
prettily
such
as
mother
would
have
worn
if
she
had
been
a
farmers
wife
instead
of
a
farmers
widow
being
as
she
was
she
had
no
adornment
except
that
her
widows
hood
was
off
and
her
hair
allowed
to
flow
as
if
she
had
been
a
maiden
and
very
rich
bright
hair
it
was
in
spite
of
all
her
troubles
after
us
the
maidens
came
milkmaids
and
the
rest
of
them
with
betty
muxworthy
at
their
head
scolding
even
now
because
they
would
not
walk
fitly
but
they
only
laughed
at
her
and
she
knew
it
was
no
good
to
scold
with
all
the
men
behind
them
then
the
snowes
came
trooping
forward
farmer
nicholas
in
the
middle
walking
as
if
he
would
rather
walk
to
a
wheatfield
of
his
own
yet
content
to
follow
lead
because
he
knew
himself
the
leader
and
signing
every
now
and
then
to
the
people
here
and
there
as
if
i
were
nobody
but
to
see
his
three
great
daughters
strong
and
handsome
wenches
making
upon
either
side
as
if
somebody
would
run
off
with
themthis
was
the
very
thing
that
taught
me
how
to
value
lorna
and
her
pure
simplicity
after
the
snowes
came
jasper
kebby
with
his
wife
newmarried
and
a
very
honest
pair
they
were
upon
only
a
hundred
acres
and
a
right
of
common
after
these
the
men
came
hotly
without
decent
order
trying
to
spy
the
girls
in
front
and
make
good
jokes
about
them
at
which
their
wives
laughed
heartily
being
jealous
when
alone
perhaps
and
after
these
men
and
their
wives
came
all
the
children
toddling
picking
flowers
by
the
way
and
chattering
and
asking
questions
as
the
children
will
there
must
have
been
threescore
of
us
take
one
with
another
and
the
lane
was
full
of
people
when
we
were
come
to
the
big
fieldgate
where
the
first
sickle
was
to
be
parson
bowden
heaved
up
the
rail
with
the
sleeves
of
his
gown
done
green
with
it
and
he
said
that
everybody
might
hear
him
though
his
breath
was
short
in
the
name
of
the
lord
amen
amen
so
be
it
cried
the
clerk
who
was
far
behind
being
only
a
shoemaker
then
parson
bowden
read
some
verses
from
the
parish
bible
telling
us
to
lift
up
our
eyes
and
look
upon
the
fields
already
white
to
harvest
and
then
he
laid
the
bible
down
on
the
square
head
of
the
gatepost
and
despite
his
gown
and
cassock
three
good
swipes
he
cut
off
corn
and
laid
them
right
end
onwards
all
this
time
the
rest
were
huddling
outside
the
gate
and
along
the
lane
not
daring
to
interfere
with
parson
but
whispering
how
well
he
did
it
when
he
had
stowed
the
corn
like
that
mother
entered
leaning
on
me
and
we
both
said
thank
the
lord
for
all
his
mercies
and
these
the
firstfruits
of
his
hand
and
then
the
clerk
gave
out
a
psalm
verse
by
verse
done
very
well
although
he
sneezed
in
the
midst
of
it
from
a
beard
of
wheat
thrust
up
his
nose
by
the
rival
cobbler
at
brendon
and
when
the
psalm
was
sung
so
strongly
that
the
foxgloves
on
the
bank
were
shaking
like
a
chime
of
bells
at
it
parson
took
a
stoop
of
cider
and
we
all
fell
to
at
reaping
of
course
i
mean
the
men
not
women
although
i
know
that
up
the
country
women
are
allowed
to
reap
and
right
well
they
reap
it
keeping
row
for
row
with
men
comely
and
in
due
order
yet
meseems
the
men
must
ill
attend
to
their
own
reapinghooks
in
fear
lest
the
other
cut
themselves
being
the
weaker
vessel
but
in
our
part
women
do
what
seems
their
proper
business
following
well
behind
the
men
out
of
harm
of
the
swinging
hook
and
stooping
with
their
breasts
and
arms
up
they
catch
the
swathes
of
corn
where
the
reapers
cast
them
and
tucking
them
together
tightly
with
a
wisp
laid
under
them
this
they
fetch
around
and
twist
with
a
knee
to
keep
it
close
and
lo
there
is
a
goodly
sheaf
ready
to
set
up
in
stooks
after
these
the
children
come
gathering
each
for
his
little
self
if
the
farmer
be
rightminded
until
each
hath
a
bundle
made
as
big
as
himself
and
longer
and
tumbles
now
and
again
with
it
in
the
deeper
part
of
the
stubble
we
the
men
kept
marching
onwards
down
the
flank
of
the
yellow
wall
with
knees
bent
wide
and
left
arm
bowed
and
right
arm
flashing
steel
each
man
in
his
several
place
keeping
down
the
rig
or
chine
on
the
right
side
of
the
reaper
in
front
and
the
left
of
the
man
that
followed
him
each
making
farther
sweep
and
inroad
into
the
golden
breadth
and
depth
each
casting
leftwards
his
rich
clearance
on
his
foregoers
double
track
so
like
half
a
wedge
of
wildfowl
to
and
fro
we
swept
the
field
and
when
to
either
hedge
we
came
sickles
wanted
whetting
and
throats
required
moistening
and
backs
were
in
need
of
easing
and
every
man
had
much
to
say
and
women
wanted
praising
then
all
returned
to
the
other
end
with
reapinghooks
beneath
our
arms
and
dogs
left
to
mind
jackets
but
now
will
you
believe
me
well
or
will
you
only
laugh
at
me
for
even
in
the
world
of
wheat
when
deep
among
the
varnished
crispness
of
the
jointed
stalks
and
below
the
feathered
yielding
of
the
graceful
heads
even
as
i
gripped
the
swathes
and
swept
the
sickle
round
them
even
as
i
flung
them
by
to
rest
on
brother
stubble
through
the
whirling
yellow
world
and
eagerness
of
reaping
came
the
vision
of
my
love
as
with
downcast
eyes
she
wondered
at
my
power
of
passion
and
then
the
sweet
remembrance
glowed
brighter
than
the
sun
through
wheat
through
my
very
depth
of
heart
of
how
she
raised
those
beaming
eyes
and
ripened
in
my
breast
rich
hope
even
now
i
could
descry
like
high
waves
in
the
distance
the
rounded
heads
and
folded
shadows
of
the
wood
of
bagworthy
perhaps
she
was
walking
in
the
valley
and
softly
gazing
up
at
them
oh
to
be
a
bird
just
there
i
could
see
a
bright
mist
hanging
just
above
the
doone
glen
perhaps
it
was
shedding
its
drizzle
upon
her
oh
to
be
a
drop
of
rain
the
very
breeze
which
bowed
the
harvest
to
my
bosom
gently
might
have
come
direct
from
lorna
with
her
sweet
voice
laden
ah
the
flaws
of
air
that
wander
where
they
will
around
her
fan
her
bright
cheek
play
with
lashes
even
revel
in
her
hair
and
reveal
her
beautiesman
is
but
a
breath
we
know
would
i
were
such
breath
as
that
but
confound
it
while
i
ponder
with
delicious
dreams
suspended
with
my
right
arm
hanging
frustrate
and
the
giant
sickle
drooped
with
my
left
arm
bowed
for
clasping
something
more
germane
than
wheat
and
my
eyes
not
minding
business
but
intent
on
distant
woodsconfound
it
what
are
the
men
about
and
why
am
i
left
vapouring
they
have
taken
advantage
of
me
the
rogues
they
are
gone
to
the
hedge
for
the
ciderjars
they
have
had
up
the
sledd
of
bread
and
meat
quite
softly
over
the
stubble
and
if
i
can
believe
my
eyes
so
dazed
with
lornas
image
they
are
sitting
down
to
an
excellent
dinner
before
the
church
clock
has
gone
eleven
john
fry
you
big
villain
i
cried
with
john
hanging
up
in
the
air
by
the
scruff
of
his
neckcloth
but
holding
still
by
his
knife
and
fork
and
a
gooseleg
in
between
his
lips
john
fry
what
mean
you
by
this
sir
latt
me
dowun
or
i
cant
tell
e
john
answered
with
some
difficulty
so
i
let
him
come
down
and
i
must
confess
that
he
had
reason
on
his
side
plaise
your
worshipjohn
called
me
so
ever
since
i
returned
from
london
firmly
believing
that
the
king
had
made
me
a
magistrate
at
least
though
i
was
to
keep
it
secretus
zeed
as
how
your
worship
were
took
with
thinkin
of
kings

in
the
middle
of
the
whaterigg
and
so
uz
zed
latt
un
coom
to
his
zell
us
had
better
zave
taime
by
takking
our
dinner
and
here
us
be
praise
your
worship
and
hopps
no
offence
with
thick
iron
spoon
full
of
vried
taties
i
was
glad
enough
to
accept
the
ladle
full
of
fried
batatas
and
to
make
the
best
of
things
which
is
generally
done
by
letting
men
have
their
own
way
therefore
i
managed
to
dine
with
them
although
it
was
so
early
for
according
to
all
that
i
can
find
in
a
long
life
and
a
varied
one
twelve
oclock
is
the
real
time
for
a
man
to
have
his
dinner
then
the
sun
is
at
his
noon
calling
halt
to
look
around
and
then
the
plants
and
leaves
are
turning
each
with
a
little
leisure
time
before
the
work
of
the
afternoon
then
is
the
balance
of
east
and
west
and
then
the
right
and
left
side
of
a
man
are
in
due
proportion
and
contribute
fairly
with
harmonious
fluids
and
the
health
of
this
mode
of
life
and
its
reclaiming

are

your

plenty
to

another

and
in
truth
we
did
reap
well
and
fairly
through
the
whole
of
that
afternoon
i
not
only
keeping
lead
but
keeping
the
men
up
to
it
we
got
through
a
matter
of
ten
acres
ere
the
sun
between
the
shocks
broke
his
light
on
wheaten

then
hung
his
red
cloak
on
the
clouds
and
fell
into
grey
slumber
seeing
this
we
wiped
our
sickles
and
our
breasts
and
foreheads
and
soon
were
on
the
homeward
road
looking
forward
to
good
supper
of
course
all
the
reapers
came
at
night
to
the
harvestsupper
and
parson
bowden
to
say
the
grace
as
well
as
to
help
to
carve
for
us
and
some
help
was
needed
there
i
can
well
assure
you
for
the
reapers
had
brave
appetites
and
most
of
their
wives
having
babies
were
forced
to
eat
as
a
duty
neither
failed
they
of
this
duty
cut
and
come
again
was
the
order
of
the
evening
as
it
had
been
of
the
day
and
i
had
no
time
to
ask
questions
but
help
meat
and
ladle
gravy
all
the
while
our
darling
annie
with
her
sleeves
tucked
up
and
her
comely
figure
panting
was
running
about
with
a
bucket
of
taties
mashed
with
lard
and
cabbage
even
lizzie
had
left
her
books
and
was
serving
out
beer
and
cider
while
mother
helped
plumpudding
largely
on
pewterplates
with
the
mutton
and
all
the
time
betty
muxworthy
was
grunting
in
and
out
everywhere
not
having
space
to
scold
even
but
changing
the
dishes
serving
the
meat
poking
the
fire
and
cooking
more
but
john
fry
would
not
stir
a
peg
except
with
his
knife
and
fork
having
all
the
airs
of
a
visitor
and
his
wife
to
keep
him
eating
till
i
thought
there
would
be
no
end
of
it
then
having
eaten
all
they
could
they
prepared
themselves
with
one
accord
for
the
business
now
of
drinking
but
first
they
lifted
the
neck
of
corn
dressed
with
ribbons
gaily
and
set
it
upon
the
mantelpiece
each
man
with
his
horn
afroth
and
then
they
sang
a
song
about
it
every
one
shouting
in
the
chorus
louder
than
harvest
thunderstorm
some
were
in
the
middle
of
one
verse
and
some
at
the
end
of
the
next
one
yet
somehow
all
managed
to
get
together
in
the
mighty
roar
of
the
burden
and
if
any
farmer
up
the
country
would
like
to
know
exmoor
harvestsong
as
sung
in
my
time
and
will
be
sung
long
after
i
am
garnered
home
lo
here
i
set
it
down
for
him
omitting
only
the
dialect
which
perchance
might
puzzle
him

the

oh
the
corn
and
the
blessing
of
the
corn
come
unto
the
door
my
lads
and
look
beneath
the
moon
we
can
see
on
hill
and
valley
how
it
is
yelloon
with
a
breadth
of
glory
as
when
our
lord
was
born
chorus
the
corn
oh
the
corn
and
the
yellow
mellow
corn
thanks
for
the
corn
with
our
bread
upon
the
board
so
shall
we
acknowledge
it
before
we
reap
the
morn
with
our
hands
to
heaven
and
our
knees
unto
the
lord
now
we
sang
this
song
very
well
the
first
time
having
the
parish
choir
to
lead
us
and
the
clarionet
and
the
parson
to
give
us
the
time
with
his
cup
and
we
sang
it
again
the
second
time
not
so
but
what
you
might
praise
it
if
you
had
been
with
us
all
the
evening
although
the
parson
was
gone
then
and
the
clerk
not
fit
to
compare
with
him
in
the
matter
of
keeping
time
but
when
that
song
was
in
its
third
singing
i
defy
any
man
however
sober
to
have
made
out
one
verse
from
the
other
or
even
the
burden
from
the
verses
inasmuch
as
every
man
present
ay
and
woman
too
sang
as
became
convenient
to
them
in
utterance
both
of
words
and
tune
and
in
truth
there
was
much
excuse
for
them
because
it
was
a
noble
harvest
fit
to
thank
the
lord
for
without
his
thinking
us
hypocrites
for
we
had
more
land
in
wheat
that
year
than
ever
we
had
before
and
twice
the
crop
to
the
acre
and
i
could
not
help
now
and
then
remembering
in
the
midst
of
the
merriment
how
my
father
in
the
churchyard
yonder
would
have
gloried
to
behold
it
and
my
mother
who
had
left
us
now
happening
to
return
just
then
being
called
to
have
her
health
drunk
for
the
twentieth
time
at
least
i
knew
by
the
sadness
in
her
eyes
that
she
was
thinking
just
as
i
was
presently
therefore
i
slipped
away
from
the
noise
and
mirth
and
smoking
although
of
that
last
there
was
not
much
except
from
farmer
nicholas
and
crossing
the
courtyard
in
the
moonlight
i
went
just
to
cool
myself
as
far
as
my
fathers
tombstone
chapter
xxx
annie
gets
the
best
of
it
i
had
long
outgrown
unwholesome
feeling
as
to
my
fathers
death
and
so
had
annie
though
lizzie
who
must
have
loved
him
least
still
entertained
some
evil
will
and
longing
for
a
punishment
therefore
i
was
surprised
and
indeed
startled
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
the
moon
being
somewhat
fleecy
to
see
our
annie
sitting
there
as
motionless
as
the
tombstone
and
with
all
her
best
fallals
upon
her
after
stowing
away
the
dishes
my
nerves
however
are
good
and
strong
except
at
least
in
love
matters
wherein
they
always
fail
me
and
when
i
meet
with
witches
and
therefore
i
went
up
to
annie
although
she
looked
so
white
and
pure
for
i
had
seen
her
before
with
those
things
on
and
it
struck
me
who
she
was
what
are
you
doing
here
annie
i
inquired
rather
sternly
being
vexed
with
her
for
having
gone
so
very
near
to
frighten
me
nothing
at
all
said
our
annie
shortly
and
indeed
it
was
truth
enough
for
a
woman
not
that
i
dare
to
believe
that
women
are
such
liars
as
men
say
only
that
i
mean
they
often
see
things
round
the
corner
and
know
not
which
is
which
of
it
and
indeed
i
never
have
known
a
woman
though
right
enough
in
their
meaning
purely
and
perfectly
true
and
transparent
except
only
my
lorna
and
even
so
i
might
not
have
loved
her
if
she
had
been
ugly
why
how
so
said
i
miss
annie
what
business
have
you
here
doing
nothing
at
this
time
of
night
and
leaving
me
with
all
the
trouble
to
entertain
our
guests
you
seem
not
to
me
to
be
doing
it
john
annie
answered
softly
what
business
have
you
here
doing
nothing
at
this
time
of
night
i
was
taken
so
aback
with
this
and
the
extreme
impertinence
of
it
from
a
mere
young
girl
like
annie
that
i
turned
round
to
march
away
and
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
her
but
she
jumped
up
and
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
threw
herself
upon
my
bosom
with
her
face
all
wet
with
tears
oh
john
i
will
tell
you
i
will
tell
you
only
dont
be
angry
john
angry
no
indeed
said
i
what
right
have
i
to
be
angry
with
you
because
you
have
your
secrets
every
chit
of
a
girl
thinks
now
that
she
has
a
right
to
her
secrets
and
you
have
none
of
your
own
john
of
course
you
have
none
of
your
own
all
your
going
out
at
night
we
will
not
quarrel
here
poor
annie
i
answered
with
some
loftiness
there
are
many
things
upon
my
mind
which
girls
can
have
no
notion
of
and
so
there
are
upon
mine
john
oh
john
i
will
tell
you
everything
if
you
will
look
at
me
kindly
and
promise
to
forgive
me
oh
i
am
so
miserable
now
this
though
she
was
behaving
so
badly
moved
me
much
towards
her
especially
as
i
longed
to
know
what
she
had
to
tell
me
therefore
i
allowed
her
to
coax
me
and
to
kiss
me
and
to
lead
me
away
a
little
as
far
as
the
old
yewtree
for
she
would
not
tell
me
where
she
was
but
even
in
the
shadow
there
she
was
very
long
before
beginning
and
seemed
to
have
two
minds
about
it
or
rather
perhaps
a
dozen
and
she
laid
her
cheek
against
the
tree
and
sobbed
till
it
was
pitiful
and
i
knew
what
mother
would
say
to
her
for
spoiling
her
best
frock
so
now
will
you
stop
i
said
at
last
harder
than
i
meant
it
for
i
knew
that
she
would
go
on
all
night
if
any
one
encouraged
her
and
though
not
well
acquainted
with
women
i
understood
my
sisters
or
else
i
must
be
a
born
foolexcept
of
course
that
i
never
professed
to
understand
eliza
yes
i
will
stop
said
annie
panting
you
are
very
hard
on
me
john
but
i
know
you
mean
it
for
the
best
if
somebody
elsei
am
sure
i
dont
know
who
and
have
no
right
to
know
no
doubt
but
she
must
be
a
wicked
thingif
somebody
else
had
been
taken
so
with
a
pain
all
round
the
heart
john
and
no
power
of
telling
it
perhaps
you
would
have
coaxed
and
kissed
her
and
come
a
little
nearer
and
made
opportunity
to
be
very
loving
now
this
was
so
exactly
what
i
had
tried
to
do
to
lorna
that
my
breath
was
almost
taken
away
at
annies
so
describing
it
for
a
while
i
could
not
say
a
word
but
wondered
if
she
were
a
witch
which
had
never
been
in
our
family
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
the
way
to
beat
her
with
the
devil
at
my
elbow
from
your
knowledge
of
these
things
annie
you
must
have
had
them
done
to
you
i
demand
to
know
this
very
moment
who
has
taken
such
liberties
then
john
you
shall
never
know
if
you
ask
in
that
manner
besides
it
was
no
liberty
in
the
least
at
all
cousins
have
a
right
to
do
thingsand
when
they
are
ones
godfather
here
annie
stopped
quite
suddenly
having
so
betrayed
herself
but
met
me
in
the
full
moonlight
being
resolved
to
face
it
out
with
a
good
face
put
upon
it
alas
i
feared
it
would
come
to
this
i
answered
very
sadly
i
know
he
has
been
here
many
a
time
without
showing
himself
to
me
there
is
nothing
meaner
than
for
a
man
to
sneak
and
steal
a
young
maids
heart
without
her
people
knowing
it
you
are
not
doing
anything
of
that
sort
yourself
then
dear
john
are
you
only
a
common
highwayman
i
answered
without
heeding
her
a
man
without
an
acre
of
his
own
and
liable
to
hang
upon
any
common
and
no
other
right
of
common
over
it
john
said
my
sister
are
the
doones
privileged
not
to
be
hanged
upon
common
land
at
this
i
was
so
thunderstruck
that
i
leaped
in
the
air
like
a
shot
rabbit
and
rushed
as
hard
as
i
could
through
the
gate
and
across
the
yard
and
back
into
the
kitchen
and
there
i
asked
farmer
nicholas
snowe
to
give
me
some
tobacco
and
to
lend
me
a
spare
pipe
this
he
did
with
a
grateful
manner
being
now
some
fivefourths
gone
and
so
i
smoked
the
very
first
pipe
that
ever
had
entered
my
lips
till
then
and
beyond
a
doubt
it
did
me
good
and
spread
my
heart
at
leisure
meanwhile
the
reapers
were
mostly
gone
to
be
up
betimes
in
the
morning
and
some
were
led
by
their
wives
and
some
had
to
lead
their
wives
themselves
according
to
the
capacity
of
man
and
wife
respectively
but
betty
was
as
lively
as
ever
bustling
about
with
every
one
and
looking
out
for
the
chance
of
groats
which
the
better
off
might
be
free
with
and
over
the
kneadingpan
next
day
she
dropped
three
and
sixpence
out
of
her
pocket
and
lizzie
could
not
tell
for
her
life
how
much
more
might
have
been
in
it
now
by
this
time
i
had
almost
finished
smoking
that
pipe
of
tobacco
and
wondering
at
myself
for
having
so
despised
it
hitherto
and
making
up
my
mind
to
have
another
trial
tomorrow
night
it
began
to
occur
to
me
that
although
dear
annie
had
behaved
so
very
badly
and
rudely
and
almost
taken
my
breath
away
with
the
suddenness
of
her
allusion
yet
it
was
not
kind
of
me
to
leave
her
out
there
at
that
time
of
night
all
alone
and
in
such
distress
any
of
the
reapers
going
home
might
be
gotten
so
far
beyond
fear
of
ghosts
as
to
venture
into
the
churchyard
and
although
they
would
know
a
great
deal
better
than
to
insult
a
sister
of
mine
when
sober
there
was
no
telling
what
they
might
do
in
their
present
state
of
rejoicing
moreover
it
was
only
right
that
i
should
learn
for
lornas
sake
how
far
annie
or
any
one
else
had
penetrated
our
secret
therefore
i
went
forth
at
once
bearing
my
pipe
in
a
skilful
manner
as
i
had
seen
farmer
nicholas
do
and
marking
with
a
new
kind
of
pleasure
how
the
rings
and
wreaths
of
smoke
hovered
and
fluttered
in
the
moonlight
like
a
lark
upon
his
carol
poor
annie
was
gone
back
again
to
our
fathers
grave
and
there
she
sat
upon
the
turf
sobbing
very
gently
and
not
wishing
to
trouble
any
one
so
i
raised
her
tenderly
and
made
much
of
her
and
consoled
her
for
i
could
not
scold
her
there
and
perhaps
after
all
she
was
not
to
be
blamed
so
much
as
tom
faggus
himself
was
annie
was
very
grateful
to
me
and
kissed
me
many
times
and
begged
my
pardon
ever
so
often
for
her
rudeness
to
me
and
then
having
gone
so
far
with
it
and
finding
me
so
complaisant
she
must
needs
try
to
go
a
little
further
and
to
lead
me
away
from
her
own
affairs
and
into
mine
concerning
lorna
but
although
it
was
clever
enough
of
her
she
was
not
deep
enough
for
me
there
and
i
soon
discovered
that
she
knew
nothing
not
even
the
name
of
my
darling
but
only
suspected
from
things
she
had
seen
and
put
together
like
a
woman
upon
this
i
brought
her
back
again
to
tom
faggus
and
his
doings
my
poor
annie
have
you
really
promised
him
to
be
his
wife
then
after
all
you
have
no
reason
john
no
particular
reason
i
mean
for
slighting
poor
sally
snowe
so
without
even
asking
mother
or
me
oh
annie
it
was
wrong
of
you
but
darling
you
know
that
mother
wishes
you
so
much
to
marry
sally
and
i
am
sure
you
could
have
her
tomorrow
she
dotes
on
the
very
ground
i
dare
say
he
tells
you
that
annie
that
he
dotes
on
the
ground
you
walk
uponbut
did
you
believe
him
child
you
may
believe
me
i
assure
you
john
and
half
the
farm
to
be
settled
upon
her
after
the
old
mans
time
and
though
she
gives
herself
little
airs
it
is
only
done
to
entice
you
she
has
the
very
best
hand
in
the
dairy
john
and
the
lightest
at
a
turnover
cake
now
annie
dont
talk
nonsense
so
i
wish
just
to
know
the
truth
about
you
and
tom
faggus
do
you
mean
to
marry
him
i
to
marry
before
my
brother
and
leave
him
with
none
to
take
care
of
him
who
can
do
him
a
red
deer
collop
except
sally
herself
as
i
can
come
home
dear
at
once
and
i
will
do
you
one
for
you
never
ate
a
morsel
of
supper
with
all
the
people
you
had
to
attend
upon
this
was
true
enough
and
seeing
no
chance
of
anything
more
than
cross
questions
and
crooked
purposes
at
which
a
girl
was
sure
to
beat
me
i
even
allowed
her
to
lead
me
home
with
the
thoughts
of
the
collop
uppermost
but
i
never
counted
upon
being
beaten
so
thoroughly
as
i
was
for
knowing
me
now
to
be
off
my
guard
the
young
hussy
stopped
at
the
farmyard
gate
as
if
with
a
brier
entangling
her
and
while
i
was
stooping
to
take
it
away
she
looked
me
full
in
the
face
by
the
moonlight
and
jerked
out
quite
suddenly
can
your
love
do
a
collop
john
no
i
should
hope
not
i
answered
rashly
she
is
not
a
mere
cookmaid
i
should
hope
she
is
not
half
so
pretty
as
sally
snowe
i
will
answer
for
that
said
annie
she
is
ten
thousand
times
as
pretty
as
ten
thousand
sally
snowes
i
replied
with
great
indignation
oh
but
look
at
sallys
eyes
cried
my
sister
rapturously
look
at
lorna
doones
said
i
and
you
would
never
look
again
at
sallys
oh
lorna
doone
lorna
doone
exclaimed
our
annie
halffrightened
yet
clapping
her
hands
with
triumph
at
having
found
me
out
so
lorna
doone
is
the
lovely
maiden
who
has
stolen
poor
somebodys
heart
so
ah
i
shall
remember
it
because
it
is
so
queer
a
name
but
stop
i
had
better
write
it
down
lend
me
your
hat
poor
boy
to
write
on
i
have
a
great
mind
to
lend
you
a
box
on
the
ear
i
answered
her
in
my
vexation
and
i
would
if
you
had
not
been
crying
so
you
sly
goodfornothing
baggage
as
it
is
i
shall
keep
it
for
master
faggus
and
add
interest
for
keeping
oh
no
john
oh
no
john
she
begged
me
earnestly
being
sobered
in
a
moment
your
hand
is
so
terribly
heavy
john
and
he
never
would
forgive
you
although
he
is
so
goodhearted
he
cannot
put
up
with
an
insult
promise
me
dear
john
that
you
will
not
strike
him
and
i
will
promise
you
faithfully
to
keep
your
secret
even
from
mother
and
even
from
cousin
tom
himself
and
from
lizzie
most
of
all
from
lizzie
i
answered
very
eagerly
knowing
too
well
which
of
my
relations
would
be
hardest
with
me
of
course
from
little
lizzie
said
annie
with
some
contempt
a
young
thing
like
her
cannot
be
kept
too
long
in
my
opinion
from
the
knowledge
of
such
subjects
and
besides
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
lizzie
had
the
right
to
know
your
secrets
as
i
have
dearest
john
not
a
soul
shall
be
the
wiser
for
your
having
trusted
me
john
although
i
shall
be
very
wretched
when
you
are
late
away
at
night
among
those
dreadful
people
well
i
replied
it
is
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
annie
you
have
my
secret
and
i
have
yours
and
i
scarcely
know
which
of
the
two
is
likely
to
have
the
worst
time
of
it
when
it
comes
to
mothers
ears
i
could
put
up
with
perpetual
scolding
but
not
with
mothers
sad
silence
that
is
exactly
how
i
feel
john
and
as
annie
said
it
she
brightened
up
and
her
soft
eyes
shone
upon
me
but
now
i
shall
be
much
happier
dear
because
i
shall
try
to
help
you
no
doubt
the
young
lady
deserves
it
john
she
is
not
after
the
farm
i
hope
she
i
exclaimed
and
that
was
enough
there
was
so
much
scorn
in
my
voice
and
face
then
i
am
sure
i
am
very
glad
annie
always
made
the
best
of
things
for
i
do
believe
that
sally
snowe
has
taken
a
fancy
to
our
dairyplace
and
the
pattern
of
our
creampans
and
she
asked
so
much
about
our
meadows
and
the
colour
of
the
milk
then
after
all
you
were
right
dear
annie
it
is
the
ground
she
dotes
upon
and
the
things
that
walk
upon
it
she
answered
me
with
another
kiss
sally
has
taken
a
wonderful
fancy
to
our
best
cow
nipplepins
but
she
never
shall
have
her
now
what
a
consolation
we
entered
the
house
quite
gently
thus
and
found
farmer
nicholas
snowe
asleep
little
dreaming
how
his
plans
had
been
overset
between
us
and
then
annie
said
to
me
very
slyly
between
a
smile
and
a
blush
dont
you
wish
lorna
doone
was
here
john
in
the
parlour
along
with
mother
instead
of
those
two
fashionable
milkmaids
as
uncle
ben
will
call
them
and
poor
stupid
mistress
kebby
that
indeed
i
do
annie
i
must
kiss
you
for
only
thinking
of
it
dear
me
it
seems
as
if
you
had
known
all
about
us
for
a
twelvemonth
she
loves
you
with
all
her
heart
john
no
doubt
about
that
of
course
and
annie
looked
up
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
she
would
like
to
know
who
could
help
it
thats
the
very
thing
she
wont
do
said
i
knowing
that
annie
would
love
me
all
the
more
for
it
she
is
only
beginning
to
like
me
annie
and
as
for
loving
she
is
so
young
that
she
only
loves
her
grandfather
but
i
hope
she
will
come
to
it
byandby
of
course
she
must
replied
my
sister
it
will
be
impossible
for
her
to
help
it
ah
well
i
dont
know
for
i
wanted
more
assurance
of
it
maidens
are
such
wondrous
things
not
a
bit
of
it
said
annie
casting
her
bright
eyes
downwards
love
is
as
simple
as
milking
when
people
know
how
to
do
it
but
you
must
not
let
her
alone
too
long
that
is
my
advice
to
you
what
a
simpleton
you
must
have
been
not
to
tell
me
long
ago
i
would
have
made
lorna
wild
about
you
long
before
this
time
johnny
but
now
you
go
into
the
parlour
dear
while
i
do
your
collop
faith
snowe
is
not
come
but
polly
and
sally
sally
has
made
up
her
mind
to
conquer
you
this
very
blessed
evening
john
only
look
what
a
thing
of
a
scarf
she
has
on
i
should
be
quite
ashamed
to
wear
it
but
you
wont
strike
poor
tom
will
you
not
i
my
darling
for
your
sweet
sake
and
so
dear
annie
having
grown
quite
brave
gave
me
a
little
push
into
the
parlour
where
i
was
quite
abashed
to
enter
after
all
i
had
heard
about
sally
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
examine
her
well
and
try
a
little
courting
with
her
if
she
should
lead
me
on
that
i
might
be
in
practice
for
lorna
but
when
i
perceived
how
grandly
and
richly
both
the
young
damsels
were
apparelled
and
how
in
their
curtseys
to
me
they
retreated
as
if
i
were
making
up
to
them
in
a
way
they
had
learned
from
exeter
and
how
they
began
to
talk
of
the
court
as
if
they
had
been
there
all
their
lives
and
the
latest
mode
of
the
duchess
of
this
and
the
profile
of
the
countess
of
that
and
the
last
good
saying
of
my
lord
something
instead
of
butter
and
cream
and
eggs
and
things
which
they
understood
i
knew
there
must
be
somebody
in
the
room
besides
jasper
kebby
to
talk
at
and
so
there
was
for
behind
the
curtain
drawn
across
the
windowseat
no
less
a
man
than
uncle
ben
was
sitting
half
asleep
and
weary
and
by
his
side
a
little
girl
very
quiet
and
very
watchful
my
mother
led
me
to
uncle
ben
and
he
took
my
hand
without
rising
muttering
something
not
overpolite
about
my
being
bigger
than
ever
i
asked
him
heartily
how
he
was
and
he
said
well
enough
for
that
matter
but
none
the
better
for
the
noise
you
great
clods
have
been
making
i
am
sorry
if
we
have
disturbed
you
sir
i
answered
very
civilly
but
i
knew
not
that
you
were
here
even
and
you
must
allow
for
harvest
time
so
it
seems
he
replied
and
allow
a
great
deal
including
waste
and
drunkenness
now
if
you
can
see
so
small
a
thing
after
emptying
flagons
much
larger
this
is
my
granddaughter
and
my
heiresshere
he
glanced
at
mothermy
heiress
little
ruth
huckaback
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
ruth
i
answered
offering
her
my
hand
which
she
seemed
afraid
to
take
welcome
to
plovers
barrows
my
good
cousin
ruth
however
my
good
cousin
ruth
only
arose
and
made
me
a
curtsey
and
lifted
her
great
brown
eyes
at
me
more
in
fear
as
i
thought
than
kinship
and
if
ever
any
one
looked
unlike
the
heiress
to
great
property
it
was
the
little
girl
before
me
come
out
to
the
kitchen
dear
and
let
me
chuck
you
to
the
ceiling
i
said
just
to
encourage
her
i
always
do
it
to
little
girls
and
then
they
can
see
the
hams
and
bacon
but
uncle
reuben
burst
out
laughing
and
ruth
turned
away
with
a
deep
rich
colour
do
you
know
how
old
she
is
you
numskull
said
uncle
ben
in
his
dryest
drawl
she
was
seventeen
last
july
sir
on
the
first
of
july
grandfather
ruth
whispered
with
her
back
still
to
me
but
many
people
will
not
believe
it
here
mother
came
up
to
my
rescue
as
she
always
loved
to
do
and
she
said
if
my
son
may
not
dance
miss
ruth
at
any
rate
he
may
dance
with
her
we
have
only
been
waiting
for
you
dear
john
to
have
a
little
harvest
dance
with
the
kitchen
door
thrown
open
you
take
ruth
uncle
ben
take
sally
master
debby
pair
off
with
polly
and
neighbour
nicholas
will
be
good
enough
if
i
can
awake
him
to
stand
up
with
fair
mistress
kebby
lizzie
will
play
us
the
virginal
wont
you
lizzie
dear
but
who
is
to
dance
with
you
madam
uncle
ben
asked
very
politely
i
think
you
must
rearrange
your
figure
i
have
not
danced
for
a
score
of
years
and
i
will
not
dance
now
while
the
mistress
and
the
owner
of
the
harvest
sits
aside
neglected
nay
master
huckaback
cried
sally
snowe
with
a
saucy
toss
of
her
hair
mistress
ridd
is
too
kind
a
great
deal
in
handing
you
over
to
me
you
take
her
and
i
will
fetch
annie
to
be
my
partner
this
evening
i
like
dancing
very
much
better
with
girls
for
they
never
squeeze
and
rumple
one
oh
it
is
so
much
nicer
have
no
fear
for
me
my
dears
our
mother
answered
smiling
parson
bowden
promised
to
come
back
again
i
expect
him
every
minute
and
he
intends
to
lead
me
off
and
to
bring
a
partner
for
annie
too
a
very
pretty
young
gentleman
now
begin
and
i
will
join
you
there
was
no
disobeying
her
without
rudeness
and
indeed
the
girls
feet
were
already
jigging
and
lizzie
giving
herself
wonderful
airs
with
a
roll
of
learned
music
and
even
while
annie
was
doing
my
collop
her
pretty
round
instep
was
arching
itself
as
i
could
see
from
the
parlourdoor
so
i
took
little
ruth
and
i
spun
her
around
as
the
sound
of
the
music
came
lively
and
ringing
and
after
us
came
all
the
rest
with
much
laughter
begging
me
not
to
jump
over
her
and
anon
my
grave
partner
began
to
smile
sweetly
and
look
up
at
me
with
the
brightest
of
eyes
and
drop
me
the
prettiest
curtseys
till
i
thought
what
a
great
stupe
i
must
have
been
to
dream
of
putting
her
in
the
cheeserack
but
one
thing
i
could
not
at
all
understand
why
mother
who
used
to
do
all
in
her
power
to
throw
me
across
sally
snowe
should
now
do
the
very
opposite
for
she
would
not
allow
me
one
moment
with
sally
not
even
to
cross
in
the
dance
or
whisper
or
go
anywhere
near
a
corner
which
as
i
said
i
intended
to
do
just
by
way
of
practice
while
she
kept
me
all
the
evening
as
close
as
possible
with
ruth
huckaback
and
came
up
and
praised
me
so
to
ruth
times
and
again
that
i
declare
i
was
quite
ashamed
although
of
course
i
knew
that
i
deserved
it
all
but
i
could
not
well
say
that
then
annie
came
sailing
down
the
dance
with
her
beautiful
hair
flowing
round
her
the
lightest
figure
in
all
the
room
and
the
sweetest
and
the
loveliest
she
was
blushing
with
her
fair
cheeks
red
beneath
her
dear
blue
eyes
as
she
met
my
glance
of
surprise
and
grief
at
the
partner
she
was
leaning
on
it
was
squire
marwood
de
whichehalse
i
would
sooner
have
seen
her
with
tom
faggus
as
indeed
i
had
expected
when
i
heard
of
parson
bowden
and
to
me
it
seemed
that
she
had
no
right
to
be
dancing
so
with
any
other
and
to
this
effect
i
contrived
to
whisper
but
she
only
said
see
to
yourself
john
no
but
let
us
both
enjoy
ourselves
you
are
not
dancing
with
lorna
john
but
you
seem
uncommonly
happy
tush
i
said
could
i
flip
about
so
if
i
had
my
love
with
me
chapter
xxxi
john
frys
errand
we
kept
up
the
dance
very
late
that
night
mother
being
in
such
wonderful
spirits
that
she
would
not
hear
of
our
going
to
bed
while
she
glanced
from
young
squire
marwood
very
deep
in
his
talk
with
our
annie
to
me
and
ruth
huckaback
who
were
beginning
to
be
very
pleasant
company
alas
poor
mother
so
proud
as
she
was
how
little
she
dreamed
that
her
good
schemes
already
were
hopelessly
going
awry
being
forced
to
be
up
before
daylight
next
day
in
order
to
begin
right
early
i
would
not
go
to
my
bedroom
that
night
for
fear
of
disturbing
my
mother
but
determined
to
sleep
in
the
tallat
awhile
that
place
being
cool
and
airy
and
refreshing
with
the
smell
of
sweet
hay
moreover
after
my
dwelling
in
town
where
i
had
felt
like
a
horse
on
a
limekiln
i
could
not
for
a
length
of
time
have
enough
of
country
life
the
mooing
of
a
calf
was
music
and
the
chuckle
of
a
fowl
was
wit
and
the
snore
of
the
horses
was
news
to
me
wult
have
thee
own
wai
i
reckon
said
betty
being
cross
with
sleepiness
for
she
had
washed
up
everything
slape
in
hogpound
if
thee
laikes
jan
letting
her
have
the
last
word
of
it
as
is
the
due
of
women
i
stood
in
the
court
and
wondered
awhile
at
the
glory
of
the
harvest
moon
and
the
yellow
world
it
shone
upon
then
i
saw
as
sure
as
ever
i
was
standing
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
stable
i
saw
a
short
wide
figure
glide
across
the
foot
of
the
courtyard
between
me
and
the
sixbarred
gate
instead
of
running
after
it
as
i
should
have
done
i
began
to
consider
who
it
could
be
and
what
on
earth
was
doing
there
when
all
our
people
were
in
bed
and
the
reapers
gone
home
or
to
the
linhay
close
against
the
wheatfield
having
made
up
my
mind
at
last
that
it
could
be
none
of
our
peoplethough
not
a
dog
was
barkingand
also
that
it
must
have
been
either
a
girl
or
a
woman
i
ran
down
with
all
speed
to
learn
what
might
be
the
meaning
of
it
but
i
came
too
late
to
learn
through
my
own
hesitation
for
this
was
the
lower
end
of
the
courtyard
not
the
approach
from
the
parish
highway
but
the
end
of
the
sleddway
across
the
fields
where
the
brook
goes
down
to
the
lynn
stream
and
where
squire
faggus
had
saved
the
old
drake
and
of
course
the
dry
channel
of
the
brook
being
scarcely
any
water
now
afforded
plenty
of
place
to
hide
leading
also
to
a
little
coppice
beyond
our
cabbagegarden
and
so
further
on
to
the
parish
highway
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
vain
to
make
any
pursuit
by
moonlight
and
resolving
to
hold
my
own
counsel
about
it
though
puzzled
not
a
little
and
to
keep
watch
there
another
night
back
i
returned
to
the
tallattladder
and
slept
without
leaving
off
till
morning
now
many
people
may
wish
to
know
as
indeed
i
myself
did
very
greatly
what
had
brought
master
huckaback
over
from
dulverton
at
that
time
of
year
when
the
clothing
business
was
most
active
on
account
of
harvest
wages
and
when
the
new
wheat
was
beginning
to
sample
from
the
early
parts
up
the
country
for
he
meddled
as
well
in
corndealing
and
when
we
could
not
attend
to
him
properly
by
reason
of
our
occupation
and
yet
more
surprising
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
should
have
brought
his
granddaughter
also
instead
of
the
troop
of
dragoons
without
which
he
had
vowed
he
would
never
come
here
again
and
how
he
had
managed
to
enter
the
house
together
with
his
granddaughter
and
be
sitting
quite
at
home
in
the
parlour
there
without
any
knowledge
or
even
suspicion
on
my
part
that
last
question
was
easily
solved
for
mother
herself
had
admitted
them
by
means
of
the
little
passage
during
a
chorus
of
the
harvestsong
which
might
have
drowned
an
earthquake
but
as
for
his
meaning
and
motive
and
apparent
neglect
of
his
business
none
but
himself
could
interpret
them
and
as
he
did
not
see
fit
to
do
so
we
could
not
be
rude
enough
to
inquire
he
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
take
his
departure
though
his
visit
was
so
inconvenient
to
us
as
himself
indeed
must
have
noticed
and
presently
lizzie
who
was
the
sharpest
among
us
said
in
my
hearing
that
she
believed
he
had
purposely
timed
his
visit
so
that
he
might
have
liberty
to
pursue
his
own
object
whatsoever
it
were
without
interruption
from
us
mother
gazed
hard
upon
lizzie
at
this
having
formed
a
very
different
opinion
but
annie
and
myself
agreed
that
it
was
worth
looking
into
now
how
could
we
look
into
it
without
watching
uncle
reuben
whenever
he
went
abroad
and
trying
to
catch
him
in
his
speech
when
he
was
taking
his
ease
at
night
for
in
spite
of
all
the
disgust
with
which
he
had
spoken
of
harvest
wassailing
there
was
not
a
man
coming
into
our
kitchen
who
liked
it
better
than
he
did
only
in
a
quiet
way
and
without
too
many
witnesses
now
to
endeavour
to
get
at
the
purpose
of
any
guest
even
a
treacherous
one
which
we
had
no
right
to
think
uncle
reuben
by
means
of
observing
him
in
his
cups
is
a
thing
which
even
the
lowest
of
people
would
regard
with
abhorrence
and
to
my
mind
it
was
not
clear
whether
it
would
be
fairplay
at
all
to
follow
a
visitor
even
at
a
distance
from
home
and
clear
of
our
premises
except
for
the
purpose
of
fetching
him
back
and
giving
him
more
to
go
on
with
nevertheless
we
could
not
but
think
the
times
being
wild
and
disjointed
that
uncle
ben
was
not
using
fairly
the
part
of
a
guest
in
our
house
to
make
long
expeditions
we
knew
not
whither
and
involve
us
in
trouble
we
knew
not
what
for
his
mode
was
directly
after
breakfast
to
pray
to
the
lord
a
little
which
used
not
to
be
his
practice
and
then
to
go
forth
upon
dolly
the
which
was
our
annies
pony
very
quiet
and
respectful
with
a
bag
of
good
victuals
hung
behind
him
and
two
great
cavalry
pistols
in
front
and
he
always
wore
his
meanest
clothes
as
if
expecting
to
be
robbed
or
to
disarm
the
temptation
thereto
and
he
never
took
his
golden
chronometer
neither
his
bag
of
money
so
much
the
girls
found
out
and
told
me
for
i
was
never
at
home
myself
by
day
and
they
very
craftily
spurred
me
on
having
less
noble
ideas
perhaps
to
hit
upon
uncle
reubens
track
and
follow
and
see
what
became
of
him
for
he
never
returned
until
dark
or
more
just
in
time
to
be
in
before
us
who
were
coming
home
from
the
harvest
and
then
dolly
always
seemed
very
weary
and
stained
with
a
muck
from
beyond
our
parish
but
i
refused
to
follow
him
not
only
for
the
loss
of
a
days
work
to
myself
and
at
least
half
a
day
to
the
other
men
but
chiefly
because
i
could
not
think
that
it
would
be
upright
and
manly
it
was
all
very
well
to
creep
warily
into
the
valley
of
the
doones
and
heed
everything
around
me
both
because
they
were
public
enemies
and
also
because
i
risked
my
life
at
every
step
i
took
there
but
as
to
tracking
a
feeble
old
man
however
subtle
he
might
be
a
guest
moreover
of
our
own
and
a
relative
through
my
motheronce
for
all
i
said
it
is
below
me
and
i
wont
do
it
thereupon
the
girls
knowing
my
way
ceased
to
torment
me
about
it
but
what
was
my
astonishment
the
very
next
day
to
perceive
that
instead
of
fourteen
reapers
we
were
only
thirteen
left
directly
our
breakfast
was
done
withor
mowers
rather
i
should
say
for
we
were
gone
into
the
barley
now
who
has
been
and
left
his
scythe
i
asked
and
heres
a
tin
cup
never
been
handled
whoy
dudnt
ee
knaw
maister
jan
said
bill
dadds
looking
at
me
queerly
as
jan
vry
wur
gane
avore
braxvass
oh
very
well
i
answered
john
knows
what
he
is
doing
for
john
fry
was
a
kind
of
foreman
now
and
it
would
not
do
to
say
anything
that
might
lessen
his
authority
however
i
made
up
my
mind
to
rope
him
when
i
should
catch
him
by
himself
without
peril
to
his
dignity
but
when
i
came
home
in
the
evening
late
and
almost
weary
there
was
no
annie
cooking
my
supper
nor
lizzie
by
the
fire
reading
nor
even
little
ruth
huckaback
watching
the
shadows
and
pondering
upon
this
i
went
to
the
girls
room
not
in
the
very
best
of
tempers
and
there
i
found
all
three
of
them
in
the
little
place
set
apart
for
annie
eagerly
listening
to
john
fry
who
was
telling
some
great
adventure
john
had
a
great
jug
of
ale
beside
him
and
a
horn
well
drained
and
he
clearly
looked
upon
himself
as
a
hero
and
the
maids
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
well
done
john
my
sister
was
saying
capitally
done
john
fry
how
very
brave
you
have
been
john
now
quick
let
us
hear
the
rest
of
it
what
does
all
this
nonsense
mean
i
said
in
a
voice
which
frightened
them
as
i
could
see
by
the
light
of
our
own
mutton
candles
john
fry
you
be
off
to
your
wife
at
once
or
you
shall
have
what
i
owe
you
now
instead
of
tomorrow
morning
john
made
no
answer
but
scratched
his
head
and
looked
at
the
maidens
to
take
his
part
it
is
you
that
must
be
off
i
think
said
lizzie
looking
straight
at
me
with
all
the
impudence
in
the
world
what
right
have
you
to
come
in
here
to
the
young
ladies
room
without
an
invitation
even
very
well
miss
lizzie
i
suppose
mother
has
some
right
here
and
with
that
i
was
going
away
to
fetch
her
knowing
that
she
always
took
my
side
and
never
would
allow
the
house
to
be
turned
upside
down
in
that
manner
but
annie
caught
hold
of
me
by
the
arm
and
little
ruth
stood
in
the
doorway
and
lizzie
said
dont
be
a
fool
john
we
know
things
of
you
you
know
a
great
deal
more
than
you
dream
of
upon
this
i
glanced
at
annie
to
learn
whether
she
had
been
telling
but
her
pure
true
face
reassured
me
at
once
and
then
she
said
very
gently
lizzie
you
talk
too
fast
my
child
no
one
knows
anything
of
our
john
which
he
need
be
ashamed
of
and
working
as
he
does
from
light
to
dusk
and
earning
the
living
of
all
of
us
he
is
entitled
to
choose
his
own
good
time
for
going
out
and
for
coming
in
without
consulting
a
little
girl
five
years
younger
than
himself
now
john
sit
down
and
you
shall
know
all
that
we
have
done
though
i
doubt
whether
you
will
approve
of
it
upon
this
i
kissed
annie
and
so
did
ruth
and
john
fry
looked
a
deal
more
comfortable
but
lizzie
only
made
a
face
at
us
then
annie
began
as
follows
you
must
know
dear
john
that
we
have
been
extremely
curious
ever
since
uncle
reuben
came
to
know
what
he
was
come
for
especially
at
this
time
of
year
when
he
is
at
his
busiest
he
never
vouchsafed
any
explanation
neither
gave
any
reason
true
or
false
which
shows
his
entire
ignorance
of
all
feminine
nature
if
ruth
had
known
and
refused
to
tell
us
we
should
have
been
much
easier
because
we
must
have
got
it
out
of
ruth
before
two
or
three
days
were
over
but
darling
ruth
knew
no
more
than
we
did
and
indeed
i
must
do
her
the
justice
to
say
that
she
has
been
quite
as
inquisitive
well
we
might
have
put
up
with
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
taking
dolly
my
own
pet
dolly
away
every
morning
quite
as
if
she
belonged
to
him
and
keeping
her
out
until
close
upon
dark
and
then
bringing
her
home
in
a
frightful
condition
and
he
even
had
the
impudence
when
i
told
him
that
dolly
was
my
pony
to
say
that
we
owed
him
a
pony
ever
since
you
took
from
him
that
little
horse
upon
which
you
found
him
strapped
so
snugly
and
he
means
to
take
dolly
to
dulverton
with
him
to
run
in
his
little
cart
if
there
is
law
in
the
land
he
shall
not
surely
john
you
will
not
let
him
that
i
wont
said
i
except
upon
the
conditions
which
i
offered
him
once
before
if
we
owe
him
the
pony
we
owe
him
the
straps
sweet
annie
laughed
like
a
bell
at
this
and
then
she
went
on
with
her
story
well
john
we
were
perfectly
miserable
you
cannot
understand
it
of
course
but
i
used
to
go
every
evening
and
hug
poor
dolly
and
kiss
her
and
beg
her
to
tell
me
where
she
had
been
and
what
she
had
seen
that
day
but
never
having
belonged
to
balaam
darling
dolly
was
quite
unsuccessful
though
often
she
strove
to
tell
me
with
her
ears
down
and
both
eyes
rolling
then
i
made
john
fry
tie
her
tail
in
a
knot
with
a
piece
of
white
ribbon
as
if
for
adornment
that
i
might
trace
her
among
the
hills
at
any
rate
for
a
mile
or
two
but
uncle
ben
was
too
deep
for
that
he
cut
off
the
ribbon
before
he
started
saying
he
would
have
no
doones
after
him
and
then
in
despair
i
applied
to
you
knowing
how
quick
of
foot
you
are
and
i
got
ruth
and
lizzie
to
help
me
but
you
answered
us
very
shortly
and
a
very
poor
supper
you
had
that
night
according
to
your
deserts
but
though
we
were
dashed
to
the
ground
for
a
time
we
were
not
wholly
discomfited
our
determination
to
know
all
about
it
seemed
to
increase
with
the
difficulty
and
uncle
bens
manner
last
night
was
so
dry
when
we
tried
to
romp
and
to
lead
him
out
that
it
was
much
worse
than
jamaica
ginger
grated
into
a
poor
sprayed
finger
so
we
sent
him
to
bed
at
the
earliest
moment
and
held
a
small
council
upon
him
if
you
remember
you
john
having
now
taken
to
smoke
which
is
a
hateful
practice
had
gone
forth
grumbling
about
your
bad
supper
and
not
taking
it
as
a
good
lesson
why
annie
i
cried
in
amazement
at
this
i
will
never
trust
you
again
for
a
supper
i
thought
you
were
so
sorry
and
so
i
was
dear
very
sorry
but
still
we
must
do
our
duty
and
when
we
came
to
consider
it
ruth
was
the
cleverest
of
us
all
for
she
said
that
surely
we
must
have
some
man
we
could
trust
about
the
farm
to
go
on
a
little
errand
and
then
i
remembered
that
old
john
fry
would
do
anything
for
money
not
for
money
plaize
miss
said
john
fry
taking
a
pull
at
the
beer
but
for
the
love
of
your
swate
face
to
be
sure
john
with
the
kings
behind
it
and
so
lizzie
ran
for
john
fry
at
once
and
we
gave
him
full
directions
how
he
was
to
slip
out
of
the
barley
in
the
confusion
of
the
breakfast
so
that
none
might
miss
him
and
to
run
back
to
the
black
combe
bottom
and
there
he
would
find
the
very
same
pony
which
uncle
ben
had
been
tied
upon
and
there
is
no
faster
upon
the
farm
and
then
without
waiting
for
any
breakfast
unless
he
could
eat
it
either
running
or
trotting
he
was
to
travel
all
up
the
black
combe
by
the
track
uncle
reuben
had
taken
and
up
at
the
top
to
look
forward
carefully
and
so
to
trace
him
without
being
seen
ay
and
raight
wull
a
dood
un
john
cried
with
his
mouth
in
the
bullocks
horn
well
and
what
did
you
see
john
i
asked
with
great
anxiety
though
i
meant
to
have
shown
no
interest
john
was
just
at
the
very
point
of
it
lizzie
answered
me
sharply
when
you
chose
to
come
in
and
stop
him
then
let
him
begin
again
said
i
things
being
gone
so
far
it
is
now
my
duty
to
know
everything
for
the
sake
of
you
girls
and
mother
hem
cried
lizzie
in
a
nasty
way
but
i
took
no
notice
of
her
for
she
was
always
bad
to
deal
with
therefore
john
fry
began
again
being
heartily
glad
to
do
so
that
his
story
might
get
out
of
the
tumble
which
all
our
talk
had
made
in
it
but
as
he
could
not
tell
a
tale
in
the
manner
of
my
lorna
although
he
told
it
very
well
for
those
who
understood
him
i
will
take
it
from
his
mouth
altogether
and
state
in
brief
what
happened
when
john
upon
his
forest
pony
which
he
had
much
ado
to
hold
its
mouth
being
like
a
bucket
was
come
to
the
top
of
the
long
black
combe
two
miles
or
more
from
plovers
barrows
and
winding
to
the
southward
he
stopped
his
little
nag
short
of
the
crest
and
got
off
and
looked
ahead
of
him
from
behind
a
tump
of
whortles
it
was
a
long
flat
sweep
of
moorland
over
which
he
was
gazing
with
a
few
bogs
here
and
there
and
brushy
places
round
them
of
course
john
fry
from
his
shepherd
life
and
reclaiming
of
strayed
cattle
knew
as
well
as
need
be
where
he
was
and
the
spread
of
the
hills
before
him
although
it
was
beyond
our
beat
or
rather
i
should
say
beside
it
not
but
what
we
might
have
grazed
there
had
it
been
our
pleasure
but
that
it
was
not
worth
our
while
and
scarcely
worth
jasper
kebbys
even
all
the
land
being
cropped
as
one
might
say
with
desolation
and
nearly
all
our
knowledge
of
it
sprang
from
the
unaccountable
tricks
of
cows
who
have
young
calves
with
them
at
which
time
they
have
wild
desire
to
get
away
from
the
sight
of
man
and
keep
calf
and
milk
for
one
another
although
it
be
in
a
barren
land
at
least
our
cows
have
gotten
this
trick
and
i
have
heard
other
people
complain
of
it
john
fry
as
i
said
knew
the
place
well
enough
but
he
liked
it
none
the
more
for
that
neither
did
any
of
our
people
and
indeed
all
the
neighbourhood
of
thomshill
and
larksborough
and
most
of
all
black
barrow
down
lay
under
grave
imputation
of
having
been
enchanted
with
a
very
evil
spell
moreover
it
was
known
though
folk
were
loath
to
speak
of
it
even
on
a
summer
morning
that
squire
thom
who
had
been
murdered
there
a
century
ago
or
more
had
been
seen
by
several
shepherds
even
in
the
middle
day
walking
with
his
severed
head
carried
in
his
left
hand
and
his
right
arm
lifted
towards
the
sun
therefore
it
was
very
bold
in
john
as
i
acknowledged
to
venture
across
that
moor
alone
even
with
a
fast
pony
under
him
and
some
whisky
by
his
side
and
he
would
never
have
done
so
of
that
i
am
quite
certain
either
for
the
sake
of
annies
sweet
face
or
of
the
golden
guinea
which
the
three
maidens
had
subscribed
to
reward
his
skill
and
valour
but
the
truth
was
that
he
could
not
resist
his
own
great
curiosity
for
carefully
spying
across
the
moor
from
behind
the
tuft
of
whortles
at
first
he
could
discover
nothing
having
life
and
motion
except
three
or
four
wild
cattle
roving
in
vain
search
for
nourishment
and
a
diseased
sheep
banished
hither
and
some
carrion
crows
keeping
watch
on
her
but
when
john
was
taking
his
very
last
look
being
only
too
glad
to
go
home
again
and
acknowledge
himself
baffled
he
thought
he
saw
a
figure
moving
in
the
farthest
distance
upon
black
barrow
down
scarcely
a
thing
to
be
sure
of
yet
on
account
of
the
want
of
colour
but
as
he
watched
the
figure
passed
between
him
and
a
naked
cliff
and
appeared
to
be
a
man
on
horseback
making
his
way
very
carefully
in
fear
of
bogs
and
serpents
for
all
about
there
it
is
adders
ground
and
large
black
serpents
dwell
in
the
marshes
and
can
swim
as
well
as
crawl
john
knew
that
the
man
who
was
riding
there
could
be
none
but
uncle
reuben
for
none
of
the
doones
ever
passed
that
way
and
the
shepherds
were
afraid
of
it
and
now
it
seemed
an
unkind
place
for
an
unarmed
man
to
venture
through
especially
after
an
armed
one
who
might
not
like
to
be
spied
upon
and
must
have
some
dark
object
in
visiting
such
drear
solitudes
nevertheless
john
fry
so
ached
with
unbearable
curiosity
to
know
what
an
old
man
and
a
stranger
and
a
rich
man
and
a
peaceable
could
possibly
be
after
in
that
mysterious
manner
moreover
john
so
throbbed
with
hope
to
find
some
wealthy
secret
that
come
what
would
of
it
he
resolved
to
go
to
the
end
of
the
matter
therefore
he
only
waited
awhile
for
fear
of
being
discovered
till
master
huckaback
turned
to
the
left
and
entered
a
little
gully
whence
he
could
not
survey
the
moor
then
john
remounted
and
crossed
the
rough
land
and
the
stony
places
and
picked
his
way
among
the
morasses
as
fast
as
ever
he
dared
to
go
until
in
about
half
an
hour
he
drew
nigh
the
entrance
of
the
gully
and
now
it
behoved
him
to
be
most
wary
for
uncle
ben
might
have
stopped
in
there
either
to
rest
his
horse
or
having
reached
the
end
of
his
journey
and
in
either
case
john
had
little
doubt
that
he
himself
would
be
pistolled
and
nothing
more
ever
heard
of
him
therefore
he
made
his
pony
come
to
the
mouth
of
it
sideways
and
leaned
over
and
peered
in
around
the
rocky
corner
while
the
little
horse
cropped
at
the
briars
but
he
soon
perceived
that
the
gully
was
empty
so
far
at
least
as
its
course
was
straight
and
with
that
he
hastened
into
it
though
his
heart
was
not
working
easily
when
he
had
traced
the
winding
hollow
for
half
a
mile
or
more
he
saw
that
it
forked
and
one
part
led
to
the
left
up
a
steep
red
bank
and
the
other
to
the
right
being
narrow
and
slightly
tending
downwards
some
yellow
sand
lay
here
and
there
between
the
starving
grasses
and
this
he
examined
narrowly
for
a
trace
of
master
huckaback
at
last
he
saw
that
beyond
all
doubt
the
man
he
was
pursuing
had
taken
the
course
which
led
down
hill
and
down
the
hill
he
must
follow
him
and
this
john
did
with
deep
misgivings
and
a
hearty
wish
that
he
had
never
started
upon
so
perilous
an
errand
for
now
he
knew
not
where
he
was
and
scarcely
dared
to
ask
himself
having
heard
of
a
horrible
hole
somewhere
in
this
neighbourhood
called
the
wizards
slough
therefore
john
rode
down
the
slope
with
sorrow
and
great
caution
and
these
grew
more
as
he
went
onward
and
his
pony
reared
against
him
being
scared
although
a
native
of
the
roughest
moorland
and
john
had
just
made
up
his
mind
that
god
meant
this
for
a
warning
as
the
passage
seemed
darker
and
deeper
when
suddenly
he
turned
a
corner
and
saw
a
scene
which
stopped
him
for
there
was
the
wizards
slough
itself
as
black
as
death
and
bubbling
with
a
few
scant
yellow
reeds
in
a
ring
around
it
outside
these
bright
watergrass
of
the
liveliest
green
was
creeping
tempting
any
unwary
foot
to
step
and
plunge
and
founder
and
on
the
marge
were
blue
campanula
sundew
and
forgetmenot
such
as
no
child
could
resist
on
either
side
the
hill
fell
back
and
the
ground
was
broken
with
tufts
of
rush
and
flag
and
marestail
and
a
few
rough
aldertrees
overclogged
with
water
and
not
a
bird
was
seen
or
heard
neither
rail
nor
waterhen
wagtail
nor
reedwarbler
of
this
horrible
quagmire
the
worst
upon
all
exmoor
john
had
heard
from
his
grandfather
and
even
from
his
mother
when
they
wanted
to
keep
him
quiet
but
his
father
had
feared
to
speak
of
it
to
him
being
a
man
of
piety
and
up
to
the
tricks
of
the
evil
one
this
made
john
the
more
desirous
to
have
a
good
look
at
it
now
only
with
his
girths
well
up
to
turn
away
and
flee
at
speed
if
anything
should
happen
and
now
he
proved
how
well
it
is
to
be
wary
and
wideawake
even
in
lonesome
places
for
at
the
other
side
of
the
slough
and
a
few
landyards
beyond
it
where
the
ground
was
less
noisome
he
had
observed
a
felled
tree
lying
over
a
great
hole
in
the
earth
with
staves
of
wood
and
slabs
of
stone
and
some
yellow
gravel
around
it
but
the
flags
of
reeds
around
the
morass
partly
screened
it
from
his
eyes
and
he
could
not
make
out
the
meaning
of
it
except
that
it
meant
no
good
and
probably
was
witchcraft
yet
dolly
seemed
not
to
be
harmed
by
it
for
there
she
was
as
large
as
life
tied
to
a
stump
not
far
beyond
and
flipping
the
flies
away
with
her
tail
while
john
was
trembling
within
himself
lest
dolly
should
get
scent
of
his
pony
and
neigh
and
reveal
their
presence
although
she
could
not
see
them
suddenly
to
his
great
amazement
something
white
arose
out
of
the
hole
under
the
brown
trunk
of
the
tree
seeing
this
his
blood
went
back
within
him
yet
he
was
not
able
to
turn
and
flee
but
rooted
his
face
in
among
the
loose
stones
and
kept
his
quivering
shoulders
back
and
prayed
to
god
to
protect
him
however
the
white
thing
itself
was
not
so
very
awful
being
nothing
more
than
a
longconed
nightcap
with
a
tassel
on
the
top
such
as
criminals
wear
at
hangingtime
but
when
john
saw
a
mans
face
under
it
and
a
mans
neck
and
shoulders
slowly
rising
out
of
the
pit
he
could
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
place
where
the
murderers
come
to
life
again
according
to
the
exmoor
story
he
knew
that
a
man
had
been
hanged
last
week
and
that
this
was
the
ninth
day
after
it
therefore
he
could
bear
no
more
thoroughly
brave
as
he
had
been
neither
did
he
wait
to
see
what
became
of
the
gallowsman
but
climbed
on
his
horse
with
what
speed
he
might
and
rode
away
at
full
gallop
neither
did
he
dare
go
back
by
the
way
he
came
fearing
to
face
black
barrow
down
therefore
he
struck
up
the
other
track
leading
away
towards
cloven
rocks
and
after
riding
hard
for
an
hour
and
drinking
all
his
whisky
he
luckily
fell
in
with
a
shepherd
who
led
him
on
to
a
publichouse
somewhere
near
exeford
and
here
he
was
so
unmanned
the
excitement
being
over
that
nothing
less
than
a
gallon
of
ale
and
half
a
gammon
of
bacon
brought
him
to
his
right
mind
again
and
he
took
good
care
to
be
home
before
dark
having
followed
a
wellknown
sheep
track
when
john
fry
finished
his
story
at
last
after
many
exclamations
from
annie
and
from
lizzie
and
much
praise
of
his
gallantry
yet
some
little
disappointment
that
he
had
not
stayed
there
a
little
longer
while
he
was
about
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
tell
us
more
i
said
to
him
very
sternly
now
john
you
have
dreamed
half
this
my
man
i
firmly
believe
that
you
fell
asleep
at
the
top
of
the
black
combe
after
drinking
all
your
whisky
and
never
went
on
the
moor
at
all
you
know
what
a
liar
you
are
john
the
girls
were
exceedingly
angry
at
this
and
laid
their
hands
before
my
mouth
but
i
waited
for
john
to
answer
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
him
steadfastly
baint
for
me
to
denai
said
john
looking
at
me
very
honestly
but
what
a
maight
tull
a

and
awhiles

a

this
naight
the
better
i
believe
you
speak
the
truth
john
and
i
ask
your
pardon
now
not
a
word
to
any
one
about
this
strange
affair
there
is
mischief
brewing
i
can
see
and
it
is
my
place
to
attend
to
it
several
things
come
across
me
nowonly
i
will
not
tell
you
they
were
not
at
all
contented
with
this
but
i
would
give
them
no
better
except
to
say
when
they
plagued
me
greatly
and
vowed
to
sleep
at
my
door
all
night
now
my
dears
this
is
foolish
of
you
too
much
of
this
matter
is
known
already
it
is
for
your
own
dear
sakes
that
i
am
bound
to
be
cautious
i
have
an
opinion
of
my
own
but
it
may
be
a
very
wrong
one
i
will
not
ask
you
to
share
it
with
me
neither
will
i
make
you
inquisitive
annie
pouted
and
lizzie
frowned
and
ruth
looked
at
me
with
her
eyes
wide
open
but
no
other
mark
of
regarding
me
and
i
saw
that
if
any
one
of
the
three
for
john
fry
was
gone
home
with
the
trembles
could
be
trusted
to
keep
a
secret

chapter

feeding
of
the
pigs
the
story
told
by
john
fry
that
night
and
my
conviction
of
its
truth
made
me
very
uneasy
especially
as
following
upon
the
warning
of
judge
jeffreys
and
the
hints
received
from
jeremy
stickles
and
the
outburst
of
the
tanner
at
dunster
as
well
as
sundry
tales
and
rumours
and
signs
of
secret
understanding
seen
and
heard
on
marketdays
and
at
places
of
entertainment
we
knew
for
certain
that
at
taunton
bridgwater
and
even
dulverton
there
was
much
disaffection
towards
the
king
and
regret
for
the
days
of
the
puritans
albeit
i
had
told
the
truth
and
the
pure
and
simple
truth
when
upon
my
examination
i
had
assured
his
lordship
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
with
us
but
now
i
was
beginning
to
doubt
whether
i
might
not
have
been
mistaken
especially
when
we
heard
as
we
did
of
arms
being
landed
at
lynmouth
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
of
the
tramp
of
men
having
reached
some
ones
ears
from
a
hill
where
a
famous
echo
was
for
it
must
be
plain
to
any
conspirator
without
the
example
of
the
doones
that
for
the
secret
muster
of
men
and
the
stowing
of
unlawful
arms
and
communication
by
beacon
lights
scarcely
a
fitter
place
could
be
found
than
the
wilds
of
exmoor
with
deep
ravines
running
far
inland
from
an
unwatched
and
mostly
a
sheltered
sea
for
the
channel
from
countisbury
foreland
up
to
minehead
or
even
farther
though
rocky
and
gusty
and
full
of
currents
is
safe
from
great
rollers
and
the
sweeping
power
of
the
southwest
storms
which
prevail
with
us
more
than
all
the
others
and
make
sad
work
on
the
opposite
coast
but
even
supposing
it
probable
that
something
against
king
charles
the
second
or
rather
against
his
roman
advisers
and
especially
his
brother
were
now
in
preparation
amongst
us
was
it
likely
that
master
huckaback
a
wealthy
man
and
a
careful
one
known
moreover
to
the
lord
chief
justice
would
have
anything
to
do
with
it
to
this
i
could
make
no
answer
uncle
ben
was
so
close
a
man
so
avaricious
and
so
revengeful
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
say
what
course
he
might
pursue
without
knowing
all
the
chances
of
gain
or
rise
or
satisfaction
to
him
that
he
hated
the
papists
i
knew
full
well
though
he
never
spoke
much
about
them
also
that
he
had
followed
the
march
of
oliver
cromwells
army
but
more
as
a
suttler
people
said
than
as
a
real
soldier
and
that
he
would
go
a
long
way
and
risk
a
great
deal
of
money
to
have
his
revenge
on
the
doones
although
their
name
never
passed
his
lips
during
the
present
visit
but
how
was
it
likely
to
be
as
to
the
doones
themselves
which
side
would
they
probably
take
in
the
coming
movement
if
movement
indeed
it
would
be
so
far
as
they
had
any
religion
at
all
by
birth
they
were
roman
catholicsso
much
i
knew
from
lorna
and
indeed
it
was
well
known
all
around
that
a
priest
had
been
fetched
more
than
once
to
the
valley
to
soothe
some
poor
outlaws
departure
on
the
other
hand
they
were
not
likely
to
entertain
much
affection
for
the
son
of
the
man
who
had
banished
them
and
confiscated
their
property
and
it
was
not
at
all
impossible
that
desperate
men
such
as
they
were
having
nothing
to
lose
but
estates
to
recover
and
not
being
held
by
religion
much
should
cast
away
all
regard
for
the
birth
from
which
they
had
been
cast
out
and
make
common
cause
with
a
protestant
rising
for
the
chance
of
revenge
and
replacement
however
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
these
things
occurred
to
me
as
clearly
as
i
have
set
them
down
only
that
i
was
in
general
doubt
and
very
sad
perplexity
for
mother
was
so
warm
and
innocent
and
kind
so
to
every
one
that
knowing
some
little
by
this
time
of
the
english
constitution
i
feared
very
greatly
lest
she
should
be
punished
for
harbouring
malcontents
as
well
as
possible
i
knew
that
if
any
poor
man
came
to
our
door
and
cried
officers
are
after
me
for
gods
sake
take
and
hide
me
mother
would
take
him
in
at
once
and
conceal
and
feed
him
even
though
he
had
been
very
violent
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
would
both
my
sisters
and
so
indeed
would
i
do
whence
it
will
be
clear
that
we
were
not
the
sort
of
people
to
be
safe
among
disturbances
before
i
could
quite
make
up
my
mind
how
to
act
in
this
difficulty
and
how
to
get
at
the
rights
of
it
for
i
would
not
spy
after
uncle
reuben
though
i
felt
no
great
fear
of
the
wizards
slough
and
none
of
the
man
with
the
white
nightcap
a
difference
came
again
upon
it
and
a
change
of
chances
for
uncle
ben
went
away
as
suddenly
as
he
first
had
come
to
us
giving
no
reason
for
his
departure
neither
claiming
the
pony
and
indeed
leaving
something
behind
him
of
great
value
to
my
mother
for
he
begged
her
to
see
to
his
young
granddaughter
until
he
could
find
opportunity
of
fetching
her
safely
to
dulverton
mother
was
overjoyed
at
this
as
she
could
not
help
displaying
and
ruth
was
quite
as
much
delighted
although
she
durst
not
show
it
for
at
dulverton
she
had
to
watch
and
keep
such
ward
on
the
victuals
and
the
in
and
out
of
the
shopmen
that
it
went
entirely
against
her
heart
and
she
never
could
enjoy
herself
truly
she
was
an
altered
girl
from
the
day
she
came
to
us
catching
our
unsuspicious
manners
and
our
free
goodwill
and
hearty
noise
of
laughing
by
this
time
the
harvest
being
done
and
the
thatching
of
the
ricks
made
sure
against
southwestern
tempests
and
all
the
reapers
being
gone
with
good
money
and
thankfulness
i
began
to
burn
in
spirit
for
the
sight
of
lorna
i
had
begged
my
sister
annie
to
let
sally
snowe
know
once
for
all
that
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
have
any
thing
more
to
do
with
her
of
course
our
annie
was
not
to
grieve
sally
neither
to
let
it
appear
for
a
moment
that
i
suspected
her
kind
views
upon
me
and
her
strong
regard
for
our
dairy
only
i
thought
it
right
upon
our
part
not
to
waste
sallys
time
any
longer
being
a
handsome
wench
as
she
was
and
many
young
fellows
glad
to
marry
her
and
annie
did
this
uncommonly
well
as
she
herself
told
me
afterwards
having
taken
sally
in
the
sweetest
manner
into
her
pure
confidence
and
opened
half
her
bosom
to
her
about
my
very
sad
love
affair
not
that
she
let
sally
know
of
course
who
it
was
or
what
it
was
only
that
she
made
her
understand
without
hinting
at
any
desire
of
it
that
there
was
no
chance
now
of
having
me
sally
changed
colour
a
little
at
this
and
then
went
on
about
a
red
cow
which
had
passed
seven
needles
at
milking
time
inasmuch
as
there
are
two
sorts
of
month
well
recognised
by
the
calendar
to
wit
the
lunar
and
the
solar
i
made
bold
to
regard
both
my
months
in
the
absence
of
any
provision
as
intended
to
be
strictly
lunar
therefore
upon
the
very
day
when
the
eight
weeks
were
expiring
forth
i
went
in
search
of
lorna
taking
the
pearl
ring
hopefully
and
all
the
newlaid
eggs
i
could
find
and
a
dozen
and
a
half
of
small
trout
from
our
brook
and
the
pleasure
it
gave
me
to
catch
those
trout
thinking
as
every
one
came
forth
and
danced
upon
the
grass
how
much
she
would
enjoy
him
is
more
than
i
can
now
describe
although
i
well
remember
it
and
it
struck
me
that
after
accepting
my
ring
and
saying
how
much
she
loved
me
it
was
possible
that
my
queen
might
invite
me
even
to
stay
and
sup
with
her
and
so
i
arranged
with
dear
annie
beforehand
who
was
now
the
greatest
comfort
to
me
to
account
for
my
absence
if
i
should
be
late
but
alas
i
was
utterly
disappointed
for
although
i
waited
and
waited
for
hours
with
an
equal
amount
both
of
patience
and
peril
no
lorna
ever
appeared
at
all
nor
even
the
faintest
sign
of
her
and
another
thing
occurred
as
well
which
vexed
me
more
than
it
need
have
done
for
so
small
a
matter
and
this
was
that
my
little
offering
of
the
trout
and
the
newlaid
eggs
was
carried
off
in
the
coolest
manner
by
that
vile
carver
doone
for
thinking
to
keep
them
the
fresher
and
nicer
away
from
so
much
handling
i
laid
them
in
a
little
bed
of
reeds
by
the
side
of
the
water
and
placed
some
dogleaves
over
them
and
when
i
had
quite
forgotten
about
them
and
was
watching
from
my
hidingplace
beneath
the
willowtree
for
i
liked
not
to
enter
lornas
bower
without
her
permission
except
just
to
peep
that
she
was
not
there
and
while
i
was
turning
the
ring
in
my
pocket
having
just
seen
the
new
moon
i
became
aware
of
a
great
man
coming
eisurely
down
the
valley
he
had
a
broadbrimmed
hat
and
a
leather
jerkin
and
heavy
jackboots
to
his
middle
thigh
and
what
was
worst
of
all
for
me
on
his
shoulder
he
bore
a
long
carbine
having
nothing
to
meet
him
withal
but
my
staff
and
desiring
to
avoid
disturbance
i
retired
promptly
into
the
chasm
keeping
the
tree
betwixt
us
that
he
might
not
descry
me
and
watching
from
behind
the
jut
of
a
rock
where
now
i
had
scraped
myself
a
neat
little
hole
for
the
purpose
presently
the
great
man
reappeared
being
now
within
fifty
yards
of
me
and
the
light
still
good
enough
as
he
drew
nearer
for
me
to
descry
his
features
and
though
i
am
not
a
judge
of
mens
faces
there
was
something
in
his
which
turned
me
cold
as
though
with
a
kind
of
horror
not
that
it
was
an
ugly
face
nay
rather
it
seemed
a
handsome
one
so
far
as
mere
form
and
line
might
go
full
of
strength
and
vigour
and
will
and
steadfast
resolution
from
the
short
black
hair
above
the
broad
forehead
to
the
long
black
beard
descending
below
the
curt
bold
chin
there
was
not
any
curve
or
glimpse
of
weakness
or
of
afterthought
nothing
playful
nothing
pleasant
nothing
with
a
track
of
smiles
nothing
which
a
friend
could
like
and
laugh
at
him
for
having
and
yet
he
might
have
been
a
good
man
for
i
have
known
very
good
men
so
fortified
by
their
own
strange
ideas
of
god
i
say
that
he
might
have
seemed
a
good
man
but
for
the
cold
and
cruel
hankering
of
his
steelblue
eyes
now
let
no
one
suppose
for
a
minute
that
i
saw
all
this
in
a
moment
for
i
am
very
slow
and
take
a
long
time
to
digest
things
only
i
like
to
set
down
and
have
done
with
it
all
the
results
of
my
knowledge
though
they
be
not
manifold
but
what
i
said
to
myself
just
then
was
no
more
than
this
what
a
fellow
to
have
lorna
having
my
sense
of
right
so
outraged
although
of
course
i
would
never
allow
her
to
go
so
far
as
that
i
almost
longed
that
he
might
thrust
his
head
in
to
look
after
me
for
there
i
was
with
my
ash
staff
clubbed
ready
to
have
at
him
and
not
ill
inclined
to
do
so
if
only
he
would
come
where
strength
not
firearms
must
decide
it
however
he
suspected
nothing
of
my
dangerous
neighbourhood
but
walked
his
round
like
a
sentinel
and
turned
at
the
brink
of
the
water
then
as
he
marched
back
again
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
he
espied
my
little
hoard
covered
up
with
dogleaves
he
saw
that
the
leaves
were
upside
down
and
this
of
course
drew
his
attention
i
saw
him
stoop
and
lay
bare
the
fish
and
the
eggs
set
a
little
way
from
them
and
in
my
simple
heart
i
thought
that
now
he
knew
all
about
me
but
to
my
surprise
he
seemed
wellpleased
and
his
harsh
short
laughter
came
to
me
without
echo
ha
ha
charlie
boy
fisherman
charlie
have
i
caught
thee
setting
bait
for
lorna
now
i
understand
thy
fishings
and
the
robbing
of
counsellors
hen
roost
may
i
never
have
good
roasting
if
i
have
it
not
tonight
and
roast
thee
charlie
afterwards
with
this
he
calmly
packed
up
my
fish
and
all
the
best
of
dear
annies
eggs
and
went
away
chuckling
steadfastly
to
his
home
if
one
may
call
it
so
but
i
was
so
thoroughly
grieved
and
mortified
by
this
most
impudent
robbery
that
i
started
forth
from
my
rocky
screen
with
the
intention
of
pursuing
him
until
my
better
sense
arrested
me
barely
in
time
to
escape
his
eyes
for
i
said
to
myself
that
even
supposing
i
could
contend
unarmed
with
him
it
would
be
the
greatest
folly
in
the
world
to
have
my
secret
access
known
and
perhaps
a
fatal
barrier
placed
between
lorna
and
myself
and
i
knew
not
what
trouble
brought
upon
her
all
for
the
sake
of
a
few
eggs
and
fishes
it
was
better
to
bear
this
trifling
loss
however
ignominious
and
goading
to
the
spirit
than
to
risk
my
love
and
lornas
welfare
and
perhaps
be
shot
into
the
bargain
and
i
think
that
all
will
agree
with
me
that
i
acted
for
the
wisest
in
withdrawing
to
my
shelter
though
deprived
of
eggs
and
fishes
having
waited
as
i
said
until
there
was
no
chance
whatever
of
my
love
appearing
i
hastened
homeward
very
sadly
and
the
wind
of
early
autumn
moaned
across
the
moorland
all
the
beauty
of
the
harvest
all
the
gaiety
was
gone
and
the
early
fall
of
dusk
was
like
a
weight
upon
me
nevertheless
i
went
every
evening
thenceforward
for
a
fortnight
hoping
every
time
in
vain
to
find
my
hope
and
comfort
and
meanwhile
what
perplexed
me
most
was
that
the
signals
were
replaced
in
order
as
agreed
upon
so
that
lorna
could
scarcely
be
restrained
by
any
rigour
one
time
i
had
a
narrow
chance
of
being
shot
and
settled
with
and
it
befell
me
thus
i
was
waiting
very
carelessly
being
now
a
little
desperate
at
the
entrance
to
the
glen
instead
of
watching
through
my
sighthole
as
the
proper
practice
was
suddenly
a
ball
went
by
me
with
a
whizz
and
whistle
passing
through
my
hat
and
sweeping
it
away
all
folded
up
my
soft
hat
fluttered
far
down
the
stream
before
i
had
time
to
go
after
it
and
with
the
help
of
both
wind
and
water
was
fifty
yards
gone
in
a
moment
at
this
i
had
just
enough
mind
left
to
shrink
back
very
suddenly
and
lurk
very
still
and
closely
for
i
knew
what
a
narrow
escape
it
had
been
as
i
heard
the
bullet
hard
set
by
the
powder
sing
mournfully
down
the
chasm
like
a
drone
banished
out
of
the
hive
and
as
i
peered
through
my
little
cranny
i
saw
a
wreath
of
smoke
still
floating
where
the
thickness
was
of
the
withybed
and
presently
carver
doone
came
forth
having
stopped
to
reload
his
piece
perhaps
and
ran
very
swiftly
to
the
entrance
to
see
what
he
had
shot
sore
trouble
had
i
to
keep
close
quarters
from
the
slipperiness
of
the
stone
beneath
me
with
the
water
sliding
over
it
my
foe
came
quite
to
the
verge
of
the
fall
where
the
river
began
to
comb
over
and
there
he
stopped
for
a
minute
or
two
on
the
utmost
edge
of
dry
land
upon
the
very
spot
indeed
where
i
had
fallen
senseless
when
i
clomb
it
in
my
boyhood
i
could
hear
him
breathing
hard
and
grunting
as
in
doubt
and
discontent
for
he
stood
within
a
yard
of
me
and
i
kept
my
right
fist
ready
for
him
if
he
should
discover
me
then
at
the
foot
of
the
waterslide
my
black
hat
suddenly
appeared
tossing
in
white
foam
and
fluttering
like
a
raven
wounded
now
i
had
doubted
which
hat
to
take
when
i
left
home
that
day
till
i
thought
that
the
black
became
me
best
and
might
seem
kinder
to
lorna
have
i
killed
thee
old
bird
at
last
my
enemy
cried
in
triumph
tis
the
third
time
i
have
shot
at
thee
and
thou
wast
beginning
to
mock
me
no
more
of
thy
cursed
croaking
now
to
wake
me
in
the
morning
ha
ha
there
are
not
many
who
get
three
chances
from
carver
doone
and
none
ever
go
beyond
it
i
laughed
within
myself
at
this
as
he
strode
away
in
his
triumph
for
was
not
this
his
third
chance
of
me
and
he
no
whit
the
wiser
and
then
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
chance
might
some
day
be
on
the
other
side
for
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
heartily
tired
of
lurking
and
playing
bopeep
so
long
to
which
nothing
could
have
reconciled
me
except
my
fear
for
lorna
and
here
i
saw
was
a
man
of
strength
fit
for
me
to
encounter
such
as
i
had
never
met
but
would
be
glad
to
meet
with
having
found
no
man
of
late
who
needed
not
my
mercy
at
wrestling
or
at
singlestick
and
growing
more
and
more
uneasy
as
i
found
no
lorna
i
would
have
tried
to
force
the
doone
glen
from
the
upper
end
and
take
my
chance
of
getting
back
but
for
annie
and
her
prayers
now
that
same
night
i
think
it
was
or
at
any
rate
the
next
one
that
i
noticed
betty
muxworthy
going
on
most
strangely
she
made
the
queerest
signs
to
me
when
nobody
was
looking
and
laid
her
fingers
on
her
lips
and
pointed
over
her
shoulder
but
i
took
little
heed
of
her
being
in
a
kind
of
dudgeon
and
oppressed
with
evil
luck
believing
too
that
all
she
wanted
was
to
have
some
little
grumble
about
some
petty
grievance
but
presently
she
poked
me
with
the
heel
of
a
firebundle
and
passing
close
to
my
ear
whispered
so
that
none
else
could
hear
her
larna
dooun
by
these
words
i
was
so
startled
that
i
turned
round
and
stared
at
her
but
she
pretended
not
to
know
it
and
began
with
all
her
might
to
scour
an
empty
crock
with
a
besom
oh
betty
let
me
help
you
that
work
is
much
too
hard
for
you
i
cried
with
a
sudden
chivalry
which
only
won
rude
answer
zeed
me
adooing
of
thic
every
naight
last
ten
year
jan
wiout
vindin
out
how
hard
it
wor
but
if

thee

to

for
me
massy
if
i
aint
forgotten
to
fade
the
pegs
till
now
favouring
me
with
another
wink
to
which
i
now
paid
the
keenest
heed
betty
went
and
fetched
the
lanthorn
from
the
hook
inside
the
door
then
when
she
had
kindled
it
not
allowing
me
any
time
to
ask
what
she
was
after
she
went
outside
and
pointed
to
the
great
bock
of
wash
and
riddlings
and
brown
hulkage
for
we
ground
our
own
corn
always
and
though
she
knew
that
bill
dadds
and
jem
slocombe
had
full
work
to
carry
it
on
a
pole
with
another
to
help
to
sling
it
she
said
to
me
as
quietly
as
a
maiden
might
ask
one
to
carry
a
glove
jan
ridd
carr
thic
thing
for
me
so
i
carried
it
for
her
without
any
words
wondering
what
she
was
up
to
next
and
whether
she
had
ever
heard
of
being
too
hard
on
the
willing
horse
and
when
we
came
to
hogpound
she
turned
upon
me
suddenly
with
the
lanthorn
she
was
bearing
and
saw
that
i
had
the
bock
by
one
hand
very
easily
jan
ridd
she
said
there
be
no
other
man
in
england
cud
a
dood
it
now
thee
shalt
have
larna
while
i
was
wondering
how
my
chance
of
having
lorna
could
depend
upon
my
power
to
carry
pigs
wash
and
how
betty
could
have
any
voice
in
the
matter
which
seemed
to
depend
upon
her
decision
and
in
short
while
i
was
all
abroad
as
to
her
knowledge
and
everything
the
pigs
who
had
been
fast
asleep
and
dreaming
in
their
emptiness
awoke
with
one
accord
at
the
goodness
of
the
smell
around
them
they
had
resigned
themselves
as
even
pigs
do
to
a
kind
of
fast
hoping
to
break
their
fast
more
sweetly
on
the
morrow
morning
but
now
they
tumbled
out
all
headlong
pigs
below
and
pigs
above
pigs
pointblank
and
pigs
across
pigs
courant
and
pigs
rampant
but
all
alike
prepared
to
eat
and
all
in
good
cadence
squeaking
tak
smarl
boocket
and
bale
un
out
wad
e
waste
sich
stoof
as
thic
here
be
so
betty
set
me
to
feed
the
pigs
while
she
held
the
lanthorn
and
knowing
what
she
was
i
saw
that
she
would
not
tell
me
another
word
until
all
the
pigs
were
served
and
in
truth
no
man
could
well
look
at
them
and
delay
to
serve
them
they
were
all
expressing
appetite
in
so
forcible
a
manner
some
running
to
and
fro
and
rubbing
and
squealing
as
if
from
starvation
some
rushing
down
to
the
oaken
troughs
and
poking
each
other
away
from
them
and
the
kindest
of
all
putting
up
their
forefeet
on
the
toprail
on
the
hogpound
and
blinking
their
little
eyes
and
grunting
prettily
to
coax
us
as
who
would
say
i
trust
you
now

will
be

betty
held
the
lanthorn
up
and
defied
me
to
deny
it
and
the
light
through
the
horn
showed
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
such
as
i
had
never
seer

before
no

chaste
salute
with
all
the
pigs
for
witnesses
and
she
took
it
not
amiss
considering
how
long
she
had
been
out
of
practice
but
then
she
fell
back
like
a
broom
on
its
handle
and
stared
at
me
feigning
anger

chapter
xxxiii
an
early
morning
call
of
course
i
was
up
the
very
next
morning
before
the
october
sunrise
and
away
through
the
wild
and
the
woodland
towards
the
bagworthy
water
at
the
foot
of
the
long
cascade
the
rising
of
the
sun
was
noble
in
the
cold
and
warmth
of
it
peeping
down
the
spread
of
light
he
raised
his
shoulder
heavily
over
the
edge
of
grey
mountain
and
wavering
length
of
upland
beneath
his
gaze
the
dewfogs
dipped
and
crept
to
the
hollow
places
then
stole
away
in
line
and
column
holding
skirts
and
clinging
subtly
at
the
sheltering
corners
where
rock
hung
over
grassland
while
the
brave
lines
of
the
hills
came
forth
one
beyond
other
gliding
then
the
woods
arose
in
folds
like
drapery
of
awakened
mountains
stately
with
a
depth
of
awe
and
memory
of
the
tempests
autumns
mellow
hand
was
on
them
as
they
owned
already
touched
with
gold
and
red
and
olive
and
their
joy
towards
the
sun
was
less
to
a
bridegroom
than
a
father
yet
before
the
floating
impress
of
the
woods
could
clear
itself
suddenly
the
gladsome
light
leaped
over
hill
and
valley
casting
amber
blue
and
purple
and
a
tint
of
rich
red
rose
according
to
the
scene
they
lit
on
and
the
curtain
flung
around
yet
all
alike
dispelling
fear
and
the
cloven
hoof
of
darkness
all
on
the
wings
of
hope
advancing
and
proclaiming
god
is
here
then
life
and
joy
sprang
reassured
from
every
crouching
hollow
every
flower
and
bud
and
bird
had
a
fluttering
sense
of
them
and
all
the
flashing
of
gods
gaze
merged
into
soft
beneficence
so
perhaps
shall
break
upon
us
that
eternal
morning
when
crag
and
chasm
shall
be
no
more
neither
hill
and
valley
nor
great
unvintaged
ocean
when
glory
shall
not
scare
happiness
neither
happiness
envy
glory
but
all
things
shall
arise
and
shine
in
the
light
of
the
fathers
countenance
because
itself
is
risen
who
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
upon
both
the
just
and
the
unjust
and
surely
but
for
the
saving
clause
doone
glen
had
been
in
darkness
now
as
i
stood
with
scanty
breathfor
few
men
could
have
won
that
climbat
the
top
of
the
long
defile
and
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
gorge
all
of
myself
and
the
pain
of
it
and
the
cark
of
my
discontent
fell
away
into
wonder
and
rapture
for
i
cannot
help
seeing
things
now
and
then
slowwitted
as
i
have
a
right
to
be
and
perhaps
because
it
comes
so
rarely
the
sight
dwells
with
me
like
a
picture
the
bar
of
rock
with
the
watercleft
breaking
steeply
through
it
stood
bold
and
bare
and
dark
in
shadow
grey
with
red
gullies
down
it
but
the
sun
was
beginning
to
glisten
over
the
comb
of
the
eastern
highland
and
through
an
archway
of
the
wood
hung
with
old
nests
and
ivy
the
lines
of
many
a
leaning
tree
were
thrown
from
the
cliffs
of
the
foreland
down
upon
the
sparkling
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
western
crags
and
through
the
dewy
meadows
breast
fringed
with
shade
but
touched
on
one
side
with
the
sunsmile
ran
the
crystal
water
curving
in
its
brightness
like
diverted
hope
on
either
bank
the
blades
of
grass
making
their
last
autumn
growth
pricked
their
spears
and
crisped
their
tuftings
with
the
pearly
purity
the
tenderness
of
their
green
appeared
under
the
glaucous
mantle
while
that
grey
suffusion
which
is
the
blush
of
green
life
spread
its
damask
chastity
even
then
my
soul
was
lifted
worried
though
my
mind
was
who
can
see
such
large
kind
doings
and
not
be
ashamed
of
human
grief
not
only
unashamed
of
grief
but
much
abashed
with
joy
was
i
when
i
saw
my
lorna
coming
purer
than
the
morning
dew
than
the
sun
more
bright
and
clear
that
which
made
me
love
her
so
that
which
lifted
my
heart
to
her
as
the
spring
wind
lifts
the
clouds
was
the
gayness
of
her
nature
and
its
inborn
playfulness
and
yet
all
this
with
maiden
shame
a
conscious
dream
of
things
unknown
and
a
sense
of
fate
about
them
down
the
valley
still
she
came
not
witting
that
i
looked
at
her
having
ceased
through
my
own
misprison
to
expect
me
yet
awhile
or
at
least
she
told
herself
so
in
the
joy
of
awakened
life
and
brightness
of
the
morning
she
had
cast
all
care
away
and
seemed
to
float
upon
the
sunrise
like
a
buoyant
silver
wave
suddenly
at
sight
of
me
for
i
leaped
forth
at
once
in
fear
of
seeming
to
watch
her
unawares
the
bloom
upon
her
cheeks
was
deepened
and
the
radiance
of
her
eyes
and
she
came
to
meet
me
gladly
at
last
then
you
are
come
john
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
me
i
could
not
make
you
understandthey
have
kept
me
prisoner
every
evening
but
come
into
my
house
you
are
in
danger
here
meanwhile
i
could
not
answer
being
overcome
with
joy
but
followed
to
her
little
grotto
where
i
had
been
twice
before
i
knew
that
the
crowning
moment
of
my
life
was
comingthat
lorna
would
own
her
love
for
me
she
made
for
awhile
as
if
she
dreamed
not
of
the
meaning
of
my
gaze
but
tried
to
speak
of
other
things
faltering
now
and
then
and
mantling
with
a
richer
damask
below
her
long
eyelashes
this
is
not
what
i
came
to
know
i
whispered
very
softly
you
know
what
i
am
come
to
ask
if
you
are
come
on
purpose
to
ask
anything
why
do
you
delay
so
she
turned
away
very
bravely
but
i
saw
that
her
lips
were
trembling
i
delay
so
long
because
i
fear
because
my
whole
life
hangs
in
balance
on
a
single
word
because
what
i
have
near
me
now
may
never
more
be
near
me
after
though
more
than
all
the
world
or
than
a
thousand
worlds
to
me
as
i
spoke
these
words
of
passion
in
a
low
soft
voice
lorna
trembled
more
and
more
but
she
made
no
answer
neither
yet
looked
up
at
me
i
have
loved
you
long
and
long
i
pursued
being
reckless
now
when
you
were
a
little
child
as
a
boy
i
worshipped
you
then
when
i
saw
you
a
comely
girl
as
a
stripling
i
adored
you
now
that
you
are
a
fullgrown
maiden
all
the
rest
i
do
and
morei
love
you
more
than
tongue
can
tell
or
heart
can
hold
in
silence
i
have
waited
long
and
long
and
though
i
am
so
far
below
you
i
can
wait
no
longer
but
must
have
my
answer
you
have
been
very
faithful
john
she
murmured
to
the
fern
and
moss
i
suppose
i
must
reward
you
that
will
not
do
for
me
i
said
i
will
not
have
reluctant
liking
nor
assent
for
pitys
sake
which
only
means
endurance
i
must
have
all
love
or
none
i
must
have
your
heart
of
hearts
even
as
you
have
mine
lorna
while
i
spoke
she
glanced
up
shyly
through
her
fluttering
lashes
to
prolong
my
doubt
one
moment
for
her
own
delicious
pride
then
she
opened
wide
upon
me
all
the
glorious
depth
and
softness
of
her
loving
eyes
and
flung
both
arms
around
my
neck
and
answered
with
her
heart
on
mine
darling
you
have
won
it
all
i
shall
never
be
my
own
again
i
am
yours
my
own
one
for
ever
and
for
ever
i
am
sure
i
know
not
what
i
did
or
what
i
said
thereafter
being
overcome
with
transport
by
her
words
and
at
her
gaze
only
one
thing
i
remember
when
she
raised
her
bright
lips
to
me
like
a
child
for
me
to
kiss
such
a
smile
of
sweet
temptation
met
me
through
her
flowing
hair
that
i
almost
forgot
my
manners
giving
her
no
time
to
breathe
that
will
do
said
lorna
gently
but
violently
blushing
for
the
present
that
will
do
john
and
now
remember
one
thing
dear
all
the
kindness
is
to
be
on
my
side
and
you
are
to
be
very
distant
as
behoves
to
a
young
maiden
except
when
i
invite
you
but
you
may
kiss
my
hand
john
oh
yes
you
may
kiss
my
hand
you
know
ah
to
be
sure
i
had
forgotten
how
very
stupid
of
me
for
by
this
time
i
had
taken
one
sweet
hand
and
gazed
on
it
with
the
pride
of
all
the
world
to
think
that
such
a
lovely
thing
was
mine
and
then
i
slipped
my
little
ring
upon
the
wedding
finger
and
this
time
lorna
kept
it
and
looked
with
fondness
on
its
beauty
and
clung
to
me
with
a
flood
of
tears
every
time
you
cry
said
i
drawing
her
closer
to
me
i
shall
consider
it
an
invitation
not
to
be
too
distant
there
now
none
shall
make
you
weep
darling
you
shall
sigh
no
more
but
live
in
peace
and
happiness
with
me
to
guard
and
cherish
you
and
who
shall
dare
to
vex
you
but
she
drew
a
long
sad
sigh
and
looked
at
the
ground
with
the
great
tears
rolling
and
pressed
one
hand
upon
the
trouble
of
her
pure
young
breast
it
can
never
never
be
she
murmured
to
herself
alone
who
am
i
to
dream
of
it
something
in
my
heart
tells
me
it
can
be
so
never
never

xxxiv
two
negatives
make
an
affirmative
there
was
however
no
possibility
of
depressing
me
at
such
a
time
to
be
loved
by
lorna
the
sweet
the
pure
the
playful
one
the
fairest
creature
on
gods
earth
and
the
most
enchanting
the
lady
of
high
birth
and
mind
that
i
a
mere
clumsy
blundering
yeoman
without
wit
or
wealth
or
lineage
should
have
won
that
loving
heart
to
be
my
own
for
ever
was
a
thought
no
fears
could
lessen
and
no
chance
could
steal
from
me
therefore
at
her
own
entreaty
taking
a
very
quick
adieu
and
by
her
own
invitation
an
exceeding
kind
one
i
hurried
home
with
deep
exulting
yet
some
sad
misgivings
for
lorna
had
made
me
promise
now
to
tell
my
mother
everything
as
indeed
i
always
meant
to
do
when
my
suit
should
be
gone
too
far
to
stop
i
knew
of
course
that
my
dear
mother
would
be
greatly
moved
and
vexed
the
heirship
of
glen
doone
not
being
a
very
desirable
dower
but
in
spite
of
that
and
all
disappointment
as
to
little
ruth
huckaback
feeling
my
mothers
tenderness
and
deep
affection
to
me
and
forgiving
nature
i
doubted
not
that
before
very
long
she
would
view
the
matter
as
i
did
moreover
i
felt
that
if
once
i
could
get
her
only
to
look
at
lorna
she
would
so
love
and
glory
in
her
that
i
should
obtain
all
praise
and
thanks
perchance
without
deserving
them
unluckily
for
my
designs
who
should
be
sitting
down
at
breakfast
with
my
mother
and
the
rest
but
squire
faggus
as
everybody
now
began
to
entitle
him
i
noticed
something
odd
about
him
something
uncomfortable
in
his
manner
and
a
lack
of
that
ease
and
humour
which
had
been
wont
to
distinguish
him
he
took
his
breakfast
as
it
came
without
a
single
joke
about
it
or
preference
of
this
to
that
but
with
sly
soft
looks
at
annie
who
seemed
unable
to
sit
quiet
or
to
look
at
any
one
steadfastly
i
feared
in
my
heart
what
was
coming
on
and
felt
truly
sorry
for
poor
mother
after
breakfast
it
became
my
duty
to
see
to
the
ploughing
of
a
barleystubble
ready
for
the
sowing
of
a
french
grass
and
i
asked
tom
faggus
to
come
with
me
but
he
refused
and
i
knew
the
reason
being
resolved
to
allow
him
fair
field
to
himself
though
with
great
displeasure
that
a
man
of
such
illegal
repute
should
marry
into
our
family
which
had
always
been
counted
so
honest
i
carried
my
dinner
upon
my
back
and
spent
the
whole
day
with
the
furrows
when
i
returned
squire
faggus
was
gone
which
appeared
to
me
but
a
sorry
sign
inasmuch
as
if
mother
had
taken
kindly
to
him
and
his
intentions
she
would
surely
have
made
him
remain
awhile
to
celebrate
the
occasion
and
presently
no
doubt
was
left
for
lizzie
came
running
to
meet
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
woodrick
and
cried
oh
john
there
is
such
a
business
mother
is
in
such
a
state
of
mind
and
annie
crying
her
eyes
out
what
do
you
think
you
would
never
guess
though
i
have
suspected
it
ever
so
long
no
need
for
me
to
guess
i
replied
as
though
with
some
indifference
because
of
her
selfimportant
air
i
knew
all
about
it
long
ago
you
have
not
been
crying
much
i
see
i
should
like
you
better
if
you
had
why
should
i
cry
i
like
tom
faggus
he
is
the
only
one
i
ever
see
with
the
spirit
of
a
man
this
was
a
cut
of
course
at
me
mr
faggus
had
won
the
goodwill
of
lizzie
by
his
hatred
of
the
doones
and
vows
that
if
he
could
get
a
dozen
men
of
any
courage
to
join
him
he
would
pull
their
stronghold
about
their
ears
without
any
more
ado
this
malice
of
his
seemed
strange
to
me
as
he
had
never
suffered
at
their
hands
so
far
at
least
as
i
knew
was
it
to
be
attributed
to
his
jealousy
of
outlaws
who
excelled
him
in
his
business
not
being
good
at
repartee
i
made
no
answer
to
lizzie
having
found
this
course
more
irksome
to
her
than
the
very
best
invective
and
so
we
entered
the
house
together
and
mother
sent
at
once
for
me
while
i
was
trying
to
console
my
darling
sister
annie
oh
john
speak
one
good
word
for
me
she
cried
with
both
hands
laid
in
mine
and
her
tearful
eyes
looking
up
at
me
not
one
my
pet
but
a
hundred
i
answered
kindly
embracing
her
have
no
fear
little
sister
i
am
going
to
make
your
case
so
bright
by
comparison
i
mean
that
mother
will
send
for
you
in
five
minutes
and
call
you
her
best
her
most
dutiful
child
and
praise
cousin
tom
to
the
skies
and
send
a
man
on
horseback
after
him
and
then
you
will
have
a
harder
task
to
intercede
for
me
my
dear
oh
john
dear
john
you
wont
tell
her
about
lornaoh
not
today
dear
yes
today
and
at
once
annie
i
want
to
have
it
over
and
be
done
with
it
oh
but
think
of
her
dear
i
am
sure
she
could
not
bear
it
after
this
great
shock
already
she
will
bear
it
all
the
better
said
i
the
one
will
drive
the
other
out
i
know
exactly
what
mother
is
she
will
be
desperately
savage
first
with
you
and
then
with
me
and
then
for
a
very
little
while
with
both
of
us
together
and
then
she
will
put
one
against
the
other
in
her
mind
i
mean
and
consider
which
was
most
to
blame
and
in
doing
that
she
will
be
compelled
to
find
the
best
in
eithers
case
that
it
may
beat
the
other
and
so
as
the
pleas
come
before
her
mind
they
will
gain
upon
the
charges
both
of
us
being
her
children
you
know
and
before
very
long
particularly
if
we
both
keep
out
of
the
way
she
will
begin
to
think
that
after
all
she
has
been
a
little
too
hasty
and
then
she
will
remember
how
good
we
have
always
been
to
her
and
how
like
our
father
upon
that
she
will
think
of
her
own
lovetime
and
sigh
a
good
bit
and
cry
a
little
and
then
smile
and
send
for
both
of
us
and
beg
our
pardon
and
call
us
her
two
darlings
now
john
how
on
earth
can
you
know
all
that
exclaimed
my
sister
wiping
her
eyes
and
gazing
at
me
with
a
soft
bright
smile
who
on
earth
can
have
told
you
john
people
to
call
you
stupid
indeed
why
i
feel
that
all
you
say
is
quite
true
because
you
describe
so
exactly
what
i
should
do
myself
i
meani
mean
if
i
had
two
children
who
had
behaved
as
we
have
done
but
tell
me
darling
john
how
you
learned
all
this
never
you
mind
i
replied
with
a
nod
of
some
conceit
i
fear
i
must
be
a
fool
if
i
did
not
know
what
mother
is
by
this
time
now
inasmuch
as
the
thing
befell
according
to
my
prediction
what
need
for
me
to
dwell
upon
it
after
saying
how
it
would
be
moreover
i
would
regret
to
write
down
what
mother
said
about
lorna
in
her
first
surprise
and
tribulation
not
only
because
i
was
grieved
by
the
gross
injustice
of
it
and
frightened
mother
with
her
own
words
repeated
deeply
after
her
but
rather
because
it
is
not
well
when
people
repent
of
hasty
speech
to
enter
it
against
them
that
is
said
to
be
the
angels
business
and
i
doubt
if
they
can
attend
to
it
much
without
doing
injury
to
themselves
however
by
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
began
to
go
down
upon
us
our
mother
sat
on
the
garden
bench
with
her
head
on
my
great
otterskin
waistcoat
which
was
waterproof
and
her
right
arm
round
our
annies
waist
and
scarcely
knowing
which
of
us
she
ought
to
make
the
most
of
or
which
deserved
most
pity
not
that
she
had
forgiven
yet
the
rivals
to
her
lovetom
faggus
i
mean
and
lornabut
that
she
was
beginning
to
think
a
tattle
better
of
them
now
and
a
vast
deal
better
of
her
own
children
and
it
helped
her
much
in
this
regard
that
she
was
not
thinking
half
so
well
as
usual
of
herself
or
rather
of
her
own
judgment
for
in
good
truth
she
had
no
self
only
as
it
came
home
to
her
by
no
very
distant
road
but
by
way
of
her
children
a
better
mother
never
lived
and
can
i
after
searching
all
things
add
another
word
to
that
and
indeed
poor
lizzie
was
not
so
very
bad
but
behaved
on
the
whole
very
well
for
her
she
was
much
to
be
pitied
poor
thing
and
great
allowances
made
for
her
as
belonging
to
a
wellgrown
family
and
a
very
comely
one
and
feeling
her
own
shortcomings
this
made
her
leap
to
the
other
extreme
and
reassert
herself
too
much
endeavouring
to
exalt
the
mind
at
the
expense
of
the
body
because
she
had
the
invisible
one
so
far
as
can
be
decided
in
better
share
than
the
visible

what
she
had
her
points
and
very
comely
points
of

and

beautiful
hands

almost
as
good
as

and
a
neck
as
white

but
lizzie
was
not
gifted
with
our
gait
and
port
and
bounding
health
now
while
we
sat
on
the
garden
bench
under
the
great
ashtree
we
left
dear
mother
to
take
her
own
way
and
talk
at
her
own
pleasure
children
almost
always
are
more
wideawake
than
their
parents
the
fathers
and
the
mothers
laugh
but
the
young
ones
have
the
best
of
them
and
now
both
annie
knew
and
i
that
we
had
gotten
the
best
of
mother
and
therefore
we
let
her
lay
down
the
law
as
if
we
had
been
two
dollies
darling
john
my
mother
said
your
case
is
a
very
hard
one
a
young
and
very
romantic
girlgod
send
that
i
be
right
in
my
charitable
view
of
herhas
met
an
equally
simple
boy
among
great
dangers
and
difficulties
from
which
my
son
has
saved
her
at
the
risk
of
his
life
at
every
step
of
course
she
became
attached
to
him
and
looked
up
to
him
in
every
way
as
a
superior
being
come
now
mother
i
said
if
you
only
saw
lorna
you
would
look
upon
me
as
the
lowest
dirt
no
doubt
i
should
my
mother
answered
and
the
king
and
queen
and
all
the
royal
family
well
this
poor
angel
having
made
up
her
mind
to
take
compassion
upon
my
son
when
he
had
saved
her
life
so
many
times
persuades
him
to
marry
her
out
of
pure
pity
and
throw
his
poor
mother
overboard
and
the
saddest
part
of
it
all
is
this
that
my
mother
will
never
never
never
understand
the
truth
said
i
that
is
all
i
wish
she
answered
just
to
get
at
the
simple
truth
from
my
own
perception
of
it
john
you
are
very
wise
in
kissing
me
but
perhaps
you
would
not
be
so
wise
in
bringing
lorna
for
an
afternoon
just
to
see
what
she
thinks
of
me
there
is
a
good
saddle
of
mutton
now
and
there
are
some
very
good
sausages
left
on
the
blue
dish
with
the
anchor
annie
from
the
last
little
sow
we
killed
as
if
lorna
would
eat
sausages
said
i
with
appearance
of
high
contempt
though
rejoicing
all
the
while
that
mother
seemed
to
have
her
name
so
pat
and
she
pronounced
it
in
a
manner
which
made
my
heart
leap
to
my
ears
lorna
to
eat
sausages
i
dont
see
why
she
shouldnt
my
mother
answered
smiling
if
she
means
to
be
a
farmers
wife
she
must
take
to
farmers
ways
i
think
what
do
you
say
annie
she
will
eat
whatever
john
desires
i
should
hope
said
annie
gravely
particularly
as
i
made
them
oh
that
i
could
only
get
the
chance
of
trying
her
i
answered
if
you
could
once
behold
her
mother
you
would
never
let
her
go
again
and
she
would
love
you
with
all
her
heart
she
is
so
good
and
gentle
that
is
a
lucky
thing
for
me
saying
this
my
mother
wept
as
she
had
been
doing
off
and
on
when
no
one
seemed
to
look
at
her
otherwise
i
suppose
john
she
would
very
soon
turn
me
out
of
the
farm
having
you
so
completely
under
her
thumb
as
she
seems
to
have
i
see
now
that
my
time
is
over
lizzie
and
i
will
seek
our
fortunes
it
is
wiser
so
now
mother
i
cried
will
you
have
the
kindness
not
to
talk
any
nonsense
everything
belongs
to
you
and
so
i
hope
your
children
do
and
you
in
turn
belong
to
us
as
you
have
proved
ever
sinceoh
ever
since
we
can
remember
why
do
you
make
annie
cry
so
you
ought
to
know
better
than
that
mother
upon
this
went
over
all
the
things
she
had
done
before
how
many
times
i
know
not
neither
does
it
matter
only
she
seemed
to
enjoy
it
more
every
time
of
doing
it
and
then
she
said
she
was
an
old
fool
and
annie
like
a
thorough
girl
pulled
her
one
grey
hair
out
chapter
xxxv
ruth
is
not
like
lorna
although
by
our
mothers
reluctant
consent
a
large
part
of
the
obstacles
between
annie
and
her
lover
appeared
to
be
removed
on
the
other
hand
lorna
and
myself
gained
little
except
as
regarded
comfort
of
mind
and
some
ease
to
the
conscience
moreover
our
chance
of
frequent
meetings
and
delightful
converse
was
much
impaired
at
least
for
the
present
because
though
mother
was
not
aware
of
my
narrow
escape
from
carver
doone
she
made
me
promise
never
to
risk
my
life
by
needless
visits
and
upon
this
point
that
is
to
say
the
necessity
of
the
visit
she
was
well
content
as
she
said
to
leave
me
to
my
own
good
sense
and
honour
only
begging
me
always
to
tell
her
of
my
intention
beforehand
this
pledge
however
for
her
own
sake
i
declined
to
give
knowing
how
wretched
she
would
be
during
all
the
time
of
my
absence
and
on
that
account
i
promised
instead
that
i
would
always
give
her
a
full
account
of
my
adventure
upon
returning
now
my
mother
as
might
be
expected
began
at
once
to
cast
about
for
some
means
of
relieving
me
from
all
further
peril
and
herself
from
great
anxiety
she
was
full
of
plans
for
fetching
lorna
in
some
wonderful
manner
out
of
the
power
of
the
doones
entirely
and
into
her
own
hands
where
she
was
to
remain
for
at
least
a
twelvemonth
learning
all
mother
and
annie
could
teach
her
of
dairy
business
and
farmhouse
life
and
the
best
mode
of
packing
butter
and
all
this
arose
from
my
happening
to
say
without
meaning
anything
how
the
poor
dear
had
longed
for
quiet
and
a
life
of
simplicity
and
a
rest
away
from
violence
bless
thee
mothernow
long
in
heaven
there
is
no
need
to
bless
thee
but
it
often
makes
a
dimness
now
in
my
wellworn
eyes
when
i
think
of
thy
lovingkindness
warmth
and
romantic
innocence
as
to
stealing
my
beloved
from
that
vile
glen
doone
the
deed
itself
was
not
impossible
nor
beyond
my
daring
but
in
the
first
place
would
she
come
leaving
her
old
grandfather
to
die
without
her
tendence
and
even
if
through
fear
of
carver
and
that
wicked
counsellor
she
should
consent
to
fly
would
it
be
possible
to
keep
her
without
a
regiment
of
soldiers
would
not
the
doones
at
once
ride
forth
to
scour
the
country
for
their
queen
and
finding
her
as
they
must
do
burn
our
house
and
murder
us
and
carry
her
back
triumphantly
all
this
i
laid
before
my
mother
and
to
such
effect
that
she
acknowledged
with
a
sigh
that
nothing
else
remained
for
me
in
the
present
state
of
matters
except
to
keep
a
careful
watch
upon
lorna
from
safe
distance
observe
the
policy
of
the
doones
and
wait
for
a
tide
in
their
affairs
meanwhile
i
might
even
fall
in
love
as
mother
unwisely
hinted
with
a
certain
more
peaceful
heiress
although
of
inferior
blood
who
would
be
daily
at
my
elbow
i
am
not
sure
but
what
dear
mother
herself
would
have
been
disappointed
had
i
proved
myself
so
fickle
and
my
disdain
and
indignation
at
the
mere
suggestion
did
not
so
much
displease
her
for
she
only
smiled
and
answered
well
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
god
knows
what
is
good
for
us
likings
will
not
come
to
order
otherwise
i
should
not
be
where
i
am
this
day
and
of
one
thing
i
am
rather
glad
uncle
reuben
well
deserves
that
his
pet
scheme
should
miscarry
he
who
called
my
boy
a
coward
an
ignoble
coward
because
he
would
not
join
some
crackbrained
plan
against
the
valley
which
sheltered
his
beloved
one
and
all
the
time
this
dreadful
coward
risking
his
life
daily
there
without
a
word
to
any
one
how
glad
i
am
that
you
will
not
have
for
all
her
miserable
money
that
little
dwarfish
granddaughter
of
the
insolent
old
miser
she
turned
and
by
her
side
was
standing
poor
ruth
huckaback
herself
white
and
sad
and
looking
steadily
at
my
mothers
face
which
became
as
red
as
a
plum
while
her
breath
deserted
her
if
you
please
madam
said
the
little
maiden
with
her
large
calm
eyes
unwavering
it
is
not
my
fault
but
god
almightys
that
i
am
a
little
dwarfish
creature
i
knew
not
that
you
regarded
me
with
so
much
contempt
on
that
account
neither
have
you
told
my
grandfather
at
least
within
my
hearing
that
he
was
an
insolent
old
miser
when
i
return
to
dulverton
which
i
trust
to
do
tomorrow
for
it
is
too
late
today
i
shall
be
careful
not
to
tell
him
your
opinion
of
him
lest
i
should
thwart
any
schemes
you
may
have
upon
his
property
i
thank
you
all
for
your
kindness
to
me
which
has
been
very
great
far
more
than
a
little
dwarfish
creature
could
for
her
own
sake
expect
i
will
only
add
for
your
further
guidance
one
more
little
truth
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
my
grandfather
will
settle
any
of
his
miserable
money
upon
me
if
i
offend
him
as
i
would
in
a
moment
for
the
sake
of
a
brave
and
straightforward
manhere
she
gave
me
a
glance
which
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
withmy
grandfather
upright
as
he
is
would
leave
me
without
a
shilling
and
i
often
wish
it
were
so
so
many
miseries
come
upon
me
from
the
miserable
money
here
she
broke
down
and
burst
out
crying
and
ran
away
with
a
faint
goodbye
while
we
three
looked
at
one
another
and
felt
that
we
had
the
worst
of
it
impudent
little
dwarf
said
my
mother
recovering
her
breath
after
ever
so
long
oh
john
how
thankful
you
ought
to
be
what
a
life
she
would
have
led
you
well
i
am
sure
said
annie
throwing
her
arms
around
poor
mother
who
could
have
thought
that
little
atomy
had
such
an
outrageous
spirit
for
my
part
i
cannot
think
how
she
can
have
been
sly
enough
to
hide
it
in
that
crafty
manner
that
john
might
think
her
an
angel
well
for
my
part
i
answered
laughing
i
never
admired
ruth
huckaback
half
or
a
quarter
so
much
before
she
is
rare
stuff
i
would
have
been
glad
to
have
married
her
tomorrow
if
i
had
never
seen
my
lorna
and
a
nice
nobody
i
should
have
been
in
my
own
house
cried
mother
i
never
can
be
thankful
enough
to
darling
lorna
for
saving
me
did
you
see
how
her
eyes
flashed
that
i
did
and
very
fine
they
were
now
nine
maidens
out
of
ten
would
have
feigned
not
to
have
heard
one
word
that
was
said
and
have
borne
black
malice
in
their
hearts
come
annie
now
would
not
you
have
done
so
i
think
said
annie
although
of
course
i
cannot
tell
you
know
john
that
i
should
have
been
ashamed
at
hearing
what
was
never
meant
for
me
and
should
have
been
almost
as
angry
with
myself
as
anybody
so
you
would
replied
my
mother
so
any
daughter
of
mine
would
have
done
instead
of
railing
and
reviling
however
i
am
very
sorry
that
any
words
of
mine
which
the
poor
little
thing
chose
to
overhear
should
have
made
her
so
forget
herself
i
shall
beg
her
pardon
before
she
goes
and
i
shall
expect
her
to
beg
mine
that
she
will
never
do
said
i
a
more
resolute
little
maiden
never
yet
had
right
upon
her
side
although
it
was
a
mere
accident
i
might
have
said
the
same
thing
myself
and
she
was
hard
upon
you
mother
dear
after
this
we
said
no
more
at
least
about
that
matter
and
little
ruth
the
next
morning
left
us
in
spite
of
all
that
we
could
do
she
vowed
an
everlasting
friendship
to
my
younger
sister
eliza
but
she
looked
at
annie
with
some
resentment
when
they
said
goodbye
for
being
so
much
taller
at
any
rate
so
annie
fancied
but
she
may
have
been
quite
wrong
i
rode
beside
the
little
maid
till
far
beyond
exeford
when
all
danger
of
the
moor
was
past
and
then
i
left
her
with
john
fry
not
wishing
to
be
too
particular
after
all
the
talk
about
her
money
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes
when
she
bade
me
farewell
and
she
sent
a
kind
message
home
to
mother
and
promised
to
come
again
at
christmas
if
she
could
win
permission
upon
the
whole
my
opinion
was
that
she
had
behaved
uncommonly
well
for
a
maid
whose
selflove
was
outraged
with
spirit
i
mean
and
proper
pride
and
yet
with
a
great
endeavour
to
forgive
which
is
meseems
the
hardest
of
all
things
to
a
woman
outside
of
her
own
family
after
this
for
another
month
nothing
worthy
of
notice
happened
except
of
course
that
i
found
it
needful
according
to
the
strictest
good
sense
and
honour
to
visit
lorna
immediately
after
my
discourse
with
mother
and
to
tell
her
all
about
it
my
beauty
gave
me
one
sweet
kiss
with
all
her
heart
as
she
always
did
when
she
kissed
at
all
and
i
begged
for
one
more
to
take
to
our
mother
and
before
leaving
i
obtained
it
it
is
not
for
me
to
tell
all
she
said
even
supposing
what
is
not
likely
that
any
one
cared
to
know
it
being
more
and
more
peculiar
to
ourselves
and
no
one
else
but
one
thing
that
she
said
was
this
and
i
took
good
care
to
carry
it
word
for
word
to
my
mother
and
annie
i
never
can
believe
dear
john
that
after
all
the
crime
and
outrage
wrought
by
my
reckless
family
it
ever
can
be
meant
for
me
to
settle
down
to
peace
and
comfort
in
a
simple
household
with
all
my
heart
i
long
for
home
any
home
however
dull
and
wearisome
to
those
used
to
it
would
seem
a
paradise
to
me
if
only
free
from
brawl
and
tumult
and
such
as
i
could
call
my
own
but
even
if
god
would
allow
me
this
in
lieu
of
my
wild
inheritance
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
doones
never
can
and
never
will
again
when
i
told
her
how
my
mother
and
annie
as
well
as
myself
longed
to
have
her
at
plovers
barrows
and
teach
her
all
the
quiet
duties
in
which
she
was
sure
to
take
such
delight
she
only
answered
with
a
bright
blush
that
while
her
grandfather
was
living
she
would
never
leave
him
and
that
even
if
she
were
free
certain
ruin
was
all
she
should
bring
to
any
house
that
received
her
at
least
within
the
utmost
reach
of
her
amiable
family
this
was
too
plain
to
be
denied
and
seeing
my
dejection
at
it
she
told
me
bravely
that
we
must
hope
for
better
times
if
possible
and
asked
how
long
i
would
wait
for
her
not
a
day
if
i
had
my
will
i
answered
very
warmly
at
which
she
turned
away
confused
and
would
not
look
at
me
for
awhile
but
all
my
life
i
went
on
to
say
if
my
fortune
is
so
ill
and
how
long
would
you
wait
for
me
lorna
till
i
could
get
you
she
answered
slyly
with
a
smile
which
was
brighter
to
me
than
the
brightest
wit
could
be
and
now
she
continued
you
bound
me
john
with
a
very
beautiful
ring
to
you
and
when
i
dare
not
wear
it
i
carry
it
always
on
my
heart
but
i
will
bind
you
to
me
you
dearest
with
the
very
poorest
and
plainest
thing
that
ever
you
set
eyes
on
i
could
give
you
fifty
fairer
ones
but
they
would
not
be
honest
and
i
love
you
for
your
honesty
and
nothing
else
of
course
john
so
dont
you
be
conceited
look
at
it
what
a
queer
old
thing
there
are
some
ancient
marks
upon
it
very
grotesque
and
wonderful
it
looks
like
a
cat
in
a
tree
almost
but
never
mind
what
it
looks
like
this
old
ring
must
have
been
a
giants
therefore
it
will
fit
you
perhaps
you
enormous
john
it
has
been
on
the
front
of
my
old
glass
necklace
which
my
grandfather
found
them
taking
away
and
very
soon
made
them
give
back
again
ever
since
i
can
remember
and
long
before
that
as
some
woman
told
me
now
you
seem
very
greatly
amazed
pray
what
thinks
my
lord
of
it
that
is
worth
fifty
of
the
pearl
thing
which
i
gave
you
you
darling
and
that
i
will
not
take
it
from
you
then
you
will
never
take
me
that
is
all
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
gentleman
no
gentleman
deara
yeoman
very
well
a
yeomannothing
to
do
with
a
yeoman
who
will
not
accept
my
lovegage
so
if
you
please
give
it
back
again
and
take
your
lovely
ring
back
she
looked
at
me
in
such
a
manner
half
in
earnest
half
in
jest
and
three
times
three
in
love
that
in
spite
of
all
good
resolutions
and
her
own
faint
protest
i
was
forced
to
abandon
all
firm
ideas
and
kiss
her
till
she
was
quite
ashamed
and
her
head
hung
on
my
bosom
with
the
night
of
her
hair
shed
over
me
then
i
placed
the
pearl
ring
back
on
the
soft
elastic
bend
of
the
finger
she
held
up
to
scold
me
and
on
my
own
smallest
finger
drew
the
heavy
hoop
she
had
given
me
i
considered
this
with
satisfaction
until
my
darling
recovered
herself
and
then
i
began
very
gravely
about
it
to
keep
her
if
i
could
from
chiding
me
mistress
lorna
this
is
not
the
ring
of
any
giant
it
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
very
ancient
thumbring
such
as
once
in
my
fathers
time
was
ploughed
up
out
of
the
ground
in
our
farm
and
sent
to
learned
doctors
who
told
us
all
about
it
but
kept
the
ring
for
their
trouble
i
will
accept
it
my
own
one
love
and
it
shall
go
to
my
grave
with
me
and
so
it
shall
unless
there
be
villains
who
would
dare
to
rob
the
dead
now
i
have
spoken
about
this
ring
though
i
scarcely
meant
to
do
so
and
would
rather
keep
to
myself
things
so
very
holy
because
it
holds
an
important
part
in
the
history
of
my
lorna
i
asked
her
where
the
glass
necklace
was
from
which
the
ring
was
fastened
and
which
she
had
worn
in
her
childhood
and
she
answered
that
she
hardly
knew
but
remembered
that
her
grandfather
had
begged
her
to
give
it
up
to
him
when
she
was
ten
years
old
or
so
and
had
promised
to
keep
it
for
her
until
she
could
take
care
of
it
at
the
same
time
giving
her
back
the
ring
and
fastening
it
from
her
pretty
neck
and
telling
her
to
be
proud
of
it
and
so
she
always
had
been
and
now
from
her
sweet
breast
she
took
it
and
it
became
john
ridds
delight
all
this
or
at
least
great
part
of
it
i
told
my
mother
truly
according
to
my
promise
and
she
was
greatly
pleased
with
lorna
for
having
been
so
good
to
me
and
for
speaking
so
very
sensibly
and
then
she
looked
at
the
great
gold
ring
but
could
by
no
means
interpret
it
only
she
was
quite
certain
as
indeed
i
myself
was
that
it
must
have
belonged
to
an
ancient
race
of
great
consideration
and
high
rank
in
their
time
upon
which
i
was
for
taking
it
off
lest
it
should
be
degraded
by
a
common
farmers
finger
but
mother
said
no
with
tears
in
her
eyes
if
the
common
farmer
had
won
the
great
lady
of
the
ancient
race
what
were
rings
and
oldworld
trinkets
when
compared
to
the
living
jewel
being
quite
of
her
opinion
in
this
and
loving
the
ring
which
had
no
gem
in
it
as
the
token
of
my
priceless
gem
i
resolved
to
wear
it
at
any
cost
except
when
i
should
be
ploughing
or
doing
things
likely
to
break
it
although
i
must
own
that
it
felt
very
queer
for
i
never
had
throttled
a
finger
before
and
it
looked
very
queer
for
a
length
of
time
upon
my
great
hardworking
hand
and
before
i
got
used
to
my
ring
or
people
could
think
that
it
belonged
to
me
plain
and
ungarnished
though
it
was
and
before
i
went
to
see
lorna
again
having
failed
to
find
any
necessity
and
remembering
my
duty
to
mother
we
all
had
something
else
to
think
of
not
so
pleasant
and
more
puzzling

john
returns
to
business
now
november
was
upon
us
and
we
had
kept
allhallowmass
with
roasting
of
skewered
apples
like
so
many
shuttlecocks
and
after
that
the
day
of
fawkes
as
became
good
protestants
with
merry
bonfires
and
burned
batatas
and
plenty
of
good
feeding
in
honour
of
our
religion
and
then
while
we
were
at
wheatsowing
another
visitor
arrived
this
was
master
jeremy
stickles
who
had
been
a
good
friend
to
me
as
described
before
in
london
and
had
earned
my
mothers
gratitude
so
far
as
ever
he
chose
to
have
it
and
he
seemed
inclined
to
have
it
all
for
he
made
our
farmhouse
his
headquarters
and
kept
us
quite
at
his
beck
and
call
going
out
at
any
time
of
the
evening
and
coming
back
at
any
time
of
the
morning
and
always
expecting
us
to
be
ready
whether
with
horse
or
man
or
maiden
or
fire
or
provisions
we
knew
that
he
was
employed
somehow
upon
the
service
of
the
king
and
had
at
different
stations
certain
troopers
and
orderlies
quite
at
his
disposal
also
we
knew
that
he
never
went
out
nor
even
slept
in
his
bedroom
without
heavy
firearms
well
loaded
and
a
sharp
sword
nigh
his
hand
and
that
he
held
a
great
commission
under
royal
signet
requiring
all
good
subjects
all
officers
of
whatever
degree
and
especially
justices
of
the
peace
to
aid
him
to
the
utmost
with
person
beast
and
chattel
or
to
answer
it
at
their
peril
now
master
jeremy
stickles
of
course
knowing
well
what
women
are
durst
not
open
to
any
of
them
the
nature
of
his
instructions
but
after
awhile
perceiving
that
i
could
be
relied
upon
and
that
it
was
a
great
discomfort
not
to
have
me
with
him
he
took
me
aside
in
a
lonely
place
and
told
me
nearly
everything
having
bound
me
first
by
oath
not
to
impart
to
any
one
without
his
own
permission
until
all
was
over
but
at
this
present
time
of
writing
all
is
over
long
ago
ay
and
forgotten
too
i
ween
except
by
those
who
suffered
therefore
may
i
tell
the
whole
without
any
breach
of
confidence
master
stickles
was
going
forth
upon
his
usual
night
journey
when
he
met
me
coming
home
and
i
said
something
half
in
jest
about
his
zeal
and
secrecy
upon
which
he
looked
all
round
the
yard
and
led
me
to
an
open
space
in
the
clover
field
adjoining
john
he
said
you
have
some
right
to
know
the
meaning
of
all
this
being
trusted
as
you
were
by
the
lord
chief
justice
but
he
found
you
scarcely
supple
enough
neither
gifted
with
due
brains
thank
god
for
that
same
i
answered
while
he
tapped
his
head
to
signify
his
own
much
larger
allowance
then
he
made
me
bind
myself
which
in
an
evil
hour
i
did
to
retain
his
secret
and
after
that
he
went
on
solemnly
and
with
much
importance
there
be
some
people
fit
to
plot
and
others
to
be
plotted
against
and
others
to
unravel
plots
which
is
the
highest
gift
of
all
this
last
hath
fallen
to
my
share
and
a
very
thankless
gift
it
is
although
a
rare
and
choice
one
much
of
peril
too
attends
it
daring
courage
and
great
coolness
are
as
needful
for
the
work
as
ready
wit
and
spotless
honour
therefore
his
majestys
advisers
have
chosen
me
for
this
high
task
and
they
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
man
although
you
have
been
in
london
jack
much
longer
than
you
wished
it
you
are
wholly
ignorant
of
course
in
matters
of
state
and
the
public
weal
well
said
i
no
doubt
but
i
am
and
all
the
better
for
me
although
i
heard
a
deal
of
them
for
everybody
was
talking
and
ready
to
come
to
blows
if
only
it
could
be
done
without
danger
but
one
said
this
and
one
said
that
and
they
talked
so
much
about
birminghams
and
tantivies
and
whigs
and
tories
and
protestant
flails
and
such
like
that
i
was
only
too
glad
to
have
my
glass
and
clink
my
spoon
for
answer
right
john
thou
art
right
as
usual
let
the
king
go
his
own
gait
he
hath
too
many
mistresses
to
be
ever
englands
master
nobody
need
fear
him
for
he
is
not
like
his
father
he
will
have
his
own
way
tis
true
but
without
stopping
other
folk
of
theirs
and
well
he
knows
what
women
are
for
he
never
asks
them
questions
now
heard
you
much
in
london
town
about
the
duke
of
monmouth
not
so
very
much
i
answered
not
half
so
much
as
in
devonshire
only
that
he
was
a
hearty
man
and
a
very
handsome
one
and
now
was
banished
by
the
tories
and
most
people
wished
he
was
coming
back
instead
of
the
duke
of
york
who
was
trying
boots
in
scotland
things
are
changed
since
you
were
in
town
the
whigs
are
getting
up
again
through
the
folly
of
the
tories
killing
poor
lord
russell
and
now
this
master
sidney
if
my
lord
condemns
him
will
make
it
worse
again
there
is
much
disaffection
everywhere
and
it
must
grow
to
an
outbreak
the
king
hath
many
troops
in
london
and
meaneth
to
bring
more
from
tangier
but
he
cannot
command
these
country
places
and
the
trained
bands
cannot
help
him
much
even
if
they
would
now
do
you
understand
me
john
in
truth
not
i
i
see
not
what
tangier
hath
to
do
with
exmoor
nor
the
duke
of
monmouth
with
jeremy
stickles
thou
great
clod
put
it
the
other
way
jeremy
stickles
may
have
much
to
do
about
the
duke
of
monmouth
the
whigs
having
failed
of
exclusion
and
having
been
punished
bitterly
for
the
blood
they
shed
are
ripe
for
any
violence
and
the
turn
of
the
balance
is
now
to
them
seesaw
is
the
fashion
of
england
always
and
the
whigs
will
soon
be
the
topsawyers
but
said
i
still
more
confused
the
king
is
the
topsawyer
according
to
our
proverb
how
then
can
the
whigs
be
thou
art
a
hopeless
ass
john
better
to
sew
with
a
chestnut
than
to
teach
thee
the
constitution
let
it
be
so
let
it
be
i
have
seen
a
boy
of
five
years
old
more
apt
at
politics
than
thou
nay
look
not
offended
lad
it
is
my
fault
for
being
overdeep
to
thee
i
should
have
considered
thy
intellect
nay
master
jeremy
make
no
apologies
it
is
i
that
should
excuse
myself
but
god
knows
i
have
no
politics
stick
to
that
my
lad
he
answered
so
shalt
thou
die
easier
now
in
ten
words
without
parties
or
trying
thy
poor
brain
too
much
i
am
here
to
watch
the
gathering
of
a
secret
plot
not
so
much
against
the
king
as
against
the
due
succession
now
i
understand
at
last
but
master
stickles
you
might
have
said
all
that
an
hour
ago
almost
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
to
thee
he
replied
with
much
compassion
thy
hat
is
nearly
off
thy
head
with
the
swelling
of
brain
i
have
given
thee
blows
blows
are
thy
business
jack
there
thou
art
in
thine
element
and
haply
this
business
will
bring
thee
plenty
even
for
thy
great
head
to
take
now
hearken
to
one
who
wishes
thee
well
and
plainly
sees
the
end
of
itstick
thou
to
the
winning
side
and
have
naught
to
do
with
the
other
one
that
said
i
in
great
haste
and
hurry
is
the
very
thing
i
want
to
do
if
i
only
knew
which
was
the
winning
side
for
the
sake
of
lornathat
is
to
say
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
mother
and
sisters
and
the
farm
ha
cried
jeremy
stickles
laughing
at
the
redness
of
my
facelorna
saidst
thou
now
what
lorna
is
it
the
name
of
a
maiden
or
a
lightolove
keep
to
your
own
business
i
answered
very
proudly
spy
as
much
as
eer
thou
wilt
and
use
our
house
for
doing
it
without
asking
leave
or
telling
but
if
i
ever
find
thee
spying
into
my
affairs
all
the
kings
lifeguards
in
london
and
the
dragoons
thou
bringest
hither
shall
not
save
thee
from
my
handor
one
finger
is
enough
for
thee
being
carried
beyond
myself
by
his
insolence
about
lorna
i
looked
at
master
stickles
so
and
spake
in
such
a
voice
that
all
his
daring
courage
and
his
spotless
honour
quailed
within
him
and
he
shrankas
if
i
would
strike
so
small
a
man
then
i
left
him
and
went
to
work
at
the
sacks
upon
the
cornfloor
to
take
my
evil
spirit
from
me
before
i
should
see
mother
for
to
tell
the
truth
now
my
strength
was
full
and
troubles
were
gathering
round
me
and
people
took
advantage
so
much
of
my
easy
temper
sometimes
when
i
was
overtried
a
sudden
heat
ran
over
me
and
a
glowing
of
all
my
muscles
and
a
tingling
for
a
mighty
throw
such
as
my
utmost
selfcommand
and
fear
of
hurting
any
one
could
but
ill
refrain
afterwards
i
was
always
very
sadly
ashamed
of
myself
knowing
how
poor
a
thing
bodily
strength
is
as
compared
with
power
of
mind
and
that
it
is
a
cowards
part
to
misuse
it
upon
weaker
folk
for
the
present
there
was
a
little
breach
between
master
stickles
and
me
for
which
i
blamed
myself
very
sorely
but
though
in
full
memory
of
his
kindness
and
faithfulness
in
london
i
asked
his
pardon
many
times
for
my
foolish
anger
with
him
and
offered
to
undergo
any
penalty
he
would
lay
upon
me
he
only
said
it
was
no
matter
there
was
nothing
to
forgive
when
people
say
that
the
truth
often
is
that
they
can
forgive
nothing
so
for
the
present
a
breach
was
made
between
master
jeremy
and
myself
which
to
me
seemed
no
great
loss
inasmuch
as
it
relieved
me
from
any
privity
to
his
dealings
for
which
i
had
small
liking
all
i
feared
was
lest
i
might
in
any
way
be
ungrateful
to
him
but
when
he
would
have
no
more
of
me
what
could
i
do
to
help
it
however
in
a
few
days
time
i
was
of
good
service
to
him
as
you
shall
see
in
its
proper
place
but
now
my
own
affairs
were
thrown
into
such
disorder
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
hiding
my
uneasiness
for
suddenly
without
any
warning
or
a
word
of
message
all
my
lornas
signals
ceased
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
watch
for
daily
and
as
it
were
to
feed
upon
them
with
a
glowing
heart
the
first
time
i
stood
on
the
wooded
crest
and
found
no
change
from
yesterday
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
or
thought
at
least
that
it
must
be
some
great
mistake
on
the
part
of
my
love
however
even
that
oppressed
me
with
a
heavy
heart
which
grew
heavier
as
i
found
from
day
to
day
no
token
three
times
i
went
and
waited
long
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
where
now
the
stream
was
brown
and
angry
with
the
rains
of
autumn
and
the
weeping
trees
hung
leafless
but
though
i
waited
at
every
hour
of
day
and
far
into
the
night
no
light
footstep
came
to
meet
me
no
sweet
voice
was
in
the
air
all
was
lonely
drear
and
drenched
with
sodden
desolation
it
seemed
as
if
my
love
was
dead
and
the
winds
were
at
her
funeral
once
i
sought
far
up
the
valley
where
i
had
never
been
before
even
beyond
the
copse
where
lorna
had
found
and
lost
her
brave
young
cousin
following
up
the
river
channel
in
shelter
of
the
evening
fog
i
gained
a
corner
within
stones
throw
of
the
last
outlying
cot
this
was
a
gloomy
low
square
house
without
any
light
in
the
windows
roughly
built
of
wood
and
stone
as
i
saw
when
i
drew
nearer
for
knowing
it
to
be
carvers
dwelling
or
at
least
suspecting
so
from
some
words
of
lornas
i
was
led
by
curiosity
and
perhaps
by
jealousy
to
have
a
closer
look
at
it
therefore
i
crept
up
the
stream
losing
half
my
sense
of
fear
by
reason
of
anxiety
and
in
truth
there
was
not
much
to
fear
the
sky
being
now
too
dark
for
even
a
shooter
of
wild
fowl
to
make
good
aim
and
nothing
else
but
guns
could
hurt
me
as
in
the
pride
of
my
strength
i
thought
and
in
my
skill
of
singlestick
nevertheless
i
went
warily
being
now
almost
among
this
nest
of
cockatrices
the
back
of
carvers
house
abutted
on
the
waves
of
the
rushing
stream
and
seeing
a
loophole
vacant
for
muskets
i
looked
in
but
all
was
quiet
so
far
as
i
could
judge
by
listening
there
was
no
one
now
inside
and
my
heart
for
a
moment
leaped
with
joy
for
i
had
feared
to
find
lorna
there
then
i
took
a
careful
survey
of
the
dwelling
and
its
windows
and
its
door
and
aspect
as
if
i
had
been
a
robber
meaning
to
make
privy
entrance
it
was
well
for
me
that
i
did
this
as
you
will
find
hereafter
having
impressed
upon
my
mind
a
slow
but
perhaps
retentive
mind
all
the
bearings
of
the
place
and
all
its
opportunities
and
even
the
curve
of
the
stream
along
it
and
the
bushes
near
the
door
i
was
much
inclined
to
go
farther
up
and
understand
all
the
village
but
a
bar
of
red
light
across
the
river
some
forty
yards
on
above
me
and
crossing
from
the
opposite
side
like
a
chain
prevented
me
in
that
second
house
there
was
a
gathering
of
loud
and
merry
outlaws
making
as
much
noise
as
if
they
had
the
law
upon
their
side
some
indeed
as
i
approached
were
laying
down
both
right
and
wrong
as
purely
and
with
as
high
a
sense
as
if
they
knew
the
difference
cold
and
troubled
as
i
was
i
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
before
i
betook
myself
home
that
night
and
eased
dear
mothers
heart
so
much
and
made
her
pale
face
spread
with
smiles
i
had
resolved
to
penetrate
glen
doone
from
the
upper
end
and
learn
all
about
my
lorna
not
but
what
i
might
have
entered
from
my
unsuspected
channel
as
so
often
i
had
done
but
that
i
saw
fearful
need
for
knowing
something
more
than
that
here
was
every
sort
of
trouble
gathering
upon
me
here
was
jeremy
stickles
stealing
upon
every
one
in
the
dark
here
was
uncle
reuben
plotting
satan
only
could
tell
what
here
was
a
white
nightcapped
man
coming
bodily
from
the
grave
here
was
my
own
sister
annie
committed
to
a
highwayman
and
mother
in
distraction
most
of
allhere
there
and
wherewas
my
lorna
stolen
dungeoned
perhaps
outraged
it
was
no
time
for
shilly
shally
for
the
balance
of
this
and
that
or
for
a
man
with
blood
and
muscle
to
pat
his
nose
and
ponder
if
i
left
my
lorna
so
if
i
let
those
blacksould
villains
work
their
pleasure
on
my
love
if
the
heart
that
clave
to
mine
could
find
no
vigour
in
itthen
let
maidens
cease
from
men
and
rest
their
faith
in
tabbycats
rudely
rolling
these
ideas
in
my
heavy
head
and
brain
i
resolved
to
let
the
morrow
put
them
into
form
and
order
but
not
contradict
them
and
then
as
my
constitution
willed
being
like
that
of
england
i
slept
and
there
was
no
stopping
me
chapter
xxxvii
a
very
desperate
venture
that
the
enterprise
now
resolved
upon
was
far
more
dangerous
than
any
hitherto
attempted
by
me
needs
no
further
proof
than
thisi
went
and
made
my
will
at
porlock
with
a
middling
honest
lawyer
there
not
that
i
had
much
to
leave
but
that
none
could
say
how
far
the
farm
and
all
the
farming
stock
might
depend
on
my
disposition
it
makes
me
smile
when
i
remember
how
particular
i
was
and
how
for
the
life
of
me
i
was
puzzled
to
bequeath
most
part
of
my
clothes
and
hats
and
things
altogether
my
own
to
lorna
without
the
shrewd
old
lawyer
knowing
who
she
was
and
where
she
lived
at
last
indeed
i
flattered
myself
that
i
had
baffled
old
tapes
curiosity
but
his
wrinkled
smile
and
his
speech
at
parting
made
me
again
uneasy
a
very
excellent
will
young
sir
an
admirably
just
and
virtuous
will
all
your
effects
to
your
nearest
of
kin
filial
and
fraternal
duty
thoroughly
exemplified
nothing
diverted
to
alien
channels
except
a
small
token
of
esteem
and
reverence
to
an
elderly
lady
i
presume
and
which
may
or
may
not
be
valid
or
invalid
on
the
ground
of
uncertainty
or
the
absence
of
any
legal
status
on
the
part
of
the
legatee
ha
ha
yes
yes
few
young
men
are
so
free
from
exceptionable
entanglements
two
guineas
is
my
charge
sir
and
a
rare
good
will
for
the
money
very
prudent
of
you
sir
does
you
credit
in
every
way
well
well
we
all
must
die
and
often
the
young
before
the
old
not
only
did
i
think
two
guineas
a
great
deal
too
much
money
for
a
quarter
of
an
hours
employment
but
also
i
disliked
particularly
the
words
with
which
he
concluded
they
sounded
from
his
grating
voice
like
the
evil
omen
of
a
croaking
raven
nevertheless
i
still
abode
in
my
fixed
resolve
to
go
and
find
out
if
i
died
for
it
what
was
become
of
lorna
and
herein
i
lay
no
claim
to
courage
the
matter
being
simply
a
choice
between
two
evils
of
which
by
far
the
greater
one
was
of
course
to
lose
my
darling
the
journey
was
a
great
deal
longer
to
fetch
around
the
southern
hills
and
enter
by
the
doonegate
than
to
cross
the
lower
land
and
steal
in
by
the
waterslide
however
i
durst
not
take
a
horse
for
fear
of
the
doones
who
might
be
abroad
upon
their
usual
business
but
started
betimes
in
the
evening
so
as
not
to
hurry
or
waste
any
strength
upon
the
way
and
thus
i
came
to
the
robbers
highway
walking
circumspectly
scanning
the
skyline
of
every
hill
and
searching
the
folds
of
every
valley
for
any
moving
figure
although
it
was
now
well
on
towards
dark
and
the
sun
was
down
an
hour
or
so
i
could
see
the
robbers
road
before
me
in
a
trough
of
the
winding
hills
where
the
brook
ploughed
down
from
the
higher
barrows
and
the
coving
banks
were
roofed
with
furze
at
present
there
was
no
one
passing
neither
post
nor
sentinel
so
far
as
i
could
descry
but
i
thought
it
safer
to
wait
a
little
as
twilight
melted
into
night
and
then
i
crept
down
a
seam
of
the
highland
and
stood
upon
the
doonetrack
as
the
road
approached
the
entrance
it
became
more
straight
and
strong
like
a
channel
cut
from
rock
with
the
water
brawling
darkly
along
the
naked
side
of
it
not
a
tree
or
bush
was
left
to
shelter
a
man
from
bullets
all
was
stern
and
stiff
and
rugged
as
i
could
not
help
perceiving
even
through
the
darkness
and
a
smell
as
of
churchyard
mould
a
sense
of
being
boxed
in
and
cooped
made
me
long
to
be
out
again
and
here
i
was
or
seemed
to
be
particularly
unlucky
for
as
i
drew
near
the
very
entrance
lightly
of
foot
and
warily
the
moon
which
had
often
been
my
friend
like
an
enemy
broke
upon
me
topping
the
eastward
ridge
of
rock
and
filling
all
the
open
spaces
with
the
play
of
wavering
light
i
shrank
back
into
the
shadowy
quarter
on
the
right
side
of
the
road
and
gloomily
employed
myself
to
watch
the
triple
entrance
on
which
the
moonlight
fell
askew
all
across
and
before
the
three
rude
and
beetling
archways
hung
a
felled
oak
overhead
black
and
thick
and
threatening
this
as
i
heard
before
could
be
let
fall
in
a
moment
so
as
to
crush
a
score
of
men
and
bar
the
approach
of
horses
behind
this
tree
the
rocky
mouth
was
spanned
as
by
a
gallery
with
brushwood
and
piled
timber
all
upon
a
ledge
of
stone
where
thirty
men
might
lurk
unseen
and
fire
at
any
invader
from
that
rampart
it
would
be
impossible
to
dislodge
them
because
the
rock
fell
sheer
below
them
twenty
feet
or
it
may
be
more
while
overhead
it
towered
three
hundred
and
so
jutted
over
that
nothing
could
be
cast
upon
them
even
if
a
man
could
climb
the
height
and
the
access
to
this
portcullis
placeif
i
may
so
call
it
being
no
portcullis
therewas
through
certain
rocky
chambers
known
to
the
tenants
only
but
the
cleverest
of
their
devices
and
the
most
puzzling
to
an
enemy
was
that
instead
of
one
mouth
only
there
were
three
to
choose
from
with
nothing
to
betoken
which
was
the
proper
access
all
being
pretty
much
alike
and
all
unfenced
and
yawning
and
the
common
rumour
was
that
in
times
of
any
danger
when
any
force
was
known
to
be
on
muster
in
their
neighbourhood
they
changed
their
entrance
every
day
and
diverted
the
other
two
by
means
of
sliding
doors
to
the
chasms
and
dark
abysses
now
i
could
see
those
three
rough
arches
jagged
black
and
terrible
and
i
knew
that
only
one
of
them
could
lead
me
to
the
valley
neither
gave
the
river
now
any
further
guidance
but
dived
underground
with
a
sullen
roar
where
it
met
the
crossbar
of
the
mountain
having
no
means
at
all
of
judging
which
was
the
right
way
of
the
three
and
knowing
that
the
other
two
would
lead
to
almost
certain
death
in
the
ruggedness
and
darknessfor
how
could
a
man
among
precipices
and
bottomless
depths
of
water
without
a
ray
of
light
have
any
chance
to
save
his
lifei
do
declare
that
i
was
half
inclined
to
go
away
and
have
done
with
it
however
i
knew
one
thing
for
certain
to
wit
that
the
longer
i
stayed
debating
the
more
would
the
enterprise
pall
upon
me
and
the
less
my
relish
be
and
it
struck
me
that
in
times
of
peace
the
middle
way
was
the
likeliest
and
the
others
diverging
right
and
left
in
their
farther
parts
might
be
made
to
slide
into
it
not
far
from
the
entrance
at
the
pleasure
of
the
warders
also
i
took
it
for
good
omen
that
i
remembered
as
rarely
happened
a
very
fine
line
in
the
latin
grammar
whose
emphasis
and
meaning
is
middle
road
is
safest
therefore
without
more
hesitation
i
plunged
into
the
middle
way
holding
a
long
ash
staff
before
me
shodden
at
the
end
with
iron
presently
i
was
in
black
darkness
groping
along
the
wall
and
feeling
a
deal
more
fear
than
i
wished
to
feel
especially
when
upon
looking
back
i
could
no
longer
see
the
light
which
i
had
forsaken
then
i
stumbled
over
something
hard
and
sharp
and
very
cold
moreover
so
grievous
to
my
legs
that
it
needed
my
very
best
doctrine
and
humour
to
forbear
from
swearing
in
the
manner
they
use
in
london
but
when
i
arose
and
felt
it
and
knew
it
to
be
a
culverin
i
was
somewhat
reassured
thereby
inasmuch
as
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
plant
this
engine
except
in
the
real
and
true
entrance
therefore
i
went
on
again
more
painfully
and
wearily
and
presently
found
it
to
be
good
that
i
had
received
that
knock
and
borne
it
with
such
patience
for
otherwise
i
might
have
blundered
full
upon
the
sentries
and
been
shot
without
more
ado
as
it
was
i
had
barely
time
to
draw
back
as
i
turned
a
corner
upon
them
and
if
their
lanthorn
had
been
in
its
place
they
could
scarce
have
failed
to
descry
me
unless
indeed
i
had
seen
the
gleam
before
i
turned
the
corner
there
seemed
to
be
only
two
of
them
of
size
indeed
and
stature
as
all
the
doones
must
be
but
i
need
not
have
feared
to
encounter
them
both
had
they
been
unarmed
as
i
was
it
was
plain
however
that
each
had
a
long
and
heavy
carbine
not
in
his
hands
as
it
should
have
been
but
standing
close
beside
him
therefore
it
behoved
me
now
to
be
exceedingly
careful
and
even
that
might
scarce
avail
without
luck
in
proportion
so
i
kept
well
back
at
the
corner
and
laid
one
cheek
to
the
rock
face
and
kept
my
outer
eye
round
the
jut
in
the
wariest
mode
i
could
compass
watching
my
opportunity
and
this
is
what
i
saw
the
two
villains
looked
very
happywhich
villains
have
no
right
to
be
but
often
are
meseemeththey
were
sitting
in
a
niche
of
rock
with
the
lanthorn
in
the
corner
quaffing
something
from
glass
measures
and
playing
at
pushpin
or
shepherds
chess
or
basset
or
some
trivial
game
of
that
sort
each
was
smoking
a
long
clay
pipe
quite
of
new
london
shape
i
could
see
for
the
shadow
was
thrown
out
clearly
and
each
would
laugh
from
time
to
time
as
he
fancied
he
got
the
better
of
it
one
was
sitting
with
his
knees
up
and
left
hand
on
his
thigh
and
this
one
had
his
back
to
me
and
seemed
to
be
the
stouter
the
other
leaned
more
against
the
rock
half
sitting
and
half
astraddle
and
wearing
leathern
overalls
as
if
newly
come
from
riding
i
could
see
his
face
quite
clearly
by
the
light
of
the
open
lanthorn
and
a
handsomer
or
a
bolder
face
i
had
seldom
if
ever
set
eyes
upon
insomuch
that
it
made
me
very
unhappy
to
think
of
his
being
so
near
my
lorna
how
long
am
i
to
stand
crouching
here
i
asked
of
myself
at
last
being
tired
of
hearing
them
cry
score
one
score
two
no
by

charlie
by

i
say
it
is
phelps
and
yet
my
only
chance
of
slipping
by
them
unperceived
was
to
wait
till
they
quarrelled
more
and
came
to
blows
about
it
presently
as
i
made
up
my
mind
to
steal
along
towards
them
for
the
cavern
was
pretty
wide
just
there
charlie
or
charleworth
doone
the
younger
and
taller
man
reached
forth
his
hand
to
seize
the
money
which
he
swore
he
had
won
that
time
upon
this
the
other
jerked
his
arm
vowing
that
he
had
no
right
to
it
whereupon
charlie
flung
at
his
face
the
contents
of
the
glass
he
was
sipping
but
missed
him
and
hit
the
candle
which
sputtered
with
a
flare
of
blue
flame
from
the
strength
perhaps
of
the
spirit
and
then
went
out
completely
at
this
one
swore
and
the
other
laughed
and
before
they
had
settled
what
to
do
i
was
past
them
and
round
the
corner
and
then
like
a
giddy
fool
as
i
was
i
needs
must
give
them
a
startlerthe
whoop
of
an
owl
done
so
exactly
as
john
fry
had
taught
me
and
echoed
by
the
roof
so
fearfully
that
one
of
them
dropped
the
tinder
box
and
the
other
caught
up
his
gun
and
cocked
it
at
least
as
i
judged
by
the
sounds
they
made
and
then
too
late
i
knew
my
madness
for
if
either
of
them
had
fired
no
doubt
but
what
all
the
village
would
have
risen
and
rushed
upon
me
however
as
the
luck
of
the
matter
went
it
proved
for
my
advantage
for
i
heard
one
say
to
the
other
curse
it
charlie
what
was
that
it
scared
me
so
i
have
dropped
my
box
my
flint
is
gone
and
everything
will
the
brimstone
catch
from
your
pipe
my
lad
my
pipe
is
out
phelps
ever
so
long
damn
it
i
am
not
afraid
of
an
owl
man
give
me
the
lanthorn
and
stay
here
im
not
half
done
with
you
yet
my
friend
well
said
my
boy
well
said
go
straight
to
carvers
mind
you
the
other
sleepy
heads
be
snoring
as
there
is
nothing
up
tonight
no
dallying
now
under
captains
window
queen
will
have
nought
to
say
to
you
and
carver
will
punch
your
head
into
a
new
wick
for
your
lanthorn
will
he
though
two
can
play
at
that
and
so
after
some
rude
jests
and
laughter
and
a
few
more
oaths
i
heard
charlie
or
at
any
rate
somebody
coming
toward
me
with
a
loose
and
not
too
sober
footfall
as
he
reeled
a
little
in
his
gait
and
i
would
not
move
from
his
way
one
inch
after
his
talk
of
lorna
but
only
longed
to
grasp
him
if
common
sense
permitted
it
his
braided
coat
came
against
my
thumb
and
his
leathern
gaiters
brushed
my
knee
if
he
had
turned
or
noticed
it
he
would
have
been
a
dead
man
in
a
moment
but
his
drunkenness
saved
him
so
i
let
him
reel
on
unharmed
and
thereupon
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
have
no
better
guide
passing
as
he
would
exactly
where
i
wished
to
be
that
is
to
say
under
lornas
window
therefore
i
followed
him
without
any
especial
caution
and
soon
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
form
against
the
moonlit
sky
down
a
steep
and
winding
path
with
a
handrail
at
the
corners
such
as
they
have
at
ilfracombe
master
charlie
tripped
alongand
indeed
there
was
much
tripping
and
he
must
have
been
an
active
fellow
to
recover
as
he
didand
after
him
walked
i
much
hoping
for
his
own
poor
sake
that
he
might
not
turn
and
espy
me
but
bacchus
of
whom
i
read
at
school
with
great
wonder
about
his
meaningand
the
same
i
may
say
of
venus
that
great
deity
preserved
charlie
his
pious
worshipper
from
regarding
consequences
so
he
led
me
very
kindly
to
the
top
of
the
meadow
land
where
the
stream
from
underground
broke
forth
seething
quietly
with
a
little
hiss
of
bubbles
hence
i
had
fair
view
and
outline
of
the
robbers
township
spread
with
bushes
here
and
there
but
not
heavily
overshadowed
the
moon
approaching
now
the
full
brought
the
forms
in
manner
forth
clothing
each
with
character
as
the
moon
more
than
the
sun
does
to
an
eye
accustomed
i
knew
that
the
captains
house
was
first
both
from
what
lorna
had
said
of
it
and
from
my
mothers
description
and
now
again
from
seeing
charlie
halt
there
for
a
certain
time
and
whistle
on
his
fingers
and
hurry
on
fearing
consequence
the
tune
that
he
whistled
was
strange
to
me
and
lingered
in
my
ears
as
having
something
very
new
and
striking
and
fantastic
in
it
and
i
repeated
it
softly
to
myself
while
i
marked
the
position
of
the
houses
and
the
beauty
of
the
village
for
the
stream
in
lieu
of
any
street
passing
between
the
houses
and
affording
perpetual
change
and
twinkling
and
reflections
moreover
by
its
sleepy
murmur
soothing
all
the
dwellers
there
this
and
the
snugness
of
the
position
walled
with
rock
and
spread
with
herbage
made
it
look
in
the
quiet
moonlight
like
a
little
paradise
and
to
think
of
all
the
inmates
there
sleeping
with
good
consciences
having
plied
their
useful
trade
of
making
others
work
for
them
enjoying
life
without
much
labour
yet
with
great
renown
master
charlie
went
down
the
village
and
i
followed
him
carefully
keeping
as
much
as
possible
in
the
shadowy
places
and
watching
the
windows
of
every
house
lest
any
light
should
be
burning
as
i
passed
sir
ensors
house
my
heart
leaped
up
for
i
spied
a
window
higher
than
the
rest
above
the
ground
and
with
a
faint
light
moving
this
could
hardly
fail
to
be
the
room
wherein
my
darling
lay
for
here
that
impudent
young
fellow
had
gazed
while
he
was
whistling
and
here
my
courage
grew
tenfold
and
my
spirit
feared
no
evilfor
lo
if
lorna
had
been
surrendered
to
that
scoundrel
carver
she
would
not
have
been
at
her
grandfathers
house
but
in
carvers
accursed
dwelling
warm
with
this
idea
i
hurried
after
charleworth
doone
being
resolved
not
to
harm
him
now
unless
my
own
life
required
it
and
while
i
watched
from
behind
a
tree
the
door
of
the
farthest
house
was
opened
and
sure
enough
it
was
carvers
self
who
stood
bareheaded
and
half
undressed
in
the
doorway
i
could
see
his
great
black
chest
and
arms
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
he
bore
who
wants
me
this
time
of
night
he
grumbled
in
a
deep
gruff
voice
any
young
scamp
prowling
after
the
maids
shall
have
sore
bones
for
his
trouble
all
the
fair
maids
are
for
thee
are
they
master
carver
charlie
answered
laughing
we
young
scamps
must
be
wellcontent
with
coarser
stuff
than
thou
wouldst
have
would
have
ay
and
will
have
the
great
beast
muttered
angrily
i
bide
my
time
but
not
very
long
only
one
word
for
thy
good
charlie
i
will
fling
thee
senseless
into
the
river
if
ever
i
catch
thy
girlface
there
again
mayhap
master
carver
it
is
more
than
thou
couldst
do
but
i
will
not
keep
thee
thou
art
not
pleasant
company
tonight
all
i
want
is
a
light
for
my
lanthorn
and
a
glass
of
schnapps
if
thou
hast
it
what
is
become
of
thy
light
then
good
for
thee
i
am
not
on
duty
a
great
owl
flew
between
me
and
phelps
as
we
watched
beside
the
culvern
and
so
scared
was
he
at
our
fierce
bright
eyes
that
he
fell
and
knocked
the
light
out
likely
tale
or
likely
lie
charles
we
will
have
the
truth
tomorrow
here
take
thy
light
and
be
gone
with
thee
all
virtuous
men
are
in
bed
now
then
so
will
i
be
and
why
art
thou
not
ha
have
i
earned
my
schnapps
now
if
thou
hast
thou
hast
paid
a
bad
debt
there
is
too
much
in
thee
already
be
off
my
patience
is
done
with
then
he
slammed
the
door
in
the
young
mans
face
having
kindled
his
lanthorn
by
this
time
and
charlie
went
up
to
the
watchplace
again
muttering
as
he
passed
me
bad
lookout
for
all
of
us
when
that
surly
old
beast
is
captain
no
gentle
blood
in
him
no
hospitality
not
even
pleasant
language
nor
a
good
new
oath
in
his
frowsy
pate
ive
a
mind
to
cut
the
whole
of
it
and
but
for
the
girls
i
would
so
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
as
they
say
when
i
stood
in
the
shade
by
lornas
window
and
whispered
her
name
gently
the
house
was
of
one
story
only
as
the
others
were
with
pineends
standing
forth
the
stone
and
only
two
rough
windows
upon
that
western
side
of
it
and
perhaps
both
of
them
were
lornas
the
doones
had
been
their
own
builders
for
no
one
should
know
their
ins
and
outs
and
of
course
their
work
was
clumsy
as
for
their
windows
they
stole
them
mostly
from
the
houses
round
about
but
though
the
window
was
not
very
close
i
might
have
whispered
long
enough
before
she
would
have
answered
me
frightened
as
she
was
no
doubt
by
many
a
rude
overture
and
i
durst
not
speak
aloud
because
i
saw
another
watchman
posted
on
the
western
cliff
and
commanding
all
the
valley
and
now
this
man
having
no
companion
for
drinking
or
for
gambling
espied
me
against
the
wall
of
the
house
and
advanced
to
the
brink
and
challenged
me
who
are
you
there
answer
one
two
three
and
i
fire
at
thee
the
nozzle
of
his
gun
was
pointed
full
upon
me
as
i
could
see
with
the
moonlight
striking
on
the
barrel
he
was
not
more
than
fifty
yards
off
and
now
he
began
to
reckon
being
almost
desperate
about
it
i
began
to
whistle
wondering
how
far
i
should
get
before
i
lost
my
windpipe
and
as
luck
would
have
it
my
lips
fell
into
that
strange
tune
i
had
practised
last
the
one
i
had
heard
from
charlie
my
mouth
would
scarcely
frame
the
notes
being
parched
with
terror
but
to
my
surprise
the
man
fell
back
dropped
his
gun
and
saluted
oh
sweetest
of
all
sweet
melodies
that
tune
was
carver
doones
passport
as
i
heard
long
afterwards
which
charleworth
doone
had
imitated
for
decoy
of
lorna
the
sentinel
took
me
for
that
vile
carver
who
was
like
enough
to
be
prowling
there
for
private
talk
with
lorna
but
not
very
likely
to
shout
forth
his
name
if
it
might
be
avoided
the
watchman
perceiving
the
danger
perhaps
of
intruding
on
carvers
privacy
not
only
retired
along
the
cliff
but
withdrew
himself
to
good
distance
meanwhile
he
had
done
me
the
kindest
service
for
lorna
came
to
the
window
at
once
to
see
what
the
cause
of
the
shout
was
and
drew
back
the
curtain
timidly
then
she
opened
the
rough
lattice
and
then
she
watched
the
cliff
and
trees
and
then
she
sighed
very
sadly
oh
lorna
dont
you
know
me
i
whispered
from
the
side
being
afraid
of
startling
her
by
appearing
over
suddenly
quick
though
she
always
was
of
thought
she
knew
me
not
from
my
whisper
and
was
shutting
the
window
hastily
when
i
caught
it
back
and
showed
myself
john
she
cried
yet
with
sense
enough
not
to
speak
aloud
oh
you
must
be
mad
john
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
said
i
without
any
news
of
my
darling
you
knew
i
would
come
of
course
you
did
well
i
thought
perhapsyou
know
now
john
you
need
not
eat
my
hand
do
you
see
they
have
put
iron
bars
across
to
be
sure
do
you
think
i
should
be
contented
even
with
this
lovely
hand
but
for
these
vile
iron
bars
i
will
have
them
out
before
i
go
now
darling
for
one
momentjust
the
other
hand
for
a
change
you
know
so
i
got
the
other
but
was
not
honest
for
i
kept
them
both
and
felt
their
delicate
beauty
trembling
as
i
laid
them
to
my
heart
oh
john
you
will
make
me
cry
directlyshe
had
been
crying
long
agoif
you
go
on
in
that
way
you
know
we
can
never
have
one
another
every
one
is
against
it
why
should
i
make
you
miserable
try
not
to
think
of
me
any
more
and
will
you
try
the
same
of
me
lorna
oh
yes
john
if
you
agree
to
it
at
least
i
will
try
to
try
it
then
you
wont
try
anything
of
the
sort
i
cried
with
great
enthusiasm
for
her
tone
was
so
nice
and
melancholy
the
only
thing
we
will
try
to
try
is
to
belong
to
one
another
and
if
we
do
our
best
lorna
god
alone
can
prevent
us
she
crossed
herself
with
one
hand
drawn
free
as
i
spoke
so
boldly
and
something
swelled
in
her
little
throat
and
prevented
her
from
answering
now
tell
me
i
said
what
means
all
this
why
are
you
so
pent
up
here
why
have
you
given
me
no
token
has
your
grandfather
turned
against
you
are
you
in
any
danger
my
poor
grandfather
is
very
ill
i
fear
that
he
will
not
live
long
the
counsellor
and
his
son
are
now
the
masters
of
the
valley
and
i
dare
not
venture
forth
for
fear
of
anything
they
might
do
to
me
when
i
went
forth
to
signal
for
you
carver
tried
to
seize
me
but
i
was
too
quick
for
him
little
gwenny
is
not
allowed
to
leave
the
valley
now
so
that
i
could
send
no
message
i
have
been
so
wretched
dear
lest
you
should
think
me
false
to
you
the
tyrants
now
make
sure
of
me
you
must
watch
this
house
both
night
and
day
if
you
wish
to
save
me
there
is
nothing
they
would
shrink
from
if
my
poor
grandfatheroh
i
cannot
bear
to
think
of
myself
when
i
ought
to
think
of
him
only
dying
without
a
son
to
tend
him
or
a
daughter
to
shed
a
tear
but
surely
he
has
sons
enough
and
a
deal
too
many
i
was
going
to
say
but
stopped
myself
in
time
why
do
none
of
them
come
to
him
i
know
not
i
cannot
tell
he
is
a
very
strange
old
man
and
few
have
ever
loved
him
he
was
black
with
wrath
at
the
counsellor
this
very
afternoonbut
i
must
not
keep
you
hereyou
are
much
too
brave
john
and
i
am
much
too
selfish
there
what
was
that
shadow
nothing
more
than
a
bat
darling
come
to
look
for
his
sweetheart
i
will
not
stay
long
you
tremble
so
and
yet
for
that
very
reason
how
can
i
leave
you

she
answered
i
shall
die
if
they
hurt

the
old
nurse

is
sure
to

from
the
window
however
it
was
only
gwenny
carfax
lornas
little
handmaid
my
darling
brought
her
to
the
window
and
presented
her
to
me
almost
laughing
through
her
grief
oh
i
am
so
glad
john
gwenny
i
am
so
glad
you
came
i
have
wanted
long
to
introduce
you
to
my
young
man
as
you
call
him
it
is
rather
dark
but
you
can
see
him
i
wish
you
to
know
him
again
gwenny
whoy
cried
gwenny
with
great
amazement
standing
on
tiptoe
to
look
out
and
staring
as
if
she
were
weighing
me
her
be
bigger
nor
any

no

twadnt
fair
play
nohow
true
enough
gwenny
i
answered
her
for
the
play
had
been
very
unfair
indeed
on
the
side
of
the
bodmin
champion
it
was
not
a
fair
bout
little
maid
i
am
free
to
acknowledge
that
by
that
answer
or
rather
by
the
construction
she
put
upon
it
the
heart
of
the
cornish
girl
was
won
more
than
by
gold
and
silver
i
shall
knoo
thee
again
young
man
no
fear
of
that
she
answered
nodding
with
an
air
of
patronage
now
missis
gae
on
coortin
and
i
wall
gae
outside
and
watch
for
ee
though
expressed
not
over
delicately
this
proposal
arose
no
doubt
from
gwennys
sense
of
delicacy
and
i
was
very
thankful
to
her
for
taking
her
departure
she
is
the
best
little
thing
in
the
world
said
lorna
softly
laughing
and
the
queerest
and
the
truest
nothing
will
bribe
her
against
me
if
she
seems
to
be
on
the
other
side
never
never
doubt
her
now
no
more
of
your
coortin
john
i
love
you
far
too
well
for
that
yes
yes
ever
so
much
if
you
will
take
a
mean
advantage
of
me
and
as
much
as
ever
you
like
to
imagine
and
then
you
may
double
it
after
that
only
go
do
go
good
john
kind
dear
darling
john
if
you
love
me
go
how
can
i
go
without
settling
anything
i
asked
very
sensibly
how
shall
i
know
of
your
danger
now
hit
upon
something
you
are
so
quick
anything
you
can
think
of
and
then
i
will
go
and
not
frighten
you
i
have
been
thinking
long
of
something
lorna
answered
rapidly
with
that
peculiar
clearness
of
voice
which
made
every
syllable
ring
like
music
of
a
several
note
you
see
that
tree
with
the
seven
rooks
nests
bright
against
the
cliffs
there
can
you
count
them
from
above
do
you
think
from
a
place
where
you
will
be
safe
dear
no
doubt
i
can
or
if
i
cannot
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
find
a
spot
whence
i
can
do
it
gwenny
can
climb
like
any
cat
she
has
been
up
there
in
the
summer
watching
the
young
birds
day
by
day
and
daring
the
boys
to
touch
them
there
are
neither
birds
nor
eggs
there
now
of
course
and
nothing
doing
if
you
see
but
six
rooks
nests
i
am
in
peril
and
want
you
if
you
see
but
five
i
am
carried
off
by
carver
good
god
said
i
at
the
mere
idea
in
a
tone
which
frightened
lorna
fear
not
john
she
whispered
sadly
and
my
blood
grew
cold
at
it
i
have
means
to
stop
him
or
at
least
to
save
myself
if
you
can
come
within
one
day
of
that
mans
getting
hold
of
me
you
will
find
me
quite
unharmed
after
that
you
will
find
me
dead
or
alive
according
to
circumstances
but
in
no
case
such
that
you
need
blush
to
look
at
me
her
dear
sweet
face
was
full
of
pride
as
even
in
the
gloom
i
saw
and
i
would
not
trespass
on
her
feelings
by
such
a
thing
at
such
a
moment
as
an
attempt
at
any
caress
i
only
said
god
bless
you
darling
and
she
said
the
same
to
me
in
a
very
low
sad
voice
and
then
i
stole
below
carvers
house
in
the
shadow
from
the
eastern
cliff
and
knowing
enough
of
the
village
now
to
satisfy
all
necessity
betook
myself
to
my
wellknown
track
in
returning
from
the
valley
which
was
neither
down
the
waterslide
a
course
i
feared
in
the
darkness
nor
up
the
cliffs
at
lornas
bower
but
a
way
of
my
own
inventing
which
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
upon
a
weight
of
care
was
off
my
mind
though
much
of
trouble
hung
there
still
one
thing
was
quite
certainif
lorna
could
not
have
john
ridd
no
one
else
should
have
her
and
my
mother
who
sat
up
for
me
and
with
me
long
time
afterwards
agreed
that
this
was
comfort
chapter
xxxviii
a
good
turn
for
jeremy
john
fry
had
now
six
shillings
a
week
of
regular
and
permanent
wage
besides
all
harvest
and
shearing
money
as
well
as
a
cottage
rentfree
and
enough
of
gardenground
to
rear
potherbs
for
his
wife
and
all
his
family
now
the
wages
appointed
by
our
justices
at
the
time
of
sessions
were
fourandsixpence
a
week
for
summer
and
a
shilling
less
for
the
wintertime
and
we
could
be
fined
and
perhaps
imprisoned
for
giving
more
than
the
sums
so
fixed
therefore
john
fry
was
looked
upon
as
the
richest
man
upon
exmoor
i
mean
of
course
among
labourers
and
there
were
many
jokes
about
robbing
him
as
if
he
were
the
mint
of
the
king
and
tom
faggus
promised
to
try
his
hand
if
he
came
across
john
on
the
highway
although
he
had
ceased
from
business
and
was
seeking
a
royal
pardon
now
is
it
according
to
human
nature
or
is
it
a
thing
contradictory
as
i
would
fain
believe
but
anyhow
there
was
upon
exmoor
no
more
discontented
man
no
man
more
sure
that
he
had
not
his
worth
neither
half
so
sore
about
it
than
or
as
john
fry
was
and
one
thing
he
did
which
i
could
not
wholly
or
indeed
i
may
say
in
any
measure
reconcile
with
my
sense
of
right
much
as
i
laboured
to
do
john
justice
especially
because
of
his
roguery
and
this
was
that
if
we
said
too
much
or
accused
him
at
all
of
laziness
which
he
must
have
known
to
be
in
him
he
regularly
turned
round
upon
us
and
quite
compelled
us
to
hold
our
tongues
by
threatening
to
lay
information
against
us
for
paying
him
too
much
wages
now
i
have
not
mentioned
all
this
of
john
fry
from
any
disrespect
for
his
memory
which
is
green
and
honest
amongst
us
far
less
from
any
desire
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
his
grandchildren
and
i
will
do
them
the
justice
once
for
all
to
avow
thus
publicly
that
i
have
known
a
great
many
bigger
rogues
and
most
of
themselves
in
the
number
but
i
have
referred
with
moderation
to
this
little
flaw
in
a
worthy
character
or
foible
as
we
call
it
when
a
man
is
dead
for
this
reason
onlythat
without
it
there
was
no
explaining
johns
dealings
with
jeremy
stickles
master
jeremy
being
full
of
london
and
norwich
experience
fell
into
the
error
of
supposing
that
we
clods
and
yokels
were
the
simplest
of
the
simple
and
could
be
cheated
at
his
good
pleasure
now
this
is
not
so
when
once
we
suspect
that
people
have
that
idea
of
us
we
indulge
them
in
it
to
the
top
of
their
bent
and
grieve
that
they
should
come
out
of
it
as
they
do
at
last
in
amazement
with
less
money
than
before
and
the
laugh
now
set
against
them
ever
since
i
had
offended
jeremy
by
threatening
him
as
before
related
in
case
of
his
meddling
with
my
affairs
he
had
more
and
more
allied
himself
with
simpleminded
john
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
him
john
fry
was
everything
it
was
run
and
fetch
my
horse
johnjohn
are
my
pistols
primed
welli
want
you
in
the
stable
john
about
something
very
particular
until
except
for
the
rudeness
of
it
i
was
longing
to
tell
master
stickles
that
he
ought
to
pay
johns
wages
john
for
his
part
was
not
backward
but
gave
himself
the
most
wonderful
airs
of
secrecy
and
importance
till
half
the
parish
began
to
think
that
the
affairs
of
the
nation
were
in
his
hand
and
he
scorned
the
sight
of
a
dungfork
it
was
not
likely
that
this
should
last
and
being
the
only
man
in
the
parish
with
any
knowledge
of
politics
i
gave
john
fry
to
understand
that
he
must
not
presume
to
talk
so
freely
as
if
he
were
at
least
a
constable
about
the
constitution
which
could
be
no
affair
of
his
and
might
bring
us
all
into
trouble
at
this
he
only
tossed
his
nose
as
if
he
had
been
in
london
at
least
three
times
for
my
one
which
vexed
me
so
that
i
promised
him
the
thick
end
of
the
ploughwhip
if
even
the
name
of
a
knight
of
the
shire
should
pass
his
lips
for
a
fortnight
now
i
did
not
suspect
in
my
stupid
noddle
that
john
fry
would
ever
tell
jeremy
stickles
about
the
sight
at
the
wizards
slough
and
the
man
in
the
white
nightcap
because
john
had
sworn
on
the
blade
of
his
knife
not
to
breathe
a
word
to
any
soul
without
my
full
permission
however
it
appears
that
john
related
for
a
certain
consideration
all
that
he
had
seen
and
doubtless
more
which
had
accrued
to
it
upon
this
master
stickles
was
much
astonished
at
uncle
reubens
proceedings
having
always
accounted
him
a
most
loyal
keen
and
wary
subject
all
this
i
learned
upon
recovering
jeremys
good
graces
which
came
to
pass
in
no
other
way
than
by
the
saving
of
his
life
being
bound
to
keep
the
strictest
watch
upon
the
seven
rooks
nests
and
yet
not
bearing
to
be
idle
and
to
waste
my
mothers
stores
i
contrived
to
keep
my
work
entirely
at
the
western
corner
of
our
farm
which
was
nearest
to
glen
doone
and
whence
i
could
easily
run
to
a
height
commanding
the
view
i
coveted
one
day
squire
faggus
had
dropped
in
upon
us
just
in
time
for
dinner
and
very
soon
he
and
kings
messenger
were
as
thick
as
need
be
tom
had
brought
his
beloved
mare
to
show
her
off
to
annie
and
he
mounted
his
pretty
sweetheart
upon
her
after
giving
winnie
notice
to
be
on
her
very
best
behaviour
the
squire
was
in
great
spirits
having
just
accomplished
a
purchase
of
land
which
was
worth
ten
times
what
he
gave
for
it
and
this
he
did
by
a
merry
trick
upon
old
sir
roger
bassett
who
never
supposed
him
to
be
in
earnest
as
not
possessing
the
money
the
whole
thing
was
done
on
a
bumper
of
claret
in
a
tavern
where
they
met
and
the
old
knight
having
once
pledged
his
word
no
lawyers
could
hold
him
back
from
it
they
could
only
say
that
master
faggus
being
attainted
of
felony
was
not
a
capable
grantee
i
will
soon
cure
that
quoth
tom
my
pardon
has
been
ready
for
months
and
months
so
soon
as
i
care
to
sue
it
and
now
he
was
telling
our
annie
who
listened
very
rosily
and
believed
every
word
he
said
that
having
been
ruined
in
early
innocence
by
the
means
of
lawyers
it
was
only
just
and
fair
turn
for
turn
that
having
become
a
match
for
them
by
long
practice
upon
the
highway
he
should
reinstate
himself
at
their
expense
in
society
and
now
he
would
go
to
london
at
once
and
sue
out
his
pardon
and
then
would
his
lovely
darling
annie
etc
etcthings
which
i
had
no
right
to
hear
and
in
which
i
was
not
wanted
therefore
i
strode
away
up
the
lane
to
my
afternoons
employment
sadly
comparing
my
love
with
theirs
which
now
appeared
so
prosperous
yet
heartily
glad
for
annies
sake
only
remembering
now
and
then
the
old
proverb
wrong
never
comes
right
i
worked
very
hard
in
the
copse
of
young
ash
with
my
billhook
and
a
shearingknife
cutting
out
the
saplings
where
they
stooled
too
close
together
making
spars
to
keep
for
thatching
wallcrooks
to
drive
into
the
cob
stiles
for
close
sheep
hurdles
and
handles
for
rakes
and
hoes
and
twobills
of
the
larger
and
straighter
stuff
and
all
the
lesser
i
bound
in
faggots
to
come
home
on
the
sledd
to
the
woodrick
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
i
did
all
this
work
without
many
peeps
at
the
seven
rooks
nests
which
proved
my
lornas
safety
indeed
whenever
i
wanted
a
change
either
from
cleaving
or
hewing
too
hard
or
stooping
too
much
at
binding
i
was
up
and
away
to
the
ridge
of
the
hill
instead
of
standing
and
doing
nothing
soon
i
forgot
about
tom
and
annie
and
fell
to
thinking
of
lorna
only
and
how
much
i
would
make
of
her
and
what
i
should
call
our
children
and
how
i
would
educate
them
to
do
honour
to
her
rank
yet
all
the
time
i
worked
none
the
worse
by
reason
of
meditation
freshcut
spars
are
not
so
good
as
those
of
a
little
seasoning
especially
if
the
sap
was
not
gone
down
at
the
time
of
cutting
therefore
we
always
find
it
needful
to
have
plenty
still
in
stock
it
was
very
pleasant
there
in
the
copse
sloping
to
the
west
as
it
was
and
the
sun
descending
brightly
with
rocks
and
banks
to
dwell
upon
the
stems
of
mottled
and
dimpled
wood
with
twigs
coming
out
like
elbows
hung
and
clung
together
closely
with
a
mode
of
bending
in
as
children
do
at
some
danger
overhead
the
shrunken
leaves
quivered
and
rustled
ripely
having
many
points
like
stars
and
rising
and
falling
delicately
as
fingers
play
sad
music
along
the
bed
of
the
slanting
ground
all
between
the
stools
of
wood
there
were
heaps
of
dead
brown
leaves
and
sheltered
mats
of
lichen
and
drifts
of
spotted
stick
gone
rotten
and
tufts
of
rushes
here
and
there
full
of
fray
and
feathering
all
by
the
hedge
ran
a
little
stream
a
thing
that
could
barely
name
itself
flowing
scarce
more
than
a
pint
in
a
minute
because
of
the
sunny
weather
yet
had
this
rill
little
crooks
and
crannies
dark
and
bravely
bearded
and
a
gallant
rush
through
a
reeden
pipethe
stem
of
a
flag
that
was
grounded
and
here
and
there
divided
threads
from
the
points
of
a
branching
stick
into
mighty
pools
of
rock
as
large
as
a
grown
mans
hat
almost
napped
with
moss
all
around
the
sides
and
hung
with
corded
grasses
along
and
down
the
tiny
banks
and
nodding
into
one
another
even
across
main
channel
hung
the
brown
arcade
of
ferns
some
with
gold
tongues
languishing
some
with
countless
eardrops
jerking
some
with
great
quilled
ribs
uprising
and
long
saws
aflapping
others
cupped
and
fanning
over
with
the
grace
of
yielding
even
as
a
hollow
fountain
spread
by
winds
that
have
lost
their
way
deeply
each
beyond
other
pluming
stooping
glancing
glistening
weaving
softest
pillow
lace
coying
to
the
wind
and
water
when
their
fleeting
image
danced
or
by
which
their
beauty
movedgod
has
made
no
lovelier
thing
and
only
he
takes
heed
of
them
it
was
time
to
go
home
to
supper
now
and
i
felt
very
friendly
towards
it
having
been
hard
at
work
for
some
hours
with
only
the
voice
of
the
little
rill
and
some
hares
and
a
pheasant
for
company
the
sun
was
gone
down
behind
the
black
wood
on
the
farther
cliffs
of
bagworthy
and
the
russet
of
the
tufts
and
spearbeds
was
becoming
gray
while
the
greyness
of
the
sapling
ash
grew
brown
against
the
sky
the
hollow
curves
of
the
little
stream
became
black
beneath
the
grasses
and
the
fairy
fans
innumerable
while
outside
the
hedge
our
clover
was
crimping
its
leaves
in
the
dewfall
like
the
cocked
hats
of
woodsorrelwhen
thanking
god
for
all
this
scene
because
my
love
had
gifted
me
with
the
key
to
all
things
lovely
i
prepared
to
follow
their
example
and
to
rest
from
labour
therefore
i
wiped
my
billhook
and
shearingknife
very
carefully
for
i
hate
to
leave
tools
dirty
and
was
doubting
whether
i
should
try
for
another
glance
at
the
seven
rooks
nests
or
whether
it
would
be
too
dark
for
it
it
was
now
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mayhap
since
i
had
made
any
chopping
noise
because
i
had
been
assorting
my
spars
and
tying
them
in
bundles
instead
of
plying
the
billhook
and
the
gentle
tinkle
of
the
stream
was
louder
than
my
doings
to
this
no
doubt
i
owe
my
life
which
then
without
my
dreaming
it
was
in
no
little
jeopardy
for
just
as
i
was
twisting
the
bine
of
my
very
last
faggot
before
tucking
the
cleft
tongue
under
there
came
three
men
outside
the
hedge
where
the
western
light
was
yellow
and
by
it
i
could
see
that
all
three
of
them
carried
firearms
these
men
were
not
walking
carelessly
but
following
down
the
hedgetrough
as
if
to
stalk
some
enemy
and
for
a
moment
it
struck
me
cold
to
think
it
was
i
they
were
looking
for
with
the
swiftness
of
terror
i
concluded
that
my
visits
to
glen
doone
were
known
and
now
my
life
was
the
forfeit
it
was
a
most
lucky
thing
for
me
that
i
heard
their
clothes
catch
in
the
brambles
and
saw
their
hats
under
the
rampart
of
ash
which
is
made
by
what
we
call
splashing
and
lucky
for
me
that
i
stood
in
a
goyal
and
had
the
dark
coppice
behind
me
to
this
i
had
no
time
to
fly
but
with
a
sort
of
instinct
threw
myself
flat
in
among
the
thick
fern
and
held
my
breath
and
lay
still
as
a
log
for
i
had
seen
the
light
gleam
on
their
gunbarrels
and
knowing
the
faults
of
the
neighbourhood
would
fain
avoid
swelling
their
number
then
the
three
men
came
to
the
gap
in
the
hedge
where
i
had
been
in
and
out
so
often
and
stood
up
and
looked
in
over
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
man
to
boast
that
in
all
his
life
he
has
never
been
frightened
and
believes
that
he
never
could
be
so
there
may
be
men
of
that
naturei
will
not
dare
to
deny
it
only
i
have
never
known
them
the
fright
i
was
now
in
was
horrible
and
all
my
bones
seemed
to
creep
inside
me
when
lying
there
helpless
with
only
a
billet
and
the
comb
of
fern
to
hide
me
in
the
dusk
of
early
evening
i
saw
three
faces
in
the
gap
and
what
was
worse
three
gunmuzzles
somebody
been
at
work
here
it
was
the
deep
voice
of
carver
doone
jump
up
charlie
and
look
about
we
must
have
no
witnesses
give
me
a
hand
behind
said
charlie
the
same
handsome
young
doone
i
had
seen
that
night
this
bank
is
too
devilish
steep
for
me
nonsense
man
cried
marwood
de
whichehalse
who
to
my
amazement
was
the
third
of
the
number
only
a
hind
cutting
faggots
and
of
course
he
hath
gone
home
long
ago
blind
mans
holiday
as
we
call
it
i
can
see
all
over
the
place
and
there
is
not
even
a
rabbit
there
at
that
i
drew
my
breath
again
and
thanked
god
i
had
gotten
my
coat
on
squire
is
right
said
charlie
who
was
standing
up
high
on
a
root
perhaps
there
is
nobody
there
now
captain
and
lucky
for
the
poor
devil
that
he
keepeth
workmans
hours
even
his
chopper
is
gone
i
see
no
dog
no
man
is
the
rule
about
here
when
it
comes
to
coppice
work
continued
young
de
whichehalse
there
is
not
a
man
would
dare
work
there
without
a
dog
to
scare
the
pixies
there
is
a
big
young
fellow
upon
this
farm
carver
doone
muttered
sulkily
with
whom
i
have
an
account
to
settle
if
ever
i
come
across
him
he
hath
a
cursed
spite
to
us
because
we
shot
his
father
he
was
going
to
bring
the
lumpers
upon
us
only
he
was
afeared
last
winter
and
he
hath
been
in
london
lately
for
some
traitorous
job
i
doubt
oh
you
mean
that
fool
john
ridd
answered
the
young
squire
a
very
simple
clodhopper
no
treachery
in
him
i
warrant
he
hath
not
the
head
for
it
all
he
cares
about
is
wrestling
as
strong
as
a
bull
and
with
no
more
brains
a
bullet
for
that
bull
said
carver
and
i
could
see
the
grin
on
his
scornful
face
a
bullet
for
ballast
to
his
brain
the
first
time
i
come
across
him
nonsense
captain
i
wont
have
him
shot
for
he
is
my
old
schoolfellow
and
hath
a
very
pretty
sister
but
his
cousin
is
of
a
different
mould
and
ten
times
as
dangerous
we
shall
see
lads
we
shall
see
grumbled
the
great
blackbearded
man
ill
bodes
for
the
fool
that
would
hinder
me
but
come
let
us
onward
no
lingering
or
the
viper
will
be
in
the
bush
from
us
body
and
soul
if
he
give
us
the
slip
both
of
you
shall
answer
it
no
fear
captain
and
no
hurry
charlie
answered
gallantly
would
i
were
as
sure
of
living
a
twelvemonth
as
he
is
of
dying
within
the
hour
extreme
unction
for
him
in
my
bullet
patch
remember
i
claim
to
be
his
confessor
because
he
hath
insulted
me
thou
art
welcome
to
the
job
for
me
said
marwood
as
they
turned
away
and
kept
along
the
hedgerow
i
love
to
meet
a
man
sword
to
sword
not
to
pop
at
him
from
a
foxhole
what
answer
was
made
i
could
not
hear
for
by
this
time
the
stout
ashen
hedge
was
between
us
and
no
other
gap
to
be
found
in
it
until
at
the
very
bottom
where
the
corner
of
the
copse
was
yet
i
was
not
quit
of
danger
now
for
they
might
come
through
that
second
gap
and
then
would
be
sure
to
see
me
unless
i
crept
into
the
uncut
thicket
before
they
could
enter
the
clearing
but
in
spite
of
all
my
fear
i
was
not
wise
enough
to
do
that
and
in
truth
the
words
of
carver
doone
had
filled
me
with
such
anger
knowing
what
i
did
about
him
and
his
pretence
to
lorna
and
the
sight
of
squire
marwood
in
such
outrageous
company
had
so
moved
my
curiosity
and
their
threats
against
some
unknown
person
so
aroused
my
pity
that
much
of
my
prudence
was
forgotten
or
at
least
the
better
part
of
courage
which
loves
danger
at
long
distance
therefore
holding
fast
my
billhook
i
dropped
myself
very
quietly
into
the
bed
of
the
runnel
being
resolved
to
take
my
chance
of
their
entrance
at
the
corner
where
the
water
dived
through
the
hedgerow
and
so
i
followed
them
down
the
fence
as
gently
as
a
rabbit
goes
only
i
was
inside
it
and
they
on
the
outside
but
yet
so
near
that
i
heard
the
branches
rustle
as
they
pushed
them
perhaps
i
had
never
loved
ferns
so
much
as
when
i
came
to
the
end
of
that
little
gully
and
stooped
betwixt
two
patches
of
them
now
my
chiefest
shelter
for
cattle
had
been
through
the
gap
just
there
in
quest
of
fodder
and
coolness
and
had
left
but
a
mound
of
trodden
earth
between
me
and
the
outlaws
i
mean
at
least
on
my
left
hand
upon
which
side
they
were
for
in
front
where
the
brook
ran
out
of
the
copse
was
a
good
stiff
hedge
of
holly
and
now
i
prayed
heaven
to
lead
them
straight
on
for
if
they
once
turned
to
their
right
through
the
gap
the
muzzles
of
their
guns
would
come
almost
against
my
forehead
i
heard
them
for
i
durst
not
look
and
could
scarce
keep
still
for
tremblingi
heard
them
trampling
outside
the
gap
uncertain
which
track
they
should
follow
and
in
that
fearful
moment
with
my
soul
almost
looking
out
of
my
body
expecting
notice
to
quit
it
what
do
you
think
i
did
i
counted
the
threads
in
a
spiders
web
and
the
flies
he
had
lately
eaten
as
their
skeletons
shook
in
the
twilight
we
shall
see
him
better
in
there
said
carver
in
his
horrible
gruff
voice
like
the
creaking
of
the
gallows
chain
sit
there
behind
holly
hedge
lads
while
he
cometh
down
yonder
hill
and
then
our
goodevening
to
him
one
at
his
body
and
two
at
his
head
and
good
aim
lest
we
baulk
the
devil
i
tell
you
captain
that
will
not
do
said
charlie
almost
whispering
you
are
very
proud
of
your
skill
we
know
and
can
hit
a
lark
if
you
see
it
but
he
may
not
come
until
after
dark
and
we
cannot
be
too
nigh
to
him
this
holly
hedge
is
too
far
away
he
crosses
down
here
from
slocomslade
not
from
tibbacot
i
tell
you
but
along
that
track
to
the
left
there
and
so
by
the
foreland
to
glenthorne
where
his
boat
is
in
the
cove
do
you
think
i
have
tracked
him
so
many
evenings
without
knowing
his
line
to
a
hair
will
you
fool
away
all
my
trouble
come
then
lad
we
will
follow
thy
lead
thy
life
for
his
if
we
fail
of
it
after
me
then
right
into
the
hollow
thy
legs
are
growing
stiff
captain
so
shall
thy
body
be
young
man
if
thou
leadest
me
astray
in
this
i
heard
them
stumbling
down
the
hill
which
was
steep
and
rocky
in
that
part
and
peering
through
the
hedge
i
saw
them
enter
a
covert
by
the
side
of
the
track
which
master
stickles
followed
almost
every
evening
when
he
left
our
house
upon
business
and
then
i
knew
who
it
was
they
were
come
on
purpose
to
murdera
thing
which
i
might
have
guessed
long
before
but
for
terror
and
cold
stupidity
oh
that
god
i
thought
for
a
moment
waiting
for
my
blood
to
flow
oh
that
god
had
given
me
brains
to
meet
such
cruel
dastards
according
to
their
villainy
the
power
to
lie
and
the
love
of
it
the
stealth
to
spy
and
the
glory
in
it
above
all
the
quiet
relish
for
blood
and
joy
in
the
death
of
an
enemythese
are
what
any
man
must
have
to
contend
with
the
doones
upon
even
terms
and
yet
i
thank
god
that
i
have
not
any
of
these
it
was
no
time
to
dwell
upon
that
only
to
try
if
might
be
to
prevent
the
crime
they
were
bound
upon
to
follow
the
armed
men
down
the
hill
would
have
been
certain
death
to
me
because
there
was
no
covert
there
and
the
last
light
hung
upon
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
only
chance
to
stop
the
mischief
pending
was
to
compass
the
round
of
the
hill
as
fast
as
feet
could
be
laid
to
ground
only
keeping
out
of
sight
from
the
valley
and
then
down
the
rocks
and
across
the
brook
to
the
track
from
slocombslade
so
as
to
stop
the
kings
messenger
from
travelling
any
farther
if
only
i
could
catch
him
there
and
this
was
exactly
what
i
did
and
a
terrible
run
i
had
for
it
fearing
at
every
step
to
hear
the
echo
of
shots
in
the
valley
and
dropping
down
the
scrubby
rocks
with
tearing
and
violent
scratching
then
i
crossed
bagworthy
stream
not
far
below
doonevalley
and
breasted
the
hill
towards
slocombslade
with
my
heart
very
heavily
panting
why
jeremy
chose
to
ride
this
way
instead
of
the
more
direct
one
which
would
have
been
over
oarehill
was
more
than
i
could
account
for
but
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
all
i
wanted
was
to
save
his
life
and
this
i
did
by
about
a
minute
and
which
was
the
hardest
thing
of
all
with
a
great
horsepistol
at
my
head
as
i
seized
upon
his
bridle
jeremy
jerry
was
all
i
could
say
being
so
fearfully
short
of
breath
for
i
had
crossed
the
ground
quicker
than
any
horse
could
spoken
just
in
time
john
ridd
cried
master
stickles
still
however
pointing
the
pistol
at
me
i
might
have
known
thee
by
thy
size
john
what
art
doing
here
come
to
save
your
life
for
gods
sake
go
no
farther
three
men
in
the
covert
there
with
long
guns
waiting
for
thee
ha
i
have
been
watched
of
late
that
is
why
i
pointed
at
thee
john
back
round
this
corner
and
get
thy
breath
and
tell
me
all
about
it
i
never
saw
a
man
so
hurried
i
could
beat
thee
now
john
jeremy
stickles
was
a
man
of
courage
and
presence
of
mind
and
much
resource
otherwise
he
would
not
have
been
appointed
for
this
business
nevertheless
he
trembled
greatly
when
he
heard
what
i
had
to
tell
him
but
i
took
good
care
to
keep
back
the
name
of
young
marwood
de
whichehalse
neither
did
i
show
my
knowledge
of
the
other
men
for
reasons
of
my
own
not
very
hard
to
conjecture
we
will
let
them
cool
their
heels
john
ridd
said
jeremy
after
thinking
a
little
i
cannot
fetch
my
musketeers
either
from
glenthorne
or
lynmouth
in
time
to
seize
the
fellows
and
three
desperate
doones
wellarmed
are
too
many
for
you
and
me
one
result
this
attempt
will
have
it
will
make
us
attack
them
sooner
than
we
had
intended
and
one
more
it
will
have
good
john
it
will
make
me
thy
friend
for
ever
shake
hands
my
lad
and
forgive
me
freely
for
having
been
so
cold
to
thee
mayhap
in
the
troubles
coming
it
will
help
thee
not
a
little
to
have
done
me
this
good
turn
upon
this
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
with
a
pressure
such
as
we
feel
not
often
and
having
learned
from
me
how
to
pass
quite
beyond
view
of
his
enemies
he
rode
on
to
his
duty
whatever
it
might
be
for
my
part
i
was
inclined
to
stay
and
watch
how
long
the
three
fusiliers
would
have
the
patience
to
lie
in
wait
but
seeing
less
and
less
use
in
that
as
i
grew
more
and
more
hungry
i
swung
my
coat
about
me
and
went
home
to
plovers
barrows
chapter
xxxix
troubled
state
and
a
foolish
joke
stickles
took
me
aside
the
next
day
and
opened
all
his
business
to
me
whether
i
would
or
not
but
i
gave
him
clearly
to
understand
that
he
was
not
to
be
vexed
with
me
neither
to
regard
me
as
in
any
way
dishonest
if
i
should
use
for
my
own
purpose
or
for
the
benefit
of
my
friends
any
part
of
the
knowledge
and
privity
thus
enforced
upon
me
to
this
he
agreed
quite
readily
but
upon
the
express
provision
that
i
should
do
nothing
to
thwart
his
schemes
neither
unfold
them
to
any
one
but
otherwise
be
allowed
to
act
according
to
my
own
conscience
and
as
consisted
with
the
honour
of
a
loyal
gentlemanfor
so
he
was
pleased
to
term
me
now
what
he
said
lay
in
no
great
compass
and
may
be
summed
in
smaller
still
especially
as
people
know
the
chief
part
of
it
already
disaffection
to
the
king
or
rather
dislike
to
his
brother
james
and
fear
of
roman
ascendancy
had
existed
now
for
several
years
and
of
late
were
spreading
rapidly
partly
through
the
downright
arrogance
of
the
tory
faction
the
cruelty
and
austerity
of
the
duke
of
york
the
corruption
of
justice
and
confiscation
of
ancient
rights
and
charters
partly
through
jealousy
of
the
french
king
and
his
potent
voice
in
our
affairs
and
partly
or
perhaps
one
might
even
say
mainly
through
that
natural
tide
in
all
political
channels
which
verily
moves
as
if
it
had
the
moon
itself
for
its
mistress
no
sooner
is
a
thing
done
and
fixed
being
set
far
in
advance
perhaps
of
all
that
was
done
before
like
a
new
mole
in
the
sea
but
immediately
the
waters
retire
lest
they
should
undo
it
and
every
one
says
how
fine
it
is
but
leaves
other
people
to
walk
on
it
then
after
awhile
the
vague
endless
ocean
having
retired
and
lain
still
without
a
breeze
or
murmur
frets
and
heaves
again
with
impulse
or
with
lashes
laid
on
it
and
in
one
great
surge
advances
over
every
rampart
and
so
there
was
at
the
time
i
speak
of
a
great
surge
in
england
not
rolling
yet
but
seething
and
one
which
a
thousand
chief
justices
and
a
million
jeremy
stickles
should
never
be
able
to
stop
or
turn
by
stringing
up
men
in
front
of
it
any
more
than
a
rope
of
onions
can
repulse
a
volcano
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
this
great
movement
took
a
wrong
channel
at
first
not
only
missing
legitimate
line
but
roaring
out
that
the
back
ditchway
was
the
true
and
established
course
of
it
against
this
rash
and
random
current
nearly
all
the
ancient
mariners
of
the
state
were
set
not
to
allow
the
brave
ship
to
drift
there
though
some
little
boats
might
try
it
for
the
present
there
seemed
to
be
a
pause
with
no
open
onset
but
people
on
the
shore
expecting
each
according
to
his
wishes
and
the
feel
of
his
own
finger
whence
the
rush
of
wind
should
come
which
might
direct
the
water
nowto
reduce
high
figures
of
speech
into
our
own
little
numeralsall
the
towns
of
somersetshire
and
half
the
towns
of
devonshire
were
full
of
pushing
eager
people
ready
to
swallow
anything
or
to
make
others
swallow
it
whether
they
believed
the
folly
about
the
black
box
and
all
that
stuff
is
not
for
me
to
say
only
one
thing
i
know
they
pretended
to
do
so
and
persuaded
the
ignorant
rustics
taunton
bridgwater
minehead
and
dulverton
took
the
lead
of
the
other
towns
in
utterance
of
their
discontent
and
threats
of
what
they
meant
to
do
if
ever
a
papist
dared
to
climb
the
protestant
throne
of
england
on
the
other
hand
the
tory
leaders
were
not
as
yet
under
apprehension
of
an
immediate
outbreak
and
feared
to
damage
their
own
cause
by
premature
coercion
for
the
struggle
was
not
very
likely
to
begin
in
earnest
during
the
life
of
the
present
king
unless
he
should
as
some
people
hoped
be
so
far
emboldened
as
to
make
public
profession
of
the
faith
which
he
held
if
any
so
the
tory
policy
was
to
watch
not
indeed
permitting
their
opponents
to
gather
strength
and
muster
in
armed
force
or
with
order
but
being
well
apprised
of
all
their
schemes
and
intended
movements
to
wait
for
some
bold
overt
act
and
then
to
strike
severely
and
as
a
tory
watchmanor
spy
as
the
whigs
would
call
himjeremy
stickles
was
now
among
us
and
his
duty
was
threefold
first
and
most
ostensibly
to
see
to
the
levying
of
poundage
in
the
little
haven
of
lynmouth
and
farther
up
the
coast
which
was
now
becoming
a
place
of
resort
for
the
folk
whom
we
call
smugglers
that
is
to
say
who
land
their
goods
without
regard
to
kings
revenue
as
by
law
established
and
indeed
there
had
been
no
officer
appointed
to
take
toll
until
one
had
been
sent
to
minehead
not
so
very
long
before
the
excise
as
well
which
had
been
ordered
in
the
time
of
the
long
parliament
had
been
little
heeded
by
the
people
hereabouts
second
his
duty
was
though
only
the
doones
had
discovered
it
to
watch
those
outlaws
narrowly
and
report
of
their
manners
which
were
scanty
doings
which
were
too
manifold
reputation
which
was
execrable
and
politics
whether
true
to
the
king
and
the
pope
or
otherwise
jeremy
stickles
third
business
was
entirely
political
to
learn
the
temper
of
our
people
and
the
gentle
families
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
trained
bands
which
could
not
always
be
trusted
to
discover
any
collecting
of
arms
and
drilling
of
men
among
us
to
prevent
if
need
were
by
open
force
any
importation
of
gunpowder
of
which
there
had
been
some
rumour
in
a
word
to
observe
and
forestall
the
enemy
now
in
providing
for
this
lastmentioned
service
the
government
had
made
a
great
mistake
doubtless
through
their
anxiety
to
escape
any
public
attention
for
all
the
disposable
force
at
their
emissarys
command
amounted
to
no
more
than
a
score
of
musketeers
and
these
so
divided
along
the
coast
as
scarcely
to
suffice
for
the
duty
of
sentinels
he
held
a
commission
it
is
true
for
the
employment
of
the
trainbands
but
upon
the
understanding
that
he
was
not
to
call
upon
them
except
as
a
last
resource
for
any
political
object
although
he
might
use
them
against
the
doones
as
private
criminals
if
found
needful
and
supposing
that
he
could
get
them
so
you
see
john
he
said
in
conclusion
i
have
more
work
than
tools
to
do
it
with
i
am
heartily
sorry
i
ever
accepted
such
a
mixed
and
meagre
commission
at
the
bottom
of
it
lies
i
am
well
convinced
not
only
the
desire
to
keep
things
quiet
but
the
paltry
jealousy
of
the
military
people
because
i
am
not
a
colonel
forsooth
or
a
captain
in
his
majestys
service
it
would
never
do
to
trust
me
with
a
company
of
soldiers
and
yet
they
would
not
send
either
colonel
or
captain
for
fear
of
a
stir
in
the
rustic
mind
the
only
thing
that
i
can
do
with
any
chance
of
success
is
to
rout
out
these
vile
doone
fellows
and
burn
their
houses
over
their
heads
now
what
think
you
of
that
john
ridd
destroy
the
town
of
the
doones
i
said
and
all
the
doones
inside
it
surely
jeremy
you
would
never
think
of
such
a
cruel
act
as
that
a
cruel
act
john
it
would
be
a
mercy
for
at
least
three
counties
no
doubt
you
folk
who
live
so
near
are
well
accustomed
to
them
and
would
miss
your
liveliness
in
coming
home
after
nightfall
and
the
joy
of
finding
your
sheep
and
cattle
right
when
you
not
expected
it
but
after
awhile
you
might
get
used
to
the
dullness
of
being
safe
in
your
beds
and
not
losing
your
sisters
and
sweethearts
surely
on
the
whole
it
is
as
pleasant
not
to
be
robbed
as
to
be
robbed
i
think
we
should
miss
them
very
much
i
answered
after
consideration
for
the
possibility
of
having
no
doones
had
never
yet
occurred
to
me
and
we
all
were
so
thoroughly
used
to
them
and
allowed
for
it
in
our
years
reckoning
i
am
sure
we
should
miss
them
very
sadly
and
something
worse
would
come
of
it
thou
art
the
staunchest
of
all
staunch
tories
cried
stickles
laughing
as
he
shook
my
hand
thou
believest
in
the
divine
right
of
robbers
who
are
good
enough
to
steal
thy
own
fat
sheep
i
am
a
jolly
tory
john
but
thou
art
ten
times
jollier
oh
the
grief
in
thy
face
at
the
thought
of
being
robbed
no
longer
he
laughed
in
a
very
unseemly
manner
while
i
descried
nothing
to
laugh
about
for
we
always
like
to
see
our
way
and
a
sudden
change
upsets
us
and
unless
it
were
in
the
loss
of
the
farm
or
the
death
of
the
king
or
of
betty
muxworthy
there
was
nothing
that
could
so
unsettle
our
minds
as
the
loss
of
the
doones
of
bagworthy
and
beside
all
this
i
was
thinking
of
course
and
thinking
more
than
all
the
rest
about
the
troubles
that
might
ensue
to
my
own
beloved
lorna
if
an
attack
of
glen
doone
were
made
by
savage
soldiers
and
rude
trainbands
what
might
happen
or
what
might
not
to
my
delicate
innocent
darling
therefore
when
jeremy
stickles
again
placed
the
matter
before
me
commending
my
strength
and
courage
and
skill
to
flatter
me
of
the
highest
and
finished
by
saying
that
i
would
be
worth
at
least
four
common
men
to
him
i
cut
him
short
as
follows
master
stickles
once
for
all
i
will
have
naught
to
do
with
it
the
reason
why
is
no
odds
of
thine
nor
in
any
way
disloyal
only
in
thy
plans
remember
that
i
will
not
strike
a
blow
neither
give
any
counsel
neither
guard
any
prisoners
not
strike
a
blow
cried
jeremy
against
thy
fathers
murderers
john
not
a
single
blow
jeremy
unless
i
knew
the
man
who
did
it
and
he
gloried
in
his
sin
it
was
a
foul
and
dastard
deed
yet
not
done
in
cold
blood
neither
in
cold
blood
will
i
take
gods
task
of
avenging
it
very
well
john
answered
master
stickles
i
know
thine
obstinacy
when
thy
mind
is
made
up
to
argue
with
thee
is
pelting
a
rock
with
peppercorns
but
thou
hast
some
other
reason
lad
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
over
and
above
thy
merciful
nature
and
christian
forgiveness
anyhow
come
and
see
it
john
there
will
be
good
sport
i
reckon
especially
when
we
thrust
our
claws
into
the
nest
of
the
ravens
many
a
yeoman
will
find
his
daughter
and
some
of
the
porlock
lads
their
sweethearts
a
nice
young
maiden
now
for
thee
john
if
indeed
any
no
more
of
this
i
answered
very
sternly
it
is
no
business
of
thine
jeremy
and
i
will
have
no
joking
upon
this
matter
good
my
lord
so
be
it
but
one
thing
i
tell
thee
in
earnest
we
will
have
thy
old
doubledealing
uncle
huckaback
of
dulverton
and
march
him
first
to
assault
doone
castle
sure
as
my
name
is
stickles
i
hear
that
he
hath
often
vowed
to
storm
the
valley
himself
if
only
he
could
find
a
dozen
musketeers
to
back
him
now
we
will
give
him
chance
to
do
it
and
prove
his
loyalty
to
the
king
which
lies
under
some
suspicion
of
late
with
regard
to
this
i
had
nothing
to
say
for
it
seemed
to
me
very
reasonable
that
uncle
reuben
should
have
first
chance
of
recovering
his
stolen
goods
about
which
he
had
made
such
a
sad
todo
and
promised
himself
such
vengeance
i
made
bold
however
to
ask
master
stickles
at
what
time
he
intended
to
carry
out
this
great
and
hazardous
attempt
he
answered
that
he
had
several
things
requiring
first
to
be
set
in
order
and
that
he
must
make
an
inland
journey
even
as
far
as
tiverton
and
perhaps
crediton
and
exeter
to
collect
his
forces
and
ammunition
for
them
for
he
meant
to
have
some
of
the
yeomanry
as
well
as
of
the
trained
bands
so
that
if
the
doones
should
sally
forth
as
perhaps
they
would
on
horseback
cavalry
might
be
there
to
meet
them
and
cut
them
off
from
returning
all
this
made
me
very
uncomfortable
for
many
and
many
reasons
the
chief
and
foremost
being
of
course
my
anxiety
about
lorna
if
the
attack
succeeded
what
was
to
become
of
her
who
would
rescue
her
from
the
brutal
soldiers
even
supposing
that
she
escaped
from
the
hands
of
her
own
people
during
the
danger
and
ferocity
and
in
smaller
ways
i
was
much
put
out
for
instance
who
would
ensure
our
cornricks
sheep
and
cattle
ay
and
even
our
fat
pigs
now
coming
on
for
bacon
against
the
spreading
all
over
the
country
of
unlicensed
marauders
the
doones
had
their
rights
and
understood
them
and
took
them
according
to
prescription
even
as
the
parsons
had
and
the
lords
of
manors
and
the
king
himself
god
save
him
but
how
were
these
low
soldiering
fellows
halfstarved
at
home
very
likely
and
only
too
glad
of
the
fat
of
the
land
and
ready
according
to
our
proverb
to
burn
the
paper
they
fried
in
who
were
they
to
come
hectoring
and
heroing
over
us
and
heliogabalising
with
our
pretty
sisters
to
cook
for
them
and
be
chucked
under
chin
perhaps
afterwards
there
is
nothing
england
hates
so
much
according
to
my
sense
of
it
as
that
fellows
taken
from
ploughtail
carttail
pothouses
and
parishstocks
should
be
hoisted
and
foisted
upon
us
after
a
few
months
drilling
and
their
lying
shaped
into
truckling
as
defenders
of
the
public
weal
and
heroes
of
the
universe
in
another
way
i
was
vexed
moreoverfor
after
all
we
must
consider
the
opinions
of
our
neighboursnamely
that
i
knew
quite
well
how
everybody
for
ten
miles
round
for
my
fame
must
have
been
at
least
that
wide
after
all
my
wrestling
would
lift
up
hands
and
cry
out
thusblack
shame
on
john
ridd
if
he
lets
them
go
without
him
putting
all
these
things
together
as
well
as
many
others
which
your
own
wits
will
suggest
to
you
it
is
impossible
but
what
you
will
freely
acknowledge
that
this
unfortunate
john
ridd
was
now
in
a
cloven
stick
there
was
lorna
my
love
and
life
bound
by
her
duty
to
that
old
vilnay
i
mean
to
her
good
grandfather
who
could
now
do
little
mischief
and
therefore
deserved
all
praiselorna
bound
at
any
rate
by
her
womanly
feelings
if
not
by
sense
of
duty
to
remain
in
the
thick
danger
with
nobody
to
protect
her
but
everybody
to
covet
her
for
beauty
and
position
here
was
all
the
country
roused
with
violent
excitement
at
the
chance
of
snapping
at
the
doones
and
not
only
getting
tit
for
tat
but
every
young
man
promising
his
sweetheart
a
gold
chain
and
his
mother
at
least
a
shilling
and
here
was
our
own
mowyard
better
filled
than
we
could
remember
and
perhaps
every
sheaf
in
it
destined
to
be
burned
or
stolen
before
we
had
finished
the
bread
we
had
baked
among
all
these
troubles
there
was
however
or
seemed
to
be
one
comfort
tom
faggus
returned
from
london
very
proudly
and
very
happily
with
a
royal
pardon
in
black
and
white
which
everybody
admired
the
more
because
no
one
could
read
a
word
of
it
the
squire
himself
acknowledged
cheerfully
that
he
could
sooner
take
fifty
purses
than
read
a
single
line
of
it
some
people
indeed
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
parchment
was
made
from
a
sheep
tom
had
stolen
and
that
was
why
it
prevaricated
so
in
giving
him
a
character
but
i
knowing
something
by
this
time
of
lawyers
was
able
to
contradict
them
affirming
that
the
wolf
had
more
than
the
sheep
to
do
with
this
matter
for
according
to
our
old
saying
the
three
learned
professions
live
by
roguery
on
the
three
parts
of
a
man
the
doctor
mauls
our
bodies
the
parson
starves
our
souls
but
the
lawyer
must
be
the
adroitest
knave
for
he
has
to
ensnare
our
minds
therefore
he
takes
a
careful
delight
in
covering
his
traps
and
engines
with
a
spread
of
deadleaf
words
whereof
himself
knows
little
more
than
half
the
way
to
spell
them
but
now
tom
faggus
although
having
wit
to
gallop
away
on
his
strawberry
mare
with
the
speed
of
terror
from
lawyers
having
paid
them
with
money
too
honest
to
stop
yet
fell
into
a
reckless
adventure
ere
ever
he
came
home
from
which
any
lawyer
would
have
saved
him
although
he
ought
to
have
needed
none
beyond
common
thought
for
dear
annie
now
i
am
and
ever
have
been
so
vexed
about
this
story
that
i
cannot
tell
it
pleasantly
as
i
try
to
write
in
general
in
my
own
words
and
manner
therefore
i
will
let
john
fry
whom
i
have
robbed
of
another
story
to
which
he
was
more
entitled
and
whom
i
have
robbed
of
many
speeches
which
he
thought
very
excellent
lest
i
should
grieve
any
one
with
his
lack
of
educationthe
last
lack
he
ever
felt
by
the
bye
now
with
your
good
leave
i
will
allow
poor
john
to
tell
this
tale
in
his
own
words
and
style
which
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
having
been
the
first
to
tell
us
for
squire
faggus
kept
it
close
not
trusting
even
annie
with
it
or
at
least
she
said
so
because
no
man
knows
much
of
his
sweethearts
tongue
until
she
has
borne
him
a
child
or
two
only
before
john
begins
his
story
this
i
would
say
in
duty
to
him
and
in
common
honestythat
i
dare
not
write
down
some
few
of
his
words
because
they
are
not
convenient
for
dialect
or
other
causes
and
that
i
cannot
find
any
way
of
spelling
many
of
the
words
which
i
do
repeat
so
that
people
not
born
on
exmoor
may
know
how
he
pronounced
them
even
if
they
could
bring
their
lips
and
their
legs
to
the
proper
attitude
and
in
this
i
speak
advisedly
having
observed
some
thousand
times
that
the
manner
a
man
has
of
spreading
his
legs
and
bending
his
knees
or
stiffening
and
even
the
way
he
will
set
his
heel
make
all
the
difference
in
his
tone
and
time
of
casting
his
voice
aright
and
power
of
coming
home
to
you
we
always
liked
johns
stories
not
for
any
wit
in
them
but
because
we
laughed
at
the
man
rather
than
the
matter
the
way
he
held
his
head
was
enough
with
his
chin
fixed
hard
like
a
certainty
especially
during
his
biggest
lie
not
a
sign
of
a
smile
in
his
lips
or
nose
but
a
power
of
not
laughing
and
his
eyes
not
turning
to
anybody
unless
somebody
had
too
much
of
it
as
young
girls
always
do
and
went
over
the
brink
of
laughter
thereupon
it
was
good
to
see
john
fry
how
he
looked
gravely
first
at
the
laughter
as
much
as
to
ask
what
is
it
now
then
if
the
fool
went
laughing
more
as
he
or
she
was
sure
to
do
upon
that
dry
inquiry
john
would
look
again
to
be
sure
of
it
and
then
at
somebody
else
to
learn
whether
the
laugh
had
company
then
if
he
got
another
grin
all
his
mirth
came
out
in
glory
with
a
sudden
break
and
he
wiped
his
lips
and
was
grave
again
now
john
being
too
much
encouraged
by
the
girls
of
which
i
could
never
break
them
came
into
the
house
that
december
evening
with
every
inch
of
him
full
of
a
tale
annie
saw
it
and
lizzie
of
course
and
even
i
in
the
gloom
of
great
evils
perceived
that
john
was
a
loaded
gun
but
i
did
not
care
to
explode
him
now
nothing
primed
him
so
hotly
as
this
if
you
wanted
to
hear
all
john
fry
had
heard
the
surest
of
all
sure
ways
to
it
was
to
pretend
not
to
care
for
a
word
of
it
i
wor

discharge
them
and

with
fresh
powder
it
is
the
fog
of
the
morning
hath
spoiled
the
priming
that
rogue
is
not
in

yet
but
god
knows
we
must
not
be
asleep
with
him
or
what
will
his
majesty
say
to

if

slip
once
more
excellent
wondrous
well

one

dree
and
shutt
cries
squire
maunder
standing
up
in
the
irons
of
his
stirrups
thereupon
they
all
blazed
out
and
the
noise
of
it
went
all
round
the
hills
with
a
girt
thick
cloud
arising
and
all
the
air
smelling
of
powder
before
the
cloud
was
gone
so
much
as
ten
yards
on
the
wind
the
gentleman
on
the
cuebald
horse
shuts
up
his
face
like
a
pair
of
nutcracks
as
wide
as
it
was
long
before
and
out
he
pulls
two
girt
pistols
longside
of
zaddle
and
clapth
one
to
squire

and

the
wit
to
apprehend
tom
faggus
squire
maunder
swore
so
that
he
ought
to
be
fined
but
he
pulled
out
his
purse
none
the
slower
for
that
and
so
did
sir
richard
blewitt
first
man
i
see
go
to
load
a
gun
ill
gie
un
the
bullet
to
do
it
with
said
tom
for
you
see
it
was
him
and
no
other
looking
quietly
round
upon
all
of
them
then
he
robbed
all
the
rest
of
their
warships
as
pleasant
as
might
be
and
he
saith
now
gentlemen
do
your
duty
serve
your
warrants
afore
you
imprison
me
with
that
he
made
them
give
up
all
the
warrants
and
he
stuck
them
in
the
band
of
his
hat
and
then
he
made
a
bow
with
it
good
morning
to
your
warships
now
and
a
merry
christmas
all
of
you
and
the
merrier
both
for
rich
and
poor
when
gentlemen
see
their
almsgiving
lest
you
deny
yourselves
the
pleasure
i
will
aid
your
warships
and
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
following
me
when

in
the
name
of

i
thank
you
all
this
while
he
was
casting
their
money
among
the
poor
folk
by
the
handful
and
then
he
spak
kaindly
to
the
red
mare
and
wor
over

of

the
truth
of
this
story
is
well
established
by
firstrate
tradition
chapter
xl
two
fools
together
that
story
of
john
frys
instead
of
causing
any
amusement
gave
us
great
disquietude
not
only
because
it
showed
that
tom
faggus
could
not
resist
sudden
temptation
and
the
delight
of
wildness
but
also
that
we
greatly
feared
lest
the
kings
pardon
might
be
annulled
and
all
his
kindness
cancelled
by
a
reckless
deed
of
that
sort
it
was
true
as
annie
insisted
continually
even
with
tears
to
wear
in
her
arguments
that
tom
had
not
brought
away
anything
except
the
warrants
which
were
of
no
use
at
all
after
receipt
of
the
pardon
neither
had
he
used
any
violence
except
just
to
frighten
people
but
could
it
be
established
even
towards
christmastime
that
tom
had
a
right
to
give
alms
right
and
left
out
of
other
peoples
money
dear
annie
appeared
to
believe
that
it
could
saying
that
if
the
rich
continually
chose
to
forget
the
poor
a
man
who
forced
them
to
remember
and
so
to
do
good
to
themselves
and
to
others
was
a
public
benefactor
and
entitled
to
every
blessing
but
i
knew
and
so
lizzie
knewjohn
fry
being
now
out
of
hearingthat
this
was
not
sound
argument
for
if
it
came
to
that
any
man
might
take
the
king
by
the
throat
and
make
him
cast
away
among
the
poor
the
money
which
he
wanted
sadly
for
her
grace
the
duchess
and
the
beautiful
countess
of
this
and
of
that
lizzie
of
course
knew
nothing
about
his
majestys
diversions
which
were
not
fit
for
a
young
maids
thoughts
but
i
now
put
the
form
of
the
argument
as
it
occurred
to
me
therefore
i
said
once
for
all
and
both
my
sisters
always
listened
when
i
used
the
deep
voice
from
my
chest
tom
faggus
hath
done
wrong
herein
wrong
to
himself
and
to
our
annie
all
he
need
have
done
was
to
show
his
pardon
and
the
magistrates
would
have
rejoiced
with
him
he
might
have
led
a
most
godly
life
and
have
been
respected
by
everybody
and
knowing
how
brave
tom
is
i
thought
that
he
would
have
done
as
much
now
if
i
were
in
love
with
a
maidi
put
it
thus
for
the
sake
of
poor
lizzienever
would
i
so
imperil
my
life
and
her
fortune
in
life
along
with
me
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
diversion
a
mans
first
duty
is
to
the
women
who
are
forced
to
hang
upon
him
oh
john
not
that
horrible
word
cried
annie
to
my
great
surprise
and
serious
interruption
oh
john
any
word
but
that
and
she
burst
forth
crying
terribly
what
word
lizzie
what
does
the
wench
mean
i
asked
in
the
saddest
vexation
seeing
no
good
to
ask
annie
at
all
for
she
carried
on
most
dreadfully
dont
you
know
you
stupid
lout
said
lizzie
completing
my
wonderment
by
the
scorn
of
her
quicker
intelligence
if
you
dont
know
axe
about
and
with
that
i
was
forced
to
be
content
for
lizzie
took
annie
in
such
a
manner
on
purpose
to
vex
me
as
i
could
see
with
her
head
drooping
down
and
her
hair
coming
over
and
tears
and
sobs
rising
and
falling
to
boot
without
either
order
or
reason
that
seeing
no
good
for
a
man
to
do
since
neither
of
them
was
lorna
i
even
went
out
into
the
courtyard
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
wondered
what
on
earth
is
the
meaning
of
women
now
in
this
i
was
wrong
and
unreasonable
as
all
women
will
acknowledge
but
sometimes
a
man
is
so
put
out
by
the
way
they
take
on
about
nothing
that
he
really
cannot
help
thinking
for
at
least
a
minute
that
women
are
a
mistake
for
ever
and
hence
are
for
ever
mistaken
nevertheless
i
could
not
see
that
any
of
these
great
thoughts
and
ideas
applied
at
all
to
my
lorna
but
that
she
was
a
different
being
not
woman
enough
to
do
anything
bad
yet
enough
of
a
woman
for
man
to
adore
and
now
a
thing
came
to
pass
which
tested
my
adoration
pretty
sharply
inasmuch
as
i
would
far
liefer
faced
carver
doone
and
his
father
nay
even
the
roaring
lion
himself
with
his
hoofs
and
flaming
nostrils
than
have
met
in
cold
blood
sir
ensor
doone
the
founder
of
all
the
colony
and
the
fear
of
the
very
fiercest
but
that
i
was
forced
to
do
at
this
time
and
in
the
manner
following
when
i
went
up
one
morning
to
look
for
my
seven
rooks
nests
behold
there
were
but
six
to
be
seen
for
the
topmost
of
them
all
was
gone
and
the
most
conspicuous
i
looked
and
looked
and
rubbed
my
eyes
and
turned
to
try
them
by
other
sights
and
then
i
looked
again
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
signal
was
made
for
me
to
come
because
my
love
was
in
danger
for
me
to
enter
the
valley
now
during
the
broad
daylight
could
have
brought
no
comfort
but
only
harm
to
the
maiden
and
certain
death
to
myself
yet
it
was
more
than
i
could
do
to
keep
altogether
at
distance
therefore
i
ran
to
the
nearest
place
where
i
could
remain
unseen
and
watched
the
glen
from
the
wooded
height
for
hours
and
hours
impatiently
however
no
impatience
of
mine
made
any
difference
in
the
scene
upon
which
i
was
gazing
in
the
part
of
the
valley
which
i
could
see
there
was
nothing
moving
except
the
water
and
a
few
stolen
cows
going
sadly
along
as
if
knowing
that
they
had
no
honest
right
there
it
sank
very
heavily
into
my
heart
with
all
the
beds
of
dead
leaves
around
it
and
there
was
nothing
i
cared
to
do
except
blow
on
my
fingers
and
long
for
more
wit
for
a
frost
was
beginning
which
made
a
great
difference
to
lorna
and
to
myself
i
trow
as
well
as
to
all
the
five
million
people
who
dwell
in
this
island
of
england
such
a
frost
as
never
i
saw
before
neither
hope
ever
to
see
again
a
time
when
it
was
impossible
to
milk
a
cow
for
icicles
or
for
a
man
to
shave
some
of
his
beard
as
i
liked
to
do
for
lornas
sake
because
she
was
so
smooth
without
blunting
his
razor
on
hard
gray
ice
no
man
could
keep
yatt
as
we
say
even
though
he
abandoned
his
work
altogether
and
thumped
himself
all
on
the
chest
and
the
front
till
his
frozen
hands
would
have
been
bleeding
except
for
the
cold
that
kept
still
all
his
veins

if
john
ridd
lived
until
the
year
1740
as
so
strong
a
man
was
bound
to
do
he
must
have
seen
almost
a
harder
frost
and
perhaps
it
put
an
end
to
him
for
then
he
would
be
some
fourscore
years
old
but
tradition
makes
him
keep
yatt
as
he
says
up
to
fivescore
yearsed
however
at
present
there
was
no
frost
although
for
a
fortnight
threatening
and
i
was
too
young
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
way
the
dead
leaves
hung
and
the
wormcasts
prickling
like
womens
combs
and
the
leaden
tone
upon
everything
and
the
dead
weight
of
the
sky
will
watcombe
the
old
man
at
lynmouth
who
had
been
half
over
the
world
almost
and
who
talked
so
much
of
the
gulfstream
had
as
i
afterwards
called
to
mind
foretold
a
very
bitter
winter
this
year
but
no
one
would
listen
to
him
because
there
were
not
so
many
hips
and
haws
as
usual
whereas
we
have
all
learned
from
our
grandfathers
that
providence
never
sends
very
hard
winters
without
having
furnished
a
large
supply
of
berries
for
the
birds
to
feed
upon
it
was
lucky
for
me
while
i
waited
here
that
our
very
best
sheepdog
old
watch
had
chosen
to
accompany
me
that
day
for
otherwise
i
must
have
had
no
dinner
being
unpersuaded
even
by
that
to
quit
my
survey
of
the
valley
however
by
aid
of
poor
watch
i
contrived
to
obtain
a
supply
of
food
for
i
sent
him
home
with
a
note
to
annie
fastened
upon
his
chest
and
in
less
than
an
hour
back
he
came
proud
enough
to
wag
his
tail
off
with
his
tongue
hanging
out
from
the
speed
of
his
journey
and
a
large
lump
of
bread
and
of
bacon
fastened
in
a
napkin
around
his
neck
i
had
not
told
my
sister
of
course
what
was
toward
for
why
should
i
make
her
anxious
when
it
grew
towards
dark
i
was
just
beginning
to
prepare
for
my
circuit
around
the
hills
but
suddenly
watch
gave
a
long
low
growl
i
kept
myself
close
as
possible
and
ordered
the
dog
to
be
silent
and
presently
saw
a
short
figure
approaching
from
a
thicklywooded
hollow
on
the
left
side
of
my
hidingplace
it
was
the
same
figure
i
had
seen
once
before
in
the
moonlight
at
plovers
barrows
and
proved
to
my
great
delight
to
be
the
little
maid
gwenny
carfax
she
started
a
moment
at
seeing
me
but
more
with
surprise
than
fear
and
then
she
laid
both
her
hands
upon
mine
as
if
she
had
known
me
for
twenty
years
young
man
she
said
you
must
come
with
me
i
was
gwain
all
the
way
to
fetch
thee
old
man
be
dying
and
her
cant
die
or
at
least
her
wont
without
first
considering
thee
considering
me
i
cried
what
can
sir
ensor
doone
want
with
considering
me
has
mistress
lorna
told
him
all
concerning
thee
and
thy
doings
when
she
knowed
old
man
were
so
near
his
end
that
vexed
he
was
about
thy
low
blood
a
thought
her
would
come
to
life
again
on
purpose
for
to
bate
ee
but
after
all
there
cant
be
scarcely
such
bad
luck
as
that
now
if
her
strook
thee
thou
must
take
it
there
be
no
denaying
of
un
fire
i
have
seen
afore
hot
and
red
and
raging
but
i
never
seen
cold
fire
afore
and
it
maketh
me
burn
and
shiver
and
in
truth
it
made
me
both
burn
and
shiver
to
know
that
i
must
either
go
straight
to
the
presence
of
sir
ensor
doone
or
give
up
lorna
once
for
all
and
rightly
be
despised
by
her
for
the
first
time
of
my
life
i
thought
that
she
had
not
acted
fairly
why
not
leave
the
old
man
in
peace
without
vexing
him
about
my
affair
but
presently
i
saw
again
that
in
this
matter
she
was
right
that
she
could
not
receive
the
old
mans
blessing
supposing
that
he
had
one
to
give
which
even
a
worse
man
might
suppose
while
she
deceived
him
about
herself
and
the
life
she
had
undertaken
therefore
with
great
misgiving
of
myself
but
no
ill
thought
of
my
darling
i
sent
watch
home
and
followed
gwenny
who
led
me
along
very
rapidly
with
her
short
broad
form
gliding
down
the
hollow
from
which
she
had
first
appeared
here
at
the
bottom
she
entered
a
thicket
of
gray
ash
stubs
and
black
holly
with
rocks
around
it
gnarled
with
roots
and
hung
with
masks
of
ivy
here
in
a
dark
and
lonely
corner
with
a
pixie
ring
before
it
she
came
to
a
narrow
door
very
brown
and
solid
looking
like
a
trunk
of
wood
at
a
little
distance
this
she
opened
without
a
key
by
stooping
down
and
pressing
it
where
the
threshold
met
the
jamb
and
then
she
ran
in
very
nimbly
but
i
was
forced
to
be
bent
in
two
and
even
so
without
comfort
the
passage
was
close
and
difficult
and
as
dark
as
any
black
pitch
but
it
was
not
long
be
it
as
it
might
and
in
that
there
was
some
comfort
we
came
out
soon
at
the
other
end
and
were
at
the
top
of
doone
valley
in
the
chilly
dusk
air
it
looked
most
untempting
especially
during
that
state
of
mind
under
which
i
was
labouring
as
we
crossed
towards
the
captains
house
we
met
a
couple
of
great
doones
lounging
by
the
waterside
gwenny
said
something
to
them
and
although
they
stared
very
hard
at
me
they
let
me
pass
without
hindrance
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
when
the
little
maid
opened
sir
ensors
door
my
heart
thumped
quite
as
much
with
terror
as
with
hope
of
lornas
presence
but
in
a
moment
the
fear
was
gone
for
lorna
was
trembling
in
my
arms
and
my
courage
rose
to
comfort
her
the
darling
feared
beyond
all
things
else
lest
i
should
be
offended
with
her
for
what
she
had
said
to
her
grandfather
and
for
dragging
me
into
his
presence
but
i
told
her
almost
a
falsehood
the
first
and
the
last
that
ever
i
did
tell
her
to
wit
that
i
cared
not
that
muchand
showed
her
the
tip
of
my
thumb
as
i
said
itfor
old
sir
ensor
and
all
his
wrath
so
long
as
i
had
his
granddaughters
love
now
i
tried
to
think
this
as
i
said
it
so
as
to
save
it
from
being
a
lie
but
somehow
or
other
it
did
not
answer
and
i
was
vexed
with
myself
both
ways
but
lorna
took
me
by
the
hand
as
bravely
as
she
could
and
led
me
into
a
little
passage
where
i
could
hear
the
river
moaning
and
the
branches
rustling
here
i
passed
as
long
a
minute
as
fear
ever
cheated
time
of
saying
to
myself
continually
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
frightened
at
yet
growing
more
and
more
afraid
by
reason
of
so
reasoning
at
last
my
lorna
came
back
very
pale
as
i
saw
by
the
candle
she
carried
and
whispered
now
be
patient
dearest
never
mind
what
he
says
to
you
neither
attempt
to
answer
him
look
at
him
gently
and
steadfastly
and
if
you
can
with
some
show
of
reverence
but
above
all
things
no
compassion
it
drives
him
almost
mad
now
come
walk
very
quietly
she
led
me
into
a
cold
dark
room
rough
and
very
gloomy
although
with
two
candles
burning
i
took
little
heed
of
the
things
in
it
though
i
marked
that
the
window
was
open
that
which
i
heeded
was
an
old
man
very
stern
and
comely
with
death
upon
his
countenance
yet
not
lying
in
his
bed
but
set
upright
in
a
chair
with
a
loose
red
cloak
thrown
over
him
upon
this
his
white
hair
fell
and
his
pallid
fingers
lay
in
a
ghastly
fashion
without
a
sign
of
life
or
movement
or
of
the
power
that
kept
him
up
all
rigid
calm
and
relentless
only
in
his
great
black
eyes
fixed
upon
me
solemnly
all
the
power
of
his
body
dwelt
all
the
life
of
his
soul
was
burning
i
could
not
look
at
him
very
nicely
being
afeared
of
the
death
in
his
face
and
most
afeared
to
show
it
and
to
tell
the
truth
my
poor
blue
eyes
fell
away
from
the
blackness
of
his
as
if
it
had
been
my
coffinplate
therefore
i
made
a
low
obeisance
and
tried
not
to
shiver
only
i
groaned
that
lorna
thought
it
good
manners
to
leave
us
two
together
ah
said
the
old
man
and
his
voice
seemed
to
come
from
a
cavern
of
skeletons
are
you
that
great
john
ridd
john
ridd
is
my
name
your
honour
was
all
that
i
could
answer
and
i
hope
your
worship
is
better
child
have
you
sense
enough
to
know
what
you
have
been
doing
yes
i
knew
right
well
i
answered
that
i
have
set
mine
eyes
far
above
my
rank
are
you
ignorant
that
lorna
doone
is
born
of
the
oldest
families
remaining
in
north
europe
i
was
ignorant
of
that
your
worship
yet
i
knew
of
her
high
descent
from
the
doones
of
bagworthy
the
old
mans
eyes
like
fire
probed
me
whether
i
was
jesting
then
perceiving
how
grave
i
was
and
thinking
that
i
could
not
laugh
as
many
people
suppose
of
me
he
took
on
himself
to
make
good
the
deficiency
with
a
very
bitter
smile
and
know
you
of
your
own
low
descent
from
the
ridds
of
oare
sir
i
answered
being
as
yet
unaccustomed
to
this
style
of
speech
the
ridds
of
oare
have
been
honest
men
twice
as
long
as
the
doones
have
been
rogues
i
would
not
answer
for
that
john
sir
ensor
replied
very
quietly
when
i
expected
fury
if
it
be
so
thy
family
is
the
very
oldest
in
europe
now
hearken
to
me
boy
or
clown
or
honest
fool
or
whatever
thou
art
hearken
to
an
old
mans
words
who
has
not
many
hours
to
live
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
to
fear
nothing
to
revere
or
trust
nothing
even
to
hope
for
least
of
all
is
there
aught
to
love
i
hope
your
worship
is
not
quite
right
i
answered
with
great
misgivings
else
it
is
a
sad
mistake
for
anybody
to
live
sir
therefore
he
continued
as
if
i
had
never
spoken
though
it
may
seem
hard
for
a
week
or
two
like
the
loss
of
any
other
toy
i
deprive
you
of
nothing
but
add
to
your
comfort
and
if
there
be
such
a
thing
to
your
happiness
when
i
forbid
you
ever
to
see
that
foolish
child
again
all
marriage
is
a
wretched
farce
even
when
man
and
wife
belong
to
the
same
rank
of
life
have
temper
well
assorted
similar
likes
and
dislikes
and
about
the
same
pittance
of
mind
but
when
they
are
not
so
matched
the
farce
would
become
a
long
dull
tragedy
if
anything
were
worth
lamenting
there
i
have
reasoned
enough
with
you
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
reasoning
though
i
have
little
confidence
in
mans
honour
i
have
some
reliance
in
womans
pride
you
will
pledge
your
word
in
lornas
presence
never
to
see
or
to
seek
her
again
never
even
to
think
of
her
more
now
call
her
for
i
am
weary
he
kept
his
great
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
their
icy
fire
as
if
he
scorned
both
life
and
death
and
on
his
haughty
lips
some
slight
amusement
at
my
trouble
and
then
he
raised
one
hand
as
if
i
were
a
poor
dumb
creature
and
pointed
to
the
door
although
my
heart
rebelled
and
kindled
at
his
proud
disdain
i
could
not
disobey
him
freely
but
made
a
low
salute
and
went
straightway
in
search
of
lorna
i
found
my
love
or
not
my
love
according
as
now
she
should
behave
for
i
was
very
desperate
being
put
upon
so
sadly
lorna
doone
was
crying
softly
at
a
little
window
and
listening
to
the
rivers
grief
i
laid
my
heavy
arm
around
her
not
with
any
air
of
claiming
or
of
forcing
her
thoughts
to
me
but
only
just
to
comfort
her
and
ask
what
she
was
thinking
of
to
my
arm
she
made
no
answer
neither
to
my
seeking
eyes
but
to
my
heart
once
for
all
she
spoke
with
her
own
upon
it
not
a
word
nor
sound
between
us
not
even
a
kiss
was
interchanged
but
man
or
maid
who
has
ever
loved
hath
learned
our
understanding
therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
we
saw
fit
to
enter
sir
ensors
room
in
the
following
manner
lorna
with
her
right
hand
swallowed
entirely
by
the
palm
of
mine
and
her
waist
retired
from
view
by
means
of
my
left
arm
all
one
side
of
her
hair
came
down
in
a
way
to
be
remembered
upon
the
left
and
fairest
part
of
my
favourite
otterskin
waistcoat
and
her
head
as
well
would
have
lain
there
doubtless
but
for
the
danger
of
walking
so
i
for
my
part
was
too
far
gone
to
lag
behind
in
the
matter
but
carried
my
love
bravely
fearing
neither
death
nor
hell
while
she
abode
beside
me
old
sir
ensor
looked
much
astonished
for
forty
years
he
had
been
obeyed
and
feared
by
all
around
him
and
he
knew
that
i
had
feared
him
vastly
before
i
got
hold
of
lorna
and
indeed
i
was
still
afraid
of
him
only
for
loving
lorna
so
and
having
to
protect
her
then
i
made
him
a
bow
to
the
very
best
of
all
i
had
learned
both
at
tiverton
and
in
london
after
that
i
waited
for
him
to
begin
as
became
his
age
and
rank
in
life
ye
two
fools
he
said
at
last
with
a
depth
of
contempt
which
no
words
may
express
ye
two
fools
may
it
please
your
worship
i
answered
softly
maybe
we
are
not
such
fools
as
we
look
but
though
we
be
we
are
well
content
so
long
as
we
may
be
two
fools
together
why
john
said
the
old
man
with
a
spark
as
of
smiling
in
his
eyes
thou
art
not
altogether
the
clumsy
yokel
and
the
clod
i
took
thee
for
oh
no
grandfather
oh
dear
grandfather
cried
lorna
with
such
zeal
and
flashing
that
her
hands
went
forward
nobody
knows
what
john
ridd
is
because
he
is
so
modest
i
mean
nobody
except
me
dear
and
here
she
turned
to
me
again
and
rose
upon
tiptoe
and
kissed
me
i
have
seen
a
little
o
the
world
said
the
old
man
while
i
was
half
ashamed
although
so
proud
of
lorna
but
this
is
beyond
all
i
have
seen
and
nearly
all
i
have
heard
of
it
is
more
fit
for
southern
climates
than
for
the
fogs
of
exmoor
it
is
fit
for
all
the
world
your
worship
with
your
honours
good
leave
and
will
i
answered
in
humility
being
still
ashamed
of
it
when
it
happens
so
to
people
there
is
nothing
that
can
stop
it
sir
now
sir
ensor
doone
was
leaning
back
upon
his
brown
chairrail
which
was
built
like
a
triangle
as
in
old
farmhouses
from
one
of
which
it
had
come
no
doubt
free
from
expense
or
gratitude
and
as
i
spoke
he
coughed
a
little
and
he
sighed
a
good
deal
more
and
perhaps
his
dying
heart
desired
to
open
time
again
with
such
a
lift
of
warmth
and
hope
as
he
descried
in
our
eyes
and
arms
i
could
not
understand
him
then
any
more
than
a
baby
playing
with
his
grandfathers
spectacles
nevertheless
i
wondered
whether
at
his
time
of
life
or
rather
on
the
brink
of
death
he
was
thinking
of
his
youth
and
pride
fools
you
are
be
fools
for
ever
said
sir
ensor
doone
at
last
while
we
feared
to
break
his
thoughts
but
let
each
other
know
our
own
with
little
ways
of
pressure
it
is
the
best
thing
i
can
wish
you
boy
and
girl
be
boy
and
girl
until
you
have
grandchildren
partly
in
bitterness
he
spoke
and
partly
in
pure
weariness
and
then
he
turned
so
as
not
to
see
us
and
his
white
hair
fell
like
a
shroud
around
him
chapter
xli
cold
comfort
all
things
being
full
of
flaw
all
things
being
full
of
holes
the
strength
of
all
things
is
in
shortness
if
sir
ensor
doone
had
dwelled
for
half
an
hour
upon
himself
and
an
hour
perhaps
upon
lorna
and
me
we
must
both
have
wearied
of
him
and
required
change
of
air
but
now
i
longed
to
see
and
know
a
great
deal
more
about
him
and
hoped
that
he
might
not
go
to
heaven
for
at
least
a
week
or
more
however
he
was
too
good
for
this
world
as
we
say
of
all
people
who
leave
it
and
i
verily
believe
his
heart
was
not
a
bad
one
after
all
evil
he
had
done
no
doubt
as
evil
had
been
done
to
him
yet
how
many
have
done
evil
while
receiving
only
good
be
that
as
it
may
and
not
vexing
a
question
settled
for
ever
without
our
votes
let
us
own
that
he
was
at
least
a
brave
and
courteous
gentleman
and
his
loss
aroused
great
lamentation
not
among
the
doones
alone
and
the
women
they
had
carried
off
but
also
of
the
general
public
and
many
even
of
the
magistrates
for
several
miles
round
exmoor
and
this
not
only
from
fear
lest
one
more
wicked
might
succeed
him
as
appeared
indeed
too
probable
but
from
true
admiration
of
his
strong
will
and
sympathy
with
his
misfortunes
i
will
not
deceive
any
one
by
saying
that
sir
ensor
doone
gave
in
so
many
words
his
consent
to
my
resolve
about
lorna
this
he
never
did
except
by
his
speech
last
written
down
from
which
as
he
mentioned
grandchildren
a
lawyer
perhaps
might
have
argued
it
not
but
what
he
may
have
meant
to
bestow
on
us
his
blessing
only
that
he
died
next
day
without
taking
the
trouble
to
do
it
he
called
indeed
for
his
box
of
snuff
which
was
a
very
high
thing
to
take
and
which
he
never
took
without
being
in
very
good
humour
at
least
for
him
and
though
it
would
not
go
up
his
nostrils
through
the
failure
of
his
breath
he
was
pleased
to
have
it
there
and
not
to
think
of
dying
will
your
honour
have
it
wiped
i
asked
him
very
softly
for
the
brown
appearance
of
it
spoiled
to
my
idea
his
white
mostacchio
but
he
seemed
to
shake
his
head
and
i
thought
it
kept
his
spirits
up
i
had
never
before
seen
any
one
do
what
all
of
us
have
to
do
some
day
and
it
greatly
kept
my
spirits
down
although
it
did
not
so
very
much
frighten
me
for
it
takes
a
man
but
a
little
while
his
instinct
being
of
death
perhaps
at
least
as
much
as
of
life
which
accounts
for
his
slaying
his
fellow
men
so
and
every
other
creature
it
does
not
take
a
man
very
long
to
enter
into
another
mans
death
and
bring
his
own
mood
to
suit
it
he
knows
that
his
own
is
sure
to
come
and
nature
is
fond
of
the
practice
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
i
after
easing
my
mothers
fears
and
seeing
a
little
to
business
returned
as
if
drawn
by
a
polar
needle
to
the
deathbed
of
sir
ensor
there
was
some
little
confusion
people
wanting
to
get
away
and
people
trying
to
come
in
from
downright
curiosity
of
all
things
the
most
hateful
and
others
making
great
todo
and
talking
of
their
own
time
to
come
telling
their
own
age
and
so
on
but
every
one
seemed
to
think
or
feel
that
i
had
a
right
to
be
there
because
the
women
took
that
view
of
it
as
for
carver
and
counsellor
they
were
minding
their
own
affairs
so
as
to
win
the
succession
and
never
found
it
in
their
business
at
least
so
long
as
i
was
there
to
come
near
the
dying
man
he
for
his
part
never
asked
for
any
one
to
come
near
him
not
even
a
priest
nor
a
monk
or
friar
but
seemed
to
be
going
his
own
way
peaceful
and
well
contented
only
the
chief
of
the
women
said
that
from
his
face
she
believed
and
knew
that
he
liked
to
have
me
at
one
side
of
his
bed
and
lorna
upon
the
other
an
hour
or
two
ere
the
old
man
died
when
only
we
two
were
with
him
he
looked
at
us
both
very
dimly
and
softly
as
if
he
wished
to
do
something
for
us
but
had
left
it
now
too
late
lorna
hoped
that
he
wanted
to
bless
us
but
he
only
frowned
at
that
and
let
his
hand
drop
downward
and
crooked
one
knotted
finger
he
wants
something
out
of
the
bed
dear
lorna
whispered
to
me
see
what
it
is
upon
your
side
there
i
followed
the
bent
of
his
poor
shrunken
hand
and
sought
among
the
pilings
and
there
i
felt
something
hard
and
sharp
and
drew
it
forth
and
gave
it
to
him
it
flashed
like
the
spray
of
a
fountain
upon
us
in
the
dark
winter
of
the
room
he
could
not
take
it
in
his
hand
but
let
it
hang
as
daisies
do
only
making
lorna
see
that
he
meant
her
to
have
it
why
it
is
my
glass
necklace
lorna
cried
in
great
surprise
my
necklace
he
always
promised
me
and
from
which
you
have
got
the
ring
john
but
grandfather
kept
it
because
the
children
wanted
to
pull
it
from
my
neck
may
i
have
it
now
dear
grandfather
not
unless
you
wish
dear
darling
lorna
wept
again
because
the
old
man
could
not
tell
her
except
by
one
very
feeble
nod
that
she
was
doing
what
he
wished
then
she
gave
to
me
the
trinket
for
the
sake
of
safety
and
i
stowed
it
in
my
breast
he
seemed
to
me
to
follow
this
and
to
be
well
content
with
it
before
sir
ensor
doone
was
buried
the
greatest
frost
of
the
century
had
set
in
with
its
iron
hand
and
step
of
stone
on
everything
how
it
came
is
not
my
business
nor
can
i
explain
it
because
i
never
have
watched
the
skies
as
people
now
begin
to
do
when
the
ground
is
not
to
their
liking
though
of
all
this
i
know
nothing
and
less
than
nothing
i
may
say
because
i
ought
to
know
something
i
can
hear
what
people
tell
me
and
i
can
see
before
my
eyes
the
strong
men
broke
three
good
pickaxes
ere
they
got
through
the
hard
brown
sod
streaked
with
little
maps
of
gray
where
old
sir
ensor
was
to
lie
upon
his
back
awaiting
the
darkness
of
the
judgmentday
it
was
in
the
little
chapelyard
i
will
not
tell
the
name
of
it
because
we
are
now
such
protestants
that
i
might
do
it
an
evil
turn
only
it
was
the
little
place
where
lornas
aunt
sabina
lay
here
was
i
remaining
long
with
a
little
curiosity
because
some
people
told
me
plainly
that
i
must
be
damned
for
ever
by
a
papist
funeral
and
here
came
lorna
scarcely
breathing
through
the
thick
of
stuff
around
her
yet
with
all
her
little
breath
steaming
on
the
air
like
frost
i
stood
apart
from
the
ceremony
in
which
of
course
i
was
not
entitled
either
by
birth
or
religion
to
bear
any
portion
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
wiser
in
me
to
have
kept
away
altogether
for
now
there
was
no
one
to
protect
me
among
those
wild
and
lawless
men
and
both
carver
and
the
counsellor
had
vowed
a
fearful
vengeance
on
me
as
i
heard
from
gwenny
they
had
not
dared
to
meddle
with
me
while
the
chief
lay
dying
nor
was
it
in
their
policy
for
a
short
time
after
that
to
endanger
their
succession
by
an
open
breach
with
lorna
whose
tender
age
and
beauty
held
so
many
of
the
youths
in
thrall
the
ancient
outlaws
funeral
was
a
grand
and
moving
sight
more
perhaps
from
the
sense
of
contrast
than
from
that
of
fitness
to
see
those
dark
and
mighty
men
inured
to
all
of
sin
and
crime
reckless
both
of
man
and
god
yet
now
with
heads
devoutly
bent
clasped
hands
and
downcast
eyes
following
the
long
black
coffin
of
their
common
ancestor
to
the
place
where
they
must
join
him
when
their
sum
of
ill
was
done
and
to
see
the
feeble
priest
chanting
over
the
dead
form
words
the
living
would
have
laughed
at
sprinkling
with
his
little
broom
drops
that
could
not
purify
while
the
children
robed
in
white
swung
their
smoking
censers
slowly
over
the
cold
and
twilight
grave
and
after
seeing
all
to
ask
with
a
shudder
unexpressed
is
this
the
end
that
god
intended
for
a
man
so
proud
and
strong
not
a
tear
was
shed
upon
him
except
from
the
sweetest
of
all
sweet
eyes
not
a
sigh
pursued
him
home
except
in
hot
anger
his
life
had
been
cold
and
bitter
and
distant
and
now
a
week
had
exhausted
all
the
sorrow
of
those
around
him
a
grief
flowing
less
from
affection
than
fear
aged
men
will
show
his
tombstone
mothers
haste
with
their
infants
by
it
children
shrink
from
the
name
upon
it
until
in
time
his
history
shall
lapse
and
be
forgotten
by
all
except
the
great
judge
and
god
after
all
was
over
i
strode
across
the
moors
very
sadly
trying
to
keep
the
cold
away
by
virtue
of
quick
movement
not
a
flake
of
snow
had
fallen
yet
all
the
earth
was
caked
and
hard
with
a
dry
brown
crust
upon
it
all
the
sky
was
banked
with
darkness
hard
austere
and
frowning
the
fog
of
the
last
three
weeks
was
gone
neither
did
any
rime
remain
but
all
things
had
a
look
of
sameness
and
a
kind
of
furzy
colour
it
was
freezing
hard
and
sharp
with
a
piercing
wind
to
back
it
and
i
had
observed
that
the
holy
water
froze
upon
sir
ensors
coffin
one
thing
struck
me
with
some
surprise
as
i
made
off
for
our
fireside
with
a
strong
determination
to
heave
an
ashtree
up
the
chimneyplace
and
that
was
how
the
birds
were
going
rather
than
flying
as
they
used
to
fly
all
the
birds
were
set
in
one
direction
steadily
journeying
westward
not
with
any
heat
of
speed
neither
flying
far
at
once
but
all
as
if
on
business
bound
partly
running
partly
flying
partly
fluttering
along
silently
and
without
a
voice
neither
pricking
head
nor
tail
this
movement
of
the
birds
went
on
even
for
a
week
or
more
every
kind
of
thrushes
passed
us
every
kind
of
wild
fowl
even
plovers
went
away
and
crows
and
snipes
and
woodcocks
and
before
half
the
frost
was
over
all
we
had
in
the
snowy
ditches
were
hares
so
tame
that
we
could
pat
them
partridges
that
came
to
hand
with
a
dry
noise
in
their
crops
heathpoults
making
cups
of
snow
and
a
few
poor
hopping
redwings
flipping
in
and
out
the
hedge
having
lost
the
power
to
fly
and
all
the
time
their
great
black
eyes
set
with
gold
around
them
seemed
to
look
at
any
man
for
mercy
and
for
comfort
annie
took
a
many
of
them
all
that
she
could
find
herself
and
all
the
boys
would
bring
her
and
she
made
a
great
hutch
near
the
fire
in
the
backkitchen
chimneyplace
here
in
spite
of
our
old
betty
who
sadly
wanted
to
roast
them
annie
kept
some
fifty
birds
with
bread
and
milk
and
raw
chopped
meat
and
all
the
seed
she
could
think
of
and
lumps
of
rotten
apples
placed
to
tempt
them
in
the
corners
some
got
on
and
some
died
off
and
annie
cried
for
all
that
died
and
buried
them
under
the
woodrick
but
i
do
assure
you
it
was
a
pretty
thing
to
see
when
she
went
to
them
in
the
morning
there
was
not
a
bird
but
knew
her
well
after
one
day
of
comforting
and
some
would
come
to
her
hand
and
sit
and
shut
one
eye
and
look
at
her
then
she
used
to
stroke
their
heads
and
feel
their
breasts
and
talk
to
them
and
not
a
bird
of
them
all
was
there
but
liked
to
have
it
done
to
him
and
i
do
believe
they
would
eat
from
her
hand
things
unnatural
to
them
lest
she
should
he
grieved
and
hurt
by
not
knowing
what
to
do
for
them
one
of
them
was
a
noble
bird
such
as
i
never
had
seen
before
of
very
fine
bright
plumage
and
larger
than
a
misselthrush
he
was
the
hardest
of
all
to
please
and
yet
he
tried
to
do
his
best
i
have
heard
since
then
from
a
man
who
knows
all
about
birds
and
beasts
and
fishes
that
he
must
have
been
a
norwegian
bird
called
in
this
country
a
roller
who
never
comes
to
england
but
in
the
most
tremendous
winters
another
little
bird
there
was
whom
i
longed
to
welcome
home
and
protect
from
enemies
a
little
bird
no
native
to
us
but
than
any
native
dearer
but
lo
in
the
very
night
which
followed
old
sir
ensors
funeral
such
a
storm
of
snow
began
as
never
have
i
heard
nor
read
of
neither
could
have
dreamed
it
at
what
time
of
night
it
first
began
is
more
than
i
can
say
at
least
from
my
own
knowledge
for
we
all
went
to
bed
soon
after
supper
being
cold
and
not
inclined
to
talk
at
that
time
the
wind
was
moaning
sadly
and
the
sky
as
dark
as
a
wood
and
the
straw
in
the
yard
swirling
round
and
round
and
the
cows
huddling
into
the
great
cowhouse
with
their
chins
upon
one
another
but
we
being
blinder
than
they
i
suppose
and
not
having
had
a
great
snow
for
years
made
no
preparation
against
the
storm
except
that
the
lambing
ewes
were
in
shelter
it
struck
me
as
i
lay
in
bed
that
we
were
acting
foolishly
for
an
ancient
shepherd
had
dropped
in
and
taken
supper
with
us
and
foretold
a
heavy
fall
and
great
disaster
to
live
stock
he
said
that
he
had
known
a
frost
beginning
just
as
this
had
done
with
a
black
east
wind
after
days
of
raw
cold
fog
and
then
on
the
third
night
of
the
frost
at
this
very
time
of
year
to
wit
on
the
15th
of
december
such
a
snow
set
in
as
killed
half
of
the
sheep
and
many
even
of
the
red
deer
and
the
forest
ponies
it
was
threescore
years
agone
he
said
and
cause
he
had
to
remember
it
inasmuch
as
two
of
his
toes
had
been
lost
by
frostnip
while
he
dug
out
his
sheep
on
the
other
side
of
the
dunkery
hereupon
mother
nodded
at
him
having
heard
from
her
father
about
it
and
how
three
men
had
been
frozen
to
death
and
how
badly
their
stockings
came
off
from
them

the
frost
of
1625
remembering
how
the
old
man
looked
and
his
manner
of
listening
to
the
wind
and
shaking
his
head
very
ominously
when
annie
gave
him
a
glass
of
schnapps
i
grew
quite
uneasy
in
my
bed
as
the
room
got
colder
and
colder
and
i
made
up
my
mind
if
it
only
pleased
god
not
to
send
the
snow
till
the
morning
that
every
sheep
and
horse
and
cow
ay
and
even
the
poultry
should
be
brought
in
snug
and
with
plenty
to
eat
and
fodder
enough
to
roast
them
alas
what
use
of
mans
resolves
when
they
come
a
day
too
late
even
if
they
may
avail
a
little
when
they
are
most
punctual
in
the
bitter
morning
i
arose
to
follow
out
my
purpose
knowing
the
time
from
the
force
of
habit
although
the
room
was
so
dark
and
gray
an
odd
white
light
was
on
the
rafters
such
as
i
never
had
seen
before
while
all
the
length
of
the
room
was
grisly
like
the
heart
of
a
mouldy
oatrick
i
went
to
the
window
at
once
of
course
and
at
first
i
could
not
understand
what
was
doing
outside
of
it
it
faced
due
east
as
i
may
have
said
with
the
walnuttree
partly
sheltering
it
and
generally
i
could
see
the
yard
and
the
woodrick
and
even
the
church
beyond
but
now
half
the
lattice
was
quite
blocked
up
as
if
plastered
with
gray
lime
and
little
fringes
like
ferns
came
through
where
the
joining
of
the
lead
was
and
in
the
only
undarkened
part
countless
dots
came
swarming
clustering
beating
with
a
soft
low
sound
then
gliding
down
in
a
slippery
manner
not
as
drops
of
rain
do
but
each
distinct
from
his
neighbour
inside
the
iron
frame
which
fitted
not
to
say
too
comfortably
and
went
along
the
stonework
at
least
a
peck
of
snow
had
entered
following
its
own
bend
and
fancy
light
as
any
cobweb
with
some
trouble
and
great
care
lest
the
ancient
frame
should
yield
i
spread
the
lattice
open
and
saw
at
once
that
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
to
save
our
stock
all
the
earth
was
flat
with
snow
all
the
air
was
thick
with
snow
more
than
this
no
man
could
see
for
all
the
world
was
snowing
i
shut
the
window
and
dressed
in
haste
and
when
i
entered
the
kitchen
not
even
betty
the
earliest
of
all
early
birds
was
there
i
raked
the
ashes
together
a
little
just
to
see
a
spark
of
warmth
and
then
set
forth
to
find
john
fry
jem
slocombe
and
bill
dadds
but
this
was
easier
thought
than
done
for
when
i
opened
the
courtyard
door
i
was
taken
up
to
my
knees
at
once
and
the
power
of
the
drifting
cloud
prevented
sight
of
anything
however
i
found
my
way
to
the
woodrick
and
there
got
hold
of
a
fine
ashstake
cut
by
myself
not
long
ago
with
this
i
ploughed
along
pretty
well
and
thundered
so
hard
at
john
frys
door
that
he
thought
it
was
the
doones
at
least
and
cocked
his
blunderbuss
out
of
the
window
john
was
very
loth
to
come
down
when
he
saw
the
meaning
of
it
for
he
valued
his
life
more
than
anything
else
though
he
tried
to
make
out
that
his
wife
was
to
blame
but
i
settled
his
doubts
by
telling
him
that
i
would
have
him
on
my
shoulder
naked
unless
he
came
in
five
minutes
not
that
he
could
do
much
good
but
because
the
other
men
would
be
sure
to
skulk
if
he
set
them
the
example
with
spades
and
shovels
and
pitchforks
and
a
round
of
roping
we
four
set
forth
to
dig
out
the
sheep
and
the
poor
things
knew
that
it
was
high
time
chapter
xlii
the
great
winter
it
must
have
snowed
most
wonderfully
to
have
made
that
depth
of
covering
in
about
eight
hours
for
one
of
master
stickles
men
who
had
been
out
all
the
night
said
that
no
snow
began
to
fall
until
nearly
midnight
and
here
it
was
blocking
up
the
doors
stopping
the
ways
and
the
water
courses
and
making
it
very
much
worse
to
walk
than
in
a
sawpit
newly
used
however
we
trudged
along
in
a
line
i
first
and
the
other
men
after
me
trying
to
keep
my
track
but
finding
legs
and
strength
not
up
to
it
most
of
all
john
fry
was
groaning
certain
that
his
time
was
come
and
sending
messages
to
his
wife
and
blessings
to
his
children
for
all
this
time
it
was
snowing
harder
than
it
ever
had
snowed
before
so
far
as
a
man
might
guess
at
it
and
the
leaden
depth
of
the
sky
came
down
like
a
mine
turned
upside
down
on
us
not
that
the
flakes
were
so
very
large
for
i
have
seen
much
larger
flakes
in
a
shower
of
march
while
sowing
peas
but
that
there
was
no
room
between
them
neither
any
relaxing
nor
any
change
of
direction
watch
like
a
good
and
faithful
dog
followed
us
very
cheerfully
leaping
out
of
the
depth
which
took
him
over
his
back
and
ears
already
even
in
the
level
places
while
in
the
drifts
he
might
have
sunk
to
any
distance
out
of
sight
and
never
found
his
way
up
again
however
we
helped
him
now
and
then
especially
through
the
gaps
and
gateways
and
so
after
a
deal
of
floundering
some
laughter
and
a
little
swearing
we
came
all
safe
to
the
lower
meadow
where
most
of
our
flock
was
hurdled
but
behold
there
was
no
flock
at
all
none
i
mean
to
be
seen
anywhere
only
at
one
corner
of
the
field
by
the
eastern
end
where
the
snow
drove
in
a
great
white
billow
as
high
as
a
barn
and
as
broad
as
a
house
this
great
drift
was
rolling
and
curling
beneath
the
violent
blast
tufting
and
combing
with
rustling
swirls
and
carved
as
in
patterns
of
cornice
where
the
grooving
chisel
of
the
wind
swept
round
ever
and
again
the
tempest
snatched
little
whiffs
from
the
channelled
edges
twirled
them
round
and
made
them
dance
over
the
chime
of
the
monster
pile
then
let
them
lie
like
herringbones
or
the
seams
of
sand
where
the
tide
has
been
and
all
the
while
from
the
smothering
sky
more
and
more
fiercely
at
every
blast
came
the
pelting
pitiless
arrows
winged
with
murky
white
and
pointed
with
the
barbs
of
frost
but
although
for
people
who
had
no
sheep
the
sight
was
a
very
fine
one
so
far
at
least
as
the
weather
permitted
any
sight
at
all
yet
for
us
with
our
flock
beneath
it
this
great
mount
had
but
little
charm
watch
began
to
scratch
at
once
and
to
howl
along
the
sides
of
it
he
knew
that
his
charge
was
buried
there
and
his
business
taken
from
him
but
we
four
men
set
to
in
earnest
digging
with
all
our
might
and
main
shovelling
away
at
the
great
white
pile
and
fetching
it
into
the
meadow
each
man
made
for
himself
a
cave
scooping
at
the
soft
cold
flux
which
slid
upon
him
at
every
stroke
and
throwing
it
out
behind
him
in
piles
of
castled
fancy
at
last
we
drove
our
tunnels
in
for
we
worked
indeed
for
the
lives
of
us
and
all
converging
towards
the
middle
held
our
tools
and
listened
the
other
men
heard
nothing
at
all
or
declared
that
they
heard
nothing
being
anxious
now
to
abandon
the
matter
because
of
the
chill
in
their
feet
and
knees
but
i
said
go
if
you
choose
all
of
you
i
will
work
it
out
by
myself
you
piecrusts
and
upon
that
they
gripped
their
shovels
being
more
or
less
of
englishmen
and
the
least
drop
of
english
blood
is
worth
the
best
of
any
other
when
it
comes
to
lasting
out
but
before
we
began
again
i
laid
my
head
well
into
the
chamber
and
there
i
hears
a
faint
maaah
coming
through
some
ells
of
snow
like
a
plaintive
buried
hope
or
a
last
appeal
i
shouted
aloud
to
cheer
him
up
for
i
knew
what
sheep
it
was
to
wit
the
most
valiant
of
all
the
wethers
who
had
met
me
when
i
came
home
from
london
and
been
so
glad
to
see
me
and
then
we
all
fell
to
again
and
very
soon
we
hauled
him
out
watch
took
charge
of
him
at
once
with
an
air
of
the
noblest
patronage
lying
on
his
frozen
fleece
and
licking
all
his
face
and
feet
to
restore
his
warmth
to
him
then
fighting
tom
jumped
up
at
once
and
made
a
little
butt
at
watch
as
if
nothing
had
ever
ailed
him
and
then
set
off
to
a
shallow
place
and
looked
for
something
to
nibble
at
further
in
and
close
under
the
bank
where
they
had
huddled
themselves
for
warmth
we
found
all
the
rest
of
the
poor
sheep
packed
as
closely
as
if
they
were
in
a
great
pie
it
was
strange
to
observe
how
their
vapour
and
breath
and
the
moisture
exuding
from
their
wool
had
scooped
as
it
were
a
coved
room
for
them
lined
with
a
ribbing
of
deep
yellow
snow
also
the
churned
snow
beneath
their
feet
was
as
yellow
as
gamboge
two
or
three
of
the
weaklier
hoggets
were
dead
from
want
of
air
and
from
pressure
but
more
than
threescore
were
as
lively
as
ever
though
cramped
and
stiff
for
a
little
while
however
shall
us
get
em
home
john
fry
asked
in
great
dismay
when
we
had
cleared
about
a
dozen
of
them
which
we
were
forced
to
do
very
carefully
so
as
not
to
fetch
the
roof
down
no
manner
of
maning
to
draive
un
drough
all
they
girt
driftnesses
you
see
to
this
place
john
i
replied
as
we
leaned
on
our
shovels
a
moment
and
the
sheep
came
rubbing
round
us
let
no
more
of
them
out
for
the
present
they
are
better
where
they
be
watch
here
boy
keep
them
watch
came
with
his
little
scut
of
a
tail
cocked
as
sharp
as
duty
and
i
set
him
at
the
narrow
mouth
of
the
great
snow
antre
all
the
sheep
sidled
away
and
got
closer
that
the
other
sheep
might
be
bitten
first
as
the
foolish
things
imagine
whereas
no
good
sheepdog
even
so
much
as
lips
a
sheep
to
turn
it
then
of
the
outer
sheep
all
now
snowed
and
frizzled
like
a
lawyers
wig
i
took
the
two
finest
and
heaviest
and
with
one
beneath
my
right
arm
and
the
other
beneath
my
left
i
went
straight
home
to
the
upper
sheppey
and
set
them
inside
and
fastened
them
sixty
and
six
i
took
home
in
that
way
two
at
a
time
on
each
joumey
and
the
work
grew
harder
and
harder
each
time
as
the
drifts
of
the
snow
were
deepening
no
other
man
should
meddle
with
them
i
was
resolved
to
try
my
strength
against
the
strength
of
the
elements
and
try
it
i
did
ay
and
proved
it
a
certain
fierce
delight
burned
in
me
as
the
struggle
grew
harder
but
rather
would
i
die
than
yield
and
at
last
i
finished
it
people
talk
of
it
to
this
day
but
none
can
tell
what
the
labour
was
who
have
not
felt
that
snow
and
wind
of
the
sheep
upon
the
mountain
and
the
sheep
upon
the
western
farm
and
the
cattle
on
the
upper
barrows
scarcely
one
in
ten
was
saved
do
what
we
would
for
them
and
this
was
not
through
any
neglect
now
that
our
wits
were
sharpened
but
from
the
pure
impossibility
of
finding
them
at
all
that
great
snow
never
ceased
a
moment
for
three
days
and
nights
and
then
when
all
the
earth
was
filled
and
the
topmost
hedges
were
unseen
and
the
trees
broke
down
with
weight
wherever
the
wind
had
not
lightened
them
a
brilliant
sun
broke
forth
and
showed
the
loss
of
all
our
customs
all
our
house
was
quite
snowed
up
except
where
we
had
purged
a
way
by
dint
of
constant
shovellings
the
kitchen
was
as
dark
and
darker
than
the
cidercellar
and
long
lines
of
furrowed
scollops
ran
even
up
to
the
chimneystacks
several
windows
fell
right
inwards
through
the
weight
of
the
snow
against
them
and
the
few
that
stood
bulged
in
and
bent
like
an
old
bruised
lanthorn
we
were
obliged
to
cook
by
candlelight
we
were
forced
to
read
by
candlelight
as
for
baking
we
could
not
do
it
because
the
oven
was
too
chill
and
a
load
of
faggots
only
brought
a
little
wet
down
the
sides
of
it
for
when
the
sun
burst
forth
at
last
upon
that
world
of
white
what
he
brought
was
neither
warmth
nor
cheer
nor
hope
of
softening
only
a
clearer
shaft
of
cold
from
the
violet
depths
of
sky
longdrawn
alleys
of
white
haze
seemed
to
lead
towards
him
yet
such
as
he
could
not
come
down
with
any
warmth
remaining
broad
white
curtains
of
the
frostfog
looped
around
the
lower
sky
on
the
verge
of
hill
and
valley
and
above
the
laden
trees
only
round
the
sun
himself
and
the
spot
of
heaven
he
claimed
clustered
a
bright
purpleblue
clear
and
calm
and
deep
that
night
such
a
frost
ensued
as
we
had
never
dreamed
of
neither
read
in
ancient
books
or
histories
of
frobisher
the
kettle
by
the
fire
froze
and
the
crock
upon
the
hearthcheeks
many
men
were
killed
and
cattle
rigid
in
their
headropes
then
i
heard
that
fearful
sound
which
never
i
had
heard
before
neither
since
have
heard
except
during
that
same
winter
the
sharp
yet
solemn
sound
of
trees
burst
open
by
the
frostblow
our
great
walnut
lost
three
branches
and
has
been
dying
ever
since
though
growing
meanwhile
as
the
soul
does
and
the
ancient
oak
at
the
cross
was
rent
and
many
score
of
ash
trees
but
why
should
i
tell
all
this
the
people
who
have
not
seen
it
as
i
have
will
only
make
faces
and
disbelieve
till
such
another
frost
comes
which
perhaps
may
never
be
this
terrible
weather
kept
tom
faggus
from
coming
near
our
house
for
weeks
at
which
indeed
i
was
not
vexed
a
quarter
so
much
as
annie
was
for
i
had
never
half
approved
of
him
as
a
husband
for
my
sister
in
spite
of
his
purchase
from
squire
bassett
and
the
grant
of
the
royal
pardon
it
may
be
however
that
annie
took
the
same
view
of
my
love
for
lorna
and
could
not
augur
well
of
it
but
if
so
she
held
her
peace
though
i
was
not
so
sparing
for
many
things
contributed
to
make
me
less
goodhumoured
now
than
my
real
nature
was
and
the
very
least
of
all
these
things
would
have
been
enough
to
make
some
people
cross
and
rude
and
fractious
i
mean
the
red
and
painful
chapping
of
my
face
and
hands
from
working
in
the
snow
all
day
and
lying
in
the
frost
all
night
for
being
of
a
fair
complexion
and
a
ruddy
nature
and
pretty
plump
withal
and
fed
on
plenty
of
hot
victuals
and
always
forced
by
my
mother
to
sit
nearer
the
fire
than
i
wished
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
the
cold
ran
revel
on
my
cheeks
and
knuckles
and
i
feared
that
lorna
if
it
should
ever
please
god
to
stop
the
snowing
might
take
this
for
a
proof
of
low
and
rustic
blood
and
breeding
and
this
i
say
was
the
smallest
thing
for
it
was
far
more
serious
that
we
were
losing
half
our
stock
do
all
we
would
to
shelter
them
even
the
horses
in
the
stables
mustered
all
together
for
the
sake
of
breath
and
steaming
had
long
icicles
from
their
muzzles
almost
every
morning
but
of
all
things
the
very
gravest
to
my
apprehension
was
the
impossibility
of
hearing
or
having
any
token
of
or
from
my
loved
one
not
that
those
three
days
alone
of
snow
tremendous
as
it
was
could
have
blocked
the
country
so
but
that
the
sky
had
never
ceased
for
more
than
two
days
at
a
time
for
full
three
weeks
thereafter
to
pour
fresh
piles
of
fleecy
mantle
neither
had
the
wind
relaxed
a
single
day
from
shaking
them
as
a
rule
it
snowed
all
day
cleared
up
at
night
and
froze
intensely
with
the
stars
as
bright
as
jewels
earth
spread
out
in
lustrous
twilight
and
the
sounds
in
the
air
as
sharp
and
crackling
as
artillery
then
in
the
morning
snow
again
before
the
sun
could
come
to
help
it
mattered
not
what
way
the
wind
was
often
and
often
the
vanes
went
round
and
we
hoped
for
change
of
weather
the
only
change
was
that
it
seemed
if
possible
to
grow
colder
indeed
after
a
week
or
so
the
wind
would
regularly
box
the
compass
as
the
sailors
call
it
in
the
course
of
every
day
following
where
the
sun
should
be
as
if
to
make
a
mock
of
him
and
this
of
course
immensely
added
to
the
peril
of
the
drifts
because
they
shifted
every
day
and
no
skill
or
care
might
learn
them
i
believe
it
was
on
epiphany
morning
or
somewhere
about
that
period
when
lizzie
ran
into
the
kitchen
to
me
where
i
was
thawing
my
goosegrease
with
the
dogs
among
the
ashesthe
live
dogs
i
mean
not
the
iron
ones
for
them
we
had
given
up
long
agoand
having
caught
me
by
way
of
wonder
for
generally
i
was
out
shoveling
long
before
my
young
lady
had
her
nightcap
off
she
positively
kissed
me
for
the
sake
of
warming
her
lips
perhaps
or
because
she
had
something
proud
to
say
you
great
fool
john
said
my
lady
as
annie
and
i
used
to
call
her
on
account
of
her
airs
and
graces
what
a
pity
you
never
read
john
much
use
i
should
think
in
reading
i
answered
though
pleased
with
her
condescension
read
i
suppose
with
roof
coming
in
and
only
this
chimney
left
sticking
out
of
the
snow
the
very
time
to
read
john
said
lizzie
looking
grander
our
worst
troubles
are
the
need
whence
knowledge
can
deliver
us
amen
i
cried
out
are
you
parson
or
clerk
whichever
you
are
goodmorning
thereupon
i
was
bent
on
my
usual
round
a
very
small
one
nowadays
but
eliza
took
me
with
both
hands
and
i
stopped
of
course
for
i
could
not
bear
to
shake
the
child
even
in
play
for
a
moment
because
her
back
was
tender
then
she
looked
up
at
me
with
her
beautiful
eyes
so
large
unhealthy
and
delicate
and
strangely
shadowing
outward
as
if
to
spread
their
meaning
and
she
said
now
john
this
is
no
time
to
joke
i
was
almost
frozen
in
bed
last
night
and
annie
like
an
icicle
feel
how
cold
my
hands
are
now
will
you
listen
to
what
i
have
read
about
climates
ten
times
worse
than
this
and
where
none
but
clever
men
can
live
impossible
for
me
to
listen
now
i
have
hundreds
of
things
to
see
to
but
i
will
listen
after
breakfast
to
your
foreign
climates
child
now
attend
to
mothers
hot
coffee
she
looked
a
little
disappointed
but
she
knew
what
i
had
to
do
and
after
all
she
was
not
so
utterly
unreasonable
although
she
did
read
books
and
when
i
had
done
my
mornings
work
i
listened
to
her
patiently
and
it
was
out
of
my
power
to
think
that
all
she
said
was
foolish
for
i
knew
common
sense
pretty
well
by
this
time
whether
it
happened
to
be
my
own
or
any
other
persons
if
clearly
laid
before
me
and
lizzie
had
a
particular
way
of
setting
forth
very
clearly
whatever
she
wished
to
express
and
enforce
but
the
queerest
part
of
it
all
was
this
that
if
she
could
but
have
dreamed
for
a
moment
what
would
be
the
first
application
made
me
by
of
her
lesson
she
would
rather
have
bitten
her
tongue
off
than
help
me
to
my
purpose
she
told
me
that
in
the
arctic
regions
as
they
call
some
places
a
long
way
north
where
the
great
bear
lies
all
across
the
heavens
and
no
sun
is
up
for
whole
months
at
a
time
and
yet
where
people
will
go
exploring
out
of
pure
contradiction
and
for
the
sake
of
novelty
and
love
of
being
frozenthat
here
they
always
had
such
winters
as
we
were
having
now
it
never
ceased
to
freeze
she
said
and
it
never
ceased
to
snow
except
when
it
was
too
cold
and
then
all
the
air
was
choked
with
glittering
spikes
and
a
mans
skin
might
come
off
of
him
before
he
could
ask
the
reason
nevertheless
the
people
there
although
the
snow
was
fifty
feet
deep
and
all
their
breath
fell
behind
them
frozen
like
a
log
of
wood
dropped
from
their
shoulders
yet
they
managed
to
get
along
and
make
the
time
of
the
year
to
each
other
by
a
little
cleverness
for
seeing
how
the
snow
was
spread
lightly
over
everything
covering
up
the
hills
and
valleys
and
the
foreskin
of
the
sea
they
contrived
a
way
to
crown
it
and
to
glide
like
a
flake
along
through
the
sparkle
of
the
whiteness
and
the
wreaths
of
windy
tossings
and
the
ups
and
downs
of
cold
any
man
might
get
along
with
a
boat
on
either
foot
to
prevent
his
sinking
she
told
me
how
these
boats
were
made
very
strong
and
very
light
of
ribs
with
skin
across
them
five
feet
long
and
one
foot
wide
and
turned
up
at
each
end
even
as
a
canoe
is
but
she
did
not
tell
me
nor
did
i
give
it
a
moments
thought
myself
how
hard
it
was
to
walk
upon
them
without
early
practice
then
she
told
me
another
thing
equally
useful
to
me
although
i
would
not
let
her
see
how
much
i
thought
about
it
and
this
concerned
the
use
of
sledges
and
their
power
of
gliding
and
the
lightness
of
their
following
all
of
which
i
could
see
at
once
through
knowledge
of
our
own
farmsleds
which
we
employ
in
lieu
of
wheels
used
in
flatter
districts
when
i
had
heard
all
this
from
her
a
mere
chit
of
a
girl
as
she
was
unfit
to
make
a
snowball
even
or
to
fry
snow
pancakes
i
looked
down
on
her
with
amazement
and
began
to
wish
a
little
that
i
had
given
more
time
to
books
but
god
shapes
all
our
fitness
and
gives
each
man
his
meaning
even
as
he
guides
the
wavering
lines
of
snow
descending
our
eliza
was
meant
for
books
our
dear
annie
for
loving
and
cooking
i
john
ridd
for
sheep
and
wrestling
and
the
thought
of
lorna
and
mother
to
love
all
three
of
us
and
to
make
the
best
of
her
children
and
now
if
i
must
tell
the
truth
as
at
every
page
i
try
to
do
though
god
knows
it
is
hard
enough
i
had
felt
through
all
this
weather
though
my
life
was
lornas
something
of
a
satisfaction
in
so
doing
duty
to
my
kindest
and
best
of
mothers
and
to
none
but
her
for
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
a
mans
young
love
is
very
pleasant
very
sweet
and
tickling
and
takes
him
through
the
core
of
heart
without
his
knowing
how
or
why
then
he
dwells
upon
it
sideways
without
people
looking
and
builds
up
all
sorts
of
fancies
growing
hot
with
working
so
at
his
own
imaginings
so
his
love
is
a
crystal
goddess
set
upon
an
obelisk
and
whoever
will
not
bow
the
knee
yet
without
glancing
at
her
the
lover
makes
it
a
sacred
rite
either
to
kick
or
to
stick
him
i
am
not
speaking
of
me
and
lorna
but
of
common
people
then
if
you
come
to
think
again
loor
i
will
not
say
lo
for
no
one
can
behold
itonly
feel
or
but
remember
what
a
real
mother
is
ever
loving
ever
soft
ever
turning
sin
to
goodness
vices
into
virtues
blind
to
all
ninetenths
of
wrong
through
a
telescope
beholding
though
herself
so
nigh
to
them
faintest
decimal
of
promise
even
in
her
vilest
child
ready
to
thank
god
again
as
when
her
babe
was
born
to
her
leaping
as
at
kingdomcome
at
a
wandering
syllable
of
gospel
for
her
lost
one
all
this
our
mother
was
to
us
and
even
more
than
all
of
this
and
hence
i
felt
a
pride
and
joy
in
doing
my
sacred
duty
towards
her
now
that
the
weather
compelled
me
and
she
was
as
grateful
and
delighted
as
if
she
had
no
more
claim
upon
me
than
a
strangers
sheep
might
have
yet
from
time
to
time
i
groaned
within
myself
and
by
myself
at
thinking
of
my
sad
debarment
from
the
sight
of
lorna
and
of
all
that
might
have
happened
to
her
now
she
had
no
protection
therefore
i
fell
to
at
once
upon
that
hint
from
lizzie
and
being
used
to
thatchingwork
and
the
making
of
traps
and
so
on
before
very
long
i
built
myself
a
pair
of
strong
and
light
snowshoes
framed
with
ash
and
ribbed
of
withy
with
halftanned
calfskin
stretched
across
and
an
inner
sole
to
support
my
feet
at
first
i
could
not
walk
at
all
but
floundered
about
most
piteously
catching
one
shoe
in
the
other
and
both
of
them
in
the
snowdrifts
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
girls
who
were
come
to
look
at
me
but
after
a
while
i
grew
more
expert
discovering
what
my
errors
were
and
altering
the
inclination
of
the
shoes
themselves
according
to
a
print
which
lizzie
found
in
a
book
of
adventures
and
this
made
such
a
difference
that
i
crossed
the
farmyard
and
came
back
again
though
turning
was
the
worst
thing
of
all
without
so
much
as
falling
once
or
getting
my
staff
entangled
but
oh
the
aching
of
my
ankles
when
i
went
to
bed
that
night
i
was
forced
to
help
myself
upstairs
with
a
couple
of
mopsticks
and
i
rubbed
the
joints
with
neatsfoot
oil
which
comforted
them
greatly
and
likely
enough
i
would
have
abandoned
any
further
trial
but
for
lizzies
ridicule
and
pretended
sympathy
asking
if
the
strong
john
ridd
would
have
old
betty
to
lean
upon
therefore
i
set
to
again
with
a
fixed
resolve
not
to
notice
pain
or
stiffness
but
to
warm
them
out
of
me
and
sure
enough
before
dark
that
day
i
could
get
along
pretty
freely
especially
improving
every
time
after
leaving
off
and
resting
the
astonishment
of
poor
john
fry
bill
dadds
and
jem
slocombe
when
they
saw
me
coming
down
the
hill
upon
them
in
the
twilight
where
they
were
clearing
the
furze
rick
and
trussing
it
for
cattle
was
more
than
i
can
tell
you
because
they
did
not
let
me
see
it
but
ran
away
with
one
accord
and
floundered
into
a
snowdrift
they
believed
and
so
did
every
one
else
especially
when
i
grew
able
to
glide
along
pretty
rapidly
that
i
had
stolen
mother
melldrums
sieves
on
which
she
was
said
to
fly
over
the
foreland
at
midnight
every
saturday
upon
the
following
day
i
held
some
council
with
my
mother
not
liking
to
go
without
her
permission
yet
scarcely
daring
to
ask
for
it
but
here
she
disappointed
me
on
the
right
side
of
disappointment
saying
that
she
had
seen
my
pining
which
she
never
could
have
done
because
i
had
been
too
hard
at
work
and
rather
than
watch
me
grieving
so
for
somebody
or
other
who
now
was
all
in
all
to
me
i
might
go
upon
my
course
and
gods
protection
go
with
me
at
this
i
was
amazed
because
it
was
not
at
all
like
mother
and
knowing
how
well
i
had
behaved
ever
since
the
time
of
our
snowing
up
i
was
a
little
moved
to
tell
her
that
she
could
not
understand
me
however
my
sense
of
duty
kept
me
and
my
knowledge
of
the
catechism
from
saying
such
a
thing
as
that
or
even
thinking
twice
of
it
and
so
i
took
her
at
her
word
which
she
was
not
prepared
for
and
telling
her
how
proud
i
was
of
her
trust
in
providence
and
how
i
could
run
in
my
new
snowshoes
i
took
a
short
pipe
in
my
mouth
and
started
forth
accordingly
chapter
xliii
not
too
soon
when
i
started
on
my
road
across
the
hills
and
valleys
which
now
were
pretty
much
alike
the
utmost
i
could
hope
to
do
was
to
gain
the
crest
of
hills
and
look
into
the
doone
glen
hence
i
might
at
least
descry
whether
lorna
still
was
safe
by
the
six
nests
still
remaining
and
the
view
of
the
captains
house
when
i
was
come
to
the
open
country
far
beyond
the
sheltered
homestead
and
in
the
full
brunt
of
the
wind
the
keen
blast
of
the
cold
broke
on
me
and
the
mighty
breadth
of
snow
moor
and
highland
field
and
common
cliff
and
vale
and
watercourse
over
all
the
rolling
folds
of
misty
white
were
flung
there
was
nothing
square
or
jagged
left
there
was
nothing
perpendicular
all
the
rugged
lines
were
eased
and
all
the
breaches
smoothly
filled
curves
and
mounds
and
rounded
heavings
took
the
place
of
rock
and
stump
and
all
the
country
looked
as
if
a
womans
hand
had
been
on
it
through
the
sparkling
breadth
of
white
which
seemed
to
glance
my
eyes
away
and
outside
the
humps
of
laden
trees
bowing
their
backs
like
a
woodman
i
contrived
to
get
along
halfsliding
and
halfwalking
in
places
where
a
plainshodden
man
must
have
sunk
and
waited
freezing
till
the
thaw
should
come
to
him
for
although
there
had
been
such
violent
frost
every
night
upon
the
snow
the
snow
itself
having
never
thawed
even
for
an
hour
had
never
coated
over
hence
it
was
as
soft
and
light
as
if
all
had
fallen
yesterday
in
places
where
no
drift
had
been
but
rather
off
than
on
to
them
three
feet
was
the
least
of
depth
but
where
the
wind
had
chased
it
round
or
any
draught
led
like
a
funnel
or
anything
opposed
it
there
you
might
very
safely
say
that
it
ran
up
to
twenty
feet
or
thirty
or
even
fifty
and
i
believe
some
times
a
hundred
at
last
i
got
to
my
spyhill
as
i
had
begun
to
call
it
although
i
never
should
have
known
it
but
for
what
it
looked
on
and
even
to
know
this
last
again
required
all
the
eyes
of
love
soever
sharp
and
vigilant
for
all
the
beautiful
glen
doone
shaped
from
out
the
mountains
as
if
on
purpose
for
the
doones
and
looking
in
the
summertime
like
a
sharp
cut
vase
of
green
now
was
besnowed
half
up
the
sides
and
at
either
end
so
that
it
was
more
like
the
white
basins
wherein
we
boil
plumpuddings
not
a
patch
of
grass
was
there
not
a
black
branch
of
a
tree
all
was
white
and
the
little
river
flowed
beneath
an
arch
of
snow
if
it
managed
to
flow
at
all
now
this
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
not
only
because
i
believed
glen
doone
to
be
a
place
outside
all
frost
but
also
because
i
thought
perhaps
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
be
cold
near
lorna
and
now
it
struck
me
all
at
once
that
perhaps
her
ewer
was
frozen
as
mine
had
been
for
the
last
three
weeks
requiring
embers
around
it
and
perhaps
her
window
would
not
shut
any
more
than
mine
would
and
perhaps
she
wanted
blankets
this
idea
worked
me
up
to
such
a
chill
of
sympathy
that
seeing
no
doones
now
about
and
doubting
if
any
guns
would
go
off
in
this
state
of
the
weather
and
knowing
that
no
man
could
catch
me
up
except
with
shoes
like
mine
i
even
resolved
to
slide
the
cliffs
and
bravely
go
to
lorna
it
helped
me
much
in
this
resolve
that
the
snow
came
on
again
thick
enough
to
blind
a
man
who
had
not
spent
his
time
among
it
as
i
had
done
now
for
days
and
days
therefore
i
took
my
neatsfoot
oil
which
now
was
clogged
like
honey
and
rubbed
it
hard
into
my
legjoints
so
far
as
i
could
reach
them
and
then
i
set
my
back
and
elbows
well
against
a
snowdrift
hanging
far
adown
the
cliff
and
saying
some
of
the
lords
prayer
threw
myself
on
providence
before
there
was
time
to
think
or
dream
i
landed
very
beautifully
upon
a
ridge
of
runup
snow
in
a
quiet
corner
my
good
shoes
or
boots
preserved
me
from
going
far
beneath
it
though
one
of
them
was
sadly
strained
where
a
grub
had
gnawed
the
ash
in
the
early
summertime
having
set
myself
aright
and
being
in
good
spirits
i
made
boldly
across
the
valley
where
the
snow
was
furrowed
hard
being
now
afraid
of
nobody
if
lorna
had
looked
out
of
the
window
she
would
not
have
known
me
with
those
boots
upon
my
feet
and
a
wellcleaned
sheepskin
over
me
bearing
my
own
jr
in
red
just
between
my
shoulders
but
covered
now
in
snowflakes
the
house
was
partly
drifted
up
though
not
so
much
as
ours
was
and
i
crossed
the
little
stream
almost
without
knowing
that
it
was
under
me
at
first
being
pretty
safe
from
interference
from
the
other
huts
by
virtue
of
the
blinding
snow
and
the
difficulty
of
walking
i
examined
all
the
windows
but
these
were
coated
so
with
ice
like
ferns
and
flowers
and
dazzling
stars
that
no
one
could
so
much
as
guess
what
might
be
inside
of
them
moreover
i
was
afraid
of
prying
narrowly
into
them
as
it
was
not
a
proper
thing
where
a
maiden
might
be
only
i
wanted
to
know
just
this
whether
she
were
there
or
not
taking
nothing
by
this
movement
i
was
forced
much
against
my
will
to
venture
to
the
door
and
knock
in
a
hesitating
manner
not
being
sure
but
what
my
answer
might
be
the
mouth
of
a
carbine
however
it
was
not
so
for
i
heard
a
pattering
of
feet
and
a
whispering
going
on
and
then
a
shrill
voice
through
the
keyhole
asking
whos
there
only
me
john
ridd
i
answered
upon
which
i
heard
a
little
laughter
and
a
little
sobbing
or
something
that
was
like
it
and
then
the
door
was
opened
about
a
couple
of
inches
with
a
bar
behind
it
still
and
then
the
little
voice
went
on
put
thy
finger
in
young
man
with
the
old
ring
on
it
but
mind
thee
if
it
be
the
wrong
one
thou
shalt
never
draw
it
back
again
laughing
at
gwennys
mighty
threat
i
showed
my
finger
in
the
opening
upon
which
she
let
me
in
and
barred
the
door
again
like
lightning
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
gwenny
i
asked
as
i
slipped
about
on
the
floor
for
i
could
not
stand
there
firmly
with
my
great
snowshoes
on
maning
enough
and
bad
maning
too
the
cornish
girl
made
answer
us
be
shut
in
here
and
starving
and
durstnt
let
anybody
in
upon
us
i
wish
thou
wert
good
to
ate
young
man
i
could
manage
most
of
thee
i
was
so
frightened
by
her
eyes
full
of
wolfish
hunger
that
i
could
only
say
good
god
having
never
seen
the
like
before
then
drew
i
forth
a
large
piece
of
bread
which
i
had
brought
in
case
of
accidents
and
placed
it
in
her
hands
she
leaped
at
it
as
a
starving
dog
leaps
at
sight
of
his
supper
and
she
set
her
teeth
in
it
and
then
withheld
it
from
her
lips
with
something
very
like
an
oath
at
her
own
vile
greediness
and
then
away
round
the
corner
with
it
no
doubt
for
her
young
mistress
i
meanwhile
was
occupied
to
the
best
of
my
ability
in
taking
my
snowshoes
off
yet
wondering
much
within
myself
why
lorna
did
not
come
to
me
but
presently
i
knew
the
cause
for
gwenny
called
me
and
i
ran
and
found
my
darling
quite
unable
to
say
so
much
as
john
how
are
you
between
the
hunger
and
the
cold
and
the
excitement
of
my
coming
she
had
fainted
away
and
lay
back
on
a
chair
as
white
as
the
snow
around
us
in
betwixt
her
delicate
lips
gwenny
was
thrusting
with
all
her
strength
the
hard
brown
crust
of
the
ryebread
which
she
had
snatched
from
me
so
get
water
or
get
snow
i
said
dont
you
know
what
fainting
is
you
very
stupid
child
never
heerd
on
it
in
cornwall
she
answered
trusting
still
to
the
bread
be
un
the
same
as
bleeding
it
will
be
directly
if
you
go
on
squeezing
away
with
that
crust
so
eat
a
piece
i
have
got
some
more
leave
my
darling
now
to
me
hearing
that
i
had
some
more
the
starving
girl
could
resist
no
longer
but
tore
it
in
two
and
had
swallowed
half
before
i
had
coaxed
my
lorna
back
to
sense
and
hope
and
joy
and
love
i
never
expected
to
see
you
again
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
die
john
and
to
die
without
your
knowing
it
as
i
repelled
this
fearful
thought
in
a
manner
highly
fortifying
the
tender
hue
flowed
back
again
into
her
famished
cheeks
and
lips
and
a
softer
brilliance
glistened
from
the
depth
of
her
dark
eyes
she
gave
me
one
little
shrunken
hand
and
i
could
not
help
a
tear
for
it
after
all
mistress
lorna
i
said
pretending
to
be
gay
for
a
smile
might
do
her
good
you
do
not
love
me
as
gwenny
does
for
she
even
wanted
to
eat
me
and
shall
afore
i
have
done
young
man
gwenny
answered
laughing
you
come
in
here
with
they
red
chakes
and
make
us
think
o
sirloin
eat
up
your
bit
of
brown
bread
gwenny
it
is
not
good
enough
for
your
mistress
bless
her
heart
i
have
something
here
such
as
she
never
tasted
the
like
of
being
in
such
appetite
look
here
lorna
smell
it
first
i
have
had
it
ever
since
twelfth
day
and
kept
it
all
the
time
for
you
annie
made
it
that
is
enough
to
warrant
it
good
cooking
and
then
i
showed
my
great
mincepie
in
a
bag
of
tissue
paper
and
i
told
them
how
the
mincemeat
was
made
of
golden
pippins
finely
shred
with
the
undercut
of
the
sirloin
and
spice
and
fruit
accordingly
and
far
beyond
my
knowledge
but
lorna
would
not
touch
a
morsel
until
she
had
thanked
god
for
it
and
given
me
the
kindest
kiss
and
put
a
piece
in
gwennys
mouth
i
have
eaten
many
things
myself
with
very
great
enjoyment
and
keen
perception
of
their
merits
and
some
thanks
to
god
for
them
but
i
never
did
enjoy
a
thing
that
had
found
its
way
between
my
own
lips
half
or
even
a
quarter
as
much
as
i
now
enjoyed
beholding
lorna
sitting
proudly
upwards
to
show
that
she
was
faint
no
more
entering
into
that
mincepie
and
moving
all
her
pearls
of
teeth
inside
her
little
mouthplace
exactly
as
i
told
her
for
i
was
afraid
lest
she
should
be
too
fast
in
going
through
it
and
cause
herself
more
damage
so
than
she
got
of
nourishment
but
i
had
no
need
to
fear
at
all
and
lorna
could
not
help
laughing
at
me
for
thinking
that
she
had
no
selfcontrol
some
creatures
require
a
deal
of
food
i
myself
among
the
number
and
some
can
do
with
a
very
little
making
no
doubt
the
best
of
it
and
i
have
often
noticed
that
the
plumpest
and
most
perfect
women
never
eat
so
hard
and
fast
as
the
skinny
and
threecornered
ones
these
last
be
often
ashamed
of
it
and
eat
most
when
the
men
be
absent
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
lorna
being
the
loveliest
of
all
maidens
had
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
finish
her
own
half
of
pie
whereas
gwenny
carfax
though
generous
more
than
greedy
ate
up
hers
without
winking
after
finishing
the
brown
loaf
and
then
i
begged
to
know
the
meaning
of
this
state
of
things
the
meaning
is
sad
enough
said
lorna
and
i
see
no
way
out
of
it
we
are
both
to
be
starved
until
i
let
them
do
what
they
like
with
me
that
is
to
say
until
you
choose
to
marry
carver
doone
and
be
slowly
killed
by
him
slowly
no
john
quickly
i
hate
him
so
intensely
that
less
than
a
week
would
kill
me
not
a
doubt
of
that
said
gwenny
oh
she
hates
him
nicely
then
but
not
half
so
much
as
i
do
i
told
them
that
this
state
of
things
could
be
endured
no
longer
on
which
point
they
agreed
with
me
but
saw
no
means
to
help
it
for
even
if
lorna
could
make
up
her
mind
to
come
away
with
me
and
live
at
plovers
barrows
farm
under
my
good
mothers
care
as
i
had
urged
so
often
behold
the
snow
was
all
around
us
heaped
as
high
as
mountains
and
how
could
any
delicate
maiden
ever
get
across
it
then
i
spoke
with
a
strange
tingle
upon
both
sides
of
my
heart
knowing
that
this
undertaking
was
a
serious
one
for
all
and
might
burn
our
farm
down
if
i
warrant
to
take
you
safe
and
without
much
fright
or
hardship
lorna
will
you
come
with
me
to
be
sure
i
will
dear
said
my
beauty
with
a
smile
and
a
glance
to
follow
it
i
have
small
alternative
to
starve
or
go
with
you
john
gwenny
have
you
courage
for
it
will
you
come
with
your
young
mistress
will
i
stay
behind
cried
gwenny
in
a
voice
that
settled
it
and
so
we
began
to
arrange
about
it
and
i
was
much
excited
it
was
useless
now
to
leave
it
longer
if
it
could
be
done
at
all
it
could
not
be
too
quickly
done
it
was
the
counsellor
who
had
ordered
after
all
other
schemes
had
failed
that
his
niece
should
have
no
food
until
she
would
obey
him
he
had
strictly
watched
the
house
taking
turns
with
carver
to
ensure
that
none
came
nigh
it
bearing
food
or
comfort
but
this
evening
they
had
thought
it
needless
to
remain
on
guard
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
because
themselves
were
busy
offering
high
festival
to
all
the
valley
in
right
of
their
own
commandership
and
gwenny
said
that
nothing
made
her
so
nearly
mad
with
appetite
as
the
account
she
received
from
a
woman
of
all
the
dishes
preparing
nevertheless
she
had
answered
bravely
go
and
tell
the
counsellor
and
go
and
tell
the
carver
who
sent
you
to
spy
upon
us
that
we
shall
have
a
finer
dish
than
any
set
before
them
and
so
in
truth
they
did
although
so
little
dreaming
it
for
no
doone
that
was
ever
born
however
much
of
a
carver
might
vie
with
our
annie
for
mincemeat
now
while
we
sat
reflecting
much
and
talking
a
good
deal
more
in
spite
of
all
the
coldfor
i
never
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
when
i
had
lorna
with
meshe
said
in
her
silvery
voice
which
always
led
me
so
along
as
if
i
were
a
slave
to
a
beautiful
bell
now
john
we
are
wasting
time
dear
you
have
praised
my
hair
till
it
curls
with
pride
and
my
eyes
till
you
cannot
see
them
even
if
they
are
brown
diamonds
which
i
have
heard
for
the
fiftieth
time
at
least
though
i
never
saw
such
a
jewel
dont
you
think
it
is
high
time
to
put
on
your
snowshoes
john
certainly
not
i
answered
till
we
have
settled
something
more
i
was
so
cold
when
i
came
in
and
now
i
am
as
warm
as
a
cricket
and
so
are
you
you
lively
soul
though
you
are
not
upon
my
hearth
yet
remember
john
said
lorna
nestling
for
a
moment
to
me
the
severity
of
the
weather
makes
a
great
difference
between
us
and
you
must
never
take
advantage
i
quite
understand
all
that
dear
and
the
harder
it
freezes
the
better
while
that
understanding
continues
now
do
try
to
be
serious
i
try
to
be
serious
and
i
have
been
trying
fifty
times
and
could
not
bring
you
to
it
john
although
i
am
sure
the
situation
as
the
counsellor
says
at
the
beginning
of
a
speech
the
situation
to
say
the
least
is
serious
enough
for
anything
come
gwenny
imitate
him
gwenny
was
famed
for
her
imitation
of
the
counsellor
making
a
speech
and
she
began
to
shake
her
hair
and
mount
upon
a
footstool
but
i
really
could
not
have
this
though
even
lorna
ordered
it
the
truth
was
that
my
darling
maiden
was
in
such
wild
spirits
at
seeing
me
so
unexpected
and
at
the
prospect
of
release
and
of
what
she
had
never
known
quiet
life
and
happiness
that
like
all
warm
and
loving
natures
she
could
scarce
control
herself
come
to
this
frozen
window
john
and
see
them
light
the
stackfire
they
will
little
know
who
looks
at
them
now
be
very
good
john
you
stay
in
that
corner
dear
and
i
will
stand
on
this
side
and
try
to
breathe
yourself
a
peephole
through
the
lovely
spears
and
banners
oh
you
dont
know
how
to
do
it
i
must
do
it
for
you
breathe
three
times
like
that
and
that
and
then
you
rub
it
with
your
fingers
before
it
has
time
to
freeze
again
all
this
she
did
so
beautifully
with
her
lips
put
up
like
cherries
and
her
fingers
bent
half
back
as
only
girls
can
bend
them
and
her
little
waist
thrown
out
against
the
white
of
the
snowedup
window
that
i
made
her
do
it
three
times
over
and
i
stopped
her
every
time
and
let
it
freeze
again
that
so
she
might
be
the
longer
now
i
knew
that
all
her
love
was
mine
every
bit
as
much
as
mine
was
hers
yet
i
must
have
her
to
show
it
dwelling
upon
every
proof
lengthening
out
all
certainty
perhaps
the
jealous
heart
is
loath
to
own
a
life
worth
twice
its
own
be
that
as
it
may
i
know
that
we
thawed
the
window
nicely
and
then
i
saw
far
down
the
stream
or
rather
down
the
bed
of
it
for
there
was
no
stream
visible
a
little
form
of
fire
arising
red
and
dark
and
flickering
presently
it
caught
on
something
and
went
upward
boldly
and
then
it
struck
into
many
forks
and
then
it
fell
and
rose
again
do
you
know
what
all
that
is
john
asked
lorna
smiling
cleverly
at
the
manner
of
my
staring
how
on
earth
should
i
know
papists
burn
protestants
in
the
flesh
and
protestants
burn
papists
in
effigy
as
we
mock
them
lorna
are
they
going
to
burn
any
one
tonight
no
you
dear
i
must
rid
you
of
these
things
i
see
that
you
are
bigoted
the
doones
are
firing
dunkery
beacon
to
celebrate
their
new
captain
but
how
could
they
bring
it
here
through
the
snow
if
they
have
sledges
i
can
do
nothing
they
brought
it
before
the
snow
began
the
moment
poor
grandfather
was
gone
even
before
his
funeral
the
young
men
having
none
to
check
them
began
at
once
upon
it
they
had
always
borne
a
grudge
against
it
not
that
it
ever
did
them
harm
but
because
it
seemed
so
insolent
cant
a
gentleman
go
home
without
a
smoke
behind
him
i
have
often
heard
them
saying
and
though
they
have
done
it
no
serious
harm
since
they
threw
the
firemen
on
the
fire
many
many
years
ago
they
have
often
promised
to
bring
it
here
for
their
candle
and
now
they
have
done
it
ah
now
look
the
tar
is
kindled
though
lorna
took
it
so
in
joke
i
looked
upon
it
very
gravely
knowing
that
this
heavy
outrage
to
the
feelings
of
the
neighbourhood
would
cause
more
stir
than
a
hundred
sheep
stolen
or
a
score
of
houses
sacked
not
of
course
that
the
beacon
was
of
the
smallest
use
to
any
one
neither
stopped
anybody
from
stealing
nay
rather
it
was
like
the
parish
knell
which
begins
when
all
is
over
and
depresses
all
the
survivors
yet
i
knew
that
we
valued
it
and
were
proud
and
spoke
of
it
as
a
mighty
institution
and
even
more
than
that
our
vestry
had
voted
within
the
last
two
years
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
to
pay
for
it
in
proportion
with
other
parishes
and
one
of
the
men
who
attended
to
it
or
at
least
who
was
paid
for
doing
so
was
our
jem
slocombes
grandfather
however
in
spite
of
all
my
regrets
the
fire
went
up
very
merrily
blazing
red
and
white
and
yellow
as
it
leaped
on
different
things
and
the
light
danced
on
the
snowdrifts
with
a
misty
lilac
hue
i
was
astonished
at
its
burning
in
such
mighty
depths
of
snow
but
gwenny
said
that
the
wicked
men
had
been
three
days
hard
at
work
clearing
as
it
were
a
cockpit
for
their
fire
to
have
its
way
and
now
they
had
a
mighty
pile
which
must
have
covered
five
landyards
square
heaped
up
to
a
goodly
height
and
eager
to
take
fire
in
this
i
saw
great
obstacle
to
what
i
wished
to
manage
for
when
this
pyramid
should
be
kindled
thoroughly
and
pouring
light
and
blazes
round
would
not
all
the
valley
be
like
a
white
room
full
of
candles
thinking
thus
i
was
half
inclined
to
abide
my
time
for
another
night
and
then
my
second
thoughts
convinced
me
that
i
would
be
a
fool
in
this
for
lo
what
an
opportunity
all
the
doones
would
be
drunk
of
course
in
about
three
hours
time
and
getting
more
and
more
in
drink
as
the
night
went
on
as
for
the
fire
it
must
sink
in
about
three
hours
or
more
and
only
cast
uncertain
shadows
friendly
to
my
purpose
and
then
the
outlaws
must
cower
round
it
as
the
cold
increased
on
them
helping
the
weight
of
the
liquor
and
in
their
jollity
any
noise
would
be
cheered
as
a
false
alarm
most
of
all
and
which
decided
once
for
all
my
actionwhen
these
wild
and
reckless
villains
should
be
hot
with
ardent
spirits
what
was
door
or
wall
to
stand
betwixt
them
and
my
lorna
this
thought
quickened
me
so
much
that
i
touched
my
darling
reverently
and
told
her
in
a
few
short
words
how
i
hoped
to
manage
it
sweetest
in
two
hours
time
i
shall
be
again
with
you
keep
the
bar
up
and
have
gwenny
ready
to
answer
any
one
you
are
safe
while
they
are
dining
dear
and
drinking
healths
and
all
that
stuff
and
before
they
have
done
with
that
i
shall
be
again
with
you
have
everything
you
care
to
take
in
a
very
little
compass
and
gwenny
must
have
no
baggage
i
shall
knock
loud
and
then
wait
a
little
and
then
knock
twice
very
softly
with
this
i
folded
her
in
my
arms
and
she
looked
frightened
at
me
not
having
perceived
her
danger
and
then
i
told
gwenny
over
again
what
i
had
told
her
mistress
but
she
only
nodded
her
head
and
said
young
man
go
and
teach
thy
grandmother
chapter
xliv
brought
home
at
last
to
my
great
delight
i
found
that
the
weather
not
often
friendly
to
lovers
and
lately
seeming
so
hostile
had
in
the
most
important
matter
done
me
a
signal
service
for
when
i
had
promised
to
take
my
love
from
the
power
of
those
wretches
the
only
way
of
escape
apparent
lay
through
the
main
doonegate
for
though
i
might
climb
the
cliffs
myself
especially
with
the
snow
to
aid
me
i
durst
not
try
to
fetch
lorna
up
them
even
if
she
were
not
halfstarved
as
well
as
partly
frozen
and
as
for
gwennys
door
as
we
called
it
that
is
to
say
the
little
entrance
from
the
wooded
hollow
it
was
snowed
up
long
ago
to
the
level
of
the
hills
around
therefore
i
was
at
my
wits
end
how
to
get
them
out
the
passage
by
the
doonegate
being
long
and
dark
and
difficult
and
leading
to
such
a
weary
circuit
among
the
snowy
moors
and
hills
but
now
being
homewardbound
by
the
shortest
possible
track
i
slipped
along
between
the
bonfire
and
the
boundary
cliffs
where
i
found
a
caved
way
of
snow
behind
a
sort
of
avalanche
so
that
if
the
doones
had
been
keeping
watch
which
they
were
not
doing
but
revelling
they
could
scarcely
have
discovered
me
and
when
i
came
to
my
old
ascent
where
i
had
often
scaled
the
cliff
and
made
across
the
mountains
it
struck
me
that
i
would
just
have
a
look
at
my
first
and
painful
entrance
to
wit
the
waterslide
i
never
for
a
moment
imagined
that
this
could
help
me
now
for
i
never
had
dared
to
descend
it
even
in
the
finest
weather
still
i
had
a
curiosity
to
know
what
my
old
friend
was
like
with
so
much
snow
upon
him
but
to
my
very
great
surprise
there
was
scarcely
any
snow
there
at
all
though
plenty
curling
high
overhead
from
the
cliff
like
bolsters
over
it
probably
the
sweeping
of
the
northeast
wind
up
the
narrow
chasm
had
kept
the
showers
from
blocking
it
although
the
water
had
no
power
under
the
bitter
grip
of
frost
all
my
waterslide
was
now
less
a
slide
than
path
of
ice
furrowed
where
the
waters
ran
over
fluted
ridges
seamed
where
wind
had
tossed
and
combed
them
even
while
congealing
and
crossed
with
little
steps
wherever
the
freezing
torrent
lingered
and
here
and
there
the
ice
was
fibred
with
the
trail
of
sludgeweed
slanting
from
the
side
and
matted
so
as
to
make
restingplace
lo
it
was
easy
track
and
channel
as
if
for
the
very
purpose
made
down
which
i
could
guide
my
sledge
with
lorna
sitting
in
it
there
were
only
two
things
to
be
feared
one
lest
the
rolls
of
snow
above
should
fall
in
and
bury
us
the
other
lest
we
should
rush
too
fast
and
so
be
carried
headlong
into
the
black
whirlpool
at
the
bottom
the
middle
of
which
was
still
unfrozen
and
looking
more
horrible
by
the
contrast
against
this
danger
i
made
provision
by
fixing
a
stout
bar
across
but
of
the
other
we
must
take
our
chance
and
trust
ourselves
to
providence
i
hastened
home
at
my
utmost
speed
and
told
my
mother
for
gods
sake
to
keep
the
house
up
till
my
return
and
to
have
plenty
of
fire
blazing
and
plenty
of
water
boiling
and
food
enough
hot
for
a
dozen
people
and
the
best
bed
aired
with
the
warmingpan
dear
mother
smiled
softly
at
my
excitement
though
her
own
was
not
much
less
i
am
sure
and
enhanced
by
sore
anxiety
then
i
gave
very
strict
directions
to
annie
and
praised
her
a
little
and
kissed
her
and
i
even
endeavoured
to
flatter
eliza
lest
she
should
be
disagreeable
after
this
i
took
some
brandy
both
within
and
about
me
the
former
because
i
had
sharp
work
to
do
and
the
latter
in
fear
of
whatever
might
happen
in
such
great
cold
to
my
comrades
also
i
carried
some
other
provisions
grieving
much
at
their
coldness
and
then
i
went
to
the
upper
linhay
and
took
our
new
light
ponysledd
which
had
been
made
almost
as
much
for
pleasure
as
for
business
though
god
only
knows
how
our
girls
could
have
found
any
pleasure
in
bumping
along
so
on
the
snow
however
it
ran
as
sweetly
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
it
yet
i
durst
not
take
the
pony
with
it
in
the
first
place
because
his
hoofs
would
break
through
the
evershifting
surface
of
the
light
and
piling
snow
and
secondly
because
these
ponies
coming
from
the
forest
have
a
dreadful
trick
of
neighing
and
most
of
all
in
frosty
weather
therefore
i
girded
my
own
body
with
a
dozen
turns
of
hayrope
twisting
both
the
ends
in
under
at
the
bottom
of
my
breast
and
winding
the
hay
on
the
skew
a
little
that
the
hempen
thong
might
not
slip
between
and
so
cut
me
in
the
drawing
i
put
a
good
piece
of
spare
rope
in
the
sledd
and
the
crossseat
with
the
back
to
it
which
was
stuffed
with
our
own
wool
as
well
as
two
or
three
fur
coats
and
then
just
as
i
was
starting
out
came
annie
in
spite
of
the
cold
panting
for
fear
of
missing
me
and
with
nothing
on
her
head
but
a
lanthorn
in
one
hand
oh
john
here
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
mother
has
never
shown
it
before
and
i
cant
think
how
she
could
make
up
her
mind
she
had
gotten
it
in
a
great
well
of
a
cupboard
with
camphor
and
spirits
and
lavender
lizzie
says
it
is
a
most
magnificent
sealskin
cloak
worth
fifty
pounds
or
a
farthing
at
any
rate
it
is
soft
and
warm
said
i
very
calmly
flinging
it
into
the
bottom
of
the
sledd
tell
mother
i
will
put
it
over
lornas
feet
lornas
feet
oh
you
great
fool
cried
annie
for
the
first
time
reviling
me
over
her
shoulders
and
be
proud
you
very
stupid
john
it
is
not
good
enough
for
her
feet
i
answered
with
strong
emphasis
but
dont
tell
mother
i
said
so
annie
only
thank
her
very
kindly
with
that
i
drew
my
traces
hard
and
set
my
ashen
staff
into
the
snow
and
struck
out
with
my
best
foot
foremost
the
best
one
at
snowshoes
i
mean
and
the
sledd
came
after
me
as
lightly
as
a
dog
might
follow
and
annie
with
the
lanthorn
seemed
to
be
left
behind
and
waiting
like
a
pretty
lamppost
the
full
moon
rose
as
bright
behind
me
as
a
paten
of
pure
silver
casting
on
the
snow
long
shadows
of
the
few
things
left
above
burdened
rock
and
shaggy
foreland
and
the
labouring
trees
in
the
great
white
desolation
distance
was
a
mocking
vision
hills
looked
nigh
and
valleys
far
when
hills
were
far
and
valleys
nigh
and
the
misty
breath
of
frost
piercing
through
the
ribs
of
rock
striking
to
the
pith
of
trees
creeping
to
the
heart
of
man
lay
along
the
hollow
places
like
a
serpent
sloughing
even
as
my
own
gaunt
shadow
travestied
as
if
i
were
the
moonlights
daddylonglegs
went
before
me
down
the
slope
even
i
the
shadows
master
who
had
tried
in
vain
to
cough
when
coughing
brought
good
liquorice
felt
a
pressure
on
my
bosom
and
a
husking
in
my
throat
however
i
went
on
quietly
and
at
a
very
tidy
speed
being
only
too
thankful
that
the
snow
had
ceased
and
no
wind
as
yet
arisen
and
from
the
ring
of
low
white
vapour
girding
all
the
verge
of
sky
and
from
the
rosy
blue
above
and
the
shafts
of
starlight
set
upon
a
quivering
bow
as
well
as
from
the
moon
itself
and
the
light
behind
it
having
learned
the
signs
of
frost
from
its
bitter
twinges
i
knew
that
we
should
have
a
night
as
keen
as
ever
england
felt
nevertheless
i
had
work
enough
to
keep
me
warm
if
i
managed
it
the
question
was
could
i
contrive
to
save
my
darling
from
it
daring
not
to
risk
my
sledd
by
any
fall
from
the
valleycliffs
i
dragged
it
very
carefully
up
the
steep
incline
of
ice
through
the
narrow
chasm
and
so
to
the
very
brink
and
verge
where
first
i
had
seen
my
lorna
in
the
fishing
days
of
boyhood
as
i
then
had
a
trident
fork
for
sticking
of
the
loaches
so
i
now
had
a
strong
ash
stake
to
lay
across
from
rock
to
rock
and
break
the
speed
of
descending
with
this
i
moored
the
sledd
quite
safe
at
the
very
lip
of
the
chasm
where
all
was
now
substantial
ice
green
and
black
in
the
moonlight
and
then
i
set
off
up
the
valley
skirting
along
one
side
of
it
the
stackfire
still
was
burning
strongly
but
with
more
of
heat
than
blaze
and
many
of
the
younger
doones
were
playing
on
the
verge
of
it
the
children
making
rings
of
fire
and
their
mothers
watching
them
all
the
grave
and
reverend
warriors
having
heard
of
rheumatism
were
inside
of
log
and
stone
in
the
two
lowest
houses
with
enough
of
candles
burning
to
make
our
list
of
sheep
come
short
all
these
i
passed
without
the
smallest
risk
or
difficulty
walking
up
the
channel
of
drift
which
i
spoke
of
once
before
and
then
i
crossed
with
more
of
care
and
to
the
door
of
lornas
house
and
made
the
sign
and
listened
after
taking
my
snowshoes
off
but
no
one
came
as
i
expected
neither
could
i
espy
a
light
and
i
seemed
to
hear
a
faint
low
sound
like
the
moaning
of
the
snowwind
then
i
knocked
again
more
loudly
with
a
knocking
at
my
heart
and
receiving
no
answer
set
all
my
power
at
once
against
the
door
in
a
moment
it
flew
inwards
and
i
glided
along
the
passage
with
my
feet
still
slippery
there
in
lornas
room
i
saw
by
the
moonlight
flowing
in
a
sight
which
drove
me
beyond
sense
lorna
was
behind
a
chair
crouching
in
the
corner
with
her
hands
up
and
a
crucifix
or
something
that
looked
like
it
in
the
middle
of
the
room
lay
gwenny
carfax
stupid
yet
with
one
hand
clutching
the
ankle
of
a
struggling
man
another
man
stood
above
my
lorna
trying
to
draw
the
chair
away
in
a
moment
i
had
him
round
the
waist
and
he
went
out
of
the
window
with
a
mighty
crash
of
glass
luckily
for
him
that
window
had
no
bars
like
some
of
them
then
i
took
the
other
man
by
the
neck
and
he
could
not
plead
for
mercy
i
bore
him
out
of
the
house
as
lightly
as
i
would
bear
a
baby
yet
squeezing
his
throat
a
little
more
than
i
fain
would
do
to
an
infant
by
the
bright
moonlight
i
saw
that
i
carried
marwood
de
whichehalse
for
his
fathers
sake
i
spared
him
and
because
he
had
been
my
schoolfellow
but
with
every
muscle
of
my
body
strung
with
indignation
i
cast
him
like
a
skittle
from
me
into
a
snowdrift
which
closed
over
him
then
i
looked
for
the
other
fellow
tossed
through
lornas
window
and
found
him
lying
stunned
and
bleeding
neither
able
to
groan
yet
charleworth
doone
if
his
gushing
blood
did
not
much
mislead
me
it
was
no
time
to
linger
now
i
fastened
my
shoes
in
a
moment
and
caught
up
my
own
darling
with
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
where
she
whispered
faintly
and
telling
gwenny
to
follow
me
or
else
i
would
come
back
for
her
if
she
could
not
walk
the
snow
i
ran
the
whole
distance
to
my
sledd
caring
not
who
might
follow
me
then
by
the
time
i
had
set
up
lorna
beautiful
and
smiling
with
the
sealskin
cloak
all
over
her
sturdy
gwenny
came
along
having
trudged
in
the
track
of
my
snowshoes
although
with
two
bags
on
her
back
i
set
her
in
beside
her
mistress
to
support
her
and
keep
warm
and
then
with
one
look
back
at
the
glen
which
had
been
so
long
my
home
of
heart
i
hung
behind
the
sledd
and
launched
it
down
the
steep
and
dangerous
way
though
the
cliffs
were
black
above
us
and
the
road
unseen
in
front
and
a
great
white
grave
of
snow
might
at
a
single
word
come
down
lorna
was
as
calm
and
happy
as
an
infant
in
its
bed
she
knew
that
i
was
with
her
and
when
i
told
her
not
to
speak
she
touched
my
hand
in
silence
gwenny
was
in
a
much
greater
fright
having
never
seen
such
a
thing
before
neither
knowing
what
it
is
to
yield
to
pure
loves
confidence
i
could
hardly
keep
her
quiet
without
making
a
noise
myself
with
my
staff
from
rock
to
rock
and
my
weight
thrown
backward
i
broke
the
sledds
too
rapid
way
and
brought
my
grown
love
safely
out
by
the
selfsame
road
which
first
had
led
me
to
her
girlish
fancy
and
my
boyish
slavery
unpursued
yet
looking
back
as
if
some
one
must
be
after
us
we
skirted
round
the
black
whirling
pool
and
gained
the
meadows
beyond
it
here
there
was
hard
collar
work
the
track
being
all
uphill
and
rough
and
gwenny
wanted
to
jump
out
to
lighten
the
sledd
and
to
push
behind
but
i
would
not
hear
of
it
because
it
was
now
so
deadly
cold
and
i
feared
that
lorna
might
get
frozen
without
having
gwenny
to
keep
her
warm
and
after
all
it
was
the
sweetest
labour
i
had
ever
known
in
all
my
life
to
be
sure
that
i
was
pulling
lorna
and
pulling
her
to
our
own
farmhouse
gwennys
nose
was
touched
with
frost
before
we
had
gone
much
farther
because
she
would
not
keep
it
quiet
and
snug
beneath
the
sealskin
and
here
i
had
to
stop
in
the
moonlight
which
was
very
dangerous
and
rub
it
with
a
clove
of
snow
as
eliza
had
taught
me
and
gwenny
scolding
all
the
time
as
if
myself
had
frozen
it
lorna
was
now
so
far
oppressed
with
all
the
troubles
of
the
evening
and
the
joy
that
followed
them
as
well
as
by
the
piercing
cold
and
difficulty
of
breathing
that
she
lay
quite
motionless
like
fairest
wax
in
the
moonlightwhen
we
stole
a
glance
at
her
beneath
the
dark
folds
of
the
cloak
and
i
thought
that
she
was
falling
into
the
heavy
snowsleep
whence
there
is
no
awaking
therefore
i
drew
my
traces
tight
and
set
my
whole
strength
to
the
business
and
we
slipped
along
at
a
merry
pace
although
with
many
joltings
which
must
have
sent
my
darling
out
into
the
cold
snowdrifts
but
for
the
short
strong
arm
of
gwenny
and
so
in
about
an
hours
time
in
spite
of
many
hindrances
we
came
home
to
the
old
courtyard
and
all
the
dogs
saluted
us
my
heart
was
quivering
and
my
cheeks
as
hot
as
the
doones
bonfire
with
wondering
both
what
lorna
would
think
of
our
farmyard
and
what
my
mother
would
think
of
her
upon
the
former
subject
my
anxiety
was
wasted
for
lorna
neither
saw
a
thing
nor
even
opened
her
heavy
eyes
and
as
to
what
mother
would
think
of
her
she
was
certain
not
to
think
at
all
until
she
had
cried
over
her
and
so
indeed
it
came
to
pass
even
at
this
length
of
time
i
can
hardly
tell
it
although
so
bright
before
my
mind
because
it
moves
my
heart
so
the
sledd
was
at
the
open
door
with
only
lorna
in
it
for
gwenny
carfax
had
jumped
out
and
hung
back
in
the
clearing
giving
any
reason
rather
than
the
only

people

betty

teaching
me
how
to
draw
the
sledd
as
if
she
had
been
born
in
it
and
flourishing
with
a
great
broom
wherever
a
speck
of
snow
lay
then
dear
annie
and
old
molly
who
was
very
quiet
and
counted
almost
for
nobody
and
behind
them
mother
looking
as
if
she
wanted
to
come
first
but
doubted
how
the
manners
lay
in
the
distance
lizzie
stood
fearful
of
encouraging
but
unable
to
keep
out
of
it
betty
was
going
to
poke
her
broom
right
in
under
the
sealskin
cloak
where
lorna
lay
unconscious
and
where
her
precious
breath
hung
frozen
like
a
silver
cobweb
but
i
caught
up
bettys
broom
and
flung
it
clean
away
over
the
corn
chamber
and
then
i
put
the
others
by
and
fetched
my
mother
forward
you
shall
see
her
first
i
said
is
she
not
your
daughter
hold
the
light
there
annie
dear
mothers
hands
were
quick
and
trembling
as
she
opened
the
shining
folds
and
there
she
saw
my
lorna
sleeping
with
her
black
hair
all
dishevelled
and
she
bent
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
only
said
god
bless
her
john
and
then
she
was
taken
with
violent
weeping
and
i
was
forced
to
hold
her
us
may
tich
of
her
now
i
rackon
said
betty
in
her
most
jealous
way
annie
tak
her
by
the
head
and
ill
tak
her
by
the
toesen
no
taime

stand
here
like
girt
gawks
donee
tak
on
zo
missus
ther
be
vainer
vish
in
the
zealor
but
her
be
a
booty
with
this
they
carried
her
into
the
house
betty
chattering
all
the
while
and
going
on
now
about
lornas
hands
and
the
others
crowding
round
her
so
that
i
thought
i
was
not
wanted
among
so
many
women
and
should
only
get
the
worst
of
it
and
perhaps
do
harm
to
my
darling
therefore
i
went
and
brought
gwenny
in
and
gave
her
a
potful
of
bacon
and
peas
and
an
iron
spoon
to
eat
it
with
which
she
did
right
heartily
then
i
asked
her
how
she
could
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
let
those
two
vile
fellows
enter
the
house
where
lorna
was
and
she
accounted
for
it
so
naturally
that
i
could
only
blame
myself
for
my
agreement
had
been
to
give
one
loud
knock
if
you
happen
to
remember
and
after
that
two
little
knocks
well
these
two
drunken
rogues
had
come
and
one
being
very
drunk
indeed
had
given
a
great
thump
and
then
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
and
the
other
being
threequarters
drunk
had
followed
his
leader
as
one
might
say
but
feebly
and
making
two
of
it
whereupon
up
jumped
lorna
and
declared
that
her
john
was
there
all
this
gwenny
told
me
shortly
between
the
whiles
of
eating
and
even
while
she
licked
the
spoon
and
then
there
came
a
message
for
me
that
my
love
was
sensible
and
was
seeking
all
around
for
me
then
i
told
gwenny
to
hold
her
tongue
whatever
she
did
among
us
and
not
to
trust
to
womens
words
and
she
told
me
they
all
were
liars
as
she
had
found
out
long
ago
and
the
only
thing
to
believe
in
was
an
honest
man
when
found
thereupon
i
could
have
kissed
her
as
a
sort
of
tribute
liking
to
be
appreciated
yet
the
peas
upon
her
lips
made
me
think
about
it
and
thought
is
fatal
to
action
so
i
went
to
see
my
dear
that
sight
i
shall
not
forget
till
my
dying
head
falls
back
and
my
breast
can
lift
no
more
i
know
not
whether
i
were
then
more
blessed
or
harrowed
by
it
for
in
the
settle
was
my
lorna
propped
with
pillows
round
her
and
her
clear
hands
spread
sometimes
to
the
blazing
fireplace
in
her
eyes
no
knowledge
was
of
anything
around
her
neither
in
her
neck
the
sense
of
leaning
towards
anything
only
both
her
lovely
hands
were
entreating
something
to
spare
her
or
to
love
her
and
the
lines
of
supplication
quivered
in
her
sad
white
face
all
go
away
except
my
mother
i
said
very
quietly
but
so
that
i
would
be
obeyed
and
everybody
knew
it
then
mother
came
to
me
alone
and
she
said
the
frost
is
in
her
brain
i
have
heard
of
this
before
john
mother
i
will
have
it
out
was
all
that
i
could
answer
her
leave
her
to
me
altogether
only
you
sit
there
and
watch
for
i
felt
that
lorna
knew
me
and
no
other
soul
but
me
and
that
if
not
interfered
with
she
would
soon
come
home
to
me
therefore
i
sat
gently
by
her
leaving
nature
as
it
were
to
her
own
good
time
and
will
and
presently
the
glance
that
watched
me
as
at
distance
and
in
doubt
began
to
flutter
and
to
brighten
and
to
deepen
into
kindness
then
to
beam
with
trust
and
love
and
then
with
gathering
tears
to
falter
and
in
shame
to
turn
away
but
the
small
entreating
hands
found
their
way
as
if
by
instinct
to
my
great
projecting
palms
and
trembled
there
and
rested
there
for
a
little
while
we
lingered
thus
neither
wishing
to
move
away
neither
caring
to
look
beyond
the
presence
of
the
other
both
alike
so
full
of
hope
and
comfort
and
true
happiness
if
only
the
world
would
let
us
be
and
then
a
little
sob
disturbed
us
and
mother
tried
to
make
believe
that
she
was
only
coughing
but
lorna
guessing
who
she
was
jumped
up
so
very
rashly
that
she
almost
set
her
frock
on
fire
from
the
great
ash
log
and
away
she
ran
to
the
old
oak
chair
where
mother
was
by
the
clockcase
pretending
to
be
knitting
and
she
took
the
work
from
mothers
hands
and
laid
them
both
upon
her
head
kneeling
humbly
and
looking
up
god
bless
you
my
fair
mistress
said
mother
bending
nearer
and
then
as
lornas
gaze
prevailed
god
bless
you
my
sweet
child
and
so
she
went
to
mothers
heart
by
the
very
nearest
road
even
as
she
had
come
to
mine
i
mean
the
road
of
pity
smoothed
by
grace
and
youth
and
gentleness

a
change
long
needed
jeremy
stickles
was
gone
south
ere
ever
the
frost
set
in
for
the
purpose
of
mustering
forces
to
attack
the
doone
glen
but
of
course
this
weather
had
put
a
stop
to
every
kind
of
movement
for
even
if
men
could
have
borne
the
cold
they
could
scarcely
be
brought
to
face
the
perils
of
the
snowdrifts
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
cared
not
how
long
this
weather
lasted
so
long
as
we
had
enough
to
eat
and
could
keep
ourselves
from
freezing
not
only
that
i
did
not
want
master
stickles
back
again
to
make
more
disturbances
but
also
that
the
doones
could
not
come
prowling
after
lorna
while
the
snow
lay
piled
between
us
with
the
surface
soft
and
dry
of
course
they
would
very
soon
discover
where
their
lawful
queen
was
although
the
track
of
sledd
and
snowshoes
had
been
quite
obliterated
by
another
shower
before
the
revellers
could
have
grown
half
as
drunk
as
they
intended
but
marwood
de
whichehalse
who
had
been
snowed
up
among
them
as
gwenny
said
after
helping
to
strip
the
beacon
that
young
squire
was
almost
certain
to
have
recognised
me
and
to
have
told
the
vile
carver
and
it
gave
me
no
little
pleasure
to
think
how
mad
that
carver
must
be
with
me
for
robbing
him
of
the
lovely
bride
whom
he
was
starving
into
matrimony
however
i
was
not
pleased
at
all
with
the
prospect
of
the
consequences
but
set
all
hands
on
to
thresh
the
corn
ere
the
doones
could
come
and
burn
the
ricks
for
i
knew
that
they
could
not
come
yet
inasmuch
as
even
a
forest
pony
could
not
traverse
the
country
much
less
the
heavy
horses
needed
to
carry
such
men
as
they
were
and
hundreds
of
the
forest
ponies
died
in
this
hard
weather
some
being
buried
in
the
snow
and
more
of
them
starved
for
want
of
grass
going
through
this
state
of
things
and
laying
down
the
law
about
it
subject
to
correction
i
very
soon
persuaded
lorna
that
for
the
present
she
was
safe
and
which
made
her
still
more
happy
that
she
was
not
only
welcome
but
as
gladdening
to
our
eyes
as
the
flowers
of
may
of
course
so
far
as
regarded
myself
this
was
not
a
hundredth
part
of
the
real
truth
and
even
as
regarded
others
i
might
have
said
it
ten
times
over
for
lorna
had
so
won
them
all
by
her
kind
and
gentle
ways
and
her
mode
of
hearkening
to
everybodys
trouble
and
replying
without
words
as
well
as
by
her
beauty
and
simple
grace
of
all
things
that
i
could
almost
wish
sometimes
the
rest
would
leave
her
more
to
me
but
mother
could
not
do
enough
and
annie
almost
worshipped
her
and
even
lizzie
could
not
keep
her
bitterness
towards
her
especially
when
she
found
that
lorna
knew
as
much
of
books
as
need
be
as
for
john
fry
and
betty
and
molly
they
were
a
perfect
plague
when
lorna
came
into
the
kitchen
for
betwixt
their
curiosity
to
see
a
live
doone
in
the
flesh
when
certain
not
to
eat
them
and
their
high
respect
for
birth
with
or
without
honesty
and
their
intense
desire
to
know
all
about
master
johns
sweetheart
dropped
as
they
said
from
the
snowclouds
and
most
of
all
their
admiration
of
a
beauty
such
as
never
even
their
angels
could
have
seenbetwixt
and
between
all
this
i
say
there
was
no
getting
the
dinner
cooked
with
lorna
in
the
kitchen
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
lorna
took
the
strangest
of
all
strange
fancies
for
this
very
kitchen
and
it
was
hard
to
keep
her
out
of
it
not
that
she
had
any
special
bent
for
cooking
as
our
annie
had
rather
indeed
the
contrary
for
she
liked
to
have
her
food
ready
cooked
but
that
she
loved
the
look
of
the
place
and
the
cheerful
fire
burning
and
the
racks
of
bacon
to
be
seen
and
the
richness
and
the
homeliness
and
the
pleasant
smell
of
everything
and
who
knows
but
what
she
may
have
liked
as
the
very
best
of
maidens
do
to
be
admired
now
and
then
between
the
times
of
business
therefore
if
you
wanted
lorna
as
i
was
always
sure
to
do
god
knows
how
many
times
a
day
the
very
surest
place
to
find
her
was
our
own
old
kitchen
not
gossiping
i
mean
nor
loitering
neither
seeking
into
things
but
seeming
to
be
quite
at
home
as
if
she
had
known
it
from
a
child
and
seeming
to
my
eyes
at
least
to
light
it
up
and
make
life
and
colour
out
of
all
the
dullness
as
i
have
seen
the
breaking
sun
do
among
brown
shocks
of
wheat
but
any
one
who
wished
to
learn
whether
girls
can
change
or
not
as
the
things
around
them
change
while
yet
their
hearts
are
steadfast
and
for
ever
anchored
he
should
just
have
seen
my
lorna
after
a
fortnight
of
our
life
and
freedom
from
anxiety
it
is
possible
that
my
companyalthough
i
am
accounted
stupid
by
folk
who
do
not
know
my
waymay
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
upon
this
i
will
not
say
much
lest
i
lose
my
character
and
indeed
as
regards
company
i
had
all
the
threshing
to
see
to
and
more
than
half
to
do
myself
though
any
one
would
have
thought
that
even
john
fry
must
work
hard
this
weather
else
i
could
not
hope
at
all
to
get
our
corn
into
such
compass
that
a
good
gun
might
protect
it
but
to
come
back
to
lorna
again
which
i
always
longed
to
do
and
must
long
for
ever
all
the
change
between
night
and
day
all
the
shifts
of
cloud
and
sun
all
the
difference
between
black
death
and
brightsome
liveliness
scarcely
may
suggest
or
equal
lornas
transformation
quick
she
had
always
been
and
peart
as
we
say
on
exmoor
and
gifted
with
a
leap
of
thought
too
swift
for
me
to
follow
and
hence
you
may
find
fault
with
much
when
i
report
her
sayings
but
through
the
whole
had
always
run
as
a
black
string
goes
through
pearls
something
dark
and
touched
with
shadow
coloured
as
with
an
early
end
but
now
behold
there
was
none
of
this
there
was
no
getting
her
for
a
moment
even
to
be
serious
all
her
bright
young
wit
was
flashing
like
a
newlyawakened
flame
and
all
her
high
young
spirits
leaped
as
if
dancing
to
its
fire
and
yet
she
never
spoke
a
word
which
gave
more
pain
than
pleasure
and
even
in
her
outward
look
there
was
much
of
difference
whether
it
was
our
warmth
and
freedom
and
our
harmless
love
of
god
and
trust
in
one
another
or
whether
it
were
our
air
and
water
and
the
peafed
bacon
anyhow
my
lorna
grew
richer
and
more
lovely
more
perfect
and
more
firm
of
figure
and
more
light
and
buoyant
with
every
passing
day
that
laid
its
tribute
on
her
cheeks
and
lips
i
was
allowed
one
kiss
a
day
only
one
for
manners
sake
because
she
was
our
visitor
and
i
might
have
it
before
breakfast
or
else
when
i
came
to
say
goodnight
according
as
i
decided
and
i
decided
every
night
not
to
take
it
in
the
morning
but
put
it
off
till
the
evening
time
and
have
the
pleasure
to
think
about
through
all
the
day
of
working
but
when
my
darling
came
up
to
me
in
the
early
daylight
fresher
than
the
daystar
and
with
no
one
looking
only
her
bright
eyes
smiling
and
sweet
lips
quite
ready
was
it
likely
i
could
wait
and
think
all
day
about
it
for
she
wore
a
frock
of
annies
nicely
made
to
fit
her
taken
in
at
the
waist
and
curvedi
never
could
explain
it
not
being
a
mantuamaker
but
i
know
how
her
figure
looked
in
it
and
how
it
came
towards
me
but
this
is
neither
here
nor
there
and
i
must
on
with
my
story
those
days
are
very
sacred
to
me
and
if
i
speak
lightly
of
them
trust
me
tis
with
lip
alone
while
from
heart
reproach
peeps
sadly
at
the
flippant
tricks
of
mind
although
it
was
the
longest
winter
ever
known
in
our
parts
never
having
ceased
to
freeze
for
a
single
night
and
scarcely
for
a
single
day
from
the
middle
of
december
till
the
second
week
in
march
to
me
it
was
the
very
shortest
and
the
most
delicious
and
verily
i
do
believe
it
was
the
same
to
lorna
but
when
the
ides
of
march
were
come
of
which
i
do
remember
something
dim
from
school
and
something
clear
from
my
favourite
writer
lo
there
were
increasing
signals
of
a
change
of
weather
one
leading
feature
of
that
long
cold
and
a
thing
remarked
by
every
one
however
unobservant
had
been
the
hollow
moaning
sound
ever
present
in
the
air
morning
noon
and
nighttime
and
especially
at
night
whether
any
wind
were
stirring
or
whether
it
were
a
perfect
calm
our
people
said
that
it
was
a
witch
cursing
all
the
country
from
the
caverns
by
the
sea
and
that
frost
and
snow
would
last
until
we
could
catch
and
drown
her
but
the
land
being
thoroughly
blocked
with
snow
and
the
inshore
parts
of
the
sea
with
ice
floating
in
great
fields
along
mother
melldrum
if
she
it
were
had
the
caverns
all
to
herself
for
there
was
no
getting
at
her
and
speaking
of
the
sea
reminds
me
of
a
thing
reported
to
us
and
on
good
authority
though
people
might
be
found
hereafter
who
would
not
believe
it
unless
i
told
them
that
from
what
i
myself
beheld
of
the
channel
i
place
perfect
faith
in
it
and
this
is
that
a
dozen
sailors
at
the
beginning
of
march
crossed
the
ice
with
the
aid
of
poles
from
clevedon
to
penarth
or
where
the
holm
rocks
barred
the
flotage
but
now
about
the
tenth
of
march
that
miserable
moaning
noise
which
had
both
foregone
and
accompanied
the
rigour
died
away
from
out
the
air
and
we
being
now
so
used
to
it
thought
at
first
that
we
must
be
deaf
and
then
the
fog
which
had
hung
about
even
in
full
sunshine
vanished
and
the
shrouded
hills
shone
forth
with
brightness
manifold
and
now
the
sky
at
length
began
to
come
to
its
true
manner
which
we
had
not
seen
for
months
a
mixture
if
i
so
may
speak
of
various
expressions
whereas
till
now
from
allhallowstide
six
weeks
ere
the
great
frost
set
in
the
heavens
had
worn
one
heavy
mask
of
ashen
gray
when
clouded
or
else
one
amethystine
tinge
with
a
hazy
rim
when
cloudless
so
it
was
pleasant
to
behold
after
that
monotony
the
fickle
sky
which
suits
our
england
though
abused
by
foreign
folk
and
soon
the
dappled
softening
sky
gave
some
earnest
of
its
mood
for
a
brisk
south
wind
arose
and
the
blessed
rain
came
driving
cold
indeed
yet
most
refreshing
to
the
skin
all
parched
with
snow
and
the
eyeballs
so
long
dazzled
neither
was
the
heart
more
sluggish
in
its
thankfulness
to
god
people
had
begun
to
think
and
somebody
had
prophesied
that
we
should
have
no
spring
this
year
no
seedtime
and
no
harvest
for
that
the
lord
had
sent
a
judgment
on
this
country
of
england
and
the
nation
dwelling
in
it
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
court
and
the
encouragement
shown
to
papists
and
this
was
proved
they
said
by
what
had
happened
in
the
town
of
london
where
for
more
than
a
fortnight
such
a
chill
of
darkness
lay
that
no
man
might
behold
his
neighbour
even
across
the
narrowest
street
and
where
the
ice
upon
the
thames
was
more
than
four
feet
thick
and
crushing
london
bridge
in
twain
now
to
these
prophets
i
paid
no
heed
believing
not
that
providence
would
freeze
us
for
other
peoples
sins
neither
seeing
how
england
could
for
many
generations
have
enjoyed
good
sunshine
if
popery
meant
frost
and
fogs
besides
why
could
not
providence
settle
the
business
once
for
all
by
freezing
the
pope
himself
even
though
according
to
our
view
he
were
destined
to
extremes
of
heat
together
with
all
who
followed
him
not
to
meddle
with
that
subject
being
beyond
my
judgment
let
me
tell
the
things
i
saw
and
then
you
must
believe
me
the
wind
of
course
i
could
not
see
not
having
the
powers
of
a
pig
but
i
could
see
the
laden
branches
of
the
great
oaks
moving
hoping
to
shake
off
the
load
packed
and
saddled
on
them
and
hereby
i
may
note
a
thing
which
some
one
may
explain
perhaps
in
the
after
ages
when
people
come
to
look
at
things
this
is
that
in
desperate
cold
all
the
trees
were
pulled
awry
even
though
the
wind
had
scattered
the
snow
burden
from
them
of
some
sorts
the
branches
bended
downwards
like
an
archway
of
other
sorts
the
boughs
curved
upwards
like
a
red
deers
frontlet
this
i
know
no
reason
for
but
am
ready
to
swear
that
i
saw
it

the
reason
is
very
simple
as
all
natures
reasons
are
though
the
subject
has
not
yet
been
investigated
thoroughly
in
some
trees
the
vascular
tissue
is
more
open
on
the
upper
side
in
others
on
the
under
side
of
the
spreading
branches
according
to
the
form
of
growth
and
habit
of
the
sap
hence
in
very
severe
cold
when
the
vessels
comparatively
empty
are
constricted
some
have
more
power
of
contraction
on
the
upper
side
and
some
upon
the
under
now
when
the
first
of
the
rain
began
and
the
old
familiar
softness
spread
upon
the
window
glass
and
ran
a
little
way
in
channels
though
from
the
coldness
of
the
glass
it
froze
before
reaching
the
bottom
knowing
at
once
the
difference
from
the
short
sharp
thud
of
snow
we
all
ran
out
and
filled
our
eyes
and
filled
our
hearts
with
gazing
true
the
snow
was
piled
up
now
all
in
mountains
round
us
true
the
air
was
still
so
cold
that
our
breath
froze
on
the
doorway
and
the
rain
was
turned
to
ice
wherever
it
struck
anything
nevertheless
that
it
was
rain
there
was
no
denying
as
we
watched
it
across
black
doorways
and
could
see
no
sign
of
white
mother
who
had
made
up
her
mind
that
the
farm
was
not
worth
having
after
all
those
prophesies
and
that
all
of
us
must
starve
and
holes
be
scratched
in
the
snow
for
us
and
no
use
to
put
up
a
tombstone
for
our
church
had
been
shut
up
long
ago
mother
fell
upon
my
breast
and
sobbed
that
i
was
the
cleverest
fellow
ever
born
of
woman
and
this
because
i
had
condemned
the
prophets
for
a
pack
of
fools
not
seeing
how
business
could
go
on
if
people
stopped
to
hearken
to
them
then
lorna
came
and
glorified
me
for
i
had
predicted
a
change
of
weather
more
to
keep
their
spirits
up
than
with
real
hope
of
it
and
then
came
annie
blushing
shyly
as
i
looked
at
her
and
said
that
winnie
would
soon
have
four
legs
now
this
referred
to
some
stupid
joke
made
by
john
fry
or
somebody
that
in
this
weather
a
man
had
no
legs
and
a
horse
had
only
two
but
as
the
rain
came
down
upon
us
from
the
southwest
wind
and
we
could
not
have
enough
of
it
even
putting
our
tongues
to
catch
it
as
little
children
might
do
and
beginning
to
talk
of
primroses
the
very
noblest
thing
of
all
was
to
hear
and
see
the
gratitude
of
the
poor
beasts
yet
remaining
and
the
few
surviving
birds
from
the
cowhouse
lowing
came
more
than
of
fifty
milking
times
moo
and
moo
and
a
turnup
noise
at
the
end
of
every
bellow
as
if
from
the
very
heart
of
kine
then
the
horses
in
the
stables
packed
as
closely
as
they
could
stick
at
the
risk
of
kicking
to
keep
the
warmth
in
one
another
and
their
spirits
up
by
discoursing
these
began
with
one
accord
to
lift
up
their
voices
snorting
snaffling
whinnying
and
neighing
and
trotting
to
the
door
to
know
when
they
should
have
work
again
to
whom
as
if
in
answer
came
the
feeble
bleating
of
the
sheep
what
few
by
dint
of
greatest
care
had
kept
their
fleeces
on
their
backs
and
their
four
legs
under
them
neither
was
it
a
trifling
thing
let
whoso
will
say
the
contrary
to
behold
the
ducks
and
geese
marching
forth
in
handsome
order
from
their
beds
of
fern
and
straw
what
a
goodly
noise
they
kept
what
a
flapping
of
their
wings
and
a
jerking
of
their
tails
as
they
stood
right
up
and
tried
with
a
whistling
in
their
throats
to
imitate
a
cockscrow
and
then
how
daintily
they
took
the
wet
upon
their
dusty
plumes
and
ducked
their
shoulders
to
it
and
began
to
dress
themselves
and
laid
their
grooved
bills
on
the
snow
and
dabbled
for
more
ooziness
lorna
had
never
seen
i
dare
say
anything
like
this
before
and
it
was
all
that
we
could
do
to
keep
her
from
rushing
forth
with
only
little
lambswool
shoes
on
and
kissing
every
one
of
them
oh
the
dear
things
oh
the
dear
things
she
kept
saying
continually
how
wonderfully
clever
they
are
only
look
at
that
one
with
his
foot
up
giving
orders
to
the
others
john
and
i
must
give
orders
to
you
my
darling
i
answered
gazing
on
her
face
so
brilliant
with
excitement
and
that
is
that
you
come
in
at
once
with
that
worrisome
cough
of
yours
and
sit
by
the
fire
and
warm
yourself
oh
no
john
not
for
a
minute
if
you
please
good
john
i
want
to
see
the
snow
go
away
and
the
green
meadows
coming
forth
and
here
comes
our
favourite
robin
who
has
lived
in
the
oven
so
long
and
sang
us
a
song
every
morning
i
must
see
what
he
thinks
of
it
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
answered
very
shortly
being
only
too
glad
of
a
cause
for
having
her
in
my
arms
again
so
i
caught
her
up
and
carried
her
in
and
she
looked
and
smiled
so
sweetly
at
me
instead
of
pouting
as
i
had
feared
that
i
found
myself
unable
to
go
very
fast
along
the
passage
and
i
set
her
there
in
her
favourite
place
by
the
sweetscented
woodfire
and
she
paid
me
porterage
without
my
even
asking
her
and
for
all
the
beauty
of
the
rain
i
was
fain
to
stay
with
her
until
our
annie
came
to
say
that
my
advice
was
wanted
now
my
advice
was
never
much
as
everybody
knew
quite
well
but
that
was
the
way
they
always
put
it
when
they
wanted
me
to
work
for
them
and
in
truth
it
was
time
for
me
to
work
not
for
others
but
myself
and
as
i
always
thought
for
lorna
for
the
rain
was
now
coming
down
in
earnest
and
the
top
of
the
snow
being
frozen
at
last
and
glazed
as
hard
as
a
china
cup
by
means
of
the
sun
and
frost
afterwards
all
the
rain
ran
right
away
from
the
steep
inclines
and
all
the
outlets
being
blocked
with
ice
set
up
like
tables
it
threatened
to
flood
everything
already
it
was
ponding
up
like
a
tide
advancing
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
from
which
we
had
watched
the
duckbirds
both
because
great
piles
of
snow
trended
in
that
direction
in
spite
of
all
our
scraping
and
also
that
the
gulley
hole
where
the
water
of
the
shoot
went
out
i
mean
when
it
was
water
now
was
choked
with
lumps
of
ice
as
big
as
a
mans
body
for
the
shoot
as
we
called
our
little
runnel
of
everlasting
water
never
known
to
freeze
before
and
always
ready
for
any
man
either
to
wash
his
hands
or
drink
where
it
spouted
from
a
trough
of
bark
set
among
white
flintstones
this
at
last
had
given
in
and
its
music
ceased
to
lull
us
as
we
lay
in
bed
it
was
not
long
before
i
managed
to
drain
off
this
threatening
flood
by
opening
the
old
sluicehole
but
i
had
much
harder
work
to
keep
the
stables
and
the
cowhouse
and
the
other
sheds
from
flooding
for
we
have
a
sapient
practice
and
i
never
saw
the
contrary
round
about
our
parts
i
mean
of
keeping
all
rooms
underground
so
that
you
step
down
to
them
we
say
that
thus
we
keep
them
warmer
both
for
cattle
and
for
men
in
the
time
of
winter
and
cooler
in
the
summertime
this
i
will
not
contradict
though
having
my
own
opinion
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
relic
of
the
time
when
people
in
the
western
countries
lived
in
caves
beneath
the
ground
and
blocked
the
mouths
with
neatskins
let
that
question
still
abide
for
men
who
study
ancient
times
to
inform
me
if
they
will
all
i
know
is
that
now
we
had
no
blessings
for
the
system
if
after
all
their
cold
and
starving
our
weak
cattle
now
should
have
to
stand
up
to
their
knees
in
water
it
would
be
certain
death
to
them
and
we
had
lost
enough
already
to
make
us
poor
for
a
long
time
not
to
speak
of
our
kind
love
for
them
and
i
do
assure
you
i
loved
some
horses
and
even
some
cows
for
that
matter
as
if
they
had
been
my
bloodrelations
knowing
as
i
did
their
virtues
and
some
of
these
were
lost
to
us
and
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
them
therefore
i
worked
hard
all
night
to
try
and
save
the
rest
of
them
chapter
xlvi
squire
faggus
makes
some
lucky
hits
through
that
season
of
bitter
frost
the
red
deer
of
the
forest
having
nothing
to
feed
upon
and
no
shelter
to
rest
in
had
grown
accustomed
to
our
ricks
of
corn
and
hay
and
clover
there
we
might
see
a
hundred
of
them
almost
any
morning
come
for
warmth
and
food
and
comfort
and
scarce
willing
to
move
away
and
many
of
them
were
so
tame
that
they
quietly
presented
themselves
at
our
back
door
and
stood
there
with
their
coats
quite
stiff
and
their
flanks
drawn
in
and
panting
and
icicles
sometimes
on
their
chins
and
their
great
eyes
fastened
wistfully
upon
any
merciful
person
craving
for
a
bit
of
food
and
a
drink
of
water
i
suppose
that
they
had
not
sense
enough
to
chew
the
snow
and
melt
it
at
any
rate
all
the
springs
being
frozen
and
rivers
hidden
out
of
sight
these
poor
things
suffered
even
more
from
thirst
than
they
did
from
hunger
but
now
there
was
no
fear
of
thirst
and
more
chance
indeed
of
drowning
for
a
heavy
gale
of
wind
arose
with
violent
rain
from
the
southwest
which
lasted
almost
without
a
pause
for
three
nights
and
two
days
at
first
the
rain
made
no
impression
on
the
bulk
of
snow
but
ran
from
every
sloping
surface
and
froze
on
every
flat
one
through
the
coldness
of
the
earth
and
so
it
became
impossible
for
any
man
to
keep
his
legs
without
the
help
of
a
shodden
staff
after
a
good
while
however
the
air
growing
very
much
warmer
this
state
of
things
began
to
change
and
a
worse
one
to
succeed
it
for
now
the
snow
came
thundering
down
from
roof
and
rock
and
ivied
tree
and
floods
began
to
roar
and
foam
in
every
trough
and
gulley
the
drifts
that
had
been
so
white
and
fair
looked
yellow
and
smirched
and
muddy
and
lost
their
graceful
curves
and
moulded
lines
and
airiness
but
the
strangest
sight
of
all
to
me
was
in
the
bed
of
streams
and
brooks
and
especially
of
the
lynn
river
it
was
worth
going
miles
to
behold
such
a
thing
for
a
man
might
never
have
the
chance
again
vast
drifts
of
snow
had
filled
the
valley
and
piled
above
the
rivercourse
fifty
feet
high
in
many
places
and
in
some
as
much
as
a
hundred
these
had
frozen
over
the
top
and
glanced
the
rain
away
from
them
and
being
sustained
by
rock
and
tree
spanned
the
water
mightily
but
meanwhile
the
waxing
flood
swollen
from
every
moorland
hollow
and
from
every
spouting
crag
had
dashed
away
all
icy
fetters
and
was
rolling
gloriously
under
white
fantastic
arches
and
long
tunnels
freaked
and
fretted
and
between
pellucid
pillars
jagged
with
nodding
architraves
the
red
impetuous
torrent
rushed
and
the
brown
foam
whirled
and
flashed
i
was
half
inclined
to
jump
in
and
swim
through
such
glorious
scenery
for
nothing
used
to
please
me
more
than
swimming
in
a
flooded
river
but
i
thought
of
the
rocks
and
i
thought
of
the
cramp
and
more
than
all
of
lorna
and
so
between
one
thing
and
another
i
let
it
roll
on
without
me
it
was
now
high
time
to
work
very
hard
both
to
make
up
for
the
farmwork
lost
during
the
months
of
frost
and
snow
and
also
to
be
ready
for
a
great
and
vicious
attack
from
the
doones
who
would
burn
us
in
our
beds
at
the
earliest
opportunity
of
farmwork
there
was
little
yet
for
even
the
most
zealous
man
to
begin
to
lay
his
hand
to
because
when
the
ground
appeared
through
the
crust
of
bubbled
snow
as
at
last
it
did
though
not
as
my
lorna
had
expected
at
the
first
few
drops
of
rain
it
was
all
so
soaked
and
sodden
and
as
we
call
it
mucksy
that
to
meddle
with
it
in
any
way
was
to
do
more
harm
than
good
nevertheless
there
was
yard
work
and
house
work
and
tendence
of
stock
enough
to
save
any
man
from
idleness
as
for
lorna
she
would
come
out
there
was
no
keeping
her
in
the
house
she
had
taken
up
some
peculiar
notion
that
we
were
doing
more
for
her
than
she
had
any
right
to
and
that
she
must
earn
her
living
by
the
hard
work
of
her
hands
it
was
quite
in
vain
to
tell
her
that
she
was
expected
to
do
nothing
and
far
worse
than
vain
for
it
made
her
cry
sadly
if
any
one
assured
her
that
she
could
do
no
good
at
all
she
even
began
upon
mothers
garden
before
the
snow
was
clean
gone
from
it
and
sowed
a
beautiful
row
of
peas
every
one
of
which
the
mice
ate
but
though
it
was
very
pretty
to
watch
her
working
for
her
very
life
as
if
the
maintenance
of
the
household
hung
upon
her
labours
yet
i
was
grieved
for
many
reasons
and
so
was
mother
also
in
the
first
place
she
was
too
fair
and
dainty
for
this
rough
rude
work
and
though
it
made
her
cheeks
so
bright
it
surely
must
be
bad
for
her
to
get
her
little
feet
so
wet
moreover
we
could
not
bear
the
idea
that
she
should
labour
for
her
keep
and
again
which
was
the
worst
of
all
things
mothers
garden
lay
exposed
to
a
dark
deceitful
coppice
where
a
man
might
lurk
and
watch
all
the
fair
gardeners
doings
it
was
true
that
none
could
get
at
her
thence
while
the
brook
which
ran
between
poured
so
great
a
torrent
still
the
distance
was
but
little
for
a
gun
to
carry
if
any
one
could
be
brutal
enough
to
point
a
gun
at
lorna
i
thought
that
none
could
be
found
to
do
it
but
mother
having
more
experience
was
not
so
certain
of
mankind
now
in
spite
of
the
floods
and
the
sloughs
being
out
and
the
state
of
the
roads
most
perilous
squire
faggus
came
at
last
riding
his
famous
strawberry
mare
there
was
a
great
ado
between
him
and
annie
as
you
may
well
suppose
after
some
four
months
of
parting
and
so
we
left
them
alone
awhile
to
coddle
over
their
raptures
but
when
they
were
tired
of
that
or
at
least
had
time
enough
to
do
so
mother
and
i
went
in
to
know
what
news
tom
had
brought
with
him
though
he
did
not
seem
to
want
us
yet
he
made
himself
agreeable
and
so
we
sent
annie
to
cook
the
dinner
while
her
sweetheart
should
tell
us
everything
tom
faggus
had
very
good
news
to
tell
and
he
told
it
with
such
force
of
expression
as
made
us
laugh
very
heartily
he
had
taken
up
his
purchase
from
old
sir
roger
bassett
of
a
nice
bit
of
land
to
the
south
of
the
moors
and
in
the
parish
of
molland
when
the
lawyers
knew
thoroughly
who
he
was
and
how
he
had
made
his
money
they
behaved
uncommonly
well
to
him
and
showed
great
sympathy
with
his
pursuits
he
put
them
up
to
a
thing
or
two
and
they
poked
him
in
the
ribs
and
laughed
and
said
that
he
was
quite
a
boy
but
of
the
right
sort
none
the
less
and
so
they
made
old
squire
bassett
pay
the
bill
for
both
sides
and
all
he
got
for
three
hundred
acres
was
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
though
tom
had
paid
five
hundred
but
lawyers
know
that
this
must
be
so
in
spite
of
all
their
endeavours
and
the
old
gentleman
who
now
expected
to
find
a
bill
for
him
to
pay
almost
thought
himself
a
rogue
for
getting
anything
out
of
them
it
is
true
that
the
land
was
poor
and
wild
and
the
soil
exceeding
shallow
lying
on
the
slope
of
rock
and
burned
up
in
hot
summers
but
with
us
hot
summers
are
things
known
by
tradition
only
as
this
great
winter
may
be
we
generally
have
more
moisture
especially
in
july
than
we
well
know
what
to
do
with
i
have
known
a
fog
for
a
fortnight
at
the
summer
solstice
and
farmers
talking
in
church
about
it
when
they
ought
to
be
praying
but
it
always
contrives
to
come
right
in
the
end
as
other
visitations
do
if
we
take
them
as
true
visits
and
receive
them
kindly
now
this
farm
of
squire
faggus
as
he
truly
now
had
a
right
to
be
called
was
of
the
very
finest
pasture
when
it
got
good
store
of
rain
and
tom
who
had
ridden
the
devonshire
roads
with
many
a
reeking
jacket
knew
right
well
that
he
might
trust
the
climate
for
that
matter
the
herbage
was
of
the
very
sweetest
and
the
shortest
and
the
closest
having
perhaps
from
ten
to
eighteen
inches
of
wholesome
soil
between
it
and
the
solid
rock
tom
saw
at
once
what
it
was
fit
forthe
breeding
of
fine
cattle
being
such
a
hand
as
he
was
at
making
the
most
of
everything
both
his
own
and
other
peoples
although
so
free
in
scattering
when
the
humour
lay
upon
him
he
had
actually
turned
to
his
own
advantage
that
extraordinary
weather
which
had
so
impoverished
every
one
around
him
for
he
taught
his
winnie
who
knew
his
meaning
as
well
as
any
child
could
and
obeyed
not
only
his
word
of
mouth
but
every
glance
he
gave
her
to
go
forth
in
the
snowy
evenings
when
horses
are
seeking
everywhere
be
they
wild
or
tame
for
fodder
and
for
shelter
and
to
whinny
to
the
forest
ponies
miles
away
from
home
perhaps
and
lead
them
all
with
rare
appetites
and
promise
of
abundance
to
her
masters
homestead
he
shod
good
winnie
in
such
a
manner
that
she
could
not
sink
in
the
snow
and
he
clad
her
over
the
loins
with
a
sheepskin
dyed
to
her
own
colour
which
the
wild
horses
were
never
tired
of
coming
up
and
sniffing
at
taking
it
for
an
especial
gift
and
proof
of
inspiration
and
winnie
never
came
home
at
night
without
at
least
a
score
of
ponies
trotting
shyly
after
her
tossing
their
heads
and
their
tails
in
turn
and
making
believe
to
be
very
wild
although
hard
pinched
by
famine
of
course
tom
would
get
them
all
into
his
pound
in
about
five
minutes
for
he
himself
could
neigh
in
a
manner
which
went
to
the
heart
of
the
wildest
horse
and
then
he
fed
them
well
and
turned
them
into
his
great
cattle
pen
to
abide
their
time
for
breaking
when
the
snow
and
frost
should
be
over
he
had
gotten
more
than
three
hundred
now
in
this
sagacious
manner
and
he
said
it
was
the
finest
sight
to
see
their
mode
of
carrying
on
how
they
would
snort
and
stamp
and
fume
and
prick
their
ears
and
rush
backwards
and
lash
themselves
with
their
long
rough
tails
and
shake
their
jagged
manes
and
scream
and
fall
upon
one
another
if
a
strange
man
came
anigh
them
but
as
for
feeding
time
tom
said
it
was
better
than
fifty
plays
to
watch
them
and
the
tricks
they
were
up
to
to
cheat
their
feeders
and
one
another
i
asked
him
how
on
earth
he
had
managed
to
get
fodder
in
such
impassable
weather
for
such
a
herd
of
horses
but
he
said
that
they
lived
upon
straw
and
sawdust
and
he
knew
that
i
did
not
believe
him
any
more
than
about
his
starshavings
and
this
was
just
the
thing
he
lovedto
mystify
honest
people
and
be
a
great
deal
too
knowing
however
i
may
judge
him
harshly
because
i
myself
tell
everything
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
to
do
with
all
that
enormous
lot
of
horses
and
why
he
had
not
exerted
his
wits
to
catch
the
red
deer
as
well
he
said
that
the
latter
would
have
been
against
the
laws
of
venery
and
might
have
brought
him
into
trouble
but
as
for
disposing
of
his
stud
it
would
give
him
little
difficulty
he
would
break
them
when
the
spring
weather
came
on
and
deal
with
them
as
they
required
and
keep
the
handsomest
for
breeding
the
rest
he
would
despatch
to
london
where
he
knew
plenty
of
horsedealers
and
he
doubted
not
that
they
would
fetch
him
as
much
as
ten
pounds
apiece
all
round
being
now
in
great
demand
i
told
him
i
wished
that
he
might
get
it
but
as
it
proved
afterwards
he
did
then
he
pressed
us
both
on
another
point
the
time
for
his
marriage
to
annie
and
mother
looked
at
me
to
say
when
and
i
looked
back
at
mother
however
knowing
something
of
the
world
and
unable
to
make
any
further
objection
by
reason
of
his
prosperity
i
said
that
we
must
even
do
as
the
fashionable
people
did
and
allow
the
maid
herself
to
settle
when
she
would
leave
home
and
all
and
this
i
spoke
with
a
very
bad
grace
being
perhaps
of
an
ancient
cast
and
over
fond
of
honestyi
mean
of
course
among
lower
people
but
tom
paid
little
heed
to
this
knowing
the
world
a
great
deal
better
than
ever
i
could
pretend
to
do
and
being
ready
to
take
a
thing
upon
which
he
had
set
his
mind
whether
it
came
with
a
good
grace
or
whether
it
came
with
a
bad
one
and
seeing
that
it
would
be
awkward
to
provoke
my
anger
he
left
the
room
before
more
words
to
submit
himself
to
annie
upon
this
i
went
in
search
of
lorna
to
tell
her
of
our
cousins
arrival
and
to
ask
whether
she
would
think
fit
to
see
him
or
to
dine
by
herself
that
day
for
she
should
do
exactly
as
it
pleased
her
in
everything
while
remaining
still
our
guest
but
i
rather
wished
that
she
might
choose
not
to
sit
in
toms
company
though
she
might
be
introduced
to
him
not
but
what
he
could
behave
quite
as
well
as
could
and
much
better
as
regarded
elegance
and
assurance
only
that
his
honesty
had
not
been
as
one
might
desire
but
lorna
had
some
curiosity
to
know
what
this
famous
man
was
like
and
declared
that
she
would
by
all
means
have
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
him
if
he
did
not
object
to
her
company
on
the
ground
of
the
doones
dishonesty
moreover
she
said
that
it
would
seem
a
most
foolish
air
on
her
part
and
one
which
would
cause
the
greatest
pain
to
annie
who
had
been
so
good
to
her
if
she
should
refuse
to
sit
at
table
with
a
man
who
held
the
kings
pardon
and
was
now
a
pattern
of
honesty
against
this
i
had
not
a
word
to
say
and
could
not
help
acknowledging
in
my
heart
that
she
was
right
as
well
as
wise
in
her
decision
and
afterwards
i
discovered
that
mother
would
have
been
much
displeased
if
she
had
decided
otherwise
accordingly
she
turned
away
with
one
of
her
very
sweetest
smiles
whose
beauty
none
can
describe
saying
that
she
must
not
meet
a
man
of
such
fashion
and
renown
in
her
common
gardening
frock
but
must
try
to
look
as
nice
as
she
could
if
only
in
honour
of
dear
annie
and
truth
to
tell
when
she
came
to
dinner
everything
about
her
was
the
neatest
and
prettiest
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
she
contrived
to
match
the
colours
so
to
suit
one
another
and
her
own
and
yet
with
a
certain
delicate
harmony
of
contrast
and
the
shape
of
everything
was
so
nice
so
that
when
she
came
into
the
room
with
a
crown
of
winning
modesty
upon
the
consciousness
of
beauty
i
was
quite
as
proud
as
if
the
queen
of
england
entered
my
mother
could
not
help
remarking
though
she
knew
that
it
was
not
mannerly
how
like
a
princess
lorna
looked
now
she
had
her
best
things
on
but
two
things
caught
squire
fagguss
eyes
after
he
had
made
a
most
gallant
bow
and
received
a
most
graceful
courtesy
and
he
kept
his
bright
bold
gaze
upon
them
first
on
one
and
then
on
the
other
until
my
darling
was
hot
with
blushes
and
i
was
ready
to
knock
him
down
if
he
had
not
been
our
visitor
but
here
again
i
should
have
been
wrong
as
i
was
apt
to
be
in
those
days
for
tom
intended
no
harm
whatever
and
his
gaze
was
of
pure
curiosity
though
annie
herself
was
vexed
with
it
the
two
objects
of
his
close
regard
were
first
and
most
worthily
lornas
face
and
secondly
the
ancient
necklace
restored
to
her
by
sir
ensor
doone
now
wishing
to
save
my
darlings
comfort
and
to
keep
things
quiet
i
shouted
out
that
dinner
was
ready
so
that
half
the
parish
could
hear
me
upon
which
my
mother
laughed
and
chid
me
and
despatched
her
guests
before
her
and
a
very
good
dinner
we
made
i
remember
and
a
very
happy
one
attending
to
the
women
first
as
now
is
the
manner
of
eating
except
among
the
workmen
with
them
of
course
it
is
needful
that
the
man
who
has
his
hours
fixed
should
be
served
first
and
make
the
utmost
of
his
time
for
feeding
while
the
women
may
go
on
as
much
as
ever
they
please
afterwards
but
with
us
who
are
not
bound
to
time
there
is
no
such
reason
to
be
quoted
and
the
women
being
the
weaker
vessels
should
be
the
first
to
begin
to
fill
and
so
we
always
arranged
it
now
though
our
annie
was
a
graceful
maid
and
lizzie
a
very
learned
one
you
should
have
seen
how
differently
lorna
managed
her
dining
she
never
took
more
than
about
a
quarter
of
a
mouthful
at
a
time
and
she
never
appeared
to
be
chewing
that
although
she
must
have
done
so
indeed
she
appeared
to
dine
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
no
consequence
and
as
if
she
could
think
of
other
things
more
than
of
her
business
all
this
and
her
own
manner
of
eating
i
described
to
eliza
once
when
i
wanted
to
vex
her
for
something
very
spiteful
that
she
had
said
and
i
never
succeeded
so
well
before
for
the
girl
was
quite
outrageous
having
her
own
perception
of
it
which
made
my
observation
ten
times
as
bitter
to
her
and
i
am
not
sure
but
what
she
ceased
to
like
poor
lorna
from
that
day
and
if
so
i
was
quite
paid
out
as
i
well
deserved
for
my
bit
of
satire
for
it
strikes
me
that
of
all
human
dealings
satire
is
the
very
lowest
and
most
mean
and
common
it
is
the
equivalent
in
words
of
what
bullying
is
in
deeds
and
no
more
bespeaks
a
clever
man
than
the
other
does
a
brave
one
these
two
wretched
tricks
exalt
a
fool
in
his
own
low
esteem
but
never
in
his
neighbours
for
the
deep
common
sense
of
our
nature
tells
that
no
man
of
a
genial
heart
or
of
any
spread
of
mind
can
take
pride
in
either
and
though
a
good
man
may
commit
the
one
fault
or
the
other
now
and
then
by
way
of
outlet
he
is
sure
to
have
compunctions
soon
and
to
scorn
himself
more
than
the
sufferer
now
when
the
young
maidens
were
gonefor
we
had
quite
a
high
dinner
of
fashion
that
day
with
betty
muxworthy
waiting
and
gwenny
carfax
at
the
gravyand
only
mother
and
tom
and
i
remained
at
the
white
deal
table
with
brandy
and
schnapps
and
hot
water
jugs
squire
faggus
said
quite
suddenly
and
perhaps
on
purpose
to
take
us
aback
in
case
of
our
hiding
anythingwhat
do
you
know
of
the
history
of
that
beautiful
maiden
good
mother
not
half
so
much
as
my
son
does
mother
answered
with
a
soft
smile
at
me
and
when
john
does
not
choose
to
tell
a
thing
wild
horses
will
not
pull
it
out
of
him
that
is
not
at
all
like
me
mother
i
replied
rather
sadly
you
know
almost
every
word
about
lorna
quite
as
well
as
i
do
almost
every
word
i
believe
john
for
you
never
tell
a
falsehood
but
the
few
unknown
may
be
of
all
the
most
important
to
me
to
this
i
made
no
answer
for
fear
of
going
beyond
the
truth
or
else
of
making
mischief
not
that
i
had
or
wished
to
have
any
mystery
with
mother
neither
was
there
in
purest
truth
any
mystery
in
the
matter
to
the
utmost
of
my
knowledge
and
the
only
things
that
i
had
kept
back
solely
for
mothers
comfort
were
the
death
of
poor
lord
alan
brandir
if
indeed
he
were
dead
and
the
connection
of
marwood
de
whichehalse
with
the
dealings
of
the
doones
and
the
threats
of
carver
doone
against
my
own
prosperity
and
may
be
one
or
two
little
things
harrowing
more
than
edifying
come
come
said
master
faggus
smiling
very
pleasantly
you
two
understand
each
other
if
any
two
on
earth
do
ah
if
i
had
only
had
a
mother
how
different
i
might
have
been
and
with
that
he
sighed
in
the
tone
which
always
overcame
mother
upon
that
subject
and
had
something
to
do
with
his
getting
annie
and
then
he
produced
his
pretty
box
full
of
rolled
tobacco
and
offered
me
one
as
i
now
had
joined
the
goodly
company
of
smokers
so
i
took
it
and
watched
what
he
did
with
his
own
lest
i
might
go
wrong
about
mine
but
when
our
cylinders
were
both
lighted
and
i
enjoying
mine
wonderfully
and
astonishing
mother
by
my
skill
tom
faggus
told
us
that
he
was
sure
he
had
seen
my
lornas
face
before
many
and
many
years
ago
when
she
was
quite
a
little
child
but
he
could
not
remember
where
it
was
or
anything
more
about
it
at
present
though
he
would
try
to
do
so
afterwards
he
could
not
be
mistaken
he
said
for
he
had
noticed
her
eyes
especially
and
had
never
seen
such
eyes
before
neither
again
until
this
day
i
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
ventured
into
the
doonevalley
but
he
shook
his
head
and
replied
that
he
valued
his
life
a
deal
too
much
for
that
then
we
put
it
to
him
whether
anything
might
assist
his
memory
but
he
said
that
he
knew
not
of
aught
to
do
so
unless
it
were
another
glass
of
schnapps
this
being
provided
he
grew
very
wise
and
told
us
clearly
and
candidly
that
we
were
both
very
foolish
for
he
said
that
we
were
keeping
lorna
at
the
risk
not
only
of
our
stock
and
the
house
above
our
heads
but
also
of
our
precious
lives
and
after
all
was
she
worth
it
although
so
very
beautiful
upon
which
i
told
him
with
indignation
that
her
beauty
was
the
least
part
of
her
goodness
and
that
i
would
thank
him
for
his
opinion
when
i
had
requested
it
bravo
our
john
ridd
he
answered
fools
will
be
fools
till
the
end
of
the
chapter
and
i
might
be
as
big
a
one
if
i
were
in
thy
shoes
john
nevertheless
in
the
name
of
god
dont
let
that
helpless
child
go
about
with
a
thing
worth
half
the
county
on
her
she
is
worth
all
the
county
herself
said
i
and
all
england
put
together
but
she
has
nothing
worth
half
a
rick
of
hay
upon
her
for
the
ring
i
gave
her
cost
onlyand
here
i
stopped
for
mother
was
looking
and
i
never
would
tell
her
how
much
it
had
cost
me
though
she
had
tried
fifty
times
to
find
out
tush
the
ring
tom
faggus
cried
with
a
contempt
that
moved
me
i
would
never
have
stopped
a
man
for
that
but
the
necklace
you
great
oaf
the
necklace
is
worth
all
your
farm
put
together
and
your
uncle
bens
fortune
to
the
back
of
it
ay
and
all
the
town
of
dulverton
what
said
i
that
common
glass
thing
which
she
has
had
from
her
childhood
glass
indeed
they
are
the
finest
brilliants
ever
i
set
eyes
on
and
i
have
handled
a
good
many
surely
cried
mother
now
flushing
as
red
as
toms
own
cheeks
with
excitement
you
must
be
wrong
or
the
young
mistress
would
herself
have
known
it
i
was
greatly
pleased
with
my
mother
for
calling
lorna
the
young
mistress
it
was
not
done
for
the
sake
of
her
diamonds
whether
they
were
glass
or
not
but
because
she
felt
as
i
had
done
that
tom
faggus
a
man
of
no
birth
whatever
was
speaking
beyond
his
mark
in
calling
a
lady
like
lorna
a
helpless
child
as
well
as
in
his
general
tone
which
displayed
no
deference
he
might
have
been
used
to
the
quality
in
the
way
of
stopping
their
coaches
or
roystering
at
hotels
with
them
but
he
never
had
met
a
high
lady
before
in
equality
and
upon
virtue
and
we
both
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
known
it
and
to
have
thanked
us
for
the
opportunity
in
a
word
to
have
behaved
a
great
deal
more
humbly
than
he
had
even
tried
to
do
trust
me
answered
tom
in
his
loftiest
manner
which
annie
said
was
so
noble
but
which
seemed
to
me
rather
flashy
trust
me
good
mother
and
simple
john
for
knowing
brilliants
when
i
see
them
i
would
have
stopped
an
eighthorse
coach
with
four
carabined
outriders
for
such
a
booty
as
that
but
alas
those
days
are
over
those
were
days
worth
living
in
ah
i
never
shall
know
the
like
again
how
fine
it
was
by
moonlight
master
faggus
began
my
mother
with
a
manner
of
some
dignity
such
as
she
could
sometimes
use
by
right
of
her
integrity
and
thorough
kindness
to
every
one
this
is
not
the
tone
in
which
you
have
hitherto
spoken
to
me
about
your
former
pursuits
and
life
i
fear
that
the
spiritsbut
here
she
stopped
because
the
spirits
were
her
own
and
tom
was
our
visitorwhat
i
mean
master
faggus
is
this
you
have
won
my
daughters
heart
somehow
and
you
won
my
consent
to
the
matter
through
your
honest
sorrow
and
manly
undertaking
to
lead
a
different
life
and
touch
no
property
but
your
own
annie
is
my
eldest
daughter
and
the
child
of
a
most
upright
man
i
love
her
best
of
all
on
earth
next
to
my
boy
john
herehere
mother
gave
me
a
mighty
squeeze
to
be
sure
that
she
would
have
me
at
leastand
i
will
not
risk
my
annies
life
with
a
man
who
yearns
for
the
highway
having
made
this
very
long
speech
for
her
mother
came
home
upon
my
shoulder
and
wept
so
that
but
for
heeding
her
i
would
have
taken
tom
by
the
nose
and
thrown
him
and
winnie
after
him
over
our
farmyard
gate
for
i
am
violent
when
roused
and
freely
hereby
acknowledge
it
though
even
my
enemies
will
own
that
it
takes
a
great
deal
to
rouse
me
but
i
do
consider
the
grief
and
tears
when
justly
caused
of
my
dearest
friends
to
be
a
great
deal
to
rouse

chapter
xlvii
jeremy
in
danger
nothing
very
long
abides
as
the
greatest
of
all
writers
in
whose
extent
i
am
for
ever
lost
in
raptured
wonder
and
yet
for
ever
quite
at
home
as
if
his
heart
were
mine
although
his
brains
so
different
in
a
word
as
mr
william
shakespeare
in
every
one
of
his
works
insists
with
a
humoured
melancholy
and
if
my
journey
to
london
led
to
nothing
else
of
advancement
it
took
me
a
hundred
years
in
front
of
what
i
might
else
have
been
by
the
most
simple
accident
two
women
were
scolding
one
another
across
the
road
very
violently
both
from
upstair
windows
and
i
in
my
hurry
for
quiet
life
and
not
knowing
what
might
come
down
upon
me
quickened
my
step
for
the
nearest
corner
but
suddenly
something
fell
on
my
head
and
at
first
i
was
afraid
to
look
especially
as
it
weighed
heavily
but
hearing
no
breakage
of
ware
and
only
the
other
scold
laughing
heartily
i
turned
me
about
and
espied
a
book
which
one
had
cast
at
the
other
hoping
to
break
her
window
so
i
took
the
book
and
tendered
it
at
the
door
of
the
house
from
which
it
had
fallen
but
the
watchman
came
along
just
then
and
the
man
at
the
door
declared
that
it
never
came
from
their
house
and
begged
me
to
say
no
more
this
i
promised
readily
never
wishing
to
make
mischief
and
i
said
good
sir
now
take
the
book
i
will
go
on
to
my
business
but
he
answered
that
he
would
do
no
such
thing
for
the
book
alone
being
hurled
so
hard
would
convict
his
people
of
a
lewd
assault
and
he
begged
me
if
i
would
do
a
good
turn
to
put
the
book
under
my
coat
and
go
and
so
i
did
in
part
at
least
for
i
did
not
put
the
book
under
my
coat
but
went
along
with
it
openly
looking
for
any
to
challenge
it
now
this
book
so
acquired
has
been
not
only
the
joy
of
my
younger
days
and
main
delight
of
my
manhood
but
also
the
comfort
and
even
the
hope
of
my
now
declining
years
in
a
word
it
is
next
to
my
bible
to
me
and
written
in
equal
english
and
if
you
espy
any
goodness
whatever
in
my
own
loose
style
of
writing
you
must
not
thank
me
john
ridd
for
it
but
the
writer
who
holds
the
champions
belt
in
wit
as
i
once
did
in
wrestling
now
as
nothing
very
long
abides
it
cannot
be
expected
that
a
womans
anger
should
last
very
long
if
she
be
at
all
of
the
proper
sort
and
my
mother
being
one
of
the
very
best
could
not
long
retain
her
wrath
against
the
squire
faggus
especially
when
she
came
to
reflect
upon
annies
suggestion
how
natural
and
one
might
say
how
inevitable
it
was
that
a
young
man
fond
of
adventure
and
change
and
winning
good
profits
by
jeopardy
should
not
settle
down
without
some
regrets
to
a
fixed
abode
and
a
life
of
sameness
however
safe
and
respectable
and
even
as
annie
put
the
case
tom
deserved
the
greater
credit
for
vanquishing
so
nobly
these
yearnings
of
his
nature
and
it
seemed
very
hard
to
upbraid
him
considering
how
good
his
motives
were
neither
could
annie
understand
how
mother
could
reconcile
it
with
her
knowledge
of
the
bible
and
the
one
sheep
that
was
lost
and
the
hundredth
piece
of
silver
and
the
man
that
went
down
to
jericho
whether
annies
logic
was
good
and
sound
i
am
sure
i
cannot
tell
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
ought
to
have
let
the
jericho
traveller
alone
inasmuch
as
he
rather
fell
among
tom
fagusses
than
resembled
them
however
her
reasoning
was
too
much
for
mother
to
hold
out
against
and
tom
was
replaced
and
more
than
that
being
regarded
now
as
an
injured
man
but
how
my
mother
contrived
to
know
that
because
she
had
been
too
hard
upon
tom
he
must
be
right
about
the
necklace
is
a
point
which
i
never
could
clearly
perceive
though
no
doubt
she
could
explain
it
to
prove
herself
right
in
the
conclusion
she
went
herself
to
fetch
lorna
that
the
trinket
might
be
examined
before
the
day
grew
dark
my
darling
came
in
with
a
very
quick
glance
and
smile
at
my
cigarro
for
i
was
having
the
third
by
this
time
to
keep
things
in
amity
and
i
waved
it
towards
her
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
that
i
can
do
it
and
then
mother
led
her
up
to
the
light
for
tom
to
examine
her
necklace
on
the
shapely
curve
of
her
neck
it
hung
like
dewdrops
upon
a
white
hyacinth
and
i
was
vexed
that
tom
should
have
the
chance
to
see
it
there
but
even
if
she
had
read
my
thoughts
or
outrun
them
with
her
own
lorna
turned
away
and
softly
took
the
jewels
from
the
place
which
so
much
adorned
them
and
as
she
turned
away
they
sparkled
through
the
rich
dark
waves
of
hair
then
she
laid
the
glittering
circlet
in
my
mothers
hands
and
tom
faggus
took
it
eagerly
and
bore
it
to
the
window
dont
you
go
out
of
sight
i
said
you
cannot
resist
such
things
as
those
if
they
be
what
you
think
them
jack
i
shall
have
to
trounce
thee
yet
i
am
now
a
man
of
honour
and
entitled
to
the
duello
what
will
you
take
for
it
mistress
lorna
at
a
hazard
say
now
i
am
not
accustomed
to
sell
things
sir
replied
lorna
who
did
not
like
him
much
else
she
would
have
answered
sportively
what
is
it
worth
in
your
opinion
do
you
think
it
is
worth
five
pounds
now
oh
no
i
never
had
so
much
money
as
that
in
all
my
life
it
is
very
bright
and
very
pretty
but
it
cannot
be
worth
five
pounds
i
am
sure
what
a
chance
for
a
bargain
oh
if
it
were
not
for
annie
i
could
make
my
fortune
but
sir
i
would
not
sell
it
to
you
not
for
twenty
times
five
pounds
my
grandfather
was
so
kind
about
it
and
i
think
it
belonged
to
my
mother
there
are
twentyfive
rose
diamonds
in
it
and
twentyfive
large
brilliants
that
cannot
be
matched
in
london
how
say
you
mistress
lorna
to
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
my
darlings
eyes
so
flashed
at
this
brighter
than
any
diamonds
that
i
said
to
myself
well
all
have
faults
and
now
i
have
found
out
lornasshe
is
fond
of
money
and
then
i
sighed
rather
heavily
for
of
all
faults
this
seems
to
me
one
of
the
worst
in
a
woman
but
even
before
my
sigh
was
finished
i
had
cause
to
condemn
myself
for
lorna
took
the
necklace
very
quietly
from
the
hands
of
squire
faggus
who
had
not
half
done
with
admiring
it
and
she
went
up
to
my
mother
with
the
sweetest
smile
i
ever
saw
dear
kind
mother
i
am
so
glad
she
said
in
a
whisper
coaxing
mother
out
of
sight
of
all
but
me
now
you
will
have
it
wont
you
dear
and
i
shall
be
so
happy
for
a
thousandth
part
of
your
kindness
to
me
no
jewels
in
the
world
can
match
i
cannot
lay
before
you
the
grace
with
which
she
did
it
all
the
air
of
seeking
favour
rather
than
conferring
it
and
the
highbred
fear
of
giving
offence
which
is
of
all
fears
the
noblest
mother
knew
not
what
to
say
of
course
she
would
never
dream
of
taking
such
a
gift
as
that
and
yet
she
saw
how
sadly
lorna
would
be
disappointed
therefore
mother
did
from
habit
what
she
almost
always
did
she
called
me
to
help
her
but
knowing
that
my
eyes
were
fullfor
anything
noble
moves
me
so
quite
as
rashly
as
things
pitifuli
pretended
not
to
hear
my
mother
but
to
see
a
wild
cat
in
the
dairy
therefore
i
cannot
tell
what
mother
said
in
reply
to
lorna
for
when
i
came
back
quite
eager
to
let
my
love
know
how
i
worshipped
her
and
how
deeply
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
for
meanly
wronging
her
in
my
heart
behold
tom
faggus
had
gotten
again
the
necklace
which
had
such
charms
for
him
and
was
delivering
all
around
but
especially
to
annie
who
was
wondering
at
his
learning
a
dissertation
on
precious
stones
and
his
sentiments
about
those
in
his
hand
he
said
that
the
work
was
very
ancient
but
undoubtedly
very
good
the
cutting
of
every
line
was
true
and
every
angle
was
in
its
place
and
this
he
said
made
all
the
difference
in
the
lustre
of
the
stone
and
therefore
in
its
value
for
if
the
facets
were
illmatched
and
the
points
of
light
so
ever
little
out
of
perfect
harmony
all
the
lustre
of
the
jewel
would
be
loose
and
wavering
and
the
central
fire
dulled
instead
of
answering
as
it
should
to
all
possibilities
of
gaze
and
overpowering
any
eye
intent
on
its
deeper
mysteries
we
laughed
at
the
squires
dissertation
for
how
should
he
know
all
these
things
being
nothing
better
and
indeed
much
worse
than
a
mere
northmolton
blacksmith
he
took
our
laughter
with
much
good
nature
having
annie
to
squeeze
his
hand
and
convey
her
grief
at
our
ignorance
but
he
said
that
of
one
thing
he
was
quite
certain
and
therein
i
believed
him
to
wit
that
a
trinket
of
this
kind
never
could
have
belonged
to
any
ignoble
family
but
to
one
of
the
very
highest
and
most
wealthy
in
england
and
looking
at
lorna
i
felt
that
she
must
have
come
from
a
higher
source
than
the
very
best
of
diamonds
tom
faggus
said
that
the
necklace
was
made
he
would
answer
for
it
in
amsterdam
two
or
three
hundred
years
ago
long
before
london
jewellers
had
begun
to
meddle
with
diamonds
and
on
the
gold
clasp
he
found
some
letters
done
in
some
inverted
way
the
meaning
of
which
was
beyond
him
also
a
bearing
of
some
kind
which
he
believed
was
a
mountaincat
and
thereupon
he
declared
that
now
he
had
earned
another
glass
of
schnapps
and
would
mistress
lorna
mix
it
for
him
i
was
amazed
at
his
impudence
and
annie
who
thought
this
her
business
did
not
look
best
pleased
and
i
hoped
that
lorna
would
tell
him
at
once
to
go
and
do
it
for
himself
but
instead
of
that
she
rose
to
do
it
with
a
soft
humility
which
went
direct
to
the
heart
of
tom
and
he
leaped
up
with
a
curse
at
himself
and
took
the
hot
water
from
her
and
would
not
allow
her
to
do
anything
except
to
put
the
sugar
in
and
then
he
bowed
to
her
grandly
i
knew
what
lorna
was
thinking
of
she
was
thinking
all
the
time
that
her
necklace
had
been
taken
by
the
doones
with
violence
upon
some
great
robbery
and
that
squire
faggus
knew
it
though
he
would
not
show
his
knowledge
and
that
this
was
perhaps
the
reason
why
mother
had
refused
it
so
we
said
no
more
about
the
necklace
for
a
long
time
afterwards
neither
did
my
darling
wear
it
now
that
she
knew
its
value
but
did
not
know
its
history
she
came
to
me
the
very
next
day
trying
to
look
cheerful
and
begged
me
if
i
loved
her
never
mind
how
little
to
take
charge
of
it
again
as
i
once
had
done
before
and
not
even
to
let
her
know
in
what
place
i
stored
it
i
told
her
that
this
last
request
i
could
not
comply
with
for
having
been
round
her
neck
so
often
it
was
now
a
sacred
thing
more
than
a
million
pounds
could
be
therefore
it
should
dwell
for
the
present
in
the
neighbourhood
of
my
heart
and
so
could
not
be
far
from
her
at
this
she
smiled
her
own
sweet
smile
and
touched
my
forehead
with
her
lips
and
wished
that
she
could
only
learn
how
to
deserve
such
love
as
mine
tom
faggus
took
his
good
departure
which
was
a
kind
farewell
to
me
on
the
very
day
i
am
speaking
of
the
day
after
his
arrival
tom
was
a
thoroughly
upright
man
according
to
his
own
standard
and
you
might
rely
upon
him
always
up
to
a
certain
point
i
mean
to
be
there
or
thereabouts
but
sometimes
things
were
too
many
for
tom
especially
with
ardent
spirits
and
then
he
judged
perhaps
too
much
with
only
himself
for
the
jury
at
any
rate
i
would
trust
him
fully
for
candour
and
for
honesty
in
almost
every
case
in
which
he
himself
could
have
no
interest
and
so
we
got
on
very
well
together
and
he
thought
me
a
fool
and
i
tried
my
best
not
to
think
anything
worse
of
him
scarcely
was
tom
clean
out
of
sight
and
annies
tears
not
dry
yet
for
she
always
made
a
point
of
crying
upon
his
departure
when
in
came
master
jeremy
stickles
splashed
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
and
not
in
the
very
best
of
humours
though
happy
to
get
back
again
curse
those
fellows
he
cried
with
a
stamp
which
sent
the
water
hissing
from
his
boot
upon
the
embers
a
pretty
plight
you
may
call
this
for
his
majestys
commissioner
to
return
to
his
headquarters
in
annie
my
dear
for
he
was
always
very
affable
with
annie
will
you
help
me
off
with
my
overalls
and
then
turn
your
pretty
hand
to
the
gridiron
not
a
blessed
morsel
have
i
touched
for
more
than
twentyfour
hours
surely
then
you
must
be
quite
starving
sir
my
sister
replied
with
the
greatest
zeal
for
she
did
love
a
man
with
an
appetite
how
glad
i
am
that
the
fire
is
clear
but
lizzie
who
happened
to
be
there
said
with
her
peculiar
smile
master
stickles
must
be
used
to
it
for
he
never
comes
back
without
telling
us
that
hush
cried
annie
quite
shocked
with
her
how
would
you
like
to
be
used
to
it
now
betty
be
quick
with
the
things
for
me
pork
or
mutton
or
deers
meat
sir
we
have
some
cured
since
the
autumn
oh
deers
meat
by
all
means
jeremy
stickles
answered
i
have
tasted
none
since
i
left
you
though
dreaming
of
it
often
well
this
is
better
than
being
chased
over
the
moors
for
ones
life
john
all
the
way
from
landacre
bridge
i
have
ridden
a
race
for
my
precious
life
at
the
peril
of
my
limbs
and
neck
three
great
doones
galloping
after
me
and
a
good
job
for
me
that
they
were
so
big
or
they
must
have
overtaken
me
just
go
and
see
to
my
horse
john
thats
an
excellent
lad
he
deserves
a
good
turn
this
day
from
me
and
i
will
render
it
to
him
however
he
left
me
to
do
it
while
he
made
himself
comfortable
and
in
truth
the
horse
required
care
he
was
blown
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
and
plastered
with
mud
and
steaming
so
that
the
stable
was
quite
full
with
it
by
the
time
i
had
put
the
poor
fellow
to
rights
his
master
had
finished
dinner
and
was
in
a
more
pleasant
humour
having
even
offered
to
kiss
annie
out
of
pure
gratitude
as
he
said
but
annie
answered
with
spirit
that
gratitude
must
not
be
shown
by
increasing
the
obligation
jeremy
made
reply
to
this
that
his
only
way
to
be
grateful
then
was
to
tell
us
his
story
and
so
he
did
at
greater
length
than
i
can
here
repeat
it
for
it
does
not
bear
particularly
upon
lornas
fortunes
it
appears
that
as
he
was
riding
towards
us
from
the
town
of
southmolton
in
devonshire
he
found
the
roads
very
soft
and
heavy
and
the
floods
out
in
all
directions
but
met
with
no
other
difficulty
until
he
came
to
landacre
bridge
he
had
only
a
single
trooper
with
him
a
man
not
of
the
militia
but
of
the
kings
army
whom
jeremy
had
brought
from
exeter
as
these
two
descended
towards
the
bridge
they
observed
that
both
the
kensford
water
and
the
river
barle
were
pouring
down
in
mighty
floods
from
the
melting
of
the
snow
so
great
indeed
was
the
torrent
after
they
united
that
only
the
parapets
of
the
bridge
could
be
seen
above
the
water
the
road
across
either
bank
being
covered
and
very
deep
on
the
hither
side
the
trooper
did
not
like
the
look
of
it
and
proposed
to
ride
back
again
and
round
by
way
of
simonsbath
where
the
stream
is
smaller
but
stickles
would
not
have
it
so
and
dashing
into
the
river
swam
his
horse
for
the
bridge
and
gained
it
with
some
little
trouble
and
there
he
found
the
water
not
more
than
up
to
his
horses
knees
perhaps
on
the
crown
of
the
bridge
he
turned
his
horse
to
watch
the
troopers
passage
and
to
help
him
with
directions
when
suddenly
he
saw
him
fall
headlong
into
the
torrent
and
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
from
behind
and
felt
a
shock
to
his
own
body
such
as
lifted
him
out
of
the
saddle
turning
round
he
beheld
three
men
risen
up
from
behind
the
hedge
on
one
side
of
his
onward
road
two
of
them
ready
to
load
again
and
one
with
his
gun
unfired
waiting
to
get
good
aim
at
him
then
jeremy
did
a
gallant
thing
for
which
i
doubt
whether
i
should
have
had
the
presence
of
mind
in
danger
he
saw
that
to
swim
his
horse
back
again
would
be
almost
certain
death
as
affording
such
a
target
where
even
a
wound
must
be
fatal
therefore
he
struck
the
spurs
into
the
nag
and
rode
through
the
water
straight
at
the
man
who
was
pointing
the
long
gun
at
him
if
the
horse
had
been
carried
off
his
legs
there
must
have
been
an
end
of
jeremy
for
the
other
men
were
getting
ready
to
have
another
shot
at
him
but
luckily
the
horse
galloped
right
on
without
any
need
for
swimming
being
himself
excited
no
doubt
by
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
of
it
and
jeremy
lay
almost
flat
on
his
neck
so
as
to
give
little
space
for
good
aim
with
the
mane
tossing
wildly
in
front
of
him
now
if
that
young
fellow
with
the
gun
had
his
brains
as
ready
as
his
flint
was
he
would
have
shot
the
horse
at
once
and
then
had
stickles
at
his
mercy
but
instead
of
that
he
let
fly
at
the
man
and
missed
him
altogether
being
scared
perhaps
by
the
pistol
which
jeremy
showed
him
the
mouth
of
and
galloping
by
at
full
speed
master
stickles
tried
to
leave
his
mark
behind
him
for
he
changed
the
aim
of
his
pistol
to
the
biggest
man
who
was
loading
his
gun
and
cursing
like
ten
cannons
but
the
pistol
missed
fire
no
doubt
from
the
flood
which
had
gurgled
in
over
the
holsters
and
jeremy
seeing
three
horses
tethered
at
a
gate
just
up
the
hill
knew
that
he
had
not
yet
escaped
but
had
more
of
danger
behind
him
he
tried
his
other
great
pistol
at
one
of
the
horses
tethered
there
so
as
to
lessen
if
possible
the
number
of
his
pursuers
but
the
powder
again
failed
him
and
he
durst
not
stop
to
cut
the
bridles
bearing
the
men
coming
up
the
hill
so
he
even
made
the
most
of
his
start
thanking
god
that
his
weight
was
light
compared
at
least
to
what
theirs
was
and
another
thing
he
had
noticed
which
gave
him
some
hope
of
escaping
to
wit
that
the
horses
of
the
doones
although
very
handsome
animals
were
suffering
still
from
the
bitter
effects
of
the
late
long
frost
and
the
scarcity
of
fodder
if
they
do
not
catch
me
up
or
shoot
me
in
the
course
of
the
first
two
miles
i
may
see
my
home
again
this
was
what
he
said
to
himself
as
he
turned
to
mark
what
they
were
about
from
the
brow
of
the
steep
hill
he
saw
the
flooded
valley
shining
with
the
breadth
of
water
and
the
troopers
horse
on
the
other
side
shaking
his
drenched
flanks
and
neighing
and
halfway
down
the
hill
he
saw
the
three
doones
mounting
hastily
and
then
he
knew
that
his
only
chance
lay
in
the
stoutness
of
his
steed
the
horse
was
in
pretty
good
condition
and
the
rider
knew
him
thoroughly
and
how
to
make
the
most
of
him
and
though
they
had
travelled
some
miles
that
day
through
very
heavy
ground
the
bath
in
the
river
had
washed
the
mud
off
and
been
some
refreshment
therefore
stickles
encouraged
his
nag
and
put
him
into
a
good
hard
gallop
heading
away
towards
withycombe
at
first
he
had
thought
of
turning
to
the
right
and
making
off
for
withypool
a
mile
or
so
down
the
valley
but
his
good
sense
told
him
that
no
one
there
would
dare
to
protect
him
against
the
doones
so
he
resolved
to
go
on
his
way
yet
faster
than
he
had
intended
the
three
villains
came
after
him
with
all
the
speed
they
could
muster
making
sure
from
the
badness
of
the
road
that
he
must
stick
fast
ere
long
and
so
be
at
their
mercy
and
this
was
jeremys
chiefest
fear
for
the
ground
being
soft
and
thoroughly
rotten
after
so
much
frost
and
snow
the
poor
horse
had
terrible
work
of
it
with
no
time
to
pick
the
way
and
even
more
good
luck
than
skill
was
needed
to
keep
him
from
foundering
how
jeremy
prayed
for
an
exmoor
fog
such
as
he
had
often
sworn
at
that
he
might
turn
aside
and
lurk
while
his
pursuers
went
past
him
but
no
fog
came
nor
even
a
storm
to
damp
the
priming
of
their
guns
neither
was
wood
or
coppice
nigh
nor
any
place
to
hide
in
only
hills
and
moor
and
valleys
with
flying
shadows
over
them
and
great
banks
of
snow
in
the
corners
at
one
time
poor
stickles
was
quite
in
despair
for
after
leaping
a
little
brook
which
crosses
the
track
at
newland
be
stuck
fast
in
a
dancing
bog
as
we
call
them
upon
exmoor
the
horse
had
broken
through
the
crust
of
moss
and
sedge
and
marishweed
and
could
do
nothing
but
wallow
and
sink
with
the
black
water
spirting
over
him
and
jeremy
struggling
with
all
his
might
saw
the
three
villains
now
topping
the
crest
less
than
a
furlong
behind
him
and
heard
them
shout
in
their
savage
delight
with
the
calmness
of
despair
he
yet
resolved
to
have
one
more
try
for
it
and
scrambling
over
the
horses
head
gained
firm
land
and
tugged
at
the
bridle
the
poor
nag
replied
with
all
his
power
to
the
call
upon
his
courage
and
reared
his
forefeet
out
of
the
slough
and
with
straining
eyeballs
gazed
at
him
now
said
jeremy
now
my
fine
fellow
lifting
him
with
the
bridle
and
the
brave
beast
gathered
the
roll
of
his
loins
and
sprang
from
his
quagmired
haunches
one
more
spring
and
he
was
on
earth
again
instead
of
being
under
it
and
jeremy
leaped
on
his
back
and
stooped
for
he
knew
that
they
would
fire
two
bullets
whistled
over
him
as
the
horse
mad
with
fright
dashed
forward
and
in
five
minutes
more
he
had
come
to
the
exe
and
the
pursuers
had
fallen
behind
him
the
exe
though
a
much
smaller
stream
than
the
barle
now
ran
in
a
foaming
torrent
unbridged
and
too
wide
for
leaping
but
jeremys
horse
took
the
water
well
and
both
he
and
his
rider
were
lightened
as
well
as
comforted
by
it
and
as
they
passed
towards
lucott
hill
and
struck
upon
the
founts
of
lynn
the
horses
of
the
three
pursuers
began
to
tire
under
them
then
jeremy
stickles
knew
that
if
he
could
only
escape
the
sloughs
he
was
safe
for
the
present
and
so
he
stood
up
in
his
stirrups
and
gave
them
a
loud
halloo
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
foxes
their
only
answer
was
to
fire
the
remaining
charge
at
him
but
the
distance
was
too
great
for
any
aim
from
horseback
and
the
dropping
bullet
idly
ploughed
the
sod
upon
one
side
of
him
he
acknowledged
it
with
a
wave
of
his
hat
and
laid
one
thumb
to
his
nose
in
the
manner
fashionable
in
london
for
expression
of
contempt
however
they
followed
him
yet
farther
hoping
to
make
him
pay
out
dearly
if
he
should
only
miss
the
track
or
fall
upon
morasses
but
the
neighbourhood
of
our
lynn
stream
is
not
so
very
boggy
and
the
kings
messenger
now
knew
his
way
as
well
as
any
of
his
pursuers
did
and
so
he
arrived
at
plovers
barrows
thankful
and
in
rare
appetite
but
was
the
poor
soldier
drowned
asked
annie
and
you
never
went
to
look
for
him
oh
how
very
dreadful
shot
or
drowned
i
know
not
which
thank
god
it
was
only
a
trooper
but
they
shall
pay
for
it
as
dearly
as
if
it
had
been
a
captain
and
how
was
it
you
were
struck
by
a
bullet
and
only
shaken
in
your
saddle
had
you
a
coat
of
mail
on
or
of
milanese
chainarmour
now
master
stickles
had
you
no
mistress
lizzie
we
do
not
wear
things
of
that
kind
nowadays
you
are
apt
i
perceive
at
romances
but
i
happened
to
have
a
little
flat
bottle
of
the
best
stoneware
slung
beneath
my
saddlecloak
and
filled
with
the
very
best
eau
de
vie
from
the
george
hotel
at
southmolton
the
brand
of
it
now
is
upon
my
back
oh
the
murderous
scoundrels
what
a
brave
spirit
they
have
spilled
you
had
better
set
to
and
thank
god
said
i
that
they
have
not
spilled
a
braver
one
chapter
xlviii
every
man
must
defend
himself
it
was
only
right
in
jeremy
stickles
and
of
the
simplest
common
sense
that
he
would
not
tell
before
our
girls
what
the
result
of
his
journey
was
but
he
led
me
aside
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
told
me
all
about
it
saying
that
i
knew
as
well
as
he
did
that
it
was
not
womans
business
this
i
took
as
it
was
meant
for
a
gentle
caution
that
lorna
whom
he
had
not
seen
as
yet
must
not
be
informed
of
any
of
his
doings
herein
i
quite
agreed
with
him
not
only
for
his
furtherance
but
because
i
always
think
that
women
of
whatever
mind
are
best
when
least
they
meddle
with
the
things
that
appertain
to
men
master
stickles
complained
that
the
weather
had
been
against
him
bitterly
closing
all
the
roads
around
him
even
as
it
had
done
with
us
it
had
taken
him
eight
days
he
said
to
get
from
exeter
to
plymouth
whither
he
found
that
most
of
the
troops
had
been
drafted
off
from
exeter
when
all
were
told
there
was
but
a
battalion
of
one
of
the
kings
horse
regiments
and
two
companies
of
foot
soldiers
and
their
commanders
had
orders
later
than
the
date
of
jeremys
commission
on
no
account
to
quit
the
southern
coast
and
march
inland
therefore
although
they
would
gladly
have
come
for
a
brush
with
the
celebrated
doones
it
was
more
than
they
durst
attempt
in
the
face
of
their
instructions
however
they
spared
him
a
single
trooper
as
a
companion
of
the
road
and
to
prove
to
the
justices
of
the
county
and
the
lord
lieutenant
that
he
had
their
approval
to
these
authorities
master
stickles
now
was
forced
to
address
himself
although
he
would
rather
have
had
one
trooper
than
a
score
from
the
very
best
trained
bands
for
these
trained
bands
had
afforded
very
good
soldiers
in
the
time
of
the
civil
wars
and
for
some
years
afterwards
but
now
their
discipline
was
gone
and
the
younger
generation
had
seen
no
real
fighting
each
would
have
his
own
opinion
and
would
want
to
argue
it
and
if
he
were
not
allowed
he
went
about
his
duty
in
such
a
temper
as
to
prove
that
his
own
way
was
the
best
neither
was
this
the
worst
of
it
for
jeremy
made
no
doubt
but
what
if
he
could
only
get
the
militia
to
turn
out
in
force
he
might
manage
with
the
help
of
his
own
men
to
force
the
stronghold
of
the
enemy
but
the
truth
was
that
the
officers
knowing
how
hard
it
would
be
to
collect
their
men
at
that
time
of
the
year
and
in
that
state
of
the
weather
began
with
one
accord
to
make
every
possible
excuse
and
especially
they
pressed
this
point
that
bagworthy
was
not
in
their
county
the
devonshire
people
affirming
vehemently
that
it
lay
in
the
shire
of
somerset
and
the
somersetshire
folk
averring
even
with
imprecations
that
it
lay
in
devonshire
now
i
believe
the
truth
to
be
that
the
boundary
of
the
two
counties
as
well
as
of
oare
and
brendon
parishes
is
defined
by
the
bagworthy
river
so
that
the
disputants
on
both
sides
were
both
right
and
wrong
upon
this
master
stickles
suggested
and
as
i
thought
very
sensibly
that
the
two
counties
should
unite
and
equally
contribute
to
the
extirpation
of
this
pest
which
shamed
and
injured
them
both
alike
but
hence
arose
another
difficulty
for
the
men
of
devon
said
they
would
march
when
somerset
had
taken
the
field
and
the
sons
of
somerset
replied
that
indeed
they
were
quite
ready
but
what
were
their
cousins
of
devonshire
doing
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
kings
commissioner
returned
without
any
army
whatever
but
with
promise
of
two
hundred
men
when
the
roads
should
be
more
passable
and
meanwhile
what
were
we
to
do
abandoned
as
we
were
to
the
mercies
of
the
doones
with
only
our
own
hands
to
help
us
and
herein
i
grieved
at
my
own
folly
in
having
let
tom
faggus
go
whose
wit
and
courage
would
have
been
worth
at
least
half
a
dozen
men
to
us
upon
this
matter
i
held
long
council
with
my
good
friend
stickles
telling
him
all
about
lornas
presence
and
what
i
knew
of
her
history
he
agreed
with
me
that
we
could
not
hope
to
escape
an
attack
from
the
outlaws
and
the
more
especially
now
that
they
knew
himself
to
be
returned
to
us
also
he
praised
me
for
my
forethought
in
having
threshed
out
all
our
corn
and
hidden
the
produce
in
such
a
manner
that
they
were
not
likely
to
find
it
furthermore
he
recommended
that
all
the
entrances
to
the
house
should
at
once
be
strengthened
and
a
watch
must
be
maintained
at
night
and
he
thought
it
wiser
that
i
should
go
late
as
it
was
to
lynmouth
if
a
horse
could
pass
the
valley
and
fetch
every
one
of
his
mounted
troopers
who
might
now
be
quartered
there
also
if
any
men
of
courage
though
capable
only
of
handling
a
pitchfork
could
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
i
was
to
try
to
summon
them
but
our
district
is
so
thinly
peopled
that
i
had
little
faith
in
this
however
my
errand
was
given
me
and
i
set
forth
upon
it
for
john
fry
was
afraid
of
the
waters
knowing
how
fiercely
the
floods
were
out
i
resolved
to
travel
the
higher
road
by
cosgate
and
through
countisbury
therefore
i
swam
my
horse
through
the
lynn
at
the
ford
below
our
house
where
sometimes
you
may
step
across
and
thence
galloped
up
and
along
the
hills
i
could
see
all
the
inland
valleys
ribbond
with
broad
waters
and
in
every
winding
crook
the
banks
of
snow
that
fed
them
while
on
my
right
the
turbid
sea
was
flaked
with
april
showers
but
when
i
descended
the
hill
towards
lynmouth
i
feared
that
my
journey
was
all
in
vain
for
the
east
lynn
which
is
our
river
was
ramping
and
roaring
frightfully
lashing
whole
trunks
of
trees
on
the
rocks
and
rending
them
and
grinding
them
and
into
it
rushed
from
the
opposite
side
a
torrent
even
madder
upsetting
what
it
came
to
aid
shattering
wave
with
boiling
billow
and
scattering
wrath
with
fury
it
was
certain
death
to
attempt
the
passage
and
the
little
wooden
footbridge
had
been
carried
away
long
ago
and
the
men
i
was
seeking
must
be
of
course
on
the
other
side
of
this
deluge
for
on
my
side
there
was
not
a
single
house
i
followed
the
bank
of
the
flood
to
the
beach
some
two
or
three
hundred
yards
below
and
there
had
the
luck
to
see
will
watcombe
on
the
opposite
side
caulking
an
old
boat
though
i
could
not
make
him
hear
a
word
from
the
deafening
roar
of
the
torrent
i
got
him
to
understand
at
last
that
i
wanted
to
cross
over
upon
this
he
fetched
another
man
and
the
two
of
them
launched
a
boat
and
paddling
well
out
to
sea
fetched
round
the
mouth
of
the
frantic
river
the
other
man
proved
to
be
stickless
chief
mate
and
so
he
went
back
and
fetched
his
comrades
bringing
their
weapons
but
leaving
their
horses
behind
as
it
happened
there
were
but
four
of
them
however
to
have
even
these
was
a
help
and
i
started
again
at
full
speed
for
my
home
for
the
men
must
follow
afoot
and
cross
our
river
high
up
on
the
moorland
this
took
them
a
long
way
round
and
the
track
was
rather
bad
to
find
and
the
sky
already
darkening
so
that
i
arrived
at
plovers
barrows
more
than
two
hours
before
them
but
they
had
done
a
sagacious
thing
which
was
well
worth
the
delay
for
by
hoisting
their
flag
upon
the
hill
they
fetched
the
two
watchmen
from
the
foreland
and
added
them
to
their
number
it
was
lucky
that
i
came
home
so
soon
for
i
found
the
house
in
a
great
commotion
and
all
the
women
trembling
when
i
asked
what
the
matter
was
lorna
who
seemed
the
most
selfpossessed
answered
that
it
was
all
her
fault
for
she
alone
had
frightened
them
and
this
in
the
following
manner
she
had
stolen
out
to
the
garden
towards
dusk
to
watch
some
favourite
hyacinths
just
pushing
up
like
a
babys
teeth
and
just
attracting
the
fatal
notice
of
a
great
housesnail
at
nighttime
lorna
at
last
had
discovered
the
glutton
and
was
bearing
him
off
in
triumph
to
the
tribunal
of
the
ducks
when
she
descried
two
glittering
eyes
glaring
at
her
steadfastly
from
the
elderbush
beyond
the
stream
the
elder
was
smoothing
its
wrinkled
leaves
being
at
least
two
months
behind
time
and
among
them
this
calm
cruel
face
appeared
and
she
knew
it
was
the
face
of
carver
doone
the
maiden
although
so
used
to
terror
as
she
told
me
once
before
lost
all
presence
of
mind
hereat
and
could
neither
shriek
nor
fly
but
only
gaze
as
if
bewitched
then
carver
doone
with
his
deadly
smile
gloating
upon
her
horror
lifted
his
long
gun
and
pointed
full
at
lornas
heart
in
vain
she
strove
to
turn
away
fright
had
stricken
her
stiff
as
stone
with
the
inborn
love
of
life
she
tried
to
cover
the
vital
part
wherein
the
winged
death
must
lodgefor
she
knew
carvers
certain
aimbut
her
hands
hung
numbed
and
heavy
in
nothing
but
her
eyes
was
life
with
no
sign
of
pity
in
his
face
no
quiver
of
relenting
but
a
wellpleased
grin
at
all
the
charming
palsy
of
his
victim
carver
doone
lowered
inch
by
inch
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
when
it
pointed
to
the
ground
between
her
delicate
arched
insteps
he
pulled
the
trigger
and
the
bullet
flung
the
mould
all
over
her
it
was
a
refinement
of
bullying
for
which
i
swore
to
god
that
night
upon
my
knees
in
secret
that
i
would
smite
down
carver
doone
or
else
he
should
smite
me
down
base
beast
what
largest
humanity
or
what
dreams
of
divinity
could
make
a
man
put
up
with
this
my
darling
the
loveliest
and
most
harmless
in
the
world
of
maidens
fell
away
on
a
bank
of
grass
and
wept
at
her
own
cowardice
and
trembled
and
wondered
where
i
was
and
what
i
would
think
of
this
good
god
what
could
i
think
of
it
she
overrated
my
slow
nature
to
admit
the
question
while
she
leaned
there
quite
unable
yet
to
save
herself
carver
came
to
the
brink
of
the
flood
which
alone
was
between
them
and
then
he
stroked
his
jetblack
beard
and
waited
for
lorna
to
begin
very
likely
he
thought
that
she
would
thank
him
for
his
kindness
to
her
but
she
was
now
recovering
the
power
of
her
nimble
limbs
and
ready
to
be
off
like
hope
and
wonder
at
her
own
cowardice
i
have
spared
you
this
time
he
said
in
his
deep
calm
voice
only
because
it
suits
my
plans
and
i
never
yield
to
temper
but
unless
you
come
back
tomorrow
pure
and
with
all
you
took
away
and
teach
me
to
destroy
that
fool
who
has
destroyed
himself
for
you
your
death
is
here
your
death
is
here
where
it
has
long
been
waiting
although
his
gun
was
empty
he
struck
the
breech
of
it
with
his
finger
and
then
he
turned
away
not
deigning
even
once
to
look
back
again
and
lorna
saw
his
giant
figure
striding
across
the
meadowland
as
if
the
ridds
were
nobodies
and
he
the
proper
owner
both
mother
and
i
were
greatly
hurt
at
hearing
of
this
insolence
for
we
had
owned
that
meadow
from
the
time
of
the
great
alfred
and
even
when
that
good
king
lay
in
the
isle
of
athelney
he
had
a
ridd
along
with
him
now
i
spoke
to
lorna
gently
seeing
how
much
she
had
been
tried
and
i
praised
her
for
her
courage
in
not
having
run
away
when
she
was
so
unable
and
my
darling
was
pleased
with
this
and
smiled
upon
me
for
saying
it
though
she
knew
right
well
that
in
this
matter
my
judgment
was
not
impartial
but
you
may
take
this
as
a
general
rule
that
a
woman
likes
praise
from
the
man
whom
she
loves
and
cannot
stop
always
to
balance
it
now
expecting
a
sharp
attack
that
nightwhen
jeremy
stickles
the
more
expected
after
the
words
of
carver
which
seemed
to
be
meant
to
mislead
uswe
prepared
a
great
quantity
of
knuckles
of
pork
and
a
ham
in
full
cut
and
a
fillet
of
hung
mutton
for
we
would
almost
surrender
rather
than
keep
our
garrison
hungry
and
all
our
men
were
exceedingly
brave
and
counted
their
rounds
of
the
house
in
halfpints
before
the
maidens
went
to
bed
lorna
made
a
remark
which
seemed
to
me
a
very
clever
one
and
then
i
wondered
how
on
earth
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
before
but
first
she
had
done
a
thing
which
i
could
not
in
the
least
approve
of
for
she
had
gone
up
to
my
mother
and
thrown
herself
into
her
arms
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
glen
doone
my
child
are
you
unhappy
here
mother
asked
her
very
gently
for
she
had
begun
to
regard
her
now
as
a
daughter
of
her
own
oh
no
too
happy
by
far
too
happy
mrs
ridd
i
never
knew
rest
or
peace
before
or
met
with
real
kindness
but
i
cannot
be
so
ungrateful
i
cannot
be
so
wicked
as
to
bring
you
all
into
deadly
peril
for
my
sake
alone
let
me
go
you
must
not
pay
this
great
price
for
my
happiness
dear
child
we
are
paying
no
price
at
all
replied
my
mother
embracing
her
we
are
not
threatened
for
your
sake
only
ask
john
he
will
tell
you
he
knows
every
bit
about
politics
and
this
is
a
political
matter
dear
mother
was
rather
proud
in
her
heart
as
well
as
terribly
frightened
at
the
importance
now
accruing
to
plovers
barrows
farm
and
she
often
declared
that
it
would
be
as
famous
in
history
as
the
rye
house
or
the
mealtub
or
even
the
great
black
box
in
which
she
was
a
firm
believer
and
even
my
knowledge
of
politics
could
not
move
her
upon
that
matter
such
things
had
happened
before
she
would
say
shaking
her
head
with
its
wisdom
and
why
might
they
not
happen
again
women
would
be
women
and
men
would
be
men
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
and
if
she
had
been
in
lucy
waters
place
she
would
keep
it
quiet
as
she
had
done
and
then
she
would
look
round
for
fear
lest
either
of
her
daughters
had
heard
her
but
now
can
you
give
me
any
reason
why
it
may
not
have
been
so
you
are
so
fearfully
positive
john
just
as
men
always
are
no
i
used
to
say
i
can
give
you
no
reason
why
it
may
not
have
been
so
mother
but
the
question
is
if
it
was
so
or
not
rather
than
what
it
might
have
been
and
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
proof
against
it
that
what
nine
men
of
every
ten
in
england
would
only
too
gladly
believe
if
true
is
nevertheless
kept
dark
from
them
there
you
are
again
john
mother
would
reply
all
about
men
and
not
a
single
word
about
women
if
you
had
any
argument
at
all
you
would
own
that
marriage
is
a
question
upon
which
women
are
the
best
judges
oh
i
would
groan
in
my
spirit
and
go
leaving
my
dearest
mother
quite
sure
that
now
at
last
she
must
have
convinced
me
but
if
mother
had
known
that
jeremy
stickles
was
working
against
the
black
box
and
its
issue
i
doubt
whether
he
would
have
fared
so
well
even
though
he
was
a
visitor
however
she
knew
that
something
was
doing
and
something
of
importance
and
she
trusted
in
god
for
the
rest
of
it
only
she
used
te
tell
me
very
seriously
of
an
evening
the
very
least
they
can
give
you
dear
john
is
a
coat
of
arms
be
sure
you
take
nothing
less
dear
and
the
farm
can
well
support
it
but
lo
i
have
left
lorna
ever
so
long
anxious
to
consult
me
upon
political
matters
she
came
to
me
and
her
eyes
alone
asked
a
hundred
questions
which
i
rather
had
answered
upon
her
lips
than
troubled
her
pretty
ears
with
them
therefore
i
told
her
nothing
at
all
save
that
the
attack
if
any
should
be
would
not
be
made
on
her
account
and
that
if
she
should
hear
by
any
chance
a
trifle
of
a
noise
in
the
night
she
was
to
wrap
the
clothes
around
her
and
shut
her
beautiful
eyes
again
on
no
account
whatever
she
did
was
she
to
go
to
the
window
she
liked
my
expression
about
her
eyes
and
promised
to
do
the
very
best
she
could
and
then
she
crept
so
very
close
that
i
needs
must
have
her
closer
and
with
her
head
on
my
breast
she
asked
cant
you
keep
out
of
this
fight
john
my
own
one
i
answered
gazing
through
the
long
black
lashes
at
the
depths
of
radiant
love
i
believe
there
will
be
nothing
but
what
there
is
i
must
see
out
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
john
it
is
only
a
fancy
of
mine
and
perhaps
it
is
not
worth
telling
let
us
have
it
dear
by
all
means
you
know
so
much
about
their
ways
what
i
believe
is
this
john
you
know
how
high
the
rivers
are
higher
than
ever
they
were
before
and
twice
as
high
you
have
told
me
i
believe
that
glen
doone
is
flooded
and
all
the
houses
under
water
you
little
witch
i
answered
what
a
fool
i
must
be
not
to
think
of
it
of
course
it
is
it
must
be
the
torrent
from
all
the
bagworthy
forest
and
all
the
valleys
above
it
and
the
great
drifts
in
the
glen
itself
never
could
have
outlet
down
my
famous
waterslide
the
valley
must
be
under
water
twenty
feet
at
least
well
if
ever
there
was
a
fool
i
am
he
for
not
having
thought
of
it
i
remember
once
before
said
lorna
reckoning
on
her
fingers
when
there
was
heavy
rain
all
through
the
autumn
and
winter
five
or
it
may
be
six
years
ago
the
river
came
down
with
such
a
rush
that
the
water
was
two
feet
deep
in
our
rooms
and
we
all
had
to
camp
by
the
cliffedge
but
you
think
that
the
floods
are
higher
now
i
believe
i
heard
you
say
john
i
dont
think
about
it
my
treasure
i
answered
you
may
trust
me
for
understanding
floods
after
our
work
at
tiverton
and
i
know
that
the
deluge
in
all
our
valleys
is
such
that
no
living
man
can
remember
neither
will
ever
behold
again
consider
three
months
of
snow
snow
snow
and
a
fortnight
of
rain
on
the
top
of
it
and
all
to
be
drained
in
a
few
days
away
and
great
barricades
of
ice
still
in
the
rivers
blocking
them
up
and
ponding
them
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
mistress
lorna
that
your
pretty
bower
is
six
feet
deep
well
my
bower
has
served
its
time
said
lorna
blushing
as
she
remembered
all
that
had
happened
there
and
my
bower
now
is
here
john
but
i
am
so
sorry
to
think
of
all
the
poor
women
flooded
out
of
their
houses
and
sheltering
in
the
snowdrifts
however
there
is
one
good
of
it
they
cannot
send
many
men
against
us
with
all
this
trouble
upon
them
you
are
right
i
replied
how
clever
you
are
and
that
is
why
there
were
only
three
to
cut
off
master
stickles
and
now
we
shall
beat
them
i
make
no
doubt
even
if
they
come
at
all
and
i
defy
them
to
fire
the
house
the
thatch
is
too
wet
for
burning
we
sent
all
the
women
to
bed
quite
early
except
gwenny
carfax
and
our
old
betty
these
two
we
allowed
to
stay
up
because
they
might
be
useful
to
us
if
they
could
keep
from
quarreling
for
my
part
i
had
little
fear
after
what
lorna
had
told
me
as
to
the
result
of
the
combat
it
was
not
likely
that
the
doones
could
bring
more
than
eight
or
ten
men
against
us
while
their
homes
were
in
such
danger
and
to
meet
these
we
had
eight
good
men
including
jeremy
and
myself
all
well
armed
and
resolute
besides
our
three
farmservants
and
the
parishclerk
and
the
shoemaker
these
five
could
not
be
trusted
much
for
any
valiant
conduct
although
they
spoke
very
confidently
over
their
cans
of
cider
neither
were
their
weapons
fitted
for
much
execution
unless
it
were
at
close
quarters
which
they
would
be
likely
to
avoid
bill
dadds
had
a
sickle
jem
slocombe
a
flail
the
cobbler
had
borrowed
the
constables
staff
for
the
constable
would
not
attend
because
there
was
no
warrant
and
the
parish
clerk
had
brought
his
pitchpipe
which
was
enough
to
break
any
mans
head
but
john
fry
of
course
had
his
blunderbuss
loaded
with
tintacks
and
marbles
and
more
likely
to
kill
the
man
who
discharged
it
than
any
other
person
but
we
knew
that
john
had
it
only
for
show
and
to
describe
its
qualities
now
it
was
my
great
desire
and
my
chiefest
hope
to
come
across
carver
doone
that
night
and
settle
the
score
between
us
not
by
any
shot
in
the
dark
but
by
a
conflict
man
to
man
as
yet
since
i
came
to
fullgrown
power
i
had
never
met
any
one
whom
i
could
not
play
teetotum
with
but
now
at
last
i
had
found
a
man
whose
strength
was
not
to
be
laughed
at
i
could
guess
it
in
his
face
i
could
tell
it
in
his
arms
i
could
see
it
in
his
stride
and
gait
which
more
than
all
the
rest
betray
the
substance
of
a
man
and
being
so
well
used
to
wrestling
and
to
judge
antagonists
i
felt
that
here
if
anywhere
i
had
found
my
match
therefore
i
was
not
content
to
abide
within
the
house
or
go
the
rounds
with
the
troopers
but
betook
myself
to
the
rick
yard
knowing
that
the
doones
were
likely
to
begin
their
onset
there
for
they
had
a
pleasant
custom
when
they
visited
farmhouses
of
lighting
themselves
towards
picking
up
anything
they
wanted
or
stabbing
the
inhabitants
by
first
creating
a
blaze
in
the
rick
yard
and
though
our
ricks
were
all
now
of
mere
straw
except
indeed
two
of
prime
cloverhay
and
although
on
the
top
they
were
so
wet
that
no
firebrands
might
hurt
them
i
was
both
unwilling
to
have
them
burned
and
fearful
that
they
might
kindle
if
well
roused
up
with
fire
upon
the
windward
side
by
the
bye
these
doones
had
got
the
worst
of
this
pleasant
trick
one
time
for
happening
to
fire
the
ricks
of
a
lonely
farm
called
yeanworthy
not
far
above
glenthorne
they
approached
the
house
to
get
peoples
goods
and
to
enjoy
their
terror
the
master
of
the
farm
was
lately
dead
and
had
left
inside
the
clockcase
loaded
the
great
long
gun
wherewith
he
had
used
to
sport
at
the
ducks
and
the
geese
on
the
shore
now
widow
fisher
took
out
this
gun
and
not
caring
much
what
became
of
her
for
she
had
loved
her
husband
dearly
she
laid
it
upon
the
windowsill
which
looked
upon
the
rickyard
and
she
backed
up
the
butt
with
a
chest
of
oak
drawers
and
she
opened
the
window
a
little
back
and
let
the
muzzle
out
on
the
slope
presently
five
or
six
fine
young
doones
came
dancing
a
reel
as
their
manner
was
betwixt
her
and
the
flaming
rick
upon
which
she
pulled
the
trigger
with
all
the
force
of
her
thumb
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
duckshot
went
out
with
a
blaze
on
the
dancers
you
may
suppose
what
their
dancing
was
and
their
reeling
how
changed
to
staggering
and
their
music
none
of
the
sweetest
one
of
them
fell
into
the
rick
and
was
burned
and
buried
in
a
ditch
next
day
but
the
others
were
set
upon
their
horses
and
carried
home
on
a
path
of
blood
and
strange
to
say
they
never
avenged
this
very
dreadful
injury
but
having
heard
that
a
woman
had
fired
this
desperate
shot
among
them
they
said
that
she
ought
to
be
a
doone
and
inquired
how
old
she
was
now
i
had
not
been
so
very
long
waiting
in
our
mowyard
with
my
best
gun
ready
and
a
big
club
by
me
before
a
heaviness
of
sleep
began
to
creep
upon
me
the
flow
of
water
was
in
my
ears
and
in
my
eyes
a
hazy
spreading
and
upon
my
brain
a
closure
as
a
cobbler
sews
a
vamp
up
so
i
leaned
back
in
the
cloverrick
and
the
dust
of
the
seed
and
the
smell
came
round
me
without
any
trouble
and
i
dozed
about
lorna
just
once
or
twice
and
what
she
had
said
about
newmown
hay
and
then
back
went
my
head
and
my
chin
went
up
and
if
ever
a
man
was
blest
with
slumber
down
it
came
upon
me
and
away
went
i
into
it
now
this
was
very
vile
of
me
and
against
all
good
resolutions
even
such
as
i
would
have
sworn
to
an
hour
ago
or
less
but
if
you
had
been
in
the
water
as
i
had
ay
and
had
long
fight
with
it
after
a
good
days
work
and
then
great
anxiety
afterwards
and
brainwork
which
is
not
fair
for
me
and
upon
that
a
stout
supper
mayhap
you
would
not
be
so
hard
on
my
sleep
though
you
felt
it
your
duty
to
wake
me
chapter
xlix
maiden
sentinels
are
best
it
was
not
likely
that
the
outlaws
would
attack
out
premises
until
some
time
after
the
moon
was
risen
because
it
would
be
too
dangerous
to
cross
the
flooded
valleys
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
but
for
this
consideration
i
must
have
striven
harder
against
the
stealthy
approach
of
slumber
but
even
so
it
was
very
foolish
to
abandon
watch
especially
in
such
as
i
who
sleep
like
any
dormouse
moreover
i
had
chosen
the
very
worst
place
in
the
world
for
such
employment
with
a
goodly
chance
of
awakening
in
a
bed
of
solid
fire
and
so
it
might
have
been
nay
it
must
have
been
but
for
lornas
vigilance
her
light
hand
upon
my
arm
awoke
me
not
too
readily
and
leaping
up
i
seized
my
club
and
prepared
to
knock
down
somebody
whos
that
i
cried
stand
back
i
say
and
let
me
have
fair
chance
at
you
are
you
going
to
knock
me
down
dear
john
replied
the
voice
i
loved
so
well
i
am
sure
i
should
never
get
up
again
after
one
blow
from
you
john
my
darling
is
it
you
i
cried
and
breaking
all
your
orders
come
back
into
the
house
at
once
and
nothing
on
your
head
dear
how
could
i
sleep
while
at
any
moment
you
might
be
killed
beneath
my
window
and
now
is
the
time
of
real
danger
for
men
can
see
to
travel
i
saw
at
once
the
truth
of
this
the
moon
was
high
and
clearly
lighting
all
the
watered
valleys
to
sleep
any
longer
might
be
death
not
only
to
myself
but
all
the
man
on
guard
at
the
back
of
the
house
is
fast
asleep
she
continued
gwenny
who
let
me
out
and
came
with
me
has
heard
him
snoring
for
two
hours
i
think
the
women
ought
to
be
the
watch
because
they
have
had
no
travelling
where
do
you
suppose
little
gwenny
is
surely
not
gone
to
glen
doone
i
was
not
sure
however
for
i
could
believe
almost
anything
of
the
cornish
maidens
hardihood
no
replied
lorna
although
she
wanted
even
to
do
that
but
of
course
i
would
not
hear
of
it
on
account
of
the
swollen
waters
but
she
is
perched
on
yonder
tree
which
commands
the
barrow
valley
she
says
that
they
are
almost
sure
to
cross
the
streamlet
there
and
now
it
is
so
wide
and
large
that
she
can
trace
it
in
the
moonlight
half
a
mile
beyond
her
if
they
cross
she
is
sure
to
see
them
and
in
good
time
to
let
us
know
what
a
shame
i
cried
that
the
men
should
sleep
and
the
maidens
be
the
soldiers
i
will
sit
in
that
tree
myself
and
send
little
gwenny
back
to
you
go
to
bed
my
best
and
dearest
i
will
take
good
care
not
to
sleep
again
please
not
to
send
me
away
dear
john
she
answered
very
mournfully
you
and
i
have
been
together
through
perils
worse
than
this
i
shall
only
be
more
timid
and
more
miserable
indoors
i
cannot
let
you
stay
here
i
said
it
is
altogether
impossible
do
you
suppose
that
i
can
fight
with
you
among
the
bullets
lorna
if
this
is
the
way
you
mean
to
take
it
we
had
better
go
both
to
the
appleroom
and
lock
ourselves
in
and
hide
under
the
tiles
and
let
them
burn
all
the
rest
of
the
premises
at
this
idea
lorna
laughed
as
i
could
see
by
the
moonlight
and
then
she
said
you
are
right
john
i
should
only
do
more
harm
than
good
and
of
all
things
i
hate
fighting
most
and
disobedience
next
to
it
therefore
i
will
go
indoors
although
i
cannot
go
to
bed
but
promise
me
one
thing
dearest
john
you
will
keep
yourself
out
of
the
way
now
wont
you
as
much
as
you
can
for
my
sake
of
that
you
may
be
quite
certain
lorna
i
will
shoot
them
all
through
the
hayricks
that
is
right
dear
she
answered
never
doubting
but
what
i
could
do
it
and
then
they
cannot
see
you
you
know
but
dont
think
of
climbing
that
tree
john
it
is
a
great
deal
too
dangerous
it
is
all
very
well
for
gwenny
she
has
no
bones
to
break
none
worth
breaking
you
mean
i
suppose
very
well
i
will
not
climb
the
tree
for
i
should
defeat
my
own
purpose
i
fear
being
such
a
conspicuous
object
now
go
indoors
darling
without
more
words
the
more
you
linger
the
more
i
shall
keep
you
she
laughed
her
own
bright
laugh
at
this
and
only
said
god
keep
you
love
and
then
away
she
tripped
across
the
yard
with
the
step
i
loved
to
watch
so
and
thereupon
i
shouldered
arms
and
resolved
to
tramp
till
morning
for
i
was
vexed
at
my
own
neglect
and
that
lorna
should
have
to
right
it
but
before
i
had
been
long
on
duty
making
the
round
of
the
ricks
and
stables
and
hailing
gwenny
now
and
then
from
the
bottom
of
her
tree
a
short
wide
figure
stole
towards
me
in
and
out
the
shadows
and
i
saw
that
it
was
no
other
than
the
little
maid
herself
and
that
she
bore
some
tidings
ten
on
em
crossed
the
watter
down
yonner
said
gwenny
putting
her
hand
to
her
mouth
and
seeming
to
regard
it
as
good
news
rather
than
otherwise
be
arl
craping
up
by
hedgerow
now
i
could
shutt
dree
on
em
from
the
bar
of
the
gate
if
so
be
i
had
your
goon
young
man
there
is
no
time
to
lose
gwenny
run
to
the
house
and
fetch
master
stickles
and
all
the
men
while
i
stay
here
and
watch
the
rickyard
perhaps
i
was
wrong
in
heeding
the
ricks
at
such
a
time
as
that
especially
as
only
the
clover
was
of
much
importance
but
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
sort
of
triumph
that
they
should
be
even
able
to
boast
of
having
fired
our
mowyard
therefore
i
stood
in
a
nick
of
the
clover
whence
we
had
cut
some
trusses
with
my
club
in
hand
and
gun
close
by
the
robbers
rode
into
our
yard
as
coolly
as
if
they
had
been
invited
having
lifted
the
gate
from
the
hinges
first
on
account
of
its
being
fastened
then
they
actually
opened
our
stabledoors
and
turned
our
honest
horses
out
and
put
their
own
rogues
in
the
place
of
them
at
this
my
breath
was
quite
taken
away
for
we
think
so
much
of
our
horses
by
this
time
i
could
see
our
troopers
waiting
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
round
the
corner
from
where
the
doones
were
and
expecting
the
order
to
fire
but
jeremy
stickles
very
wisely
kept
them
in
readiness
until
the
enemy
should
advance
upon
them
two
of
you
lazy
fellows
go
it
was
the
deep
voice
of
carver
doone
and
make
us
a
light
to
cut
their
throats
by
only
one
thing
once
again
if
any
man
touches
lorna
i
will
stab
him
where
he
stands
she
belongs
to
me
there
are
two
other
young
damsels
here
whom
you
may
take
away
if
you
please
and
the
mother
i
hear
is
still
comely
now
for
our
rights
we
have
borne
too
long
the
insolence
of
these
yokels
kill
every
man
and
every
child
and
burn
the
cursed
place
down
as
he
spoke
thus
blasphemously
i
set
my
gun
against
his
breast
and
by
the
light
buckled
from
his
belt
i
saw
the
little
sight
of
brass
gleaming
alike
upon
either
side
and
the
sleek
round
barrel
glimmering
the
aim
was
sure
as
death
itself
if
i
only
drew
the
trigger
which
went
very
lighily
carver
doone
would
breathe
no
more
and
yetwill
you
believe
mei
could
not
pull
the
trigger
would
to
god
that
i
had
done
so
for
i
never
had
taken
human
life
neither
done
bodily
harm
to
man
beyond
the
little
bruises
and
the
trifling
aches
and
pains
which
follow
a
good
and
honest
bout
in
the
wrestling
ring
therefore
i
dropped
my
carbine
and
grasped
again
my
club
which
seemed
a
more
straightforward
implement
presently
two
young
men
came
towards
me
bearing
brands
of
resined
hemp
kindled
from
carvers
lamp
the
foremost
of
them
set
his
torch
to
the
rick
within
a
yard
of
me
and
smoke
concealing
me
from
him
i
struck
him
with
a
backhanded
blow
on
the
elbow
as
he
bent
it
and
i
heard
the
bone
of
his
arm
break
as
clearly
as
ever
i
heard
a
twig
snap
with
a
roar
of
pain
he
fell
on
the
ground
and
his
torch
dropped
there
and
singed
him
the
other
man
stood
amazed
at
this
not
having
yet
gained
sight
of
me
till
i
caught
his
firebrand
from
his
hand
and
struck
it
into
his
countenance
with
that
he
leaped
at
me
but
i
caught
him
in
a
manner
learned
from
early
wrestling
and
snapped
his
collarbone
as
i
laid
him
upon
the
top
of
his
comrade
this
little
success
so
encouraged
me
that
i
was
half
inclined
to
advance
and
challenge
carver
doone
to
meet
me
but
i
bore
in
mind
that
he
would
be
apt
to
shoot
me
without
ceremony
and
what
is
the
utmost
of
human
strength
against
the
power
of
powder
moreover
i
remembered
my
promise
to
sweet
lorna
and
who
would
be
left
to
defend
her
if
the
rogues
got
rid
of
me
while
i
was
hesitating
thus
for
i
always
continue
to
hesitate
except
in
actual
conflict
a
blaze
of
fire
lit
up
the
house
and
brown
smoke
hung
around
it
six
of
our
men
had
let
go
at
the
doones
by
jeremy
stickles
order
as
the
villains
came
swaggering
down
in
the
moonlight
ready
for
rape
or
murder
two
of
them
fell
and
the
rest
hung
back
to
think
at
their
leisure
what
this
was
they
were
not
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
it
was
neither
just
nor
courteous
being
unable
any
longer
to
contain
myself
as
i
thought
of
lornas
excitement
at
all
this
noise
of
firing
i
came
across
the
yard
expecting
whether
they
would
shoot
at
me
however
no
one
shot
at
me
and
i
went
up
to
carver
doone
whom
i
knew
by
his
size
in
the
moonlight
and
i
took
him
by
the
beard
and
said
do
you
call
yourself
a
man
for
a
moment
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
could
not
answer
none
had
ever
dared
i
suppose
to
look
at
him
in
that
way
and
he
saw
that
he
had
met
his
equal
or
perhaps
his
master
and
then
he
tried
a
pistol
at
me
but
i
was
too
quick
for
him
now
carver
doone
take
warning
i
said
to
him
very
soberly
you
have
shown
yourself
a
fool
by
your
contempt
of
me
i
may
not
be
your
match
in
craft
but
i
am
in
manhood
you
are
a
despicable
villain
lie
low
in
your
native
muck
and
with
that
word
i
laid
him
flat
upon
his
back
in
our
strawyard
by
a
trick
of
the
inner
heel
which
he
could
not
have
resisted
though
his
strength
had
been
twice
as
great
as
mine
unless
he
were
a
wrestler
seeing
him
down
the
others
ran
though
one
of
them
made
a
shot
at
me
and
some
of
them
got
their
horses
before
our
men
came
up
and
some
went
away
without
them
and
among
these
last
was
captain
carver
who
arose
while
i
was
feeling
myself
for
i
had
a
little
wound
and
strode
away
with
a
train
of
curses
enough
to
poison
the
light
of
the
moon
we
gained
six
very
good
horses
by
this
attempted
rapine
as
well
as
two
young
prisoners
whom
i
had
smitten
by
the
cloverrick
and
two
dead
doones
were
left
behind
whom
as
we
buried
them
in
the
churchyard
without
any
service
over
them
i
for
my
part
was
most
thankful
that
i
had
not
killed
for
to
have
the
life
of
a
fellowman
laid
upon
ones
consciencedeserved
he
his
death
or
deserved
it
notis
to
my
sense
of
right
and
wrong
the
heaviest
of
all
burdens
and
the
one
that
wears
most
deeply
inwards
with
the
dwelling
of
the
mind
on
this
view
and
on
that
of
it
i
was
inclined
to
pursue
the
enemy
and
try
to
capture
more
of
them
but
jeremy
stickles
would
not
allow
it
for
he
said
that
all
the
advantage
would
be
upon
their
side
if
we
went
hurrying
after
them
with
only
the
moon
to
guide
us
and
who
could
tell
but
what
there
might
be
another
band
of
them
ready
to
fall
upon
the
house
and
burn
it
and
seize
the
women
if
we
left
them
unprotected
when
he
put
the
case
thus
i
was
glad
enough
to
abide
by
his
decision
and
one
thing
was
quite
certain
that
the
doones
had
never
before
received
so
rude
a
shock
and
so
violent
a
blow
to
their
supremacy
since
first
they
had
built
up
their
power
and
become
the
lords
of
exmoor
i
knew
that
carver
doone
would
gnash
those
mighty
teeth
of
his
and
curse
the
men
around
him
for
the
blunder
which
was
in
truth
his
own
of
overconfidence
and
carelessness
and
at
the
same
time
all
the
rest
would
feel
that
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
while
old
sir
ensor
was
alive
and
that
it
was
caused
by
nothing
short
of
gross
mismanagement
i
scarcely
know
who
made
the
greatest
fuss
about
my
little
wound
mother
or
annie
or
lorna
i
was
heartily
ashamed
to
be
so
treated
like
a
milksop
but
most
unluckily
it
had
been
impossible
to
hide
it
for
the
ball
had
cut
along
my
temple
just
above
the
eyebrow
and
being
fired
so
near
at
hand
the
powder
too
had
scarred
me
therefore
it
seemed
a
great
deal
worse
than
it
really
was
and
the
sponging
and
the
plastering
and
the
sobbing
and
the
moaning
made
me
quite
ashamed
to
look
master
stickles
in
the
face
however
at
last
i
persuaded
them
that
i
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
the
ghost
that
night
and
then
they
all
fell
to
and
thanked
god
with
an
emphasis
quite
unknown
in
church
and
hereupon
master
stickles
said
in
his
free
and
easy
manner
for
no
one
courted
his
observation
that
i
was
the
luckiest
of
all
mortals
in
having
a
mother
and
a
sister
and
a
sweetheart
to
make
much
of
me
for
his
part
he
said
he
was
just
as
well
off
in
not
having
any
to
care
for
him
for
now
he
might
go
and
get
shot
or
stabbed
or
knocked
on
the
head
at
his
pleasure
without
any
one
being
offended
i
made
bold
upon
this
to
ask
him
what
was
become
of
his
wife
for
i
had
heard
him
speak
of
having
one
he
said
that
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
and
perhaps
i
should
be
like
him
some
day
that
lorna
should
hear
such
sentiments
was
very
grievous
to
me
but
she
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
which
proved
her
contempt
for
all
such
ideas
and
lest
anything
still
more
unfit
might
be
said
i
dismissed
the
question
but
master
stickles
told
me
afterwards
when
there
was
no
one
with
us
to
have
no
faith
in
any
woman
whatever
she
might
seem
to
be
for
he
assured
me
that
now
he
possessed
very
large
experience
for
so
small
a
matter
being
thoroughly
acquainted
with
women
of
every
class
from
ladies
of
the
highest
blood
to
bonarobas
and
peasants
wives
and
that
they
all
might
be
divided
into
three
heads
and
no
more
that
is
to
say
as
follows
first
the
very
hot
and
passionate
who
were
only
contemptible
second
the
cold
and
indifferent
who
were
simply
odious
and
third
the
mixture
of
the
other
two
who
had
the
bad
qualities
of
both
as
for
reason
none
of
them
had
it
it
was
like
a
sealed
book
to
them
which
if
they
ever
tried
to
open
they
began
at
the
back
of
the
cover
now
i
did
not
like
to
hear
such
things
and
to
me
they
appeared
to
be
insolent
as
well
as
narrowminded
for
if
you
came
to
that
why
might
not
men
as
well
as
women
be
divided
into
the
same
three
classes
and
be
pronounced
upon
by
women
as
beings
even
more
devoid
than
their
gentle
judges
of
reason
moreover
i
knew
both
from
my
own
sense
and
from
the
greatest
of
all
great
poets
that
there
are
and
always
have
been
plenty
of
women
good
and
gentle
warmhearted
loving
and
lovable
very
keen
moreover
at
seeing
the
right
be
it
by
reason
or
otherwise
and
upon
the
whole
i
prefer
them
much
to
the
people
of
my
own
sex
as
goodness
of
heart
is
more
important
than
to
show
good
reason
for
having
it
and
so
i
said
to
jeremy
you
have
been
illtreated
perhaps
master
stickles
by
some
woman
or
other
ah
that
have
i
he
replied
with
an
oath
and
the
last
on
earth
who
should
serve
me
so
the
woman
who
was
my
wife
a
woman
whom
i
never
struck
never
wronged
in
any
way
never
even
let
her
know
that
i
like
another
better
and
yet
when
i
was
at
berwick
last
with
the
regiment
on
guard
there
against
those
vile
mosstroopers
what
does
that
woman
do
but
fly
in
the
face
of
all
authority
and
of
my
especial
business
by
running
away
herself
with
the
biggest
of
all
mosstroopers
not
that
i
cared
a
groat
about
her
and
i
wish
the
fool
well
rid
of
her
but
the
insolence
of
the
thing
was
such
that
everybody
laughed
at
me
and
back
i
went
to
london
losing
a
far
better
and
safer
job
than
this
and
all
through
her
come
lets
have
another
onion
master
stickless
view
of
the
matter
was
so
entirely
unromantic
that
i
scarcely
wondered
at
mistress
stickles
for
having
run
away
from
him
to
an
adventurous
mosstrooper
for
nine
women
out
of
ten
must
have
some
kind
of
romance
or
other
to
make
their
lives
endurable
and
when
their
love
has
lost
this
attractive
element
this
soft
dewfog
if
such
it
be
the
love
itself
is
apt
to
languish
unless
its
bloom
be
well
replaced
by
the
budding
hopes
of
children
now
master
stickles
neither
had
nor
wished
to
have
any
children
without
waiting
for
any
warrant
only
saying
something
about
captus
in
flagrante
delictoif
that
be
the
way
to
spell
itstickles
sent
our
prisoners
off
bound
and
looking
miserable
to
the
jail
at
taunton
i
was
desirous
to
let
them
go
free
if
they
would
promise
amendment
but
although
i
had
taken
them
and
surely
therefore
had
every
right
to
let
them
go
again
master
stickles
said
not
so
he
assured
me
that
it
was
a
matter
of
public
polity
and
of
course
not
knowing
what
he
meant
i
could
not
contradict
him
but
thought
that
surely
my
private
rights
ought
to
be
respected
for
if
i
throw
a
man
in
wrestling
i
expect
to
get
his
stakes
and
if
i
take
a
man
prisonerwhy
he
ought
in
common
justice
to
belong
to
me
and
i
have
a
good
right
to
let
him
go
if
i
think
proper
to
do
so
however
master
stickles
said
that
i
was
quite
benighted
and
knew
nothing
of
the
constitution
which
was
the
very
thing
i
knew
beyond
any
man
in
our
parish
nevertheless
it
was
not
for
me
to
contradict
a
commissioner
and
therefore
i
let
my
prisoners
go
and
wished
them
a
happy
deliverance
stickles
replied
with
a
merry
grin
that
if
ever
they
got
it
it
would
be
a
jail
deliverance
and
the
bliss
of
dancing
and
he
laid
his
hand
to
his
throat
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
me
most
uncourteous
however
his
foresight
proved
too
correct
for
both
those
poor
fellows
were
executed
soon
after
the
next
assizes
lorna
had
done
her
very
best
to
earn
another
chance
for
them
even
going
down
on
her
knees
to
that
common
jeremy
and
pleading
with
great
tears
for
them
however
although
much
moved
by
her
he
vowed
that
he
durst
do
nothing
else
to
set
them
free
was
more
than
his
own
life
was
worth
for
all
the
country
knew
by
this
time
that
two
captive
doones
were
roped
to
the
ciderpress
at
plovers
barrows
annie
bound
the
broken
arm
of
the
one
whom
i
had
knocked
down
with
the
club
and
i
myself
supported
it
and
then
she
washed
and
rubbed
with
lard
the
face
of
the
other
poor
fellow
which
the
torch
had
injured
and
i
fetched
back
his
collarbone
to
the
best
of
my
ability
for
before
any
surgeon
could
arrive
they
were
off
with
a
wellarmed
escort
that
day
we
were
reinforced
so
strongly
from
the
stations
along
the
coast
even
as
far
as
minehead
that
we
not
only
feared
no
further
attack
but
even
talked
of
assaulting
glen
doone
without
waiting
for
the
trainbands
however
i
thought
that
it
would
be
mean
to
take
advantage
of
the
enemy
in
the
thick
of
the
floods
and
confusion
and
several
of
the
others
thought
so
too
and
did
not
like
fighting
in
water
therefore
it
was
resolved
to
wait
and
keep
a
watch
upon
the
valley
and
let
the
floods
go
down
again
chapter
l
a
merry
meeting
a
sad
one
now
the
business
i
had
most
at
heart
as
every
one
knows
by
this
time
was
to
marry
lorna
as
soon
as
might
be
if
she
had
no
objection
and
then
to
work
the
farm
so
well
as
to
nourish
all
our
family
and
herein
i
saw
no
difficulty
for
annie
would
soon
be
off
our
hands
and
somebody
might
come
and
take
a
fancy
to
little
lizzie
who
was
growing
up
very
nicely
now
though
not
so
fine
as
annie
moreover
we
were
almost
sure
to
have
great
store
of
hay
and
corn
after
so
much
snow
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
old
saying
a
foot
deep
of
rain
will
kill
hay
and
grain
but
three
feet
of
snow
will
make
them
come
mo
and
although
it
was
too
true
that
we
had
lost
a
many
cattle
yet
even
so
we
had
not
lost
money
for
the
few
remaining
fetched
such
prices
as
were
never
known
before
and
though
we
grumbled
with
all
our
hearts
and
really
believed
at
one
time
that
starvation
was
upon
us
i
doubt
whether
on
the
whole
we
were
not
the
fatter
and
the
richer
and
the
wiser
for
that
winter
and
i
might
have
said
the
happier
except
for
the
sorrow
which
we
felt
at
the
failures
among
our
neighbours
the
snowes
lost
every
sheep
they
had
and
nine
out
of
ten
horned
cattle
and
poor
jasper
kebby
would
have
been
forced
to
throw
up
the
lease
of
his
farm
and
perhaps
to
go
to
prison
but
for
the
help
we
gave
him
however
my
dear
mother
would
have
it
that
lorna
was
too
young
as
yet
to
think
of
being
married
and
indeed
i
myself
was
compelled
to
admit
that
her
form
was
becoming
more
perfect
and
lovely
though
i
had
not
thought
it
possible
and
another
difficulty
was
that
as
we
had
all
been
protestants
from
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
the
maiden
must
be
converted
first
and
taught
to
hate
all
papists
now
lorna
had
not
the
smallest
idea
of
ever
being
converted
she
said
that
she
loved
me
truly
but
wanted
not
to
convert
me
and
if
i
loved
her
equally
why
should
i
wish
to
convert
her
with
this
i
was
tolerably
content
not
seeing
so
very
much
difference
between
a
creed
and
a
credo
and
believing
god
to
be
our
father
in
latin
as
well
as
english
moreover
my
darling
knew
but
little
of
the
popish
wayswhether
excellent
or
otherwiseinasmuch
as
the
doones
though
they
stole
their
houses
or
at
least
the
joiners
work
had
never
been
tempted
enough
by
the
devil
to
steal
either
church
or
chapel
lorna
came
to
our
little
church
when
parson
bowden
reappeared
after
the
snow
was
over
and
she
said
that
all
was
very
nice
and
very
like
what
she
had
seen
in
the
time
of
her
aunt
sabina
when
they
went
far
away
to
the
little
chapel
with
a
shilling
in
their
gloves
it
made
the
tears
come
into
her
eyes
by
the
force
of
memory
when
parson
bowden
did
the
things
not
so
gracefully
nor
so
well
yet
with
pleasant
imitation
of
her
old
priests
sacred
rites
he
is
a
worthy
man
she
said
being
used
to
talk
in
the
service
time
and
my
mother
was
obliged
to
cough
i
like
him
very
much
indeed
but
i
wish
he
would
let
me
put
his
things
the
right
way
on
his
shoulders
everybody
in
our
parish
who
could
walk
at
all
or
hire
a
boy
and
a
wheelbarrow
ay
and
half
the
folk
from
countisbury
brendon
and
even
lynmouth
was
and
were
to
be
found
that
sunday
in
our
little
church
of
oare
people
who
would
not
come
anigh
us
when
the
doones
were
threatening
with
carbine
and
with
firebrand
flocked
in
their
very
best
clothes
to
see
a
lady
doone
go
to
church
now
all
this
came
of
that
vile
john
fry
i
knew
it
as
well
as
possible
his
tongue
was
worse
than
the
clacker
of
a
charityschool
bell
or
the
ladle
in
the
fryingpan
when
the
bees
are
swarming
however
lorna
was
not
troubled
partly
because
of
her
natural
dignity
and
gentleness
partly
because
she
never
dreamed
that
the
people
were
come
to
look
at
her
but
when
we
came
to
the
psalms
of
the
day
with
some
vague
sense
of
being
stared
at
more
than
ought
to
be
she
dropped
the
heavy
black
lace
fringing
of
the
velvet
hat
she
wore
and
concealed
from
the
congregation
all
except
her
bright
red
lips
and
the
oval
snowdrift
of
her
chin
i
touched
her
hand
and
she
pressed
mine
and
we
felt
that
we
were
close
together
and
god
saw
no
harm
in
it
as
for
parson
bowden
as
worthy
a
man
as
ever
lived
and
one
who
could
shoot
flying
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
doing
without
the
clerk
to
help
him
he
had
borne
it
very
well
indeed
when
i
returned
from
london
but
to
see
a
live
doone
in
his
church
and
a
lady
doone
and
a
lovely
doone
moreover
one
engaged
to
me
upon
whom
he
almost
looked
as
the
squire
of
his
parish
although
not
rightly
an
armiger
and
to
feel
that
this
lovely
doone
was
a
papist
and
therefore
of
higher
religionas
all
our
parsons
thinkand
that
she
knew
exactly
how
he
ought
to
do
all
the
service
of
which
he
himself
knew
little
i
wish
to
express
my
firm
belief
that
all
these
things
together
turned
parson
bowdens
head
a
little
and
made
him
look
to
me
for
orders
my
mother
the
very
best
of
women
was
as
i
could
well
perceive
a
little
annoyed
and
vexed
with
things
for
this
particular
occasion
she
had
procured
from
dulverton
by
special
message
to
ruth
huckaback
whereof
more
anon
a
headdress
with
a
feather
never
seen
before
upon
exmoor
to
the
best
of
every
ones
knowledge
it
came
from
a
bird
called
a
flaming
somethinga
flaming
oh
or
a
flaming
ah
i
will
not
be
positivebut
i
can
assure
you
that
it
did
flame
and
dear
mother
had
no
other
thought
but
that
all
the
congregation
would
neither
see
nor
think
of
any
other
mortal
thing
or
immortal
even
to
the
very
end
of
the
sermon
herein
she
was
so
disappointed
that
no
sooner
did
she
get
home
but
upstairs
she
went
at
speed
not
even
stopping
at
the
mirror
in
our
little
parlour
and
flung
the
whole
thing
into
a
cupboard
as
i
knew
by
the
bang
of
the
door
having
eased
the
lock
for
her
lately
lorna
saw
there
was
something
wrong
and
she
looked
at
annie
and
lizzie
as
more
likely
to
understand
it
with
her
former
timid
glance
which
i
knew
so
well
and
which
had
first
enslaved
me
i
know
not
what
ails
mother
said
annie
who
looked
very
beautiful
with
lilac
lutestring
ribbons
which
i
saw
the
snowe
girls
envying
but
she
has
not
attended
to
one
of
the
prayers
nor
said
amen
all
the
morning
never
fear
darling
lorna
it
is
nothing
about
you
it
is
something
about
our
john
i
am
sure
for
she
never
worries
herself
very
much
about
anybody
but
him
and
here
annie
made
a
look
at
me
such
as
i
had
had
five
hundred
of
you
keep
your
opinions
to
yourself
i
replied
because
i
knew
the
dear
and
her
little
bits
of
jealousy
it
happens
that
you
are
quite
wrong
this
time
lorna
come
with
me
my
darling
oh
yes
lorna
go
with
him
cried
lizzie
dropping
her
lip
in
a
way
which
you
must
see
to
know
its
meaning
john
wants
nobody
now
but
you
and
none
can
find
fault
with
his
taste
dear
you
little
fool
i
should
think
not
i
answered
very
rudely
for
betwixt
the
lot
of
them
my
lornas
eyelashes
were
quivering
now
dearest
angel
come
with
me
and
snap
your
hands
at
the
whole
of
them
my
angel
did
come
with
a
sigh
and
then
with
a
smile
when
we
were
alone
but
without
any
unangelic
attempt
at
snapping
her
sweet
white
fingers
these
little
things
are
enough
to
show
that
while
every
one
so
admired
lorna
and
so
kindly
took
to
her
still
there
would
just
now
and
then
be
petty
and
paltry
flashes
of
jealousy
concerning
her
and
perhaps
it
could
not
be
otherwise
among
so
many
women
however
we
were
always
doubly
kind
to
her
afterwards
and
although
her
mind
was
so
sensitive
and
quick
that
she
must
have
suffered
she
never
allowed
us
to
perceive
it
nor
lowered
herself
by
resenting
it
possibly
i
may
have
mentioned
that
little
ruth
huckaback
had
been
asked
and
had
even
promised
to
spend
her
christmas
with
us
and
this
was
the
more
desirable
because
she
had
left
us
through
some
offence
or
sorrow
about
things
said
of
her
now
my
dear
mother
being
the
kindest
and
besthearted
of
all
women
could
not
bear
that
poor
dear
ruth
who
would
some
day
have
such
a
fortune
should
be
entirely
lost
to
us
it
is
our
duty
my
dear
children
she
said
more
than
once
about
it
to
forgive
and
forget
as
freely
as
we
hope
to
have
it
done
to
us
if
dear
little
ruth
has
not
behaved
quite
as
we
might
have
expected
great
allowance
should
be
made
for
a
girl
with
so
much
money
designing
people
get
hold
of
her
and
flatter
her
and
coax
her
to
obtain
a
base
influence
over
her
so
that
when
she
falls
among
simple
folk
who
speak
the
honest
truth
of
her
no
wonder
the
poor
child
is
vexed
and
gives
herself
airs
and
so
on
ruth
can
be
very
useful
to
us
in
a
number
of
little
ways
and
i
consider
it
quite
a
duty
to
pardon
her
freak
of
petulance
now
one
of
the
little
ways
in
which
ruth
had
been
very
useful
was
the
purchase
of
the
scarlet
feathers
of
the
flaming
bird
and
now
that
the
house
was
quite
safe
from
attack
and
the
mark
on
my
forehead
was
healing
i
was
begged
over
and
over
again
to
go
and
see
ruth
and
make
all
things
straight
and
pay
for
the
gorgeous
plumage
this
last
i
was
very
desirous
to
do
that
i
might
know
the
price
of
it
having
made
a
small
bet
on
the
subject
with
annie
and
having
held
counsel
with
myself
whether
or
not
it
were
possible
to
get
something
of
the
kind
for
lorna
of
still
more
distinguished
appearance
of
course
she
could
not
wear
scarlet
as
yet
even
if
i
had
wished
it
but
i
believed
that
people
of
fashion
often
wore
purple
for
mourning
purple
too
was
the
royal
colour
and
lorna
was
by
right
a
queen
therefore
i
was
quite
resolved
to
ransack
uncle
reubens
stores
in
search
of
some
bright
purple
bird
if
nature
had
kindly
provided
one
all
this
however
i
kept
to
myself
intending
to
trust
ruth
huckaback
and
no
one
else
in
the
matter
and
so
one
beautiful
spring
morning
when
all
the
earth
was
kissed
with
scent
and
all
the
air
caressed
with
song
up
the
lane
i
stoutly
rode
well
armed
and
well
provided
now
though
it
is
part
of
my
life
to
heed
it
is
no
part
of
my
tale
to
tell
how
the
wheat
was
coming
on
i
reckon
that
you
who
read
this
story
after
i
am
dead
and
gone
and
before
that
none
shall
read
it
will
say
tush
what
is
his
wheat
to
us
we
are
not
wheat
we
are
human
beings
and
all
we
care
for
is
human
doings
this
may
be
very
good
argument
and
in
the
main
i
believe
that
it
is
so
nevertheless
if
a
man
is
to
tell
only
what
he
thought
and
did
and
not
what
came
around
him
he
must
not
mention
his
own
clothes
which
his
father
and
mother
bought
for
him
and
more
than
my
own
clothes
to
me
ay
and
as
much
as
my
own
skin
are
the
works
of
nature
round
about
whereof
a
man
is
the
smallest
and
now
i
will
tell
you
although
most
likely
only
to
be
laughed
at
because
i
cannot
put
it
in
the
style
of
mr
drydenwhom
to
compare
to
shakespeare
but
if
once
i
begin
upon
that
you
will
never
hear
the
last
of
menevertheless
i
will
tell
you
this
not
wishing
to
be
rude
but
only
just
because
i
know
it
the
more
a
man
can
fling
his
arms
so
to
say
round
natures
neck
the
more
he
can
upon
her
bosom
like
an
infant
lie
and
suckthe
more
that
man
shall
earn
the
trust
and
love
of
all
his
fellow
men
in
this
matter
is
no
jealousy
when
the
man
is
dead
because
thereafter
all
others
know
how
much
of
the
milk
be
had
and
he
can
suck
no
longer
and
they
value
him
accordingly
for
the
nourishment
he
is
to
them
even
as
when
we
keep
a
roaster
of
the
suckingpigs
we
choose
and
praise
at
table
most
the
favourite
of
its
mother
fifty
times
have
i
seen
this
and
smiled
and
praised
our
peoples
taste
and
offered
them
more
of
the
vitals
now
here
am
i
upon
shakespeare
who
died
of
his
own
fruition
at
the
age
of
fiftytwo
yet
lived
more
than
fifty
thousand
men
within
his
little
span
of
life
when
all
the
while
i
ought
to
be
riding
as
hard
as
i
can
to
dulverton
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
could
not
ride
hard
being
held
at
every
turn
and
often
without
any
turn
at
all
by
the
beauty
of
things
around
me
these
things
grow
upon
a
man
if
once
he
stops
to
notice
them
it
wanted
yet
two
hours
to
noon
when
i
came
to
master
huckabacks
door
and
struck
the
panels
smartly
knowing
nothing
of
their
manners
only
that
people
in
a
town
could
not
be
expected
to
entertain
as
we
do
in
farmhouses
having
moreover
keen
expectation
of
master
huckabacks
avarice
i
had
brought
some
stuff
to
eat
made
by
annie
and
packed
by
lorna
and
requiring
no
thinking
about
it
ruth
herself
came
and
let
me
in
blushing
very
heartily
for
which
colour
i
praised
her
health
and
my
praises
heightened
it
that
little
thing
had
lovely
eyes
and
could
be
trusted
thoroughly
i
do
like
an
obstinate
little
woman
when
she
is
sure
that
she
is
right
and
indeed
if
love
had
never
sped
me
straight
to
the
heart
of
lorna
compared
to
whom
ruth
was
no
more
than
the
thief
is
to
the
candle
who
knows
but
what
i
might
have
yielded
to
the
law
of
nature
that
thorough
trimmer
of
balances
and
verified
the
proverb
that
the
giant
loves
the
dwarf
i
take
the
privilege
mistress
ruth
of
saluting
you
according
to
kinship
and
the
ordering
of
the
canons
and
therewith
i
bussed
her
well
and
put
my
arm
around
her
waist
being
so
terribly
restricted
in
the
matter
of
lorna
and
knowing
the
use
of
practice
not
that
i
had
any
warmthall
that
was
darling
lornasonly
out
of
pure
gallantry
and
my
knowledge
of
london
fashions
ruth
blushed
to
such
a
pitch
at
this
and
looked
up
at
me
with
such
a
gleam
as
if
i
must
have
my
own
way
that
all
my
love
of
kissing
sunk
and
i
felt
that
i
was
wronging
her
only
my
mother
had
told
me
when
the
girls
were
out
of
the
way
to
do
all
i
could
to
please
darling
ruth
and
i
had
gone
about
it
accordingly
now
ruth
as
yet
had
never
heard
a
word
about
dear
lorna
and
when
she
led
me
into
the
kitchen
where
everything
looked
beautiful
and
told
me
not
to
mind
for
a
moment
about
the
scrubbing
of
my
boots
because
she
would
only
be
too
glad
to
clean
it
all
up
after
me
and
told
me
how
glad
she
was
to
see
me
blushing
more
at
every
word
and
recalling
some
of
them
and
stooping
down
for
pots
and
pans
when
i
looked
at
her
too
ruddilyall
these
things
came
upon
me
so
without
any
legal
notice
that
i
could
only
look
at
ruth
and
think
how
very
good
she
was
and
how
bright
her
handles
were
and
wonder
if
i
had
wronged
her
once
or
twice
i
beganthis
i
say
upon
my
honourto
endeavour
to
explain
exactly
how
we
were
at
plovers
barrows
how
we
all
had
been
bound
to
fight
and
had
defeated
the
enemy
keeping
their
queen
amongst
us
but
ruth
would
make
some
great
mistake
between
lorna
and
gwenny
carfax
and
gave
me
no
chance
to
set
her
aright
and
cared
about
nothing
much
except
some
news
of
sally
snowe
what
could
i
do
with
this
little
thing
all
my
sense
of
modesty
and
value
for
my
dinner
were
against
my
overpressing
all
the
graceful
hints
i
had
given
about
lorna
ruth
was
just
a
girl
of
that
sort
who
will
not
believe
one
word
except
from
her
own
seeing
not
so
much
from
any
doubt
as
from
the
practice
of
using
eyes
which
have
been
in
business
i
asked
cousin
ruth
as
we
used
to
call
her
though
the
cousinship
was
distant
what
was
become
of
uncle
ben
and
how
it
was
that
we
never
heard
anything
of
or
from
him
now
she
replied
that
she
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
her
grandfathers
manner
of
carrying
on
for
the
last
halfyear
or
more
he
was
apt
to
leave
his
home
she
said
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
going
none
knew
whither
and
returning
no
one
might
say
when
and
his
dress
in
her
opinion
was
enough
to
frighten
a
hodman
of
a
scavenger
of
the
roads
instead
of
the
decent
suit
of
kersey
or
of
sabbath
doeskins
such
as
had
won
the
respect
and
reverence
of
his
fellowtownsmen
but
the
worst
of
all
things
was
as
she
confessed
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
the
poor
old
gentleman
had
something
weighing
heavily
on
his
mind
it
will
shorten
his
days
cousin
ridd
she
said
for
she
never
would
call
me
cousin
john
he
has
no
enjoyment
of
anything
that
he
eats
or
drinks
nor
even
in
counting
his
money
as
he
used
to
do
all
sunday
indeed
no
pleasure
in
anything
unless
it
be
smoking
his
pipe
and
thinking
and
staring
at
bits
of
brown
stone
which
he
pulls
every
now
and
then
out
of
his
pockets
and
the
business
he
used
to
take
such
pride
in
is
now
left
almost
entirely
to
the
foreman
and
to
me
and
what
will
become
of
you
dear
ruth
if
anything
happens
to
the
old
man
i
am
sure
i
know
not
she
answered
simply
and
i
cannot
bear
to
think
of
it
it
must
depend
i
suppose
upon
dear
grandfathers
pleasure
about
me
it
must
rather
depend
said
i
though
having
no
business
to
say
it
upon
your
own
good
pleasure
ruth
for
all
the
world
will
pay
court
to
you
that
is
the
very
thing
which
i
never
could
endure
i
have
begged
dear
grandfather
to
leave
no
chance
of
that
when
he
has
threatened
me
with
poverty
as
he
does
sometimes
i
have
always
met
him
truly
with
the
answer
that
i
feared
one
thing
a
great
deal
worse
than
poverty
namely
to
be
an
heiress
but
i
cannot
make
him
believe
it
only
think
how
strange
cousin
ridd
i
cannot
make
him
believe
it
it
is
not
strange
at
all
i
answered
considering
how
he
values
money
neither
would
any
one
else
believe
you
except
by
looking
into
your
true
and
very
pretty
eyes
dear
now
i
beg
that
no
one
will
suspect
for
a
single
moment
either
that
i
did
not
mean
exactly
what
i
said
or
meant
a
single
atom
more
or
would
not
have
said
the
same
if
lorna
had
been
standing
by
what
i
had
always
liked
in
ruth
was
the
calm
straightforward
gaze
and
beauty
of
her
large
brown
eyes
indeed
i
had
spoken
of
them
to
lorna
as
the
only
ones
to
be
compared
though
not
for
more
than
a
moment
to
her
own
for
truth
and
light
but
never
for
depth
and
softness
but
now
the
little
maiden
dropped
them
and
turned
away
without
reply
i
will
go
and
see
to
my
horse
i
said
the
boy
that
has
taken
him
seemed
surprised
at
his
having
no
horns
on
his
forehead
perhaps
he
will
lead
him
into
the
shop
and
feed
him
upon
broadcloth
oh
he
is
such
a
stupid
boy
ruth
answered
with
great
sympathy
how
quick
of
you
to
observe
that
now
and
you
call
yourself
slow
john
ridd
i
never
did
see
such
a
stupid
boy
sometimes
he
spoils
my
temper
but
you
must
be
back
in
half
an
hour
at
the
latest
cousin
ridd
you
see
i
remember
what
you
are
when
once
you
get
among
horses
or
cows
or
things
of
that
sort
things
of
that
sort
well
done
ruth
one
would
think
you
were
quite
a
cockney
uncle
reuben
did
not
come
home
to
his
dinner
and
his
granddaughter
said
she
had
strictest
orders
never
to
expect
him
therefore
we
had
none
to
dine
with
us
except
the
foreman
of
the
shop
a
worthy
man
named
thomas
cockram
fifty
years
of
age
or
so
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
strong
intentions
of
his
own
about
little
ruth
and
on
that
account
to
regard
me
with
a
wholly
undue
malevolence
and
perhaps
in
order
to
justify
him
i
may
have
been
more
attentive
to
her
than
otherwise
need
have
been
at
any
rate
ruth
and
i
were
pleasant
and
he
the
very
opposite
my
dear
cousin
ruth
i
said
on
purpose
to
vex
master
cockram
because
he
eyed
us
so
heavily
and
squinted
to
unluckily
we
have
long
been
looking
for
you
at
our
plovers
barrows
farm
you
remember
how
you
used
to
love
hunting
for
eggs
in
the
morning
and
hiding
up
in
the
tallat
with
lizzie
for
me
to
seek
you
among
the
hay
when
the
sun
was
down
ah
master
cockram
those
are
the
things
young
people
find
their
pleasure
in
not
in
selling
a
yard
of
serge
and
giving
twopencehalfpenny
change
and
writing
settled
at
the
bottom
with
a
pencil
that
has
blacked
their
teeth
now
master
cockram
you
ought
to
come
as
far
as
our
good
farm
at
once
and
eat
two
newlaid
eggs
for
breakfast
and
be
made
to
look
quite
young
again
our
good
annie
would
cook
for
you
and
you
should
have
the
hot
new
milk
and
the
popes
eye
from
the
mutton
and
every
foot
of
you
would
become
a
yard
in
about
a
fortnight
and
hereupon
i
spread
my
chest
to
show
him
an
example
ruth
could
not
keep
her
countenance
but
i
saw
that
she
thought
it
wrong
of
me
and
would
scold
me
if
ever
i
gave
her
the
chance
of
taking
those
little
liberties
however
he
deserved
it
all
according
to
my
young
ideas
for
his
great
impertinence
in
aiming
at
my
cousin
but
what
i
said
was
far
less
grievous
to
a
man
of
honest
mind
than
little
ruths
own
behaviour
i
could
hardly
have
believed
that
so
thoroughly
true
a
girl
and
one
so
proud
and
upright
could
have
got
rid
of
any
man
so
cleverly
as
she
got
rid
of
master
thomas
cockram
she
gave
him
not
even
a
glass
of
wine
but
commended
to
his
notice
with
a
sweet
and
thoughtful
gravity
some
invoice
which
must
be
corrected
before
her
dear
grandfather
should
return
and
to
amend
which
three
great
ledgers
must
be
searched
from
first
to
last
thomas
cockram
winked
at
me
with
the
worst
of
his
two
wrong
eyes
as
much
as
to
say
i
understand
it
but
i
cannot
help
myself
only
you
look
out
if
everand
before
he
had
finished
winking
the
door
was
shut
behind
him
then
ruth
said
to
me
in
the
simplest
manner
you
have
ridden
far
today
cousin
ridd
and
have
far
to
ride
to
get
home
again
what
will
dear
aunt
ridd
say
if
we
send
you
away
without
nourishment
all
the
keys
are
in
my
keeping
and
dear
grandfather
has
the
finest
wine
not
to
be
matched
in
the
west
of
england
as
i
have
heard
good
judges
say
though
i
know
not
wine
from
cider
do
you
like
the
wine
of
oporto
or
the
wine
of
xeres
i
know
not
one
from
the
other
fair
cousin
except
by
the
colour
i
answered
but
the
sound
of
oporto
is
nobler
and
richer
suppose
we
try
wine
of
oporto
the
good
little
creature
went
and
fetched
a
black
bottle
of
an
ancient
cast
covered
with
dust
and
cobwebs
these
i
was
anxious
to
shake
aside
and
indeed
i
thought
that
the
wine
would
be
better
for
being
roused
up
a
little
ruth
however
would
not
hear
a
single
word
to
that
purport
and
seeing
that
she
knew
more
about
it
i
left
her
to
manage
it
and
the
result
was
very
fine
indeed
to
wit
a
sparkling
rosy
liquor
dancing
with
little
flakes
of
light
and
scented
like
new
violets
with
this
i
was
so
pleased
and
gay
and
ruth
so
glad
to
see
me
gay
that
we
quite
forgot
how
the
time
went
on
and
though
my
fair
cousin
would
not
be
persuaded
to
take
a
second
glass
herself
she
kept
on
filling
mine
so
fast
that
it
was
never
empty
though
i
did
my
best
to
keep
it
so
what
is
a
little
drop
like
this
to
a
man
of
your
size
and
strength
cousin
ridd
she
said
with
her
cheeks
just
brushed
with
rose
which
made
her
look
very
beautiful
i
have
heard
you
say
that
your
head
is
so
thickor
rather
so
clear
you
ought
to
saythat
no
liquor
ever
moves
it
that
is
right
enough
i
answered
what
a
witch
you
must
be
dear
ruth
to
have
remembered
that
now
oh
i
remember
every
word
i
have
ever
heard
you
say
cousin
ridd
because
your
voice
is
so
deep
you
know
and
you
talk
so
little
now
it
is
useless
to
say
no
these
bottles
hold
almost
nothing
dear
grandfather
will
not
come
home
i
fear
until
long
after
you
are
gone
what
will
aunt
ridd
think
of
me
i
am
sure
you
are
all
so
dreadfully
hospitable
now
not
another
no
cousin
ridd
we
must
have
another
bottle
well
must
is
must
i
answered
with
a
certain
resignation
i
cannot
bear
bad
manners
dear
and
how
old
are
you
next
birthday
eighteen
dear
john
said
ruth
coming
over
with
the
empty
bottle
and
i
was
pleased
at
her
calling
me
john
and
had
a
great
mind
to
kiss
her
however
i
thought
of
my
lorna
suddenly
and
of
the
anger
i
should
feel
if
a
man
went
on
with
her
so
therefore
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
to
wait
for
the
other
bottle
do
you
remember
how
we
danced
that
night
i
asked
while
she
was
opening
it
and
how
you
were
afraid
of
me
first
because
i
looked
so
tall
dear
yes
and
so
very
broad
cousin
ridd
i
thought
that
you
would
eat
me
but
i
have
come
to
know
since
then
how
very
kind
and
good
you
are
and
will
you
come
and
dance
again
at
my
wedding
cousin
ruth
she
nearly
let
the
bottle
fall
the
last
of
which
she
was
sloping
carefully
into
a
vessel
of
bright
glass
and
then
she
raised
her
hand
again
and
finished
it
judiciously
and
after
that
she
took
the
window
to
see
that
all
her
work
was
clear
and
then
she
poured
me
out
a
glass
and
said
with
very
pale
cheeks
but
else
no
sign
of
meaning
about
her
what
did
you
ask
me
cousin
ridd
nothing
of
any
importance
ruth
only
we
are
so
fond
of
you
i
mean
to
be
married
as
soon
as
i
can
will
you
come
and
help
us
to
be
sure
i
will
cousin
riddunless
unless
dear
grandfather
cannot
spare
me
from
the
business
she
went
away
and
her
breast
was
heaving
like
a
rick
of
undercarried
hay
and
she
stood
at
the
window
long
trying
to
make
yawns
of
sighs
for
my
part
i
knew
not
what
to
do
and
yet
i
could
think
about
it
as
i
never
could
with
lorna
with
whom
i
was
always
in
a
whirl
from
the
power
of
my
love
so
i
thought
some
time
about
it
and
perceived
that
it
was
the
manliest
way
just
to
tell
her
everything
except
that
i
feared
she
liked
me
but
it
seemed
to
me
unaccountable
that
she
did
not
even
ask
the
name
of
my
intended
wife
perhaps
she
thought
that
it
must
be
sally
or
perhaps
she
feared
to
trust
her
voice
come
and
sit
by
me
dear
ruth
and
listen
to
a
long
long
story
how
things
have
come
about
with
me
no
thank
you
cousin
ridd
she
answered
at
least
i
mean
that
i
shall
be
happythat
i
shall
be
ready
to
hear
youto
listen
to
you
i
mean
of
course
but
i
would
rather
stay
where
i
am
and
have
the
airor
rather
be
able
to
watch
for
dear
grandfather
coming
home
he
is
so
kind
and
good
to
me
what
should
i
do
without
him
then
i
told
her
how
for
years
and
years
i
had
been
attached
to
lorna
and
all
the
dangers
and
difficulties
which
had
so
long
beset
us
and
how
i
hoped
that
these
were
passing
and
no
other
might
come
between
us
except
on
the
score
of
religion
upon
which
point
i
trusted
soon
to
overcome
my
mothers
objections
and
then
i
told
her
how
poor
and
helpless
and
alone
in
the
world
my
lorna
was
and
how
sad
all
her
youth
had
been
until
i
brought
her
away
at
last
and
many
other
little
things
i
mentioned
which
there
is
no
need
for
me
again
to
dwell
upon
ruth
heard
it
all
without
a
word
and
without
once
looking
at
me
and
only
by
her
attitude
could
i
guess
that
she
was
weeping
then
when
all
my
tale
was
told
she
asked
in
a
low
and
gentle
voice
but
still
without
showing
her
face
to
me
and
does
she
love
you
cousin
ridd
does
she
say
that
she
loves
you
withwith
all
her
heart
certainly
she
does
i
answered
do
you
think
it
impossible
for
one
like
her
to
do
so
she
said
no
more
but
crossed
the
room
before
i
had
time
to
look
at
her
and
came
behind
my
chair
and
kissed
me
gently
on
the
forehead
i
hope
you
may
be
very
happy
withi
mean
in
your
new
life
she
whispered
very
softly
as
happy
as
you
deserve
to
be
and
as
happy
as
you
can
make
others
be
now
how
i
have
been
neglecting
you
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
for
thinking
only
of
grandfather
and
it
makes
me
so
lowspirited
you
have
told
me
a
very
nice
romance
and
i
have
never
even
helped
you
to
a
glass
of
wine
here
pour
it
for
yourself
dear
cousin
i
shall
be
back
again
directly
with
that
she
was
out
of
the
door
in
a
moment
and
when
she
came
back
you
would
not
have
thought
that
a
tear
had
dimmed
those
large
bright
eyes
or
wandered
down
those
pale
clear
cheeks
only
her
hands
were
cold
and
trembling
and
she
made
me
help
myself
uncle
reuben
did
not
appear
at
all
and
ruth
who
had
promised
to
come
and
see
us
and
stay
for
a
fortnight
at
our
house
if
her
grandfather
could
spare
her
now
discovered
before
i
left
that
she
must
not
think
of
doing
so
perhaps
she
was
right
in
deciding
thus
at
any
rate
it
had
now
become
improper
for
me
to
press
her
and
yet
i
now
desired
tenfold
that
she
should
consent
to
come
thinking
that
lorna
herself
would
work
the
speediest
cure
of
her
passing
whim
for
such
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
was
the
nature
of
ruths
regard
for
me
and
upon
looking
back
i
could
not
charge
myself
with
any
misconduct
towards
the
little
maiden
i
had
never
sought
her
company
i
had
never
trifled
with
her
at
least
until
that
very
day
and
being
so
engrossed
with
my
own
love
i
had
scarcely
ever
thought
of
her
and
the
maiden
would
never
have
thought
of
me
except
as
a
clumsy
yokel
but
for
my
mothers
and
sisters
meddling
and
their
wily
suggestions
i
believe
they
had
told
the
little
soul
that
i
was
deeply
in
love
with
her
although
they
both
stoutly
denied
it
but
who
can
place
trust
in
a
womans
word
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
matchmaking
chapter
li
a
visit
from
the
counsellor
now
while
i
was
riding
home
that
evening
with
a
tender
conscience
about
ruth
although
not
a
wounded
one
i
guessed
but
little
that
all
my
thoughts
were
needed
much
for
my
own
affairs
so
however
it
proved
to
be
for
as
i
came
in
soon
after
dark
my
sister
eliza
met
me
at
the
corner
of
the
cheeseroom
and
she
said
dont
go
in
there
john
pointing
to
mothers
room
until
i
have
had
a
talk
with
you
in
the
name
of
moses
i
inquired
having
picked
up
that
phrase
at
dulverton
what
are
you
at
about
me
now
there
is
no
peace
for
a
quiet
fellow
it
is
nothing
we
are
at
she
answered
neither
may
you
make
light
of
it
it
is
something
very
important
about
mistress
lorna
doone
let
us
have
it
at
once
i
cried
i
can
bear
anything
about
lorna
except
that
she
does
not
care
for
me
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
john
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
never
need
fear
anything
of
that
sort
she
perfectly
wearies
me
sometimes
although
her
voice
is
so
soft
and
sweet
about
your
endless
perfections
bless
her
little
heart
i
said
the
subject
is
inexhaustible
no
doubt
replied
lizzie
in
the
driest
manner
especially
to
your
sisters
however
this
is
no
time
to
joke
i
fear
you
will
get
the
worst
of
it
john
do
you
know
a
man
of
about
gwennys
shape
nearly
as
broad
as
he
is
long
but
about
six
times
the
size
of
gwenny
and
with
a
length
of
snowwhite
hair
and
a
thickness
also
as
the
copses
were
last
winter
he
never
can
comb
it
that
is
quite
certain
with
any
comb
yet
invented
then
you
go
and
offer
your
services
there
are
few
things
you
cannot
scarify
i
know
the
man
from
your
description
although
i
have
never
seen
him
now
where
is
my
lorna
your
lorna
is
with
annie
having
a
good
cry
i
believe
and
annie
too
glad
to
second
her
she
knows
that
this
great
man
is
here
and
knows
that
he
wants
to
see
her
but
she
begged
to
defer
the
interview
until
dear
johns
return
what
a
nasty
way
you
have
of
telling
the
very
commonest
piece
of
news
i
said
on
purpose
to
pay
her
out
what
man
will
ever
fancy
you
you
unlucky
little
snapper
now
no
more
nursery
talk
for
me
i
will
go
and
settle
this
business
you
had
better
go
and
dress
your
dolls
if
you
can
give
them
clothes
unpoisoned
hereupon
lizzie
burst
into
a
perfect
roar
of
tears
feeling
that
she
had
the
worst
of
it
and
i
took
her
up
and
begged
her
pardon
although
she
scarcely
deserved
it
for
she
knew
that
i
was
out
of
luck
and
she
might
have
spared
her
satire
i
was
almost
sure
that
the
man
who
was
come
must
be
the
counsellor
himself
of
whom
i
felt
much
keener
fear
than
of
his
son
carver
and
knowing
that
his
visit
boded
ill
to
me
and
lorna
i
went
and
sought
my
dear
and
led
her
with
a
heavy
heart
from
the
maidens
room
to
mothers
to
meet
our
dreadful
visitor
mother
was
standing
by
the
door
making
curtseys
now
and
then
and
listening
to
a
long
harangue
upon
the
rights
of
state
and
land
which
the
counsellor
having
found
that
she
was
the
owner
of
her
property
and
knew
nothing
of
her
title
to
it
was
encouraged
to
deliver
it
my
dear
mother
stood
gazing
at
him
spellbound
by
his
eloquence
and
only
hoping
that
he
would
stop
he
was
shaking
his
hair
upon
his
shoulders
in
the
power
of
his
words
and
his
wrath
at
some
little
thing
which
he
declared
to
be
quite
illegal
then
i
ventured
to
show
myself
in
the
flesh
before
him
although
he
feigned
not
to
see
me
but
he
advanced
with
zeal
to
lorna
holding
out
both
hands
at
once
my
darling
child
my
dearest
niece
how
wonderfully
well
you
look
mistress
ridd
i
give
you
credit
this
is
the
country
of
good
things
i
never
would
have
believed
our
queen
could
have
looked
so
royal
surely
of
all
virtues
hospitality
is
the
finest
and
the
most
romantic
dearest
lorna
kiss
your
uncle
it
is
quite
a
privilege
perhaps
it
is
to
you
sir
said
lorna
who
could
never
quite
check
her
sense
of
oddity
but
i
fear
that
you
have
smoked
tobacco
which
spoils
reciprocity
you
are
right
my
child
how
keen
your
scent
is
it
is
always
so
with
us
your
grandfather
was
noted
for
his
olfactory
powers
ah
a
great
loss
dear
mrs
ridd
a
terrible
loss
to
this
neighbourhood
as
one
of
our
great
writers
saysi
think
it
must
be
miltonwe
neer
shall
look
upon
his
like
again
with
your
good
leave
sir
i
broke
in
master
milton
could
never
have
written
so
sweet
and
simple
a
line
as
that
it
is
one
of
the
great
shakespeare
woe
is
me
for
my
neglect
said
the
counsellor
bowing
airily
this
must
be
your
son
mistress
ridd
the
great
john
the
wrestler
and
one
who
meddles
with
the
muses
ah
since
i
was
young
how
everything
is
changed
madam
except
indeed
the
beauty
of
women
which
seems
to
me
to
increase
every
year
here
the
old
villain
bowed
to
my
mother
and
she
blushed
and
made
another
curtsey
and
really
did
look
very
nice
now
though
i
have
quoted
the
poets
amiss
as
your
son
informs
me
for
which
i
tender
my
best
thanks
and
must
amend
my
reading
i
can
hardly
be
wrong
in
assuming
that
this
young
armiger
must
be
the
too
attractive
cynosure
to
our
poor
little
maiden
and
for
my
part
she
is
welcome
to
him
i
have
never
been
one
of
those
who
dwell
upon
distinctions
of
rank
and
birth
and
such
like
as
if
they
were
in
the
heart
of
nature
and
must
be
eternal
in
early
youth
i
may
have
thought
so
and
been
full
of
that
little
pride
but
now
i
have
long
accounted
it
one
of
the
first
axioms
of
political
economyyou
are
following
me
mistress
ridd
well
sir
i
am
doing
my
best
but
i
cannot
quite
keep
up
with
you
never
mind
madam
i
will
be
slower
but
your
sons
intelligence
is
so
quick
i
see
sir
you
thought
that
mine
must
be
but
no
it
all
comes
from
his
father
sir
his
father
was
that
quick
and
clever
ah
i
can
well
suppose
it
madam
and
a
credit
he
is
to
both
of
you
now
to
return
to
our
muttonsa
figure
which
you
will
appreciatei
may
now
be
regarded
i
think
as
this
young
ladys
legal
guardian
although
i
have
not
had
the
honour
of
being
formally
appointed
such
her
father
was
the
eldest
son
of
sir
ensor
doone
and
i
happened
to
be
the
second
son
and
as
young
maidens
cannot
be
baronets
i
suppose
i
am
sir
counsellor
is
it
so
mistress
ridd
according
to
your
theory
of
genealogy
i
am
sure
i
dont
know
sir
my
mother
answered
carefully
i
know
not
anything
of
that
name
sir
except
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
but
i
see
not
why
it
should
be
otherwise
good
madam
i
may
look
upon
that
as
your
sanction
and
approval
and
the
college
of
heralds
shall
hear
of
it
and
in
return
as
lornas
guardian
i
give
my
full
and
ready
consent
to
her
marriage
with
your
son
madam
oh
how
good
of
you
sir
how
kind
well
i
always
did
say
that
the
learnedest
people
were
almost
always
the
best
and
kindest
and
the
most
simplehearted
madam
that
is
a
great
sentiment
what
a
goodly
couple
they
will
be
and
if
we
can
add
him
to
our
strength
oh
no
sir
oh
no
cried
mother
you
really
must
not
think
of
it
he
has
always
been
brought
up
so
honest
hem
that
makes
a
difference
a
decided
disqualification
for
domestic
life
among
the
doones
but
surely
he
might
get
over
those
prejudices
madam
oh
no
sir
he
never
can
he
never
can
indeed
when
he
was
only
that
high
sir
he
could
not
steal
even
an
apple
when
some
wicked
boys
tried
to
mislead
him
ah
replied
the
counsellor
shaking
his
white
head
gravely
then
i
greatly
fear
that
his
case
is
quite
incurable
i
have
known
such
cases
violent
prejudice
bred
entirely
of
education
and
antieconomical
to
the
last
degree
and
when
it
is
so
it
is
desperate
no
man
after
imbibing
ideas
of
that
sort
can
in
any
way
be
useful
oh
yes
sir
john
is
very
useful
he
can
do
as
much
work
as
three
other
men
and
you
should
see
him
load
a
sledd
sir
i
was
speaking
madam
of
higher
usefulnesspower
of
the
brain
and
heart
the
main
thing
for
us
upon
earth
is
to
take
a
large
view
of
things
but
while
we
talk
of
the
heart
what
is
my
niece
lorna
doing
that
she
does
not
come
and
thank
me
for
my
perhaps
too
prompt
concession
to
her
youthful
fancies
ah
if
i
had
wanted
thanks
i
should
have
been
more
stubborn
lorna
being
challenged
thus
came
up
and
looked
at
her
uncle
with
her
noble
eyes
fixed
full
upon
his
which
beneath
his
white
eyebrows
glistened
like
dormer
windows
piled
with
snow
for
what
am
i
to
thank
you
uncle
my
dear
niece
i
have
told
you
for
removing
the
heaviest
obstacle
which
to
a
mind
so
well
regulated
could
possibly
have
existed
between
your
dutiful
self
and
the
object
of
your
affections
well
uncle
i
should
be
very
grateful
if
i
thought
that
you
did
so
from
love
of
me
or
if
i
did
not
know
that
you
have
something
yet
concealed
from
me
and
my
consent
said
the
counsellor
is
the
more
meritorious
the
more
liberal
frank
and
candid
in
the
face
of
an
existing
fact
and
a
very
clearly
established
one
which
might
have
appeared
to
weaker
minds
in
the
light
of
an
impediment
but
to
my
loftier
view
of
matrimony
seems
quite
a
recommendation
what
fact
do
you
mean
sir
is
it
one
that
i
ought
to
know
in
my
opinion
it
is
good
niece
it
forms
to
my
mind
so
fine
a
basis
for
the
invariable
harmony
of
the
matrimonial
state
to
be
briefas
i
always
endeavour
to
be
without
becoming
obscureyou
two
young
people
ah
what
a
gift
is
youth
one
can
never
be
too
thankful
for
it
you
will
have
the
rare
advantage
of
commencing
married
life
with
a
subject
of
common
interest
to
discuss
whenever
you
weary
ofwell
say
of
one
another
if
you
can
now
by
any
means
conceive
such
a
possibility
and
perfect
justice
meted
out
mutual
goodwill
resulting
from
the
sense
of
reciprocity
i
do
not
understand
you
sir
why
can
you
not
say
what
you
mean
at
once
my
dear
child
i
prolong
your
suspense
curiosity
is
the
most
powerful
of
all
feminine
instincts
and
therefore
the
most
delightful
when
not
prematurely
satisfied
however
if
you
must
have
my
strong
realities
here
they
are
your
father
slew
dear
johns
father
and
dear
johns
father
slew
yours
having
said
thus
much
the
counsellor
leaned
back
upon
his
chair
and
shaded
his
calm
whitebearded
eyes
from
the
rays
of
our
tallow
candles
he
was
a
man
who
liked
to
look
rather
than
to
be
looked
at
but
lorna
came
to
me
for
aid
and
i
went
up
to
lorna
and
mother
looked
at
both
of
us
then
feeling
that
i
must
speak
first
as
no
one
would
begin
it
i
took
my
darling
round
the
waist
and
led
her
up
to
the
counsellor
while
she
tried
to
bear
it
bravely
yet
must
lean
on
me
or
did
now
sir
counsellor
doone
i
said
with
lorna
squeezing
both
my
hands
i
never
yet
knew
how
considering
that
she
was
walking
all
the
time
or
something
like
it
you
know
right
well
sir
counsellor
that
sir
ensor
doone
gave
approval
i
cannot
tell
what
made
me
think
of
this
but
so
it
came
upon
me
approval
to
what
good
rustic
john
to
the
slaughter
so
reciprocal
no
sir
not
to
that
even
if
it
ever
happened
which
i
do
not
believe
but
to
the
love
betwixt
me
and
lorna
which
your
story
shall
not
break
without
more
evidence
than
your
word
and
even
so
shall
never
break
if
lorna
thinks
as
i
do
the
maiden
gave
me
a
little
touch
as
much
as
to
say
you
are
right
darling
give
it
to
him
again
like
that
however
i
held
my
peace
well
knowing
that
too
many
words
do
mischief
then
mother
looked
at
me
with
wonder
being
herself
too
amazed
to
speak
and
the
counsellor
looked
with
great
wrath
in
his
eyes
which
he
tried
to
keep
from
burning
how
say
you
then
john
ridd
he
cried
stretching
out
one
hand
like
elijah
is
this
a
thing
of
the
sort
you
love
is
this
what
you
are
used
to
so
please
your
worship
i
answered
no
kind
of
violence
can
surprise
us
since
first
came
doones
upon
exmoor
up
to
that
time
none
heard
of
harm
except
of
taking
a
purse
maybe
or
cutting
a
strange
sheeps
throat
and
the
poor
folk
who
did
this
were
hanged
with
some
benefit
of
clergy
but
ever
since
the
doones
came
first
we
are
used
to
anything
thou
varlet
cried
the
counsellor
with
the
colour
of
his
eyes
quite
changed
with
the
sparkles
of
his
fury
is
this
the
way
we
are
to
deal
with
such
a
lowbred
clod
as
thou
to
question
the
doings
of
our
people
and
to
talk
of
clergy
what
dream
you
not
that
we
could
have
clergy
and
of
the
right
sort
too
if
only
we
cared
to
have
them
tush
am
i
to
spend
my
time
arguing
with
a
ploughtail
bob
if
your
worship
will
hearken
to
me
i
answered
very
modestly
not
wishing
to
speak
harshly
with
lorna
looking
up
at
me
there
are
many
things
that
might
be
said
without
any
kind
of
argument
which
i
would
never
wish
to
try
with
one
of
your
worships
learning
and
in
the
first
place
it
seems
to
me
that
if
our
fathers
hated
one
another
bitterly
yet
neither
won
the
victory
only
mutual
discomfiture
surely
that
is
but
a
reason
why
we
should
be
wiser
than
they
and
make
it
up
in
this
generation
by
goodwill
and
loving
oh
john
you
wiser
than
your
father
mother
broke
upon
me
here
not
but
what
you
might
be
as
wise
when
you
come
to
be
old
enough
young
people
of
the
present
age
said
the
counsellor
severely
have
no
right
feeling
of
any
sort
upon
the
simplest
matter
lorna
doone
stand
forth
from
contact
with
that
heir
of
parricide
and
state
in
your
own
mellifluous
voice
whether
you
regard
this
slaughter
as
a
pleasant
trifle
you
know
without
any
words
of
mine
she
answered
very
softly
yet
not
withdrawing
from
my
hand
that
although
i
have
been
seasoned
well
to
every
kind
of
outrage
among
my
gentle
relatives
i
have
not
yet
so
purely
lost
all
sense
of
right
and
wrong
as
to
receive
what
you
have
said
as
lightly
as
you
declared
it
you
think
it
a
happy
basis
for
our
future
concord
i
do
not
quite
think
that
my
uncle
neither
do
i
quite
believe
that
a
word
of
it
is
true
in
our
happy
valley
ninetenths
of
what
is
said
is
false
and
you
were
always
wont
to
argue
that
true
and
false
are
but
a
blind
turned
upon
a
pivot
without
any
failure
of
respect
for
your
character
good
uncle
i
decline
politely
to
believe
a
word
of
what
you
have
told
me
and
even
if
it
were
proved
to
me
all
i
can
say
is
this
if
my
john
will
have
me
i
am
his
for
ever
this
long
speech
was
too
much
for
her
she
had
overrated
her
strength
about
it
and
the
sustenance
of
irony
so
at
last
she
fell
into
my
arms
which
had
long
been
waiting
for
her
and
there
she
lay
with
no
other
sound
except
a
gurgling
in
her
throat
you
old
villain
cried
my
mother
shaking
her
fist
at
the
counsellor
while
i
could
do
nothing
else
but
hold
and
bend
across
my
darling
and
whisper
to
deaf
ears
what
is
the
good
of
the
quality
if
this
is
all
that
comes
of
it
out
of
the
way
you
know
the
words
that
make
the
deadly
mischief
but
not
the
ways
that
heal
them
give
me
that
bottle
if
hands
you
have
what
is
the
use
of
counsellors
i
saw
that
dear
mother
was
carried
away
and
indeed
i
myself
was
something
like
it
with
the
pale
face
upon
my
bosom
and
the
heaving
of
the
heart
and
the
heat
and
cold
all
through
me
as
my
darling
breathed
or
lay
meanwhile
the
counsellor
stood
back
and
seemed
a
little
sorry
although
of
course
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
be
at
all
ashamed
of
himself
my
sweet
love
my
darling
child
our
mother
went
on
to
lorna
in
a
way
that
i
shall
never
forget
though
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
pretty
pet
not
a
word
of
it
is
true
upon
that
old
liars
oath
and
if
every
word
were
true
poor
chick
you
should
have
our
john
all
the
more
for
it
you
and
john
were
made
by
god
and
meant
for
one
another
whatever
falls
between
you
little
lamb
look
up
and
speak
here
is
your
own
john
and
i
and
the
devil
take
the
counsellor
i
was
amazed
at
mothers
words
being
so
unlike
her
while
i
loved
her
all
the
more
because
she
forgot
herself
so
in
another
moment
in
ran
annie
ay
and
lizzie
also
knowing
by
some
mystic
sense
which
i
have
often
noticed
but
never
could
explain
that
something
was
astir
belonging
to
the
world
of
women
yet
foreign
to
the
eyes
of
men
and
now
the
counsellor
being
wellborn
although
such
a
heartless
miscreant
beckoned
to
me
to
come
away
which
i
being
smothered
with
women
was
only
too
glad
to
do
as
soon
as
my
own
love
would
let
go
of
me
that
is
the
worst
of
them
said
the
old
man
when
i
had
led
him
into
our
kitchen
with
an
apology
at
every
step
and
given
him
hot
schnapps
and
water
and
a
cigarro
of
brave
tom
faggus
you
never
can
say
much
sir
in
the
way
of
reasoning
however
gently
meant
and
put
but
what
these
women
will
fly
out
it
is
wiser
to
put
a
wild
bird
in
a
cage
and
expect
him
to
sit
and
look
at
you
and
chirp
without
a
feather
rumpled
than
it
is
to
expect
a
woman
to
answer
reason
reasonably
saying
this
he
looked
at
his
puff
of
smoke
as
if
it
contained
more
reason
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
sir
i
answered
according
to
a
phrase
which
has
always
been
my
favourite
on
account
of
its
general
truth
moreover
he
was
now
our
guest
and
had
right
to
be
treated
accordingly
i
am
as
you
see
not
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
women
except
my
mother
and
sisters
except
not
even
them
my
son
said
the
counsellor
now
having
finished
his
glass
without
much
consultation
about
it
if
you
once
understand
your
mother
and
sisterswhy
you
understand
the
lot
of
them
he
made
a
twist
in
his
cloud
of
smoke
and
dashed
his
finger
through
it
so
that
i
could
not
follow
his
meaning
and
in
manners
liked
not
to
press
him
now
of
this
business
john
he
said
after
getting
to
the
bottom
of
the
second
glass
and
having
a
trifle
or
so
to
eat
and
praising
our
chimneycorner
taking
you
on
the
whole
you
know
you
are
wonderfully
good
people
and
instead
of
giving
me
up
to
the
soldiers
as
you
might
have
done
you
are
doing
your
best
to
make
me
drunk
not
at
all
sir
i
answered
not
at
all
your
worship
let
me
mix
you
another
glass
we
rarely
have
a
great
gentleman
by
the
side
of
our
embers
and
oven
i
only
beg
your
pardon
sir
that
my
sister
annie
who
knows
where
to
find
all
the
good
pans
and
the
lard
could
not
wait
upon
you
this
evening
and
i
fear
they
have
done
it
with
dripping
instead
and
in
a
pan
with
the
bottom
burned
but
old
betty
quite
loses
her
head
sometimes
by
dint
of
overscolding
my
son
replied
the
counsellor
standing
across
the
front
of
the
fire
to
prove
his
strict
sobriety
i
meant
to
come
down
upon
you
tonight
but
you
have
turned
the
tables
upon
me
not
through
any
skill
on
your
part
nor
through
any
paltry
weakness
as
to
love
and
all
that
stuff
which
boys
and
girls
spin
tops
at
or
knock
dolls
noses
together
but
through
your
simple
way
of
taking
me
as
a
man
to
be
believed
combined
with
the
comfort
of
this
place
and
the
choice
tobacco
and
cordials
i
have
not
enjoyed
an
evening
so
much
god
bless
me
if
i
know
when
your
worship
said
i
makes
me
more
proud
than
i
well
know
what
to
do
with
of
all
the
things
that
please
and
lead
us
into
happy
sleep
at
night
the
first
and
chiefest
is
to
think
that
we
have
pleased
a
visitor
then
john
thou
hast
deserved
good
sleep
for
i
am
not
pleased
easily
but
although
our
family
is
not
so
high
now
as
it
hath
been
i
have
enough
of
the
gentleman
left
to
be
pleased
when
good
people
try
me
my
father
sir
ensor
was
better
than
i
in
this
great
element
of
birth
and
my
son
carver
is
far
worse
aetas
parentum
what
is
it
my
boy
i
hear
that
you
have
been
at
a
grammarschool
so
i
have
your
worship
and
at
a
very
good
one
but
i
only
got
far
enough
to
make
more
tail
than
head
of
latin
let
that
pass
said
the
counsellor
john
thou
art
all
the
wiser
and
the
old
man
shook
his
hoary
locks
as
if
latin
had
been
his
ruin
i
looked
at
him
sadly
and
wondered
whether
it
might
have
so
ruined
me
but
for
gods
mercy
in
stopping
it
chapter
lii
the
way
to
make
the
cream
rise
that
night
the
reverend
counsellor
not
being
in
such
state
of
mind
as
ought
to
go
alone
kindly
took
our
best
old
bedstead
carved
in
panels
well
enough
with
the
woman
of
samaria
i
set
him
up
both
straight
and
heavy
so
that
he
need
but
close
both
eyes
and
keep
his
mouth
just
open
and
in
the
morning
he
was
thankful
for
all
that
he
could
remember
i
for
my
part
scarcely
knew
whether
he
really
had
begun
to
feel
goodwill
towards
us
and
to
see
that
nothing
else
could
be
of
any
use
to
him
or
whether
he
was
merely
acting
so
as
to
deceive
us
and
it
had
struck
me
several
times
that
he
had
made
a
great
deal
more
of
the
spirit
he
had
taken
than
the
quantity
would
warrant
with
a
man
so
wise
and
solid
neither
did
i
quite
understand
a
little
story
which
lorna
told
me
how
that
in
the
night
awaking
she
had
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
a
sound
of
feeling
in
her
room
as
if
there
had
been
some
one
groping
carefully
among
the
things
within
her
drawers
or
wardrobecloset
but
the
noise
had
ceased
at
once
she
said
when
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
and
knowing
how
many
mice
we
had
she
took
courage
and
fell
asleep
again
after
breakfast
the
counsellor
who
looked
no
whit
the
worse
for
schnapps
but
even
more
grave
and
venerable
followed
our
annie
into
the
dairy
to
see
how
we
managed
the
clotted
cream
of
which
he
had
eaten
a
basinful
and
thereupon
they
talked
a
little
and
annie
thought
him
a
fine
old
gentleman
and
a
very
just
one
for
he
had
nobly
condemned
the
people
who
spoke
against
tom
faggus
your
honour
must
plainly
understand
said
annie
being
now
alone
with
him
and
spreading
out
her
light
quick
hands
over
the
pans
like
butterflies
that
they
are
brought
in
here
to
cool
after
being
set
in
the
basinholes
with
the
woodash
under
them
which
i
showed
you
in
the
backkitchen
and
they
must
have
very
little
heat
not
enough
to
simmer
even
only
just
to
make
the
bubbles
rise
and
the
scum
upon
the
top
set
thick
and
after
that
it
clots
as
firmoh
as
firm
as
my
two
hands
be
have
you
ever
heard
asked
the
counsellor
who
enjoyed
this
talk
with
annie
that
if
you
pass
across
the
top
without
breaking
the
surface
a
string
of
beads
or
polished
glass
or
anything
of
that
kind
the
cream
will
set
three
times
as
solid
and
in
thrice
the
quantity
no
sir
i
have
never
heard
that
said
annie
staring
with
all
her
simple
eyes
what
a
thing
it
is
to
read
books
and
grow
learned
but
it
is
very
easy
to
try
it
i
will
get
my
coral
necklace
it
will
not
be
witchcraft
will
it
sir
certainly
not
the
old
man
replied
i
will
make
the
experiment
myself
and
you
may
trust
me
not
to
be
hurt
my
dear
but
coral
will
not
do
my
child
neither
will
anything
coloured
the
beads
must
be
of
plain
common
glass
but
the
brighter
they
are
the
better
then
i
know
the
very
thing
cried
annie
as
bright
as
bright
can
be
and
without
any
colour
in
it
except
in
the
sun
or
candle
light
dearest
lorna
has
the
very
thing
a
necklace
of
some
old
glassbeads
or
i
think
they
called
them
jewels
she
will
be
too
glad
to
lend
it
to
us
i
will
go
for
it
in
a
moment
my
dear
it
cannot
be
half
so
bright
as
your
own
pretty
eyes
but
remember
one
thing
annie
you
must
not
say
what
it
is
for
or
even
that
i
am
going
to
use
it
or
anything
at
all
about
it
else
the
charm
will
be
broken
bring
it
here
without
a
word
if
you
know
where
she
keeps
it
to
be
sure
i
do
she
answered
john
used
to
keep
it
for
her
but
she
took
it
away
from
him
last
week
and
she
wore
it
wheni
mean
when
somebody
was
here
and
he
said
it
was
very
valuable
and
spoke
with
great
learning
about
it
and
called
it
by
some
particular
name
which
i
forget
at
this
moment
but
valuable
or
not
we
cannot
hurt
it
can
we
sir
by
passing
it
over
the
creampan
hurt
it
cried
the
counsellor
nay
we
shall
do
it
good
my
dear
it
will
help
to
raise
the
cream
and
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
young
maiden
none
can
do
good
in
this
world
without
in
turn
receiving
it
pronouncing
this
great
sentiment
he
looked
so
grand
and
benevolent
that
annie
as
she
said
afterwards
could
scarce
forbear
from
kissing
him
yet
feared
to
take
the
liberty
therefore
she
only
ran
away
to
fetch
my
lornas
necklace
now
as
luck
would
have
itwhether
good
luck
or
otherwise
you
must
not
judge
too
hastilymy
darling
had
taken
it
into
her
head
only
a
day
or
two
before
that
i
was
far
too
valuable
to
be
trusted
with
her
necklace
now
that
she
had
some
idea
of
its
price
and
quality
she
had
begun
to
fear
that
some
one
perhaps
even
squire
faggus
in
whom
her
faith
was
illiberal
might
form
designs
against
my
health
to
win
the
bauble
from
me
so
with
many
pretty
coaxings
she
had
led
me
to
give
it
up
which
except
for
her
own
sake
i
was
glad
enough
to
do
misliking
a
charge
of
such
importance
therefore
annie
found
it
sparkling
in
the
little
secret
hole
near
the
head
of
lornas
bed
which
she
herself
had
recommended
for
its
safer
custody
and
without
a
word
to
any
one
she
brought
it
down
and
danced
it
in
the
air
before
the
counsellor
for
him
to
admire
its
lustre
oh
that
old
thing
said
the
gentleman
in
a
tone
of
some
contempt
i
remember
that
old
thing
well
enough
however
for
want
of
a
better
no
doubt
it
will
answer
our
purpose
three
times
three
i
pass
it
over
crinkleum
crankum
grass
and
clover
what
are
you
feared
of
you
silly
child
good
sir
it
is
perfect
witchcraft
i
am
sure
of
that
because
it
rhymes
oh
what
would
mother
say
to
me
shall
i
ever
go
to
heaven
again
oh
i
see
the
cream
already
to
be
sure
you
do
but
you
must
not
look
or
the
whole
charm
will
be
broken
and
the
devil
will
fly
away
with
the
pan
and
drown
every
cow
you
have
got
in
it
oh
sir
it
is
too
horrible
how
could
you
lead
me
to
such
a
sin
away
with
thee
witch
of
endor
for
the
door
began
to
creak
and
a
broom
appeared
suddenly
in
the
opening
with
our
betty
no
doubt
behind
it
but
annie
in
the
greatest
terror
slammed
the
door
and
bolted
it
and
then
turned
again
to
the
counsellor
yet
looking
at
his
face
had
not
the
courage
to
reproach
him
for
his
eyes
rolled
like
two
blazing
barrels
and
his
white
shagged
brows
were
knit
across
them
and
his
forehead
scowled
in
black
furrows
so
that
annie
said
that
if
she
ever
saw
the
devil
she
saw
him
then
and
no
mistake
whether
the
old
man
wished
to
scare
her
or
whether
he
was
trying
not
to
laugh
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
now
he
said
in
a
deep
stern
whisper
not
a
word
of
this
to
a
living
soul
neither
must
you
nor
any
other
enter
this
place
for
three
hours
at
least
by
that
time
the
charm
will
have
done
its
work
the
pan
will
be
cream
to
the
bottom
and
you
will
bless
me
for
a
secret
which
will
make
your
fortune
put
the
bauble
under
this
pannikin
which
none
must
lift
for
a
day
and
a
night
have
no
fear
my
simple
wench
not
a
breath
of
harm
shall
come
to
you
if
you
obey
my
orders
oh
that
i
will
sir
that
i
will
if
you
will
only
tell
me
what
to
do
go
to
your
room
without
so
much
as
a
single
word
to
any
one
bolt
yourself
in
and
for
three
hours
now
read
the
lords
prayer
backwards
poor
annie
was
only
too
glad
to
escape
upon
these
conditions
and
the
counsellor
kissed
her
upon
the
forehead
and
told
her
not
to
make
her
eyes
red
because
they
were
much
too
sweet
and
pretty
she
dropped
them
at
this
with
a
sob
and
a
curtsey
and
ran
away
to
her
bedroom
but
as
for
reading
the
lords
prayer
backwards
that
was
much
beyond
her
and
she
had
not
done
three
words
quite
right
before
the
three
hours
expired
meanwhile
the
counsellor
was
gone
he
bade
our
mother
adieu
with
so
much
dignity
of
bearing
and
such
warmth
of
gratitude
and
the
highbred
courtesy
of
the
old
school
now
fast
disappearing
that
when
he
was
gone
dear
mother
fell
back
on
the
chair
which
he
had
used
last
night
as
if
it
would
teach
her
the
graces
and
for
more
than
an
hour
she
made
believe
not
to
know
what
there
was
for
dinner
oh
the
wickedness
of
the
world
oh
the
lies
that
are
told
of
peopleor
rather
i
mean
the
falsehoodsbecause
a
man
is
better
born
and
has
better
manners
why
lorna
how
is
it
that
you
never
speak
about
your
charming
uncle
did
you
notice
lizzie
how
his
silver
hair
was
waving
upon
his
velvet
collar
and
how
white
his
hands
were
and
every
nail
like
an
acorn
only
pink
like
shellfish
or
at
least
like
shells
and
the
way
he
bowed
and
dropped
his
eyes
from
his
pure
respect
for
me
and
then
that
he
would
not
even
speak
on
account
of
his
emotion
but
pressed
my
hand
in
silence
oh
lizzie
you
have
read
me
beautiful
things
about
sir
gallyhead
and
the
rest
but
nothing
to
equal
sir
counsellor
you
had
better
marry
him
madam
said
i
coming
in
very
sternly
though
i
knew
i
ought
not
to
say
it
he
can
repay
your
adoration
he
has
stolen
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
john
cried
my
mother
you
are
mad
and
yet
she
turned
as
pale
as
death
for
women
are
so
quick
at
turning
and
she
inkled
what
it
was
of
course
i
am
mother
mad
about
the
marvels
of
sir
galahad
he
has
gone
off
with
my
lornas
necklace
fifty
farms
like
ours
can
never
make
it
good
to
lorna
hereupon
ensued
grim
silence
mother
looked
at
lizzies
face
for
she
could
not
look
at
me
and
lizzie
looked
at
me
to
know
and
as
for
me
i
could
have
stamped
almost
on
the
heart
of
any
one
it
was
not
the
value
of
the
necklacei
am
not
so
low
a
hound
as
thatnor
was
it
even
the
damned
folly
shown
by
every
one
of
usit
was
the
thought
of
lornas
sorrow
for
her
ancient
plaything
and
even
more
my
fury
at
the
breach
of
hospitality
but
lorna
came
up
to
me
softly
as
a
woman
should
always
come
and
she
laid
one
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
she
only
looked
at
me
she
even
seemed
to
fear
to
look
and
dropped
her
eyes
and
sighed
at
me
without
a
word
i
knew
by
that
how
i
must
have
looked
like
satan
and
the
evil
spirit
left
my
heart
when
she
had
made
me
think
of
it
darling
john
did
you
want
me
to
think
that
you
cared
for
my
money
more
than
for
me
i
led
her
away
from
the
rest
of
them
being
desirous
of
explaining
things
when
i
saw
the
depth
of
her
nature
opened
like
an
everlasting
well
to
me
but
she
would
not
let
me
say
a
word
or
do
anything
by
ourselves
as
it
were
she
said
your
duty
is
to
your
mother
this
blow
is
on
her
and
not
on
me
i
saw
that
she
was
right
though
how
she
knew
it
is
beyond
me
and
i
asked
her
just
to
go
in
front
and
bring
my
mother
round
a
little
for
i
must
let
my
passion
pass
it
may
drop
its
weapons
quickly
but
it
cannot
come
and
go
before
a
man
has
time
to
think
then
lorna
went
up
to
my
mother
who
was
still
in
the
chair
of
elegance
and
she
took
her
by
both
hands
and
said
dearest
mother
i
shall
fret
so
if
i
see
you
fretting
and
to
fret
will
kill
me
mother
they
have
always
told
me
so
poor
mother
bent
on
lornas
shoulder
without
thought
of
attitude
and
laid
her
cheek
on
lornas
breast
and
sobbed
till
lizzie
was
jealous
and
came
with
two
pockethandkerchiefs
as
for
me
my
heart
was
lighter
if
they
would
only
dry
their
eyes
and
come
round
by
dinnertime
than
it
had
been
since
the
day
on
which
tom
faggus
discovered
the
value
of
that
blessed
and
cursed
necklace
none
could
say
that
i
wanted
lorna
for
her
money
now
and
perhaps
the
doones
would
let
me
have
her
now
that
her
property
was
gone
but
who
shall
tell
of
annies
grief
the
poor
little
thing
would
have
staked
her
life
upon
finding
the
trinket
in
all
its
beauty
lying
under
the
pannikin
she
proudly
challenged
me
to
lift
itwhich
i
had
done
long
ere
that
of
courseif
only
i
would
take
the
risk
of
the
spell
for
my
incredulity
i
told
her
not
to
talk
of
spells
until
she
could
spell
a
word
backwards
and
then
to
look
into
the
pan
where
the
charmed
cream
should
be
she
would
not
acknowledge
that
the
cream
was
the
same
as
all
the
rest
was
and
indeed
it
was
not
quite
the
same
for
the
points
of
poor
lornas
diamonds
had
made
a
few
starrays
across
the
rich
firm
crust
of
yellow
but
when
we
raised
the
pannikin
and
there
was
nothing
under
it
poor
annie
fell
against
the
wall
which
had
been
whitened
lately
and
her
face
put
all
the
white
to
scorn
my
love
who
was
as
fond
of
her
as
if
she
had
known
her
for
fifty
years
hereupon
ran
up
and
caught
her
and
abused
all
diamonds
i
will
dwell
no
more
upon
annies
grief
because
we
felt
it
all
so
much
but
i
could
not
help
telling
her
if
she
wanted
a
witch
to
seek
good
mother
melldrum
a
legitimate
performer
that
same
night
master
jeremy
stickles
of
whose
absence
the
counsellor
must
have
known
came
back
with
all
equipment
ready
for
the
grand
attack
now
the
doones
knew
quite
as
well
as
we
did
that
this
attack
was
threatening
and
that
but
for
the
wonderful
weather
it
would
have
been
made
long
ago
therefore
we
or
at
least
our
people
for
i
was
doubtful
about
going
were
sure
to
meet
with
a
good
resistance
and
due
preparation
it
was
very
strange
to
hear
and
see
and
quite
impossible
to
account
for
that
now
some
hundreds
of
country
people
who
feared
to
whisper
so
much
as
a
word
against
the
doones
a
year
ago
and
would
sooner
have
thought
of
attacking
a
church
in
service
time
than
glen
doone
now
sharpened
their
old
cutlasses
and
laid
pitchforks
on
the
grindstone
and
bragged
at
every
village
cross
as
if
each
would
kill
ten
doones
himself
neither
care
to
wipe
his
hands
afterwards
and
this
fierce
bravery
and
tall
contempt
had
been
growing
ever
since
the
news
of
the
attack
upon
our
premises
had
taken
good
people
by
surprise
at
least
as
concerned
the
issue
jeremy
stickles
laughed
heartily
about
annies
new
manner
of
charming
the
cream
but
he
looked
very
grave
at
the
loss
of
the
jewels
so
soon
as
he
knew
their
value
my
son
he
exclaimed
this
is
very
heavy
it
will
go
ill
with
all
of
you
to
make
good
this
loss
as
i
fear
that
you
will
have
to
do
what
cried
i
with
my
blood
running
cold
we
make
good
the
loss
master
stickles
every
farthing
we
have
in
the
world
and
the
labour
of
our
lives
to
boot
will
never
make
good
the
tenth
of
it
it
would
cut
me
to
the
heart
he
answered
laying
his
hand
on
mine
to
hear
of
such
a
deadly
blow
to
you
and
your
good
mother
and
this
farm
how
long
john
has
it
been
in
your
family
for
at
least
six
hundred
years
i
said
with
a
foolish
pride
that
was
only
too
like
to
end
in
groans
and
some
people
say
by
a
royal
grant
in
the
time
of
the
great
king
alfred
at
any
rate
a
ridd
was
with
him
throughout
all
his
hidingtime
we
have
always
held
by
the
king
and
crown
surely
none
will
turn
us
out
unless
we
are
guilty
of
treason
my
son
replied
jeremy
very
gently
so
that
i
could
love
him
for
it
not
a
word
to
your
good
mother
of
this
unlucky
matter
keep
it
to
yourself
my
boy
and
try
to
think
but
little
of
it
after
all
i
may
be
wrong
at
any
rate
least
said
best
mended
but
jeremy
dear
jeremy
how
can
i
bear
to
leave
it
so
do
you
suppose
that
i
can
sleep
and
eat
my
food
and
go
about
and
look
at
other
people
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
and
all
the
time
have
it
on
my
mind
that
not
an
acre
of
all
the
land
nor
even
our
old
sheepdog
belongs
to
us
of
right
at
all
it
is
more
than
i
can
do
jeremy
let
me
talk
and
know
the
worst
of
it
very
well
replied
master
stickles
seeing
that
both
the
doors
were
closed
i
thought
that
nothing
could
move
you
john
or
i
never
would
have
told
you
likely
enough
i
am
quite
wrong
and
god
send
that
i
be
so
but
what
i
guessed
at
some
time
back
seems
more
than
a
guess
now
that
you
have
told
me
about
these
wondrous
jewels
now
will
you
keep
as
close
as
death
every
word
i
tell
you
by
the
honour
of
a
man
i
will
until
you
yourself
release
me
that
is
quite
enough
john
from
you
i
want
no
oath
which
according
to
my
experience
tempts
a
man
to
lie
the
more
by
making
it
more
important
i
know
you
now
too
well
to
swear
you
though
i
have
the
power
now
my
lad
what
i
have
to
say
will
scare
your
mind
in
one
way
and
ease
it
in
another
i
think
that
you
have
been
hard
pressedi
can
read
you
like
a
book
johnby
something
which
that
old
villain
said
before
he
stole
the
necklace
you
have
tried
not
to
dwell
upon
it
you
have
even
tried
to
make
light
of
it
for
the
sake
of
the
women
but
on
the
whole
it
has
grieved
you
more
than
even
this
dastard
robbery
it
would
have
done
so
jeremy
stickles
if
i
could
once
have
believed
it
and
even
without
much
belief
it
is
so
against
our
manners
that
it
makes
me
miserable
only
think
of
loving
lorna
only
think
of
kissing
her
and
then
remembering
that
her
father
had
destroyed
the
life
of
mine
only
think
said
master
stickles
imitating
my
very
voice
of
lorna
loving
you
john
of
lorna
kissing
you
john
and
all
the
while
saying
to
herself
this
mans
father
murdered
mine
now
look
at
it
in
lornas
way
as
well
as
in
your
own
way
how
onesided
all
men
are
i
may
look
at
it
in
fifty
ways
and
yet
no
good
will
come
of
it
jeremy
i
confess
to
you
that
i
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
partly
to
baffle
the
counsellor
and
partly
because
my
darling
needed
my
help
and
bore
it
so
and
behaved
to
me
so
nobly
but
to
you
in
secret
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
a
woman
may
look
over
this
easier
than
a
man
may
because
her
nature
is
larger
my
son
when
she
truly
loves
although
her
mind
be
smaller
now
if
i
can
ease
you
from
this
secret
burden
will
you
bear
with
strength
and
courage
the
other
which
i
plant
on
you
i
will
do
my
best
said
i
no
man
can
do
more
said
he
and
so
began
his
story
chapter
liii
jeremy
finds
out
something
you
know
my
son
said
jeremy
stickles
with
a
good
pull
at
his
pipe
because
he
was
going
to
talk
so
much
and
putting
his
legs
well
along
the
settle
it
has
been
my
duty
for
a
wearier
time
than
i
care
to
think
of
and
which
would
have
been
unbearable
except
for
your
great
kindness
to
search
this
neighbourhood
narrowly
and
learn
everything
about
everybody
now
the
neighbourhood
itself
is
queer
and
people
have
different
ways
of
thinking
from
what
we
are
used
to
in
london
for
instance
now
among
your
folk
when
any
piece
of
news
is
told
or
any
mans
conduct
spoken
of
the
very
first
question
that
arises
in
your
mind
is
thiswas
this
action
kind
and
good
long
after
that
you
say
to
yourselves
does
the
law
enjoin
or
forbid
this
thing
now
here
is
your
fundamental
error
for
among
all
truly
civilised
people
the
foremost
of
all
questions
is
how
stands
the
law
herein
and
if
the
law
approve
no
need
for
any
further
questioning
that
this
is
so
you
may
take
my
word
for
i
know
the
law
pretty
thoroughly
very
well
i
need
not
say
any
more
about
that
for
i
have
shown
that
you
are
all
quite
wrong
i
only
speak
of
this
savage
tendency
because
it
explains
so
many
things
which
have
puzzled
me
among
you
and
most
of
all
your
kindness
to
men
whom
you
never
saw
before
which
is
an
utterly
illegal
thing
it
also
explains
your
toleration
of
these
outlaw
doones
so
long
if
your
views
of
law
had
been
correct
and
law
an
element
of
your
lives
these
robbers
could
never
have
been
indulged
for
so
many
years
amongst
you
but
you
must
have
abated
the
nuisance
now
stickles
i
cried
this
is
too
bad
he
was
delivering
himself
so
grandly
why
you
yourself
have
been
amongst
us
as
the
balance
and
sceptre
and
sword
of
law
for
nigh
upon
a
twelvemonth
and
have
you
abated
the
nuisance
or
even
cared
to
do
it
until
they
began
to
shoot
at
you
my
son
he
replied
your
argument
is
quite
beside
the
purpose
and
only
tends
to
prove
more
clearly
that
which
i
have
said
of
you
however
if
you
wish
to
hear
my
story
no
more
interruptions
i
may
not
have
a
chance
to
tell
you
perhaps
for
weeks
or
i
know
not
when
if
once
those
yellows
and
reds
arrive
and
be
blessed
to
them
the
lubbers
well
it
may
be
six
months
ago
or
it
may
be
seven
at
any
rate
a
good
while
before
that
cursed
frost
began
the
mere
name
of
which
sends
a
shiver
down
every
bone
of
my
body
when
i
was
riding
one
afternoon
from
dulverton
to
watchett
dulverton
to
watchett
i
cried
now
what
does
that
remind
me
of
i
am
sure
i
remember
something
remember
this
john
if
anythingthat
another
word
from
thee
and
thou
hast
no
more
of
mine
well
i
was
a
little
weary
perhaps
having
been
plagued
at
dulverton
with
the
grossness
of
the
people
for
they
would
tell
me
nothing
at
all
about
their
fellowtownsmen
your
worthy
uncle
huckaback
except
that
he
was
a
godfearing
man
and
they
only
wished
i
was
like
him
i
blessed
myself
for
a
stupid
fool
in
thinking
to
have
pumped
them
for
by
this
time
i
might
have
known
that
through
your
western
homeliness
every
man
in
his
own
country
is
something
more
than
a
prophet
and
i
felt
of
course
that
i
had
done
more
harm
than
good
by
questioning
inasmuch
as
every
soul
in
the
place
would
run
straightway
and
inform
him
that
the
kings
man
from
the
other
side
of
the
forest
had
been
sifting
out
his
ways
and
works
ah
i
cried
for
i
could
not
help
it
you
begin
to
understand
at
last
that
we
are
not
quite
such
a
set
of
oafs
as
you
at
first
believed
us
i
was
riding
on
from
dulverton
he
resumed
with
great
severity
yet
threatening
me
no
more
which
checked
me
more
than
fifty
threats
and
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
i
was
growing
weary
the
road
if
road
it
could
be
called
turned
suddenly
down
from
the
higher
land
to
the
very
brink
of
the
sea
and
rounding
a
little
jut
of
cliff
i
met
the
roar
of
the
breakers
my
horse
was
scared
and
leaped
aside
for
a
northerly
wind
was
piping
and
driving
hunks
of
foam
across
as
children
scatter
snowballs
but
he
only
sank
to
his
fetlocks
in
the
dry
sand
piled
with
popweed
and
i
tried
to
make
him
face
the
waves
and
then
i
looked
about
me
watchett
town
was
not
to
be
seen
on
account
of
a
little
foreland
a
mile
or
more
upon
my
course
and
standing
to
the
right
of
me
there
was
room
enough
below
the
cliffs
which
are
nothing
there
to
yours
john
for
horse
and
man
to
get
along
although
the
tide
was
running
high
with
a
northerly
gale
to
back
it
but
close
at
hand
and
in
the
corner
drawn
above
the
yellow
sands
and
long
eyebrows
of
rackweed
as
snug
a
little
house
blinked
on
me
as
ever
i
saw
or
wished
to
see
you
know
that
i
am
not
luxurious
neither
in
any
way
given
to
the
common
lusts
of
the
flesh
john
my
father
never
allowed
his
hair
to
grow
a
fourth
part
of
an
inch
in
length
and
he
was
a
thoroughly
godly
man
and
i
try
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
whenever
i
think
about
it
nevertheless
i
do
assure
you
that
my
view
of
that
little
house
and
the
way
the
lights
were
twinkling
so
different
from
the
cold
and
darkness
of
the
rolling
sea
moved
the
ancient
adam
in
me
if
he
could
be
found
to
move
i
love
not
a
house
with
too
many
windows
being
out
of
house
and
doors
some
threequarters
of
my
time
when
i
get
inside
a
house
i
like
to
feel
the
difference
air
and
light
are
good
for
people
who
have
any
lack
of
them
and
if
a
man
once
talks
about
them
tis
enough
to
prove
his
need
of
them
but
as
you
well
know
john
ridd
the
horse
who
has
been
at
work
all
day
with
the
sunshine
in
his
eyes
sleeps
better
in
dark
stables
and
needs
no
moon
to
help
him
seeing
therefore
that
this
same
inn
had
four
windows
and
no
more
i
thought
to
myself
how
snug
it
was
and
how
beautiful
i
could
sleep
there
and
so
i
made
the
old
horse
draw
hand
which
he
was
only
too
glad
to
do
and
we
clomb
above
the
springtide
mark
and
over
a
little
piece
of
turf
and
struck
the
door
of
the
hostelry
some
one
came
and
peeped
at
me
through
the
lattice
overhead
which
was
full
of
bulls
eyes
and
then
the
bolt
was
drawn
back
and
a
woman
met
me
very
courteously
a
dark
and
foreignlooking
woman
very
hot
of
blood
i
doubt
but
not
altogether
a
bad
one
and
she
waited
for
me
to
speak
first
which
an
englishwoman
would
not
have
done
can
i
rest
here
for
the
night
i
asked
with
a
lift
of
my
hat
to
her
for
she
was
no
provincial
dame
who
would
stare
at
me
for
the
courtesy
my
horse
is
weary
from
the
sloughs
and
myself
but
little
better
beside
that
we
both
are
famished
yes
sir
you
can
rest
and
welcome
but
of
food
i
fear
there
is
but
little
unless
of
the
common
order
our
fishers
would
have
drawn
the
nets
but
the
waves
were
violent
however
we
havewhat
you
call
it
i
never
can
remember
it
is
so
hard
to
saythe
flesh
of
the
hog
salted
bacon
said
i
what
can
be
better
and
half
dozen
of
eggs
with
it
and
a
quart
of
freshdrawn
ale
you
make
me
rage
with
hunger
madam
is
it
cruelty
or
hospitality
ah
good
she
replied
with
a
merry
smile
full
of
southern
sunshine
you
are
not
of
the
men
round
here
you
can
think
and
you
can
laugh
and
most
of
all
i
can
eat
good
madam
in
that
way
i
shall
astonish
you
even
more
than
by
my
intellect
she
laughed
aloud
and
swung
her
shoulders
as
your
natives
cannot
do
and
then
she
called
a
little
maid
to
lead
my
horse
to
stable
however
i
preferred
to
see
that
matter
done
myself
and
told
her
to
send
the
little
maid
for
the
fryingpan
and
the
eggbox
whether
it
were
my
natural
wit
and
elegance
of
manner
or
whether
it
were
my
london
freedom
and
knowledge
of
the
world
or
which
is
perhaps
the
most
probable
because
the
least
pleasing
supposition
my
ready
and
permanent
appetite
and
appreciation
of
garlici
leave
you
to
decide
john
but
perhaps
all
three
combined
to
recommend
me
to
the
graces
of
my
charming
hostess
when
i
say
charming
i
mean
of
course
by
manners
and
by
intelligence
and
most
of
all
by
cooking
for
as
regards
external
charms
most
fleeting
and
fallacious
hers
had
ceased
to
cause
distress
for
i
cannot
say
how
many
years
she
said
that
it
was
the
climatefor
even
upon
that
subject
she
requested
my
opinionand
i
answered
if
there
be
a
change
let
madam
blame
the
seasons
however
not
to
dwell
too
much
upon
our
little
pleasantries
for
i
always
get
on
with
these
foreign
women
better
than
with
your
molls
and
pegs
i
became
not
inquisitive
but
reasonably
desirous
to
know
by
what
strange
hap
or
hazard
a
clever
and
a
handsome
woman
as
she
must
have
been
some
day
a
woman
moreover
with
great
contempt
for
the
rustic
minds
around
her
could
have
settled
here
in
this
lonely
inn
with
only
the
waves
for
company
and
a
boorish
husband
who
slaved
all
day
in
turning
a
potters
wheel
at
watchett
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
emblem
set
above
her
doorway
a
very
unattractive
cat
sitting
in
a
ruined
tree
however
i
had
not
very
long
to
strain
my
curiosity
for
when
she
found
out
who
i
was
and
how
i
held
the
kings
commission
and
might
be
called
an
officer
her
desire
to
tell
me
all
was
more
than
equal
to
mine
of
hearing
it
many
and
many
a
day
she
had
longed
for
some
one
both
skilful
and
trustworthy
most
of
all
for
some
one
bearing
warrant
from
a
court
of
justice
but
the
magistrates
of
the
neighbourhood
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
declaring
that
she
was
a
crackbrained
woman
and
a
wicked
and
even
a
foreign
one
with
many
grimaces
she
assured
me
that
never
by
her
own
freewill
would
she
have
lived
so
many
years
in
that
hateful
country
where
the
sky
for
half
the
year
was
fog
and
rain
for
nearly
the
other
half
it
was
so
the
very
night
when
first
her
evil
fortune
brought
her
there
and
so
no
doubt
it
would
be
long
after
it
had
killed
her
but
if
i
wished
to
know
the
reason
of
her
being
there
she
would
tell
me
in
few
words
which
i
will
repeat
as
briefly
by
birth
she
was
an
italian
from
the
mountains
of
apulia
who
had
gone
to
rome
to
seek
her
fortunes
after
being
badly
treated
in
some
loveaffair
her
christian
name
was
benita
as
for
her
surname
that
could
make
no
difference
to
any
one
being
a
quick
and
active
girl
and
resolved
to
work
down
her
troubles
she
found
employment
in
a
large
hotel
and
rising
gradually
began
to
send
money
to
her
parents
and
here
she
might
have
thriven
well
and
married
well
under
sunny
skies
and
been
a
happy
woman
but
that
some
black
day
sent
thither
a
rich
and
noble
english
family
eager
to
behold
the
pope
it
was
not
however
their
fervent
longing
for
the
holy
father
which
had
brought
them
to
st
peters
roof
but
rather
their
own
bad
luck
in
making
their
home
too
hot
to
hold
them
for
although
in
the
main
good
catholics
and
pleasant
receivers
of
anything
one
of
their
number
had
given
offence
by
the
folly
of
trying
to
think
for
himself
some
bitter
feud
had
been
among
them
benita
knew
not
how
it
was
and
the
sister
of
the
nobleman
who
had
died
quite
lately
was
married
to
the
rival
claimant
whom
they
all
detested
it
was
something
about
dividing
land
benita
knew
not
what
it
was
but
this
benita
did
know
that
they
were
all
great
people
and
rich
and
very
liberal
so
that
when
they
offered
to
take
her
to
attend
to
the
children
and
to
speak
the
language
for
them
and
to
comfort
the
lady
she
was
only
too
glad
to
go
little
foreseeing
the
end
of
it
moreover
she
loved
the
children
so
from
their
pretty
ways
and
that
and
the
things
they
gave
her
and
the
style
of
their
dresses
that
it
would
have
broken
her
heart
almost
never
to
see
the
dears
again
and
so
in
a
very
evil
hour
she
accepted
the
service
of
the
noble
englishman
and
sent
her
father
an
old
shoe
filled
to
the
tongue
with
money
and
trusted
herself
to
fortune
but
even
before
she
went
she
knew
that
it
could
not
turn
out
well
for
the
laurel
leaf
which
she
threw
on
the
fire
would
not
crackle
even
once
and
the
horn
of
the
goat
came
wrong
in
the
twist
and
the
heel
of
her
foot
was
shining
this
made
her
sigh
at
the
startingtime
and
after
that
what
could
you
hope
for
however
at
first
all
things
went
well
my
lord
was
as
gay
as
gay
could
be
and
never
would
come
inside
the
carriage
when
a
decent
horse
could
be
got
to
ride
he
would
gallop
in
front
at
a
reckless
pace
without
a
weapon
of
any
kind
delighted
with
the
pure
blue
air
and
throwing
his
heart
around
him
benita
had
never
seen
any
man
so
admirable
and
so
childish
as
innocent
as
an
infant
and
not
only
contented
but
noisily
happy
with
anything
only
other
people
must
share
his
joy
and
the
shadow
of
sorrow
scattered
it
though
it
were
but
the
shade
of
poverty
here
benita
wept
a
little
and
i
liked
her
none
the
less
and
believed
her
ten
times
more
in
virtue
of
a
tear
or
two
and
so
they
travelled
through
northern
italy
and
throughout
the
south
of
france
making
their
way
anyhow
sometimes
in
coaches
sometimes
in
carts
sometimes
upon
muleback
sometimes
even
afoot
and
weary
but
always
as
happy
as
could
be
the
children
laughed
and
grew
and
throve
especially
the
young
lady
the
elder
of
the
two
and
benita
began
to
think
that
omens
must
not
be
relied
upon
but
suddenly
her
faith
in
omens
was
confirmed
for
ever
my
lord
who
was
quite
a
young
man
still
and
laughed
at
english
arrogance
rode
on
in
front
of
his
wife
and
friends
to
catch
the
first
of
a
famous
view
on
the
french
side
of
the
pyrenee
hills
he
kissed
his
hand
to
his
wife
and
said
that
he
would
save
her
the
trouble
of
coming
for
those
two
were
so
one
in
one
that
they
could
make
each
other
know
whatever
he
or
she
had
felt
and
so
my
lord
went
round
the
corner
with
a
fine
young
horse
leaping
up
at
the
steps
they
waited
for
him
long
and
long
but
he
never
came
again
and
within
a
week
his
mangled
body
lay
in
a
little
chapelyard
and
if
the
priests
only
said
a
quarter
of
the
prayers
they
took
the
money
for
god
knows
they
can
have
no
throats
left
only
a
relaxation
my
lady
dwelled
for
six
months
moreit
is
a
melancholy
tale
what
true
tale
is
not
soscarcely
able
to
believe
that
all
her
fright
was
not
a
dream
she
would
not
wear
a
piece
or
shape
of
any
mourningclothes
she
would
not
have
a
person
cry
or
any
sorrow
among
us
she
simply
disbelieved
the
thing
and
trusted
god
to
right
it
the
protestants
who
have
no
faith
cannot
understand
this
feeling
enough
that
so
it
was
and
so
my
lady
went
to
heaven
for
when
the
snow
came
down
in
autumn
on
the
roots
of
the
pyrenees
and
the
chapelyard
was
white
with
it
many
people
told
the
lady
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
and
the
strongest
plea
of
all
was
this
that
now
she
bore
another
hope
of
repeating
her
husbands
virtues
so
at
the
end
of
october
when
wolves
came
down
to
the
farmlands
the
little
english
family
went
home
towards
their
england
they
landed
somewhere
on
the
devonshire
coast
ten
or
eleven
years
agone
and
stayed
some
days
at
exeter
and
set
out
thence
in
a
hired
coach
without
any
proper
attendance
for
watchett
in
the
north
of
somerset
for
the
lady
owned
a
quiet
mansion
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
town
and
her
one
desire
was
to
find
refuge
there
and
to
meet
her
lord
who
was
sure
to
come
she
said
when
he
heard
of
his
new
infant
therefore
with
only
two
servingmen
and
two
maids
including
benita
the
party
set
forth
from
exeter
and
lay
the
first
night
at
bampton
on
the
following
morn
they
started
bravely
with
earnest
hope
of
arriving
at
their
journeys
end
by
daylight
but
the
roads
were
soft
and
very
deep
and
the
sloughs
were
out
in
places
and
the
heavy
coach
broke
down
in
the
axle
and
needed
mending
at
dulverton
and
so
they
lost
three
hours
or
more
and
would
have
been
wiser
to
sleep
there
but
her
ladyship
would
not
hear
of
it
she
must
be
home
that
night
she
said
and
her
husband
would
be
waiting
how
could
she
keep
him
waiting
now
after
such
a
long
long
time
therefore
although
it
was
afternoon
and
the
year
now
come
to
december
the
horses
were
put
to
again
and
the
heavy
coach
went
up
the
hill
with
the
lady
and
her
two
children
and
benita
sitting
inside
of
it
the
other
maid
and
two
servingmen
each
man
with
a
great
blunderbuss
mounted
upon
the
outside
and
upon
the
horses
three
exeter
postilions
much
had
been
said
at
dulverton
and
even
back
at
bampton
about
some
great
freebooters
to
whom
all
exmoor
owed
suit
and
service
and
paid
them
very
punctually
both
the
servingmen
were
scared
even
over
their
ale
by
this
but
the
lady
only
said
drive
on
i
know
a
little
of
highwaymen
they
never
rob
a
lady
through
the
fog
and
through
the
muck
the
coach
went
on
as
best
it
might
sometimes
foundered
in
a
slough
with
half
of
the
horses
splashing
it
and
sometimes
knuckled
up
on
a
bank
and
straining
across
the
middle
while
all
the
horses
kicked
at
it
however
they
went
on
till
dark
as
well
as
might
be
expected
but
when
they
came
all
thanking
god
to
the
pitch
and
slope
of
the
seabank
leading
on
towards
watchett
town
and
where
my
horse
had
shied
so
there
the
little
boy
jumped
up
and
clapped
his
hands
at
the
water
and
there
as
benita
said
they
met
their
fate
and
could
not
fly
it
although
it
was
past
the
dusk
of
day
the
silver
light
from
the
sea
flowed
in
and
showed
the
cliffs
and
the
gray
sandline
and
the
drifts
of
wreck
and
wrackweed
it
showed
them
also
a
troop
of
horsemen
waiting
under
a
rock
hard
by
and
ready
to
dash
upon
them
the
postilions
lashed
towards
the
sea
and
the
horses
strove
in
the
depth
of
sand
and
the
servingmen
cocked
their
blunderbusses
and
cowered
away
behind
them
but
the
lady
stood
up
in
the
carriage
bravely
and
neither
screamed
nor
spoke
but
hid
her
son
behind
her
meanwhile
the
drivers
drove
into
the
sea
till
the
leading
horses
were
swimming
but
before
the
waves
came
into
the
coach
a
score
of
fierce
men
were
round
it
they
cursed
the
postilions
for
mad
cowards
and
cut
the
traces
and
seized
the
wheelhorses
allwild
with
dismay
in
the
wet
and
the
dark
then
while
the
carriage
was
heeling
over
and
wellnigh
upset
in
the
water
the
lady
exclaimed
i
know
that
man
he
is
our
ancient
enemy
and
benita
foreseeing
that
all
their
boxes
would
be
turned
inside
out
or
carried
away
snatched
the
most
valuable
of
the
jewels
a
magnificent
necklace
of
diamonds
and
cast
it
over
the
little
girls
head
and
buried
it
under
her
travellingcloak
hoping
to
save
it
then
a
great
wave
crested
with
foam
rolled
in
and
the
coach
was
thrown
on
its
side
and
the
sea
rushed
in
at
the
top
and
the
windows
upon
shrieking
and
clashing
and
fainting
away
what
followed
benita
knew
not
as
one
might
well
suppose
herself
being
stunned
by
a
blow
on
the
head
beside
being
palsied
with
terror
see
i
have
the
mark
now
she
said
where
the
jamb
of
the
door
came
down
on
me
but
when
she
recovered
her
senses
she
found
herself
lying
upon
the
sand
the
robbers
were
out
of
sight
and
one
of
the
servingmen
was
bathing
her
forehead
with
sea
water
for
this
she
rated
him
well
having
taken
already
too
much
of
that
article
and
then
she
arose
and
ran
to
her
mistress
who
was
sitting
upright
on
a
little
rock
with
her
dead
boys
face
to
her
bosom
sometimes
gazing
upon
him
and
sometimes
questing
round
for
the
other
one
although
there
were
torches
and
links
around
and
she
looked
at
her
child
by
the
light
of
them
no
one
dared
to
approach
the
lady
or
speak
or
try
to
help
her
each
man
whispered
his
fellow
to
go
but
each
hung
back
himself
and
muttered
that
it
was
too
awful
to
meddle
with
and
there
she
would
have
sat
all
night
with
the
fine
little
fellow
stone
dead
in
her
arms
and
her
tearless
eyes
dwelling
upon
him
and
her
heart
but
not
her
mind
thinking
only
that
the
italian
women
stole
up
softly
to
her
side
and
whispered
it
is
the
will
of
god
so
it
always
seems
to
be
were
all
the
words
the
mother
answered
and
then
she
fell
on
benitas
neck
and
the
men
were
ashamed
to
be
near
her
weeping
and
a
sailor
lay
down
and
bellowed
surely
these
men
are
the
best
before
the
light
of
the
morning
came
along
the
tide
to
watchett
my
lady
had
met
her
husband
they
took
her
into
the
town
that
night
but
not
to
her
own
castle
and
so
the
power
of
womanhood
which
is
itself
maternity
came
over
swiftly
upon
her
the
lady
whom
all
people
loved
though
at
certain
times
particular
lies
in
watchett
little
churchyard
with
son
and
heir
at
her
right
hand
and
a
little
babe
of
sex
unknown
sleeping
on
her
bosom
this
is
a
miserable
tale
said
jeremy
stickles
brightly
hand
me
over
the
schnapps
my
boy
what
fools
we
are
to
spoil
our
eyes
for
other
peoples
troubles
enough
of
our
own
to
keep
them
clean
although
we
all
were
chimneysweeps
there
is
nothing
like
good
hollands
when
a
man
becomes
too
sensitive
restore
the
action
of
the
glands
that
is
my
rule
after
weeping
let
me
make
you
another
john
you
are
quite
lowspirited
but
although
master
jeremy
carried
on
so
as
became
his
manhood
and
laughed
at
the
sailors
bellowing
bless
his
heart
i
knew
as
well
that
tears
were
in
his
brave
keen
eyes
as
if
i
had
dared
to
look
for
them
or
to
show
mine
own
and
what
was
the
ladys
name
i
asked
and
what
became
of
the
little
girl
and
why
did
the
woman
stay
there
well
cried
jeremy
stickles
only
too
glad
to
be
cheerful
again
talk
of
a
woman
after
that
as
we
used
to
say
at
schoolwho
dragged
whom
how
many
times
in
what
manner
round
the
wall
of
what
but
to
begin
last
first
my
john
as
becomes
a
woman
benita
stayed
in
that
blessed
place
because
she
could
not
get
away
from
it
the
doonesif
doones
indeed
they
were
about
which
you
of
course
know
besttook
every
stiver
out
of
the
carriage
wet
or
dry
they
took
it
and
benita
could
never
get
her
wages
for
the
whole
affair
is
in
chancery
and
they
have
appointed
a
receiver
whew
said
i
knowing
something
of
london
and
sorry
for
benitas
chance
so
the
poor
thing
was
compelled
to
drop
all
thought
of
apulia
and
settle
down
on
the
brink
of
exmoor
where
you
get
all
its
evils
without
the
good
to
balance
them
she
married
a
man
who
turned
a
wheel
for
making
the
blue
watchett
ware
partly
because
he
could
give
her
a
house
and
partly
because
he
proved
himself
a
good
soul
towards
my
lady
there
they
are
and
have
three
children
and
there
you
may
go
and
visit
them
i
understand
all
that
jeremy
though
you
do
tell
things
too
quickly
and
i
would
rather
have
john
frys
style
for
he
leaves
one
time
for
his
words
to
melt
now
for
my
second
question
what
became
of
the
little
maid
you
great
oaf
cried
jeremy
stickles
you
are
rather
more
likely
to
know
i
should
think
than
any
one
else
in
all
the
kingdoms
if
i
knew
i
should
not
ask
you
jeremy
stickles
do
try
to
be
neither
conceited
nor
thickheaded
i
will
when
you
are
neither
answered
master
jeremy
but
you
occupy
all
the
room
john
no
one
else
can
get
in
with
you
there
very
well
then
let
me
out
take
me
down
in
both
ways
if
ever
you
were
taken
down
you
must
have
your
double
joints
ready
now
and
yet
in
other
ways
you
will
be
as
proud
and
set
up
as
lucifer
as
certain
sure
as
i
stand
here
that
little
maid

chapter
liv
mutual
discomfiture
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
was
altogether
so
thickheaded
as
jeremy
would
have
made
me
out
but
it
is
part
of
my
character
that
i
like
other
people
to
think
me
slow
and
to
labour
hard
to
enlighten
me
while
all
the
time
i
can
say
to
myself
this
man
is
shallower
than
i
am
it
is
pleasant
to
see
his
shoals
come
up
while
he
is
sounding
mine
so
not
that
i
would
so
behave
god
forbid
with
anybody
be
it
man
or
woman
who
in
simple
heart
approached
me
with
no
gauge
of
intellect
but
when
the
upper
hand
is
taken
upon
the
faith
of
ones
patience
by
a
man
of
even
smaller
wits
not
that
jeremy
was
that
neither
could
he
have
lived
to
be
thought
so
why
it
naturally
happens
that
we
knuckle
under
with
an
ounce
of
indignation
jeremys
tale
would
have
moved
me
greatly
both
with
sorrow
and
anger
even
without
my
guess
at
first
and
now
my
firm
belief
that
the
child
of
those
unlucky
parents
was
indeed
my
lorna
and
as
i
thought
of
the
ladys
troubles
and
her
faith
in
providence
and
her
cruel
childless
death
and
then
imagined
how
my
darling
would
be
overcome
to
hear
it
you
may
well
believe
that
my
quick
replies
to
jeremy
stickless
banter
were
but
as
the
flourish
of
a
drum
to
cover
the
sounds
of
pain
for
when
he
described
the
heavy
coach
and
the
persons
in
and
upon
it
and
the
breaking
down
at
dulverton
and
the
place
of
their
destination
as
well
as
the
time
and
the
weather
and
the
season
of
the
year
my
heart
began
to
burn
within
me
and
my
mind
replaced
the
pictures
first
of
the
foreign
ladysmaid
by
the
pump
caressing
me
and
then
of
the
coach
struggling
up
the
hill
and
the
beautiful
dame
and
the
fine
little
boy
with
the
white
cockade
in
his
hat
but
most
of
all
the
little
girl
darkhaired
and
very
lovely
and
having
even
in
those
days
the
rich
soft
look
of
lorna
but
when
he
spoke
of
the
necklace
thrown
over
the
head
of
the
little
maiden
and
of
her
disappearance
before
my
eyes
arose
at
once
the
flashing
of
the
beaconfire
the
lonely
moors
embrowned
with
the
light
the
tramp
of
the
outlaw
cavalcade
and
the
helpless
child
headdownward
lying
across
the
robbers
saddlebow
then
i
remembered
my
own
mad
shout
of
boyish
indignation
and
marvelled
at
the
strange
long
way
by
which
the
events
of
life
come
round
and
while
i
thought
of
my
own
return
and
childish
attempt
to
hide
myself
from
sorrow
in
the
sawpit
and
the
agony
of
my
mothers
tears
it
did
not
fail
to
strike
me
as
a
thing
of
omen
that
the
selfsame
day
should
be
both
to
my
darling
and
myself
the
blackest
and
most
miserable
of
all
youthful
days
the
kings
commissioner
thought
it
wise
for
some
good
reason
of
his
own
to
conceal
from
me
for
the
present
the
name
of
the
poor
lady
supposed
to
be
lornas
mother
and
knowing
that
i
could
easily
now
discover
it
without
him
i
let
that
question
abide
awhile
indeed
i
was
half
afraid
to
hear
it
remembering
that
the
nobler
and
the
wealthier
she
proved
to
be
the
smaller
was
my
chance
of
winning
such
a
wife
for
plain
john
ridd
not
that
she
would
give
me
up
that
i
never
dreamed
of
but
that
others
would
interfere
or
indeed
i
myself
might
find
it
only
honest
to
relinquish
her
that
last
thought
was
a
dreadful
blow
and
took
my
breath
away
from
me
jeremy
stickles
was
quite
decidedand
of
course
the
discovery
being
his
he
had
a
right
to
be
sothat
not
a
word
of
all
these
things
must
be
imparted
to
lorna
herself
or
even
to
my
mother
or
any
one
whatever
keep
it
tight
as
wax
my
lad
he
cried
with
a
wink
of
great
expression
this
belongs
to
me
mind
and
the
credit
ay
and
the
premium
and
the
right
of
discount
are
altogether
mine
it
would
have
taken
you
fifty
years
to
put
two
and
two
together
so
as
i
did
like
a
clap
of
thunder
ah
god
has
given
some
men
brains
and
others
have
good
farms
and
money
and
a
certain
skill
in
the
lower
beasts
each
must
use
his
special
talent
you
work
your
farm
i
work
my
brains
in
the
end
my
lad
i
shall
beat
you
then
jeremy
what
a
fool
you
must
be
if
you
cudgel
your
brains
to
make
money
of
this
to
open
the
barndoor
to
me
and
show
me
all
your
threshing
not
a
whit
my
son
quite
the
opposite
two
men
always
thresh
better
than
one
and
here
i
have
you
bound
to
use
your
flail
one
two
with
mine
and
yet
in
strictest
honour
bound
not
to
bushel
up
till
i
tell
you
but
said
i
being
much
amused
by
a
londoners
brave
yet
uncertain
use
of
simplest
rural
metaphors
for
he
had
wholly
forgotten
the
winnowing
surely
if
i
bushel
up
even
when
you
tell
me
i
must
take
halfmeasure
so
you
shall
my
boy
he
answered
if
we
can
only
cheat
those
confounded
knaves
of
equity
you
shall
take
the
beauty
my
son
and
the
elegance
and
the
love
and
all
thatand
my
boy
i
will
take
the
money
this
he
said
in
a
way
so
dry
and
yet
so
richly
unctuous
that
being
gifted
somehow
by
god
with
a
kind
of
sense
of
queerness
i
fell
back
in
my
chair
and
laughed
though
the
underside
of
my
laugh
was
tears
now
jeremy
how
if
i
refuse
to
keep
this
half
as
tight
as
wax
you
bound
me
to
no
such
partnership
before
you
told
the
story
and
i
am
not
sure
by
any
means
of
your
right
to
do
so
afterwards
tush
he
replied
i
know
you
too
well
to
look
for
meanness
in
you
if
from
pure
goodwill
john
ridd
and
anxiety
to
relieve
you
i
made
no
condition
precedent
you
are
not
the
man
to
take
advantage
as
a
lawyer
might
i
do
not
even
want
your
promise
as
sure
as
i
hold
this
glass
and
drink
your
health
and
love
in
another
drop
forced
on
me
by
pathetic
words
so
surely
will
you
be
bound
to
me
until
i
do
release
you
tush
i
know
men
well
by
this
time
a
mere
look
of
trust
from
one
is
worth
anothers
ten
thousand
oaths
jeremy
you
are
right
i
answered
at
least
as
regards
the
issue
although
perhaps
you
were
not
right
in
leading
me
into
a
bargain
like
this
without
my
own
consent
or
knowledge
but
supposing
that
we
should
both
be
shot
in
this
grand
attack
on
the
valley
for
i
mean
to
go
with
you
now
heart
and
soul
is
lorna
to
remain
untold
of
that
which
changes
all
her
life
both
shot
cried
jeremy
stickles
my
goodness
boy
talk
not
like
that
and
those
doones
are
cursed
good
shots
too
nay
nay
the
yellows
shall
go
in
front
we
attack
on
the
somerset
side
i
think
i
from
a
hill
will
reconnoitre
as
behoves
a
general
you
shall
stick
behind
a
tree
if
we
can
only
find
one
big
enough
to
hide
you
you
and
i
to
be
shot
john
ridd
with
all
this
inferior
food
for
powder
anxious
to
be
devoured
i
laughed
for
i
knew
his
cool
hardihood
and
neverflinching
courage
and
sooth
to
say
no
coward
would
have
dared
to
talk
like
that
but
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
he
continued
smiling
at
himself
some
provision
should
be
made
for
even
that
unpleasant
chance
i
will
leave
the
whole
in
writing
with
orders
to
be
opened
etc
etcnow
no
more
of
that
my
boy
a
cigarro
after
schnapps
and
go
to
meet
my
yellow
boys
his
yellow
boys
as
he
called
the
somersetshire
trained
bands
were
even
now
coming
down
the
valley
from
the
london
road
as
every
one
since
i
went
up
to
town
grandly
entitled
the
lane
to
the
moors
there
was
one
good
point
about
these
men
that
having
no
discipline
at
all
they
made
pretence
to
none
whatever
nay
rather
they
ridiculed
the
thing
as
below
men
of
any
spirit
on
the
other
hand
master
stickless
troopers
looked
down
on
these
native
fellows
from
a
height
which
i
hope
they
may
never
tumble
for
it
would
break
the
necks
of
all
of
them
now
these
fine
natives
came
along
singing
for
their
very
lives
a
song
the
like
of
which
set
down
here
would
oust
my
book
from
modest
people
and
make
everybody
say
this
man
never
can
have
loved
lorna
therefore
the
less
of
that
the
better
only
i
thought
what
a
difference
from
the
goodly
psalms
of
the
ale
house
having
finished
their
canticle
which
contained
more
mirth
than
melody
they
drew
themselves
up
in
a
sort
of
way
supposed
by
them
to
be
military
each
man
with
heel
and
elbow
struck
into
those
of
his
neighbour
and
saluted
the
kings
commissioner
why
where
are
your
officers
asked
master
stickles
how
is
it
that
you
have
no
officers
upon
this
there
arose
a
general
grin
and
a
knowing
look
passed
along
their
faces
even
up
to
the
man
by
the
gatepost
are
you
going
to
tell
me
or
not
said
jeremy
what
is
become
of
your
officers
plaise
zur
said
one
little
fellow
at
last
being
nodded
at
by
the
rest
to
speak
in
right
of
his

cried
jeremy
scarce
knowing
whether
to
laugh
or
to
swear
or
what
to
do
that
your
officers
took
their
dismissal
thus
and
let
you
come
on
without
them
what
could
em

asked
the
little
man
with
reason
certainly
on
his
side
hus
zent
em
about
their
business
and
they
was
glad
enough
to
goo
well
said
poor
jeremy
turning
to
me
a
pretty
state
of
things
john
threescore
cobblers
and
farming
men
plasterers
tailors
and
kettlestomend
and
not
a
man
to
keep
order
among
them
except
my
blessed
self
john
and
i
trow
there
is
not
one
among
them
could
hit
all
indoor
flying
the
doones
will
make
riddles
of
all
of
us
however
he
had
better
hopes
when
the
sons
of
devon
appeared
as
they
did
in
about
an
hours
time
fine
fellows
and
eager
to
prove
themselves
these
had
not
discarded
their
officers
but
marched
in
good
obedience
to
them
and
were
quite
prepared
to
fight
the
men
of
somerset
if
need
be
in
addition
to
the
doones
and
there
was
scarcely
a
man
among
them
but
could
have
trounced
three
of
the
yellow
men
and
would
have
done
it
gladly
too
in
honour
of
the
red
facings
do
you
mean
to
suppose
master
jeremy
stickles
said
i
looking
on
with
amazement
beholding
also
all
our
maidens
at
the
upstair
windows
wondering
that
we
my
mother
a
widow
woman
and
i
a
young
man
of
small
estate
can
keep
and
support
all
these
precious
fellows
both
yellow
ones
and
red
ones
until
they
have
taken
the
doone
glen
god
forbid
it
my
son
he
replied
laying
a
finger
upon
his
lip
nay
nay
i
am
not
of
the
shabby
order
when
i
have
the
strings
of
government
kill
your
sheep
at
famine
prices
and
knead
your
bread
at
a
figure
expressing
the
rigours
of
last
winter
let
annie
make
out
the
bill
every
day
and
i
at
night
will
double
it
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
master
john
this
springharvest
shall
bring
you
in
three
times
as
much
as
last
autumns
did
if
they
cheated
you
in
town
my
lad
you
shall
have
your
change
in
the
country
take
thy
bill
and
write
down
quickly
however
this
did
not
meet
my
views
of
what
an
honest
man
should
do
and
i
went
to
consult
my
mother
about
it
as
all
the
accounts
would
be
made
in
her
name
dear
mother
thought
that
if
the
king
paid
only
half
again
as
much
as
other
people
would
have
to
pay
it
would
be
perhaps
the
proper
thing
the
half
being
due
for
loyalty
and
here
she
quoted
an
ancient
saying
the
king
and
his
staff
be
a
man
and
a
half
which
according
to
her
judgment
ruled
beyond
dispute
the
law
of
the
present
question
to
argue
with
her
after
that
which
she
brought
up
with
such
triumph
would
have
been
worse
than
useless
therefore
i
just
told
annie
to
make
the
bills
at
a
third
below
the
current
market
prices
so
that
the
upshot
would
be
fair
she
promised
me
honestly
that
she
would
but
with
a
twinkle
in
her
bright
blue
eyes
which
she
must
have
caught
from
tom
faggus
it
always
has
appeared
to
me
that
stern
and
downright
honesty
upon
money
matters
is
a
thing
not
understood
of
women
be
they
as
good
as
good
can
be
the
yellows
and
the
reds
together
numbered
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
most
of
whom
slept
in
our
barns
and
stacks
and
besides
these
we
had
fifteen
troopers
of
the
regular
army
you
may
suppose
that
all
the
country
was
turned
upside
down
about
it
and
the
folk
who
came
to
see
them
drillby
no
means
a
needless
exercisewere
a
greater
plague
than
the
soldiers
the
officers
too
of
the
devonshire
hand
were
such
a
torment
to
us
that
we
almost
wished
their
men
had
dismissed
them
as
the
somerset
troop
had
done
with
theirs
for
we
could
not
keep
them
out
of
our
house
being
all
young
men
of
good
family
and
therefore
not
to
be
met
with
bars
and
having
now
three
lovely
maidens
for
even
lizzie
might
be
called
so
when
she
cared
to
please
mother
and
i
were
at
wits
ends
on
account
of
those
blessed
officers
i
never
got
a
wink
of
sleep
they
came
whistling
under
the
window
so
and
directly
i
went
out
to
chase
them
there
was
nothing
but
a
cat
to
see
therefore
all
of
us
were
right
glad
except
perhaps
farmer
snowe
from
whom
we
had
bought
some
victuals
at
rare
price
when
jeremy
stickles
gave
orders
to
march
and
we
began
to
try
to
do
it
a
good
deal
of
boasting
went
overhead
as
our
men
defiled
along
the
lane
and
the
thick
broad
patins
of
pennywort
jutted
out
between
the
stones
ready
to
heal
their
bruises
the
parish
choir
came
part
of
the
way
and
the
singingloft
from
countisbury
and
they
kept
our
soldiers
spirits
up
with
some
of
the
most
pugnacious
psalms
parson
bowden
marched
ahead
leading
all
our
van
and
file
as
against
the
papists
and
promising
to
go
with
us
till
we
came
to
bullet
distance
therefore
we
marched
bravely
on
and
children
came
to
look
at
us
and
i
wondered
where
uncle
reuben
was
who
ought
to
have
led
the
culverins
whereof
we
had
no
less
than
three
if
stickles
could
only
have
found
him
and
then
i
thought
of
little
ruth
and
without
any
fault
on
my
part
my
heart
went
down
within
me
the
culverins
were
laid
on
bark
and
all
our
horses
pulling
them
and
looking
round
every
now
and
then
with
their
ears
curved
up
like
a
squirreld
nut
and
their
noses
tossing
anxiously
to
know
what
sort
of
plough
it
was
man
had
been
pleased
to
put
behind
themman
whose
endless
whims
and
wildness
they
could
never
understand
any
more
than
they
could
satisfy
however
they
pulled
their
very
bestas
all
our
horses
always
doand
the
culverins
went
up
the
hill
without
smack
of
whip
or
swearing
it
had
been
arranged
very
justly
no
doubt
and
quite
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
but
as
it
proved
not
too
wisely
that
either
body
of
men
should
act
in
its
own
county
only
so
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
the
sons
of
devon
marched
on
and
across
the
track
leading
into
doonegate
so
as
to
fetch
round
the
western
side
and
attack
with
their
culverin
from
the
cliffs
whence
the
sentry
had
challenged
me
on
the
night
of
my
passing
the
entrance
meanwhile
the
yellow
lads
were
to
stay
upon
the
eastern
highland
whence
uncle
reuben
and
myself
had
reconnoitred
so
long
ago
and
whence
i
had
leaped
into
the
valley
at
the
time
of
the
great
snowdrifts
and
here
they
were
not
to
show
themselves
but
keep
their
culverin
in
the
woods
until
their
cousins
of
devon
appeared
on
the
opposite
parapet
of
the
glen
the
third
culverin
was
entrusted
to
the
fifteen
troopers
who
with
ten
picked
soldiers
from
either
trained
hand
making
in
all
fiveandthirty
men
were
to
assault
the
doonegate
itself
while
the
outlaws
were
placed
between
two
fires
from
the
eastern
cliff
and
the
western
and
with
this
force
went
jeremy
stickles
and
with
it
went
myself
as
knowing
more
about
the
passage
than
any
other
stranger
did
therefore
if
i
have
put
it
clearly
as
i
strive
to
do
you
will
see
that
the
doones
must
repulse
at
once
three
simultaneous
attacks
from
an
army
numbering
in
the
whole
one
hundred
and
thirtyfive
men
not
including
the
devonshire
officers
fifty
men
on
each
side
i
mean
and
thirtyfive
at
the
head
of
the
valley
the
tactics
of
this
grand
campaign
appeared
to
me
so
clever
and
beautifully
ordered
that
i
commended
colonel
stickles
as
everybody
now
called
him
for
his
great
ability
and
mastery
of
the
art
of
war
he
admitted
that
he
deserved
high
praise
but
said
that
he
was
not
by
any
means
equally
certain
of
success
so
large
a
proportion
of
his
forces
being
only
a
raw
militia
brave
enough
no
doubt
for
anything
when
they
saw
their
way
to
it
but
knowing
little
of
gunnery
and
wholly
unused
to
be
shot
at
whereas
all
the
doones
were
practised
marksmen
being
compelled
when
lads
like
the
balearic
slingers
to
strike
down
their
meals
before
tasting
them
and
then
colonel
stickles
asked
me
whether
i
myself
could
stand
fire
he
knew
that
i
was
not
a
coward
but
this
was
a
different
question
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
shot
at
once
or
twice
before
but
nevertheless
disliked
it
as
much
as
almost
anything
upon
that
he
said
that
i
would
do
for
that
when
a
man
got
over
the
first
blush
of
diffidence
he
soon
began
to
look
upon
it
as
a
puff
of
destiny
i
wish
i
could
only
tell
what
happened
in
the
battle
of
that
day
especially
as
nearly
all
the
people
round
these
parts
who
never
saw
gunfire
in
it
have
gotten
the
tale
so
much
amiss
and
some
of
them
will
even
stand
in
front
of
my
own
hearth
and
contradict
me
to
the
teeth
although
at
the
time
they
were
not
born
nor
their
fathers
put
into
breeches
but
in
truth
i
cannot
tell
exactly
even
the
part
in
which
i
helped
how
then
can
i
be
expected
time
by
time
to
lay
before
you
all
the
little
ins
and
outs
of
places
where
i
myself
was
not
only
i
can
contradict
things
which
i
know
could
not
have
been
and
what
i
plainly
saw
should
not
be
controverted
in
my
own
house
now
we
fiveandthirty
men
lay
back
a
little
way
round
the
corner
in
the
hollow
of
the
track
which
leads
to
the
strong
doonegate
our
culverin
was
in
amongst
us
loaded
now
to
the
muzzle
and
it
was
not
comfortable
to
know
that
it
might
go
off
at
any
time
although
the
yeomanry
were
not
come
according
to
arrangement
some
of
us
had
horses
there
besides
the
horses
who
dragged
the
cannon
and
now
were
sniffing
at
it
and
there
were
plenty
of
spectators
to
mind
these
horses
for
us
as
soon
as
we
should
charge
inasmuch
as
all
our
friends
and
neighbours
who
had
so
keenly
prepared
for
the
battle
now
resolved
to
take
no
part
but
look
on
and
praise
the
winners
at
last
we
heard
the
loud
bangbang
which
proved
that
devon
and
somerset
were
pouring
their
indignation
hot
into
the
den
of
malefactors
or
at
least
so
we
supposed
therefore
at
double
quick
march
we
advanced
round
the
bend
of
the
cliff
which
had
hidden
us
hoping
to
find
the
gate
undefended
and
to
blow
down
all
barriers
with
the
fire
of
our
cannon
and
indeed
it
seemed
likely
at
first
to
be
so
for
the
wild
and
mountainous
gorge
of
rock
appeared
to
be
all
in
pure
loneliness
except
where
the
coloured
coats
of
our
soldiers
and
their
metal
trappings
shone
with
the
sun
behind
them
therefore
we
shouted
a
loud
hurrah
as
for
an
easy
victory
but
while
the
sound
of
our
cheer
rang
back
among
the
crags
above
us
a
shrill
clear
whistle
cleft
the
air
for
a
single
moment
and
then
a
dozen
carbines
bellowed
and
all
among
us
flew
murderous
lead
several
of
our
men
rolled
over
but
the
rest
rushed
on
like
britons
jeremy
and
myself
in
front
while
we
heard
the
horses
plunging
at
the
loaded
gun
behind
us
now
my
lads
cried
jeremy
one
dash
and
we
are
beyond
them
for
he
saw
that
the
foe
was
overhead
in
the
gallery
of
brushwood
our
men
with
a
brave
shout
answered
him
for
his
courage
was
fine
example
and
we
leaped
in
under
the
feet
of
the
foe
before
they
could
load
their
guns
again
but
here
when
the
foremost
among
us
were
past
an
awful
crash
rang
behind
us
with
the
shrieks
of
men
and
the
din
of
metal
and
the
horrible
screaming
of
horses
the
trunk
of
the
tree
had
been
launched
overhead
and
crashed
into
the
very
midst
of
us
our
cannon
was
under
it
so
were
two
men
and
a
horse
with
his
poor
back
broken
another
horse
vainly
struggled
to
rise
with
his
thighbone
smashed
and
protruding
now
i
lost
all
presence
of
mind
at
this
for
i
loved
both
those
good
horses
and
shouting
for
any
to
follow
me
dashed
headlong
into
the
cavern
some
five
or
six
men
came
after
me
the
foremost
of
whom
was
jeremy
when
a
storm
of
shot
whistled
and
patted
around
me
with
a
blaze
of
light
and
a
thunderous
roar
on
i
leaped
like
a
madman
and
pounced
on
one
gunner
and
hurled
him
across
his
culverin
but
the
others
had
fled
and
a
heavy
oak
door
fell
to
with
a
bang
behind
them
so
utterly
were
my
senses
gone
and
naught
but
strength
remaining
that
i
caught
up
the
cannon
with
both
hands
and
dashed
it
breechfirst
at
the
doorway
the
solid
oak
burst
with
the
blow
and
the
gun
stuck
fast
like
a
builders
putlog
but
here
i
looked
round
in
vain
for
any
one
to
come
and
follow
up
my
success
the
scanty
light
showed
me
no
figure
moving
through
the
length
of
the
tunnel
behind
me
only
a
heavy
groan
or
two
went
to
my
heart
and
chilled
it
so
i
hurried
back
to
seek
jeremy
fearing
that
he
must
be
smitten
down
and
so
indeed
i
found
him
as
well
as
three
other
poor
fellows
struck
by
the
charge
of
the
culverin
which
had
passed
so
close
beside
me
two
of
the
four
were
as
dead
as
stones
and
growing
cold
already
but
jeremy
and
the
other
could
manage
to
groan
just
now
and
then
so
i
turned
my
attention
to
them
and
thought
no
more
of
fighting
having
so
many
wounded
men
and
so
many
dead
among
us
we
loitered
at
the
caverns
mouth
and
looked
at
one
another
wishing
only
for
somebody
to
come
and
take
command
of
us
but
no
one
came
and
i
was
griefed
so
much
about
poor
jeremy
besides
being
wholly
unused
to
any
violence
of
bloodshed
that
i
could
only
keep
his
head
up
and
try
to
stop
him
from
bleeding
and
he
looked
up
at
me
pitifully
being
perhaps
in
a
haze
of
thought
as
a
calf
looks
at
a
butcher
the
shot
had
taken
him
in
the
mouth
about
that
no
doubt
could
be
for
two
of
his
teeth
were
in
his
beard
and
one
of
his
lips
was
wanting
i
laid
his
shattered
face
on
my
breast
and
nursed
him
as
a
woman
might
but
he
looked
at
me
with
a
jerk
at
this
and
i
saw
that
he
wanted
coolness
while
here
we
stayed
quite
out
of
danger
for
the
fellows
from
the
gallery
could
by
no
means
shoot
us
even
if
they
remained
there
and
the
oaken
door
whence
the
others
fled
was
blocked
up
by
the
culverin
a
boy
who
had
no
business
there
being
in
fact
our
clerks
apprentice
to
the
art
of
shoemaking
came
round
the
corner
upon
us
in
the
manner
which
boys
and
only
boys
can
use
with
grace
and
freedom
that
is
to
say
with
a
sudden
rush
and
a
sidelong
step
and
an
impudence
got
the
worst
of
it
cried
the
boy
better
be
off
all
of
you
zoomerzett
and

vighting
and
the
doones

ridd
even

we
few
who
yet
remained
of
the
force
which
was
to
have
won
the
doonegate
gazed
at
one
another
like
so
many
fools
and
nothing
more
for
we
still
had
some
faint
hopes
of
winning
the
day
and
recovering
our
reputation
by
means
of
what
the
other
men
might
have
done
without
us
and
we
could
not
understand
at
all
how
devonshire
and
somerset
being
embarked
in
the
same
cause
should
be
fighting
with
one
another
finding
nothing
more
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
carrying
on
the
war
we
laid
poor
master
stickles
and
two
more
of
the
wounded
upon
the
carriage
of
bark
and
hurdles
whereon
our
gun
had
lain
and
we
rolled
the
gun
into
the
river
and
harnessed
the
horses
yet
alive
and
put
the
others
out
of
their
pain
and
sadly
wended
homewards
feeling
ourselves
to
be
thoroughly
beaten
yet
ready
to
maintain
that
it
was
no
fault
of
ours
whatever
and
in
this
opinion
the
women
joined
being
only
too
glad
and
thankful
to
see
us
home
alive
again
now
this
enterprise
having
failed
so
i
prefer
not
to
dwell
too
long
upon
it
only
just
to
show
the
mischief
which
lay
at
the
root
of
the
failure
and
this
mischief
was
the
vile
jealousy
betwixt
red
and
yellow
uniform
now
i
try
to
speak
impartially
belonging
no
more
to
somerset
than
i
do
to
devonshire
living
upon
the
borders
and
born
of
either
county
the
tale
was
told
me
by
one
side
first
and
then
quite
to
a
different
tune
by
the
other
and
then
by
both
together
with
very
hot
words
of
reviling
and
a
desire
to
fight
it
out
again
and
putting
this
with
that
the
truth
appears
to
be
as
follows
the
men
of
devon
who
bore
red
facings
had
a
long
way
to
go
round
the
hills
before
they
could
get
into
due
position
on
the
western
side
of
the
doone
glen
and
knowing
that
their
cousins
in
yellow
would
claim
the
whole
of
the
glory
if
allowed
to
be
first
with
the
firing
these
worthy
fellows
waited
not
to
take
good
aim
with
their
cannons
seeing
the
others
about
to
shoot
but
fettled
it
anyhow
on
the
slope
pointing
in
a
general
direction
and
trusting
in
god
for
aimworthiness
laid
the
rope
to
the
breech
and
fired
now
as
providence
ordained
it
the
shot
which
was
a
casual
mixture
of
anything
considered
hardfor
instance
jugbottoms
and
knobs
of
doorsthe
whole
of
this
pernicious
dose
came
scattering
and
shattering
among
the
unfortunate
yellow
men
upon
the
opposite
cliff
killing
one
and
wounding
two
now
what
did
the
men
of
somerset
do
but
instead
of
waiting
for
their
friends
to
send
round
and
beg
pardon
train
their
gun
full
mouth
upon
them
and
with
a
vicious
meaning
shoot
not
only
this
but
they
loudly
cheered
when
they
saw
four
or
five
red
coats
lie
low
for
which
savage
feeling
not
even
the
remarks
of
the
devonshire
men
concerning
their
coats
could
entirely
excuse
them
now
i
need
not
tell
the
rest
of
it
for
the
tale
makes
a
man
discontented
enough
that
both
sides
waxed
hotter
and
hotter
with
the
fire
of
destruction
and
but
that
the
gorge
of
the
cliffs
lay
between
very
few
would
have
lived
to
tell
of
it
for
our
western
blood
becomes
stiff
and
firm
when
churned
with
the
sense
of
wrong
in
it
at
last
the
doones
who
must
have
laughed
at
the
thunder
passing
overhead
recalling
their
men
from
the
gallery
issued
out
of
gwennys
gate
which
had
been
wholly
overlooked
and
fell
on
the
rear
of
the
somerset
men
and
slew
four
beside
their
cannon
then
while
the
survivors
ran
away
the
outlaws
took
the
hot
culverin
and
rolled
it
down
into
their
valley
thus
of
the
three
guns
set
forth
that
morning
only
one
ever
came
home
again
and
that
was
the
gun
of
the
devonshire
men
who
dragged
it
home
themselves
with
the
view
of
making
a
boast
about
it
this
was
a
melancholy
end
of
our
brave
setting
out
and
everybody
blamed
every
one
else
and
several
of
us
wanted
to
have
the
whole
thing
over
again
as
then
we
must
have
righted
it
but
upon
one
point
all
agreed
by
some
reason
not
clear
to
me
that
the
root
of
the
evil
was
to
be
found
in
the
way
parson
bowden
went
up
the
hill
with
his
hat
on
and
no
cassock
chapter
lv
getting
into
chancery
two
of
the
devonshire
officers
captains
pyke
and
dallan
now
took
command
of
the
men
who
were
left
and
ordered
all
to
go
home
again
commending
much
the
bravery
which
had
been
displayed
on
all
sides
and
the
loyalty
to
the
king
and
the
english
constitution
this
last
word
always
seems
to
me
to
settle
everything
when
said
because
nobody
understands
it
and
yet
all
can
puzzle
their
neighbours
so
the
devonshire
men
having
beans
to
sow
which
they
ought
to
have
done
on
good
friday
went
home
and
our
somerset
friends
only
stayed
for
two
days
more
to
backbite
them
to
me
the
whole
thing
was
purely
grievous
not
from
any
sense
of
defeat
though
that
was
bad
enough
but
from
the
pain
and
anguish
caused
by
death
and
wounds
and
mourning
surely
we
have
woes
enough
i
used
to
think
of
an
evening
when
the
poor
fellows
could
not
sleep
or
rest
or
let
others
rest
around
them
surely
all
this
smell
of
wounds
is
not
incense
men
should
pay
to
the
god
who
made
them
death
when
it
comes
and
is
done
with
may
be
a
bliss
to
any
one
but
the
doubt
of
life
or
death
when
a
man
lies
as
it
were
like
a
trunk
upon
a
sawpit
and
a
grisly
head
looks
up
at
him
and
the
groans
of
pain
are
cleaving
him
this
would
be
beyond
all
bearingbut
for
natures
sapsweet
hope
jeremy
stickles
lay
and
tossed
and
thrust
up
his
feet
in
agony
and
bit
with
his
lipless
mouth
the
clothes
and
was
proud
to
see
blood
upon
them
he
looked
at
us
ever
so
many
times
as
much
as
to
say
fools
let
me
die
then
i
shall
have
some
comfort
but
we
nodded
at
him
sagely
especially
the
women
trying
to
convey
to
him
on
no
account
to
die
yet
and
then
we
talked
to
one
another
on
purpose
for
him
to
hear
us
how
brave
he
was
and
not
the
man
to
knock
under
in
a
hurry
and
how
he
should
have
the
victory
yet
and
how
well
he
looked
considering
these
things
cheered
him
a
little
now
and
a
little
more
next
time
and
every
time
we
went
on
so
he
took
it
with
less
impatience
then
once
when
he
had
been
very
quiet
and
not
even
tried
to
frown
at
us
annie
leaned
over
and
kissed
his
forehead
and
spread
the
pillows
and
sheet
with
a
curve
as
delicate
as
his
own
white
ears
and
then
he
feebly
lifted
hands
and
prayed
to
god
to
bless
her
and
after
that
he
came
round
gently
though
never
to
the
man
he
had
been
and
never
to
speak
loud
again
for
a
time
as
i
may
have
implied
before
master
stickless
authority
and
manner
of
levying
duties
had
not
been
taken
kindly
by
the
people
round
our
neighbourhood
the
manors
of
east
lynn
and
west
lynn
and
even
that
of
woolhangeralthough
just
then
all
three
were
at
issue
about
some
rights
of
wreck
and
the
hanging
of
a
sheepstealer
a
man
of
no
great
eminence
yet
claimed
by
each
for
the
sake
of
his
clothesthese
three
having
their
rights
impugned
or
even
superseded
as
they
declared
by
the
quartering
of
soldiers
in
their
neighbourhood
united
very
kindly
to
oppose
the
kings
commissioner
however
jeremy
had
contrived
to
conciliate
the
whole
of
them
not
so
much
by
anything
engaging
in
his
deportment
or
delicate
address
as
by
holding
out
bright
hopes
that
the
plunder
of
the
doone
glen
might
become
divisible
among
the
adjoining
manors
now
i
have
never
discovered
a
thing
which
the
lords
of
manors
at
least
in
our
part
of
the
world
do
not
believe
to
belong
to
themselves
if
only
they
could
get
their
rights
and
it
did
seem
natural
enough
that
if
the
doones
were
ousted
and
a
nice
collection
of
prey
remained
this
should
be
parted
among
the
people
having
ancient
rights
of
plunder
nevertheless
master
jeremy
knew
that
the
soldiers
would
have
the
first
of
it
and
the
king
what
they
could
not
carry
and
perhaps
he
was
punished
justly
for
language
so
misleading
by
the
general
indignation
of
the
people
all
around
us
not
at
his
failure
but
at
himself
for
that
which
he
could
in
no
wise
prevent
and
the
stewards
of
the
manors
rode
up
to
our
house
on
purpose
to
reproach
him
and
were
greatly
vexed
with
all
of
us
because
he
was
too
ill
to
see
them
to
myself
though
by
rights
the
last
to
be
thought
of
among
so
much
pain
and
trouble
jeremys
wound
was
a
great
misfortune
in
more
ways
than
one
in
the
first
place
it
deferred
my
chance
of
imparting
either
to
my
mother
or
to
mistress
lorna
my
firm
belief
that
the
maid
i
loved
was
not
sprung
from
the
race
which
had
slain
my
father
neither
could
he
in
any
way
have
offended
against
her
family
and
this
discovery
i
was
yearning
more
and
more
to
declare
to
them
being
forced
to
see
even
in
the
midst
of
all
our
warlike
troubles
that
a
certain
difference
was
growing
betwixt
them
both
and
betwixt
them
and
me
for
although
the
words
of
the
counsellor
had
seemed
to
fail
among
us
being
bravely
met
and
scattered
yet
our
courage
was
but
as
wind
flinging
wide
the
tareseeds
when
the
sower
casts
them
from
his
bag
the
crop
may
not
come
evenly
many
places
may
long
lie
bare
and
the
field
be
all
in
patches
yet
almost
every
vetch
will
spring
and
tiller
out
and
stretch
across
the
scatterings
where
the
wind
puffed
and
so
dear
mother
and
darling
lorna
now
had
been
for
many
a
day
thinking
worrying
and
wearing
about
the
matter
between
us
neither
liked
to
look
at
the
other
as
they
used
to
do
with
mother
admiring
lornas
eyes
and
grace
and
form
of
breeding
and
lorna
loving
mothers
goodness
softness
and
simplicity
and
the
saddest
and
most
hurtful
thing
was
that
neither
could
ask
the
other
of
the
shadow
falling
between
them
and
so
it
went
on
and
deepened
in
the
next
place
colonel
stickless
illness
was
a
grievous
thing
to
us
in
that
we
had
no
one
now
to
command
the
troopers
ten
of
these
were
still
alive
and
so
well
approved
to
us
that
they
could
never
fancy
aught
whether
for
dinner
or
supper
without
its
being
forthcoming
if
they
wanted
trout
they
should
have
it
if
colloped
venison
or
broiled
ham
or
salmon
from
lynmouth
and
trentisoe
or
truffles
from
the
woodside
all
these
were
at
the
warriors
service
until
they
lusted
for
something
else
even
the
wounded
men
ate
nobly
all
except
poor
jeremy
who
was
forced
to
have
a
young
elder
shoot
with
the
pith
drawn
for
to
feed
him
and
once
when
they
wanted
pickled
loach
from
my
description
of
it
i
took
up
my
boyish
sport
again
and
pronged
them
a
good
jarful
therefore
none
of
them
could
complain
and
yet
they
were
not
satisfied
perhaps
for
want
of
complaining
be
that
as
it
might
we
knew
that
if
they
once
resolved
to
go
as
they
might
do
at
any
time
with
only
a
corporal
over
them
all
our
house
and
all
our
goods
ay
and
our
own
precious
lives
would
and
must
be
at
the
mercy
of
embittered
enemies
for
now
the
doones
having
driven
back
as
every
one
said
five
hundred
menthough
not
thirty
had
ever
fought
with
themwere
in
such
feather
all
round
the
country
that
nothing
was
too
good
for
them
offerings
poured
in
at
the
doone
gate
faster
than
doones
could
away
with
them
and
the
sympathy
both
of
devon
and
somerset
became
almost
oppressive
and
perhaps
this
wealth
of
congratulation
and
mutual
good
feeling
between
plundered
and
victim
saved
us
from
any
piece
of
spite
kindliness
having
won
the
day
and
every
one
loving
every
one
but
yet
another
cause
arose
and
this
the
strongest
one
of
all
to
prove
the
need
of
stickless
aid
and
calamity
of
his
illness
and
this
came
to
our
knowledge
first
without
much
time
to
think
of
it
for
two
men
appeared
at
our
gate
one
day
stripped
to
their
shirts
and
void
of
horses
and
looking
very
sorrowful
now
having
some
fear
of
attack
from
the
doones
and
scarce
knowing
what
their
tricks
might
be
we
received
these
strangers
cautiously
desiring
to
know
who
they
were
before
we
let
them
see
all
our
premises
however
it
soon
became
plain
to
us
that
although
they
might
not
be
honest
fellows
at
any
rate
they
were
not
doones
and
so
we
took
them
in
and
fed
and
left
them
to
tell
their
business
and
this
they
were
glad
enough
to
do
as
men
who
have
been
maltreated
almost
always
are
and
it
was
not
for
us
to
contradict
them
lest
our
victuals
should
go
amiss
these
two
very
worthy
fellowsnay
more
than
that
by
their
own
account
being
downright
martyrswere
come
for
the
public
benefit
from
the
court
of
chancery
sitting
for
everybodys
good
and
boldly
redressing
evil
this
court
has
a
power
of
scent
unknown
to
the
commonlaw
practitioners
and
slowly
yet
surely
tracks
its
game
even
as
the
great
lumbering
dogs
now
introduced
from
spain
and
called
by
some
people
pointers
differ
from
the
swift
gazehound
who
sees
his
prey
and
runs
him
down
in
the
manner
of
the
common
lawyers
if
a
mans
ill
fate
should
drive
him
to
make
a
choice
between
these
two
let
him
rather
be
chased
by
the
hounds
of
law
than
tracked
by
the
dogs
of
equity
now
as
it
fell
in
a
very
black
day
for
all
except
the
lawyers
his
majestys
court
of
chancery
if
that
be
what
it
called
itself
gained
scent
of
poor
lornas
life
and
of
all
that
might
be
made
of
it
whether
through
that
brave
young
lord
who
ran
into
such
peril
or
through
any
of
his
friends
or
whether
through
that
deep
old
counsellor
whose
game
none
might
penetrate
or
through
any
disclosures
of
the
italian
woman
or
even
of
jeremy
himself
none
just
now
could
tell
us
only
this
truth
was
too
clearchancery
had
heard
of
lorna
and
then
had
seen
how
rich
she
was
and
never
delaying
in
one
thing
had
opened
mouth
and
swallowed
her
the
doones
with
a
share
of
that
dry
humour
which
was
in
them
hereditary
had
welcomed
the
two
apparitors
if
that
be
the
proper
name
for
them
and
led
them
kindly
down
the
valley
and
told
them
then
to
serve
their
writ
misliking
the
look
of
things
these
poor
men
began
to
fumble
among
their
clothes
upon
which
the
doones
cried
off
with
them
let
us
see
if
your
message
he
on
your
skins
and
with
no
more
manners
than
that
they
stripped
and
lashed
them
out
of
the
valley
only
bidding
them
come
to
us
if
they
wanted
lorna
doone
and
to
us
they
came
accordingly
neither
were
they
sure
at
first
but
that
we
should
treat
them
so
for
they
had
no
knowledge
of
the
west
country
and
thought
it
quite
a
godless
place
wherein
no
writ
was
holy
we
however
comforted
and
cheered
them
so
considerably
that
in
gratitude
they
showed
their
writs
to
which
they
had
stuck
like
leeches
and
these
were
twofold
one
addressed
to
mistress
lorna
doone
so
called
and
bidding
her
keep
in
readiness
to
travel
whenever
called
upon
and
commit
herself
to
nobody
except
the
accredited
messengers
of
the
right
honourable
court
while
the
other
was
addressed
to
all
subjects
of
his
majesty
having
custody
of
lorna
doone
or
any
power
over
her
and
this
last
threatened
and
exhorted
and
held
out
hopes
of
recompense
if
she
were
rendered
truly
my
mother
and
i
held
consultation
over
both
these
documents
with
a
mixture
of
some
wrath
and
fear
and
a
fork
of
great
sorrow
to
stir
them
and
now
having
jeremy
stickless
leave
which
he
gave
with
a
nod
when
i
told
him
all
and
at
last
made
him
understand
it
i
laid
bare
to
my
mother
as
well
what
i
knew
as
what
i
merely
surmised
or
guessed
concerning
lornas
parentage
all
this
she
received
with
great
tears
and
wonder
and
fervent
thanks
to
god
and
still
more
fervent
praise
of
her
son
who
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
however
now
the
question
was
how
to
act
about
these
writs
and
herein
it
was
most
unlucky
that
we
could
not
have
master
stickles
with
his
knowledge
of
the
world
and
especially
of
the
lawcourts
to
advise
us
what
to
do
and
to
help
in
doing
it
and
firstly
of
the
first
i
said
we
have
rogues
to
deal
with
but
try
we
not
to
rogue
them
to
this
in
some
measure
dear
mother
agreed
though
she
could
not
see
the
justice
of
it
yet
thought
that
it
might
be
wiser
because
of
our
want
of
practice
and
then
i
said
now
we
are
bound
to
tell
lorna
and
to
serve
her
citation
upon
her
which
these
good
fellows
have
given
us
then
go
and
do
it
thyself
my
son
mother
replied
with
a
mournful
smile
misdoubting
what
the
end
might
be
so
i
took
the
slip
of
brown
parchment
and
went
to
seek
my
darling
lorna
was
in
her
favourite
place
the
little
garden
which
she
tended
with
such
care
and
diligence
seeing
how
the
maiden
loved
it
and
was
happy
there
i
had
laboured
hard
to
fence
it
from
the
dangers
of
the
wood
and
here
she
had
corrected
me
with
better
taste
and
sense
of
pleasure
and
the
joys
of
musing
for
i
meant
to
shut
out
the
brook
and
build
my
fence
inside
of
it
but
lorna
said
no
if
we
must
have
a
fence
which
could
not
but
be
injury
at
any
rate
leave
the
stream
inside
and
a
pleasant
bank
beyond
it
and
soon
i
perceived
that
she
was
right
though
not
so
much
as
afterwards
for
the
fairest
of
all
things
in
a
garden
and
in
summertime
most
useful
is
a
brook
of
crystal
water
where
a
man
may
come
and
meditate
and
the
flowers
may
lean
and
see
themselves
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
purfied
now
partly
with
her
own
white
hands
and
partly
with
gwennys
red
ones
lorna
had
made
of
this
sunny
spot
a
haven
of
beauty
to
dwell
in
it
was
not
only
that
colours
lay
in
the
harmony
we
would
seek
of
them
neither
was
it
the
height
of
plants
sloping
to
one
another
nor
even
the
delicate
tone
of
foliage
following
suit
and
neighbouring
even
the
breathing
of
the
wind
soft
and
gentle
in
and
out
moving
things
that
need
not
move
and
passing
longerstalked
ones
even
this
was
not
enough
among
the
flush
of
fragrance
to
tell
a
man
the
reason
of
his
quiet
satisfaction
but
so
it
shall
for
ever
be
as
the
river
we
float
upon
with
wine
and
flowers
and
music
is
nothing
at
the
wellspring
but
a
bubble
without
reason
feeling
many
things
but
thinking
without
much
to
guide
me
over
the
grassplats
laid
between
i
went
up
to
lorna
she
in
a
shower
of
damask
roses
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
me
and
even
now
in
those
sweet
eyes
so
deep
with
lovingkindness
and
soft
maiden
dreamings
there
seemed
to
be
a
slight
unwilling
half
confessed
withdrawal
overcome
by
love
and
duty
yet
a
painful
thing
to
see
darling
i
said
are
your
spirits
good
are
you
strong
enough
today
to
bear
a
tale
of
cruel
sorrow
but
which
perhaps
when
your
tears
are
shed
will
leave
you
all
the
happier
what
can
you
mean
she
answered
trembling
not
having
been
vey
strong
of
late
and
now
surprised
at
my
manner
are
you
come
to
give
me
up
john
not
very
likely
i
replied
neither
do
i
hope
such
a
thing
would
leave
you
all
the
happier
oh
lorna
if
you
can
think
that
so
quickly
as
you
seem
to
have
done
now
you
have
every
prospect
and
strong
temptation
to
it
you
are
far
far
above
me
in
the
world
and
i
have
no
right
to
claim
you
perhaps
when
you
have
heard
these
tidings
you
will
say
john
ridd
begone
your
life
and
mine
are
parted
will
i
cried
lorna
with
all
the
brightness
of
her
playful
ways
returning
you
very
foolish
and
jealous
john
how
shall
i
punish
you
for
this
am
i
to
forsake
every
flower
i
have
and
not
even
know
that
the
world
goes
round
while
i
look
up
at
you
the
whole
day
long
and
say
john
i
love
love
love
you
during
these
words
she
leaned
upon
me
half
in
gay
imitation
of
what
i
had
so
often
made
her
do
and
half
in
depth
of
earnestness
as
the
thricerepeated
word
grew
stronger
and
grew
warmer
with
and
to
her
heart
and
as
she
looked
up
at
the
finish
saying
you
so
musically
i
was
much
inclined
to
clasp
her
round
but
remembering
who
she
was
forbore
at
which
she
seemed
surprised
with
me
mistress
lorna
i
replied
with
i
know
not
what
temptation
making
little
of
her
caresses
though
more
than
all
my
heart
to
me
mistress
lorna
you
must
keep
your
rank
and
proper
dignity
you
must
never
look
at
me
with
anything
but
pity
now
i
shall
look
at
you
with
pity
john
said
lorna
trying
to
laugh
it
off
yet
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
me
if
you
talk
any
more
of
this
nonsense
knowing
me
as
you
ought
to
do
i
shall
even
begin
to
think
that
you
and
your
friends
are
weary
of
me
and
of
so
long
supporting
me
and
are
only
seeking
cause
to
send
me
back
to
my
old
misery
if
it
be
so
i
will
go
my
life
matters
little
to
any
one
here
the
great
bright
tears
arose
but
the
maiden
was
too
proud
to
sob
sweetest
of
all
sweet
loves
i
cried
for
the
sign
of
a
tear
defeated
me
what
possibility
could
make
me
ever
give
up
lorna
dearest
of
all
dears
she
answered
if
you
dearly
love
me
what
possibility
could
ever
make
me
give
you
up
dear
upon
that
there
was
no
more
forbearing
but
i
kissed
and
clasped
her
whether
she
were
countess
or
whether
queen
of
england
mine
she
was
at
least
in
heart
and
mine
she
should
be
wholly
and
she
being
of
the
same
opinion
nothing
was
said
between
us
now
lorna
said
i
as
she
hung
on
my
arm
willing
to
trust
me
anywhere
come
to
your
little
planthouse
and
hear
my
moving
story
no
story
can
move
me
much
dear
she
answered
rather
faintly
for
any
excitement
stayed
with
her
since
i
know
your
strength
of
kindness
scarcely
any
tale
can
move
me
unless
it
be
of
yourself
love
or
of
my
poor
mother
it
is
of
your
poor
mother
darling
can
you
bear
to
hear
it
and
yet
i
wondered
why
she
did
not
say
as
much
of
her
father
yes
i
can
bear
anything
but
although
i
cannot
see
her
and
have
long
forgotten
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
ill
of
her
there
is
no
ill
to
hear
sweet
child
except
of
evil
done
to
her
lorna
you
are
of
an
illstarred
race
better
that
than
a
wicked
race
she
answered
with
her
usual
quickness
leaping
at
conclusion
tell
me
i
am
not
a
doone
and
i
willbut
i
cannot
love
you
more
you
are
not
a
doone
my
lorna
for
that
at
least
i
can
answer
though
i
know
not
what
your
name
is
and
my
fatheryour
fatherwhat
i
mean
is
your
father
and
mine
never
met
one
another
your
father
was
killed
by
an
accident
in
the
pyrenean
mountains
and
your
mother
by
the
doones
or
at
least
they
caused
her
death
and
carried
you
away
from
her
all
this
coming
as
in
one
breath
upon
the
sensitive
maiden
was
more
than
she
could
bear
all
at
once
as
any
but
a
fool
like
me
must
of
course
have
known
she
lay
back
on
the
garden
bench
with
her
black
hair
shed
on
the
oaken
bark
while
her
colour
went
and
came
and
only
by
that
and
her
quivering
breath
could
any
one
say
that
she
lived
and
thought
and
yet
she
pressed
my
hand
with
hers
that
i
might
tell
her
all
of
it
chapter
lvi
john
becomes
too
popular
no
flower
that
i
have
ever
seen
either
in
shifting
of
light
and
shade
or
in
the
pearly
morning
may
vie
with
a
fair
young
womans
face
when
tender
thought
and
quick
emotion
vary
enrich
and
beautify
it
thus
my
lorna
hearkened
softly
almost
without
word
or
gesture
yet
with
sighs
and
glances
telling
and
the
pressure
of
my
hand
how
each
word
was
moving
her
when
at
last
my
tale
was
done
she
turned
away
and
wept
bitterly
for
the
sad
fate
of
her
parents
but
to
my
surprise
she
spoke
not
even
a
word
of
wrath
or
rancour
she
seemed
to
take
it
all
as
fate
lorna
darling
i
said
at
length
for
men
are
more
impatient
in
trials
of
time
than
women
are
do
you
not
even
wish
to
know
what
your
proper
name
is
how
can
it
matter
to
me
john
she
answered
with
a
depth
of
grief
which
made
me
seem
a
trifler
it
can
never
matter
now
when
there
are
none
to
share
it
poor
little
soul
was
all
i
said
in
a
tone
of
purest
pity
and
to
my
surprise
she
turned
upon
me
caught
me
in
her
arms
and
loved
me
as
she
had
never
done
before
dearest
i
have
you
she
cried
you
and
only
you
love
having
you
i
want
no
other
all
my
life
is
one
with
yours
oh
john
how
can
i
treat
you
so
blushing
through
the
wet
of
weeping
and
the
gloom
of
pondering
yet
she
would
not
hide
her
eyes
but
folded
me
and
dwelled
on
me
i
cannot
believe
in
the
pride
of
my
joy
i
whispered
into
one
little
ear
that
you
could
ever
so
love
me
beauty
as
to
give
up
the
world
for
me
would
you
give
up
your
farm
for
me
john
cried
lorna
leaping
back
and
looking
with
her
wondrous
power
of
light
at
me
would
you
give
up
your
mother
your
sisters
your
home
and
all
that
you
have
in
the
world
and
every
hope
of
your
life
john
of
course
i
would
without
two
thoughts
you
know
it
you
know
it
lorna
it
is
true
that
i
do
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
deepest
sadness
and
it
is
this
power
of
your
love
which
has
made
me
love
you
so
no
good
can
come
of
it
no
good
gods
face
is
set
against
selfishness
as
she
spoke
in
that
low
tone
i
gazed
at
the
clear
lines
of
her
face
where
every
curve
was
perfect
not
with
love
and
wonder
only
but
with
a
strange
new
sense
of
awe
darling
i
said
come
nearer
to
me
give
me
surety
against
that
for
gods
sake
never
frighten
me
with
the
thought
that
he
would
part
us
does
it
then
so
frighten
you
she
whispered
coming
close
to
me
i
know
it
dear
i
have
known
it
long
but
it
never
frightens
me
it
makes
me
sad
and
very
lonely
till
i
can
remember
till
you
can
remember
what
i
asked
with
a
long
deep
shudder
for
we
are
so
superstitious
until
i
do
remember
love
that
you
will
soon
come
back
to
me
and
be
my
own
for
ever
this
is
what
i
always
think
of
this
is
what
i
hope
for
although
her
eyes
were
so
glorious
and
beaming
with
eternity
this
distant
sort
of
beatitude
was
not
much
to
my
liking
i
wanted
to
have
my
love
on
earth
and
my
dear
wife
in
my
own
home
and
children
in
good
time
if
god
should
please
to
send
us
any
and
then
i
would
be
to
them
exactly
what
my
father
was
to
me
and
beside
all
this
i
doubted
much
about
being
fit
for
heaven
where
no
ploughs
are
and
no
cattle
unless
sacrificed
bulls
went
thither
therefore
i
said
now
kiss
me
lorna
and
dont
talk
any
nonsense
and
the
darling
came
and
did
it
being
kindly
obedient
as
the
other
world
often
makes
us
you
sweet
love
i
said
at
this
being
slave
to
her
soft
obedience
do
you
suppose
i
should
be
content
to
leave
you
until
elysium
how
on
earth
can
i
tell
dear
john
what
you
will
be
content
with
you
and
only
you
said
i
the
whole
of
it
lies
in
a
syllable
now
you
know
my
entire
want
and
want
must
be
my
comfort
but
surely
if
i
have
money
sir
and
birth
and
rank
and
all
sorts
of
grandeur
you
would
never
dare
to
think
of
me
she
drew
herself
up
with
an
air
of
pride
as
she
gravely
pronounced
these
words
and
gave
me
a
scornful
glance
or
tried
and
turned
away
as
if
to
enter
some
grand
coach
or
palace
while
i
was
so
amazed
and
grieved
in
my
raw
simplicity
especially
after
the
way
in
which
she
had
first
received
my
news
so
loving
and
warmhearted
that
i
never
said
a
word
but
stared
and
thought
how
does
she
mean
it
she
saw
the
pain
upon
my
forehead
and
the
wonder
in
my
eyes
and
leaving
coach
and
palace
too
back
she
flew
to
me
in
a
moment
as
simple
as
simplest
milkmaid
oh
you
fearful
stupid
john
you
inexpressibly
stupid
john
she
cried
with
both
arms
round
my
neck
and
her
lips
upon
my
forehead
you
have
called
yourself
thickheaded
john
and
i
never
would
believe
it
but
now
i
do
with
all
my
heart
will
you
never
know
what
i
am
love
no
lorna
that
i
never
shall
i
can
understand
my
mother
well
and
one
at
least
of
my
sisters
and
both
the
snowe
girls
very
easily
but
you
i
never
understand
only
love
you
all
the
more
for
it
then
never
try
to
understand
me
if
the
result
is
that
dear
john
and
yet
i
am
the
very
simplest
of
all
foolish
simple
creatures
nay
i
am
wrong
therein
i
yield
the
palm
to
you
my
dear
to
think
that
i
can
act
so
no
wonder
they
want
me
in
london
as
an
ornament
for
the
stage
john
now
in
after
days
when
i
heard
of
lorna
as
the
richest
and
noblest
and
loveliest
lady
to
be
found
in
london
i
often
remembered
that
little
scene
and
recalled
every
word
and
gesture
wondering
what
lay
under
it
even
now
while
it
was
quite
impossible
once
to
doubt
those
clear
deep
eyes
and
the
bright
lips
trembling
so
nevertheless
i
felt
how
much
the
world
would
have
to
do
with
it
and
that
the
best
and
truest
people
cannot
shake
themselves
quite
free
however
for
the
moment
i
was
very
proud
and
showed
it
and
herein
differs
fact
from
fancy
things
as
they
befall
us
from
things
as
we
would
have
them
human
ends
from
human
hopes
that
the
first
are
moved
by
a
thousand
and
the
last
on
two
wheels
only
which
being
named
are
desire
and
fear
hope
of
course
is
nothing
more
than
desire
with
a
telescope
magnifying
distant
matters
overlooking
near
ones
opening
one
eye
on
the
objects
closing
the
other
to
all
objections
and
if
hope
be
the
future
tense
of
desire
the
future
of
fear
is
religionat
least
with
too
many
of
us
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
in
these
small
moralities
one
thing
is
sure
enough
to
wit
that
hope
is
the
fastest
traveller
at
any
rate
in
the
time
of
youth
and
so
i
hoped
that
lorna
might
be
proved
of
blameless
family
and
honourable
rank
and
fortune
and
yet
none
the
less
for
that
love
me
and
belong
to
me
so
i
led
her
into
the
house
and
she
fell
into
my
mothers
arms
and
i
left
them
to
have
a
good
cry
of
it
with
annie
ready
to
help
them
if
master
stickles
should
not
mend
enough
to
gain
his
speech
a
little
and
declare
to
us
all
he
knew
i
was
to
set
out
for
watchett
riding
upon
horseback
and
there
to
hire
a
cart
with
wheels
such
as
we
had
not
begun
as
yet
to
use
on
exmoor
for
all
our
work
went
on
broad
wood
with
runners
and
with
earthboards
and
many
of
us
still
looked
upon
wheels
though
mentioned
in
the
bible
as
the
invention
of
the
evil
one
and
pharoahs
especial
property
now
instead
of
getting
better
colonel
stickles
grew
worse
and
worse
in
spite
of
all
our
tendance
of
him
with
simples
and
with
nourishment
and
no
poisonous
medicine
such
as
doctors
would
have
given
him
and
the
fault
of
this
lay
not
with
us
but
purely
with
himself
and
his
unquiet
constitution
for
he
roused
himself
up
to
a
perfect
fever
when
through
lizzies
giddiness
he
learned
the
very
thing
which
mother
and
annie
were
hiding
from
him
with
the
utmost
care
namely
that
sergeant
bloxham
had
taken
upon
himself
to
send
direct
to
london
by
the
chancery
officers
a
full
report
of
what
had
happened
and
of
the
illness
of
his
chief
together
with
an
urgent
prayer
for
a
full
battalion
of
kings
troops
and
a
plenary
commander
this
sergeant
bloxham
being
senior
of
the
surviving
soldiers
and
a
very
worthy
man
in
his
way
but
a
trifle
overzealous
had
succeeded
to
the
captaincy
upon
his
masters
disablement
then
with
desire
to
serve
his
country
and
show
his
education
he
sat
up
most
part
of
three
nights
and
wrote
this
very
wonderful
report
by
the
aid
of
our
stable
lanthorn
it
was
a
very
fine
piece
of
work
as
three
men
to
whom
he
read
it
but
only
one
at
a
time
pronounced
being
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
all
might
have
gone
well
with
it
if
the
author
could
only
have
held
his
tongue
when
near
the
ears
of
women
but
this
was
beyond
his
sense
as
it
seems
although
so
good
a
writer
for
having
heard
that
our
lizzie
was
a
famous
judge
of
literature
as
indeed
she
told
almost
every
one
he
could
not
contain
himself
but
must
have
her
opinion
upon
his
work
lizzie
sat
on
a
log
of
wood
and
listened
with
all
her
ears
up
having
made
proviso
that
no
one
else
should
be
there
to
interrupt
her
and
she
put
in
a
syllable
here
and
there
and
many
a
time
she
took
out
one
for
the
sergeant
overloaded
his
gun
more
often
than
undercharged
it
like
a
liberal
man
of
letters
and
then
she
declared
the
result
so
good
so
chaste
and
the
style
to
be
so
elegant
and
yet
so
fervent
that
the
sergeant
broke
his
pipe
in
three
and
fell
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
now
this
has
led
me
out
of
my
way
as
things
are
always
doing
partly
through
their
own
perverseness
partly
through
my
kind
desire
to
give
fair
turn
to
all
of
them
and
to
all
the
people
who
do
them
if
any
one
expects
of
me
a
strict
and
welldrilled
story
standing
at
attention
all
the
time
with
hands
at
the
side
like
two
wens
on
my
trunk
and
eyes
going
neither
right
nor
left
i
trow
that
man
has
been
disappointed
many
a
page
ago
and
has
left
me
to
my
evil
ways
and
if
not
i
love
his
charity
therefore
let
me
seek
his
grace
and
get
back
and
just
begin
again
that
great
despatch
was
sent
to
london
by
the
chancery
officers
whom
we
fitted
up
with
clothes
and
for
three
days
fattened
them
which
in
strict
justice
they
needed
much
as
well
as
in
point
of
equity
they
were
kind
enough
to
be
pleased
with
us
and
accepted
my
new
shirts
generously
and
urgent
as
their
business
was
another
week
as
they
both
declared
could
do
no
harm
to
nobody
and
might
set
them
upon
their
legs
again
and
knowing
although
they
were
london
men
that
fish
do
live
in
water
these
two
fellows
went
fishing
all
day
but
never
landed
anything
however
their
holiday
was
cut
short
for
the
sergeant
having
finished
now
his
narrative
of
proceedings
was
not
the
man
to
let
it
hang
fire
and
be
quenched
perhaps
by
stickles
therefore
having
done
their
business
and
served
both
citations
these
two
good
men
had
a
pannier
of
victuals
put
up
by
dear
annie
and
borrowing
two
of
our
horses
rode
to
dunster
where
they
left
them
and
hired
on
towards
london
we
had
not
time
to
like
them
much
and
so
we
did
not
miss
them
especially
in
our
great
anxiety
about
poor
master
stickles
jeremy
lay
between
life
and
death
for
at
least
a
fortnight
if
the
link
of
chain
had
flown
upwards
for
half
a
link
of
chain
it
was
which
took
him
in
the
mouth
so
even
one
inch
upwards
the
poor
man
could
have
needed
no
one
except
parson
bowden
for
the
bottom
of
his
skull
which
holds
the
brain
as
in
the
eggcup
must
have
clean
gone
from
him
but
striking
him
horizontally
and
a
little
upon
the
skew
the
metal
came
out
at
the
back
of
his
neck
and
the
powder
not
being
strong
i
suppose
it
lodged
in
his
leather
collar
now
the
rust
of
this
iron
hung
in
the
wound
or
at
least
we
thought
so
though
since
i
have
talked
with
a
man
of
medicine
i
am
not
so
sure
of
it
and
our
chief
aim
was
to
purge
this
rust
when
rather
we
should
have
stopped
the
hole
and
let
the
oxide
do
its
worst
with
a
plug
of
new
flesh
on
both
sides
of
it
at
last
i
prevailed
upon
him
by
argument
that
he
must
get
better
to
save
himself
from
being
ignobly
and
unjustly
superseded
and
hereupon
i
reviled
sergeant
bloxham
more
fiercely
than
jeremys
self
could
have
done
and
indeed
to
such
a
pitch
that
jeremy
almost
forgave
him
and
became
much
milder
and
after
that
his
fever
and
the
inflammation
of
his
wound
diminished
very
rapidly
however
not
knowing
what
might
happen
or
even
how
soon
poor
lorna
might
be
taken
from
our
power
and
falling
into
lawyers
hands
have
cause
to
wish
herself
most
heartily
back
among
the
robbers
i
set
forth
one
day
for
watchett
taking
advantage
of
the
visit
of
some
troopers
from
an
outpost
who
would
make
our
house
quite
safe
i
rode
alone
being
fully
primed
and
having
no
misgivings
for
it
was
said
that
even
the
doones
had
begun
to
fear
me
since
i
cast
their
culverin
through
the
door
as
above
related
and
they
could
not
but
believe
from
my
being
still
untouched
although
so
large
an
object
in
the
thickest
of
their
fire
both
of
gun
and
cannon
that
i
must
bear
a
charmed
life
proof
against
ball
and
bullet
however
i
knew
that
carver
doone
was
not
a
likely
man
to
hold
any
superstitious
opinions
and
of
him
i
had
an
instinctive
dread
although
quite
ready
to
face
him
riding
along
i
meditated
upon
lornas
history
how
many
things
were
now
beginning
to
unfold
themselves
which
had
been
obscure
and
dark
for
instance
sir
ensor
doones
consent
or
to
say
the
least
his
indifference
to
her
marriage
with
a
yeoman
which
in
a
man
so
proud
though
dying
had
greatly
puzzled
both
of
us
but
now
if
she
not
only
proved
to
be
no
grandchild
of
the
doone
but
even
descended
from
his
enemy
it
was
natural
enough
that
he
should
feel
no
great
repugnance
to
her
humiliation
and
that
lornas
father
had
been
a
foe
to
the
house
of
doone
i
gathered
from
her
mothers
cry
when
she
beheld
their
leader
moreover
that
fact
would
supply
their
motive
in
carrying
off
the
unfortunate
little
creature
and
rearing
her
among
them
and
as
one
of
their
own
family
yet
hiding
her
true
birth
from
her
she
was
a
great
card
as
we
say
when
playing
allfours
at
christmastime
and
if
one
of
them
could
marry
her
before
she
learned
of
right
and
wrong
vast
property
enough
to
buy
pardons
for
a
thousand
doones
would
be
at
their
mercy
and
since
i
was
come
to
know
lorna
better
and
she
to
know
me
thoroughlymany
things
had
been
outspoken
which
her
early
bashfulness
had
kept
covered
from
me
attempts
i
mean
to
pledge
her
love
to
this
one
or
that
other
some
of
which
perhaps
might
have
been
successful
if
there
had
not
been
too
many
and
then
as
her
beauty
grew
richer
and
brighter
carver
doone
was
smitten
strongly
and
would
hear
of
no
one
else
as
a
suitor
for
her
and
by
the
terror
of
his
claim
drove
off
all
the
others
here
too
may
the
explanation
of
a
thing
which
seemed
to
be
against
the
laws
of
human
nature
and
upon
which
i
longed
but
dared
not
to
crossquestion
lorna
how
could
such
a
lovely
girl
although
so
young
and
brave
and
distant
have
escaped
the
vile
affections
of
a
lawless
company
but
now
it
was
as
clear
as
need
be
for
any
proven
violence
would
have
utterly
vitiated
all
claim
upon
her
grand
estate
at
least
as
those
claims
must
be
urged
before
a
court
of
equity
and
therefore
all
the
elders
with
views
upon
her
real
estate
kept
strict
watch
on
the
youngers
who
confined
their
views
to
her
personality
now
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
this
or
the
hundred
other
things
which
came
crowding
consideration
were
half
as
plain
to
me
at
the
time
as
i
have
set
them
down
above
far
be
it
from
me
to
deceive
you
so
no
doubt
my
thoughts
were
then
dark
and
hazy
like
an
oillamp
full
of
fungus
and
i
have
trimmed
them
as
when
they
burned
with
scissors
sharpened
long
afterwards
all
i
mean
to
say
is
this
that
jogging
along
to
a
certain
tune
of
the
horses
feet
which
we
call
threehalfpence
and
twopence
i
saw
my
way
a
little
into
some
things
which
had
puzzled
me
when
i
knocked
at
the
little
door
whose
sill
was
gritty
and
grimed
with
sand
no
one
came
for
a
very
long
time
to
answer
me
or
to
let
me
in
not
wishing
to
be
unmannerly
i
waited
a
long
time
and
watched
the
sea
from
which
the
wind
was
blowing
and
whose
many
lips
of
wavesthough
the
tide
was
halfway
outspoke
to
and
refreshed
me
after
a
while
i
knocked
again
for
my
horse
was
becoming
hungry
and
a
good
while
after
that
again
a
voice
came
through
the
keyhole
who
is
that
wishes
to
enter
the
boy
who
was
at
the
pump
said
i
when
the
carriage
broke
down
at
dulverton
the
boy
that
lives
at
ohah
and
some
day
you
would
come
seek
for
him
oh
yes
i
remember
certainly
my
leetle
boy
with
the
fair
white
skin
i
have
desired
to
see
him
oh
many
yes
many
times
she
was
opening
the
door
while
saying
this
and
then
she
started
back
in
affright
that
the
little
boy
should
have
grown
so
you
cannot
be
that
leetle
boy
it
is
quite
impossible
why
do
you
impose
on
me
not
only
am
i
that
little
boy
who
made
the
water
to
flow
for
you
till
the
nebule
came
upon
the
glass
but
also
i
am
come
to
tell
you
all
about
your
little
girl
come
in
you
very
great
leetle
boy
she
answered
with
her
dark
eyes
brightened
and
i
went
in
and
looked
at
her
she
was
altered
by
time
as
much
as
i
was
the
slight
and
graceful
shape
was
gone
not
that
i
remembered
anything
of
her
figure
if
you
please
for
boys
of
twelve
are
not
yet
prone
to
note
the
shapes
of
women
but
that
her
lithe
straight
gait
had
struck
me
as
being
so
unlike
our
people
now
her
time
for
walking
so
was
past
and
transmitted
to
her
children
yet
her
face
was
comely
still
and
full
of
strong
intelligence
i
gazed
at
her
and
she
at
me
and
we
were
sure
of
one
another
now
what
will
ye
please
to
eat
she
asked
with
a
lively
glance
at
the
size
of
my
mouth
that
is
always
the
first
thing
you
people
ask
in
these
barbarous
places
i
will
tell
you
byandby
i
answered
misliking
this
satire
upon
us
but
i
might
begin
with
a
quart
of
ale
to
enable
me
to
speak
madam
very
well
one
quevart
of
beor
she
called
out
to
a
little
maid
who
was
her
eldest
child
no
doubt
it
is
to
be
expected
sir
beor
beor
beor
all
day
long
with
you
englishmen
nay
i
replied
not
all
day
long
if
madam
will
excuse
me
only
a
pint
at
breakfasttime
and
a
pint
and
a
half
at
eleven
oclock
and
a
quart
or
so
at
dinner
and
then
no
more
till
the
afternoon
and
half
a
gallon
at
suppertime
no
one
can
object
to
that
well
i
suppose
it
is
right
she
said
with
an
air
of
resignation
god
knows
but
i
do
not
understand
it
it
is
good
for
business
as
you
say
to
preclude
everything
and
it
is
good
for
us
madam
i
answered
with
indignation
for
beer
is
my
favourite
beverage
and
i
am
a
credit
to
beer
madam
and
so
are
all
who
trust
to
it
at
any
rate
you
are
young
man
if
beer
has
made
you
grow
so
large
i
will
put
my
children
upon
it
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
begin
the
smell
to
me
is
hateful
now
i
only
set
down
that
to
show
how
perverse
those
foreign
people
are
they
will
drink
their
wretched
heartless
stuff
such
as
they
call
claret
or
wine
of
medoc
or
bordeaux
or
what
not
with
no
more
meaning
than
sour
rennet
stirred
with
the
pulp
from
the
cider
press
and
strained
through
the
cap
of
our
betty
this
is
very
well
for
them
and
as
good
as
they
deserve
no
doubt
and
meant
perhaps
by
the
will
of
god
for
those
unhappy
natives
but
to
bring
it
over
to
england
and
set
it
against
our
homebrewed
ale
not
to
speak
of
wines
from
portugal
and
sell
it
at
ten
times
the
price
as
a
cure
for
british
bile
and
a
great
enlightenment
this
i
say
is
the
vilest
feature
of
the
age
we
live
in
madam
benita
odamfor
the
name
of
the
man
who
turned
the
wheel
proved
to
be
john
odamshowed
me
into
a
little
room
containing
two
chairs
and
a
firwood
table
and
sat
down
on
a
threelegged
seat
and
studied
me
very
steadfastly
this
she
had
a
right
to
do
and
i
having
all
my
clothes
on
now
was
not
disconcerted
it
would
not
become
me
to
repeat
her
judgment
upon
my
appearance
which
she
delivered
as
calmly
as
if
i
were
a
pig
at
market
and
as
proudly
as
if
her
own
pig
and
she
asked
me
whether
i
had
ever
got
rid
of
the
black
marks
on
my
breast
not
wanting
to
talk
about
myself
though
very
fond
of
doing
so
when
time
and
season
favour
i
led
her
back
to
that
fearful
night
of
the
day
when
first
i
had
seen
her
she
was
not
desirous
to
speak
of
it
because
of
her
own
little
children
however
i
drew
her
gradually
to
recollection
of
lorna
and
then
of
the
little
boy
who
died
and
the
poor
mother
buried
with
him
and
her
strong
hot
nature
kindled
as
she
dwelled
upon
these
things
and
my
wrath
waxed
within
me
and
we
forgot
reserve
and
prudence
under
the
sense
of
so
vile
a
wrong
she
told
me
as
nearly
as
might
be
the
very
same
story
which
she
had
told
to
master
jeremy
stickles
only
she
dwelled
upon
it
more
because
of
my
knowing
the
outset
and
being
a
woman
with
an
inkling
of
my
situation
she
enlarged
upon
the
little
maid
more
than
to
dry
jeremy
would
you
know
her
again
i
asked
being
stirred
by
these
accounts
of
lorna
when
she
was
five
years
old
would
you
know
her
as
a
fullgrown
maiden
i
think
i
should
she
answered
it
is
not
possible
to
say
until
one
sees
the
person
but
from
the
eyes
of
the
little
girl
i
think
that
i
must
know
her
oh
the
poor
young
creature
is
it
to
be
believed
that
the
cannibals
devoured
her
what
a
people
you
are
in
this
country
meat
meat
meat
as
she
raised
her
hands
and
eyes
in
horror
at
our
carnivorous
propensities
to
which
she
clearly
attributed
the
disappearance
of
lorna
i
could
scarce
help
laughing
even
after
that
sad
story
for
though
it
is
said
at
the
present
day
and
will
doubtless
be
said
hereafter
that
the
doones
had
devoured
a
baby
once
as
they
came
up
porlock
hill
after
fighting
hard
in
the
marketplace
i
knew
that
the
tale
was
utterly
false
for
cruel
and
brutal
as
they
were
their
taste
was
very
correct
and
choice
and
indeed
one
might
say
fastidious
nevertheless
i
could
not
stop
to
argue
that
matter
with
her
the
little
maid
has
not
been
devoured
i
said
to
mistress
odam
and
now
she
is
a
tall
young
lady
and
as
beautiful
as
can
be
if
i
sleep
in
your
good
hostel
tonight
after
going
to
watchett
town
will
you
come
with
me
to
oare
tomorrow
and
see
your
little
maiden
i
would
likeand
yet
i
fear
this
country
is
so
barbarous
and
i
am
good
to
eatmy
god
there
is
much
picking
on
my
bones
she
surveyed
herself
with
a
glance
so
mingled
of
pity
and
admiration
and
the
truth
of
her
words
was
so
apparent
only
that
it
would
have
taken
a
week
to
get
at
the
bones
before
picking
that
i
nearly
lost
good
manners
for
she
really
seemed
to
suspect
even
me
of
cannibal
inclinations
however
at
last
i
made
her
promise
to
come
with
me
on
the
morrow
presuming
that
master
odam
could
by
any
means
be
persuaded
to
keep
her
company
in
the
cart
as
propriety
demanded
having
little
doubt
that
master
odam
was
entirely
at
his
wifes
command
i
looked
upon
that
matter
as
settled
and
set
off
for
watchett
to
see
the
grave
of
lornas
poor
mother
and
to
hire
a
cart
for
the
morrow
and
here
as
so
often
happens
with
men
i
succeeded
without
any
trouble
or
hindrance
where
i
had
looked
for
both
of
them
namely
in
finding
a
suitable
cart
whereas
the
other
matter
in
which
i
could
have
expected
no
difficulty
came
very
near
to
defeat
me
for
when
i
heard
that
lornas
father
was
the
earl
of
dugalas
benita
impressed
upon
me
with
a
strong
enforcement
as
much
as
to
say
who
are
you
young
man
to
come
even
asking
about
herthen
i
never
thought
but
that
everybody
in
watchett
town
must
know
all
about
the
tombstone
of
the
countess
of
dugal
this
however
proved
otherwise
for
lord
dugal
had
never
lived
at
watchett
grange
as
their
place
was
called
neither
had
his
name
become
familiar
as
its
owner
because
the
grange
had
only
devolved
to
him
by
will
at
the
end
of
a
long
entail
when
the
last
of
the
fitzpains
died
out
and
though
he
liked
the
idea
of
it
he
had
gone
abroad
without
taking
seisin
and
upon
news
of
his
death
john
jones
a
rich
gentleman
from
llandaff
had
taken
possession
as
next
of
right
and
hushed
up
all
the
story
and
though
even
at
the
worst
of
times
a
lady
of
high
rank
and
wealth
could
not
be
robbed
and
as
bad
as
murdered
and
then
buried
in
a
little
place
without
moving
some
excitement
yet
it
had
been
given
out
on
purpose
and
with
diligence
that
this
was
only
a
foreign
lady
travelling
for
her
health
and
pleasure
along
the
seacoast
of
england
and
as
the
poor
thing
never
spoke
and
several
of
her
servants
and
her
baggage
looked
so
foreign
and
she
herself
died
in
a
collar
of
lace
unlike
any
made
in
england
all
watchett
without
hesitation
pronounced
her
to
be
a
foreigner
and
the
english
serving
man
and
maid
who
might
have
cleared
up
everything
either
were
bribed
by
master
jones
or
else
decamped
of
their
own
accord
with
the
relics
of
the
baggage
so
the
poor
countess
of
dugal
almost
in
sight
of
her
own
grand
house
was
buried
in
an
unknown
grave
with
her
pair
of
infants
without
a
plate
without
a
tombstone
worse
than
all
without
a
tear
except
from
the
hired
italian
woman
surely
my
poor
lorna
came
of
an
illstarred
family
now
in
spite
of
all
this
if
i
had
only
taken
benita
with
me
or
even
told
her
what
i
wished
and
craved
her
directions
there
could
have
been
no
trouble
but
i
do
assure
you
that
among
the
stupid
people
at
watchett
compared
with
whom
our
folk
of
oare
exceeding
dense
though
being
are
as
hamlet
against
dogberry
what
with
one
of
them
and
another
and
the
firm
conviction
of
all
the
town
that
i
could
be
come
only
to
wrestle
i
do
assure
you
as
i
said
before
that
my
wits
almost
went
out
of
me
and
what
vexed
me
yet
more
about
it
was
that
i
saw
my
own
mistake
in
coming
myself
to
seek
out
the
matter
instead
of
sending
some
unknown
person
for
my
face
and
form
were
known
at
that
time
and
still
are
so
to
nine
people
out
of
every
ten
living
in
forty
miles
of
me
not
through
any
excellence
or
anything
of
good
desert
in
either
the
one
or
the
other
but
simply
because
folks
will
be
fools
on
the
rivalry
of
wrestling
the
art
is
a
fine
one
in
itself
and
demands
a
little
wit
of
brain
as
well
as
strength
of
body
it
binds
the
man
who
studies
it
to
temperance
and
chastity
to
selfrespect
and
most
of
all
to
an
even
and
sweet
temper
for
i
have
thrown
stronger
men
than
myself
when
i
was
a
mere
sapling
and
before
my
strength
grew
hard
on
me
through
their
loss
of
temper
but
though
the
art
is
an
honest
one
surely
they
who
excel
therein
have
a
right
like
all
the
rest
of
mankind
to
their
own
private
life
be
that
either
wayand
i
will
not
speak
too
strongly
for
fear
of
indulging
my
own
annoyanceanyhow
all
watchett
town
cared
ten
times
as
much
to
see
john
ridd
as
to
show
him
what
he
wanted
i
was
led
to
every
publichouse
instead
of
to
the
churchyard
and
twenty
tables
were
ready
for
me
in
lieu
of
a
single
gravestone
zummerzett
thou
beest
jan

and

thou
shalt

carl
theezell

davonsheer
man
whoy
thee
lives
in
zummerzett
and
in
zummerzett
thee
wast
barn
lad
and
so
it
went
on
till
i
was
weary
though
very
much
obliged
to
them
dull
and
solid
as
i
am
and
with
a
wild
duck
waiting
for
me
at
good
mistress
odams
i
saw
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
yield
to
these
good
people
and
prove
me
a
man
of
somerset
by
eating
a
dinner
at
their
expense
as
for
the
churchyard
none
would
hear
of
it
and
i
grieved
for
broaching
the
matter
but
how
was
i
to
meet
lorna
again
without
having
done
the
thing
of
all
things
which
i
had
promised
to
see
to
it
would
never
do
to
tell
her
that
so
great
was
my
popularity
and
so
strong
the
desire
to
feed
me
that
i
could
not
attend
to
her
mother
least
of
all
could
i
say
that
every
one
in
watchett
knew
john
ridd
while
none
had
heard
of
the
countess
of
dugal
and
yet
that
was
about
the
truth
as
i
hinted
very
delicately
to
mistress
odam
that
evening
but
she
being
vexed
about
her
wild
duck
and
not
having
english
ideas
on
the
matter
of
sport
and
so
on
made
a
poor
unwitting
face
at
me
nevertheless
master
odam
restored
me
to
my
selfrespect
for
he
stared
at
me
till
i
went
to
bed
and
he
broke
his
hose
with
excitement
for
being
in
the
legline
myself
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
muscles
were
of
a
man
who
turned
a
wheel
all
day
i
had
never
seen
a
treadmill
though
they
have
one
now
at
exeter
and
it
touched
me
much
to
learn
whether
it
were
good
exercise
and
herein
from
what
i
saw
of
odam
i
incline
to
think
that
it
does
great
harm
as
moving
the
muscles
too
much
in
a
line
and
without
variety
chapter
lvii
lorna
knows
her
nurse
having
obtained
from
benita
odam
a
very
close
and
full
description
of
the
place
where
her
poor
mistress
lay
and
the
marks
whereby
to
know
it
i
hastened
to
watchett
the
following
morning
before
the
sun
was
up
or
any
people
were
about
and
so
without
interruption
i
was
in
the
churchyard
at
sunrise
in
the
farthest
and
darkest
nook
overgrown
with
grass
and
overhung
by
a
weepingtree
a
little
bank
of
earth
betokened
the
rounding
off
of
a
hapless
life
there
was
nothing
to
tell
of
rank
or
wealth
of
love
or
even
pity
nameless
as
a
peasant
lay
the
last
as
supposed
of
a
mighty
race
only
some
unskilful
hand
probably
master
odams
under
his
wifes
teaching
had
carved
a
rude
l
and
a
ruder
d
upon
a
large
pebble
from
the
beach
and
set
it
up
as
a
headstone
i
gathered
a
little
grass
for
lorna
and
a
sprig
of
the
weepingtree
and
then
returned
to
the
forest

for
the
way
is
long
from
watchett
to
oare
and
though
you
may
ride
it
rapidly
as
the
doones
had
done
on
that
fatal
night
to
travel
on
wheels
with
one
horse
only
is
a
matter
of
time
and
of
prudence
therefore
we
set
out
pretty
early
three
of
us
and
a
baby
who
could
not
well
be
left
behind
the
wife
of
the
man
who
owned
the
cart
had
undertaken
to
mind
the
business
and
the
other
babies
upon
condition
of
having
the
keys
of
all
the
taps
left
with
her
as
the
manner
of
journeying
over
the
moor
has
been
described
oft
enough
already
i
will
say
no
more
except
that
we
all
arrived
before
dusk
of
the
summers
day
safe
at
plovers
barrows
mistress
benita
was
delighted
with
the
change
from
her
dull
hard
life
and
she
made
many
excellent
observations
such
as
seem
natural
to
a
foreigner
looking
at
our
country
as
luck
would
have
it
the
first
who
came
to
meet
us
at
the
gate
was
lorna
with
nothing
whatever
upon
her
head
the
weather
being
summerly
but
her
beautiful
hair
shed
round
her
and
wearing
a
sweet
white
frock
tucked
in
and
showing
her
figure
perfectly
in
her
joy
she
ran
straight
up
to
the
cart
and
then
stopped
and
gazed
at
benita
at
one
glance
her
old
nurse
knew
her
oh
the
eyes
the
eyes
she
cried
and
was
over
the
rail
of
the
cart
in
a
moment
in
spite
of
all
her
substance
lorna
on
the
other
hand
looked
at
her
with
some
doubt
and
wonder
as
though
having
right
to
know
much
about
her
and
yet
unable
to
do
so
but
when
the
foreign
woman
said
something
in
roman
language
and
flung
new
hay
from
the
cart
upon
her
as
if
in
a
romp
of
childhood
the
young
maid
cried
oh
nita
nita
and
fell
upon
her
breast
and
wept
and
after
that
looked
round
at
us
this
being
so
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
proving
lady
lornas
birth
and
rights
both
by
evidence
and
token
for
though
we
had
not
the
necklace
nowthanks
to
annies
wisdomwe
had
the
ring
of
heavy
gold
a
very
ancient
relic
with
which
my
maid
in
her
simple
way
had
pledged
herself
to
me
and
benita
knew
this
ring
as
well
as
she
knew
her
own
fingers
having
heard
a
long
history
about
it
and
the
effigy
on
it
of
the
wild
cat
was
the
bearing
of
the
house
of
lorne
for
though
lornas
father
was
a
nobleman
of
high
and
goodly
lineage
her
mother
was
of
yet
more
ancient
and
renowned
descent
being
the
last
in
line
direct
from
the
great
and
kingly
chiefs
of
lorne
a
wild
and
headstrong
race
they
were
and
must
have
everything
their
own
way
hot
blood
was
ever
among
them
even
of
one
household
and
their
sovereignty
which
more
than
once
had
defied
the
king
of
scotland
waned
and
fell
among
themselves
by
continual
quarrelling
and
it
was
of
a
piece
with
this
that
the
doones
who
were
an
offset
by
the
mothers
side
holding
in
copartnership
some
large
property
which
had
come
by
the
spindle
as
we
say
should
fall
out
with
the
earl
of
lorne
the
last
but
one
of
that
title
the
daughter
of
this
nobleman
had
married
sir
ensor
doone
but
this
instead
of
healing
matters
led
to
fiercer
conflict
i
never
could
quite
understand
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
which
none
but
a
lawyer
may
go
through
and
keep
his
head
at
the
end
of
it
the
motives
of
mankind
are
plainer
than
the
motions
they
produce
especially
when
charity
such
as
found
among
us
sits
to
judge
the
former
and
is
never
weary
of
it
while
reason
does
not
care
to
trace
the
latter
complications
except
for
fee
or
title
therefore
it
is
enough
to
say
that
knowing
lorna
to
be
direct
in
heirship
to
vast
property
and
bearing
especial
spite
against
the
house
of
which
she
was
the
last
the
doones
had
brought
her
up
with
full
intention
of
lawful
marriage
and
had
carefully
secluded
her
from
the
wildest
of
their
young
gallants
of
course
if
they
had
been
next
in
succession
the
child
would
have
gone
down
the
waterfall
to
save
any
further
trouble
but
there
was
an
intercepting
branch
of
some
honest
family
and
they
being
outlaws
would
have
a
poor
chance
though
the
law
loves
outlaws
against
them
only
lorna
was
of
the
stock
and
lorna
they
must
marry
and
what
a
triumph
against
the
old
earl
for
a
cursed
doone
to
succeed
him
as
for
their
outlawry
great
robberies
and
grand
murders
the
veriest
child
nowadays
must
know
that
money
heals
the
whole
of
that
even
if
they
had
murdered
people
of
a
good
position
it
would
only
cost
about
twice
as
much
to
prove
their
motives
loyal
but
they
had
never
slain
any
man
above
the
rank
of
yeoman
and
folk
even
said
that
my
father
was
the
highest
of
their
victims
for
the
death
of
lornas
mother
and
brother
was
never
set
to
their
account
pure
pleasure
it
is
to
any
man
to
reflect
upon
all
these
things
how
truly
we
discern
clear
justice
and
how
well
we
deal
it
if
any
poor
man
steals
a
sheep
having
ten
children
starving
and
regarding
it
as
mountain
game
as
a
rich
man
does
a
hare
to
the
gallows
with
him
if
a
man
of
rank
beats
down
a
door
smites
the
owner
upon
the
head
and
honours
the
wife
with
attention
it
is
a
thing
to
be
grateful
for
and
to
slouch
smitten
head
the
lower
while
we
were
full
of
all
these
things
and
wondering
what
would
happen
next
or
what
we
ought
ourselves
to
do
another
very
important
matter
called
for
our
attention
this
was
no
less
than
annies
marriage
to
the
squire
faggus
we
had
tried
to
put
it
off
again
for
in
spite
of
all
advantages
neither
my
mother
nor
myself
had
any
real
heart
for
it
not
that
we
dwelled
upon
toms
shortcomings
or
rather
perhaps
his
going
too
far
at
the
time
when
he
worked
the
road
so
all
that
was
covered
by
the
kings
pardon
and
universal
respect
of
the
neighbourhood
but
our
scruple
was
thisand
the
more
we
talked
the
more
it
grew
upon
usthat
we
both
had
great
misgivings
as
to
his
future
steadiness
for
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
we
said
for
a
fine
wellgrown
and
pretty
maiden
such
as
our
annie
was
useful
too
in
so
many
ways
and
lively
and
warmhearted
and
mistress
of
500
pounds
to
throw
herself
away
on
a
man
with
a
kind
of
a
turn
for
drinking
if
that
last
were
even
hinted
annie
would
be
most
indignant
and
ask
with
cheeks
as
red
as
roses
who
had
ever
seen
master
faggus
any
the
worse
for
liquor
indeed
her
own
opinion
was
in
truth
that
he
took
a
great
deal
too
little
after
all
his
hard
work
and
hard
riding
and
coming
over
the
hills
to
be
insulted
and
if
ever
it
lay
in
her
power
and
with
no
one
to
grudge
him
his
trumpery
glass
she
would
see
that
poor
tom
had
the
nourishment
which
his
cough
and
his
lungs
required
his
lungs
being
quite
as
sound
as
mine
this
matter
was
out
of
all
argument
so
mother
and
i
looked
at
one
another
as
much
as
to
say
let
her
go
upstairs
she
will
cry
and
come
down
more
reasonable
and
while
she
was
gone
we
used
to
say
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
but
without
perceiving
a
cure
for
it
and
we
almost
always
finished
up
with
the
following
reflection
which
sometimes
came
from
mothers
lips
and
sometimes
from
my
own
well
well
there
is
no
telling
none
can
say
how
a
man
may
alter
when
he
takes
to
matrimony
but
if
we
could
only
make
annie
promise
to
be
a
little
firm
with
him
i
fear
that
all
this
talk
on
our
part
only
hurried
matters
forward
annie
being
more
determined
every
time
we
pitied
her
and
at
last
tom
faggus
came
and
spoke
as
if
he
were
on
the
kings
road
with
a
pistol
at
my
head
and
one
at
mothers
no
more
fast
and
loose
he
cried
either
one
thing
or
the
other
i
love
the
maid
and
she
loves
me
and
we
will
have
one
another
either
with
your
leave
or
without
it
how
many
more
times
am
i
to
dance
over
these
vile
hills
and
leave
my
business
and
get
nothing
more
than
a
sigh
or
a
kiss
and
tom
i
must
wait
for
mother
you
are
famous
for
being
straightforward
you
ridds
just
treat
me
as
i
would
treat
you
now
i
looked
at
my
mother
for
a
glance
from
her
would
have
sent
tom
out
of
the
window
but
she
checked
me
with
her
hand
and
said
you
have
some
ground
of
complaint
sir
i
will
not
deny
it
now
i
will
be
as
straightforward
with
you
as
even
a
ridd
is
supposed
to
be
my
son
and
myself
have
all
along
disliked
your
marriage
with
annie
not
for
what
you
have
been
so
much
as
for
what
we
fear
you
will
be
have
patience
one
moment
if
you
please
we
do
not
fear
your
taking
to
the
highway
life
again
for
that
you
are
too
clever
no
doubt
now
that
you
have
property
but
we
fear
that
you
will
take
to
drinking
and
to
squandering
money
there
are
many
examples
of
this
around
us
and
we
know
what
the
fate
of
the
wife
is
it
has
been
hard
to
tell
you
this
under
our
own
roof
and
with
our
own
here
mother
hesitated
spirits
and
cider
and
beer
i
broke
in
out
with
it
like
a
ridd
mother
as
he
will
have
all
of
it
spirits
and
cider
and
beer
said
mother
very
firmly
after
me
and
then
she
gave
way
and
said
you
know
tom
you
are
welcome
to
every
drop
and
more
of
it
now
tom
must
have
had
a
far
sweeter
temper
than
ever
i
could
claim
for
i
should
have
thrust
my
glass
away
and
never
have
taken
another
drop
in
the
house
where
such
a
check
had
met
me
but
instead
of
that
master
faggus
replied
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
know
that
i
am
welcome
good
mother
and
to
prove
it
i
will
have
some
more
and
thereupon
be
mixed
himself
another
glass
of
hollands
with
lemon
and
hot
water
yet
pouring
it
very
delicately
oh
i
have
been
so
miserabletake
a
little
more
tom
said
mother
handing
the
bottle
yes
take
a
little
more
i
said
you
have
mixed
it
over
weak
tom
if
ever
there
was
a
sober
man
cried
tom
complying
with
our
request
if
ever
there
was
in
christendom
a
man
of
perfect
sobriety
that
man
is
now
before
you
shall
we
say
tomorrow
week
mother
it
will
suit
your
washing
day
how
very
thoughtful
you
are
tom
now
john
would
never
have
thought
of
that
in
spite
of
all
his
steadiness
certainly
not
i
answered
proudly
when
my
time
comes
for
lorna
i
shall
not
study
betty
muxworthy
in
this
way
the
squire
got
over
us
and
farmer
nicholas
snowe
was
sent
for
to
counsel
with
mother
about
the
matter
and
to
set
his
two
daughters
sewing
when
the
time
for
the
wedding
came
there
was
such
a
stir
and
commotion
as
had
never
been
known
in
the
parish
of
oare
since
my
fathers
marriage
for
annies
beauty
and
kindliness
had
made
her
the
pride
of
the
neighbourhood
and
the
presents
sent
her
from
all
around
were
enough
to
stock
a
shop
with
master
stickles
who
now
could
walk
and
who
certainly
owed
his
recovery
with
the
blessing
of
god
to
annie
presented
her
with
a
mighty
bible
silverclasped
and
very
handsome
beating
the
parsons
out
and
out
and
for
which
he
had
sent
to
taunton
even
the
common
troopers
having
tasted
her
cookery
many
times
to
help
out
their
poor
rations
clubbed
together
and
must
have
given
at
least
a
weeks
pay
apiece
to
have
turned
out
what
they
did
for
her
this
was
no
less
than
a
silver
pot
welldesigned
but
suited
surely
rather
to
the
bridegrooms
taste
than
brides
in
a
word
everybody
gave
her
things
and
now
my
lorna
came
to
me
with
a
spring
of
tears
in
appealing
eyesfor
she
was
still
somewhat
childish
or
rather
i
should
say
more
childish
now
than
when
she
lived
in
miseryand
she
placed
her
little
hand
in
mine
and
she
was
half
afraid
to
speak
and
dropped
her
eyes
for
me
to
ask
what
is
it
little
darling
i
asked
as
i
saw
her
breath
come
fast
for
the
smallest
emotion
moved
her
form
you
dont
think
john
you
dont
think
dear
that
you
could
lend
me
any
money
all
i
have
got
i
answered
how
much
do
you
want
dear
heart
i
have
been
calculating
and
i
fear
that
i
cannot
do
any
good
with
less
than
ten
pounds
john
here
she
looked
up
at
me
with
horror
at
the
grandeur
of
the
sum
and
not
knowing
what
i
could
think
of
it
but
i
kept
my
eyes
from
her
ten
pounds
i
said
in
my
deepest
voice
on
purpose
to
have
it
out
in
comfort
when
she
should
be
frightened
what
can
you
want
with
ten
pounds
child
that
is
my
concern
said
lorna
plucking
up
her
spirit
at
this
when
a
lady
asks
for
a
loan
no
gentleman
pries
into
the
cause
of
her
asking
it
that
may
be
as
may
be
i
answered
in
a
judicial
manner
ten
pounds
or
twenty
you
shall
have
but
i
must
know
the
purport
then
that
you
never
shall
know
john
i
am
very
sorry
for
asking
you
it
is
not
of
the
smallest
consequence
oh
dear
no
herewith
she
was
running
away
oh
dear
yes
i
replied
it
is
of
very
great
consequence
and
i
understand
the
whole
of
it
you
want
to
give
that
stupid
annie
who
has
lost
you
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
who
is
going
to
be
married
before
us
deargod
only
can
tell
why
being
my
younger
sisteryou
want
to
give
her
a
wedding
present
and
you
shall
do
it
darling
because
it
is
so
good
of
you
dont
you
know
your
title
love
how
humble
you
are
with
us
humble
folk
you
are
lady
lorna
something
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
yet
and
you
ought
not
even
to
speak
to
us
you
will
go
away
and
disdain
us
if
you
please
talk
not
like
that
john
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
it
comes
between
you
and
me
john
you
cannot
help
yourself
said
i
and
then
she
vowed
that
she
could
and
would
and
rank
and
birth
were
banished
from
between
our
lips
in
no
time
what
can
i
get
her
good
enough
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
she
asked
she
has
been
so
kind
and
good
to
me
and
she
is
such
a
darling
how
i
shall
miss
her
to
be
sure
by
the
bye
you
seem
to
think
john
that
i
shall
be
rich
some
day
of
course
you
will
as
rich
as
the
french
king
who
keeps
ours
would
the
lord
chancellor
trouble
himself
about
you
if
you
were
poor
then
if
i
am
rich
perhaps
you
would
lend
me
twenty
pounds
dear
john
ten
pounds
would
be
very
mean
for
a
wealthy
person
to
give
her
to
this
i
agreed
upon
condition
that
i
should
make
the
purchase
myself
whatever
it
might
be
for
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
cheat
lorna
about
the
cost
until
time
should
come
for
her
paying
me
and
this
was
better
than
to
cheat
her
for
the
benefit
of
our
family
for
this
end
and
for
many
others
i
set
off
to
dulverton
bearing
more
commissions
more
messages
and
more
questions
than
a
man
of
thrice
my
memory
might
carry
so
far
as
the
corner
where
the
sawpit
is
and
to
make
things
worse
one
girl
or
other
would
keep
on
running
up
to
me
or
even
after
me
when
started
with
something
or
other
she
had
just
thought
of
which
she
could
not
possibly
do
without
and
which
i
must
be
sure
to
remember
as
the
most
important
of
the
whole
to
my
dear
mother
who
had
partly
outlived
the
exceeding
value
of
trifles
the
most
important
matter
seemed
to
ensure
uncle
reubens
countenance
and
presence
at
the
marriage
and
if
i
succeeded
in
this
i
might
well
forget
all
the
maidens
trumpery
this
she
would
have
been
wiser
to
tell
me
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
for
i
left
her
to
fight
her
own
battle
with
them
and
laughing
at
her
predicament
promised
to
do
the
best
i
could
for
all
so
far
as
my
wits
would
go
uncle
reuben
was
not
at
home
but
ruth
who
received
me
very
kindly
although
without
any
expressions
of
joy
was
sure
of
his
return
in
the
afternoon
and
persuaded
me
to
wait
for
him
and
by
the
time
that
i
had
finished
all
i
could
recollect
of
my
orders
even
with
paper
to
help
me
the
old
gentleman
rode
into
the
yard
and
was
more
surprised
than
pleased
to
see
me
but
if
he
was
surprised
i
was
more
than
thati
was
utterly
astonished
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
since
the
last
time
i
had
seen
him
from
a
hale
and
rather
heavy
man
grayhaired
but
plump
and
ruddy
he
was
altered
to
a
shrunken
wizened
trembling
and
almost
decrepit
figure
instead
of
curly
and
comely
locks
grizzled
indeed
but
plentiful
he
had
only
a
few
lank
white
hairs
scattered
and
flattened
upon
his
forehead
but
the
greatest
change
of
all
was
in
the
expression
of
his
eyes
which
had
been
so
keen
and
restless
and
bright
and
a
little
sarcastic
bright
indeed
they
still
were
but
with
a
slow
unhealthy
lustre
their
keenness
was
turned
to
perpetual
outlook
their
restlessness
to
a
haggard
want
as
for
the
humour
which
once
gleamed
there
which
people
who
fear
it
call
sarcasm
it
had
been
succeeded
by
stares
of
terror
and
then
mistrust
and
shrinking
there
was
none
of
the
interest
in
mankind
which
is
needful
even
for
satire
now
what
can
this
be
thought
i
to
myself
has
the
old
man
lost
all
his
property
or
taken
too
much
to
strong
waters
come
inside
john
ridd
he
said
i
will
have
a
talk
with
you
it
is
cold
out
here
and
it
is
too
light
come
inside
john
ridd
boy
i
followed
him
into
a
little
dark
room
quite
different
from
ruth
huckabacks
it
was
closed
from
the
shop
by
an
old
division
of
boarding
hung
with
tanned
canvas
and
the
smell
was
very
close
and
faint
here
there
was
a
ledger
desk
and
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
longlegged
stool
take
the
stool
said
uncle
reuben
showing
me
in
very
quietly
it
is
fitter
for
your
height
john
wait
a
moment
there
is
no
hurry
then
he
slipped
out
by
another
door
and
closing
it
quickly
after
him
told
the
foreman
and
waitingmen
that
the
business
of
the
day
was
done
they
had
better
all
go
home
at
once
and
he
would
see
to
the
fastenings
of
course
they
were
only
too
glad
to
go
but
i
wondered
at
his
sending
them
with
at
least
two
hours
of
daylight
left
however
that
was
no
business
of
mine
and
i
waited
and
pondered
whether
fair
ruth
ever
came
into
this
dirty
room
and
if
so
how
she
kept
her
hands
from
it
for
annie
would
have
had
it
upside
down
in
about
two
minutes
and
scrubbed
and
brushed
and
dusted
until
it
looked
quite
another
place
and
yet
all
this
done
without
scolding
and
crossness
which
are
the
curse
of
clean
women
and
ten
times
worse
than
the
dustiest
dust
uncle
ben
came
reeling
in
not
from
any
power
of
liquor
but
because
he
was
stiff
from
horseback
and
weak
from
work
and
worry
let
me
be
john
let
me
be
he
said
as
i
went
to
help
him
this
is
an
unkind
dreary
place
but
many
a
hundred
of
good
gold
carolus
has
been
turned
in
this
place
john
not
a
doubt
about
it
sir
i
answered
in
my
loud
and
cheerful
manner
and
many
another
hundred
sir
and
may
you
long
enjoy
them
my
boy
do
you
wish
me
to
die
he
asked
coming
up
close
to
my
stool
and
regarding
me
with
a
shrewd
though
bleareyed
gaze
many
do
do
you
john
come
said
i
dont
ask
such
nonsense
you
know
better
than
that
uncle
ben
or
else
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
want
you
to
live
as
long
as
possible
for
the
sake
of
here
i
stopped
for
the
sake
of
what
john
i
knew
it
is
not
for
my
own
sake
for
the
sake
of
what
my
boy
for
the
sake
of
ruth
i
answered
if
you
must
have
all
the
truth
who
is
to
mind
her
when
you
are
gone
but
if
you
knew
that
i
had
gold
or
a
manner
of
getting
gold
far
more
than
ever
the
sailors
got
out
of
the
spanish
galleons
far
more
than
ever
was
heard
of
and
the
secret
was
to
be
yours
john
yours
after
me
and
no
other
soulsthen
you
would
wish
me
dead
john
here
he
eyed
me
as
if
a
speck
of
dust
in
my
eyes
should
not
escape
him
you
are
wrong
uncle
ben
altogether
wrong
for
all
the
gold
ever
heard
or
dreamed
of
not
a
wish
would
cross
my
heart
to
rob
you
of
one
day
of
life
at
last
he
moved
his
eyes
from
mine
but
without
any
word
or
sign
to
show
whether
he
believed
or
disbelieved
then
he
went
to
a
chair
and
sat
with
his
chin
upon
the
ledgerdesk
as
if
the
effort
of
probing
me
had
been
too
much
for
his
weary
brain
dreamed
of
all
the
gold
ever
dreamed
of
as
if
it
were
but
a
dream
he
muttered
and
then
he
closed
his
eyes
to
think
good
uncle
reuben
i
said
to
him
you
have
been
a
long
way
today
sir
let
me
go
and
get
you
a
glass
of
good
wine
cousin
ruth
knows
where
to
find
it
how
do
you
know
how
far
i
have
been
he
asked
with
a
vicious
look
at
me
and
cousin
ruth
you
are
very
pat
with
my
granddaughters
name
young
man
it
would
be
hard
upon
me
sir
not
to
know
my
own
cousins
name
very
well
let
that
go
by
you
have
behaved
very
badly
to
ruth
she
loves
you
and
you
love
her
not
at
this
i
was
so
wholly
amazednot
at
the
thing
itself
i
mean
but
at
his
knowledge
of
itthat
i
could
not
say
a
single
word
but
looked
no
doubt
very
foolish
you
may
well
be
ashamed
young
man
he
cried
with
some
triumph
over
me
you
are
the
biggest
of
all
fools
as
well
as
a
conceited
coxcomb
what
can
you
want
more
than
ruth
she
is
a
little
damsel
truly
but
finer
men
than
you
john
ridd
with
all
your
boasted
strength
and
wrestling
have
wedded
smaller
maidens
and
as
for
quality
and
valuebots
one
inch
of
ruth
is
worth
all
your
seven
feet
put
together
now
i
am
not
seven
feet
high
nor
ever
was
six
feet
eight
inches
in
my
very
prime
of
life
and
nothing
vexes
me
so
much
as
to
make
me
out
a
giant
and
above
human
sympathy
and
human
scale
of
weakness
it
cost
me
hard
to
hold
my
tongue
which
luckily
is
not
in
proportion
to
my
stature
and
only
for
ruths
sake
i
held
it
but
uncle
ben
being
old
and
worn
was
vexed
by
not
having
any
answer
almost
as
much
as
a
woman
is
you
want
me
to
go
on
he
continued
with
a
look
of
spite
at
me
about
my
poor
ruths
love
for
you
to
feed
your
cursed
vanity
because
a
set
of
asses
call
you
the
finest
man
in
england
there
is
no
maid
i
suppose
who
is
not
in
love
with
you
i
believe
you
are
as
deep
as
you
are
long
john
ridd
shall
i
ever
get
to
the
bottom
of
your
character
this
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
any
insult
i
could
take
with
goodwill
from
a
whitehaired
man
and
one
who
was
my
relative
unless
it
touched
my
love
for
lorna
or
my
conscious
modesty
now
both
of
these
were
touched
to
the
quick
by
the
sentences
of
the
old
gentleman
therefore
without
a
word
i
went
only
making
a
bow
to
him
but
women
who
are
beyond
all
doubt
the
mothers
of
all
mischief
also
nurse
that
babe
to
sleep
when
he
is
too
noisy
and
there
was
ruth
as
i
took
my
horse
with
a
trunk
of
frippery
on
him
poor
little
ruth
was
at
the
bridle
and
rusting
all
the
knops
of
our
towngoing
harness
with
tears
goodbye
dear
i
said
as
she
bent
her
head
away
from
me
shall
i
put
you
up
on
the
saddle
dear
cousin
ridd
you
may
take
it
lightly
said
ruth
turning
full
upon
me
and
very
likely
you
are
right
according
to
your
naturethis
was
the
only
cutting
thing
the
little
soul
ever
said
to
mebut
oh
cousin
ridd
you
have
no
idea
of
the
pain
you
will
leave
behind
you
how
can
that
be
so
ruth
when
i
am
as
good
as
ordered
to
be
off
the
premises
in
the
first
place
cousin
ridd
grandfather
will
be
angry
with
himself
for
having
so
illused
you
and
now
he
is
so
weak
and
poorly
that
he
is
always
repenting
in
the
next
place
i
shall
scold
him
first
until
he
admits
his
sorrow
and
when
he
has
admitted
it
i
shall
scold
myself
for
scolding
him
and
then
he
will
come
round
again
and
think
that
i
was
hard
on
him
and
end
perhaps
by
hating
youfor
he
is
like
a
woman
now
john
that
last
little
touch
of
selfknowledge
in
ruth
which
she
delivered
with
a
gleam
of
some
secret
pleasantry
made
me
stop
and
look
closely
at
her
but
she
pretended
not
to
know
it
there
is
something
in
this
child
i
thought
very
different
from
other
girls
what
it
is
i
cannot
tell
for
one
very
seldom
gets
at
it
at
any
rate
the
upshot
was
that
the
good
horse
went
back
to
stable
and
had
another
feed
of
corn
while
my
wrath
sank
within
me
there
are
two
things
according
to
my
experience
which
may
not
hold
with
another
man
fitted
beyond
any
others
to
take
hot
tempers
out
of
us
the
first
is
to
see
our
favourite
creatures
feeding
and
licking
up
their
food
and
happily
snuffling
over
it
yet
sparing
time
to
be
grateful
and
showing
taste
and
perception
the
other
is
to
go
gardening
boldly
in
the
spring
of
the
year
without
any
misgiving
about
it
and
hoping
the
utmost
of
everything
if
there
be
a
third
anodyne
approaching
these
two
in
power
it
is
to
smoke
good
tobacco
well
and
watch
the
setting
of
the
moon
and
if
this
should
only
be
over
the
sea
the
result
is
irresistible
master
huckaback
showed
no
especial
signs
of
joy
at
my
return
but
received
me
with
a
little
grunt
which
appeared
to
me
to
mean
ah
i
thought
he
would
hardly
be
fool
enough
to
go
i
told
him
how
sorry
i
was
for
having
in
some
way
offended
him
and
he
answered
that
i
did
well
to
grieve
for
one
at
least
of
my
offences
to
this
i
made
no
reply
as
behoves
a
man
dealing
with
cross
and
fractious
people
and
presently
he
became
bettertempered
and
sent
little
ruth
for
a
bottle
of
wine
she
gave
me
a
beautiful
smile
of
thanks
for
my
forbearance
as
she
passed
and
i
knew
by
her
manner
that
she
would
bring
the
best
bottle
in
all
the
cellar
as
i
had
but
little
time
to
spare
although
the
days
were
long
and
light
we
were
forced
to
take
our
wine
with
promptitude
and
rapidity
and
whether
this
loosened
my
uncles
tongue
or
whether
he
meant
beforehand
to
speak
is
now
almost
uncertain
but
true
it
is
that
he
brought
his
chair
very
near
to
mine
after
three
or
four
glasses
and
sent
ruth
away
upon
some
errand
which
seemed
of
small
importance
at
this
i
was
vexed
for
the
room
always
looked
so
different
without
her
come
jack
he
said
heres
your
health
young
fellow
and
a
good
and
obedient
wife
to
you
not
that
your
wife
will
ever
obey
you
though
you
are
much
too
easytempered
even
a
bitter
and
stormy
woman
might
live
in
peace
with
you
jack
but
never
you
give
her
the
chance
to
try
marry
some
sweet
little
thing
if
you
can
if
not
dont
marry
any
ah
we
have
the
maid
to
suit
you
my
lad
in
this
old
town
of
dulverton
have
you
so
sir
but
perhaps
the
maid
might
have
no
desire
to
suit
me
that
you
may
take
my
word
she
has
the
colour
of
this
wine
will
prove
it
the
little
sly
hussy
has
been
to
the
cobwebbed
arch
of
the
cellar
where
she
has
no
right
to
go
for
any
one
under
a
magistrate
however
i
am
glad
to
see
it
and
we
will
not
spare
it
john
after
my
time
somebody
whoever
marries
little
ruth
will
find
some
rare
wines
there
i
trow
and
perhaps
not
know
the
difference
thinking
of
this
the
old
man
sighed
and
expected
me
to
sigh
after
him
but
a
sigh
is
not
like
a
yawn
infectious
and
we
are
all
more
prone
to
be
sent
to
sleep
than
to
sorrow
by
one
another
not
but
what
a
sigh
sometimes
may
make
us
think
of
sighing
well
sir
cried
i
in
my
sprightliest
manner
which
rouses
up
most
people
heres
to
your
health
and
dear
little
ruths
and
may
you
live
to
knock
off
the
cobwebs
from
every
bottle
in
under
the
arch
uncle
reuben
your
life
and
health
sir
with
that
i
took
my
glass
thoughtfully
for
it
was
wondrous
good
and
uncle
ben
was
pleased
to
see
me
dwelling
pleasantly
on
the
subject
with
parenthesis
and
selfcommune
and
oral
judgment
unpronounced
though
smacking
of
fine
decision
curia
vult
advisari
as
the
lawyers
say
which
means
let
us
have
another
glass
and
then
we
can
think
about
it
come
now
john
said
uncle
ben
laying
his
wrinkled
hand
on
my
knee
when
he
saw
that
none
could
heed
us
i
know
that
you
have
a
sneaking
fondness
for
my
grandchild
ruth
dont
interrupt
me
now
you
have
and
to
deny
it
will
only
provoke
me
i
do
like
ruth
sir
i
said
boldly
for
fear
of
misunderstanding
but
i
do
not
love
her
very
well
that
makes
no
difference
liking
may
very
soon
be
loving
as
some
people
call
it
when
the
maid
has
money
to
help
her
but
if
there
be
as
there
is
in
my
case
once
for
all
john
not
a
word
i
do
not
attempt
to
lead
you
into
any
engagement
with
little
ruth
neither
will
i
blame
you
though
i
may
be
disappointed
if
no
such
engagement
should
ever
be
but
whether
you
will
have
my
grandchild
or
whether
you
will
notand
such
a
chance
is
rarely
offered
to
a
fellow
of
your
standinguncle
ben
despised
all
farmersin
any
case
i
have
at
least
resolved
to
let
you
know
my
secret
and
for
two
good
reasons
the
first
is
that
it
wears
me
out
to
dwell
upon
it
all
alone
and
the
second
is
that
i
can
trust
you
to
fulfil
a
promise
moreover
you
are
my
next
of
kin
except
among
the
womankind
and
you
are
just
the
man
i
want
to
help
me
in
my
enterprise
and
i
will
help
you
sir
i
answered
fearing
some
conspiracy
in
anything
that
is
true
and
loyal
and
according
to
the
laws
of
the
realm
ha
ha
cried
the
old
man
laughing
until
his
eyes
ran
over
and
spreading
out
his
skinny
hands
upon
his
shining
breeches
thou
hast
gone
the
same
fools
track
as
the
rest
even
as
spy
stickles
went
and
all
his
precious
troopers
landing
of
arms
at
glenthorne
and
lynmouth
wagons
escorted
across
the
moor
sounds
of
metal
and
booming
noises
ah
but
we
managed
it
cleverly
to
cheat
even
those
so
near
to
us
disaffection
at
taunton
signs
of
insurrection
at
dulverton
revolutionary
tanner
at

we
set
it
all
abroad
right
well
and
not
even
you
to
suspect
our
work
though
we
thought
at
one
time
that
you
watched
us
now
who
do
you
suppose
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
exmoor

this
western
rebellionnot
that
i
say
there
is
none
mindbut
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
either
mother
melldrum
said
i
being
now
a
little
angry
or
else
old
nick
himself
nay
old
uncle
reuben
saying
this
master
huckaback
cast
back
his
coat
and
stood
up
and
made
the
most
of
himself
well
cried
i
being
now
quite
come
to
the
limits
of
my
intellect
then
after
all
captain
stickles
was
right
in
calling
you
a
rebel
sir
of
course
he
was
could
so
keen
a
man
be
wrong
about
an
old
fool
like
me
but
come
and
see
our
rebellion
john
i
will
trust
you
now
with
everything
i
will
take
no
oath
from
you
only
your
word
to
keep
silence
and
most
of
all
from
your
mother
i
will
give
you
my
word
i
said
although
liking
not
such
pledges
which
make
a
man
think
before
he
speaks
in
ordinary
company
against
his
usual
practices
however
i
was
now
so
curious
that
i
thought
of
nothing
else
and
scarcely
could
believe
at
all
that
uncle
ben
was
quite
right
in
his
head
take
another
glass
of
wine
my
son
he
cried
with
a
cheerful
countenance
which
made
him
look
more
than
ten
years
younger
you
shall
come
into
partnership
with
me
your
strength
will
save
us
two
horses
and
we
always
fear
the
horse
work
come
and
see
our
rebellion
my
boy
you
are
a
made
man
from
tonight
but
where
am
i
to
come
and
see
it
where
am
i
to
find
it
sir
meet
me
he
answered
yet
closing
his
hands
and
wrinkling
with
doubt
his
forehead
come
alone
of
course
and
meet
me
at
the
wizards
slough
at
ten
tomorrow
morning

lviii
master
huckabacks
secret
knowing
master
huckaback
to
be
a
man
of
his
word
as
well
as
one
who
would
have
others
so
i
was
careful
to
be
in
good
time
the
next
morning
by
the
side
of
the
wizards
slough
i
am
free
to
admit
that
the
name
of
the
place
bore
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
and
a
love
of
distance
in
some
measure
to
my
heart
but
i
did
my
best
not
to
think
of
this
only
i
thought
it
a
wise
precaution
and
due
for
the
sake
of
my
mother
and
lorna
to
load
my
gun
with
a
dozen
slugs
made
from
the
lead
of
the
old
churchporch
laid
by
long
since
against
witchcraft
i
am
well
aware
that
some
people
now
begin
to
doubt
about
witchcraft
or
at
any
rate
feign
to
do
so
being
desirous
to
disbelieve
whatever
they
are
afraid
of
this
spirit
is
growing
too
common
among
us
and
will
end
unless
we
put
a
stop
to
it
in
the
destruction
of
all
religion
and
as
regards
witchcraft
a
man
is
bound
either
to
believe
in
it
or
to
disbelieve
the
bible
for
even
in
the
new
testament
discarding
many
things
of
the
old
such
as
sacrifices
and
sabbath
and
fasting
and
other
miseries
witchcraft
is
clearly
spoken
of
as
a
thing
that
must
continue
that
the
evil
one
be
not
utterly
robbed
of
his
vested
interests
hence
let
no
one
tell
me
that
witchcraft
is
done
away
with
for
i
will
meet
him
with
st
paul
than
whom
no
better
man
and
few
less
superstitious
can
be
found
in
all
the
bible
feeling
these
things
more
in
those
days
than
i
feel
them
now
i
fetched
a
goodish
compass
round
by
the
way
of
the
cloven
rocks
rather
than
cross
black
barrow
down
in
a
reckless
and
unholy
manner
there
were
several
spots
upon
that
down
cursed
and
smitten
and
blasted
as
if
thunderbolts
had
fallen
there
and
satan
sat
to
keep
them
warm
at
any
rate
it
was
good
as
every
one
acknowledged
not
to
wander
there
too
much
even
with
a
doctor
of
divinity
on
one
arm
and
of
medicine
upon
the
other
therefore
i
being
all
alone
and
on
foot
as
seemed
the
wisest
preferred
a
course
of
roundabout
and
starting
about
eight
oclock
without
mentioning
my
business
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
deep
descent
such
as
john
fry
described
it
now
this
though
i
have
not
spoken
of
it
was
not
my
first
time
of
being
there
for
although
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
spy
upon
uncle
reuben
as
john
fry
had
done
yet
i
thought
it
no
ill
manners
after
he
had
left
our
house
to
have
a
look
at
the
famous
place
where
the
malefactor
came
to
life
at
least
in
johns
opinion
at
that
time
however
i
saw
nothing
except
the
great
ugly
black
morass
with
the
grisly
reeds
around
it
and
i
did
not
care
to
go
very
near
it
much
less
to
pry
on
the
further
side
now
on
the
other
hand
i
was
bent
to
get
at
the
very
bottom
of
this
mystery
if
there
were
any
having
less
fear
of
witch
or
wizard
with
a
man
of
uncle
reubens
wealth
to
take
my
part
and
see
me
through
so
i
rattled
the
ramrod
down
my
gun
just
to
know
if
the
charge
were
right
after
so
much
walking
and
finding
it
full
six
inches
deep
as
i
like
to
have
it
went
boldly
down
the
steep
gorge
of
rock
with
a
firm
resolve
to
shoot
any
witch
unless
it
were
good
mother
melldrum
nevertheless
to
my
surprise
all
was
quiet
and
fair
to
look
at
in
the
decline
of
the
narrow
way
with
great
stalked
ferns
coming
forth
like
trees
yet
hanging
like
cobwebs
over
one
and
along
one
side
a
little
spring
was
getting
rid
of
its
waters
any
man
might
stop
and
think
or
he
might
go
on
and
think
and
in
either
case
there
was
none
to
say
that
he
was
making
a
fool
of
himself
when
i
came
to
the
foot
of
this
ravine
and
over
against
the
great
black
slough
there
was
no
sign
of
master
huckaback
nor
of
any
other
living
man
except
myself
in
the
silence
therefore
i
sat
in
a
niche
of
rock
gazing
at
the
slough
and
pondering
the
old
tradition
about
it
they
say
that
in
the
ancient
times
a
mighty
necromancer
lived
in
the
wilderness
of
exmoor
here
by
spell
and
incantation
he
built
himself
a
strong
high
palace
eightsided
like
a
spiders
web
and
standing
on
a
central
steep
so
that
neither
man
nor
beast
could
cross
the
moors
without
his
knowledge
if
he
wished
to
rob
and
slay
a
traveller
or
to
have
wild
ox
or
stag
for
food
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
than
sit
at
one
of
his
eight
windows
and
point
his
unholy
book
at
him
any
moving
creature
at
which
that
book
was
pointed
must
obey
the
call
and
come
from
whatever
distance
if
sighted
once
by
the
wizard
this
was
a
bad
condition
of
things
and
all
the
country
groaned
under
it
and
exmoor
although
the
most
honest
place
that
a
man
could
wish
to
live
in
was
beginning
to
get
a
bad
reputation
and
all
through
that
vile
wizard
no
man
durst
even
go
to
steal
a
sheep
or
a
pony
or
so
much
as
a
deer
for
dinner
lest
he
should
be
brought
to
book
by
a
far
bigger
rogue
than
he
was
and
this
went
on
for
many
years
though
they
prayed
to
god
to
abate
it
but
at
last
when
the
wizard
was
getting
fat
and
haughty
upon
his
high
stomach
a
mighty
deliverance
came
to
exmoor
and
a
warning
and
a
memory
for
one
day
the
sorcerer
gazed
from
his
window
facing
the
southeast
of
the
compass
and
he
yawned
having
killed
so
many
men
that
now
he
was
weary
of
it
ifackins
he
cried
or
some
such
oath
both
profane
and
uncomely
i
see
a
man
on
the
verge
of
the
skyline
going
along
laboriously
a
pilgrim
i
trow
or
some
such
fool
with
the
nails
of
his
boots
inside
them
too
thin
to
be
worth
eating
but
i
will
have
him
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
and
most
of
those
saints
have
got
money
with
these
words
he
stretched
forth
his
legs
on
a
stool
and
pointed
the
book
of
heathenish
spells
back
upwards
at
the
pilgrim
now
this
good
pilgrim
was
plodding
along
soberly
and
religiously
with
a
pound
of
flints
in
either
boot
and
not
an
ounce
of
meat
inside
him
he
felt
the
spell
of
the
wicked
book
but
only
as
a
horse
might
feel
a
geewug
addressed
to
him
it
was
in
the
power
of
this
good
man
either
to
go
on
or
turn
aside
and
see
out
the
wizards
meaning
and
for
a
moment
he
halted
and
stood
like
one
in
two
minds
about
a
thing
then
the
wizard
clapped
one
cover
to
in
a
jocular
and
insulting
manner
and
the
sound
of
it
came
to
the
pilgrims
ear
about
five
miles
in
the
distance
like
a
great
gun
fired
at
him
by
our
lady
he
cried
i
must
see
to
this
although
my
poor
feet
have
no
skin
below
them
i
will
teach
this
heathen
miscreant
how
to
scoff
at
glastonbury
thereupon
he
turned
his
course
and
ploughed
along
through
the
moors
and
bogs
towards
the
eightsided
palace
the
wizard
sat
on
his
chair
of
comfort
and
with
the
rankest
contempt
observed
the
holy
man
ploughing
towards
him
he
has
something
good
in
his
wallet
i
trow
said
the
black
thief
to
himself
these
fellows
get
always
the
pick
of
the
wine
and
the
best
of
a
womans
money
then
he
cried
come
in
come
in
good
sir
as
he
always
did
to
every
one
bad
sir
i
will
not
come
in
said
the
pilgrim
neither
shall
you
come
out
again
here
are
the
bones
of
all
you
have
slain
and
here
shall
your
own
bones
be
hurry
me
not
cried
the
sorcerer
that
is
a
thing
to
think
about
how
many
miles
hast
thou
travelled
this
day
but
the
pilgrim
was
too
wide
awake
for
if
he
had
spoken
of
any
number
bearing
no
cross
upon
it
the
necromancer
would
have
had
him
like
a
ball
at
bandoplay
therefore
he
answered
as
truly
as
need
be
by
the
grace
of
our
lady
nine
now
nine
is
the
crossest
of
all
cross
numbers
and
full
to
the
lip
of
all
crochets
so
the
wizard
staggered
back
and
thought
and
inquired
again
with
bravery
where
can
you
find
a
man
and
wife
one
going
uphill
and
one
going
down
and
not
a
word
spoken
between
them
in
a
cucumber
plant
said
the
modest
saint
blushing
even
to
think
of
it
and
the
wizard
knew
he
was
done
for
you
have
tried
me
with
ungodly
questions
continued
the
honest
pilgrim
with
one
hand
still
over
his
eyes
as
he
thought
of
the
feminine
cucumber
and
now
i
will
ask
you
a
pure
one
to
whom
of
mankind
have
you
ever
done
good
since
god
saw
fit
to
make
you
the
wizard
thought
but
could
quote
no
one
and
he
looked
at
the
saint
and
the
saint
at
him
and
both
their
hearts
were
trembling
can
you
mention
only
one
asked
the
saint
pointing
a
piece
of
the
true
cross
at
him
hoping
he
might
cling
to
it
even
a
little
child
will
do
try
to
think
of
some
one
the
earth
was
rocking
beneath
their
feet
and
the
palace
windows
darkened
on
them
with
a
tint
of
blood
for
now
the
saint
was
come
inside
hoping
to
save
the
wizard
if
i
must
tell
the
pure
truth
said
the
wizard
looking
up
at
the
arches
of
his
windows
i
can
tell
of
only
one
to
whom
i
ever
have
done
good
one
will
do
one
is
quite
enough
be
quick
before
the
ground
opens
the
name
of
oneand
this
cross
will
save
you
lay
your
thumb
on
the
end
of
it
nay
that
i
cannot
do
great
saint
the
devil
have
mercy
upon
me
all
this
while
the
palace
was
sinking
and
blackness
coming
over
them
thou
hast
all
but
done
for
thyself
said
the
saint
with
a
glory
burning
round
his
head
by
that
last
invocation
yet
give
us
the
name
of
the
one
my
friend
if
one
there
be
it
will
save
thee
with
the
cross
upon
thy
breast
all
is
crashing
round
us
dear
brother
who
is
that
one
my
own
self
cried
the
wretched
wizard
then
there
is
no
help
for
thee
and
with
that
the
honest
saint
went
upward
and
the
wizard
and
all
his
palace
and
even
the
crag
that
bore
it
sank
to
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
over
them
was
nothing
left
except
a
black
bog
fringed
with
reed
of
the
tint
of
the
wizards
whiskers
the
saint
however
was
all
right
after
sleeping
off
the
excitement
and
he
founded
a
chapel
some
three
miles
westward
and
there
he
lies
with
his
holy
relic
and
thither
in
after
ages
came
as
we
all
come
home
at
last
both
my
lornas
aunt
sabina
and
her
guardian
ensor
doone
while
yet
i
dwelled
upon
this
strange
story
wondering
if
it
all
were
true
and
why
such
things
do
not
happen
now
a
man
on
horseback
appeared
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
risen
out
of
the
earth
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
black
slough
at
first
i
was
a
little
scared
my
mind
being
in
the
tune
for
wonders
but
presently
the
white
hair
whiter
from
the
blackness
of
the
bog
between
us
showed
me
that
it
was
uncle
reuben
come
to
look
for
me
that
way
then
i
left
my
chair
of
rock
and
waved
my
hat
and
shouted
to
him
and
the
sound
of
my
voice
among
the
crags
and
lonely
corners
frightened
me
old
master
huckaback
made
no
answer
but
so
far
as
i
could
guess
beckoned
me
to
come
to
him
there
was
just
room
between
the
fringe
of
reed
and
the
belt
of
rock
around
it
for
a
man
going
very
carefully
to
escape
that
horrible
pithole
and
so
i
went
round
to
the
other
side
and
there
found
open
space
enough
with
stunted
bushes
and
starveling
trees
and
straggling
tufts
of
rushes
you
fool
you
are
frightened
said
uncle
ben
as
he
looked
at
my
face
after
shaking
hands
i
want
a
young
man
of
steadfast
courage
as
well
as
of
strength
and
silence
and
after
what
i
heard
of
the
battle
at
glen
doone
i
thought
i
might
trust
you
for
courage
so
you
may
said
i
wherever
i
see
mine
enemy
but
not
where
witch
and
wizard
be
tush
great
fool
cried
master
huckaback
the
only
witch
or
wizard
here
is
the
one
that
bewitcheth
all
men
now
fasten
up
my
horse
john
ridd
and
not
too
near
the
slough
lad
ah
we
have
chosen
our
entrance
wisely
two
good
horsemen
and
their
horses
coming
hither
to
spy
us
out
are
gone
mining
on
their
own
account
and
their
last
account
it
is
down
this
good
wizards
boghole
with
these
words
uncle
reuben
clutched
the
mane
of
his
horse
and
came
down
as
a
man
does
when
his
legs
are
old
and
as
i
myself
begin
to
do
at
this
time
of
writing
i
offered
a
hand
but
he
was
vexed
and
would
have
nought
to
do
with
it
now
follow
me
step
for
step
he
said
when
i
had
tethered
his
horse
to
a
tree
the
ground
is
not
death
like
the
wizards
hole
but
many
parts
are
treacherous
i
know
it
well
by
this
time
without
any
more
ado
he
led
me
in
and
out
the
marshy
places
to
a
great
round
hole
or
shaft
bratticed
up
with
timber
i
never
had
seen
the
like
before
and
wondered
how
they
could
want
a
well
with
so
much
water
on
every
side
around
the
mouth
were
a
few
little
heaps
of
stuff
unused
to
the
daylight
and
i
thought
at
once
of
the
tales
i
had
heard
concerning
mines
in
cornwall
and
the
silver
cup
at
combemartin
sent
to
the
queen
elizabeth
we
had
a
tree
across
it
john
said
uncle
reuben
smiling
grimly
at
my
sudden
shrink
from
it
but
some
rogue
came
spying
here
just
as
one
of
our
men
went
up
he
was
frightened
half
out
of
his
life
i
believe
and
never
ventured
to
come
again
but
we
put
the
blame
of
that
upon
you
and
i
see
that
we
were
wrong
john
here
he
looked
at
me
with
keen
eyes
though
weak
you
were
altogether
wrong
i
answered
am
i
mean
enough
to
spy
upon
any
one
dwelling
with
us
and
more
than
that
uncle
reuben
it
was
mean
of
you
to
suppose
it
all
ideas
are
different
replied
the
old
man
to
my
heat
like
a
little
wornout
rill
running
down
a
smithy
you
with
your
strength
and
youth
and
all
that
are
inclined
to
be
romantic
i
take
things
as
i
have
known
them
going
on
for
seventy
years
now
will
you
come
and
meet
the
wizard
or
does
your
courage
fail
you
my
courage
must
be
none
said
i
if
i
would
not
go
where
you
go
sir
he
said
no
more
but
signed
to
me
to
lift
a
heavy
wooden
corb
with
an
iron
loop
across
it
and
sunk
in
a
little
pit
of
earth
a
yard
or
so
from
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
i
raised
it
and
by
his
direction
dropped
it
into
the
throat
of
the
shaft
where
it
hung
and
shook
from
a
great
crossbeam
laid
at
the
level
of
the
earth
a
very
stout
thick
rope
was
fastened
to
the
handle
of
the
corb
and
ran
across
a
pulley
hanging
from
the
centre
of
the
beam
and
thence
out
of
sight
in
the
nether
places
i
will
first
descend
he
said
your
weight
is
too
great
for
safety
when
the
bucket
comes
up
again
follow
me
if
your
heart
is
good
then
he
whistled
down
with
a
quick
sharp
noise
and
a
whistle
from
below
replied
and
he
clomb
into
the
vehicle
and
the
rope
ran
through
the
pulley
and
uncle
ben
went
merrily
down
and
was
out
of
sight
before
i
had
time
to
think
of
him
now
being
left
on
the
bank
like
that
and
in
full
sight
of
the
goodly
heaven
i
wrestled
hard
with
my
flesh
and
blood
about
going
down
into
the
pithole
and
but
for
the
pale
shame
of
the
thing
that
a
whiteheaded
man
should
adventure
so
and
green
youth
doubt
about
it
never
could
i
have
made
up
my
mind
for
i
do
love
air
and
heaven
however
at
last
up
came
the
bucket
and
with
a
short
sad
prayer
i
went
into
whatever
might
happen
my
teeth
would
chatter
do
all
i
could
but
the
strength
of
my
arms
was
with
me
and
by
them
i
held
on
the
grimy
rope
and
so
eased
the
foot
of
the
corb
which
threatened
to
go
away
fathoms
under
me
of
course
i
should
still
have
been
safe
enough
being
like
an
egg
in
an
eggcup
too
big
to
care
for
the
bottom
still
i
wished
that
all
should
be
done
in
good
order
without
excitement
the
scoopings
of
the
side
grew
black
and
the
patch
of
sky
above
more
blue
as
with
many
thoughts
of
lorna
a
long
way
underground
i
sank
then
i
was
fetched
up
at
the
bottom
with
a
jerk
and
rattle
and
but
for
holding
by
the
rope
so
must
have
tumbled
over
two
great
torches
of
baleresin
showed
me
all
the
darkness
one
being
held
by
uncle
ben
and
the
other
by
a
short
square
man
with
a
face
which
seemed
wellknown
to
me
hail
to
the
world
of
gold
john
ridd
said
master
huckaback
smiling
in
the
old
dry
manner
bigger
coward
never
came
down
the
shaft
now
did
he
carfax
they
be
all
alike
said
the
short
square
man
fust
time
as
they
doos
it
may
i
go
to
heaven
i
cried
which
is
a
thing
quite
out
of
sightfor
i
always
have
a
vein
of
humour
too
small
to
be
followed
by
any
oneif
ever
again
of
my
own
accord
i
go
so
far
away
from
it
uncle
ben
grinned
less
at
this
than
at
the
way
i
knocked
my
shin
in
getting
out
of
the
bucket
and
as
for
master
carfax
he
would
not
even
deign
to
smile
and
he
seemed
to
look
upon
my
entrance
as
an
interloping
for
my
part
i
had
nought
to
do
after
rubbing
my
bruised
leg
except
to
look
about
me
so
far
as
the
dullness
of
light
would
help
and
herein
i
seemed
like
a
mouse
in
a
trap
able
no
more
than
to
run
to
and
fro
and
knock
himself
and
stare
at
things
for
here
was
a
little
channel
grooved
with
posts
on
either
side
of
it
and
ending
with
a
heap
of
darkness
whence
the
sight
came
back
again
and
there
was
a
scooped
place
like
a
funnel
but
pouring
only
to
darkness
so
i
waited
for
somebody
to
speak
first
not
seeing
my
way
to
anything
you
seem
to
be
disappointed
john
said
uncle
reuben
looking
blue
by
the
light
of
the
flambeaux
did
you
expect
to
see
the
roof
of
gold
and
the
sides
of
gold
and
the
floor
of
gold
john
ridd
ha
ha
cried
master
carfax
i
reckon
her
did
no
doubt
her
did
you
are
wrong
i
replied
but
i
did
expect
to
see
something
better
than
dirt
and
darkness
come
on
then
my
lad
and
we
will
show
you
something
better
we
want
your
great
arm
on
here
for
a
job
that
has
beaten
the
whole
of
us
with
these
words
uncle
ben
led
the
way
along
a
narrow
passage
roofed
with
rock
and
floored
with
slatecoloured
shale
and
shingle
and
winding
in
and
out
until
we
stopped
at
a
great
stone
block
or
boulder
lying
across
the
floor
and
as
large
as
my
mothers
best
oaken
wardrobe
beside
it
were
several
sledgehammers
battered
and
some
with
broken
helves
thou
great
villain
cried
uncle
ben
giving
the
boulder
a
little
kick
i
believe
thy
time
is
come
at
last
now
john
give
us
a
sample
of
the
things
they
tell
of
thee
take
the
biggest
of
them
sledgehammers
and
crack
this
rogue
in
two
for
us
we
have
tried
at
him
for
a
fortnight
and
he
is
a
nut
worth
cracking
but
we
have
no
man
who
can
swing
that
hammer
though
all
in
the
mine
have
handled
it
i
will
do
my
very
best
said
i
pulling
off
my
coat
and
waistcoat
as
if
i
were
going
to
wrestle
but
i
fear
he
will
prove
too
tough
for
me
ay
that
her
wull
grunted
master
carfax
lackth
a
carnishman
and
a
beg
one
too
not
a
little
charp
such
as
i
be
there
be
no
man
outside
carnwall
as
can
crack
that
boolder
bless
my
heart
i
answered
but
i
know
something
of
you
my
friend
or
at
any
rate
of
your
family
well
i
have
beaten
most
of
your
cornish
men
though
not
my
place
to
talk
of
it
but
mind
if
i
crack
this
rock
for
you
i
must
have
some
of
the
gold
inside
it
dost
think
to
see
the
gold
come
tumbling
out
like
the
kernel
of
a
nut
thou
zany
asked
uncle
reuben
pettishly
now
wilt
thou
crack
it
or
wilt
thou
not
for
i
believe
thou
canst
do
it
though
only
a
lad
of
somerset
uncle
reuben
showed
by
saying
this
and
by
his
glance
at
carfax
that
he
was
proud
of
his
county
and
would
be
disappointed
for
it
if
i
failed
to
crack
the
boulder
so
i
begged
him
to
stoop
his
torch
a
little
that
i
might
examine
my
subject
to
me
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
at
all
remarkable
about
it
except
that
it
sparkled
here
and
there
when
the
flash
of
the
flame
fell
upon
it
a
great
obstinate
oblong
sullen
stone
how
could
it
be
worth
the
breaking
except
for
making
roads
with
nevertheless
i
took
up
the
hammer
and
swinging
it
far
behind
my
head
fetched
it
down
with
all
my
power
upon
the
middle
of
the
rock
the
roof
above
rang
mightily
and
the
echo
went
down
delven
galleries
so
that
all
the
miners
flocked
to
know
what
might
be
doing
but
master
carfax
only
smiled
although
the
blow
shook
him
where
he
stood
for
behold
the
stone
was
still
unbroken
and
as
firm
as
ever
then
i
smote
it
again
with
no
better
fortune
and
uncle
ben
looked
vexed
and
angry
but
all
the
miners
grinned
with
triumph
this
little
tool
is
too
light
i
cried
one
of
you
give
me
a
piece
of
strong
cord
then
i
took
two
more
of
the
weightiest
hammers
and
lashed
them
fast
to
the
back
of
mine
not
so
as
to
strike
but
to
burden
the
fall
having
made
this
firm
and
with
room
to
grasp
the
handle
of
the
largest
one
onlyfor
the
helves
of
the
others
were
shorteri
smiled
at
uncle
ben
and
whirled
the
mighty
implement
round
my
head
just
to
try
whether
i
could
manage
it
upon
that
the
miners
gave
a
cheer
being
honest
men
and
desirous
of
seeing
fair
play
between
this
shameless
stone
as
dan
homer
calls
it
and
me
with
my
hammer
hammering
then
i
swung
me
on
high
to
the
swing
of
the
sledge
as
a
thresher
bends
back
to
the
rise
of
his
flail
and
with
all
my
power
descending
delivered
the
ponderous
onset
crashing
and
crushed
the
great
stone
fell
over
and
threads
of
sparkling
gold
appeared
in
the
jagged
sides
of
the
breakage
how
now
simon
carfax
cried
uncle
ben
triumphantly
wilt
thou
find
a
man
in
cornwall
can
do
the
like
of
that
ay
and
more
he
answered
however
it
be
pretty
fair
for
a
lad
of
these
outlandish
parts
get
your
rollers
my
lads
and
lead
it
to
the
crushing
engine
i
was
glad
to
have
been
of
some
service
to
them
for
it
seems
that
this
great
boulder
had
been
too
large
to
be
drawn
along
the
gallery
and
too
hard
to
crack
but
now
they
moved
it
very
easily
taking
piece
by
piece
and
carefully
picking
up
the
fragments
thou
hast
done
us
a
good
turn
my
lad
said
uncle
reuben
as
the
others
passed
out
of
sight
at
the
corner
and
now
i
will
show
thee
the
bottom
of
a
very
wondrous
mystery
but
we
must
not
do
it
more
than
once
for
the
time
of
day
is
the
wrong
one
the
whole
affair
being
a
mystery
to
me
and
far
beyond
my
understanding
i
followed
him
softly
without
a
word
yet
thinking
very
heavily
and
longing
to
be
above
ground
again
he
led
me
through
small
passages
to
a
hollow
place
near
the
descending
shaft
where
i
saw
a
most
extraordinary
monster
fitted
up
in
form
it
was
like
a
great
coffeemill
such
as
i
had
seen
in
london
only
a
thousand
times
larger
and
with
heavy
windlass
to
work
it
put
in
a
barrowload
of
the
smoulder
said
uncle
ben
to
carfax
and
let
them
work
the
crank
for
john
to
understand
a
thing
or
two
at
this
time
of
day
cried
simon
carfax
and
the
watching
as
has
been
o
late
however
he
did
it
without
more
remonstrance
pouring
into
the
scuttle
at
the
top
of
the
machine
about
a
baskeful
of
broken
rock
and
then
a
dozen
men
went
to
the
wheel
and
forced
it
round
as
sailors
do
upon
that
such
a
hideous
noise
arose
as
i
never
should
have
believed
any
creature
capable
of
making
and
i
ran
to
the
well
of
the
mine
for
air
and
to
ease
my
ears
if
possible
enough
enough
shouted
uncle
ben
by
the
time
i
was
nearly
deafened
we
will
digest
our
goodly
boulder
after
the
devil
is
come
abroad
for
his
evening
work
now
john
not
a
word
about
what
you
have
learned
but
henceforth
you
will
not
be
frightened
by
the
noise
we
make
at
dusk
i
could
not
deny
but
what
this
was
very
clever
management
if
they
could
not
keep
the
echoes
of
the
upper
air
from
moving
the
wisest
plan
was
to
open
their
valves
during
the
discouragement
of
the
falling
evening
when
folk
would
rather
be
driven
away
than
drawn
into
the
wilds
and
quagmires
by
a
sound
so
deep
and
awful
coming
through
the
darkness
chapter
lix
lorna
gone
away
although
there
are
very
ancient
tales
of
gold
being
found
upon
exmoor
in
lumps
and
solid
hummocks
and
of
men
who
slew
one
another
for
it
this
deep
digging
and
great
labour
seemed
to
me
a
dangerous
and
unholy
enterprise
and
master
huckaback
confessed
that
up
to
the
present
time
his
two
partners
and
himself
for
they
proved
to
be
three
adventurers
had
put
into
the
earth
more
gold
than
they
had
taken
out
of
it
nevertheless
he
felt
quite
sure
that
it
must
in
a
very
short
time
succeed
and
pay
them
back
an
hundredfold
and
he
pressed
me
with
great
earnestness
to
join
them
and
work
there
as
much
as
i
could
without
moving
my
mothers
suspicions
i
asked
him
how
they
had
managed
so
long
to
carry
on
without
discovery
and
he
said
that
this
was
partly
through
the
wildness
of
the
neighbourhood
and
the
legends
that
frightened
people
of
a
superstitious
turn
partly
through
their
own
great
caution
and
the
manner
of
fetching
both
supplies
and
implements
by
night
but
most
of
all
they
had
to
thank
the
troubles
of
the
period
the
suspicions
of
rebellion
and
the
terror
of
the
doones
which
like
the
wizard
i
was
speaking
of
kept
folk
from
being
too
inquisitive
where
they
had
no
business
the
slough
moreover
had
helped
them
well
both
by
making
their
access
dark
and
yet
more
by
swallowing
up
and
concealing
all
that
was
cast
from
the
mouth
of
the
pit
once
before
the
attack
on
glen
doone
they
had
a
narrow
escape
from
the
kings
commissioner
for
captain
stickles
having
heard
no
doubt
the
story
of
john
fry
went
with
half
a
dozen
troopers
on
purpose
to
search
the
neighbourhood
now
if
he
had
ridden
alone
most
likely
he
would
have
discovered
everything
but
he
feared
to
venture
so
having
suspicion
of
a
trap
coming
as
they
did
in
a
company
all
mounted
and
conspicuous
the
watchman
who
was
posted
now
on
the
top
of
the
hill
almost
every
day
since
john
frys
appearance
could
not
help
espying
them
miles
distant
over
the
moorland
he
watched
them
under
the
shade
of
his
hand
and
presently
ran
down
the
hill
and
raised
a
great
commotion
then
simon
carfax
and
all
his
men
came
up
and
made
things
natural
removing
every
sign
of
work
and
finally
sinking
underground
drew
across
the
mouth
of
the
pit
a
hurdle
thatched
with
sedge
and
heather
only
simon
himself
was
left
behind
ensconced
in
a
hole
of
the
crags
to
observe
the
doings
of
the
enemy
captain
stickles
rode
very
bravely
with
all
his
men
clattering
after
him
down
the
rocky
pass
and
even
to
the
margin
of
the
slough
and
there
they
stopped
and
held
council
for
it
was
a
perilous
thing
to
risk
the
passage
upon
horseback
between
the
treacherous
brink
and
the
cliff
unless
one
knew
it
thoroughly
stickles
however
and
one
follower
carefully
felt
the
way
along
having
their
horses
well
in
hand
and
bearing
a
rope
to
draw
them
out
in
case
of
being
foundered
then
they
spurred
across
the
rough
boggy
land
farther
away
than
the
shaft
was
here
the
ground
lay
jagged
and
shaggy
wrought
up
with
high
tufts
of
reed
or
scragged
with
stunted
brushwood
and
between
the
ups
and
downs
which
met
anybody
anyhow
greencovered
places
tempted
the
foot
and
black
bogholes
discouraged
it
it
is
not
to
be
marvelled
at
that
amid
such
place
as
this
for
the
first
time
visited
the
horses
were
a
little
skeary
and
their
riders
partook
of
the
feeling
as
all
good
riders
do
in
and
out
of
the
tufts
they
went
with
their
eyes
dilating
wishing
to
be
out
of
harm
if
conscience
were
but
satisfied
and
of
this
tufty
flaggy
ground
pocked
with
bogs
and
boglets
one
especial
nature
is
that
it
will
not
hold
impressions
seeing
thus
no
track
of
men
nor
anything
but
marshwork
and
stormwork
and
of
the
seasons
these
two
honest
men
rode
back
and
were
glad
to
do
so
for
above
them
hung
the
mountains
cowled
with
fog
and
seamed
with
storm
and
around
them
desolation
and
below
their
feet
the
grave
hence
they
went
with
all
goodwill
and
vowed
for
ever
afterwards
that
fear
of
a
simple
place
like
that
was
only
too
ridiculous
so
they
all
rode
home
with
mutual
praises
and
their
courage
wellapproved
and
the
only
result
of
the
expedition
was
to
confirm
john
frys
repute
as
a
bigger
liar
than
ever
now
i
had
enough
of
that
underground
work
as
before
related
to
last
me
for
a
year
to
come
neither
would
i
for
sake
of
gold
have
ever
stepped
into
that
bucket
of
my
own
goodwill
again
but
when
i
told
lornawhom
i
could
trust
in
any
matter
of
secrecy
as
if
she
had
never
been
a
womanall
about
my
great
descent
and
the
honeycombing
of
the
earth
and
the
mournful
noise
at
eventide
when
the
gold
was
under
the
crusher
and
bewailing
the
mischief
it
must
do
then
lornas
chief
desire
was
to
know
more
about
simon
carfax
it
must
be
our
gwennys
father
she
cried
the
man
who
disappeared
underground
and
whom
she
has
ever
been
seeking
how
grieved
the
poor
little
thing
will
be
if
it
should
turn
out
after
all
that
he
left
his
child
on
purpose
i
can
hardly
believe
it
can
you
john
well
i
replied
all
men
are
wicked
more
or
less
to
some
extent
and
no
man
may
say
otherwise
for
i
did
not
wish
to
commit
myself
to
an
opinion
about
simon
lest
i
might
be
wrong
and
lorna
think
less
of
my
judgment
but
being
resolved
to
see
this
out
and
do
a
good
turn
if
i
could
to
gwenny
who
had
done
me
many
a
good
one
i
begged
my
lorna
to
say
not
a
word
of
this
matter
to
the
handmaiden
until
i
had
further
searched
it
out
and
to
carry
out
this
resolve
i
went
again
to
the
place
of
business
where
they
were
grinding
gold
as
freely
as
an
apothecary
at
his
pills
having
now
true
right
of
entrance
and
being
known
to
the
watchman
and
regarded
since
i
cracked
the
boulder
as
one
who
could
pay
his
footing
and
perhaps
would
be
the
master
when
uncle
ben
should
be
choked
with
money
i
found
the
corb
sent
up
for
me
rather
sooner
than
i
wished
it
for
the
smell
of
the
places
underground
and
the
way
mens
eyes
came
out
of
them
with
links
and
brands
and
flambeaux
instead
of
gods
light
to
look
at
were
to
me
a
point
of
caution
rather
than
of
pleasure
no
doubt
but
what
some
men
enjoy
it
being
born
like
worms
to
dig
and
to
live
in
their
own
scoopings
yet
even
the
worms
come
up
sometimes
after
a
good
soft
shower
of
rain
and
hold
discourse
with
one
another
whereas
these
men
and
the
horses
let
down
come
above
ground
never
and
the
changing
of
the
sky
is
half
the
change
our
nature
calls
for
earth
we
have
and
all
its
produce
moving
from
the
first
appearance
and
the
hope
with
infants
eyes
through
the
bloom
of
beautys
promise
to
the
rich
and
ripe
fulfilment
and
the
falling
back
to
rest
sea
we
have
with
all
its
wonder
shed
on
eyes
and
ears
and
heart
and
the
thought
of
something
morebut
without
the
sky
to
look
at
what
would
earth
and
sea
and
even
our
own
selves
be
to
us
do
we
look
at
earth
with
hope
yes
for
victuals
only
do
we
look
at
sea
with
hope
yes
that
we
may
escape
it
at
the
sky
alone
though
questioned
with
the
doubts
of
sunshine
or
scattered
with
uncertain
stars
at
the
sky
alone
we
look
with
pure
hope
and
with
memory
hence
it
always
hurt
my
feelings
when
i
got
into
that
bucket
with
my
smallclothes
turned
up
over
and
a
kerchief
round
my
hat
but
knowing
that
my
purpose
was
sound
and
my
motives
pure
i
let
the
sky
grow
to
a
little
blue
hole
and
then
to
nothing
over
me
at
the
bottom
master
carfax
met
me
being
captain
of
the
mine
and
desirous
to
know
my
business
he
wore
a
loose
sack
round
his
shoulders
and
his
beard
was
two
feet
long
my
business
is
to
speak
with
you
i
answered
rather
sternly
for
this
man
who
was
nothing
more
than
uncle
reubens
servant
had
carried
things
too
far
with
me
showing
no
respect
whatever
and
though
i
did
not
care
for
much
i
liked
to
receive
a
little
even
in
my
early
days
coom
into
the
muckhole
then
was
his
gracious
answer
and
he
led
me
into
a
filthy
cell
where
the
miners
changed
their
jackets
simon
carfax
i
began
with
a
manner
to
discourage
him
i
fear
you
are
a
shallow
fellow
and
not
worth
my
trouble
then
dont
take
it
he
replied
i
want
no
mans
trouble
for
your
sake
i
would
not
i
answered
but
for
your
daughters
sake
i
will
the
daughter
whom
you
left
to
starve
so
pitifully
in
the
wilderness
the
man
stared
at
me
with
his
pale
gray
eyes
whose
colour
was
lost
from
candle
light
and
his
voice
as
well
as
his
body
shook
while
he
cried
it
is
a
lie
man
no
daughter
and
no
son
have
i
nor
was
ever
child
of
mine
left
to
starve
in
the
wilderness
you
are
too
big
for
me
to
tackle
and
that
makes
you
a
coward
for
saying
it
his
hands
were
playing
with
a
pickaxe
helve
as
if
he
longed
to
have
me
under
it
perhaps
i
have
wronged
you
simon
i
answered
very
softly
for
the
sweat
upon
his
forehead
shone
in
the
smoky
torchlight
if
i
have
i
crave
your
pardon
but
did
you
not
bring
up
from
cornwall
a
little
maid
named
gwenny
and
supposed
to
be
your
daughter
ay
and
she
was
my
daughter
my
last
and
only
child
of
five
and
for
her
i
would
give
this
mine
and
all
the
gold
will
ever
come
from
it
you
shall
have
her
without
either
mine
or
gold
if
you
only
prove
to
me
that
you
did
not
abandon
her
abandon
her
i
abandon
gwenny
he
cried
with
such
a
rage
of
scorn
that
i
at
once
believed
him
they
told
me
she
was
dead
and
crushed
and
buried
in
the
drift
here
and
half
my
heart
died
with
her
the
almighty
blast
their
miningwork
if
the
scoundrels
lied
to
me
the
scoundrels
must
have
lied
to
you
i
answered
with
a
spirit
fired
by
his
heat
of
fury
the
maid
is
living
and
with
us
come
up
and
you
shall
see
her
rig
the
bucket
he
shouted
out
along
the
echoing
gallery
and
then
he
fell
against
the
wall
and
through
the
grimy
sack
i
saw
the
heaving
of
his
breast
as
i
have
seen
my
opponents
chest
in
a
long
hard
bout
of
wrestling
for
my
part
i
could
do
no
more
than
hold
my
tongue
and
look
at
him
without
another
word
we
rose
to
the
level
of
the
moors
and
mires
neither
would
master
carfax
speak
as
i
led
him
across
the
barrows
in
this
he
was
welcome
to
his
own
way
for
i
do
love
silence
so
little
harm
can
come
of
it
and
though
gwenny
was
no
beauty
her
father
might
be
fond
of
her
so
i
put
him
in
the
cowhouse
not
to
frighten
the
little
maid
and
the
folding
shutters
over
him
such
as
we
used
at
the
beestings
and
he
listened
to
my
voice
outside
and
held
on
and
preserved
himself
for
now
he
would
have
scooped
the
earth
as
cattle
do
at
yearningtime
and
as
meekly
and
as
patiently
to
have
his
child
restored
to
him
not
to
make
long
tale
of
itfor
this
thing
is
beyond
me
through
want
of
true
experiencei
went
and
fetched
his
gwenny
forth
from
the
back
kitchen
where
she
was
fighting
as
usual
with
our
betty
come
along
you
little
vick
i
said
for
so
we
called
her
i
have
a
message
to
you
gwenny
from
the
lord
in
heaven
dont
ee
talk
about
he
she
answered
her
have
long
forgatten
me
that
he
has
never
done
you
stupid
come
and
see
who
is
in
the
cowhouse
gwenny
knew
she
knew
in
a
moment
looking
into
my
eyes
she
knew
and
hanging
back
from
me
to
sigh
she
knew
it
even
better
she
had
not
much
elegance
of
emotion
being
flat
and
square
all
over
but
none
the
less
for
that
her
heart
came
quick
and
her
words
came
slowly
oh
jan
you
are
too
good
to
cheat
me
is
it
joke
you
are
putting
upon
me
i
answered
her
with
a
gaze
alone
and
she
tucked
up
her
clothes
and
followed
me
because
the
road
was
dirty
then
i
opened
the
door
just
wide
enough
for
the
child
to
to
go
her
father
and
left
those
two
to
have
it
out
as
might
be
most
natural
and
they
took
a
long
time
about
it
meanwhile
i
needs
must
go
and
tell
my
lorna
all
the
matter
and
her
joy
was
almost
as
great
as
if
she
herself
had
found
a
father
and
the
wonder
of
the
whole
was
this
that
i
got
all
the
credit
of
which
not
a
thousandth
part
belonged
by
right
and
reason
to
me
yet
so
it
almost
always
is
if
i
work
for
good
desert
and
slave
and
lie
awake
at
night
and
spend
my
unborn
life
in
dreams
not
a
blink
nor
wink
nor
inkling
of
my
labour
ever
tells
it
would
have
been
better
to
leave
unburned
and
to
keep
undevoured
the
fuel
and
the
food
of
life
but
if
i
have
laboured
not
only
acted
by
some
impulse
whim
caprice
or
anything
or
even
acting
not
at
all
only
letting
things
float
by
piled
upon
me
commendations
bravoes
and
applauses
almost
work
me
up
to
tempt
once
again
though
sick
of
it
the
ill
luck
of
deserving
without
intending
any
harm
and
meaning
only
good
indeed
i
had
now
done
serious
wrong
to
uncle
reubens
prospects
for
captain
carfax
was
full
as
angry
at
the
trick
played
on
him
as
he
was
happy
in
discovering
the
falsehood
and
the
fraud
of
it
nor
could
i
help
agreeing
with
him
when
he
told
me
all
of
it
as
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
did
and
ready
to
be
my
slave
henceforth
i
could
not
forbear
from
owning
that
it
was
a
low
and
heartless
trick
unworthy
of
men
who
had
families
and
the
recoil
whereof
was
well
deserved
whatever
it
might
end
in
for
when
this
poor
man
left
his
daughter
asleep
as
he
supposed
and
having
his
food
and
change
of
clothes
and
sunday
hat
to
see
to
he
meant
to
return
in
an
hour
or
so
and
settle
about
her
sustenance
in
some
house
of
the
neighbourhood
but
this
was
the
very
thing
of
all
things
which
the
leaders
of
the
enterprise
who
had
brought
him
up
from
cornwall
for
his
noted
skill
in
metals
were
determined
whether
by
fair
means
or
foul
to
stop
at
the
very
outset
secrecy
being
their
main
object
what
chance
could
there
be
of
it
if
the
miners
were
allowed
to
keep
their
children
in
the
neighbourhood
hence
on
the
plea
of
feasting
simon
they
kept
him
drunk
for
three
days
and
three
nights
assuring
him
whenever
he
had
gleams
enough
to
ask
for
her
that
his
daughter
was
as
well
as
could
be
and
enjoying
herself
with
the
children
not
wishing
the
maid
to
see
him
tipsy
he
pressed
the
matter
no
further
but
applied
himself
to
the
bottle
again
and
drank
her
health
with
pleasure
however
after
three
days
of
this
his
constitution
rose
against
it
and
he
became
quite
sober
with
a
certain
lowness
of
heart
moreover
and
a
sense
of
error
and
his
first
desire
to
right
himself
and
easiest
way
to
do
it
was
by
exerting
parental
authority
upon
gwenny
possessed
with
this
intention
for
he
was
not
a
sweet
tempered
man
and
his
head
was
aching
sadly
he
sought
for
gwenny
high
and
low
first
with
threats
and
then
with
fears
and
then
with
tears
and
wailing
and
so
he
became
to
the
other
men
a
warning
and
a
great
annoyance
therefore
they
combined
to
swear
what
seemed
a
very
likely
thing
and
might
be
true
for
all
they
knew
to
wit
that
gwenny
had
come
to
seek
for
her
father
down
the
shafthole
and
peering
too
eagerly
into
the
dark
had
toppled
forward
and
gone
down
and
lain
at
the
bottom
as
dead
as
a
stone
and
thou
being
so
happy
with
drink
the
villains
finished
up
to
him
and
getting
drunker
every
day
we
thought
it
shame
to
trouble
thee
and
we
buried
the
wench
in
the
lower
drift
and
no
use
to
think
more
of
her
but
come
and
have
a
glass
sim
but
simon
carfax
swore
that
drink
had
lost
him
his
wife
and
now
had
lost
him
the
last
of
his
five
children
and
would
lose
him
his
own
soul
if
further
he
went
on
with
it
and
from
that
day
to
his
death
he
never
touched
strong
drink
again
nor
only
this
but
being
soon
appointed
captain
of
the
mine
he
allowed
no
man
on
any
pretext
to
bring
cordials
thither
and
to
this
and
his
stern
hard
rule
and
stealthy
secret
management
as
much
as
to
good
luck
and
place
might
it
be
attributed
that
scarcely
any
but
themselves
had
dreamed
about
this
exmoor
mine
as
for
me
i
had
no
ambition
to
become
a
miner
and
the
state
to
which
goldseeking
had
brought
poor
uncle
ben
was
not
at
all
encouraging
my
business
was
to
till
the
ground
and
tend
the
growth
that
came
of
it
and
store
the
fruit
in
heavens
good
time
rather
than
to
scoop
and
burrow
like
a
weasel
or
a
rat
for
the
yellow
root
of
evil
moreover
i
was
led
from
home
between
the
hay
and
corn
harvests
when
we
often
have
a
week
to
spare
by
a
call
there
was
no
resisting
unless
i
gave
up
all
regard
for
wrestling
and
for
my
county
now
here
many
persons
may
take
me
amiss
and
there
always
has
been
some
confusion
which
people
who
ought
to
have
known
better
have
wrought
into
subject
of
quarrelling
by
birth
it
is
true
and
cannot
be
denied
that
i
am
a
man
of
somerset
nevertheless
by
breed
i
am
as
well
as
by
education
a
son
of
devon
also
and
just
as
both
of
our
two
counties
vowed
that
glen
doone
was
none
of
theirs
but
belonged
to
the
other
one
so
now
each
with
hot
claim
and
jangling
leading
even
to
blows
sometimes
asserted
and
would
swear
to
it
as
i
became
more
famous
that
john
ridd
was
of
its
own
producing
bred
of
its
own
true
blood
and
basely
stolen
by
the
other
now
i
have
not
judged
it
in
any
way
needful
or
even
becoming
and
delicate
to
enter
into
my
wrestling
adventures
or
describe
my
progress
the
whole
thing
is
so
different
from
lorna
and
her
gentle
manners
and
her
style
of
walking
moreover
i
must
seem
even
to
kind
people
to
magnify
myself
so
much
or
at
least
attempt
to
do
it
that
i
have
scratched
out
written
pages
through
my
better
taste
and
sense
neither
will
i
upon
this
head
make
any
difference
even
now
being
simply
betrayed
into
mentioning
the
matter
because
bare
truth
requires
it
in
the
tale
of
lornas
fortunes
for
a
mighty
giant
had
arisen
in
a
part
of
cornwall
and
his
calf
was
twentyfive
inches
round
and
the
breadth
of
his
shoulders
two
feet
and
a
quarter
and
his
stature
seven
feet
and
threequarters
round
the
chest
he
was
seventy
inches
and
his
hand
a
foot
across
and
there
were
no
scales
strong
enough
to
judge
of
his
weight
in
the
marketplace
now
this
manor
i
should
say
his
backers
and
his
boasters
for
the
giant
himself
was
modestsent
me
a
brave
and
haughty
challenge
to
meet
him
in
the
ring
at
bodmintown
on
the
first
day
of
august
or
else
to
return
my
champions
belt
to
them
by
the
messenger
it
is
no
use
to
deny
but
that
i
was
greatly
dashed
and
scared
at
first
for
my
part
i
was
only
when
measured
without
clothes
on
sixty
inches
round
the
breast
and
round
the
calf
scarce
twentyone
only
two
feet
across
the
shoulders
and
in
height
not
six
and
threequarters
however
my
mother
would
never
believe
that
this
man
could
beat
me
and
lorna
being
of
the
same
mind
i
resolved
to
go
and
try
him
as
they
would
pay
all
expenses
and
a
hundred
pounds
if
i
conquered
him
so
confident
were
those
cornishmen
now
this
story
is
too
well
known
for
me
to
go
through
it
again
and
again
every
child
in
devonshire
knows
and
his
grandson
will
know
the
song
which
some
clever
man
made
of
it
after
i
had
treated
him
to
water
and
to
lemon
and
a
little
sugar
and
a
drop
of
eaudevie
enough
that
i
had
found
the
giant
quite
as
big
as
they
had
described
him
and
enough
to
terrify
any
one
but
trusting
in
my
practice
and
study
of
the
art
i
resolved
to
try
a
back
with
him
and
when
my
arms
were
round
him
once
the
giant
was
but
a
farthingale
put
into
the
vice
of
a
blacksmith
the
man
had
no
bones
his
frame
sank
in
and
i
was
afraid
of
crushing
him
he
lay
on
his
back
and
smiled
at
me
and
i
begged
his
pardon
now
this
affair
made
a
noise
at
the
time
and
redounded
so
much
to
my
credit
that
i
was
deeply
grieved
at
it
because
deserving
none
for
i
do
like
a
good
strife
and
struggle
and
the
doubt
makes
the
joy
of
victory
whereas
in
this
case
i
might
as
well
have
been
sent
for
a
match
with
a
haymow
however
i
got
my
hundred
pounds
and
made
up
my
mind
to
spend
every
farthing
in
presents
for
mother
and
lorna
for
annie
was
married
by
this
time
and
long
before
i
went
away
as
need
scarcely
be
said
perhaps
if
any
one
follows
the
weeks
and
the
months
the
wedding
was
quiet
enough
except
for
everybodys
good
wishes
and
i
desire
not
to
dwell
upon
it
because
it
grieved
me
in
many
ways
but
now
that
i
had
tried
to
hope
the
very
best
for
dear
annie
a
deeper
blow
than
could
have
come
even
through
her
awaited
me
for
after
that
visit
to
cornwall
and
with
my
prizemoney
about
me
i
came
on
foot
from
okehampton
to
oare
so
as
to
save
a
little
sum
towards
my
time
of
marrying
for
lornas
fortune
i
would
not
have
small
or
great
i
would
not
have
it
only
if
there
were
no
denying
we
would
devote
the
whole
of
it
to
charitable
uses
as
master
peter
blundell
had
done
and
perhaps
the
future
ages
would
endeavour
to
be
grateful
lorna
and
i
had
settled
this
question
at
least
twice
a
day
on
the
average
and
each
time
with
more
satisfaction
now
coming
into
the
kitchen
with
all
my
cash
in
my
breeches
pocket
golden
guineas
with
an
elephant
on
them
for
the
stamp
of
the
guinea
company
i
found
dear
mother
most
heartily
glad
to
see
me
safe
and
sound
againfor
she
had
dreaded
that
giant
and
dreamed
of
himand
she
never
asked
me
about
the
money
lizzie
also
was
softer
and
more
gracious
than
usual
especially
when
she
saw
me
pour
guineas
like
peppercorns
into
the
puddingbasin
but
by
the
way
they
hung
about
i
knew
that
something
was
gone
wrong
where
is
lorna
i
asked
at
length
after
trying
not
to
ask
it
i
want
her
to
come
and
see
my
money
she
never
saw
so
much
before
alas
said
mother
with
a
heavy
sigh
she
will
see
a
great
deal
more
i
fear
and
a
deal
more
than
is
good
for
her
whether
you
ever
see
her
again
will
depend
upon
her
nature
john
what
do
you
mean
mother
have
you
quarrelled
why
does
not
lorna
come
to
me
am
i
never
to
know
now
john
be
not
so
impatient
my
mother
replied
quite
calmly
for
in
truth
she
was
jealous
of
lorna
you
could
wait
now
very
well
john
if
it
were
till
this
day
week
for
the
coming
of
your
mother
john
and
yet
your
mother
is
your
best
friend
who
can
ever
fill
her
place
thinking
of
her
future
absence
mother
turned
away
and
cried
and
the
boxiron
singed
the
blanket
now
said
i
being
wild
by
this
time
lizzie
you
have
a
little
sense
will
you
tell
me
where
is
lorna
the
lady
lorna
dugal
said
lizzie
screwing
up
her
lips
as
if
the
title
were
too
grand
is
gone
to
london
brother
john
and
not
likely
to
come
back
again
we
must
try
to
get
on
without
her
you
littlesomething
i
cried
which
i
dare
not
write
down
here
as
all
you
are
too
good
for
such
language
but
lizzies
lip
provoked
me
somy
lorna
gone
my
lorna
gone
and
without
goodbye
to
me
even
it
is
your
spite
has
sickened
her
you
are
quite
mistaken
there
she
replied
how
can
folk
of
low
degree
have
either
spite
or
liking
towards
the
people
so
far
above
them
the
lady
lorna
dugal
is
gone
because
she
could
not
help
herself
and
she
wept
enough
to
break
ten
heartsif
hearts
are
ever
broken
john
darling
lizzie
how
good
you
are
i
cried
without
noticing
her
sneer
tell
me
all
about
it
dear
tell
me
every
word
she
said
that
will
not
take
long
said
lizzie
quite
as
unmoved
by
soft
coaxing
as
by
urgent
cursing
the
lady
spoke
very
little
to
any
one
except
indeed
to
mother
and
to
gwenny
carfax
and
gwenny
is
gone
with
her
so
that
the
benefit
of
that
is
lost
but
she
left
a
letter
for
poor
john
as
in
charity
she
called
him
how
grand
she
looked
to
be
sure
with
the
fine
clothes
on
that
were
come
for
her
where
is
the
letter
you
utter
vixen
oh
may
you
have
a
husband
who
will
thresh
it
out
of
you
and
starve
it
and
swear
it
out
of
you
was
the
meaning
of
my
imprecation
but
lizzie
not
dreaming
as
yet
of
such
things
could
not
understand
me
and
was
rather
thankful
therefore
she
answered
quietly
the
letter
is
in
the
little
cupboard
near
the
head
of
lady
lornas
bed
where
she
used
to
keep
the
diamond
necklace
which
we
contrived
to
get
stolen
without
another
word
i
rushed
so
that
every
board
in
the
house
shook
up
to
my
lost
lornas
room
and
tore
the
little
wallniche
open
and
espied
my
treasure
it
was
as
simple
and
as
homely
and
loving
as
even
i
could
wish
part
of
it
ran
as
followsthe
other
parts
it
behoves
me
not
to
open
out
to
strangersmy
own
love
and
sometime
lordtake
it
not
amiss
of
me
that
even
without
farewell
i
go
for
i
cannot
persuade
the
men
to
wait
your
return
being
doubtful
my
greatuncle
some
grand
lord
is
awaiting
me
at
dunster
having
fear
of
venturing
too
near
this
exmoor
country
i
who
have
been
so
lawless
always
and
the
child
of
outlaws
am
now
to
atone
for
this
it
seems
by
living
in
a
court
of
law
and
under
special
surveillance
as
they
call
it
i
believe
of
his
majestys
court
of
chancery
my
uncle
is
appointed
my
guardian
and
master
and
i
must
live
beneath
his
care
until
i
am
twentyone
years
old
to
me
this
appears
a
dreadful
thing
and
very
unjust
and
cruel
for
why
should
i
lose
my
freedom
through
heritage
of
land
and
gold
i
offered
to
abandon
all
if
they
would
only
let
me
go
i
went
down
on
my
knees
to
them
and
said
i
wanted
titles
not
neither
land
nor
money
only
to
stay
where
i
was
where
first
i
had
known
happiness
but
they
only
laughed
and
called
me
child
and
said
i
must
talk
of
that
to
the
kings
high
chancellor
their
orders
they
had
and
must
obey
them
and
master
stickles
was
ordered
too
to
help
as
the
kings
commissioner
and
then
although
it
pierced
my
heart
not
to
say
one
goodbye
john
i
was
glad
upon
the
whole
that
you
were
not
here
to
dispute
it
for
i
am
almost
certain
that
you
would
not
without
force
to
yourself
have
let
your
lorna
go
to
people
who
never
never
can
care
for
her
here
my
darling
had
wept
again
by
the
tokens
on
the
paper
and
then
there
followed
some
sweet
words
too
sweet
for
me
to
chatter
them
but
she
finished
with
these
noble
lines
which
being
common
to
all
humanity
in
a
case
of
steadfast
love
i
do
no
harm
but
rather
help
all
true
love
by
repeating
of
one
thing
rest
you
well
assuredand
i
do
hope
that
it
may
prove
of

annie
luckier
than
john
some
people
may
look
down
upon
us
for
our
slavish
ways
as
they
may
choose
to
call
them
but
in
our
part
of
the
country
we
do
love
to
mention
title
and
to
roll
it
on
our
tongues
with
a
conscience
and
a
comfort
even
if
a
man
knows
not
through
fault
of
education
who
the
duke
of
this
is
or
the
earl
of
that
it
will
never
do
for
him
to
say
so
lest
the
room
look
down
on
him
therefore
he
must
nod
his
head
and
say
ah
to
be
sure
i
know
him
as
well
as
ever
i
know
my
own
good
womans
brother
he
married
lord
flipflaps
second
daughter
and
a
precious
life
she
led
him
whereupon
the
room
looks
up
at
him
but
i
being
quite
unable
to
carry
all
this
in
my
head
as
i
ought
was
speedily
put
down
by
people
of
a
noble
tendency
apt
at
lords
and
pat
with
dukes
and
knowing
more
about
the
king
than
his
majesty
would
have
requested
therefore
i
fell
back
in
thought
not
daring
in
words
to
do
so
upon
the
titles
of
our
horses
and
all
these
horses
deserved
their
names
not
having
merely
inherited
but
by
their
own
doing
earned
them
smiler
for
instance
had
been
so
called
not
so
much
from
a
habit
of
smiling
as
from
his
general
geniality
white
nose
and
white
ankle
this
worthy
horse
was
now
in
years
but
hale
and
gay
as
ever
and
when
you
let
him
out
of
the
stable
he
could
neigh
and
whinny
and
make
men
and
horses
know
it
on
the
other
hand
kickums
was
a
horse
of
morose
and
surly
order
harbouring
up
revenge
and
leading
a
rider
to
false
confidence
very
smoothly
he
would
go
and
as
gentle
as
a
turtledove
until
his
rider
fully
believed
that
a
packthread
was
enough
for
him
and
a
pat
of
approval
upon
his
neck
the
aim
and
crown
of
his
worthy
life
then
suddenly
up
went
his
hind
feet
to
heaven
and
the
rider
for
the
most
part
flew
over
his
nose
whereupon
good
kickums
would
take
advantage
of
his
favourable
position
to
come
and
bite
a
piece
out
of
his
back
now
in
my
present
state
of
mind
being
understood
of
nobody
having
none
to
bear
me
company
neither
wishing
to
have
any
an
indefinite
kind
of
attraction
drew
me
into
kickums
society
a
bond
of
mutual
sympathy
was
soon
established
between
us
i
would
ride
no
other
horse
neither
kickums
be
ridden
by
any
other
man
and
this
good
horse
became
as
jealous
about
me
as
a
dog
might
be
and
would
lash
out
or
run
teeth
foremost
at
any
one
who
came
near
him
when
i
was
on
his
back
this
season
the
reaping
of
the
corn
which
had
been
but
a
year
ago
so
pleasant
and
so
lightsome
was
become
a
heavy
labour
and
a
thing
for
grumbling
rather
than
for
gladness
however
for
the
sake
of
all
it
must
be
attended
to
and
with
as
fair
a
show
of
spirit
and
alacrity
as
might
be
for
otherwise
the
rest
would
drag
and
drop
their
hands
and
idle
being
quicker
to
take
infection
of
dullness
than
of
diligence
and
the
harvest
was
a
heavy
one
even
heavier
than
the
year
before
although
of
poorer
quality
therefore
was
i
forced
to
work
as
hard
as
any
horse
could
during
all
the
daylight
hours
and
defer
till
night
the
brooding
upon
my
misfortune
but
the
darkness
always
found
me
stiff
with
work
and
weary
and
less
able
to
think
than
to
dream
may
be
of
lorna
and
now
the
house
was
so
dull
and
lonesome
wanting
annies
pretty
presence
and
the
light
of
lornas
eyes
that
a
man
had
no
temptation
after
suppertime
even
to
sit
and
smoke
a
pipe
for
lizzie
though
so
learned
and
pleasant
when
it
suited
her
never
had
taken
very
kindly
to
my
love
for
lorna
and
being
of
a
proud
and
slightly
upstart
nature
could
not
bear
to
be
eclipsed
in
bearing
looks
and
breeding
and
even
in
clothes
by
the
stranger
for
one
thing
i
will
say
of
the
doones
that
whether
by
purchase
or
plunder
they
had
always
dressed
my
darling
well
with
her
own
sweet
taste
to
help
them
and
though
lizzies
natural
hate
of
the
maid
as
a
doone
and
burdened
with
fathers
death
should
have
been
changed
to
remorse
when
she
learned
of
lornas
real
parentage
it
was
only
altered
to
sullenness
and
discontent
with
herself
for
frequent
rudeness
to
an
innocent
person
and
one
of
such
high
descent
moreover
the
child
had
imbibed
strange
ideas
as
to
our
aristocracy
partly
perhaps
from
her
own
way
of
thinking
and
partly
from
reading
of
history
for
while
from
one
point
of
view
she
looked
up
at
them
very
demurely
as
commissioned
by
god
for
the
countrys
good
from
another
sight
she
disliked
them
as
ready
to
sacrifice
their
best
and
follow
their
worst
members
yet
why
should
this
wench
dare
to
judge
upon
a
matter
so
far
beyond
her
and
form
opinions
which
she
knew
better
than
declare
before
mother
but
with
me
she
had
no
such
scruple
for
i
had
no
authority
over
her
and
my
intellect
she
looked
down
upon
because
i
praised
her
own
so
thus
she
made
herself
very
unpleasant
to
me
by
little
jags
and
jerks
of
sneering
sped
as
though
unwittingly
which
i
who
now
considered
myself
allied
to
the
aristocracy
and
perhaps
took
airs
on
that
account
had
not
wit
enough
to
parry
yet
had
wound
enough
to
feel
now
any
one
who
does
not
know
exactly
how
mothers
feel
and
think
would
have
expected
my
mother
than
whom
could
be
no
better
one
to
pet
me
and
make
much
of
me
under
my
sad
trouble
to
hang
with
anxiety
on
my
looks
and
shed
her
tears
with
mine
if
any
and
season
every
dish
of
meat
put
by
for
her
johns
return
and
if
the
whole
truth
must
be
told
i
did
expect
that
sort
of
thing
and
thought
what
a
plague
it
would
be
to
me
yet
not
getting
it
was
vexed
as
if
by
some
new
injury
for
mother
was
a
special
creature
as
i
suppose
we
all
are
being
the
warmest
of
the
warm
when
fired
at
the
proper
corner
and
yet
if
taken
at
the
wrong
point
you
would
say
she
was
incombustible
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
i
had
no
one
even
to
speak
to
about
lorna
and
my
grievances
for
captain
stickles
was
now
gone
southward
and
john
fry
of
course
was
too
low
for
it
although
a
married
man
and
well
under
his
wifes
management
but
finding
myself
unable
at
last
to
bear
this
any
longer
upon
the
first
day
when
all
the
wheat
was
cut
and
the
stooks
set
up
in
every
field
yet
none
quite
fit
for
carrying
i
saddled
good
kickums
at
five
in
the
morning
and
without
a
word
to
mother
for
a
little
anxiety
might
do
her
good
off
i
set
for
molland
parish
to
have
the
counsel
and
the
comfort
of
my
darling
annie
the
horse
took
me
over
the
ground
so
fast
there
being
few
better
to
go
when
he
liked
that
by
nine
oclock
annie
was
in
my
arms
and
blushing
to
the
colour
of
winnies
cheeks
with
sudden
delight
and
young
happiness
you
precious
little
soul
i
cried
how
does
tom
behave
to
you
hush
said
annie
how
dare
you
ask
he
is
the
kindest
and
the
best
and
the
noblest
of
all
men
john
not
even
setting
yourself
aside
now
look
not
jealous
john
so
it
is
we
all
have
special
gifts
you
know
you
are
as
good
as
you
can
be
john
but
my
husbands
special
gift
is
nobility
of
character
here
she
looked
at
me
as
one
who
has
discovered
something
quite
unknown
i
am
devilish
glad
to
hear
it
said
i
being
touched
at
going
down
so
keep
him
to
that
mark
my
dear
and
cork
the
whisky
bottle
yes
darling
john
she
answered
quickly
not
desiring
to
open
that
subject
and
being
too
sweet
to
resent
it
and
how
is
lovely
lorna
what
an
age
it
is
since
i
have
seen
you
i
suppose
we
must
thank
her
for
that
you
may
thank
her
for
seeing
me
now
said
i
or
ratherseeing
how
hurt
she
lookedyou
may
thank
my
knowledge
of
your
kindness
and
my
desire
to
speak
of
her
to
a
softhearted
dear
little
soul
like
you
i
think
all
the
women
are
gone
mad
even
mother
treats
me
shamefully
and
as
for
lizzie
here
i
stopped
knowing
no
words
strong
enough
without
shocking
annie
do
you
mean
to
say
that
lorna
is
gone
asked
annie
in
great
amazement
yet
leaping
at
the
truth
as
women
do
with
nothing
at
all
to
leap
from
gone
and
i
never
shall
see
her
again
it
serves
me
right
for
aspiring
so
being
grieved
at
my
manner
she
led
me
in
where
none
could
interrupt
us
and
in
spite
of
all
my
dejection
i
could
not
help
noticing
how
very
pretty
and
even
elegant
all
things
were
around
for
we
upon
exmoor
have
little
taste
all
we
care
for
is
warm
comfort
and
plenty
to
eat
and
to
give
away
and
a
hearty
smack
in
everything
but
squire
faggus
had
seen
the
world
and
kept
company
with
great
people
and
the
taste
he
had
first
displayed
in
the
shoeing
of
farmers
horses
which
led
almost
to
his
ruin
by
bringing
him
into
jealousy
and
flattery
and
dashing
ways
had
now
been
cultivated
in
london
and
by
moonlight
so
that
none
could
help
admiring
it
well
i
cried
for
the
moment
dropping
care
and
woe
in
astonishment
we
have
nothing
like
this
at
plovers
barrows
nor
even
uncle
reuben
i
do
hope
it
is
honest
annie
would
i
sit
in
a
chair
that
was
not
my
own
asked
annie
turning
crimson
and
dropping
defiantly
and
with
a
whisk
of
her
dress
which
i
never
had
seen
before
into
the
very
grandest
one
would
i
lie
on
a
couch
brother
john
do
you
think
unless
good
money
was
paid
for
it
because
other
people
are
clever
john
you
need
not
grudge
them
their
earnings
a
couch
i
replied
why
what
can
you
want
with
a
couch
in
the
daytime
annie
a
couch
is
a
small
bed
set
up
in
a
room
without
space
for
a
good
fourposter
what
can
you
want
with
a
couch
downstairs
i
never
heard
of
such
nonsense
and
you
ought
to
be
in
the
dairy
i
wont
cry
brother
john
i
wont
because
you
want
to
make
me
cryand
all
the
time
she
was
cryingyou
always
were
so
nasty
john
sometimes
ah
you
have
no
nobility
of
character
like
my
husband
and
i
have
not
seen
you
for
two
months
john
and
now
you
come
to
scold
me
you
little
darling
i
said
for
annies
tears
always
conquered
me
if
all
the
rest
illuse
me
i
will
not
quarrel
with
you
dear
you
have
always
been
true
to
me
and
i
can
forgive
your
vanity
your
things
are
very
pretty
dear
and
you
may
couch
ten
times
a
day
without
my
interference
no
doubt
your
husband
has
paid
for
all
this
with
the
ponies
he
stole
from
exmoor
nobility
of
character
is
a
thing
beyond
my
understanding
but
when
my
sister
loves
a
man
and
he
does
well
and
flourishes
who
am
i
to
find
fault
with
him
mother
ought
to
see
these
things
they
would
turn
her
head
almost
look
at
the
pimples
on
the
chairs
they
are
nothing
annie
answered
after
kissing
me
for
my
kindness
they
are
only
put
in
for
the
time
indeed
and
we
are
to
have
much
better
with
gold
all
round
the
bindings
and
double
plush
at
the
corners
so
soon
as
ever
the
king
repays
the
debt
he
owes
to
my
poor
tom
i
thought
to
myself
that
our
present
king
had
been
most
unlucky
in
one
thingdebts
all
over
the
kingdom
not
a
man
who
had
struck
a
blow
for
the
king
or
for
his
poor
father
or
even
said
a
good
word
for
him
in
the
time
of
his
adversity
but
expected
at
least
a
baronetcy
and
a
grant
of
estates
to
support
it
many
have
called
king
charles
ungrateful
and
he
may
have
been
so
but
some
indulgence
is
due
to
a
man
with
entries
few
on
the
credit
side
and
a
terrible
column
of
debits
have
no
fear
for
the
chair
i
said
for
it
creaked
under
me
very
fearfully
having
legs
not
so
large
as
my
finger
if
the
chair
breaks
annie
your
fear
should
be
lest
the
tortoiseshell
run
into
me
why
it
is
striped
like
a
vipers
loins
i
saw
some
hundreds
in
london
and
very
cheap
they
are
they
are
made
to
be
sold
to
the
country
people
such
as
you
and
me
dear
and
carefully
kept
they
will
last
for
almost
half
a
year
now
will
you
come
back
from
your
furniture
and
listen
to
my
story
annie
was
a
hearty
dear
and
she
knew
that
half
my
talk
was
joke
to
make
light
of
my
worrying
therefore
she
took
it
in
good
part
as
i
well
knew
that
she
would
do
and
she
led
me
to
a
good
honest
chair
and
she
sat
in
my
lap
and
kissed
me
all
this
is
not
like
you
john
all
this
is
not
one
bit
like
you
and
your
cheeks
are
not
as
they
ought
to
be
i
shall
have
to
come
home
again
if
the
women
worry
my
brother
so
we
always
held
together
john
and
we
always
will
you
know
you
dear
i
cried
there
is
nobody
who
understands
me
as
you
do
lorna
makes
too
much
of
me
and
the
rest
they
make
too
little
not
mother
oh
not
mother
john
no
mother
makes
too
much
no
doubt
but
wants
it
all
for
herself
alone
and
reckons
it
as
a
part
of
her
she
makes
me
more
wroth
than
any
one
as
if
not
only
my
life
but
all
my
head
and
heart
must
seek
from
hers
and
have
no
other
thought
or
care
being
sped
of
my
grumbling
thus
and
eased
into
better
temper
i
told
annie
all
the
strange
history
about
lorna
and
her
departure
and
the
small
chance
that
now
remained
to
me
of
ever
seeing
my
love
again
to
this
annie
would
not
hearken
twice
but
judging
women
by
her
faithful
self
was
quite
vexed
with
me
for
speaking
so
and
then
to
my
surprise
and
sorrow
she
would
deliver
no
opinion
as
to
what
i
ought
to
do
until
she
had
consulted
darling
tom
dear
tom
knew
much
of
the
world
no
doubt
especially
the
dark
side
of
it
but
to
me
it
scarcely
seemed
becoming
that
my
course
of
action
with
regard
to
the
lady
lorna
dugal
should
be
referred
to
tom
faggus
and
depend
upon
his
decision
however
i
would
not
grieve
annie
again
by
making
light
of
her
husband
and
so
when
he
came
in
to
dinner
the
matter
was
laid
before
him
now
this
man
never
confessed
himself
surprised
under
any
circumstances
his
knowledge
of
life
being
so
profound
and
his
charity
universal
and
in
the
present
case
he
vowed
that
he
had
suspected
it
all
along
and
could
have
thrown
light
upon
lornas
history
if
we
had
seen
fit
to
apply
to
him
upon
further
inquiry
i
found
that
this
light
was
a
very
dim
one
flowing
only
from
the
fact
that
he
had
stopped
her
mothers
coach
at
the
village
of
bolham
on
the
bampton
road
the
day
before
i
saw
them
finding
only
women
therein
and
these
in
a
sad
condition
tom
with
his
usual
chivalry
as
he
had
no
scent
of
the
necklace
allowed
them
to
pass
with
nothing
more
than
a
pleasant
exchange
of
courtesies
and
a
testimonial
forced
upon
him
in
the
shape
of
a
bottle
of
burgundy
wine
this
the
poor
countess
handed
him
and
he
twisted
the
cork
out
with
his
teeth
and
drank
her
health
with
his
hat
off
a
lady
she
was
and
a
true
one
and
i
am
a
pretty
good
judge
said
tom
ah
i
do
like
a
high
lady
our
annie
looked
rather
queer
at
this
having
no
pretensions
to
be
one
but
she
conquered
herself
and
said
yes
tom
and
many
of
them
liked
you
with
this
tom
went
on
the
brag
at
once
being
but
a
shallow
fellow
and
not
of
settled
principles
though
steadier
than
he
used
to
be
until
i
felt
myself
almost
bound
to
fetch
him
back
a
little
for
of
all
things
i
do
hate
brag
the
most
as
any
reader
of
this
tale
must
by
this
time
know
therefore
i
said
to
squire
faggus
come
back
from
your
highway
days
you
have
married
the
daughter
of
an
honest
man
and
such
talk
is
not
fit
for
her
if
you
were
right
in
robbing
people
i
am
right
in
robbing
you
i
could
bind
you
to
your
own
mantelpiece
as
you
know
thoroughly
well
tom
and
drive
away
with
your
own
horses
and
all
your
goods
behind
them
but
for
the
sense
of
honesty
and
should
i
not
do
as
fine
a
thing
as
any
you
did
on
the
highway
if
everything
is
of
public
right
how
does
this
chair
belong
to
you
clever
as
you
are
tom
faggus
you
are
nothing
but
a
fool
to
mix
your
felony
with
your
farmership
drop
the
one
or
drop
the
other
you
cannot
maintain
them
both
as
i
finished
very
sternly
a
speech
which
had
exhausted
me
more
than
ten
rounds
of
wrestlingbut
i
was
carried
away
by
the
truth
as
sometimes
happens
to
all
of
ustom
had
not
a
word
to
say
albeit
his
mind
was
so
much
more
nimble
and
rapid
than
ever
mine
was
he
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
a
newlyinvented
affair
in
his
house
as
if
i
had
corded
him
to
it
even
as
i
spoke
of
doing
and
he
laid
one
hand
on
his
breast
in
a
way
which
made
annie
creep
softly
to
him
and
look
at
me
not
like
a
sister
you
have
done
me
good
john
he
said
at
last
and
the
hand
he
gave
me
was
trembling
there
is
no
other
man
on
gods
earth
would
have
dared
to
speak
to
me
as
you
have
done
from
no
other
would
i
have
taken
it
nevertheless
every
word
is
true
and
i
shall
dwell
on
it
when
you
are
gone
if
you
never
did
good
in
your
life
before
john
my
brother
you
have
done
it
now
he
turned
away
in
bitter
pain
that
none
might
see
his
trouble
and
annie
going
along
with
him
looked
as
if
i
had
killed
our
mother
for
my
part
i
was
so
upset
for
fear
of
having
gone
too
far
that
without
a
word
to
either
of
them
but
a
message
on
the
titlepage
of
king
james
his
prayerbook
i
saddled
kickums
and
was
off
and
glad
of
the
moorland
air
again
chapter
lxi
therefore
he
seeks
comfort
it
was
for
poor
annies
sake
that
i
had
spoken
my
mind
to
her
husband
so
freely
and
even
harshly
for
we
all
knew
she
would
break
her
heart
if
tom
took
to
evil
ways
again
and
the
right
mode
of
preventing
this
was
not
to
coax
and
flatter
and
make
a
hero
of
him
which
he
did
for
himself
quite
sufficiently
but
to
set
before
him
the
folly
of
the
thing
and
the
ruin
to
his
own
interests
they
would
both
be
vexed
with
me
of
course
for
having
left
them
so
hastily
and
especially
just
before
dinnertime
but
that
would
soon
wear
off
and
most
likely
they
would
come
to
see
mother
and
tell
her
that
i
was
hard
to
manage
and
they
could
feel
for
her
about
it
now
with
a
certain
yearning
i
know
not
what
for
softness
and
for
one
who
could
understand
mefor
simple
as
a
child
though
being
i
found
few
to
do
that
last
at
any
rate
in
my
lovetimei
relied
upon
kickums
strength
to
take
me
round
by
dulverton
it
would
make
the
journey
some
eight
miles
longer
but
what
was
that
to
a
brisk
young
horse
even
with
my
weight
upon
him
and
having
left
squire
faggus
and
annie
much
sooner
than
had
been
intended
i
had
plenty
of
time
before
me
and
too
much
ere
a
prospect
of
dinner
therefore
i
struck
to
the
right
across
the
hills
for
dulverton
pretty
ruth
was
in
the
main
street
of
the
town
with
a
basket
in
her
hand
going
home
from
the
market
why
cousin
ruth
you
are
grown
i
exclaimed
i
do
believe
you
are
ruth
and
you
were
almost
too
tall
already
at
this
the
little
thing
was
so
pleased
that
she
smiled
through
her
blushes
beautifully
and
must
needs
come
to
shake
hands
with
me
though
i
signed
to
her
not
to
do
it
because
of
my
horses
temper
but
scarcely
was
her
hand
in
mine
when
kickums
turned
like
an
eel
upon
her
and
caught
her
by
the
left
arm
with
his
teeth
so
that
she
screamed
with
agony
i
saw
the
white
of
his
vicious
eye
and
struck
him
there
with
all
my
force
with
my
left
hand
over
her
right
arm
and
he
never
used
that
eye
again
none
the
less
he
kept
his
hold
on
her
then
i
smote
him
again
on
the
jaw
and
caught
the
little
maid
up
by
her
right
hand
and
laid
her
on
the
saddle
in
front
of
me
while
the
horse
being
giddy
and
staggered
with
blows
and
foiled
of
his
spite
ran
backward
ruths
wits
were
gone
and
she
lay
before
me
in
such
a
helpless
and
senseless
way
that
i
could
have
killed
vile
kickums
i
struck
the
spurs
into
him
past
the
rowels
and
away
he
went
at
full
gallop
while
i
had
enough
to
do
to
hold
on
with
the
little
girl
lying
in
front
of
me
but
i
called
to
the
men
who
were
flocking
around
to
send
up
a
surgeon
as
quick
as
could
be
to
master
reuben
huckabacks
the
moment
i
brought
my
right
arm
to
bear
the
vicious
horse
had
no
chance
with
me
and
if
ever
a
horse
was
well
paid
for
spite
kickums
had
his
change
that
day
the
bridle
would
almost
have
held
a
whale
and
i
drew
on
it
so
that
his
lower
jaw
was
wellnigh
broken
from
him
while
with
both
spurs
i
tore
his
flanks
and
he
learned
a
little
lesson
there
are
times
when
a
man
is
more
vicious
than
any
horse
may
vie
with
therefore
by
the
time
we
had
reached
uncle
reubens
house
at
the
top
of
the
hill
the
bad
horse
was
only
too
happy
to
stop
every
string
of
his
body
was
trembling
and
his
head
hanging
down
with
impotence
i
leaped
from
his
back
at
once
and
carried
the
maiden
into
her
own
sweet
room
now
cousin
ruth
was
recovering
softly
from
her
fright
and
faintness
and
the
volley
of
the
wind
from
galloping
so
had
made
her
little
ears
quite
pink
and
shaken
her
locks
all
round
her
but
any
one
who
might
wish
to
see
a
comely
sight
and
a
moving
one
need
only
have
looked
at
ruth
huckaback
when
she
learned
and
imagined
yet
more
than
it
was
the
manner
of
her
little
ride
with
me
her
hair
was
of
a
hazelbrown
and
full
of
waving
readiness
and
with
no
concealment
of
the
trick
she
spread
it
over
her
eyes
and
face
being
so
delighted
with
her
and
so
glad
to
see
her
safe
i
kissed
her
through
the
thick
of
it
as
a
cousin
has
a
right
to
do
yea
and
ought
to
do
with
gravity
darling
i
said
he
has
bitten
you
dreadfully
show
me
your
poor
arm
dear
she
pulled
up
her
sleeve
in
the
simplest
manner
rather
to
look
at
it
herself
than
to
show
me
where
the
wound
was
her
sleeve
was
of
dark
blue
taunton
staple
and
her
white
arm
shone
coming
out
of
it
as
round
and
plump
and
velvety
as
a
stalk
of
asparagus
newly
fetched
out
of
the
ground
but
above
the
curved
soft
elbow
where
no
room
was
for
one
cross
word
according
to
our
proverb
three
sad
gashes
edged
with
crimson
spoiled
the
flow
of
the
pearly
flesh
my
presence
of
mind
was
lost
altogether
and
i
raised
the
poor
sore
arm
to
my
lips
both
to
stop
the
bleeding
and
to
take
the
venom
out
having
heard
how
wise
it
was
and
thinking
of
my
mother
but
ruth
to
my
great
amazement
drew
away
from
me
in
bitter
haste
as
if
i
had
been
inserting
instead
of
extracting
poison
for
the
bite
of
a
horse
is
most
venomous
especially
when
he
sheds
his
teeth
and
far
more
to
be
feared
than
the
bite
of
a
dog
or
even
of
a
cat
and
in
my
haste
i
had
forgotten
that
ruth
might
not
know
a
word
about
this
and
might
doubt
about
my
meaning
and
the
warmth
of
my
osculation
but
knowing
her
danger
i
durst
not
heed
her
childishness
or
her
feelings

a
maid
with
an
elbow
sharp
or
knee
hath
cross
words
two
out
of
every
three
dont
be
a
fool
cousin
ruth
i
said
catching
her
so
that
she
could
not
move
the
poison
is
soaking
into
you
do
you
think
that
i
do
it
for
pleasure
the
spread
of
shame
on
her
face
was
such
when
she
saw
her
own
misunderstanding
that
i
was
ashamed
to
look
at
her
and
occupied
myself
with
drawing
all
the
risk
of
glanders
forth
from
the
white
limb
hanging
helpless
now
and
left
entirely
to
my
will
before
i
was
quite
sure
of
having
wholly
exhausted
suction
and
when
i
had
made
the
holes
in
her
arm
look
like
the
gills
of
a
lamprey
in
came
the
doctor
partly
drunk
and
in
haste
to
get
through
his
business
ha
ha
i
see
he
cried
bite
of
a
horse

tell
me
very
poisonous

be
burned

you

your

sir
i
said
for
poor
little
ruth

fainting
again
at
his
savage
orders
but
my
cousins
arm
shall
not
be
burned
it
is
a
great
deal
too
pretty
and
i
have
sucked
all
the
poison
out
look
sir
how
clean
and
fresh
it
is
bless
my
heart
and
so
it
is
no

i
leave
you
in
excellent

at

tribus

john
ridd
i
was
at
school
with
you
and
you
beat
me
very
lamentably
when
i
tried
to
fight
with
you
you
remember
me
not
it
is
likely
enough
i
am
forced
to
take
strong
waters
john
from
infirmity
of
the
liver
attend
to
my
directions
and
i
will
call
again
in
the
morning
and
in
that
melancholy
plight
caring
nothing
for
business
went
one
of
the
cleverest
fellows
ever
known
at
tiverton
he
could
write
latin
verses
a
great
deal
faster
than
i
could
ever
write
english
prose
and
nothing
seemed
too
great
for
him
we
thought
that
he
would
go
to
oxford
and
astonish
every
one
and
write
in
the
style
of
buchanan
but
he
fell
all
abroad
very
lamentably
and
now
when
i
met
him
again
was
come
down
to
pushpin
and
shovelboard
with
a
wager
of
spirits
pending
when
master
huckaback
came
home
he
looked
at
me
very
sulkily
not
only
because
of
my
refusal
to
become
a
slave
to
the
golddigging
but
also
because
he
regarded
me
as
the
cause
of
a
savage
broil
between
simon
carfax
and
the
men
who
had
cheated
him
as
to
his
gwenny
however
when
uncle
ben
saw
ruth
and
knew
what
had
befallen
her
and
she
with
tears
in
her
eyes
declared
that
she
owed
her
life
to
cousin
ridd
the
old
man
became
very
gracious
to
me
for
if
he
loved
any
one
on
earth
it
was
his
little
granddaughter
i
could
not
stay
very
long
because
my
horse
being
quite
unfit
to
travel
from
the
injuries
which
his
violence
and
vice
had
brought
upon
him
there
was
nothing
for
me
but
to
go
on
foot
as
none
of
uncle
bens
horses
could
take
me
to
plovers
barrows
without
downright
cruelty
and
though
there
would
be
a
harvestmoon
ruth
agreed
with
me
that
i
must
not
keep
my
mother
waiting
with
no
idea
where
i
might
be
until
a
late
hour
of
the
night
i
told
ruth
all
about
our
annie
and
her
noble
furniture
and
the
little
maid
was
very
lively
although
her
wounds
were
paining
her
so
that
half
her
laughter
came
on
the
wrong
side
of
her
mouth
as
we
rather
coarsely
express
it
especially
she
laughed
about
annies
newfangled
closet
for
clothes
or
standingpress
as
she
called
it
this
had
frightened
me
so
that
i
would
not
come
without
my
stick
to
look
at
it
for
the
front
was
inlaid
with
two
fiery
dragons
and
a
glass
which
distorted
everything
making
even
annie
look
hideous
and
when
it
was
opened
a
womans
skeleton
all
in
white
revealed
itself
in
the
midst
of
three
standing
women
it
is
only
to
keep
my
best
frocks
in
shape
annie
had
explained
to
me
hanging
them
up
does
ruin
them
so
but
i
own
that
i
was
afraid
of
it
john
until
i
had
got
all
my
best
clothes
there
and
then
i
became
very
fond
of
it
but
even
now
it
frightens
me
sometimes
in
the
moonlight
having
made
poor
ruth
a
little
cheerful
with
a
full
account
of
all
annies
frocks
material
pattern
and
fashion
of
which
i
had
taken
a
list
for
my
mother
and
for
lizzie
lest
they
should
cry
out
at
mans
stupidity
about
anything
of
real
interest
i
proceeded
to
tell
her
about
my
own
troubles
and
the
sudden
departure
of
lorna
concluding
with
all
the
show
of
indifference
which
my
pride
could
muster
that
now
i
never
should
see
her
again
and
must
do
my
best
to
forget
her
as
being
so
far
above
me
i
had
not
intended
to
speak
of
this
but
ruths
face
was
so
kind
and
earnest
that
i
could
not
stop
myself
you
must
not
talk
like
that
cousin
ridd
she
said
in
a
low
and
gentle
tone
and
turning
away
her
eyes
from
me
no
lady
can
be
above
a
man
who
is
pure
and
brave
and
gentle
and
if
her
heart
be
worth
having
she
will
never
let
you
give
her
up
for
her
grandeur
and
her
nobility
she
pronounced
those
last
few
words
as
i
thought
with
a
little
bitterness
unperceived
by
herself
perhaps
for
it
was
not
in
her
appearance
but
i
attaching
great
importance
to
a
maidens
opinion
about
a
maiden
because
she
might
judge
from
experience
would
have
led
her
further
into
that
subject
but
she
declined
to
follow
having
now
no
more
to
say
in
a
matter
so
removed
from
her
then
i
asked
her
full
and
straight
and
looking
at
her
in
such
a
manner
that
she
could
not
look
away
without
appearing
vanquished
by
feelings
of
her
ownwhich
thing
was
very
vile
of
me
but
all
men
are
so
selfish
dear
cousin
tell
me
once
for
all
what
is
your
advice
to
me
my
advice
to
you
she
answered
bravely
with
her
dark
eyes
full
of
pride
and
instead
of
flinching
foiling
meis
to
do
what
every
man
must
do
if
he
would
win
fair
maiden
since
she
cannot
send
you
token
neither
is
free
to
return
to
you
follow
her
pay
your
court
to
her
show
that
you
will
not
be
forgotten
and
perhaps
she
will
look
downi
mean
she
will
relent
to
you
she
has
nothing
to
relent
about
i
have
never
vexed
nor
injured
her
my
thoughts
have
never
strayed
from
her
there
is
no
one
to
compare
with
her
then
keep
her
in
that
same
mind
about
you
see
now
i
can
advise
no
more
my
arm
is
swelling
painfully
in
spite
of
all
your
goodness
and
bitter
task
of
surgeonship
i
shall
have
another
poultice
on
and
go
to
bed
i
think
cousin
ridd
if
you
will
not
hold
me
ungrateful
i
am
so
sorry
for
your
long
walk
surely
it
might
be
avoided
give
my
love
to
dear
lizzie
oh
the
room
is
going
round
so
and
she
fainted
into
the
arms
of
sally
who
was
come
just
in
time
to
fetch
her
no
doubt
she
had
been
suffering
agony
all
the
time
she
talked
to
me
leaving
word
that
i
would
come
again
to
inquire
for
her
and
fetch
kickums
home
so
soon
as
the
harvest
permitted
me
i
gave
directions
about
the
horse
and
striding
away
from
the
ancient
town
was
soon
upon
the
moorlands
now
through
the
whole
of
that
long
walkthe
latter
part
of
which
was
led
by
starlight
till
the
moon
arosei
dwelt
in
my
young
and
foolish
way
upon
the
ordering
of
our
steps
by
a
power
beyond
us
but
as
i
could
not
bring
my
mind
to
any
clearness
upon
this
matter
and
the
stars
shed
no
light
upon
it
but
rather
confused
me
with
wondering
how
their
lord
could
attend
to
them
all
and
yet
to
a
puny
fool
like
me
it
came
to
pass
that
my
thoughts
on
the
subject
were
not
worth
ink
if
i
knew
them
but
it
is
perhaps
worth
ink
to
relate
so
far
as
i
can
do
so
mothers
delight
at
my
return
when
she
had
almost
abandoned
hope
and
concluded
that
i
was
gone
to
london
in
disgust
at
her
behaviour
and
now
she
was
looking
up
the
lane
at
the
rise
of
the
harvestmoon
in
despair
as
she
said
afterwards
but
if
she
had
despaired
in
truth
what
use
to
look
at
all
yet
according
to
the
epigram
made
by
a
good
blundellite
despair
was
never
yet
so
deep
in
sinking
as
in
seeming
despair
is
hope
just
dropped
asleep
for
better
chance
of
dreaming
and
mothers
dream
was
a
happy
one
when
she
knew
my
step
at
a
furlong
distant
for
the
night
was
of
those
that
carry
sound
thrice
as
far
as
day
can
she
recovered
herself
when
she
was
sure
and
even
made
up
her
mind
to
scold
me
and
felt
as
if
she
could
do
it
but
when
she
was
in
my
arms
into
which
she
threw
herself
and
i
by
the
light
of
the
moon
descried
the
silver
gleam
on
one
side
of
her
head
now
spreading
since
annies
departure
bless
my
heart
and
yours
therewith
no
room
was
left
for
scolding
she
hugged
me
and
she
clung
to
me
and
i
looked
at
her
with
duty
made
tenfold
and
discharged
by
love
we
said
nothing
to
one
another
but
all
was
right
between
us
even
lizzie
behaved
very
well
so
far
as
her
nature
admitted
not
even
saying
a
nasty
thing
all
the
time
she
was
getting
my
supper
ready
with
a
weak
imitation
of
annie
she
knew
that
the
gift
of
cooking
was
not
vouchsafed
by
god
to
her
but
sometimes
she
would
do
her
best
by
intellect
to
win
it
whereas
it
is
no
more
to
be
won
by
intellect
than
is
divine
poetry
an
amount
of
strong
quick
heart
is
needful
and
the
understanding
must
second
it
in
the
one
art
as
in
the
other
now
my
fare
was
very
choice
for
the
next
three
days
or
more
yet
not
turned
out
like
annies
they
could
do
a
thing
well
enough
on
the
fire
but
they
could
not
put
it
on
table
so
nor
even
have
plates
all
piping
hot
this
was
annies
special
gift
born
in
her
and
ready
to
cool
with
her
like
a
plate
borne
away
from
the
fireplace
i
sighed
sometimes
about
lorna
and
they
thought
it
was
about
the
plates
and
mother
would
stand
and
look
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
no
pleasing
him
and
lizzie
would
jerk
up
one
shoulder
and
cry
he
had
better
have
lorna
to
cook
for
him
while
the
whole
truth
was
that
i
wanted
not
to
be
plagued
about
any
cookery
but
just
to
have
something
good
and
quiet
and
then
smoke
and
think
about
lorna
nevertheless
the
time
went
on
with
one
change
and
another
and
we
gathered
all
our
harvest
in
and
parson
bowden
thanked
god
for
it
both
in
church
and
out
of
it
for
his
tithes
would
be
very
goodly
the
unmatched
cold
of
the
previous
winter
and
general
fear
of
scarcity
and
our
own
talk
about
our
ruin
had
sent
prices
up
to
a
grand
high
pitch
and
we
did
our
best
to
keep
them
there
for
nine
englishmen
out
of
every
ten
believe
that
a
bitter
winter
must
breed
a
sour
summer
and
explain
away
topmost
prices
while
according
to
my
experience
more
often
it
would
be
otherwise
except
for
the
public
thinking
so
however
i
have
said
too
much
and
if
any
farmer
reads
my
book
he
will
vow
that
i
wrote
it
for
nothing
else
except
to
rob
his
family
chapter
lxii
the
king
must
not
be
prayed
for
all
our
neighbourhood
was
surprised
that
the
doones
had
not
ere
now
attacked
and
probably
made
an
end
of
us
for
we
lay
almost
at
their
mercy
now
having
only
sergeant
bloxham
and
three
men
to
protect
us
captain
stickles
having
been
ordered
southwards
with
all
his
force
except
such
as
might
be
needful
for
collecting
toll
and
watching
the
imports
at
lynmouth
and
thence
to
porlock
the
sergeant
having
now
imbibed
a
taste
for
writing
reports
though
his
first
great
effort
had
done
him
no
good
and
only
offended
stickles
reported
weekly
from
plovers
barrows
whenever
he
could
find
a
messenger
and
though
we
fed
not
sergeant
bloxham
at
our
own
table
with
the
best
we
had
as
in
the
case
of
stickles
who
represented
his
majesty
yet
we
treated
him
so
well
that
he
reported
very
highly
of
us
as
loyal
and
truehearted
lieges
and
most
devoted
to
our
lord
the
king
and
indeed
he
could
scarcely
have
done
less
when
lizzie
wrote
great
part
of
his
reports
and
furbished
up
the
rest
to
such
a
pitch
of
lustre
that
lord
clarendon
himself
need
scarce
have
been
ashamed
of
them
and
though
this
cost
a
great
deal
of
ale
and
even
of
strong
waters
for
lizzie
would
have
it
the
duty
of
a
critic
to
stand
treat
to
the
author
and
though
it
was
otherwise
a
plague
as
giving
the
maid
such
airs
of
patronage
and
such
pretence
to
politics
yet
there
was
no
stopping
it
without
the
risk
of
mortal
offence
to
both
writer
and
reviewer
our
mother
also
while
disapproving
lizzies
long
stay
in
the
saddleroom
on
a
friday
night
and
a
saturday
and
insisting
that
betty
should
be
there
was
nevertheless
as
proud
as
need
be
that
the
king
should
read
our
eliza
s
writingsat
least
so
the
innocent
soul
believedand
we
all
looked
forward
to
something
great
as
the
fruit
of
all
this
history
and
something
great
did
come
of
it
though
not
as
we
expected
for
these
reports
or
as
many
of
them
as
were
ever
opened
stood
us
in
good
stead
the
next
year
when
we
were
accused
of
harbouring
and
comforting
guilty
rebels
now
the
reason
why
the
doones
did
not
attack
us
was
that
they
were
preparing
to
meet
another
and
more
powerful
assault
upon
their
fortress
being
assured
that
their
repulse
of
kings
troops
could
not
be
looked
over
when
brought
before
the
authorities
and
no
doubt
they
were
right
for
although
the
conflicts
in
the
government
during
that
summer
and
autumn
had
delayed
the
matter
yet
positive
orders
had
been
issued
that
these
outlaws
and
malefactors
should
at
any
price
be
brought
to
justice
when
the
sudden
death
of
king
charles
the
second
threw
all
things
into
confusion
and
all
minds
into
a
panic
we
heard
of
it
first
in
church
on
sunday
the
eighth
day
of
february
16845
from
a
cousin
of
john
fry
who
had
ridden
over
on
purpose
from
porlock
he
came
in
just
before
the
anthem
splashed
and
heated
from
his
ride
so
that
every
one
turned
and
looked
at
him
he
wanted
to
create
a
stir
knowing
how
much
would
be
made
of
him
and
he
took
the
best
way
to
do
it
for
he
let
the
anthem
go
by
very
quietlyor
rather
i
should
say
very
pleasingly
for
our
choir
was
exceeding
proud
of
itself
and
i
sang
bass
twice
as
loud
as
a
bull
to
beat
the
clerk
with
the
clarionetand
then
just
as
parson
bowden
with
a
look
of
pride
at
his
minstrels
was
kneeling
down
to
begin
the
prayer
for
the
kings
most
excellent
majesty
for
he
never
read
the
litany
except
upon
easter
sunday
up
jumps
young
sam
fry
and
shouts
i
forbid
that
there
praier
what
cried
the
parson
rising
slowly
and
looking
for
some
one
to
shut
the
door
have
we
a
rebel
in
the
congregation
for
the
parson
was
growing
shortsighted
now
and
knew
not
sam
fry
at
that
distance
no
replied
sam
not
a
whit
abashed
by
the
staring
of
all
the
parish
no
rebel
parson
but
a
man
who
mislaiketh
popery
and
murder
that
there
praier
be
a
praier
for
the
dead
nay
cried
the
parson
now
recognising
and
knowing
him
to
be
our
johns
first
cousin
you
do
not
mean
to
say
sam
that
his
gracious
majesty
is
dead
dead
as
a
stoun
poisoned
by
they
papishers
and
sam
rubbed
his
hands
with
enjoyment
at
the
effect
he
had
produced
remember
where
you
are
sam
said
parson
bowden
solemnly
when
did
this
most
sad
thing
happen
the
king
is
the
head
of
the
church
sam
fry
when
did
he
leave
her
day
afore
yesterday
twelve
oclock
warnt
us
quick
to
hear
of
un
cant
be
said
the
minister
the
tidings
can
never
have
come
so
soon
anyhow
he
will
want
it
all
the
more
let
us
pray
for
his
gracious
majesty
and
with
that
he
proceeded
as
usual
but
nobody
cried
amen
for
fear
of
being
entangled
with
popery
but
after
giving
forth
his
text
our
parson
said
a
few
words
out
of
book
about
the
many
virtues
of
his
majesty
and
selfdenial
and
devotion
comparing
his
pious
mirth
to
the
dancing
of
the
patriarch
david
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
he
added
with
some
severity
that
if
his
flock
would
not
join
their
pastor
who
was
much
more
likely
to
judge
aright
in
praying
for
the
king
the
least
they
could
do
on
returning
home
was
to
pray
that
the
king
might
not
be
dead
as
his
enemies
had
asserted
now
when
the
service
was
over
we
killed
the
king
and
we
brought
him
to
life
at
least
fifty
times
in
the
churchyard
and
sam
fry
was
mounted
on
a
high
gravestone
to
tell
every
one
all
he
knew
of
it
but
he
knew
no
more
than
he
had
told
us
in
the
church
as
before
repeated
upon
which
we
were
much
disappointed
with
him
and
inclined
to
disbelieve
him
until
he
happily
remembered
that
his
majesty
had
died
in
great
pain
with
blue
spots
on
his
breast
and
black
spots
all
across
his
back
and
these
in
the
form
of
a
cross
by
reason
of
papists
having
poisoned
him
when
sam
called
this
to
his
remembrance
or
to
his
imagination
he
was
overwhelmed
at
once
with
so
many
invitations
to
dinner
that
he
scarce
knew
which
of
them
to
accept
but
decided
in
our
favour
grieving
much
for
the
loss
of
the
king
however
greatly
it
might
be
as
the
parson
had
declared
it
was
while
telling
us
to
pray
against
it
for
the
royal
benefit
i
resolved
to
ride
to
porlock
myself
directly
after
dinner
and
make
sure
whether
he
were
dead
or
not
for
it
was
not
by
any
means
hard
to
suppose
that
sam
fry
being
johns
first
cousin
might
have
inherited
either
from
grandfather
or
grandmother
some
of
those
gifts
which
had
made
our
john
so
famous
for
mendacity
at
porlock
i
found
that
it
was
too
true
and
the
women
of
the
town
were
in
great
distress
for
the
king
had
always
been
popular
with
them
the
men
on
the
other
hand
were
forecasting
what
would
be
likely
to
ensue
and
i
myself
was
of
this
number
riding
sadly
home
again
although
bound
to
the
king
as
churchwarden
now
which
dignity
next
to
the
parsons
in
rank
is
with
us
as
it
ought
to
be
in
every
good
parish
hereditary
for
who
can
stick
to
the
church
like
the
man
whose
father
stuck
to
it
before
him
and
who
knows
all
the
little
ins
and
great
outs
which
must
in
these
troublous
times
come
across
but
though
appointed
at
last
by
virtue
of
being
best
farmer
in
the
parish
as
well
as
by
vice
of
mismanagement
on
the
part
of
my
mother
and
nicholas
snowe
who
had
thoroughly
muxed
up
everything
being
too
quickheaded
yet
while
i
dwelled
with
pride
upon
the
fact
that
i
stood
in
the
kings
shoes
as
the
manager
and
promoter
of
the
church
of
england
and
i
knew
that
we
must
miss
his
majesty
whose
arms
were
above
the
commandments
as
the
leader
of
our
thoughts
in
church
and
handsome
upon
a
guinea
nevertheless
i
kept
on
thinking
how
his
death
would
act
on
me
and
here
i
saw
it
many
ways
in
the
first
place
troubles
must
break
out
and
we
had
eightandtwenty
ricks
counting
grain
and
straw
and
hay
moreover
mother
was
growing
weak
about
riots
and
shooting
and
burning
and
she
gathered
the
bedclothes
around
her
ears
every
night
when
her
feet
were
tucked
up
and
prayed
not
to
awake
until
morning
in
the
next
place
much
rebellion
though
we
would
not
own
it
in
either
sense
of
the
verb
to
own
was
whispering
and
plucking
skirts
and
making
signs
among
us
and
the
terror
of
the
doones
helped
greatly
as
a
fruitful
tree
of
lawlessness
and
a
good
excuse
for
everybody
and
after
thisor
rather
before
it
and
first
of
all
indeed
if
i
must
state
the
true
orderarose
upon
me
the
thought
of
lorna
and
how
these
things
would
affect
her
fate
and
indeed
i
must
admit
that
it
had
occurred
to
me
sometimes
or
been
suggested
by
others
that
the
lady
lorna
had
not
behaved
altogether
kindly
since
her
departure
from
among
us
for
although
in
those
days
the
post
as
we
call
the
service
of
lettercarrying
which
now
comes
within
twenty
miles
of
us
did
not
extend
to
our
part
of
the
world
yet
it
might
have
been
possible
to
procure
for
hire
a
man
who
would
ride
post
if
lorna
feared
to
trust
the
packhorses
or
the
troopers
who
went
to
and
fro
yet
no
message
whatever
had
reached
us
neither
any
token
even
of
her
safety
in
london
as
to
this
last
however
we
had
no
misgivings
having
learned
from
the
orderlies
more
than
once
that
the
wealth
and
beauty
and
adventures
of
young
lady
lorna
dugal
were
greatly
talked
of
both
at
court
and
among
the
common
people
now
riding
sadly
homewards
in
the
sunset
of
the
early
spring
i
was
more
than
ever
touched
with
sorrow
and
a
sense
of
being
as
it
were
abandoned
and
the
weather
growing
quite
beautiful
and
so
mild
that
the
trees
were
budding
and
the
cattle
full
of
happiness
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
difference
between
the
world
of
today
and
the
world
of
this
day
twelvemonth
then
all
was
howling
desolation
all
the
earth
blocked
up
with
snow
and
all
the
air
with
barbs
of
ice
as
small
as
splintered
needles
yet
glittering
in
and
out
like
stars
and
gathering
so
upon
a
man
if
long
he
stayed
among
them
that
they
began
to
weigh
him
down
to
sleepiness
and
frozen
death
not
a
sign
of
life
was
moving
nor
was
any
change
of
view
unless
the
wild
wind
struck
the
crest
of
some
cold
drift
and
bowed
it
now
on
the
other
hand
all
was
good
the
open
palm
of
spring
was
laid
upon
the
yielding
of
the
hills
and
each
particular
valley
seemed
to
be
the
glove
for
a
finger
and
although
the
sun
was
low
and
dipping
in
the
western
clouds
the
gray
light
of
the
sea
came
up
and
took
and
taking
told
the
special
tone
of
everything
all
this
lay
upon
my
heart
without
a
word
of
thinking
spreading
light
and
shadow
there
and
the
soft
delight
of
sadness
nevertheless
i
would
it
were
the
savage
snow
around
me
and
the
piping
of
the
restless
winds
and
the
death
of
everything
for
in
those
days
i
had
lorna
then
i
thought
of
promise
fair
such
as
glowed
around
me
where
the
red
rocks
held
the
sun
when
he
was
departed
and
the
distant
crags
endeavoured
to
retain
his
memory
but
as
evening
spread
across
them
shading
with
a
silent
fold
all
the
colour
stole
away
all
remembrance
waned
and
died
so
it
has
been
with
love
i
thought
and
with
simple
truth
and
warmth
the
maid
has
chosen
the
glittering
stars
instead
of
the
plain
daylight
nevertheless
i
would
not
give
in
although
in
deep
despondency
especially
when
i
passed
the
place
where
my
dear
father
had
fought
in
vain
and
i
tried
to
see
things
right
and
then
judge
aright
about
them
this
however
was
more
easy
to
attempt
than
to
achieve
and
by
the
time
i
came
down
the
hill
i
was
none
the
wiser
only
i
could
tell
my
mother
that
the
king
was
dead
for
sure
and
she
would
have
tried
to
cry
but
for
thought
of
her
mourning
there
was
not
a
moment
for
lamenting
all
the
mourning
must
be
ready
if
we
cared
to
beat
the
snowes
in
eightandforty
hours
and
although
it
was
sunday
night
mother
now
feeling
sure
of
the
thing
sat
up
with
lizzie
cutting
patterns
and
stitching
things
on
brown
paper
and
snipping
and
laying
the
fashions
down
and
requesting
all
opinions
yet
when
given
scorning
them
insomuch
that
i
grew
weary
even
of
tobacco
which
had
comforted
me
since
lorna
and
prayed
her
to
go
on
until
the
king
should
be
alive
again
the
thought
of
that
so
flurried
herfor
she
never
yet
could
see
a
jokethat
she
laid
her
scissors
on
the
table
and
said
the
lord
forbid
john
after
what
i
have
cut
up
it
would
be
just
like
him
i
answered
with
a
knowing
smile
mother
you
had
better
stop
patterns
may
do
very
well
but
dont
cut
up
any
more
good
stuff
well
good
lack
i
am
a
fool
three
tables
pegged
with
needles
the
lord
in
his
mercy
keep
his
majesty
if
ever
he
hath
gotten
him
by
this
device
we
went
to
bed
and
not
another
stitch
was
struck
until
the
troopers
had
officetidings
that
the
king
was
truly
dead
hence
the
snowes
beat
us
by
a
day
and
both
old
betty
and
lizzie
laid
the
blame
upon
me
as
usual
almost
before
we
had
put
off
the
mourning
which
as
loyal
subjects
we
kept
for
the
king
three
months
and
a
week
rumours
of
disturbances
of
plottings
and
of
outbreak
began
to
stir
among
us
we
heard
of
fighting
in
scotland
and
buying
of
ships
on
the
continent
and
of
arms
in
dorset
and
somerset
and
we
kept
our
beacon
in
readiness
to
give
signals
of
a
landing
or
rather
the
soldiers
did
for
we
having
trustworthy
reports
that
the
king
had
been
to
high
mass
himself
in
the
abbey
of
westminster
making
all
the
bishops
go
with
him
and
all
the
guards
in
london
and
then
tortured
all
the
protestants
who
dared
to
wait
outside
moreover
had
received
from
the
pope
a
flower
grown
in
the
virgin
marys
garden
and
warranted
to
last
for
ever
we
of
the
moderate
party
hearing
all
this
and
ten
times
as
much
and
having
no
love
for
this
sour
james
such
as
we
had
for
the
lively
charles
were
ready
to
wait
for
what
might
happen
rather
than
care
about
stopping
it
therefore
we
listened
to
rumours
gladly
and
shook
our
heads
with
gravity
and
predicted
every
man
something
but
scarce
any
two
the
same
nevertheless
in
our
part
things
went
on
as
usual
until
the
middle
of
june
was
nigh
we
ploughed
the
ground
and
sowed
the
corn
and
tended
the
cattle
and
heeded
every
one
his
neighbours
business
as
carefully
as
heretofore
and
the
only
thing
that
moved
us
much
was
that
annie
had
a
baby
this
being
a
very
fine
child
with
blue
eyes
and
christened
john
in
compliment
to
me
and
with
me
for
his
godfather
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
him
and
when
mother
or
lizzie
would
ask
me
all
of
a
sudden
and
treacherously
when
the
fire
flared
up
at
suppertime
for
we
always
kept
a
little
wood
just
alight
in
summertime
and
enough
to
make
the
pot
boil
then
when
they
would
say
to
me
john
what
are
you
thinking
of
at
a
word
speak
i
would
always
answer
little
john
faggus
and
so
they
made
no
more
of
me
but
when
i
was
down
on
saturday
the
thirteenth
of
june
at
the
blacksmiths
forge
by
brendon
town
where
the
lynnstream
runs
so
close
that
he
dips
his
horseshoes
in
it
and
where
the
news
is
apt
to
come
first
of
all
to
our
neighbourhood
except
upon
a
sunday
while
we
were
talking
of
the
haycrop
and
of
a
great
sheepstealer
round
the
corner
came
a
man
upon
a
piebald
horse
looking
flagged
and
weary
but
seeing
half
a
dozen
of
us
young
and
brisk
and
hearty
he
made
a
flourish
with
his
horse
and
waved
a
blue
flag
vehemently
shouting
with
great
glory
monmouth
and
the
protestant
faith
monmouth
and
no
popery
monmouth
the
good
kings
eldest
son
down
with
the
poisoning
murderer
down
with
the
black
usurper
and
to
the
devil
with
all
papists
why
so
thou
little
varlet
i
asked
very
quietly
for
the
man
was
too
small
to
quarrel
with
yet
knowing
lorna
to
be
a
papist
as
we
choose
to
call
themthough
they
might
as
well
call
us
kingists
after
the
head
of
our
churchi
thought
that
this
scurvy
scampish
knave
might
show
them
the
way
to
the
place
he
mentioned
unless
his
courage
failed
him
papist
yourself
be
you
said
the
fellow
not
daring
to
answer
much
then
take
this
and
read
it
and
he
handed
me
a
long
rigmarole
which
he
called
a
declaration
i
saw
that
it
was
but
a
heap
of
lies
and
thrust
it
into
the
blacksmiths
fire
and
blew
the
bellows
thrice
at
it
no
one
dared
attempt
to
stop
me
for
my
mood
had
not
been
sweet
of
late
and
of
course
they
knew
my
strength
the
man
rode
on
with
a
muttering
noise
having
won
no
recruits
from
us
by
force
of
my
example
and
he
stopped
at
the
alehouse
farther
down
where
the
road
goes
away
from
the
lynnstream
some
of
us
went
thither
after
a
time
when
our
horses
were
shodden
and
rasped
for
although
we
might
not
like
the
man
we
might
be
glad
of
his
tidings
which
seemed
to
be
something
wonderful
he
had
set
up
his
blue
flag
in
the
taproom
and
was
teaching
every
one
here
coomth
maister
jan
ridd
said
the
landlady
being
well
pleased
with
the
call
for
beer
and
cider
her
hath
been
to
lunnontown
and
live
within
a
maile
of
me
arl
the
news
coom
from
them
nowadays
instead
of
from
here
as
her
ought
to
do
if
jan
ridd
say
it
be
true
i
will
try
almost
to
belave
it
hath
the
good
duke
landed
sir
and
she
looked
at
me
over
a
foaming
cup
and
blew
the
froth
off
and
put
more
in
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
true
enough
i
answered
before
drinking
and
too
true
mistress
pugsley
many
a
poor
man
will
die
but
none
shall
die
from
our
parish
nor
from
brendon
if
i
can
help
it
and
i
knew
that
i
could
help
it
for
every
one
in
those
little
places
would
abide
by
my
advice
not
only
from
the
fame
of
my
schooling
and
long
sojourn
in
london
but
also
because
i
had
earned
repute
for
being
very
slow
and
sure
and
with
nine
people
out
of
ten
this
is
the
very
best
recommendation
for
they
think
themselves
much
before
you
in
wit
and
under
no
obligation
but
rather
conferring
a
favour
by
doing
the
thing
that
you
do
hence
if
i
cared
for
influencewhich
means
for
the
most
part
making
people
do
ones
will
without
knowing
itmy
first
step
toward
it
would
be
to
be
called
in
common
parlance
slow
but
sure
for
the
next
fortnight
we
were
daily
troubled
with
conflicting
rumours
each
man
relating
what
he
desired
rather
than
what
he
had
right
to
believe
we
were
told
that
the
duke
had
been
proclaimed
king
of
england
in
every
town
of
dorset
and
of
somerset
that
he
had
won
a
great
battle
at
axminster
and
another
at
bridport
and
another
somewhere
else
that
all
the
western
counties
had
risen
as
one
man
for
him
and
all
the
militia
had
joined
his
ranks
that
taunton
and
bridgwater
and
bristowe
were
all
mad
with
delight
the
two
former
being
in
his
hands
and
the
latter
craving
to
be
so
and
then
on
the
other
hand
we
heard
that
the
duke
had
been
vanquished
and
put
to
flight
and
upon
being
apprehended
had
confessed
himself
an
impostor
and
a
papist
as
bad
as
the
king
was
we
longed
for
colonel
stickles
as
he
always
became
in
time
of
war
though
he
fell
back
to
captain
and
even
lieutenant
directly
the
fight
was
over
for
then
we
should
have
won
trusty
news
as
well
as
good
consideration
but
even
sergeant
bloxham
much
against
his
will
was
gone
having
left
his
heart
with
our
lizzie
and
a
collection
of
all
his
writings
all
the
soldiers
had
been
ordered
away
at
full
speed
for
exeter
to
join
the
duke
of
albemarle
or
if
he
were
gone
to
follow
him
as
for
us
who
had
fed
them
so
long
although
not
quite
for
nothing
we
must
take
our
chance
of
doones
or
any
other
enemies
now
all
these
tidings
moved
me
a
little
not
enough
to
spoil
appetite
but
enough
to
make
things
lively
and
to
teach
me
that
look
of
wisdom
which
is
bred
of
practice
only
and
the
hearing
of
many
lies
therefore
i
withheld
my
judgment
fearing
to
be
triumphed
over
if
it
should
happen
to
miss
the
mark
but
mother
and
lizzie
ten
times
in
a
day
predicted
all
they
could
imagine
and
their
prophecies
increased
in
strength
according
to
contradiction
yet
this
was
not
in
the
proper
style
for
a
house
like
ours
which
knew
the
news
or
at
least
had
known
it
and
still
was
famous
all
around
for
the
last
advices
even
from
lynmouth
people
sent
up
to
plovers
barrows
to
ask
how
things
were
going
on
and
it
was
very
grievous
to
answer
that
in
truth
we
knew
not
neither
had
heard
for
days
and
days
and
our
reputation
was
so
great
especially
since
the
death
of
the
king
had
gone
abroad
from
oare
parish
that
many
inquirers
would
only
wink
and
lay
a
finger
on
the
lip
as
if
to
say
you
know
well
enough
but
see
not
fit
to
tell
me
and
before
the
end
arrived
those
people
believed
that
they
had
been
right
all
along
and
that
we
had
concealed
the
truth
from
them
for
i
myself
became
involved
god
knows
how
much
against
my
will
and
my
proper
judgment
in
the
troubles
and
the
conflict
and
the
cruel
work
coming
afterwards
if
ever
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
anything
in
all
my
life
it
was
at
this
particular
time
and
as
stern
and
strong
as
could
be
i
had
resolved
to
let
things
passto
hear
about
them
gladly
to
encourage
all
my
friends
to
talk
and
myself
to
express
opinion
upon
each
particular
point
when
in
the
fullness
of
time
no
further
doubt
could
be
but
all
my
policy
went
for
nothing
through
a
few
touches
of
feeling
one
day
at
the
beginning
of
july
i
came
home
from
mowing
about
noon
or
a
little
later
to
fetch
some
cider
for
all
of
us
and
to
eat
a
morsel
of
bacon
for
mowing
was
no
joke
that
year
the
summer
being
wonderfully
wet
even
for
our
wet
country
and
the
swathe
falling
heavier
over
the
scythe
than
ever
i
could
remember
it
we
were
drenched
with
rain
almost
every
day
but
the
mowing
must
be
done
somehow
and
we
must
trust
to
god
for
the
haymaking
in
the
courtyard
i
saw
a
little
cart
with
iron
brakes
underneath
it
such
as
fastidious
people
use
to
deaden
the
jolting
of
the
road
but
few
men
under
a
lord
or
baronet
would
be
so
particular
therefore
i
wondered
who
our
noble
visitor
could
be
but
when
i
entered
the
kitchenplace
brushing
up
my
hair
for
somebody
behold
it
was
no
one
greater
than
our
annie
with
my
godson
in
her
arms
and
looking
pale
and
tearbegone
and
at
first
she
could
not
speak
to
me
but
presently
having
sat
down
a
little
and
received
much
praise
for
her
baby
she
smiled
and
blushed
and
found
her
tongue
as
if
she
had
never
gone
from
us
how
natural
it
all
looks
again
oh
i
love
this
old
kitchen
so
baby
dear
only
look
at
it
wid
him
pitty
pitty
eyes
and
him
tongue
out
of
his
mousy
but
who
put
the
flourriddle
up
there
and
look
at
the
pestle
and
mortar
and
rust
i
declare
in
the
patty
pans
and
a
book
positively
a
dirty
book
where
the
clean
skewers
ought
to
hang
oh
lizzie
lizzie
lizzie
you
may
just
as
well
cease
lamenting
i
said
for
you
cant
alter
lizzies
nature
and
you
will
only
make
mother
uncomfortable
and
perhaps
have
a
quarrel
with
lizzie
who
is
proud
as
punch
of
her
housekeeping
she
cried
annie
with
all
the
contempt
that
could
be
compressed
in
a
syllable
well
john
no
doubt
you
are
right
about
it
i
will
try
not
to
notice
things
but
it
is
a
hard
thing
after
all
my
care
to
see
everything
going
to
ruin
but
what
can
be
expected
of
a
girl
who
knows
all
the
kings
of
carthage
there
were
no
kings
of
carthage
annie
they
were
called
why
let
me
seethey
were
calledoh
something
else
never
mind
what
they
were
called
said
annie
will
they
cook
our
dinner
for
us
but
now
john
i
am
in
such
trouble
all
this
talk
is
makebelieve
dont
you
cry
my
dear
dont
cry
my
darling
sister
i
answered
as
she
dropped
into
the
worn
place
of
the
settle
and
bent
above
her
infant
rocking
as
if
both
their
hearts
were
one
dont
you
know
annie
i
cannot
tell
but
i
know
or
at
least
i
mean
i
have
heard
the
men
of
experience
say
it
is
so
bad
for
the
baby
perhaps
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
do
john
said
annie
looking
up
at
me
with
a
gleam
of
her
old
laughing
but
how
can
i
help
crying
i
am
in
such
trouble
tell
me
what
it
is
my
dear
any
grief
of
yours
will
vex
me
greatly
but
i
will
try
to
bear
it
then
john
it
is
just
this
tom
has
gone
off
with
the
rebels
and
you
must
oh
you
must
go
after
him
chapter
lxiii
john
is
worsted
by
the
women
moved
as
i
was
by
annies
tears
and
gentle
style
of
coaxing
and
most
of
all
by
my
love
for
her
i
yet
declared
that
i
could
not
go
and
leave
our
house
and
homestead
far
less
my
dear
mother
and
lizzie
at
the
mercy
of
the
merciless
doones
is
that
all
your
objection
john
asked
annie
in
her
quick
panting
way
would
you
go
but
for
that
john
now
i
said
be
in
no
such
hurryfor
while
i
was
gradually
yielding
i
liked
to
pass
it
through
my
fingers
as
if
my
fingers
shaped
it
there
are
many
things
to
be
thought
about
and
many
ways
of
viewing
it
oh
you
never
can
have
loved
lorna
no
wonder
you
gave
her
up
so
john
you
can
love
nobody
but
your
oatricks
and
your
hayricks
sister
mine
because
i
rant
not
neither
rave
of
what
i
feel
can
you
be
so
shallow
as
to
dream
that
i
feel
nothing
what
is
your
love
for
tom
faggus
what
is
your
love
for
your
baby
pretty
darling
as
he
is
to
compare
with
such
a
love
as
for
ever
dwells
with
me
because
i
do
not
prate
of
it
because
it
is
beyond
me
not
only
to
express
but
even
form
to
my
own
heart
in
thoughts
because
i
do
not
shape
my
face
and
would
scorn
to
play
to
it
as
a
thing
of
acting
and
lay
it
out
before
you
are
you
fools
enough
to
think
but
here
i
stopped
having
said
more
than
was
usual
with
me
i
am
very
sorry
john
dear
john
i
am
so
sorry
what
a
shallow
fool
i
am
i
will
go
seek
your
husband
i
said
to
change
the
subject
for
even
to
annie
i
would
not
lay
open
all
my
heart
about
lorna
but
only
upon
condition
that
you
ensure
this
house
and
people
from
the
doones
meanwhile
even
for
the
sake
of
tom
i
cannot
leave
all
helpless
the
oatricks
and
the
hayricks
which
are
my
only
love
they
are
welcome
to
make
cinders
of
but
i
will
not
have
mother
treated
so
nor
even
little
lizzie
although
you
scorn
your
sister
so
oh
john
i
do
think
you
are
the
hardest
as
well
as
the
softest
of
all
the
men
i
know
not
even
a
womans
bitter
word
but
what
you
pay
her
out
for
will
you
never
understand
that
we
are
not
like
you
john
we
say
all
sorts
of
spiteful
things
without
a
bit
of
meaning
john
for
gods
sake
fetch
tom
home
and
then
revile
me
as
you
please
and
i
will
kneel
and
thank
you
i
will
not
promise
to
fetch
him
home
i
answered
being
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
lost
command
so
but
i
will
promise
to
do
my
best
if
we
can
only
hit
on
a
plan
for
leaving
mother
harmless
annie
thought
for
a
little
while
trying
to
gather
her
smooth
clear
brow
into
maternal
wrinkles
and
then
she
looked
at
her
child
and
said
i
will
risk
it
for
daddys
sake
darling
you
precious
soul
for
daddys
sake
i
asked
her
what
she
was
going
to
risk
she
would
not
tell
me
but
took
upper
hand
and
saw
to
my
cidercans
and
bacon
and
went
from
corner
to
cupboard
exactly
as
if
she
had
never
been
married
only
without
an
apron
on
and
then
she
said
now
to
your
mowers
john
and
make
the
most
of
this
fine
afternoon
kiss
your
godson
before
you
go
and
i
being
used
to
obey
her
in
little
things
of
that
sort
kissed
the
baby
and
took
my
cans
and
went
back
to
my
scythe
again
by
the
time
i
came
home
it
was
dark
night
and
pouring
again
with
a
foggy
rain
such
as
we
have
in
july
even
more
than
in
january
being
soaked
all
through
and
through
and
with
water
quelching
in
my
boots
like
a
pump
with
a
bad
bucket
i
was
only
too
glad
to
find
annies
bright
face
and
quick
figure
flitting
in
and
out
the
firelight
instead
of
lizzie
sitting
grandly
with
a
feast
of
literature
and
not
a
drop
of
gravy
mother
was
in
the
corner
also
with
her
cheerycoloured
ribbons
glistening
very
nice
by
candlelight
looking
at
annie
now
and
then
with
memories
of
her
babyhood
and
then
at
her
having
a
baby
yet
half
afraid
of
praising
her
much
for
fear
of
that
young
lizzie
but
lizzie
showed
no
jealousy
she
truly
loved
our
annie
now
that
she
was
gone
from
us
and
she
wanted
to
know
all
sorts
of
things
and
she
adored
the
baby
therefore
annie
was
allowed
to
attend
to
me
as
she
used
to
do
now
john
you
must
start
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
she
said
when
the
others
had
left
the
room
but
somehow
she
stuck
to
the
baby
to
fetch
me
back
my
rebel
according
to
your
promise
not
so
i
replied
misliking
the
job
all
i
promised
was
to
go
if
this
house
were
assured
against
any
onslaught
of
the
doones
just
so
and
here
is
that
assurance
with
these
words
she
drew
forth
a
paper
and
laid
it
on
my
knee
with
triumph
enjoying
my
amazement
this
as
you
may
suppose
was
great
not
only
at
the
document
but
also
at
her
possession
of
it
for
in
truth
it
was
no
less
than
a
formal
undertaking
on
the
part
of
the
doones
not
to
attack
plovers
barrows
farm
or
molest
any
of
the
inmates
or
carry
off
any
chattels
during
the
absence
of
john
ridd
upon
a
special
errand
this
document
was
signed
not
only
by
the
counsellor
but
by
many
other
doones
whether
carvers
name
were
there
i
could
not
say
for
certain
as
of
course
he
would
not
sign
it
under
his
name
of
carver
and
i
had
never
heard
lorna
say
to
what
if
any
he
had
been
baptized
in
the
face
of
such
a
deed
as
this
i
could
no
longer
refuse
to
go
and
having
received
my
promise
annie
told
me
as
was
only
fair
how
she
had
procured
that
paper
it
was
both
a
clever
and
courageous
act
and
would
have
seemed
to
me
at
first
sight
far
beyond
annies
power
but
none
may
gauge
a
womans
power
when
her
love
and
faith
are
moved
the
first
thing
annie
had
done
was
this
she
made
herself
look
ugly
this
was
not
an
easy
thing
but
she
had
learned
a
great
deal
from
her
husband
upon
the
subject
of
disguises
it
hurt
her
feelings
not
a
little
to
make
so
sad
a
fright
of
herself
but
what
could
it
matterif
she
lost
tom
she
must
be
a
far
greater
fright
in
earnest
than
now
she
was
in
seeming
and
then
she
left
her
child
asleep
under
betty
muxworthys
tendancefor
betty
took
to
that
child
as
if
there
never
had
been
a
child
beforeand
away
she
went
in
her
own
springcart
as
the
name
of
that
engine
proved
to
be
without
a
word
to
any
one
except
the
old
man
who
had
driven
her
from
molland
parish
that
morning
and
who
coolly
took
one
of
our
best
horses
without
by
your
leave
to
any
one
annie
made
the
old
man
drive
her
within
easy
reach
of
the
doonegate
whose
position
she
knew
well
enough
from
all
our
talk
about
it
and
there
she
bade
the
old
man
stay
until
she
should
return
to
him
then
with
her
comely
figure
hidden
by
a
dirty
old
womans
cloak
and
her
fair
young
face
defaced
by
patches
and
by
liniments
so
that
none
might
covet
her
she
addressed
the
young
man
at
the
gate
in
a
cracked
and
trembling
voice
and
they
were
scarcely
civil
to
the
old
hag
as
they
called
her
she
said
that
she
bore
important
tidings
for
sir
counsellor
himself
and
must
be
conducted
to
him
to
him
accordingly
she
was
led
without
even
any
hoodwinking
for
she
had
spectacles
over
her
eyes
and
made
believe
not
to
see
ten
yards
she
found
sir
counsellor
at
home
and
when
the
rest
were
out
of
sight
threw
off
all
disguise
to
him
flashing
forth
as
a
lovely
young
woman
from
all
her
wraps
and
disfigurements
she
flung
her
patches
on
the
floor
amid
the
old
mans
laughter
and
let
her
tuckedup
hair
come
down
and
then
went
up
and
kissed
him
worthy
and
reverend
counsellor
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
she
began
so
i
should
think
from
your
proceedingsthe
old
man
interruptedah
if
i
were
half
my
age
if
you
were
i
would
not
sue
so
but
most
excellent
counsellor
you
owe
me
some
amends
you
know
for
the
way
in
which
you
robbed
me
beyond
a
doubt
i
do
my
dear
you
have
put
it
rather
strongly
and
it
might
offend
some
people
nevertheless
i
own
my
debt
having
so
fair
a
creditor
and
do
you
remember
how
you
slept
and
how
much
we
made
of
you
and
would
have
seen
you
home
sir
only
you
did
not
wish
it
and
for
excellent
reasons
child
my
best
escort
was
in
my
cloak
after
we
made
the
cream
to
rise
ha
ha
the
unholy
spell
my
pretty
child
has
it
injured
you
yes
i
fear
it
has
said
annie
or
whence
can
all
my
ill
luck
come
and
here
she
showed
some
signs
of
crying
knowing
that
counsellor
hated
it
you
shall
not
have
ill
luck
my
dear
i
have
heard
all
about
your
marriage
to
a
very
noble
highwayman
ah
you
made
a
mistake
in
that
you
were
worthy
of
a
doone
my
child
your
frying
was
a
blessing
meant
for
those
who
can
appreciate
my
husband
can
appreciate
she
answered
very
proudly
but
what
i
wish
to
know
is
this
will
you
try
to
help
me
the
counsellor
answered
that
he
would
do
so
if
her
needs
were
moderate
whereupon
she
opened
her
meaning
to
him
and
told
of
all
her
anxieties
considering
that
lorna
was
gone
and
her
necklace
in
his
possession
and
that
i
against
whom
alone
of
us
the
doones
could
bear
any
malice
would
be
out
of
the
way
all
the
while
the
old
man
readily
undertook
that
our
house
should
not
be
assaulted
nor
our
property
molested
until
my
return
and
to
the
promptitude
of
his
pledge
two
things
perhaps
contributed
namely
that
he
knew
not
how
we
were
stripped
of
all
defenders
and
that
some
of
his
own
forces
were
away
in
the
rebel
camp
for
as
i
learned
thereafter
the
doones
being
now
in
direct
feud
with
the
present
government
and
sure
to
be
crushed
if
that
prevailed
had
resolved
to
drop
all
religious
questions
and
cast
in
their
lot
with
monmouth
and
the
turbulent
youths
being
long
restrained
from
their
wonted
outlet
for
vehemence
by
the
troopers
in
the
neighbourhood
were
only
too
glad
to
rush
forth
upon
any
promise
of
blows
and
excitement
however
annie
knew
little
of
this
but
took
the
counsellors
pledge
as
a
mark
of
especial
favour
in
her
behalf
which
it
may
have
been
to
some
extent
and
thanked
him
for
it
most
heartily
and
felt
that
he
had
earned
the
necklace
while
he
like
an
ancient
gentleman
disclaimed
all
obligation
and
sent
her
under
an
escort
safe
to
her
own
cart
again
but
annie
repassing
the
sentinels
with
her
youth
restored
and
blooming
with
the
flush
of
triumph
went
up
to
them
very
gravely
and
said
the
old
hag
wishes
you
goodevening
gentlemen
and
so
made
her
best
curtsey
now
look
at
it
as
i
would
there
was
no
excuse
left
for
me
after
the
promise
given
dear
annie
had
not
only
cheated
the
doones
but
also
had
gotten
the
best
of
me
by
a
pledge
to
a
thing
impossible
and
i
bitterly
said
i
am
not
like
lorna
a
pledge
once
given
i
keep
it
i
will
not
have
a
word
against
lorna
cried
annie
i
will
answer
for
her
truth
as
surely
as
i
would
for
my
own
or
yours
john
and
with
that
she
vanquished
me
but
when
my
poor
mother
heard
that
i
was
committed
by
word
of
honour
to
a
wildgoose
chase
among
the
rebels
after
that
runagate
tom
faggus
she
simply
stared
and
would
not
believe
it
for
lately
i
had
joked
with
her
in
a
little
style
of
jerks
as
people
do
when
out
of
sorts
and
she
not
understanding
this
and
knowing
jokes
to
be
out
of
my
power
would
only
look
and
sigh
and
toss
and
hope
that
i
meant
nothing
at
last
however
we
convinced
her
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
must
be
off
in
the
early
morning
and
leave
john
fry
with
the
hay
crop
then
mother
was
ready
to
fall
upon
annie
as
not
content
with
disgracing
us
by
wedding
a
man
of
new
honesty
if
indeed
of
any
but
laying
traps
to
catch
her
brother
and
entangle
him
perhaps
to
his
death
for
the
sake
of
a
worthless
fellow
and
felonshe
was
going
to
say
as
by
the
shape
of
her
lips
i
knew
but
i
laid
my
hand
upon
dear
mothers
lips
because
what
must
be
must
be
and
if
mother
and
daughter
stayed
at
home
better
in
love
than
in
quarrelling
right
early
in
the
morning
i
was
off
without
word
to
any
one
knowing
that
mother
and
sister
mine
had
cried
each
her
good
self
to
sleep
relenting
when
the
light
was
out
and
sorry
for
hard
words
and
thoughts
and
yet
too
much
alike
in
nature
to
understand
each
other
therefore
i
took
good
kickums
who
although
with
one
eye
spoiled
was
worth
ten
sweettempered
horses
to
a
man
who
knew
how
to
manage
him
and
being
well
charged
both
with
bacon
and
powder
forth
i
set
on
my
wildgoose
chase
for
this
i
claim
no
bravery
i
cared
but
little
what
came
of
it
save
for
mothers
sake
and
annies
and
the
keeping
of
the
farm
and
discomfiture
of
the
snowes
and
lamenting
of
lorna
at
my
death
if
die
i
must
in
a
lonesome
manner
not
found
out
till
afterwards
and
bleaching
bones
left
to
weep
over
however
i
had
a
little
kettle
and
a
pound
and
a
half
of
tobacco
and
two
dirty
pipes
and
a
clean
one
also
a
bit
of
clothes
for
change
also
a
brisket
of
hung
venison
and
four
loaves
of
farmhouse
bread
and
of
the
upper
side
of
bacon
a
stone
and
a
half
it
might
benot
to
mention
divers
small
things
for
campaigning
which
may
come
in
handily
when
no
one
else
has
gotten
them
we
went
away
in
merry
style
my
horse
being
ready
for
anything
and
i
only
glad
of
a
bit
of
change
after
months
of
working
and
brooding
with
no
content
to
crown
the
work
no
hope
to
hatch
the
brooding
or
without
hatching
to
reckon
it
who
could
tell
but
what
lorna
might
be
discovered
or
at
any
rate
heard
of
before
the
end
of
this
campaign
if
campaign
it
could
be
called
of
a
man
who
went
to
fight
nobody
only
to
redeem
a
runagate
and
vexed
as
i
was
about
the
hay
and
the
hunchbacked
ricks
john
was
sure
to
make
which
spoil
the
look
of
a
farmyard
still
even
this
was
better
than
to
have
the
mows
and
houses
fired
as
i
had
nightly
expected
and
been
worn
out
with
the
worry
of
it
yet
there
was
one
thing
rather
unfavourable
to
my
present
enterprise
namely
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
country
i
was
bound
to
nor
even
in
what
part
of
it
my
business
might
be
supposed
to
lie
for
beside
the
uncertainty
caused
by
the
conflict
of
reports
it
was
likely
that
king
monmouths
army
would
be
moving
from
place
to
place
according
to
the
prospect
of
supplies
and
of
reinforcements
however
there
would
arise
more
chance
of
getting
news
as
i
went
on
and
my
road
being
towards
the
east
and
south
dulverton
would
not
lie
so
very
far
aside
of
it
but
what
it
might
be
worth
a
visit
both
to
collect
the
latest
tidings
and
to
consult
the
maps
and
plans
in
uncle
reubens
parlour
therefore
i
drew
the
offhand
rein
at
the
crossroad
on
the
hills
and
made
for
the
town
expecting
perhaps
to
have
breakfast
with
master
huckaback
and
ruth
to
help
and
encourage
us
this
little
maiden
was
now
become
a
very
great
favourite
with
me
having
long
outgrown
no
doubt
her
childish
fancies
and
follies
such
as
my
mother
and
annie
had
planted
under
her
soft
brown
hair
it
had
been
my
duty
as
well
as
my
true
interest
for
uncle
ben
was
more
and
more
testy
as
he
went
on
golddigging
to
ride
thither
now
and
again
to
inquire
what
the
doctor
thought
of
her
not
that
her
wounds
were
long
in
healing
but
that
people
can
scarcely
be
too
careful
and
too
inquisitive
after
a
great
horsebite
and
she
always
let
me
look
at
the
arm
as
i
had
been
first
doctor
and
she
held
it
up
in
a
graceful
manner
curving
at
the
elbow
and
with
a
sweep
of
white
roundness
going
to
a
wrist
the
size
of
my
thumb
or
so
and
without
any
thimbletop
standing
forth
such
as
even
our
annie
had
but
gradually
all
i
could
see
above
the
elbow
where
the
bite
had
been
was
very
clear
transparent
skin
with
very
firm
sweet
flesh
below
and
three
little
blue
marks
as
far
asunder
as
the
prongs
of
a
toastingfork
and
no
deeper
than
where
a
twig
has
chafed
the
peel
of
a
waxen
apple
and
then
i
used
to
say
in
fun
as
the
children
do
shall
i
kiss
it
to
make
it
well
dear
now
ruth
looked
very
grave
indeed
upon
hearing
of
this
my
enterprise
and
crying
said
she
could
almost
cry
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
mother
did
i
know
the
risks
and
chances
not
of
the
battlefield
alone
but
of
the
havoc
afterwards
the
swearing
away
of
innocent
lives
and
the
hurdle
and
the
hanging
and
if
i
would
please
not
to
laugh
which
was
so
unkind
of
me
had
i
never
heard
of
imprisonments
and
torturing
with
the
cruel
boot
and
selling
into
slavery
where
the
sun
and
the
lash
outvied
one
another
in
cutting
a
man
to
pieces
i
replied
that
of
all
these
things
i
had
heard
and
would
take
especial
care
to
steer
me
free
of
all
of
them
my
duty
was
all
that
i
wished
to
do
and
none
could
harm
me
for
doing
that
and
i
begged
my
cousin
to
give
me
goodspeed
instead
of
talking
dolefully
upon
this
she
changed
her
manner
wholly
becoming
so
lively
and
cheerful
that
i
was
convinced
of
her
indifference
and
surprised
even
more
than
gratified
go
and
earn
your
spurs
cousin
ridd
she
said
you
are
strong
enough
for
anything
which
side
is
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
doughty
arm
have
i
not
told
you
ruth
i
answered
not
being
fond
of
this
kind
of
talk
more
suitable
for
lizzie
that
i
do
not
mean
to
join
either
side
that
is
to
say
until
until
as
the
common
proverb
goes
you
know
which
way
the
cat
will
jump
oh
john
ridd
oh
john
ridd
nothing
of
the
sort
said
i
what
a
hurry
you
are
in
i
am
for
the
king
of
course
but
not
enough
to
fight
for
him
only
enough
to
vote
i
suppose
or
drink
his
health
or
shout
for
him
i
cant
make
you
out
today
cousin
ruth
you
are
nearly
as
bad
as
lizzie
you
do
not
say
any
bitter
things
but
you
seem
to
mean
them
no
cousin
think
not
so
of
me
it
is
far
more
likely
that
i
say
them
without
meaning
them
anyhow
it
is
not
like
you
and
i
know
not
what
i
can
have
done
in
any
way
to
vex
you
dear
me
nothing
cousin
ridd
you
never
do
anything
to
vex
me
then
i
hope
i
shall
do
something
now
ruth
when
i
say
goodbye
god
knows
if
we
ever
shall
meet
again
ruth
but
i
hope
we
may
to
be
sure
we
shall
she
answered
in
her
brightest
manner
try
not
to
look
wretched
john
you
are
as
happy
as
a
maypole
and
you
as
a
rose
in
may
i
said
and
pretty
nearly
as
pretty
give
my
love
to
uncle
ben
and
i
trust
him
to
keep
on
the
winning
side
of
that
you
need
have
no
misgivings
never
yet
has
he
failed
of
it
now
cousin
ridd
why
go
you
not
you
hurried
me
so
at
breakfast
time
my
only
reason
for
waiting
ruth
is
that
you
have
not
kissed
me
as
you
are
almost
bound
to
do
for
the
last
time
perhaps
of
seeing
me
oh
if
that
is
all
just
fetch
the
stool
and
i
will
do
my
best
cousin
i
pray
you
be
not
so
vexatious
you
always
used
to
do
it
nicely
without
any
stool
ruth
ah
but
you
are
grown
since
then
and
become
a
famous
man
john
ridd
and
a
member
of
the
nobility
go
your
way
and
win
your
spurs
i
want
no
lipservice
being
at
the
end
of
my
wits
i
did
even
as
she
ordered
me
at
least
i
had
no
spurs
to
win
because
there
were
big
ones
on
my
boots
paid
for
in
the
easter
bill
and
made
by
a
famous
saddler
so
as
never
to
clog
with
marshweed
but
prick
as
hard
as
any
horse
in
reason
could
desire
and
kickums
never
wanted
spurs
but
always
went
tailforemost
if
anybody
offered
them
for
his
consideration
chapter
lxiv
slaughter
in
the
marshes
we
rattled
away
at
a
merry
pace
out
of
the
town
of
dulverton
my
horse
being
gaily
fed
and
myself
quite
fit
again
for
going
of
course
i
was
puzzled
about
cousin
ruth
for
her
behaviour
was
not
at
all
such
as
i
had
expected
and
indeed
i
had
hoped
for
a
far
more
loving
and
moving
farewell
than
i
got
from
her
but
i
said
to
myself
it
is
useless
ever
to
count
upon
what
a
woman
will
do
and
i
think
that
i
must
have
vexed
her
almost
as
much
as
she
vexed
me
and
now
to
see
what
comes
of
it
so
i
put
my
horse
across
the
moorland
and
he
threw
his
chest
out
bravely
now
if
i
tried
to
set
down
at
length
all
the
things
that
happened
to
me
upon
this
adventure
every
in
and
out
and
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
that
occupied
me
together
with
the
things
i
saw
and
the
things
i
heard
of
however
much
the
wiser
people
might
applaud
my
narrative
it
is
likely
enough
that
idle
readers
might
exclaim
what
ails
this
man
knows
he
not
that
men
of
parts
and
of
real
understanding
have
told
us
all
we
care
to
hear
of
that
miserable
business
let
him
keep
to
his
farm
and
his
bacon
and
his
wrestling
and
constant
feeding
fearing
to
meet
with
such
rebuffs
which
after
my
death
would
vex
me
i
will
try
to
set
down
only
what
is
needful
for
my
story
and
the
clearing
of
my
character
and
the
good
name
of
our
parish
but
the
manner
in
which
i
was
bandied
about
by
false
information
from
pillar
to
post
or
at
other
times
driven
quite
out
of
my
way
by
the
presence
of
the
kings
soldiers
may
be
known
by
the
names
of
the
following
towns
to
which
i
was
sent
in
succession
bath
frome
wells
wincanton
glastonbury
shepton
bradford
axbridge
somerton
and
bridgwater
this
last
place
i
reached
on
a
sunday
night
the
fourth
or
fifth
of
july
i
thinkor
it
might
be
the
sixth
for
that
matter
inasmuch
as
i
had
been
too
much
worried
to
get
the
day
of
the
month
at
church
only
i
know
that
my
horse
and
myself
were
glad
to
come
to
a
decent
place
where
meat
and
corn
could
be
had
for
money
and
being
quite
weary
of
wandering
about
we
hoped
to
rest
there
a
little
of
this
however
we
found
no
chance
for
the
town
was
full
of
the
good
dukes
soldiers
if
men
may
be
called
so
the
half
of
whom
had
never
been
drilled
nor
had
fired
a
gun
and
it
was
rumoured
among
them
that
the
popish
army
as
they
called
it
was
to
be
attacked
that
very
night
and
with
gods
assistance
beaten
however
by
this
time
i
had
been
taught
to
pay
little
attention
to
rumours
and
having
sought
vainly
for
tom
faggus
among
these
poor
rustic
warriors
i
took
to
my
hostel
and
went
to
bed
being
as
weary
as
weary
can
be
falling
asleep
immediately
i
took
heed
of
nothing
although
the
town
was
all
alive
and
lights
had
come
glancing
as
i
lay
down
and
shouts
making
echo
all
round
my
room
but
all
i
did
was
to
bolt
the
door
not
an
inch
would
i
budge
unless
the
house
and
even
my
bed
were
on
fire
and
so
for
several
hours
i
lay
in
the
depth
of
the
deepest
slumber
without
even
a
dream
on
its
surface
until
i
was
roused
and
awakened
at
last
by
a
pushing
and
pulling
and
pinching
and
a
plucking
of
hair
out
by
the
roots
and
at
length
being
able
to
open
mine
eyes
i
saw
the
old
landlady
with
a
candle
heavily
wondering
at
me
cant
you
let
me
alone
i
grumbled
i
have
paid
for
my
bed
mistress
and
i
wont
get
up
for
any
one
would
to
god
young
man
she
answered
shaking
me
as
hard
as
ever
that
the
popish
soldiers
may
sleep
this
night
only
half
as
strong
as
thou
dost
fie
on
thee
fie
on
thee
get
up
and
go
fight
we
can
hear
the
battle
already
and
a
man
of
thy
size
mought
stop
a
cannon
i
would
rather
stop
abed
said
i
what
have
i
to
do
with
fighting
i
am
for
king
james
if
any
then
thou
mayest
even
stop
abed
the
old
woman
muttered
sulkily
a
would
never
have
laboured
half
an
hour
to
awake
a
papisher
but
hearken
you
one
thing
young
man
zummerzett
thou
art
by
thy
brogue
or
at
least
by
thy
understanding
of
it
no
zummerzett
maid
will
look
at
thee
in
spite
of
thy
size
and
stature
unless
thou
strikest
a
blow
this
night
i
lack
no
zummerzett
maid
mistress
i
have
a
fairer
than
your
brown
things
and
for
her
alone
would
i
strike
a
blow
at
this
the
old
woman
gave
me
up
as
being
beyond
correction
and
it
vexed
me
a
little
that
my
great
fame
had
not
reached
so
far
as
bridgwater
when
i
thought
that
it
went
to
bristowe
but
those
people
in
east
somerset
know
nothing
about
wrestling
devon
is
the
headquarters
of
the
art
and
devon
is
the
county
of
my
chief
love
howbeit
my
vanity
was
moved
by
this
slur
upon
itfor
i
had
told
her
my
name
was
john
ridd
when
i
had
a
gallon
of
ale
with
her
ere
ever
i
came
upstairs
and
she
had
nodded
in
such
a
manner
that
i
thought
she
knew
both
name
and
fameand
here
was
i
not
only
shaken
pinched
and
with
many
hairs
pulled
out
in
the
midst
of
my
first
good
sleep
for
a
week
but
also
abused
and
taken
amiss
and
which
vexed
me
most
of
all
unknown
now
there
is
nothing
like
vanity
to
keep
a
man
awake
at
night
however
he
be
weary
and
most
of
all
when
he
believes
that
he
is
doing
something
greatthis
time
if
never
done
beforeyet
other
people
will
not
see
except
what
they
may
laugh
at
and
so
be
far
above
him
and
sleep
themselves
the
happier
therefore
their
sleep
robs
his
own
for
all
things
play
so
in
and
out
with
the
godly
and
ungodly
ever
moving
in
a
balance
as
they
have
done
in
my
time
almost
every
year
or
two
all
things
have
such
nice
reply
of
produce
to
the
call
for
it
and
such
a
spread
across
the
world
giving
here
and
taking
there
yet
on
the
whole
pretty
even
that
haply
sleep
itself
has
but
a
certain
stock
and
keeps
in
hand
and
sells
to
flattered
which
can
pay
that
which
flattened
vanity
cannot
pay
and
will
not
sue
for
be
that
as
it
may
i
was
by
this
time
wide
awake
though
much
aggrieved
at
feeling
so
and
through
the
open
window
heard
the
distant
roll
of
musketry
and
the
beating
of
drums
with
a
quick
rubadub
and
the
come
round
the
corner
of
trumpetcall
and
perhaps
tom
faggus
might
be
there
and
shot
at
any
moment
and
my
dear
annie
left
a
poor
widow
and
my
godson
jack
an
orphan
without
a
tooth
to
help
him
therefore
i
reviled
myself
for
all
my
heavy
laziness
and
partly
through
good
honest
will
and
partly
through
the
stings
of
pride
and
yet
a
little
perhaps
by
virtue
of
a
young
mans
love
of
riot
up
i
arose
and
dressed
myself
and
woke
kickums
who
was
snoring
and
set
out
to
see
the
worst
of
it
the
sleepy
hostler
scratched
his
poll
and
could
not
tell
me
which
way
to
take
what
odds
to
him
who
was
king
or
pope
so
long
as
he
paid
his
way
and
got
a
bit
of
bacon
on
sunday
and
would
i
please
to
remember
that
i
had
roused
him
up
at
night
and
the
quality
always
made
a
point
of
paying
four
times
over
for
a
mans
loss
of
his
beautysleep
i
replied
that
his
loss
of
beautysleep
was
rather
improving
to
a
man
of
so
high
complexion
and
that
i
being
none
of
the
quality
must
pay
halfquality
prices
and
so
i
gave
him
double
fee
as
became
a
good
farmer
and
he
was
glad
to
be
quit
of
kickums
as
i
saw
by
the
turn
of
his
eye
while
going
out
at
the
archway
all
this
was
done
by
lanthorn
light
although
the
moon
was
high
and
bold
and
in
the
northern
heaven
flags
and
ribbons
of
a
jostling
pattern
such
as
we
often
have
in
autumn
but
in
july
very
rarely
of
these
master
dryden
has
spoken
somewhere
in
his
courtly
manner
but
of
him
i
think
so
littlebecause
by
fashion
preferred
to
shakespearethat
i
cannot
remember
the
passage
neither
is
it
a
credit
to
him
therefore
i
was
guided
mainly
by
the
sound
of
guns
and
trumpets
in
riding
out
of
the
narrow
ways
and
into
the
open
marshes
and
thus
i
might
have
found
my
road
in
spite
of
all
the
spread
of
water
and
the
glaze
of
moonshine
but
that
as
i
followed
sound
far
from
hedge
or
causeway
fog
like
a
chestnuttree
in
blossom
touched
with
moonlight
met
me
now
fog
is
a
thing
that
i
understand
and
can
do
with
well
enough
where
i
know
the
country
but
here
i
had
never
been
before
it
was
nothing
to
our
exmoor
fogs
not
to
be
compared
with
them
and
all
the
time
one
could
see
the
moon
which
we
cannot
do
in
our
fogs
nor
even
the
sun
for
a
week
together
yet
the
gleam
of
water
always
makes
the
fog
more
difficult
like
a
curtain
on
a
mirror
none
can
tell
the
boundaries
and
here
we
had
broadwater
patches
in
and
out
inlaid
on
land
like
motherofpearl
in
brown
shittim
wood
to
a
wild
duck
born
and
bred
there
it
would
almost
be
a
puzzle
to
find
her
own
nest
amongst
us
what
chance
then
had
i
and
kickums
both
unused
to
marsh
and
mere
each
time
when
we
thought
that
we
must
be
right
now
at
last
by
track
or
passage
and
approaching
the
conflict
with
the
sounds
of
it
waxing
nearer
suddenly
a
break
of
water
would
be
laid
before
us
with
the
moon
looking
mildly
over
it
and
the
northern
lights
behind
us
dancing
down
the
lines
of
fog
it
was
an
awful
thing
i
say
and
to
this
day
i
remember
it
to
hear
the
sounds
of
raging
fight
and
the
yells
of
raving
slayers
and
the
howls
of
poor
men
stricken
hard
and
shattered
from
wrath
to
wailing
then
suddenly
the
dead
low
hush
as
of
a
soul
departing
and
spirits
kneeling
over
it
through
the
vapour
of
the
earth
and
white
breath
of
the
water
and
beneath
the
pale
round
moon
bowing
as
the
drift
went
by
all
this
rush
and
pause
of
fear
passed
or
lingered
on
my
path
at
last
when
i
almost
despaired
of
escaping
from
this
tangle
of
spongy
banks
and
of
hazy
creeks
and
reedfringe
my
horse
heard
the
neigh
of
a
fellowhorse
and
was
only
too
glad
to
answer
it
upon
which
the
other
having
lost
its
rider
came
up
and
pricked
his
ears
at
us
and
gazed
through
the
fog
very
steadfastly
therefore
i
encouraged
him
with
a
soft
and
genial
whistle
and
kickums
did
his
best
to
tempt
him
with
a
snort
of
inquiry
however
nothing
would
suit
that
nag
except
to
enjoy
his
new
freedom
and
he
capered
away
with
his
tail
set
on
high
and
the
stirrupirons
clashing
under
him
therefore
as
he
might
know
the
way
and
appeared
to
have
been
in
the
battle
we
followed
him
very
carefully
and
he
led
us
to
a
little
hamlet
called
as
i
found
afterwards
west
zuyland
or
zealand
so
named
perhaps
from
its
situation
amid
this
inland
sea
here
the
kings
troops
had
been
quite
lately
and
their
fires
were
still
burning
but
the
men
themselves
had
been
summoned
away
by
the
night
attack
of
the
rebels
hence
i
procured
for
my
guide
a
young
man
who
knew
the
district
thoroughly
and
who
led
me
by
many
intricate
ways
to
the
rear
of
the
rebel
army
we
came
upon
a
broad
open
moor
striped
with
sullen
water
courses
shagged
with
sedge
and
yellow
iris
and
in
the
drier
part
with
bilberries
for
by
this
time
it
was
four
oclock
and
the
summer
sun
rising
wanly
showed
us
all
the
ghastly
scene
would
that
i
had
never
been
there
often
in
the
lonely
hours
even
now
it
haunts
me
would
far
more
that
the
piteous
thing
had
never
been
done
in
england
flying
men
flung
back
from
dreams
of
victory
and
honour
only
glad
to
have
the
luck
of
life
and
limbs
to
fly
with
mudbedraggled
foul
with
slime
reeking
both
with
sweat
and
blood
which
they
could
not
stop
to
wipe
cursing
with
their
pumpedout
lungs
every
stick
that
hindered
them
or
gory
puddle
that
slipped
the
step
scarcely
able
to
leap
over
the
corses
that
had
dragged
to
die
and
to
see
how
the
corses
lay
some
as
fair
as
death
in
sleep
with
the
smile
of
placid
valour
and
of
noble
manhood
hovering
yet
on
the
silent
lips
these
had
bloodless
hands
put
upwards
white
as
wax
and
firm
as
death
clasped
as
on
a
monument
in
prayer
for
dear
ones
left
behind
or
in
high
thanksgiving
and
of
these
men
there
was
nothing
in
their
broad
blue
eyes
to
fear
but
others
were
of
different
sort
simple
fellows
unused
to
pain
accustomed
to
the
billhook
perhaps
or
rasp
of
the
knuckles
in
a
quickset
hedge
or
making
some
todo
at
breakfast
over
a
thumb
cut
in
sharpening
a
scythe
and
expecting
their
wives
to
make
more
todo
yet
here
lay
these
poor
chaps
dead
dead
after
a
deal
of
pain
with
little
mind
to
bear
it
and
a
soul
they
had
never
thought
of
gone
their
god
alone
knows
whither
but
to
mercy
we
may
trust
upon
these
things
i
cannot
dwell
and
none
i
trow
would
ask
me
only
if
a
plain
man
saw
what
i
saw
that
morning
he
if
god
had
blessed
him
with
the
heart
that
is
in
most
of
us
must
have
sickened
of
all
desire
to
be
great
among
mankind
seeing
me
riding
to
the
front
where
the
work
of
death
went
on
among
the
men
of
true
english
pluck
which
when
moved
no
farther
moves
the
fugitives
called
out
to
me
in
half
a
dozen
dialects
to
make
no
utter
fool
of
myself
for
the
great
guns
were
come
and
the
fight
was
over
all
the
rest
was
slaughter

desiring
not

for

and
eager
to
aid
some
poor
sick
people
who
tried
to
lift
their
arms
to
me
and
this
i
did
to
the

of
my

sat
up

ebbing
and
with
slow
insistence
urged
me
when
his
broken
voice
would
come
to
tell
his
wife
whose
name
i
knew
not
something
about
an
appletree
and
a
golden
guinea
stored
in
it
to
divide
among
six
childrenin
the
midst
of
this
i
felt
warm
lips
laid
against
my
cheek
quite
softly
and
then
a
little
push
and
behold
it
was
a
horse
leaning
over
me
i
arose
in
haste
and
there
stood
winnie
looking
at
me
with
beseeching
eyes
enough
to
melt
a
heart
of
stone
then
seeing
my
attention
fixed
she
turned
her
head
and
glanced
back
sadly
toward
the
place
of
battle
and
gave
a
little
wistful
neigh
and
then
looked
me
full
in
the
face
again
as
much
as
to
say
do
you
understand
while
she
scraped
with
one
hoof
impatiently
if
ever
a
horse
tried
hard
to
speak
it
was
winnie
at
that
moment
i
went
to
her
side
and
patted
her
but
that
was
not
what
she
wanted
then
i
offered
to
leap
into
the
empty
saddle
but
neither
did
that
seem
good
to
her
for
she
ran
away
toward
the
part
of
the
field
at
which
she
had
been
glancing
back
and
then
turned
round
and
shook
her
mane
entreating
me
to
follow
her
upon
this
i
learned
from
the
dying
man
where
to
find
his
appletree
and
promised
to
add
another
guinea
to
the
one
in
store
for
his
children
and
so
commending
him
to
god
i
mounted
my
own
horse
again
and
to
winnies
great
delight
professed
myself
at
her
service
with
her
ringing
silvery
neigh
such
as
no
other
horse
of
all
i
ever
knew
could
equal
she
at
once
proclaimed
her
triumph
and
told
her
master
or
meant
to
tell
if
death
should
not
have
closed
his
ears
that
she
was
coming
to
his
aid
and
bringing
one
who
might
be
trusted
of
the
higher
race
that
kill
a
cannonbullet
fired
low
and
ploughing
the
marsh
slowly
met
poor
winnie
front
to
front
and
she
being
as
quick
as
thought
lowered
her
nose
to
sniff
at
it
it
might
be
a
message
from
her
master
for
it
made
a
mournful
noise
but
luckily
for
winnies
life
a
rise
of
wet
ground
took
the
ball
even
under
her
very
nose
and
there
it
cut
a
splashy
groove
missing
her
off
hindfoot
by
an
inch
and
scattering
black
mud
over
her
it
frightened
me
much
more
than
winnie
of
that
i
am
quite
certain
because
though
i
am
firm
enough
when
it
comes
to
a
real
tussle
and
the
heart
of
a
fellow
warms
up
and
tells
him
that
he
must
go
through
with
it
yet
i
never
did
approve
of
making
a
cold
pie
of
death
therefore
with
those
reckless
cannons
brazenmouthed
and
bellowing
two
furlongs
off
or
it
might
be
more
and
the
more
the
merrier
i
would
have
given
that
years
haycrop
for
a
bit
of
a
hill
or
a
thicket
of
oaks
or
almost
even
a
badgers
earth
people
will
call
me
a
coward
for
this
especially
when
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
life
was
not
worth
having
without
any
sign
of
lorna
nevertheless
i
cannot
help
it
those
were
my
feelings
and
i
set
them
down
because
they
made
a
mark
on
me
at
glen
doone
i
had
fought
even
against
cannon
with
some
spirit
and
fury
but
now
i
saw
nothing
to
fight
about
but
rather
in
every
poor
doubled
corpse
a
good
reason
for
not
fighting
so
in
cold
blood
riding
on
and
yet
ashamed
that
a
man
should
shrink
where
a
horse
went
bravely
i
cast
a
bitter
blame
upon
the
reckless
ways
of
winnie
nearly
all
were
scattered
now
of
the
noble
countrymen
armed
with
scythe
or
pickaxe
blacksmiths
hammer
or
foldpitcher
who
had
stood
their
ground
for
hours
against
blazing
musketry
from
men
whom
they
could
not
get
at
by
reason
of
the
waterdyke
and
then
against
the
deadly
cannon
dragged
by
the
bishops
horses
to
slaughter
his
own
sheep
of
these
sturdy
englishmen
noble
in
their
want
of
sense
scarce
one
out
of
four
remained
for
the
cowards
to
shoot
down
cross
the
rhaine
they
shouted
out
cross
the
rhaine
and
coom
within
rache
but
the
other
mongrel
britons
with
a
mongrel
at
their
head
found
it
pleasanter
to
shoot
men
who
could
not
shoot
in
answer
than
to
meet
the
chance
of
mischief
from
strong
arms
and
stronger
hearts
the
last
scene
of
this
piteous
play
was
acting
just
as
i
rode
up
broad
daylight
and
upstanding
sun
winnowing
fog
from
the
eastern
hills
and
spreading
the
moors
with
freshness
all
along
the
dykes
they
shone
glistened
on
the
willowtrunks
and
touched
the
banks
with
a
hoary
gray
but
alas
those
banks
were
touched
more
deeply
with
a
gory
red
and
strewn
with
fallen
trunks
more
woeful
than
the
wreck
of
trees
while
howling
cursing
yelling
and
the
loathsome
reek
of
carnage
drowned
the
scent
of
the
newmown
hay
and
the
carol
of
the
lark
then
the
cavalry
of
the
king
with
their
horses
at
full
speed
dashed
from
either
side
upon
the
helpless
mob
of
countrymen
a
few
pikes
feebly
levelled
met
them
but
they
shot
the
pikemen
drew
swords
and
helterskelter
leaped
into
the
shattered
and
scattering
mass
right
and
left
they
hacked
and
hewed
i
could
hear
the
snapping
of
scythes
beneath
them
and
see
the
flash
of
their
sweeping
swords
how
it
must
end
was
plain
enough
even
to
one
like
myself
who
had
never
beheld
such
a
battle
before
but
winnie
led
me
away
to
the
left
and
as
i
could
not
help
the
people
neither
stop
the
slaughter
but
found
the
cannonbullets
coming
very
rudely
nigh
me
i
was
only
too
glad
to
follow
her
chapter
lxv
falling
among
lambs
that
faithful
creature
whom
i
began
to
admire
as
if
she
were
my
own
which
is
no
little
thing
for
a
man
to
say
of
another
mans
horse
stopped
in
front
of
a
low
black
shed
such
as
we
call
a
linhay
and
here
she
uttered
a
little
greeting
in
a
subdued
and
softened
voice
hoping
to
obtain
an
answer
such
as
her
master
was
wont
to
give
in
a
cheery
manner
receiving
no
reply
she
entered
and
i
who
could
scarce
keep
up
with
her
poor
kickums
being
weary
leaped
from
his
back
and
followed
there
i
found
her
sniffing
gently
but
with
great
emotion
at
the
body
of
tom
faggus
a
corpse
poor
tom
appeared
to
be
if
ever
there
was
one
in
this
world
and
i
turned
away
and
felt
unable
to
keep
altogether
from
weeping
but
the
mare
either
could
not
understand
or
else
would
not
believe
it
she
reached
her
long
neck
forth
and
felt
him
with
her
under
lip
passing
it
over
his
skin
as
softly
as
a
mother
would
do
to
an
infant
and
then
she
looked
up
at
me
again
as
much
as
to
say
he
is
all
right
upon
this
i
took
courage
and
handled
poor
tom
which
being
young
i
had
feared
at
first
to
do
he
groaned
very
feebly
as
i
raised
him
up
and
there
was
the
wound
a
great
savage
one
whether
from
pikethrust
or
musketball
gaping
and
welling
in
his
right
side
from
which
a
piece
seemed
to
be
torn
away
i
bound
it
up
with
some
of
my
linen
so
far
as
i
knew
how
just
to
stanch
the
flow
of
blood
until
we
could
get
a
doctor
then
i
gave
him
a
little
weak
brandy
and
water
which
he
drank
with
the
greatest
eagerness
and
made
sign
to
me
for
more
of
it
but
not
knowing
how
far
it
was
right
to
give
cordial
under
the
circumstances
i
handed
him
unmixed
water
that
time
thinking
that
he
was
too
far
gone
to
perceive
the
difference
but
herein
i
wrong
tom
faggus
for
he
shook
his
head
and
frowned
at
me
even
at
the
door
of
death
he
would
not
drink
what
adam
drank
by
whom
came
death
into
the
world
so
i
gave
him
a
little
more
eaudevie
and
he
took
it
most
submissively
after
that
he
seemed
better
and
a
little
colour
came
into
his
cheeks
and
he
looked
at
winnie
and
knew
her
and
would
have
her
nose
in
his
clammy
hand
though
i
thought
it
not
good
for
either
of
them
with
the
stay
of
my
arm
he
sat
upright
and
faintly
looked
about
him
as
if
at
the
end
of
a
violent
dream
too
much
for
his
power
of
mind
then
he
managed
to
whisper
is
winnie
hurt
as
sound
as
a
roach
i
answered
then
so
am
i
said
he
put
me
upon
her
back
john
she
and
i
die
together
surprised
as
i
was
at
this
fatalism
for
so
it
appeared
to
me
of
which
he
had
often
shown
symptoms
before
but
i
took
them
for
mere
levity
now
i
knew
not
what
to
do
for
it
seemed
to
me
a
murderous
thing
to
set
such
a
man
on
horseback
where
he
must
surely
bleed
to
death
even
if
he
could
keep
the
saddle
but
he
told
me
with
many
breaks
and
pauses
that
unless
i
obeyed
his
orders
he
would
tear
off
all
my
bandages
and
accept
no
further
aid
from
me
while
i
was
yet
hesitating
a
storm
of
horse
at
full
gallop
went
by
tearing
swearing
bearing
away
all
the
country
before
them
only
a
little
pollard
hedge
kept
us
from
their
bloodshot
eyes
now
is
the
time
said
my
cousin
tom
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
his
words
on
their
heels
i
am
safe
john
if
i
have
only
winnie
under
me
winnie
and
i
die
together
seeing
this
strong
bent
of
his
mind
stronger
than
any
pains
of
death
i
even
did
what
his
feeble
eyes
sometimes
implored
and
sometimes
commanded
with
a
strong
sash
from
his
own
hot
neck
bound
and
twisted
tight
as
wax
around
his
damaged
waist
i
set
him
upon
winnies
back
and
placed
his
trembling
feet
in
stirrups
with
a
band
from
one
to
another
under
the
good
mares
body
so
that
no
swerve
could
throw
him
out
and
then
i
said
lean
forward
tom
it
will
stop
your
hurt
from
bleeding
he
leaned
almost
on
the
neck
of
the
mare
which
as
i
knew
must
close
the
wound
and
the
light
of
his
eyes
was
quite
different
and
the
pain
of
his
forehead
unstrung
itself
as
if
he
felt
the
undulous
readiness
of
her
volatile
paces
under
him
god
bless
you
john
i
am
safe
he
whispered
fearing
to
open
his
lungs
much
who
can
come
near
my
winnie
mare
a
mile
of
her
gallop
is
ten
years
of
life
look
out
for
yourself
john
ridd
he
sucked
his
lips
and
the
mare
went
off
as
easy
and
swift
as
a
swallow
well
thought
i
as
i
looked
at
kickums
ignobly
cropping
up
a
bit
of
grass
i
have
done
a
very
good
thing
no
doubt
and
ought
to
be
thankful
to
god
for
the
chance
but
as
for
getting
away
unharmed
with
all
these
scoundrels
about
me
and
only
a
foundered
horse
to
trust
ingood
and
spiteful
as
he
isupon
the
whole
i
begin
to
think
that
i
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
according
to
my
habit
no
wonder
tom
said
look
out
for
yourself
i
shall
look
out
from
a
prison
window
or
perhaps
even
out
of
a
halter
and
then
what
will
lorna
think
of
me
being
in
this
wistful
mood
i
resolved
to
abide
awhile
even
where
fate
had
thrown
me
for
my
horse
required
good
rest
no
doubt
and
was
taking
it
even
while
he
cropped
with
his
hind
legs
far
away
stretched
out
and
his
forelegs
gathered
under
him
and
his
muzzle
on
the
molehills
so
that
he
had
five
supportings
from
his
mother
earth
moreover
the
linhay
itself
was
full
of
very
ancient
cow
dung
than
which
there
is
no
balmier
and
more
maiden
soporific
hence
i
resolved
upon
the
whole
though
grieving
about
breakfast
to
light
a
pipe
and
go
to
sleep
or
at
least
until
the
hot
sun
should
arouse
the
flies
i
may
have
slept
three
hours
or
four
or
it
might
be
even
fivefor
i
never
counted
time
while
sleepingwhen
a
shaking
more
rude
than
the
old
landladys
brought
me
back
to
the
world
again
i
looked
up
with
a
mighty
yawn
and
saw
twenty
or
so
of
footsoldiers
this
linhay
is
not
yours
i
said
when
they
had
quite
aroused
me
with
tongue
and
hand
and
even
swordprick
what
business
have
you
here
good
fellows
business
bad
for
you
said
one
and
will
lead
you
to
the
gallows
do
you
wish
to
know
the
way
out
again
i
asked
very
quietly
as
being
no
braggadocio
we
will
show
thee
the
way
out
said
one
and
the
way
out
of
the
world
said
another
but
not
the
way
to
heaven
said
one
chap
most
unlikely
to
know
it
and
thereupon
they
all
fell
wagging
like
a
bed
of
clover
leaves
in
the
morning
at
their
own
choice
humour
will
you
pile
your
arms
outside
i
said
and
try
a
bit
of
fair
play
with
me
for
i
disliked
these
men
sincerely
and
was
fain
to
teach
them
a
lesson
they
were
so
unchristian
in
appearance
having
faces
of
a
coffee
colour
and
dirty
beards
half
over
them
moreover
their
dress
was
outrageous
and
their
address
still
worse
however
i
had
wiser
let
them
alone
as
will
appear
afterwards
these
savagelooking
fellows
laughed
at
the
idea
of
my
having
any
chance
against
some
twenty
of
them
but
i
knew
that
the
place
was
in
my
favour
for
my
part
of
it
had
been
fenced
off
for
weaning
a
calf
most
likely
so
that
only
two
could
come
at
me
at
once
and
i
must
be
very
much
out
of
training
if
i
could
not
manage
two
of
them
therefore
i
laid
aside
my
carbine
and
the
two
horsepistols
and
they
with
many
coarse
jokes
at
me
went
a
little
way
outside
and
set
their
weapons
against
the
wall
and
turned
up
their
coat
sleeves
jauntily
and
then
began
to
hesitate
go
you
first
bob
i
heard
them
say
you
are
the
biggest
man
of
us
and
dick
the
wrestler
along
of
you
us
will
back
you
up
boy
ill
warrant
ill
draw
the
badger
said
bob
and
not
a
tooth
will
i
leave
him
but
mind
for
the
honour
of
kirkes
lambs
every
man
stands
me
a
glass
of
gin
then
he
and
another
man
made
a
rush
and
the
others
came
doublequickmarch
on
their
heels
but
as
bob
ran
at
me
most
stupidly
not
even
knowing
how
to
place
his
hands
i
caught
him
with
my
knuckles
at
the
back
of
his
neck
and
with
all
the
sway
of
my
right
arm
sent
him
over
the
heads
of
his
comrades
meanwhile
dick
the
wrestler
had
grappled
me
expecting
to
show
off
his
art
of
which
indeed
he
had
some
small
knowledge
but
being
quite
of
the
lightweights
in
a
second
he
was
flying
after
his
companion
bob
now
these
two
men
were
hurt
so
badly
the
light
one
having
knocked
his
head
against
the
lintel
of
the
outer
gate
that
the
rest
had
no
desire
to
encounter
the
like
misfortune
so
they
hung
back
whispering
and
before
they
had
made
up
their
minds
i
rushed
into
the
midst
of
them
the
suddenness
and
the
weight
of
my
onset
took
them
wholly
by
surprise
and
for
once
in
their
lives
perhaps
kirkes
lambs
were
worthy
of
their
name
like
a
flock
of
sheep
at
a
dogs
attack
they
fell
away
hustling
one
another
and
my
only
difficulty
was
not
to
tumble
over
them
i
had
taken
my
carbine
out
with
me
having
a
fondness
for
it
but
the
two
horsepistols
i
left
behind
and
therefore
felt
good
title
to
take
two
from
the
magazine
of
the
lambs
and
with
these
and
my
carbine
i
leaped
upon
kickums
who
was
now
quite
glad
of
a
gallop
again
and
i
bade
adieu
to
that
mongrel
lot
yet
they
had
the
meanness
to
shoot
at
me
thanking
god
for
my
deliverance
inasmuch
as
those
men
would
have
strung
me
up
from
a
pollardash
without
trial
as
i
heard
them
tell
one
another
and
saw
the
tree
they
had
settled
upon
i
ventured
to
go
rather
fast
on
my
way
with
doubt
and
uneasiness
urging
me
and
now
my
way
was
home
again
nobody
could
say
but
what
i
had
done
my
duty
and
rescued
tom
if
he
could
be
rescued
from
the
mischief
into
which
his
own
perverseness
and
love
of
change
rather
than
deep
religious
convictions
to
which
our
annie
ascribed
his
outbreak
had
led
or
seemed
likely
to
lead
him
and
how
proud
would
my
mother
be
andah
well
there
was
nobody
else
to
be
proud
of
me
now
but
while
thinking
these
things
and
desiring
my
breakfast
beyond
any
power
of
describing
and
even
beyond
my
remembrance
i
fell
into
another
fold
of
lambs
from
which
there
was
no
exit
these
like
true
crusaders
met
me
swaggering
very
heartily
and
with
their
barrels
of
cider
set
like
so
many
cannon
across
the
road
over
against
a
small
hostel
we
have
won
the
victory
my
lord
king
and
we
mean
to
enjoy
it
down
from
thy
horse
and
have
a
stoup
of
cider
thou
big
rebel
no
rebel
am
i
my
name
is
john
ridd
i
belong
to
the
side
of
the
king
and
i
want
some
breakfast
these
fellows
were
truly
hospitable
that
much
will
i
say
for
them
being
accustomed
to
arab
ways
they
could
toss
a
grill
or
fritter
or
the
inner
meaning
of
an
egg
into
any
form
they
pleased
comely
and
very
good
to
eat
and
it
led
me
to
think
of
annie
so
i
made
the
rarest
breakfast
any
man
might
hope
for
after
all
his
troubles
and
getting
on
with
these
brown
fellows
better
than
could
be
expected
i
craved
permission
to
light
a
pipe
if
not
disagreeable
hearing
this
they
roared
at
me
with
a
superior
laughter
and
asked
me
whether
or
not
i
knew
the
tobaccoleaf
from
the
chickweed
and
when
i
was
forced
to
answer
no
not
having
gone
into
the
subject
but
being
content
with
anything
brown
they
clapped
me
on
the
back
and
swore
they
had
never
seen
any
one
like
me
upon
the
whole
this
pleased
me
much
for
i
do
not
wish
to
be
taken
always
as
of
the
common
pattern
and
so
we
smoked
admirable
tobaccofor
they
would
not
have
any
of
mine
though
very
courteous
concerning
itand
i
was
beginning
to
understand
a
little
of
what
they
told
me
when
up
came
those
confounded
lambs
who
had
shown
more
tail
than
head
to
me
in
the
linhay
as
i
mentioned
now
these
men
upset
everything
having
been
among
wrestlers
so
much
as
my
duty
compelled
me
to
be
and
having
learned
the
necessity
of
the
rest
which
follows
the
conflict
and
the
right
of
discussion
which
all
people
have
to
pay
their
sixpence
to
enter
and
how
they
obtrude
this
right
and
their
wisdom
upon
the
man
who
has
laboured
until
he
forgets
all
the
work
he
did
and
begins
to
think
that
they
did
it
having
some
knowledge
of
this
sort
of
thing
and
the
flux
of
minds
swimming
in
liquor
i
foresaw
a
brawl
as
plainly
as
if
it
were
bear
street
in
barnstaple
and
a
brawl
there
was
without
any
error
except
of
the
men
who
hit
their
friends
and
those
who
defended
their
enemies
my
partners
in
breakfast
and
beercan
swore
that
i
was
no
prisoner
but
the
best
and
most
loyal
subject
and
the
finesthearted
fellow
they
had
ever
the
luck
to
meet
with
whereas
the
men
from
the
linhay
swore
that
i
was
a
rebel
miscreant
and
have
me
they
would
with
a
ropesend
ready
in
spite
of
every
violent
language
who
had
got
drunk
at
my
expense
and
been
misled
by
my
strong
word
lies
while
this
fight
was
going
on
and
its
mere
occurrence
shows
perhaps
that
my
conversation
in
those
days
was
not
entirely
despicableelse
why
should
my
new
friends
fight
for
me
when
i
had
paid
for
the
ale
and
therefore
won
the
wrong
tense
of
gratitude
it
was
in
my
power
at
any
moment
to
take
horse
and
go
and
this
would
have
been
my
wisest
plan
and
a
very
great
saving
of
money
but
somehow
i
felt
as
if
it
would
be
a
mean
thing
to
slip
off
so
even
while
i
was
hesitating
and
the
men
were
breaking
each
others
heads
a
superior
officer
rode
up
with
his
sword
drawn
and
his
face
on
fire
what
my
lambs
my
lambs
he
cried
smiting
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
is
this
how
you
waste
my
time
and
my
purse
when
you
ought
to
be
catching
a
hundred
prisoners
worth
ten
pounds
apiece
to
me
who
is
this
young
fellow
we
have
here
speak
up
sirrah
what
art
thou
and
how
much
will
thy
good
mother
pay
for
thee
my
mother
will
pay
naught
for
me
i
answered
while
the
lambs
fell
back
and
glowered
at
one
another
so
please
your
worship
i
am
no
rebel
but
an
honest
farmer
and
wellproved
of
loyalty
ha
ha
a
farmer
art
thou
those
fellows
always
pay
the
best
good
farmer
come
to
yon
barren
tree
thou
shalt
make
it
fruitful
colonel
kirke
made
a
sign
to
his
men
and
before
i
could
think
of
resistance
stout
new
ropes
were
flung
around
me
and
with
three
men
on
either
side
i
was
led
along
very
painfully
and
now
i
saw
and
repented
deeply
of
my
careless
folly
in
stopping
with
those
booncompanions
instead
of
being
far
away
but
the
newness
of
their
manners
to
me
and
their
mode
of
regarding
the
world
differing
so
much
from
mine
own
as
well
as
the
flavour
of
their
tobacco
had
made
me
quite
forget
my
duty
to
the
farm
and
to
myself
yet
methought
they
would
be
tender
to
me
after
all
our
speeches
how
then
was
i
disappointed
when
the
men
who
had
drunk
my
beer
drew
on
those
grievous
ropes
twice
as
hard
as
the
men
i
had
been
at
strife
with
yet
this
may
have
been
from
no
ill
will
but
simply
that
having
fallen
under
suspicion
of
laxity
they
were
compelled
in
selfdefence
now
to
be
overzealous
nevertheless
however
pure
and
godly
might
be
their
motives
i
beheld
myself
in
a
grievous
case
and
likely
to
get
the
worst
of
it
for
the
face
of
the
colonel
was
hard
and
stern
as
a
block
of
bogwood
oak
and
though
the
men
might
pity
me
and
think
me
unjustly
executed
yet
they
must
obey
their
orders
or
themselves
be
put
to
death
therefore
i
addressed
myself
to
the
colonel
in
a
most
ingratiating
manner
begging
him
not
to
sully
the
glory
of
his
victory
and
dwelling
upon
my
pure
innocence
and
even
good
service
to
our
lord
the
king
but
colonel
kirke
only
gave
command
that
i
should
be
smitten
in
the
mouth
which
office
bob
whom
i
had
flung
so
hard
out
of
the
linhay
performed
with
great
zeal
and
efficiency
but
being
aware
of
the
coming
smack
i
thrust
forth
a
pair
of
teeth
upon
which
the
knuckles
of
my
good
friend
made
a
melancholy
shipwreck
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
tell
half
the
thoughts
that
moved
me
when
we
came
to
the
fatal
tree
and
saw
two
men
hanging
there
already
as
innocent
perhaps
as
i
was
and
henceforth
entirely
harmless
though
ordered
by
the
colonel
to
look
steadfastly
upon
them
i
could
not
bear
to
do
so
upon
which
he
called
me
a
paltry
coward
and
promised
my
breeches
to
any
man
who
would
spit
upon
my
countenance
this
vile
thing
bob
being
angered
perhaps
by
the
smarting
wound
of
his
knuckles
bravely
stepped
forward
to
do
for
me
trusting
no
doubt
to
the
rope
i
was
led
with
but
unluckily
as
it
proved
for
him
my
right
arm
was
free
for
a
moment
and
therewith
i
dealt
him
such
a
blow
that
he
never
spake
again
for
this
thing
i
have
often
grieved
but
the
provocation
was
very
sore
to
the
pride
of
a
young
man
and
i
trust
that
god
has
forgiven
me
at
the
sound
and
sight
of
that
bitter
stroke
the
other
men
drew
back
and
colonel
kirke
now
black
in
the
face
with
fury
and
vexation
gave
orders
for
to
shoot
me
and
cast
me
into
the
ditch
hard
by
the
men
raised
their
pieces
and
pointed
at
me
waiting
for
the
word
to
fire
and
i
being
quite
overcome
by
the
hurry
of
these
events
and
quite
unprepared
to
die
yet
could
only
think
all
upside
down
about
lorna
and
my
mother
and
wonder
what
each
would
say
to
it
i
spread
my
hands
before
my
eyes
not
being
so
brave
as
some
men
and
hoping
in
some
foolish
way
to
cover
my
heart
with
my
elbows
i
heard
the
breath
of
all
around
as
if
my
skull
were
a
soundingboard
and
knew
even
how
the
different
men
were
fingering
their
triggers
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
all
over
me
as
the
colonel
prolonging
his
enjoyment
began
slowly
to
say
fire
but
while
he
was
yet
dwelling
on
the
f
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
dashed
out
on
the
road
and
horse
and
horseman
flung
themselves
betwixt
me
and
the
gun
muzzles
so
narrowly
was
i
saved
that
one
man
could
not
check
his
trigger
his
musket
went
off
and
the
ball
struck
the
horse
on
the
withers
and
scared
him
exceedingly
he
began
to
lash
out
with
his
heels
all
around
and
the
colonel
was
glad
to
keep
clear
of
him
and
the
men
made
excuse
to
lower
their
guns
not
really
wishing
to
shoot
me
how
now
captain
stickles
cried
kirke
the
more
angry
because
he
had
shown
his
cowardice
dare
you
sir
to
come
betwixt
me
and
my
lawful
prisoner
nay
hearken
one
moment
colonel
replied
my
old
friend
jeremy
and
his
damaged
voice
was
the
sweetest
sound
i
had
heard
for
many
a
day
for
your
own
sake
hearken
he
looked
so
full
of
momentous
tidings
that
colonel
kirke
made
a
sign
to
his
men
not
to
shoot
me
till
further
orders
and
then
he
went
aside
with
stickles
so
that
in
spite
of
all
my
anxiety
i
could
not
catch
what
passed
between
them
but
i
fancied
that
the
name
of
the
lord
chiefjustice
jeffreys
was
spoken
more
than
once
and
with
emphasis
and
deference
then
i
leave
him
in
your
hands
captain
stickles
said
kirke
at
last
so
that
all
might
hear
him
and
though
the
news
was
good
for
me
the
smile
of
baffled
malice
made
his
dark
face
look
most
hideous
and
i
shall
hold
you
answerable
for
the
custody
of
this
prisoner
colonel
kirke
i
will
answer
for
him
master
stickles
replied
with
a
grave
bow
and
one
hand
on
his
breast
john
ridd
you
are
my
prisoner
follow
me
john
ridd
upon
that
those
precious
lambs
flocked
away
leaving
the
rope
still
around
me
and
some
were
glad
and
some
were
sorry
not
to
see
me
swinging
being
free
of
my
arms
again
i
touched
my
hat
to
colonel
kirke
as
became
his
rank
and
experience
but
he
did
not
condescend
to
return
my
short
salutation
having
espied
in
the
distance
a
prisoner
out
of
whom
he
might
make
money
i
wrung
the
hand
of
jeremy
stickles
for
his
truth
and
goodness
and
he
almost
wept
for
since
his
wound
he
had
been
a
weakened
man
as
he
answered
turn
for
turn
john
you
saved
my
life
from
the
doones
and
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
have
saved
you
from
a
far
worse
company
let
your
sister
annie
know
it
chapter
lxvi
suitable
devotion
now
kickums
was
not
like
winnie
any
more
than
a
man
is
like
a
woman
and
so
he
had
not
followed
my
fortunes
except
at
his
own
distance
no
doubt
but
what
he
felt
a
certain
interest
in
me
but
his
interest
was
not
devotion
and
man
might
go
his
way
and
be
hanged
rather
than
horse
would
meet
hardship
therefore
seeing
things
to
be
bad
and
his
master
involved
in
trouble
what
did
this
horse
do
but
start
for
the
ease
and
comfort
of
plovers
barrows
and
the
plentiful
ration
of
oats
abiding
in
his
own
manger
for
this
i
do
not
blame
him
it
is
the
manner
of
mankind
but
i
could
not
help
being
very
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
my
mothers
discomfort
and
worry
when
she
should
spy
this
good
horse
coming
home
without
any
master
or
rider
and
i
almost
hoped
that
he
might
be
caught
although
he
was
worth
at
least
twenty
pounds
by
some
of
the
kings
troopers
rather
than
find
his
way
home
and
spread
distress
among
our
people
yet
knowing
his
nature
i
doubted
if
any
could
catch
or
catching
would
keep
him
jeremy
stickles
assured
me
as
we
took
the
road
to
bridgwater
that
the
only
chance
for
my
life
if
i
still
refused
to
fly
was
to
obtain
an
order
forthwith
for
my
despatch
to
london
as
a
suspected
person
indeed
but
not
found
in
open
rebellion
and
believed
to
be
under
the
patronage
of
the
great
lord
jeffreys
for
said
he
in
a
few
hours
time
you
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
lord
feversham
who
has
won
this
fight
without
seeing
it
and
who
has
returned
to
bed
again
to
have
his
breakfast
more
comfortably
now
he
may
not
be
quite
so
savage
perhaps
as
colonel
kirke
nor
find
so
much
sport
in
gibbeting
but
he
is
equally
pitiless
and
his
price
no
doubt
would
be
higher
i
will
pay
no
price
whatever
i
answered
neither
will
i
fly
an
hour
agone
i
would
have
fled
for
the
sake
of
my
mother
and
the
farm
but
now
that
i
have
been
taken
prisoner
and
my
name
is
known
if
i
fly
the
farm
is
forfeited
and
my
mother
and
sister
must
starve
moreover
i
have
done
no
harm
i
have
borne
no
weapons
against
the
king
nor
desired
the
success
of
his
enemies
i
like
not
that
the
son
of
a
bonaroba
should
be
king
of
england
neither
do
i
count
the
papists
any
worse
than
we
are
if
they
have
aught
to
try
me
for
i
will
stand
my
trial
then
to
london
thou
must
go
my
son
there
is
no
such
thing
as
trial
here
we
hang
the
good
folk
without
it
which
saves
them
much
anxiety
but
quicken
thy
step
good
john
i
have
influence
with
lord
churchill
and
we
must
contrive
to
see
him
ere
the
foreigner
falls
to
work
again
lord
churchill
is
a
man
of
sense
and
imprisons
nothing
but
his
money
we
were
lucky
enough
to
find
this
nobleman
who
has
since
become
so
famous
by
his
foreign
victories
he
received
us
with
great
civility
and
looked
at
me
with
much
interest
being
a
tall
and
fine
young
man
himself
but
not
to
compare
with
me
in
size
although
far
better
favoured
i
liked
his
face
well
enough
but
thought
there
was
something
false
about
it
he
put
me
a
few
keen
questions
such
as
a
man
not
assured
of
honesty
might
have
found
hard
to
answer
and
he
stood
in
a
very
upright
attitude
making
the
most
of
his
figure
i
saw
nothing
to
be
proud
of
at
the
moment
in
this
interview
but
since
the
great
duke
of
marlborough
rose
to
the
top
of
glory
i
have
tried
to
remember
more
about
him
than
my
conscience
quite
backs
up
how
should
i
know
that
this
man
would
be
foremost
of
our
kingdom
in
fiveandtwenty
years
or
so
and
not
knowing
why
should
i
heed
him
except
for
my
own
pocket
nevertheless
i
have
been
so
crossquestionedfar
worse
than
by
young
lord
churchillabout
his
grace
the
duke
of
marlborough
and
what
he
said
to
me
and
what
i
said
then
and
how
his
grace
replied
to
that
and
whether
he
smiled
like
another
man
or
screwed
up
his
lips
like
a
button
as
our
parish
tailor
said
of
him
and
whether
i
knew
from
the
turn
of
his
nose
that
no
frenchman
could
stand
before
him
all
these
inquiries
have
worried
me
so
ever
since
the
battle
of
blenheim
that
if
tailors
would
only
print
upon
waistcoats
i
would
give
double
price
for
a
vest
bearing
this
inscription
no
information
can
be
given
about
the
duke
of
marlborough
now
this
good
lord
churchillfor
one
might
call
him
good
by
comparison
with
the
very
bad
people
around
himgranted
without
any
long
hesitation
the
order
for
my
safe
deliverance
to
the
court
of
kings
bench
at
westminster
and
stickles
who
had
to
report
in
london
was
empowered
to
convey
me
and
made
answerable
for
producing
me
this
arrangement
would
have
been
entirely
to
my
liking
although
the
time
of
year
was
bad
for
leaving
plovers
barrows
so
but
no
man
may
quite
choose
his
times
and
on
the
while
i
would
have
been
quite
content
to
visit
london
if
my
mother
could
be
warned
that
nothing
was
amiss
with
me
only
a
mild
and
as
one
might
say
nominal
captivity
and
to
prevent
her
anxiety
i
did
my
best
to
send
a
letter
through
good
sergeant
bloxham
of
whom
i
heard
as
quartered
with
dumbartons
regiment
at
chedzuy
but
that
regiment
was
away
in
pursuit
and
i
was
forced
to
entrust
my
letter
to
a
man
who
said
that
he
knew
him
and
accepted
a
shilling
to
see
to
it
for
fear
of
any
unpleasant
change
we
set
forth
at
once
for
london
and
truly
thankful
may
i
be
that
god
in
his
mercy
spared
me
the
sight
of
the
cruel
and
bloody
work
with
which
the
whole
country
reeked
and
howled
during
the
next
fortnight
i
have
heard
things
that
set
my
hair
on
end
and
made
me
loathe
good
meat
for
days
but
i
make
a
point
of
setting
down
only
the
things
which
i
saw
done
and
in
this
particular
case
not
many
will
quarrel
with
my
decision
enough
therefore
that
we
rode
on
for
stickles
had
found
me
a
horse
at
last
as
far
as
wells
where
we
slept
that
night
and
being
joined
in
the
morning
by
several
troopers
and
orderlies
we
made
a
slow
but
safe
journey
to
london
by
way
of
bath
and
reading
the
sight
of
london
warmed
my
heart
with
various
emotions
such
as
a
cordial
man
must
draw
from
the
heart
of
all
humanity
here
there
are
quick
ways
and
manners
and
the
rapid
sense
of
knowledge
and
the
power
of
understanding
ere
a
word
be
spoken
whereas
at
oare
you
must
say
a
thing
three
times
very
slowly
before
it
gets
inside
the
skull
of
the
good
man
you
are
addressing
and
yet
we
are
far
more
clever
there
than
in
any
parish
for
fifteen
miles
but
what
moved
me
most
when
i
saw
again
the
noble
oil
and
tallow
of
the
london
lights
and
the
dripping
torches
at
almost
every
corner
and
the
handsome
signboards
was
the
thought
that
here
my
lorna
lived
and
walked
and
took
the
air
and
perhaps
thought
now
and
then
of
the
old
days
in
the
good
farmhouse
although
i
would
make
no
approach
to
her
any
more
than
she
had
done
to
me
upon
which
grief
i
have
not
dwelt
for
fear
of
seeming
selfish
yet
there
must
be
some
large
chance
or
the
little
chance
might
be
enlarged
of
falling
in
with
the
maiden
somehow
and
learning
how
her
mind
was
set
if
against
me
all
should
be
over
i
was
not
the
man
to
sigh
and
cry
for
love
like
a
romeo
none
should
even
guess
my
grief
except
my
sister
annie
but
if
lorna
loved
me
stillas
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
hopedthen
would
i
for
no
one
care
except
her
own
delicious
self
rank
and
title
wealth
and
grandeur
all
should
go
to
the
winds
before
they
scared
me
from
my
own
true
love
thinking
thus
i
went
to
bed
in
the
centre
of
london
town
and
was
bitten
so
grievously
by
creatures
whose
name
is
legion
mad
with
the
delight
of
getting
a
wholesome
farmer
among
them
that
verily
i
was
ashamed
to
walk
in
the
courtly
parts
of
the
town
next
day
having
lumps
upon
my
face
of
the
size
of
a
pickling
walnut
the
landlord
said
that
this
was
nothing
and
that
he
expected
in
two
days
at
the
utmost
a
very
fresh
young
irishman
for
whom
they
would
all
forsake
me
nevertheless
i
declined
to
wait
unless
he
could
find
me
a
hayrick
to
sleep
in
for
the
insects
of
grass
only
tickle
he
assured
me
that
no
hayrick
could
now
be
found
in
london
upon
which
i
was
forced
to
leave
him
and
with
mutual
esteem
we
parted
the
next
night
i
had
better
luck
being
introduced
to
a
decent
widow
of
very
high
scotch
origin
that
house
was
swept
and
garnished
so
that
not
a
bit
was
left
to
eat
for
either
man
or
insect
the
change
of
air
having
made
me
hungry
i
wanted
something
after
supper
being
quite
ready
to
pay
for
it
and
showing
my
purse
as
a
symptom
but
the
face
of
widow
macalister
when
i
proposed
to
have
some
more
food
was
a
thing
to
be
drawn
if
it
could
be
drawn
further
by
our
new
caricaturist
therefore
i
left
her
also
for
liefer
would
i
be
eaten
myself
than
have
nothing
to
eat
and
so
i
came
back
to
my
old
furrier
the
which
was
a
thoroughly
hearty
man
and
welcomed
me
to
my
room
again
with
two
shillings
added
to
the
rent
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
at
seeing
me
being
under
parole
to
master
stickles
i
only
went
out
betwixt
certain
hours
because
i
was
accounted
as
liable
to
be
called
upon
for
what
purpose
i
knew
not
but
hoped
it
might
be
a
good
one
i
felt
it
a
loss
and
a
hindrance
to
me
that
i
was
so
bound
to
remain
at
home
during
the
session
of
the
courts
of
law
for
thereby
the
chance
of
ever
beholding
lorna
was
very
greatly
contracted
if
not
altogether
annihilated
for
these
were
the
very
hours
in
which
the
people
of
fashion
and
the
high
world
were
wont
to
appear
to
the
rest
of
mankind
so
as
to
encourage
them
and
of
course
by
this
time
the
lady
lorna
was
high
among
people
of
fashion
and
was
not
likely
to
be
seen
out
of
fashionable
hours
it
is
true
that
there
were
some
places
of
expensive
entertainment
at
which
the
better
sort
of
mankind
might
be
seen
and
studied
in
their
hours
of
relaxation
by
those
of
the
lower
order
who
could
pay
sufficiently
but
alas
my
money
was
getting
low
and
the
privilege
of
seeing
my
betters
was
more
and
more
denied
to
me
as
my
cash
drew
shorter
for
a
man
must
have
a
good
coat
at
least
and
the
pockets
not
wholly
empty
before
he
can
look
at
those
whom
god
has
created
for
his
ensample
hence
and
from
many
other
causespart
of
which
was
my
own
prideit
happened
that
i
abode
in
london
betwixt
a
month
and
five
weeks
time
ere
ever
i
saw
lorna
it
seemed
unfit
that
i
should
go
and
waylay
her
and
spy
on
her
and
say
or
mean
to
say
lo
here
is
your
poor
faithful
farmer
a
man
who
is
unworthy
of
you
by
means
of
his
common
birth
and
yet
who
dares
to
crawl
across
your
path
that
you
may
pity
him
for
gods
sake
show
a
little
pity
though
you
may
not
feel
it
such
behaviour
might
be
comely
in
a
lovelorn
boy
a
page
to
some
grand
princess
but
i
john
ridd
would
never
stoop
to
the
lowering
of
love
so
nevertheless
i
heard
of
lorna
from
my
worthy
furrier
almost
every
day
and
with
a
fine
exaggeration
this
honest
man
was
one
of
those
who
in
virtue
of
their
trade
and
nicety
of
behaviour
are
admitted
into
noble
life
to
take
measurements
and
show
patterns
and
while
so
doing
they
contrive
to
acquire
what
is
to
the
english
mind
at
once
the
most
important
and
most
interesting
of
all
knowledgethe
science
of
being
able
to
talk
about
the
titled
people
so
my
furrier
whose
name
was
ramsack
having
to
make
robes
for
peers
and
cloaks
for
their
wives
and
otherwise
knew
the
great
folk
sham
or
real
as
well
as
he
knew
a
fox
or
skunk
from
a
wolverine
skin
and
when
with
some
fencing
and
foils
of
inquiry
i
hinted
about
lady
lorna
dugal
the
old
mans
face
became
so
pleasant
that
i
knew
her
birth
must
be
wondrous
high
at
this
my
own
countenance
fell
i
supposefor
the
better
she
was
born
the
harder
she
would
be
to
marryand
mistaking
my
object
he
took
me
up
perhaps
you
think
master
ridd
that
because
her
ladyship
lady
lorna
dugal
is
of
scottish
origin
therefore
her
birth
is
not
as
high
as
of
our
english
nobility
if
you
think
so
you
are
wrong
sir
she
comes
not
of
the
sandy
scotch
race
with
high
cheekbones
and
raw
shoulderblades
who
set
up
pillars
in
their
courtyards
but
she
comes
of
the
very
best
scotch
blood
descended
from
the
norsemen
her
mother
was
of
the
very
noblest
race
the
lords
of
lorne
higher
even
than
the
great
argyle
who
has
lately
made
a
sad
mistake
and
paid
for
it
most
sadly
and
her
father
was
descended
from
the
king
dugal
who
fought
against
alexander
the
great
no
no
master
ridd
none
of
your
promiscuous
blood
such
as
runs
in
the
veins
of
half
our
modern
peerage
why
should
you
trouble
yourself
about
it
master
ramsack
i
replied
let
them
all
go
their
own
ways
and
let
us
all
look
up
to
them
whether
they
come
by
hook
or
crook
not
at
all
not
at
all
my
lad
that
is
not
the
way
to
regard
it
we
look
up
at
the
wellborn
men
and
sideways
at
the
baseborn
then
we
are
all
baseborn
ourselves
i
will
look
up
to
no
man
except
for
what
himself
has
done
come
master
ridd
you
might
be
lashed
from
newgate
to
tyburn
and
back
again
once
a
week
for
a
twelvemonth
if
some
people
heard
you
keep
your
tongue
more
close
young
man
or
here
you
lodge
no
longer
albeit
i
love
your
company
which
smells
to
me
of
the
hayfield
ah
i
have
not
seen
a
hayfield
for
nineandtwenty
years
john
ridd
the
cursed
moths
keep
me
at
home
every
day
of
the
summer
spread
your
furs
on
the
haycocks
i
answered
very
boldly
the
indoor
moth
cannot
abide
the
presence
of
the
outdoor
ones
is
it
so
he
answered
i
never
thought
of
that
before
and
yet
i
have
known
such
strange
things
happen
in
the
way
of
fur
that
i
can
well
believe
it
if
you
only
knew
john
the
way
in
which
they
lay
their
eggs
and
how
they
work
tailforemost
tell
me
nothing
of
the
kind
i
replied
with
equal
confidence
they
cannot
work
tailforemost
and
they
have
no
tails
to
work
with
for
i
knew
a
little
about
grubs
and
the
ignorance
concerning
them
which
we
have
no
right
to
put
up
with
however
not
to
go
into
that
for
the
argument
lasted
a
fortnight
and
then
was
only
come
so
far
as
to
begin
again
master
ramsack
soon
convinced
me
of
the
things
i
knew
already
the
excellence
of
lornas
birth
as
well
as
her
lofty
place
at
court
and
beauty
and
wealth
and
elegance
but
all
these
only
made
me
sigh
and
wish
that
i
were
born
to
them
from
master
ramsack
i
discovered
that
the
nobleman
to
whose
charge
lady
lorna
had
been
committed
by
the
court
of
chancery
was
earl
brandir
of
lochawe
her
poor
mothers
uncle
for
the
countess
of
dugal
was
daughter
and
only
child
of
the
last
lord
lorne
whose
sister
had
married
sir
ensor
doone
while
he
himself
had
married
the
sister
of
earl
brandir
this
nobleman
had
a
country
house
near
the
village
of
kensington
and
here
his
niece
dwelled
with
him
when
she
was
not
in
attendance
on
her
majesty
the
queen
who
had
taken
a
liking
to
her
now
since
the
king
had
begun
to
attend
the
celebration
of
mass
in
the
chapel
at
whitehalland
not
at
westminster
abbey
as
our
gossips
had
averredhe
had
given
order
that
the
doors
should
be
thrown
open
so
that
all
who
could
make
interest
to
get
into
the
antechamber
might
see
this
form
of
worship
master
ramsack
told
me
that
lorna
was
there
almost
every
sunday
their
majesties
being
most
anxious
to
have
the
presence
of
all
the
nobility
of
the
catholic
persuasion
so
as
to
make
a
goodly
show
and
the
worthy
furrier
having
influence
with
the
doorkeepers
kindly
obtained
admittance
for
me
one
sunday
into
the
antechamber
here
i
took
care
to
be
in
waiting
before
the
royal
procession
entered
but
being
unknown
and
of
no
high
rank
i
was
not
allowed
to
stand
forward
among
the
better
people
but
ordered
back
into
a
corner
very
dark
and
dismal
the
verger
remarking
with
a
grin
that
i
could
see
over
all
other
heads
and
must
not
set
my
own
so
high
being
frightened
to
find
myself
among
so
many
people
of
great
rank
and
gorgeous
apparel
i
blushed
at
the
notice
drawn
upon
me
by
this
uncourteous
fellow
and
silently
fell
back
into
the
corner
by
the
hangings
you
may
suppose
that
my
heart
beat
high
when
the
king
and
queen
appeared
and
entered
followed
by
the
duke
of
norfolk
bearing
the
sword
of
state
and
by
several
other
noblemen
and
people
of
repute
then
the
doors
of
the
chapel
were
thrown
wide
open
and
though
i
could
only
see
a
little
being
in
the
corner
so
i
thought
that
it
was
beautiful
bowers
of
rich
silk
were
there
and
plenty
of
metal
shining
and
polished
wood
with
lovely
carving
flowers
too
of
the
noblest
kind
and
candles
made
by
somebody
who
had
learned
how
to
clarify
tallow
this
last
thing
amazed
me
more
than
all
for
our
dips
never
will
come
clear
melt
the
muttonfat
how
you
will
and
methought
that
this
hanging
of
flowers
about
was
a
pretty
thing
for
if
a
man
can
worship
god
best
of
all
beneath
a
tree
as
the
natural
instinct
is
surely
when
by
fault
of
climate
the
tree
would
be
too
apt
to
drip
the
very
best
makebelieve
is
to
have
enough
and
to
spare
of
flowers
which
to
the
dwellers
in
london
seem
to
have
grown
on
the
tree
denied
them
be
that
as
it
may
when
the
king
and
queen
crossed
the
threshold
a
mighty
flourish
of
trumpets
arose
and
a
waving
of
banners
the
knights
of
the
garter
whoever
they
be
were
to
attend
that
day
in
state
and
some
went
in
and
some
stayed
out
and
it
made
me
think
of
the
difference
betwixt
the
ewes
and
the
wethers
for
the
ewes
will
go
wherever
you
lead
them
but
the
wethers
will
not
having
strong
opinions
and
meaning
to
abide
by
them
and
one
man
i
noticed
was
of
the
wethers
to
wit
the
duke
of
norfolk
who
stopped
outside
with
the
sword
of
state
like
a
beadle
with
a
rappingrod
this
has
taken
more
to
tell
than
the
time
it
happened
in
for
after
all
the
men
were
gone
some
to
this
side
some
to
that
according
to
their
feelings
a
number
of
ladies
beautifully
dressed
being
of
the
queens
retinue
began
to
enter
and
were
stared
at
three
times
as
much
as
the
men
had
been
and
indeed
they
were
worth
looking
at
which
men
never
are
to
my
ideas
when
they
trick
themselves
with
gewgaws
but
none
was
so
well
worth
eyeservice
as
my
own
beloved
lorna
she
entered
modestly
and
shyly
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
knowing
the
rudeness
of
the
gallants
and
the
large
sum
she
was
priced
at
her
dress
was
of
the
purest
white
very
sweet
and
simple
without
a
line
of
ornament
for
she
herself
adorned
it
the
way
she
walked
and
touched
her
skirt
rather
than
seemed
to
hold
it
up
with
a
white
hand
beaming
one
red
rose
this
and
her
stately
supple
neck
and
the
flowing
of
her
hair
would
show
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
that
she
could
be
none
but
lorna
doone
lorna
doone
of
my
early
love
in
the
days
when
she
blushed
for
her
name
before
me
by
reason
of
dishonesty
but
now
the
lady
lorna
dugal
as
far
beyond
reproach
as
above
my
poor
affection
all
my
heart
and
all
my
mind
gathered
themselves
upon
her
would
she
see
me
or
would
she
pass
was
there
instinct
in
our
love
by
some
strange
chance
she
saw
me
or
was
it
through
our
destiny
while
with
eyes
kept
sedulously
on
the
marble
floor
to
shun
the
weight
of
admiration
thrust
too
boldly
on
them
while
with
shy
quick
steps
she
passed
some
one
perhaps
with
purpose
trod
on
the
skirt
of
her
clear
white
dresswith
the
quickness
taught
her
by
many
a
scene
of
danger
she
looked
up
and
her
eyes
met
mine
as
i
gazed
upon
her
steadfastly
yearningly
yet
with
some
reproach
and
more
of
pride
than
humility
she
made
me
one
of
the
courtly
bows
which
i
do
so
much
detest
yet
even
that
was
sweet
and
graceful
when
my
lorna
did
it
but
the
colour
of
her
pure
clear
cheeks
was
nearly
as
deep
as
that
of
my
own
when
she
went
on
for
the
religious
work
and
the
shining
of
her
eyes
was
owing
to
an
unpaid
debt
of
tears
upon
the
whole
i
was
satisfied
lorna
had
seen
me
and
had
not
according
to
the
phrase
of
the
high
world
then
even
tried
to
cut
me
whether
this
low
phrase
is
born
of
their
own
stupid
meanness
or
whether
it
comes
of
necessity
exercised
on
a
man
without
money
i
know
not
and
i
care
not
but
one
thing
i
know
right
well
any
man
who
cuts
a
man
except
for
vice
or
meanness
should
be
quartered
without
quarter
all
these
proud
thoughts
rose
within
me
as
the
lovely
form
of
lorna
went
inside
and
was
no
more
seen
and
then
i
felt
how
coarse
i
was
how
apt
to
think
strong
thoughts
and
so
on
without
brains
to
bear
me
out
even
as
a
hens
egg
laid
without
enough
of
lime
and
looking
only
a
poor
jelly
nevertheless
i
waited
on
as
my
usual
manner
is
for
to
be
beaten
while
running
away
is
ten
times
worse
than
to
face
it
out
and
take
it
and
have
done
with
it
so
at
least
i
have
always
found
because
of
reproach
of
conscience
and
all
the
things
those
clever
people
carried
on
inside
at
large
made
me
long
for
our
parson
bowden
that
he
might
know
how
to
act
while
i
stored
up
in
my
memory
enough
to
keep
our
parson
going
through
six
pipes
on
a
saturday
nightto
have
it
as
right
as
could
be
next
daya
lean
man
with
a
yellow
beard
too
thin
for
a
good
catholic
which
religion
always
fattens
came
up
to
me
working
sideways
in
the
manner
of
a
female
crab
this
is
not
to
my
liking
i
said
if
aught
thou
hast
speak
plainly
while
they
make
that
horrible
noise
inside
nothing
had
this
man
to
say
but
with
many
sighs
because
i
was
not
of
the
proper
faith
he
took
my
reprobate
hand
to
save
me
and
with
several
religious
tears
looked
up
at
me
and
winked
with
one
eye
although
the
skin
of
my
palms
was
thick
i
felt
a
little
suggestion
there
as
of
a
gentle
leaf
in
spring
fearing
to
seem
too
forward
i
paid
the
man
and
he
went
happy
for
the
standard
of
heretical
silver
is
purer
than
that
of
the
catholics
then
i
lifted
up
my
little
billet
and
in
that
dark
corner
read
it
with
a
strong
rainbow
of
colours
coming
from
the
angled
light
and
in
mine
eyes
there
was
enough
to
make
rainbow
of
strongest
sun
as
my
anger
clouded
off
not
that
it
began
so
well
but
that
in
my
heart
i
knew
ere
three
lines
were
through
me
that
i
was
with
all
heart
lovedand
beyond
that
who
may
need
the
darling
of
my
life
went
on
as
if
i
were
of
her
own
rank
or
even
better
than
she
was
and
she
dotted
her
is
and
crossed
her
ts
as
if
i
were
at
least
a
schoolmaster
all
of
it
was
done
in
pencil
but
as
plain
as
plain
could
be
in
my
coffin
it
shall
lie
with
my
ring
and
something
else
therefore
will
i
not
expose
it
to
every
man
who
buys
this
book
and
haply
thinks
that
he
has
bought
me
to
the
bottom
of
my
heart
enough
for
men
of
gentle
birth
who
never
are
inquisitive
that
my
love
told
me
in
her
letter
just
to
come
and
see
her
i
ran
away
and
could
not
stop
to
behold
even
her
at
the
moment
would
have
dashed
my
fancys
joy
yet
my
brain
was
so
amiss
that
i
must
do
something
therefore
to
the
river
thames
with
all
speed
i
hurried
and
keeping
all
my
best
clothes
on
indued
for
sake
of
lorna
into
the
quiet
stream
i
leaped
and
swam
as
far
as
london
bridge
and
ate
nobler
dinner
afterwards

lorna
still
is
lorna
although
a
man
may
be
as
simple
as
the
flowers
of
the
field
knowing
when
but
scarcely
why
he
closes
to
the
bitter
wind
and
feeling
why
but
scarcely
when
he
opens
to
the
genial
sun
yet
without
his
questing
much
into
the
capsule
of
himselfto
do
which
is
a
miseryhe
may
have
a
general
notion
how
he
happens
to
be
getting
on
i
felt
myself
to
be
getting
on
better
than
at
any
time
since
the
last
wheatharvest
as
i
took
the
lane
to
kensington
upon
the
monday
evening
for
although
no
time
was
given
in
my
lornas
letter
i
was
not
inclined
to
wait
more
than
decency
required
and
though
i
went
and
watched
the
house
decency
would
not
allow
me
to
knock
on
the
sunday
evening
especially
when
i
found
at
the
corner
that
his
lordship
was
at
home
the
lanes
and
fields
between
charing
cross
and
the
village
of
kensington
are
or
were
at
that
time
more
than
reasonably
infested
with
footpads
and
with
highwaymen
however
my
stature
and
holly
club
kept
these
fellows
from
doing
more
than
casting
sheeps
eyes
at
me
for
it
was
still
broad
daylight
and
the
view
of
the
distant
villages
chelsea
battersea
tyburn
and
others
as
well
as
a
few
large
houses
among
the
hams
and
towards
the
river
made
it
seem
less
lonely
therefore
i
sang
a
song
in
the
broadest
exmoor
dialect
which
caused
no
little
amazement
in
the
minds
of
all
who
met
me
when
i
came
to
earl
brandirs
house
my
natural
modesty
forbade
me
to
appear
at
the
door
for
guests
therefore
i
went
to
the
entrance
for
servants
and
retainers
here
to
my
great
surprise
who
should
come
and
let
me
in
but
little
gwenny
carfax
whose
very
existence
had
almost
escaped
my
recollection
her
mistress
no
doubt
had
seen
me
coming
and
sent
her
to
save
trouble
but
when
i
offered
to
kiss
gwenny
in
my
joy
and
comfort
to
see
a
farmhouse
face
again
she
looked
ashamed
and
turned
away
and
would
hardly
speak
to
me
i
followed
her
to
a
little
room
furnished
very
daintily
and
there
she
ordered
me
to
wait
in
a
most
ungracious
manner
well
thought
i
if
the
mistress
and
the
maid
are
alike
in
temper
better
it
had
been
for
me
to
abide
at
master
ramsacks
but
almost
ere
my
thought
was
done
i
heard
the
light
quick
step
which
i
knew
as
well
as
watch
my
dog
knew
mine
and
my
breast
began
to
tremble
like
the
trembling
of
an
arch
ere
the
keystone
is
put
in
almost
ere
i
hopedfor
fear
and
hope
were
so
entangled
that
they
hindered
one
anotherthe
velvet
hangings
of
the
doorway
parted
with
a
little
doubt
and
then
a
good
face
put
on
it
lorna
in
her
perfect
beauty
stood
before
the
crimson
folds
and
her
dress
was
all
pure
white
and
her
cheeks
were
rosy
pink
and
her
lips
were
scarlet
like
a
maiden
with
skill
and
sense
checking
violent
impulse
she
stayed
there
for
one
moment
only
just
to
be
admired
and
then
like
a
woman
she
came
to
me
seeing
how
alarmed
i
was
the
hand
she
offered
me
i
took
and
raised
it
to
my
lips
with
fear
as
a
thing
too
good
for
me
is
that
all
she
whispered
and
then
her
eyes
gleamed
up
at
me
and
in
another
instant
she
was
weeping
on
my
breast
darling
lorna
lady
lorna
i
cried
in
astonishment
yet
unable
but
to
keep
her
closer
to
me
and
closer
surely
though
i
love
you
so
this
is
not
as
it
should
be
yes
it
is
john
yes
it
is
nothing
else
should
ever
be
oh
why
have
you
behaved
so
i
am
behaving
i
replied
to
the
very
best
of
my
ability
there
is
no
other
man
in
the
world
could
hold
you
so
without
kissing
you
then
why
dont
you
do
it
john
asked
lorna
looking
up
at
me
with
a
flash
of
her
old
fun
now
this
matter
proverbially
is
not
for
discussion
and
repetition
enough
that
we
said
nothing
more
than
oh
john
how
glad
i
am
and
lorna
lorna
lorna
for
about
five
minutes
then
my
darling
drew
back
proudly
with
blushing
cheeks
and
tearbright
eyes
she
began
to
crossexamine
me
master
john
ridd
you
shall
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
i
have
been
in
chancery
sir
and
can
detect
a
story
now
why
have
you
never
for
more
than
a
twelvemonth
taken
the
smallest
notice
of
your
old
friend
mistress
lorna
doone
although
she
spoke
in
this
lightsome
manner
as
if
it
made
no
difference
i
saw
that
her
quick
heart
was
moving
and
the
flash
of
her
eyes
controlled
simply
for
this
cause
i
answered
that
my
old
friend
and
true
love
took
not
the
smallest
heed
of
me
nor
knew
i
where
to
find
her
what
cried
lorna
and
nothing
more
being
overcome
with
wondering
and
much
inclined
to
fall
away
but
for
my
assistance
i
told
her
over
and
over
again
that
not
a
single
syllable
of
any
message
from
her
or
tidings
of
her
welfare
had
reached
me
or
any
one
of
us
since
the
letter
she
left
behind
except
by
soldiers
gossip
oh
you
poor
dear
john
said
lorna
sighing
at
thought
of
my
misery
how
wonderfully
good
of
you
thinking
of
me
as
you
must
have
done
not
to
marry
that
little
plain
thing
or
perhaps
i
should
say
that
lovely
creature
for
i
have
never
seen
her
mistress
ruthi
forget
her
name
but
something
like
a
towel
ruth
huckaback
is
a
worthy
maid
i
answered
with
some
dignity
and
she
alone
of
all
our
world
except
indeed
poor
annie
has
kept
her
confidence
in
you
and
told
me
not
to
dread
your
rank
but
trust
your
heart
lady
lorna
then
ruth
is
my
best
friend
she
answered
and
is
worthy
of
you
dear
john
and
now
remember
one
thing
dear
if
god
should
part
us
as
may
be
by
nothing
short
of
death
try
to
marry
that
little
ruth
when
you
cease
to
remember
me
and
now
for
the
headtraitor
i
have
often
suspected
it
but
she
looks
me
in
the
face
and
wishesfearful
things
which
i
cannot
repeat
with
these
words
she
moved
an
implement
such
as
i
had
not
seen
before
and
which
made
a
ringing
noise
at
a
serious
distance
and
before
i
had
ceased
wonderingfor
if
such
things
go
on
we
might
ring
the
church
bells
while
sitting
in
our
backkitchenlittle
gwenny
carfax
came
with
a
grave
and
sullen
face
gwenny
began
my
lorna
in
a
tone
of
high
rank
and
dignity
go
and
fetch
the
letters
which
i
gave
you
at
various
times
for
despatch
to
mistress
ridd
how
can
i
fetch
them
when
they
are
gone
it
be
no
use
for
him
to
tell
no
lies
now
gwenny
can
you
look
at
me
i
asked
very
sternly
for
the
matter
was
no
joke
to
me
after
a
years
unhappiness
i
dont
want
to
look
at
ee
what
should
i
look
at
a
young
man
for
although
he
did
offer
to
kiss
me
i
saw
the
spite
and
impudence
of
this
last
remark
and
so
did
lorna
although
she
could
not
quite
refrain
from
smiling
now
gwenny
not
to
speak
of
that
said
lorna
very
demurely
if
you
thought
it
honest
to
keep
the
letters
was
it
honest
to
keep
the
money
at
this
the
cornish
maiden
broke
into
a
rage
of
honesty
a
putt
the
money
by
for
ee
ee
shall
have
every
farden
of
it
and
so
she
flung
out
of
the
room
and
gwenny
said
lorna
very
softly
following
under
the
doorhangings
if
it
is
not
honest
to
keep
the
money
it
is
not
honest
to
keep
the
letters
which
would
have
been
worth
more
than
any
gold
to
those
who
were
so
kind
to
you
your
father
shall
know
the
whole
gwenny
unless
you
tell
the
truth
now
a
will
tell
all
the
truth
this
strange
maiden
answered
talking
to
herself
at
least
as
much
as
to
her
mistress
while
she
went
out
of
sight
and
hearing
and
then
i
was
so
glad
at
having
my
own
lorna
once
again
cleared
of
all
contempt
for
us
and
true
to
me
through
all
of
it
that
i
would
have
forgiven
gwenny
for
treason
or
even
forgery
i
trusted
her
so
much
said
lorna
in
her
old
illfortuned
way
and
look
how
she
has
deceived
me
that
is
why
i
love
you
john
setting
other
things
aside
because
you
never
told
me
falsehood
and
you
never
could
you
know
well
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
i
think
i
could
tell
any
lie
to
have
you
darling
all
my
own
yes
and
perhaps
it
might
be
right
to
other
people
besides
us
two
but
you
could
not
do
it
to
me
john
you
never
could
do
it
to
me
you
know
before
i
quite
perceived
my
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
distinctionalthough
beyond
doubt
a
valid
onegwenny
came
back
with
a
leathern
bag
and
tossed
it
upon
the
table
not
a
word
did
she
vouchsafe
to
us
but
stood
there
looking
injured
go
and
get
your
letters
john
said
lorna
very
gravely
or
at
least
your
mothers
letters
made
of
messages
to
you
as
for
gwenny
she
shall
go
before
lord
justice
jeffreys
i
knew
that
lorna
meant
it
not
but
thought
that
the
girl
deserved
a
frightening
as
indeed
she
did
but
we
both
mistook
the
courage
of
this
child
of
cornwall
she
stepped
upon
a
little
round
thing
in
the
nature
of
a
stool
such
as
i
never
had
seen
before
and
thus
delivered
her
sentiments
and
you
may
take
me
if
you
please
before
the
great
lord
jeffreys
i
have
done
no
more
than
duty
though
i
did
it
crookedly
and
told
a
heap
of
lies
for
your
sake
and
pretty
gratitude
i
gets
much
gratitude
you
have
shown
replied
lorna
to
master
ridd
for
all
his
kindness
and
his
goodness
to
you
who
was
it
that
went
down
at
the
peril
of
his
life
and
brought
your
father
to
you
when
you
had
lost
him
for
months
and
months
who
was
it
answer
me
gwenny
girt
jan
ridd
said
the
handmaid
very
sulkily
what
made
you
treat
me
so
little
gwenny
i
asked
for
lorna
would
not
ask
lest
the
reply
should
vex
me
because
ee
beest
below
her
so
her
shanna
have
a
poor
farmering
chap
not
even
if
her
were
a
carnishman
all
her
land
and
all
her
birthand
who
be
you
id
like
to
know
gwenny
you
may
go
said
lorna
reddening
with
quiet
anger
and
remember
that
you
come
not
near
me
for
the
next
three
days
it
is
the
only
way
to
punish
her
she
continued
to
me
when
the
maid
was
gone
in
a
storm
of
sobbing
and
weeping
now
for
the
next
three
days
she
will
scarcely
touch
a
morsel
of
food
and
scarcely
do
a
thing
but
cry
make
up
your
mind
to
one
thing
john
if
you
mean
to
take
me
for
better
for
worse
you
will
have
to
take
gwenny
with
me
i
would
take
you
with
fifty
gwennies
said
i
although
every
one
of
them
hated
me
which
i
do
not
believe
this
little
maid
does
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
no
one
can
possibly
hate
you
john
she
answered
very
softly
and
i
was
better
pleased
with
this
than
if
she
had
called
me
the
most
noble
and
glorious
man
in
the
kingdom
after
this
we
spoke
of
ourselves
and
the
way
people
would
regard
us
supposing
that
when
lorna
came
to
be
her
own
free
mistress
as
she
must
do
in
the
course
of
time
she
were
to
throw
her
rank
aside
and
refuse
her
title
and
caring
not
a
fig
for
folk
who
cared
less
than
a
figstalk
for
her
should
shape
her
mind
to
its
native
bent
and
to
my
perfect
happiness
it
was
not
my
place
to
say
much
lest
i
should
appear
to
use
an
improper
and
selfish
influence
and
of
course
to
all
men
of
common
sense
and
to
everybody
of
middle
age
who
must
know
best
what
is
good
for
youth
the
thoughts
which
my
lorna
entertained
would
be
enough
to
prove
her
madness
not
that
we
could
not
keep
her
well
comfortably
and
with
nice
clothes
and
plenty
of
flowers
and
fruit
and
landscape
and
the
knowledge
of
our
neighbours
affairs
and
their
kind
interest
in
our
own
still
this
would
not
be
as
if
she
were
the
owner
of
a
county
and
a
haughty
title
and
able
to
lead
the
first
men
of
the
age
by
her
mind
and
face
and
money
therefore
was
i
quite
resolved
not
to
have
a
word
to
say
while
this
young
queen
of
wealth
and
beauty
and
of
noblemens
desire
made
her
mind
up
how
to
act
for
her
purest
happiness
but
to
do
her
justice
this
was
not
the
first
thing
she
was
thinking
of
the
test
of
her
judgment
was
only
this
how
will
my
love
be
happiest
now
john
she
cried
for
she
was
so
quick
that
she
always
had
my
thoughts
beforehand
why
will
you
be
backward
as
if
you
cared
not
for
me
do
you
dream
that
i
am
doubting
my
mind
has
been
made
up
good
john
that
you
must
be
my
husband
forwell
i
will
not
say
how
long
lest
you
should
laugh
at
my
folly
but
i
believe
it
was
ever
since
you
came
with
your
stockings
off
and
the
loaches
right
early
for
me
to
make
up
my
mind
but
you
know
that
you
made
up
yours
john
and
of
course
i
knew
it
and
that
had
a
great
effect
on
me
now
after
all
this
age
of
loving
shall
a
trifle
sever
us
i
told
her
that
it
was
no
trifle
but
a
most
important
thing
to
abandon
wealth
and
honour
and
the
brilliance
of
high
life
and
be
despised
by
every
one
for
such
abundant
folly
moreover
that
i
should
appear
a
knave
for
taking
advantage
of
her
youth
and
boundless
generosity
and
ruining
as
men
would
say
a
noble
maid
by
my
selfishness
and
i
told
her
outright
having
worked
myself
up
by
my
own
conversation
that
she
was
bound
to
consult
her
guardian
and
that
without
his
knowledge
i
would
come
no
more
to
see
her
her
flash
of
pride
at
these
last
words
made
her
look
like
an
empress
and
i
was
about
to
explain
myself
better
but
she
put
forth
her
hand
and
stopped
me
i
think
that
condition
should
rather
have
proceeded
from
me
you
are
mistaken
master
ridd
in
supposing
that
i
would
think
of
receiving
you
in
secret
it
was
a
different
thing
in
glen
doone
where
all
except
yourself
were
thieves
and
when
i
was
but
a
simple
child
and
oppressed
with
constant
fear
you
are
quite
right
in
threatening
to
visit
me
thus
no
more
but
i
think
you
might
have
waited
for
an
invitation
sir
and
you
are
quite
right
lady
lorna
in
pointing
out
my
presumption
it
is
a
fault
that
must
ever
be
found
in
any
speech
of
mine
to
you
this
i
said
so
humbly
and
not
with
any
bitternessfor
i
knew
that
i
had
gone
too
farand
made
her
so
polite
a
bow
that
she
forgave
me
in
a
moment
and
we
begged
each
others
pardon
now
will
you
allow
me
just
to
explain
my
own
view
of
this
matter
john
said
she
once
more
my
darling
it
may
be
a
very
foolish
view
but
i
shall
never
change
it
please
not
to
interrupt
me
dear
until
you
have
heard
me
to
the
end
in
the
first
place
it
is
quite
certain
that
neither
you
nor
i
can
be
happy
without
the
other
then
what
stands
between
us
worldly
position
and
nothing
else
i
have
no
more
education
than
you
have
john
ridd
nay
and
not
so
much
my
birth
and
ancestry
are
not
one
whit
more
pure
than
yours
although
they
may
be
better
known
your
descent
from
ancient
freeholders
for
fiveandtwenty
generations
of
good
honest
men
although
you
bear
no
coat
of
arms
is
better
than
the
lineage
of
nine
proud
english
noblemen
out
of
every
ten
i
meet
with
in
manners
though
your
mighty
strength
and
hatred
of
any
meanness
sometimes
break
out
in
violenceof
which
i
must
try
to
cure
you
dearin
manners
if
kindness
and
gentleness
and
modesty
are
the
true
things
wanted
you
are
immeasurably
above
any
of
our
courtgallants
who
indeed
have
very
little
as
for
difference
of
religion
we
allow
for
one
another
neither
having
been
brought
up
in
a
bitterly
pious
manner
here
though
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
at
the
loving
things
love
said
of
me
i
could
not
help
a
little
laugh
at
the
notion
of
any
bitter
piety
being
found
among
the
doones
or
even
in
mother
for
that
matter
lorna
smiled
in
her
slyest
manner
and
went
on
again
now
you
see
i
have
proved
my
point
there
is
nothing
between
us
but
worldly
positionif
you
can
defend
me
against
the
doones
for
which
i
trow
i
may
trust
you
and
worldly
position
means
wealth
and
title
and
the
right
to
be
in
great
houses
and
the
pleasure
of
being
envied
i
have
not
been
here
for
a
year
john
without
learning
something
oh
i
hate
it
how
i
hate
it
of
all
the
people
i
know
there
are
but
two
besides
my
uncle
who
do
not
either
covet
or
detest
me
and
who
are
those
two
think
you
gwenny
for
one
i
answered
yes
gwenny
for
one
and
the
queen
for
the
other
the
one
is
too
far
below
me
i
mean
in
her
own
opinion
and
the
other
too
high
above
as
for
the
women
who
dislike
me
without
having
even
heard
my
voice
i
simply
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
as
for
the
men
who
covet
me
for
my
land
and
money
i
merely
compare
them
with
you
john
ridd
and
all
thought
of
them
is
over
oh
john
you
must
never
forsake
me
however
cross
i
am
to
you
i
thought
you
would
have
gone
just
now
and
though
i
would
not
move
to
stop
you
my
heart
would
have
broken
you
dont
catch
me
go
in
a
hurry
i
answered
very
sensibly
when
the
loveliest
maiden
in
all
the
world
and
the
best
and
the
dearest
loves
me
all
my
fear
of
you
is
gone
darling
lorna
all
my
fear
is
it
possible
you
could
fear
me
john
after
all
we
have
been
through
together
now
you
promised
not
to
interrupt
me
is
this
fair
behaviour
well
let
me
see
where
i
left
offoh
that
my
heart
would
have
broken
upon
that
point
i
will
say
no
more
lest
you
should
grow
conceited
john
if
anything
could
make
you
so
but
i
do
assure
you
that
half
londonhowever
upon
that
point
also
i
will
check
my
power
of
speech
lest
you
think
me
conceited
and
now
to
put
aside
all
nonsense
though
i
have
talked
none
for
a
year
john
having
been
so
unhappy
and
now
it
is
such
a
relief
to
me
then
talk
it
for
an
hour
said
i
and
let
me
sit
and
watch
you
to
me
it
is
the
very
sweetest
of
all
sweetest
wisdom
nay
there
is
no
time
she
answered
glancing
at
a
jewelled
timepiece
scarcely
larger
than
an
oyster
which
she
drew
from
her
waistband
and
then
she
pushed
it
away
in
confusion
lest
its
wealth
should
startle
me
my
uncle
will
come
home
in
less
than
half
an
hour
dear
and
you
are
not
the
one
to
take
a
sidepassage
and
avoid
him
i
shall
tell
him
that
you
have
been
here
and
that
i
mean
you
to
come
again
as
lorna
said
this
with
a
manner
as
confident
as
need
be
i
saw
that
she
had
learned
in
town
the
power
of
her
beauty
and
knew
that
she
could
do
with
most
men
aught
she
set
her
mind
upon
and
as
she
stood
there
flushed
with
pride
and
faith
in
her
own
loveliness
and
radiant
with
the
love
itself
i
felt
that
she
must
do
exactly
as
she
pleased
with
every
one
for
now
in
turn
and
elegance
and
richness
and
variety
there
was
nothing
to
compare
with
her
face
unless
it
were
her
figure
therefore
i
gave
in
and
said
darling
do
just
what
you
please
only
make
no
rogue
of
me
for
that
she
gave
me
the
simplest
kindest
and
sweetest
of
all
kisses
and
i
went
down
the
great
stairs
grandly
thinking
of
nothing
else
but
that
chapter
lxviii
john
is
john
no
longer
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
tell
the
state
of
mind
in
which
i
lived
for
a
long
time
after
this
i
put
away
from
me
all
torment
and
the
thought
of
future
cares
and
the
sight
of
difficulty
and
to
myself
appeared
which
means
that
i
became
the
luckiest
of
lucky
fellows
since
the
world
itself
began
i
thought
not
of
the
harvest
even
nor
of
the
men
who
would
get
their
wages
without
having
earned
them
nor
of
my
mothers
anxiety
and
worry
about
john
frys
great
fatness
which
was
growing
upon
him
and
how
she
would
cry
fifty
times
in
a
day
ah
if
our
john
would
only
come
home
how
different
everything
would
look
although
there
were
no
soldiers
now
quartered
at
plovers
barrows
all
being
busied
in
harassing
the
country
and
hanging
the
people
where
the
rebellion
had
thriven
most
my
mother
having
received
from
me
a
message
containing
my
place
of
abode
contrived
to
send
me
by
the
packhorses
as
fine
a
maund
as
need
be
of
provisions
and
money
and
other
comforts
therein
i
found
addressed
to
colonel
jeremiah
stickles
in
lizzies
best
handwriting
half
a
side
of
the
dried
deers
flesh
in
which
he
rejoiced
so
greatly
also
for
lorna
a
fine
green
goose
with
a
little
salt
towards
the
tail
and
newlaid
eggs
inside
it
as
well
as
a
bottle
of
brandied
cherries
and
seven
or
it
may
have
been
eight
pounds
of
fresh
homemade
butter
moreover
to
myself
there
was
a
letter
full
of
good
advice
excellently
well
expressed
and
would
have
been
of
the
greatest
value
if
i
had
cared
to
read
it
but
i
read
all
about
the
farm
affairs
and
the
man
who
had
offered
himself
to
our
betty
for
the
five
pounds
in
her
stocking
as
well
as
the
antics
of
sally
snowe
and
how
she
had
almost
thrown
herself
at
parson
bowdens
head
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
because
on
the
sunday
after
the
hanging
of
a
countisbury
man
he
had
preached
a
beautiful
sermon
about
christian
love
which
lizzie
with
her
sharp
eyes
found
to
be
the
work
of
good
bishop
ken
also
i
read
that
the
doones
were
quiet
the
parishes
round
about
having
united
to
feed
them
well
through
the
harvest
time
so
that
after
the
days
hard
work
the
farmers
might
go
to
bed
at
night
and
this
plan
had
been
found
to
answer
well
and
to
save
much
trouble
on
both
sides
so
that
everybody
wondered
it
had
not
been
done
before
but
lizzie
thought
that
the
doones
could
hardly
be
expected
much
longer
to
put
up
with
it
and
probably
would
not
have
done
so
now
but
for
a
little
adversity
to
wit
that
the
famous
colonel
kirke
had
in
the
most
outrageous
manner
hanged
no
less
than
six
of
them
who
were
captured
among
the
rebels
for
he
said
that
men
of
their
rank
and
breeding
and
above
all
of
their
religion
should
have
known
better
than
to
join
ploughboys
and
carters
and
pickaxemen
against
our
lord
the
king
and
his
holiness
the
pope
this
hanging
of
so
many
doones
caused
some
indignation
among
people
who
were
used
to
them
and
it
seemed
for
a
while
to
check
the
rest
from
any
spirit
of
enterprise
moreover
i
found
from
this
same
letter
which
was
pinned
upon
the
knuckle
of
a
leg
of
mutton
for
fear
of
being
lost
in
straw
that
good
tom
faggus
was
at
home
again
and
nearly
cured
of
his
dreadful
wound
but
intended
to
go
to
war
no
more
only
to
mind
his
family
and
it
grieved
him
more
than
anything
he
ever
could
have
imagined
that
his
duty
to
his
family
and
the
strong
power
of
his
conscience
so
totally
forbade
him
to
come
up
and
see
after
me
for
now
his
design
was
to
lead
a
new
life
and
be
in
charity
with
all
men
many
better
men
than
he
had
been
hanged
he
saw
no
cause
to
doubt
but
by
the
grace
of
god
he
hoped
himself
to
cheat
the
gallows
there
was
no
further
news
of
moment
in
this
very
clever
letter
except
that
the
price
of
horses
shoes
was
gone
up
again
though
already
twopencefarthing
each
and
that
betty
had
broken
her
lovers
head
with
the
stocking
full
of
money
and
then
in
the
corner
it
was
written
that
the
distinguished
man
of
war
and
worshipful
scholar
master
bloxham
was
now
promoted
to
take
the
tolls
and
catch
all
the
rebels
around
our
part
lorna
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
goose
and
the
butter
and
the
brandied
cherries
and
the
earl
brandir
himself
declared
that
he
never
tasted
better
than
those
last
and
would
beg
the
young
man
from
the
country
to
procure
him
instructions
for
making
them
this
nobleman
being
as
deaf
as
a
post
and
of
a
very
solid
mind
could
never
be
brought
to
understand
the
nature
of
my
thoughts
towards
lorna
he
looked
upon
me
as
an
excellent
youth
who
had
rescued
the
maiden
from
the
doones
whom
he
cordially
detested
and
learning
that
i
had
thrown
two
of
them
out
of
window
as
the
story
was
told
him
he
patted
me
on
the
back
and
declared
that
his
doors
would
ever
be
open
to
me
and
that
i
could
not
come
too
often
i
thought
this
very
kind
of
his
lordship
especially
as
it
enabled
me
to
see
my
darling
lorna
not
indeed
as
often
as
i
wished
but
at
any
rate
very
frequently
and
as
many
times
as
modesty
ever
my
leading
principle
would
in
common
conscience
approve
of
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
ever
i
could
help
earl
brandir
it
would
beas
we
say
when
with
brandy
and
waterthe
proudest
moment
of
my
life
when
i
could
fulfil
the
pledge
and
i
soon
was
able
to
help
lord
brandir
as
i
think
in
two
different
ways
first
of
all
as
regarded
his
mind
and
then
as
concerned
his
body
and
the
latter
perhaps
was
the
greatest
service
at
his
time
of
life
but
not
to
be
too
nice
about
that
let
me
tell
how
these
things
were
lorna
said
to
me
one
day
being
in
a
state
of
excitementwhereto
she
was
over
prone
when
reft
of
my
slowness
to
steady
her
i
will
tell
him
john
i
must
tell
him
john
it
is
mean
of
me
to
conceal
it
i
thought
that
she
meant
all
about
our
love
which
we
had
endeavoured
thrice
to
drill
into
his
fine
old
ears
but
could
not
make
him
comprehend
without
risk
of
bringing
the
house
down
and
so
i
said
by
all
means
darling
have
another
try
at
it
lorna
however
looked
at
mefor
her
eyes
told
more
than
tongueas
much
as
to
say
well
you
are
a
stupid
we
agreed
to
let
that
subject
rest
and
then
she
saw
that
i
was
vexed
at
my
own
want
of
quickness
and
so
she
spoke
very
kindly
i
meant
about
his
poor
son
dearest
the
son
of
his
old
age
almost
whose
loss
threw
him
into
that
dreadful
coldfor
he
went
without
hat
to
look
for
himwhich
ended
in
his
losing
the
use
of
his
dear
old
ears
i
believe
if
we
could
only
get
him
to
plovers
barrows
for
a
month
he
would
be
able
to
hear
again
and
look
at
his
age
he
is
not
much
over
seventy
john
you
know
and
i
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
hear
me
long
after
you
are
seventy
john
well
said
i
god
settles
that
or
at
any
rate
he
leaves
us
time
to
think
about
those
questions
when
we
are
over
fifty
now
let
me
know
what
you
want
lorna
the
idea
of
my
being
seventy
but
you
would
still
be
beautiful
to
the
one
who
loves
me
she
answered
trying
to
make
wrinkles
in
her
pure
bright
forehead
but
if
you
will
have
common
sense
as
you
always
will
john
whether
i
wish
it
or
otherwisei
want
to
know
whether
i
am
bound
in
honour
and
in
conscience
to
tell
my
dear
and
good
old
uncle
what
i
know
about
his
son
first
let
me
understand
quite
clearly
said
i
never
being
in
a
hurry
except
when
passion
moves
me
what
his
lordship
thinks
at
present
and
how
far
his
mind
is
urged
with
sorrow
and
anxiety
this
was
not
the
first
time
we
had
spoken
of
the
matter
why
you
know
john
well
enough
she
answered
wondering
at
my
coolness
that
my
poor
uncle
still
believes
that
his
one
beloved
son
will
come
to
light
and
live
again
he
has
made
all
arrangements
accordingly
all
his
property
is
settled
on
that
supposition
he
knows
that
young
alan
always
was
what
he
calls
a
feckless
neerdoweel
but
he
loves
him
all
the
more
for
that
he
cannot
believe
that
he
will
die
without
his
son
coming
back
to
him
and
he
always
has
a
bedroom
ready
and
a
bottle
of
alans
favourite
wine
cool
from
out
the
cellar
he
has
made
me
work
him
a
pair
of
slippers
from
the
size
of
a
mouldy
boot
and
if
he
hears
of
a
new
tobaccomuch
as
he
hates
the
smell
of
ithe
will
go
to
the
other
end
of
london
to
get
some
for
alan
now
you
know
how
deaf
he
is
but
if
any
one
say
alan
even
in
the
place
outside
the
door
he
will
make
his
courteous
bow
to
the
very
highest
visitor
and
be
out
there
in
a
moment
and
search
the
entire
passage
and
yet
let
no
one
know
it
it
is
a
piteous
thing
i
said
for
lornas
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
he
means
me
to
marry
him
it
is
the
pet
scheme
of
his
life
i
am
to
grow
more
beautiful
and
more
highly
taught
and
graceful
until
it
pleases
alan
to
come
back
and
demand
me
can
you
understand
this
matter
john
or
do
you
think
my
uncle
mad
lorna
i
should
be
mad
myself
to
call
any
other
man
mad
for
hoping
then
will
you
tell
me
what
to
do
it
makes
me
very
sorrowful
for
i
know
that
alan
brandir
lies
below
the
sod
in
doonevalley
and
if
you
tell
his
father
i
answered
softly
but
clearly
in
a
few
weeks
he
will
lie
below
the
sod
in
london
at
least
if
there
is
any
perhaps
you
are
right
john
she
replied
to
lose
hope
must
be
a
dreadful
thing
when
one
is
turned
of
seventy
therefore
i
will
never
tell
him
the
other
way
in
which
i
managed
to
help
the
good
earl
brandir
was
of
less
true
moment
to
him
but
as
he
could
not
know
of
the
first
this
was
the
one
which
moved
him
and
it
happened
pretty
much
as
followsthough
i
hardly
like
to
tell
because
it
advanced
me
to
such
a
height
as
i
myself
was
giddy
at
and
which
all
my
friends
resented
greatly
save
those
of
my
own
family
and
even
now
are
sometimes
bitter
in
spite
of
all
my
humility
now
this
is
a
matter
of
history
because
the
king
was
concerned
in
it
and
being
so
strongly
misunderstood
especially
in
my
own
neighbourhood
i
will
overcome
so
far
as
i
can
my
diffidence
in
telling
it
the
good
earl
brandir
was
a
man
of
the
noblest
charity
true
charity
begins
at
home
and
so
did
his
and
was
afraid
of
losing
the
way
if
it
went
abroad
so
this
good
nobleman
kept
his
money
in
a
handsome
pewter
box
with
his
coat
of
arms
upon
it
and
a
double
lid
and
locks
moreover
there
was
a
heavy
chain
fixed
to
a
staple
in
the
wall
so
that
none
might
carry
off
the
pewter
with
the
gold
inside
of
it
lorna
told
me
the
box
was
full
for
she
had
seen
him
go
to
it
and
she
often
thought
that
it
would
be
nice
for
us
to
begin
the
world
with
i
told
her
that
she
must
not
allow
her
mind
to
dwell
upon
things
of
this
sort
being
wholly
against
the
last
commandment
set
up
in
our
church
at
oare
now
one
evening
towards
september
when
the
days
were
drawing
in
looking
back
at
the
house
to
see
whether
lorna
were
looking
after
me
i
espied
by
a
little
glimpse
as
it
were
a
pair
of
villainous
fellows
about
whom
there
could
be
no
mistake
watching
from
the
thicketcorner
some
hundred
yards
or
so
behind
the
good
earls
dwelling
there
is
mischief
afoot
thought
i
to
myself
being
thoroughly
conversant
with
theft
from
my
knowledge
of
the
doones
how
will
be
the
moon
tonight
and
when
may
we
expect
the
watch
i
found
that
neither
moon
nor
watch
could
be
looked
for
until
the
morning
the
moon
of
course
before
the
watch
and
more
likely
to
be
punctual
therefore
i
resolved
to
wait
and
see
what
those
two
villains
did
and
save
if
it
were
possible
the
earl
of
brandirs
pewter
box
but
inasmuch
as
those
bad
men
were
almost
sure
to
have
seen
me
leaving
the
house
and
looking
back
and
striking
out
on
the
london
road
i
marched
along
at
a
merry
pace
until
they
could
not
discern
me
and
then
i
fetched
a
compass
round
and
refreshed
myself
at
a
certain
inn
entitled
the
crossbones
and
buttons
here
i
remained
until
it
was
very
nearly
as
dark
as
pitch
and
the
house
being
full
of
footpads
and
cutthroats
i
thought
it
right
to
leave
them
one
or
two
came
after
me
in
the
hope
of
designing
a
stratagem
but
i
dropped
them
in
the
darkness
and
knowing
all
the
neighbourhood
well
i
took
up
my
position
two
hours
before
midnight
among
the
shrubs
at
the
eastern
end
of
lord
brandirs
mansion
hence
although
i
might
not
see
i
could
scarcely
fail
to
hear
if
any
unlawful
entrance
either
at
back
or
front
were
made
from
my
own
observation
i
thought
it
likely
that
the
attack
would
be
in
the
rear
and
so
indeed
it
came
to
pass
for
when
all
the
lights
were
quenched
and
all
the
house
was
quiet
i
heard
a
low
and
wily
whistle
from
a
clump
of
trees
close
by
and
then
three
figures
passed
between
me
and
a
whitewashed
wall
and
came
to
a
window
which
opened
into
a
part
of
the
servants
basement
this
window
was
carefully
raised
by
some
one
inside
the
house
and
after
a
little
whispering
and
something
which
sounded
like
a
kiss
all
the
three
men
entered
oh
you
villains
i
said
to
myself
this
is
worse
than
any
doone
job
because
there
is
treachery
in
it
but
without
waiting
to
consider
the
subject
from
a
moral
point
of
view
i
crept
along
the
wall
and
entered
very
quietly
after
them
being
rather
uneasy
about
my
life
because
i
bore
no
firearms
and
had
nothing
more
than
my
holly
staff
for
even
a
violent
combat
to
me
this
was
matter
of
deep
regret
as
i
followed
these
vile
men
inward
nevertheless
i
was
resolved
that
my
lorna
should
not
be
robbed
again
through
us
or
at
least
through
our
annie
she
had
lost
that
brilliant
necklace
which
then
was
her
only
birthright
therefore
it
behoved
me
doubly
to
preserve
the
pewter
box
which
must
belong
to
her
in
the
end
unless
the
thieves
got
hold
of
it
i
went
along
very
delicately
as
a
man
who
has
learned
to
wrestle
can
do
although
he
may
weigh
twenty
stone
following
carefully
the
light
brought
by
the
traitorous
maid
and
shaking
in
her
loose
dishonest
hand
i
saw
her
lead
the
men
into
a
little
place
called
a
pantry
and
there
she
gave
them
cordials
and
i
could
hear
them
boasting
not
to
be
too
long
over
itwhich
they
were
much
inclined
to
bei
followed
them
from
this
drinkingbout
by
the
aid
of
the
light
they
bore
as
far
as
earl
brandirs
bedroom
which
i
knew
because
lorna
had
shown
it
to
me
that
i
might
admire
the
tapestry
but
i
had
said
that
no
horse
could
ever
be
shod
as
the
horses
were
shod
therein
unless
he
had
the
foot
of
a
frog
as
well
as
a
frog
to
his
foot
and
lorna
had
been
vexed
at
this
as
taste
and
high
art
always
are
at
any
small
accurate
knowledge
and
so
she
had
brought
me
out
again
before
i
had
time
to
admire
things
now
keeping
well
away
in
the
dark
yet
nearer
than
was
necessary
to
my
own
dear
lornas
room
i
saw
these
fellows
try
the
door
of
the
good
earl
brandir
knowing
from
the
maid
of
course
that
his
lordship
could
hear
nothing
except
the
name
of
alan
they
tried
the
lock
and
pushed
at
it
and
even
set
their
knees
upright
but
a
scottish
nobleman
may
be
trusted
to
secure
his
door
at
night
so
they
were
forced
to
break
it
open
and
at
this
the
guilty
maid
or
woman
ran
away
these
three
roguesfor
rogues
they
were
and
no
charity
may
deny
itburst
into
earl
brandirs
room
with
a
light
and
a
crowbar
and
firearms
i
thought
to
myself
that
this
was
hard
upon
an
honest
nobleman
and
if
further
mischief
could
be
saved
i
would
try
to
save
it
when
i
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
being
myself
in
shadow
i
beheld
two
bad
men
trying
vainly
to
break
open
the
pewter
box
and
the
third
with
a
pistolmuzzle
laid
to
the
nightcap
of
his
lordship
with
foul
face
and
yet
fouler
words
this
man
was
demanding
the
key
of
the
box
which
the
other
men
could
by
no
means
open
neither
drag
it
from
the
chain
i
tell
you
said
this
aged
earl
beginning
to
understand
at
last
what
these
rogues
were
up
for
i
will
give
no
key
to
you
it
all
belongs
to
my
boy
alan
no
one
else
shall
have
a
farthing
then
you
may
count
your
moments
lord
the
key
is
in
your
old
cramped
hand
one
two
and
at
three
i
shoot
you
i
saw
that
the
old
man
was
abroad
not
with
fear
but
with
great
wonder
and
the
regrets
of
deafness
and
i
saw
that
rather
would
he
be
shot
than
let
these
men
go
rob
his
son
buried
now
or
laid
to
bleach
in
the
tangles
of
the
wood
three
or
it
might
be
four
years
agone
but
still
alive
to
his
father
hereupon
my
heart
was
moved
and
i
resolved
to
interfere
the
thief
with
the
pistol
began
to
count
as
i
crossed
the
floor
very
quietly
while
the
old
earl
fearfully
gazed
at
the
muzzle
but
clenched
still
tighter
his
wrinkled
hand
the
villain
with
hair
all
over
his
eyes
and
the
great
horsepistol
levelled
cried
three
and
pulled
the
trigger
but
luckily
at
that
very
moment
i
struck
up
the
barrel
with
my
staff
so
that
the
shot
pierced
the
tester
and
then
with
a
spin
and
a
thwack
i
brought
the
good
holly
down
upon
the
rascals
head
in
a
manner
which
stretched
him
upon
the
floor
meanwhile
the
other
two
robbers
had
taken
the
alarm
and
rushed
at
me
one
with
a
pistol
and
one
with
a
hanger
which
forced
me
to
be
very
lively
fearing
the
pistol
most
i
flung
the
heavy
velvet
curtain
of
the
bed
across
that
he
might
not
see
where
to
aim
at
me
and
then
stooping
very
quickly
i
caught
up
the
senseless
robber
and
set
him
up
for
a
shield
and
target
whereupon
he
was
shot
immediately
without
having
the
pain
of
knowing
it
and
a
happy
thing
it
was
for
him
now
the
other
two
were
at
my
mercy
being
men
below
the
average
strength
and
no
hanger
except
in
most
skilful
hands
as
well
as
firm
and
strong
ones
has
any
chance
to
a
powerful
man
armed
with
a
stout
cudgel
and
thoroughly
practised
in
singlestick
so
i
took
these
two
rogues
and
bound
them
together
and
leaving
them
under
charge
of
the
butler
a
worthy
and
shrewd
scotchman
i
myself
went
in
search
of
the
constables
whom
after
some
few
hours
i
found
neither
were
they
so
drunk
but
what
they
could
take
roped
men
to
prison
in
the
morning
these
two
men
were
brought
before
the
justices
of
the
peace
and
now
my
wonderful
luck
appeared
for
the
merit
of
having
defeated
and
caught
them
would
never
have
raised
me
one
step
in
the
state
or
in
public
consideration
if
they
had
only
been
common
robbers
or
even
notorious
murderers
but
when
these
fellows
were
recognised
by
some
one
in
the
court
as
protestant
witnesses
out
of
employment
companions
and
understrappers
to
oates
and
bedloe
and
carstairs
and
hand
in
glove
with
dangerfield
turberville
and
dugdalein
a
word
the
very
men
against
whom
his
majesty
the
king
bore
the
bitterest
rancour
but
whom
he
had
hitherto
failed
to
catchwhen
this
was
laid
before
the
public
with
emphasis
and
admiration
at
least
a
dozen
men
came
up
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
and
prayed
me
to
accept
their
congratulations
and
to
be
sure
to
remember
them
for
all
were
of
neglected
merit
and
required
no
more
than
a
piece
of
luck
i
answered
them
very
modestly
and
each
according
to
his
worth
as
stated
by
himself
who
of
course
could
judge
the
best
the
magistrate
made
me
many
compliments
ten
times
more
than
i
deserved
and
took
good
care
to
have
them
copied
that
his
majesty
might
see
them
and
ere
the
case
was
thoroughly
heard
and
those
poor
fellows
were
committed
more
than
a
score
of
generous
men
had
offered
to
lend
me
a
hundred
pounds
wherewith
to
buy
a
new
court
suit
when
called
before
his
majesty
now
this
may
seem
very
strange
to
us
who
live
in
a
better
and
purer
ageor
say
at
least
that
we
do
soand
yet
who
are
we
to
condemn
our
fathers
for
teaching
us
better
manners
and
at
their
own
expense
with
these
points
any
virtuous
man
is
bound
to
deal
quite
tenderly
making
allowance
for
corruption
and
not
being
too
sure
of
himself
and
to
tell
the
truth
although
i
had
seen
so
little
of
the
world
as
yet
that
which
astonished
me
in
the
matter
was
not
so
much
that
they
paid
me
court
as
that
they
found
out
so
soon
the
expediency
of
doing
it
in
the
course
of
that
same
afternoon
i
was
sent
for
by
his
majesty
he
had
summoned
first
the
good
earl
brandir
and
received
the
tale
from
him
not
without
exaggeration
although
my
lord
was
a
scotchman
but
the
chief
thing
his
majesty
cared
to
know
was
that
beyond
all
possible
doubt
these
were
the
very
precious
fellows
from
perjury
turned
to
robbery
being
fully
assured
at
last
of
this
his
majesty
had
rubbed
his
hands
and
ordered
the
boots
of
a
stricter
pattern
which
he
himself
had
invented
to
be
brought
at
once
that
he
might
have
them
in
the
best
possible
order
and
he
oiled
them
himself
and
expressed
his
fear
that
there
was
no
man
in
london
quite
competent
to
work
them
nevertheless
he
would
try
one
or
two
rather
than
wait
for
his
pleasure
till
the
torturer
came
from
edinburgh
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
send
for
me
and
in
great
alarm
and
flurry
i
put
on
my
best
clothes
and
hired
a
fashionable
hairdresser
and
drank
half
a
gallon
of
ale
because
both
my
hands
were
shaking
then
forth
i
set
with
my
holly
staff
wishing
myself
well
out
of
it
i
was
shown
at
once
and
before
i
desired
it
into
his
majestys
presence
and
there
i
stood
most
humbly
and
made
the
best
bow
i
could
think
of
as
i
could
not
advance
any
fartherfor
i
saw
that
the
queen
was
present
which
frightened
me
tenfoldhis
majesty
in
the
most
gracious
manner
came
down
the
room
to
encourage
me
and
as
i
remained
with
my
head
bent
down
he
told
me
to
stand
up
and
look
at
him
i
have
seen
thee
before
young
man
he
said
thy
form
is
not
one
to
be
forgotten
where
was
it
thou
art
most
likely
to
know
may
it
please
your
most
gracious
majesty
the
king
i
answered
finding
my
voice
in
a
manner
which
surprised
myself
it
was
in
the
royal
chapel
now
i
meant
no
harm
whatever
by
this
i
ought
to
have
said
the
antechapel
but
i
could
not
remember
the
word
and
feared
to
keep
the
king
looking
at
me
i
am
wellpleased
said
his
majesty
with
a
smile
which
almost
made
his
dark
and
stubborn
face
look
pleasant
to
find
that
our
greatest
subject
greatest
i
mean
in
the
bodily
form
is
also
a
good
catholic
thou
needest
not
say
otherwise
the
time
shall
be
and
that
right
soon
when
men
shall
be
proud
of
the
one
true
faith
here
he
stopped
having
gone
rather
far
but
the
gleam
of
his
heavy
eyes
was
such
that
i
durst
not
contradict
this
is
that
great
johann
reed
said
her
majesty
coming
forward
because
the
king
was
in
meditation
for
whom
i
have
so
much
heard
from
the
dear
dear
lorna
ah
she
is
not
of
this
black
countree
she
is
of
the
breet
italie
i
have
tried
to
write
it
as
she
said
it
but
it
wants
a
better
scholar
to
express
her
mode
of
speech
now
john
ridd
said
the
king
recovering
from
his
thoughts
about
the
true
church
and
thinking
that
his
wife
was
not
to
take
the
lead
upon
me
thou
hast
done
great
service
to
the
realm
and
to
religion
it
was
good
to
save
earl
brandir
a
loyal
and
catholic
nobleman
but
it
was
great
service
to
catch
two
of
the
vilest
bloodhounds
ever
laid
on
by
heretics
and
to
make
them
shoot
one
another
it
was
rare
it
was
rare
my
lad
now
ask
us
anything
in
reason
thou
canst
carry
any
honours
on
thy
club
like
hercules
what
is
thy
chief
ambition
lad
well
said
i
after
thinking
a
little
and
meaning
to
make
the
most
of
it
for
so
the
queens
eyes
conveyed
to
me
my
mother
always
used
to
think
that
having
been
schooled
at
tiverton
with
thirty
marks
a
year
to
pay
i
was
worthy
of
a
coat
of
arms
and
that
is
what
she
longs
for
a
good
lad
a
very
good
lad
said
the
king
and
he
looked
at
the
queen
as
if
almost
in
joke
but
what
is
thy
condition
in
life
i
am
a
freeholder
i
answered
in
my
confusion
ever
since
the
time
of
king
alfred
a
ridd
was
with
him
in
the
isle
of
athelney
and
we
hold
our
farm
by
gift
from
him
or
at
least
people
say
so
we
have
had
three
very
good
harvests
running
and
might
support
a
coat
of
arms
but
for
myself
i
want
it
not
thou
shalt
have
a
coat
my
lad
said
the
king
smiling
at
his
own
humour
but
it
must
be
a
large
one
to
fit
thee
and
more
than
that
shalt
thou
have
john
ridd
being
of
such
loyal
breed
and
having
done
such
service
and
while
i
wondered
what
he
meant
he
called
to
some
of
the
people
in
waiting
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
they
brought
him
a
little
sword
such
as
annie
would
skewer
a
turkey
with
then
he
signified
to
me
to
kneel
which
i
did
after
dusting
the
board
for
the
sake
of
my
best
breeches
and
then
he
gave
me
a
little
tap
very
nicely
upon
my
shoulder
before
i
knew
what
he
was
up
to
and
said
arise
sir
john
ridd
this
astonished
and
amazed
me
to
such
extent
of
loss
of
mind
that
when
i
got
up
i
looked
about
and
thought
what
the
snowes
would
think
of
it
and
i
said
to
the
king
without
forms
of
speech
sir
i
am
very
much
obliged
but
what
be
i
to
do
with
it
chapter
lxix
not
to
be
put
up
with
the
coat
of
arms
devised
for
me
by
the
royal
heralds
was
of
great
size
and
rich
colours
and
full
of
bright
imaginings
they
did
me
the
honour
to
consult
me
first
and
to
take
no
notice
of
my
advice
for
i
begged
that
there
might
be
a
goodsized
cow
on
it
so
as
to
stamp
our
pats
of
butter
before
they
went
to
market
also
a
horse
on
the
other
side
and
a
flock
snowed
up
at
the
bottom
but
the
gentlemen
would
not
hear
of
this
and
to
find
something
more
appropriate
they
inquired
strictly
into
the
annals
of
our
family
i
told
them
of
course
all
about
king
alfred
upon
which
they
settled
that
one
quarter
should
be
three
cakes
on
a
bar
with
a
lion
regardant
done
upon
a
field
of
gold
also
i
told
them
that
very
likely
there
had
been
a
ridd
in
the
battle
fought
not
very
far
from
plovers
barrows
by
the
earl
of
devon
against
the
danes
when
hubba
their
chief
was
killed
and
the
sacred
standard
taken
as
some
of
the
danes
are
said
to
be
buried
even
upon
land
of
ours
and
we
call
their
graves
if
such
they
be
even
to
this
day
barrows
the
heralds
quite
agreed
with
me
that
a
ridd
might
have
been
there
or
thereabouts
and
if
he
was
there
he
was
almost
certain
to
have
done
his
best
being
in
sight
of
hearth
and
home
and
it
was
plain
that
he
must
have
had
good
legs
to
be
at
the
same
time
both
there
and
in
athelney
and
good
legs
are
an
argument
for
good
arms
and
supposing
a
man
of
this
sort
to
have
done
his
utmost
as
the
manner
of
the
ridds
is
it
was
next
to
certain
that
he
himself
must
have
captured
the
standard
moreover
the
name
of
our
farm
was
pure
proof
a
plover
being
a
wild
bird
just
the
same
as
a
raven
is
upon
this
chain
of
reasoning
and
without
any
weak
misgivings
they
charged
my
growing
escutcheon
with
a
black
raven
on
a
ground
of
red
and
the
next
thing
which
i
mentioned
possessing
absolute
certainty
to
wit
that
a
pig
with
two
heads
had
been
born
upon
our
farm
not
more
than
two
hundred
years
agone
although
he
died
within
a
week
my
third
quarter
was
made
at
once
by
a
twoheaded
boar
with
noble
tusks
sable
upon
silver
all
this
was
very
fierce
and
fine
and
so
i
pressed
for
a
peaceful
corner
in
the
lower
dexter
and
obtained
a
wheatsheaf
set
upright
gold
upon
a
field
of
green
here
i
was
inclined
to
pause
and
admire
the
effect
for
even
de
whichehalse
could
not
show
a
bearing
so
magnificent
but
the
heralds
said
that
it
looked
a
mere
signboard
without
a
good
motto
under
it
and
the
motto
must
have
my
name
in
it
they
offered
me
first
ridd
non
ridendus
but
i
said
for
gods
sake
gentlemen
let
me
forget
my
latin
then
they
proposed
ridd
readeth
riddles
but
i
begged
them
not
to
set
down
such
a
lie
for
no
ridd
ever
had
made
or
made
out
such
a
thing
as
a
riddle
since
exmoor
itself
began
thirdly
they
gave
me
ridd
never
be
ridden
and
fearing
to
make
any
further
objections
i
let
them
inscribe
it
in
bronze
upon
blue
the
heralds
thought
that
the
king
would
pay
for
this
noble
achievement
but
his
majesty
although
graciously
pleased
with
their
ingenuity
declined
in
the
most
decided
manner
to
pay
a
farthing
towards
it
and
as
i
had
now
no
money
left
the
heralds
became
as
blue
as
azure
and
as
red
as
gules
until
her
majesty
the
queen
came
forward
very
kindly
and
said
that
if
his
majesty
gave
me
a
coat
of
arms
i
was
not
to
pay
for
it
therefore
she
herself
did
so
quite
handsomely
and
felt
goodwill
towards
me
in
consequence
now
being
in
a
hurryso
far
at
least
as
it
is
in
my
nature
to
hurryto
get
to
the
end
of
this
narrative
is
it
likely
that
i
would
have
dwelled
so
long
upon
my
coat
of
arms
but
for
some
good
reason
and
this
good
reason
is
that
lorna
took
the
greatest
pride
in
it
and
thought
or
at
any
rate
said
that
it
quite
threw
into
the
shade
and
eclipsed
all
her
own
ancient
glories
and
half
in
fun
and
half
in
earnest
she
called
me
sir
john
so
continually
that
at
last
i
was
almost
angry
with
her
until
her
eyes
were
bedewed
with
tears
and
then
i
was
angry
with
myself
beginning
to
be
short
of
money
and
growing
anxious
about
the
farm
longing
also
to
show
myself
and
my
noble
escutcheon
to
mother
i
took
advantage
of
lady
lornas
interest
with
the
queen
to
obtain
my
acquittance
and
full
discharge
from
even
nominal
custody
it
had
been
intended
to
keep
me
in
waiting
until
the
return
of
lord
jeffreys
from
that
awful
circuit
of
shambles
through
which
his
name
is
still
used
by
mothers
to
frighten
their
children
into
bed
and
right
glad
was
ifor
even
london
shrank
with
horror
at
the
newsto
escape
a
man
so
bloodthirsty
savage
and
even
to
his
friends
among
whom
i
was
reckoned
malignant
earl
brandir
was
greatly
pleased
with
me
not
only
for
having
saved
his
life
but
for
saving
that
which
he
valued
more
the
wealth
laid
by
for
lord
alan
and
he
introduced
me
to
many
great
people
who
quite
kindly
encouraged
me
and
promised
to
help
me
in
every
way
when
they
heard
how
the
king
had
spoken
as
for
the
furrier
he
could
never
have
enough
of
my
society
and
this
worthy
man
praying
my
commendation
demanded
of
me
one
thing
onlyto
speak
of
him
as
i
found
him
as
i
had
found
him
many
a
sunday
furbishing
up
old
furs
for
new
with
a
glaze
to
conceal
the
moths
ravages
i
begged
him
to
reconsider
the
point
and
not
to
demand
such
accuracy
he
said
well
well
all
trades
had
tricks
especially
the
trick
of
business
and
i
must
take
himif
i
were
his
true
friendaccording
to
his
own
description
this
i
was
glad
enough
to
do
because
it
saved
so
much
trouble
and
i
had
no
money
to
spend
with
him
but
still
he
requested
the
use
of
my
name
and
i
begged
him
to
do
the
best
with
it
as
i
never
had
kept
a
banker
and
the
john
ridd
cuffs
and
the
sir
john
mantles
and
the
hollystaff
capes
he
put
into
his
window
as
the
winter
was
coming
on
ay
and
sold
for
everybody
was
burning
with
gossip
about
me
must
have
made
this
good
mans
fortune
since
the
excess
of
price
over
value
is
the
true
test
of
success
in
life
to
come
away
from
all
this
stuff
which
grieves
a
man
in
londonwhen
the
brisk
air
of
the
autumn
cleared
its
way
to
ludgate
hill
and
clever
prentices
ran
out
and
sniffed
at
it
and
fed
upon
it
having
little
else
to
eat
and
when
the
horses
from
the
country
were
a
goodly
sight
to
see
with
the
rasp
of
winter
bristles
rising
through
and
among
the
soft
summercoat
and
when
the
new
straw
began
to
come
in
golden
with
the
harvest
gloss
and
smelling
most
divinely
at
those
strange
liverystables
where
the
nags
are
put
quite
tail
to
tail
and
when
all
the
london
folk
themselves
are
asking
about
white
frost
from
recollections
of
childhood
then
i
say
such
a
yearning
seized
me
for
moory
crag
and
for
dewy
blade
and
even
the
grunting
of
our
sheep
when
the
sun
goes
down
that
nothing
but
the
new
wisps
of
samson
could
have
held
me
in
london
town
lorna
was
moved
with
equal
longing
towards
the
country
and
country
ways
and
she
spoke
quite
as
much
of
the
glistening
dew
as
she
did
of
the
smell
of
our
oven
and
here
let
me
mentionalthough
the
two
are
quite
distinct
and
differentthat
both
the
dew
and
the
bread
of
exmoor
may
be
sought
whether
high
or
low
but
never
found
elsewhere
the
dew
is
so
crisp
and
pure
and
pearly
and
in
such
abundance
and
the
bread
is
so
sweet
so
kind
and
homely
you
can
eat
a
loaf
and
then
another
now
while
i
was
walking
daily
in
and
out
great
crowds
of
men
few
of
whom
had
any
freedom
from
the
cares
of
money
and
many
of
whom
were
even
morbid
with
a
worse
pest
called
politics
i
could
not
be
quit
of
thinking
how
we
jostle
one
another
god
has
made
the
earth
quite
large
with
a
spread
of
land
large
enough
for
all
to
live
on
without
fighting
also
a
mighty
spread
of
water
laying
hands
on
sand
and
cliff
with
a
solemn
voice
in
stormtime
and
in
the
gentle
weather
moving
men
to
thoughts
of
equity
this
as
well
is
full
of
food
being
twothirds
of
the
world
and
reserved
for
devouring
knowledge
by
the
time
the
sons
of
men
have
fed
away
the
dry
land
yet
before
the
land
itself
has
acknowledged
touch
of
man
upon
one
in
a
hundred
acres
and
before
one
mile
in
ten
thousand
of
the
exhaustless
ocean
has
ever
felt
the
plunge
of
hook
or
combing
of
the
haulnets
lo
we
crawl
in
flocks
together
upon
the
hot
ground
that
stings
us
even
as
the
black
grubs
crowd
upon
the
harried
nettle
surely
we
are
too
much
given
to
follow
the
tracks
of
each
other
however
for
a
moralist
i
never
set
up
and
never
shall
while
common
sense
abides
with
me
such
a
man
must
be
very
wretched
in
this
pure
dearth
of
morality
like
a
fisherman
where
no
fish
be
and
most
of
us
have
enough
to
do
to
attend
to
our
own
morals
enough
that
i
resolved
to
go
and
as
lorna
could
not
come
with
me
it
was
even
worse
than
stopping
nearly
everybody
vowed
that
i
was
a
great
fool
indeed
to
neglect
so
rudelywhich
was
the
proper
word
they
saidthe
pushing
of
my
fortunes
but
i
answered
that
to
push
was
rude
and
i
left
it
to
people
who
had
no
room
and
thought
that
my
fortune
must
be
heavy
if
it
would
not
move
without
pushing
lorna
cried
when
i
came
away
which
gave
me
great
satisfaction
and
she
sent
a
whole
trunkful
of
things
for
mother
and
annie
and
even
lizzie
and
she
seemed
to
think
though
she
said
it
not
that
i
made
my
own
occasion
for
going
and
might
have
stayed
on
till
the
winter
whereas
i
knew
well
that
my
mother
would
think
and
every
one
on
the
farm
the
same
that
here
i
had
been
in
london
lagging
and
taking
my
pleasure
and
looking
at
shops
upon
pretence
of
kings
business
and
leaving
the
harvest
to
reap
itself
not
to
mention
the
spending
of
money
while
all
the
time
there
was
nothing
whatever
except
my
own
love
of
adventure
and
sport
to
keep
me
from
coming
home
again
but
i
knew
that
my
coat
of
arms
and
title
would
turn
every
bit
of
this
grumbling
into
fine
admiration
and
so
it
fell
out
to
a
greater
extent
than
even
i
desired
for
all
the
parishes
round
about
united
in
a
sumptuous
dinner
at
the
mother
melldrum
innfor
now
that
good
lady
was
dead
and
her
name
and
face
set
on
a
signpostto
which
i
was
invited
so
that
it
was
as
good
as
a
summons
and
if
my
health
was
no
better
next
day
it
was
not
from
want
of
good
wishes
any
more
than
from
stint
of
the
liquor
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
real
gentry
for
a
long
time
treated
my
new
honours
with
contempt
and
ridicule
but
gradually
as
they
found
that
i
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
claim
any
equality
with
them
but
went
about
my
farmwork
and
threw
another
man
at
wrestling
and
touched
my
hat
to
the
magistrates
just
the
same
as
ever
some
gentlemen
of
the
highest
bloodof
which
we
think
a
great
deal
more
than
of
gold
around
our
neighbourhoodactually
expressed
a
desire
to
make
my
acquaintance
and
when
in
a
manner
quite
straightforward
and
wholly
free
from
bitterness
i
thanked
them
for
this
which
appeared
to
me
the
highest
honour
yet
offered
me
but
declined
to
go
into
their
company
because
it
would
make
me
uncomfortable
and
themselves
as
well
in
a
different
way
they
did
what
nearly
all
englishmen
do
when
a
thing
is
right
and
sensible
they
shook
hands
with
me
and
said
that
they
could
not
deny
but
that
there
was
reason
in
my
view
of
the
matter
and
although
they
themselves
must
be
the
loserswhich
was
a
handsome
thing
to
saythey
would
wait
until
i
was
a
little
older
and
more
aware
of
my
own
value
now
this
reminds
me
how
it
is
that
an
english
gentleman
is
so
far
in
front
of
foreign
noblemen
and
princes
i
have
seen
at
times
a
little
both
of
one
and
of
the
other
and
making
more
than
due
allowance
for
the
difficulties
of
language
and
the
difference
of
training
upon
the
whole
the
balance
is
in
favour
of
our
people
and
this
because
we
have
two
weights
solid
and
even
in
scale
of
manners
outweighing
all
light
complaisance
to
wit
the
inborn
love
of
justice
and
the
power
of
abiding
yet
some
people
may
be
surprised
that
men
with
any
love
of
justice
whether
inborn
or
otherwise
could
continue
to
abide
the
arrogance
and
rapacity
and
tyranny
of
the
doones
for
now
as
the
winter
passed
the
doones
were
not
keeping
themselves
at
home
as
in
honour
they
were
bound
to
do
twenty
sheep
a
week
and
one
fat
ox
and
two
stout
red
deer
for
wholesome
change
of
diet
as
well
as
threescore
bushels
of
flour
and
two
hogsheads
and
a
half
of
cider
and
a
hundredweight
of
candles
not
to
mention
other
things
of
almost
every
variety
which
they
got
by
insisting
upon
itsurely
these
might
have
sufficed
to
keep
the
people
in
their
place
with
no
outburst
of
wantonness
nevertheless
it
was
not
so
they
had
made
complaint
about
somethingtoo
much
ewemutton
i
think
it
wasand
in
spite
of
all
the
pledges
given
they
had
ridden
forth
and
carried
away
two
maidens
of
our
neighbourhood
now
these
two
maidens
were
known
because
they
had
served
the
beer
at
an
alehouse
and
many
men
who
had
looked
at
them
over
a
pint
or
quart
vessel
especially
as
they
were
comely
girls
thought
that
it
was
very
hard
for
them
to
go
in
that
way
and
perhaps
themselves
unwilling
and
their
mother
although
she
had
taken
some
money
which
the
doones
were
always
full
of
declared
that
it
was
a
robbery
and
though
it
increased
for
a
while
the
custom
that
must
soon
fall
off
again
and
who
would
have
her
two
girls
now
clever
as
they
were
and
good
before
we
had
finished
meditating
upon
this
loose
outragefor
so
i
at
least
would
call
it
though
people
accustomed
to
the
law
may
take
a
different
view
of
itwe
had
news
of
a
thing
far
worse
which
turned
the
hearts
of
our
women
sick
this
i
will
tell
in
most
careful
language
so
as
to
give
offence
to
none
if
skill
of
words
may
help
it

the
following
story
is
strictly
true
and
true
it
is
that
the
countrypeople
rose
to
a
man
at
this
dastard
cruelty
and
did
what
the
government
failed
to
doed
mistress
margery
badcock
a
healthy
and
upright
young
woman
with
a
good
rich
colour
and
one
of
the
finest
henroosts
anywhere
round
our
neighbourhood
was
nursing
her
child
about
six
of
the
clock
and
looking
out
for
her
husband
now
this
child
was
too
old
to
be
nursed
as
everybody
told
her
for
he
could
run
say
two
yards
alone
and
perhaps
four
or
five
by
holding
to
handles
and
he
had
a
way
of
looking
round
and
spreading
his
legs
and
laughing
with
his
brave
little
body
well
fetched
up
after
a
desperate
journey
to
the
end
of
the
table
which
his
mother
said
nothing
could
equal
nevertheless
he
would
come
to
be
nursed
as
regular
as
a
clock
almost
and
inasmuch
as
he
was
the
first
both
father
and
mother
made
much
of
him
for
god
only
knew
whether
they
could
ever
compass
such
another
one
christopher
badcock
was
a
tenant
farmer
in
the
parish
of
martinhoe
renting
some
fifty
acres
of
land
with
a
right
of
common
attached
to
them
and
at
this
particular
time
being
now
the
month
of
february
and
fine
open
weather
he
was
hard
at
work
ploughing
and
preparing
for
spring
corn
therefore
his
wife
was
not
surprised
although
the
dusk
was
falling
that
farmer
christopher
should
be
at
work
in
blind
mans
holiday
as
we
call
it
but
she
was
surprised
nay
astonished
when
by
the
light
of
the
kitchen
fire
brightened
up
for
her
husband
she
saw
six
or
seven
great
armed
men
burst
into
the
room
upon
her
and
she
screamed
so
that
the
maid
in
the
back
kitchen
heard
her
but
was
afraid
to
come
to
help
two
of
the
strongest
and
fiercest
men
at
once
seized
poor
young
margery
and
though
she
fought
for
her
child
and
home
she
was
but
an
infant
herself
in
their
hands
in
spite
of
tears
and
shrieks
and
struggles
they
tore
the
babe
from
the
mothers
arms
and
cast
it
on
the
lime
ash
floor
then
they
bore
her
away
to
their
horses
for
by
this
time
she
was
senseless
and
telling
the
others
to
sack
the
house
rode
off
with
their
prize
to
the
valley
and
from
the
description
of
one
of
those
two
who
carried
off
the
poor
woman
i
knew
beyond
all
doubt
that
it
was
carver
doone
himself
the
other
doones
being
left
behind
and
grieved
perhaps
in
some
respects
set
to
with
a
will
to
scour
the
house
and
to
bring
away
all
that
was
good
to
eat
and
being
a
little
vexed
herein
for
the
badcocks
were
not
a
rich
couple
and
finding
no
more
than
bacon
and
eggs
and
cheese
and
little
items
and
nothing
to
drink
but
water
in
a
word
their
taste
being
offended
they
came
back
to
the
kitchen
and
stamped
and
there
was
the
baby
lying
by
evil
luck
this
child
began
to
squeal
about
his
mother
having
been
petted
hitherto
and
wont
to
get
all
he
wanted
by
raising
his
voice
but
a
little
now
the
mark
of
the
floor
was
upon
his
head
as
the
maid
who
had
stolen
to
look
at
him
when
the
rough
men
were
swearing
upstairs
gave
evidence
and
she
put
a
dishcloth
under
his
head
and
kissed
him
and
ran
away
again
her
name
was
honour
jose
and
she
meant
what
was
right
by
her
master
and
mistress
but
could
not
help
being
frightened
and
many
women
have
blamed
her
as
i
think
unduly
for
her
mode
of
forsaking
baby
so
if
it
had
been
her
own
baby
instinct
rather
than
reason
might
have
had
the
day
with
her
but
the
child
being
born
of
her
mistress
she
wished
him
good
luck
and
left
him
as
the
fierce
men
came
downstairs
and
being
alarmed
by
their
power
of
language
because
they
had
found
no
silver
she
crept
away
in
a
breathless
hurry
and
afraid
how
her
breath
might
come
back
to
her
for
oftentime
she
had
hiccoughs
while
this
good
maid
was
in
the
oven
by
side
of
backkitchen
fireplace
with
a
faggot
of
wood
drawn
over
her
and
lying
so
that
her
own
heart
beat
worse
than
if
she
were
baking
the
men
as
i
said
before
came
downstairs
and
stamped
around
the
baby
rowland
is
the
bacon
good
one
of
them
asked
with
an
oath
or
two
it
is
too
bad
of
carver
to
go
off
with
the
only
prize
and
leave
us
in
a
starving
cottage
and
not
enough
to
eat
for
two
of
us
fetch
down
the
staves
of
the
rack
my
boy
what
was
farmer
to
have
for
supper
naught
but
an
onion
or
two
and
a
loaf
and
a
rasher
of
rusty
bacon
these
poor
devils
live
so
badly
they
are
not
worth
robbing
no
game
then
let
us
have
a
game
of
loriot
with
the
baby
it
will
be
the
best
thing
that
could
befall
a
lusty
infant
heretic
ride
a
cockhorse
to
banbury
cross
bye
bye
baby
bunting
toss
him
up
and
let
me
see
if
my
wrist
be
steady
the
cruelty
of
this
man
is
a
thing
it
makes
me
sick
to
speak
of
enough
that
when
the
poor
baby
fell
without
attempt
at
cry
or
scream
thinking
it
part
of
his
usual
play
when
they
tossed
him
up
to
come
down
again
the
maid
in
the
oven
of
the
backkitchen
not
being
any
door
between
heard
them
say
as
follows
if
any
man
asketh
who
killed
thee
say
twas
the
doones
of
bagworthy


always
pronounced
badgery
now
i
think
that
when
we
heard
this
story
and
poor
kit
badcock
came
all
around
in
a
sort
of
halfcrazy
manner
not
looking
up
at
any
one
but
dropping
his
eyes
and
asking
whether
we
thought
he
had
been
welltreated
and
seeming
void
of
regard
for
life
if
this
were
all
the
style
of
it
then
having
known
him
a
lusty
man
and
a
fine
singer
in
an
alehouse
and
much
inclined
to
lay
down
the
law
as
show
a
high
hand
about
women
i
really
think
that
it
moved
us
more
than
if
he
had
gone
about
ranting
and
raving
and
vowing
revenge
upon
every
one
chapter
lxx
compelled
to
volunteer
there
had
been
some
trouble
in
our
own
home
during
the
previous
autumn
while
yet
i
was
in
london
for
certain
noted
fugitives
from
the
army
of
king
monmouth
which
he
himself
had
deserted
in
a
low
and
currish
manner
having
failed
to
obtain
free
shipment
from
the
coast
near
watersmouth
had
returned
into
the
wilds
of
exmoor
trusting
to
lurk
and
be
comforted
among
the
common
people
neither
were
they
disappointed
for
a
certain
length
of
time
nor
in
the
end
was
their
disappointment
caused
by
fault
on
our
part
major
wade
was
one
of
them
an
active
and
wellmeaning
man
but
prone
to
fail
in
courage
upon
lasting
trial
although
in
a
moment
ready
squire
john
whichehalse
not
the
baron
and
parson
powell
caught
him
two
or
three
months
before
my
return
in
farley
farmhouse
near
brendon
he
had
been
up
at
our
house
several
times
and
lizzie
thought
a
great
deal
of
him
and
well
i
know
that
if
at
that
time
i
had
been
in
the
neighbourhood
he
should
not
have
been
taken
so
easily

not
our
parson
bowden
nor
any
more
a
friend
of
his
our
parson
bowden
never
had
naught
whatever
to
do
with
it
and
never
smoked
a
pipe
with
parson
powell
after
itjr
john
birch
the
farmer
who
had
sheltered
him
was
so
fearful
of
punishment
that
he
hanged
himself
in
a
few
days
time
and
even
before
he
was
apprehended
but
nothing
was
done
to
grace
howe
of
bridgeball
who
had
been
wades
greatest
comforter
neither
was
anything
done
to
us
although
eliza
had
added
greatly
to
mothers
alarm
and
danger
by
falling
upon
rector
powell
and
most
soundly
rating
him
for
his
meanness
and
his
cruelty
and
cowardice
as
she
called
it
in
setting
men
with
firearms
upon
a
poor
helpless
fugitive
and
robbing
all
our
neighbourhood
of
its
fame
for
hospitality
however
by
means
of
sergeant
bloxham
and
his
good
report
of
us
as
well
as
by
virtue
of
wades
confession
which
proved
of
use
to
the
government
my
mother
escaped
all
penalties
it
is
likely
enough
that
good
folk
will
think
it
hard
upon
our
neighbourhood
to
be
threatened
and
sometimes
heavily
punished
for
kindness
and
humanity
and
yet
to
be
left
to
help
ourselves
against
tyranny
and
base
rapine
and
now
at
last
our
gorge
was
risen
and
our
hearts
in
tumult
we
had
borne
our
troubles
long
as
a
wise
and
wholesome
chastisement
quite
content
to
have
some
few
things
of
our
own
unmeddled
with
but
what
could
a
man
dare
to
call
his
own
or
what
right
could
he
have
to
wish
for
it
while
he
left
his
wife
and
children
at
the
pleasure
of
any
stranger
the
people
came
flocking
all
around
me
at
the
blacksmiths
forge
and
the
brendon
alehouse
and
i
could
scarce
come
out
of
church
but
they
got
me
among
the
tombstones
they
all
agreed
that
i
was
bound
to
take
command
and
management
i
bade
them
go
to
the
magistrates
but
they
said
they
had
been
too
often
then
i
told
them
that
i
had
no
wits
for
ordering
of
an
armament
although
i
could
find
fault
enough
with
the
one
which
had
not
succeeded
but
they
would
hearken
to
none
of
this
all
they
said
was
try
to
lead
us
and
we
will
try
not
to
run
away
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
common
sense
and
good
stuff
instead
of
mere
bragging
moreover
i
myself
was
moved
by
the
bitter
wrongs
of
margery
having
known
her
at
the
sundayschool
ere
ever
i
went
to
tiverton
and
having
in
those
days
serious
thoughts
of
making
her
my
sweetheart
although
she
was
three
years
my
elder
but
now
i
felt
this
difficultythe
doones
had
behaved
very
well
to
our
farm
and
to
mother
and
all
of
us
while
i
was
away
in
london
therefore
would
it
not
be
shabby
and
mean
for
me
to
attack
them
now
yet
being
pressed
still
harder
and
harder
as
day
by
day
the
excitement
grew
with
more
and
more
talking
over
it
and
no
one
else
coming
forward
to
undertake
the
business
i
agreed
at
last
to
this
that
if
the
doones
upon
fair
challenge
would
not
endeavour
to
make
amends
by
giving
up
mistress
margery
as
well
as
the
man
who
had
slain
the
babe
then
i
would
lead
the
expedition
and
do
my
best
to
subdue
them
all
our
men
were
content
with
this
being
thoroughly
well
assured
from
experience
that
the
haughty
robbers
would
only
shoot
any
man
who
durst
approach
them
with
such
proposal
and
then
arose
a
difficult
questionwho
was
to
take
the
risk
of
making
overtures
so
unpleasant
i
waited
for
the
rest
to
offer
and
as
none
was
ready
the
burden
fell
on
me
and
seemed
to
be
of
my
own
inviting
hence
i
undertook
the
task
sooner
than
reason
about
it
for
to
give
the
cause
of
everything
is
worse
than
to
go
through
with
it
it
may
have
been
three
of
the
afternoon
when
leaving
my
witnesses
behind
for
they
preferred
the
background
i
appeared
with
our
lizzies
white
handkerchief
upon
a
kidneybean
stick
at
the
entrance
to
the
robbers
dwelling
scarce
knowing
what
might
come
of
it
i
had
taken
the
wise
precaution
of
fastening
a
bible
over
my
heart
and
another
across
my
spinal
column
in
case
of
having
to
run
away
with
rude
men
shooting
after
me
for
my
mother
said
that
the
word
of
god
would
stop
a
twoinch
bullet
with
three
ounces
of
powder
behind
it
now
i
took
no
weapons
save
those
of
the
spirit
for
fear
of
being
misunderstood
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
think
that
any
of
honourable
birth
would
take
advantage
of
an
unarmed
man
coming
in
guise
of
peace
to
them
and
this
conclusion
of
mine
held
good
at
least
for
a
certain
length
of
time
inasmuch
as
two
decent
doones
appeared
and
hearing
of
my
purpose
offered
without
violence
to
go
and
fetch
the
captain
if
i
would
stop
where
i
was
and
not
begin
to
spy
about
anything
to
this
of
course
i
agreed
at
once
for
i
wanted
no
more
spying
because
i
had
thorough
knowledge
of
all
ins
and
outs
already
therefore
i
stood
waiting
steadily
with
one
hand
in
my
pocket
feeling
a
sample
of
corn
for
market
and
the
other
against
the
rock
while
i
wondered
to
see
it
so
brown
already
those
men
came
back
in
a
little
while
with
a
sharp
short
message
that
captain
carver
would
come
out
and
speak
to
me
byandby
when
his
pipe
was
finished
accordingly
i
waited
long
and
we
talked
about
the
signs
of
bloom
for
the
coming
apple
season
and
the
rain
that
had
fallen
last
wednesday
night
and
the
principal
dearth
of
devonshire
that
it
will
not
grow
many
cowslipswhich
we
quite
agreed
to
be
the
prettiest
of
spring
flowers
and
all
the
time
i
was
wondering
how
many
black
and
deadly
deeds
these
two
innocent
youths
had
committed
even
since
last
christmas
at
length
a
heavy
and
haughty
step
sounded
along
the
stone
roof
of
the
way
and
then
the
great
carver
doone
drew
up
and
looked
at
me
rather
scornfully
not
with
any
spoken
scorn
nor
flash
of
strong
contumely
but
with
that
air
of
thinking
little
and
praying
not
to
be
troubled
which
always
vexes
a
man
who
feels
that
he
ought
not
to
be
despised
so
and
yet
knows
not
how
to
help
it
what
is
it
you
want
young
man
he
asked
as
if
he
had
never
seen
me
before
in
spite
of
that
strong
loathing
which
i
always
felt
at
sight
of
him
i
commanded
my
temper
moderately
and
told
him
that
i
was
come
for
his
good
and
that
of
his
worshipful
company
far
more
than
for
my
own
that
a
general
feeling
of
indignation
had
arisen
among
us
at
the
recent
behaviour
of
certain
young
men
for
which
he
might
not
be
answerable
and
for
which
we
would
not
condemn
him
without
knowing
the
rights
of
the
question
but
i
begged
him
clearly
to
understand
that
a
vile
and
inhuman
wrong
had
been
done
and
such
as
we
could
not
put
up
with
but
that
if
he
would
make
what
amends
he
could
by
restoring
the
poor
woman
and
giving
up
that
odious
brute
who
had
slain
the
harmless
infant
we
would
take
no
further
motion
and
things
should
go
on
as
usual
as
i
put
this
in
the
fewest
words
that
would
meet
my
purpose
i
was
grieved
to
see
a
disdainful
smile
spread
on
his
sallow
countenance
then
he
made
me
a
bow
of
mock
courtesy
and
replied
as
follows
sir
john
your
new
honours
have
turned
your
poor
head
as
might
have
been
expected
we
are
not
in
the
habit
of
deserting
anything
that
belongs
to
us
far
less
our
sacred
relatives
the
insolence
of
your
demand
wellnigh
outdoes
the
ingratitude
if
there
be
a
man
upon
exmoor
who
has
grossly
illused
us
kidnapped
our
young
women
and
slain
half
a
dozen
of
our
young
men
you
are
that
outrageous
rogue
sir
john
and
after
all
this
how
have
we
behaved
we
have
laid
no
hand
upon
your
farm
we
have
not
carried
off
your
women
we
have
even
allowed
you
to
take
our
queen
by
creeping
and
crawling
treachery
and
we
have
given
you
leave
of
absence
to
help
your
cousin
the
highwayman
and
to
come
home
with
a
title
and
now
how
do
you
requite
us
by
inflaming
the
boorish
indignation
at
a
little
frolic
of
our
young
men
and
by
coming
with
insolent
demands
to
yield
to
which
would
ruin
us
ah
you
ungrateful
viper
as
he
turned
away
in
sorrow
from
me
shaking
his
head
at
my
badness
i
became
so
overcome
never
having
been
quite
assured
even
by
peoples
praises
about
my
own
goodness
moreover
the
light
which
he
threw
upon
things
differed
so
greatly
from
my
own
that
in
a
wordnot
to
be
too
longi
feared
that
i
was
a
villain
and
with
many
bitter
pangsfor
i
have
bad
things
to
repent
ofi
began
at
my
leisure
to
ask
myself
whether
or
not
this
bill
of
indictment
against
john
ridd
was
true
some
of
it
i
knew
to
be
however
much
i
condemned
myself
altogether
out
of
reason
for
instance
about
my
going
away
with
lorna
very
quietly
over
the
snow
and
to
save
my
love
from
being
starved
away
from
me
in
this
there
was
no
creeping
neither
crawling
treachery
for
all
was
done
with
sliding
and
yet
i
was
so
out
of
training
for
being
charged
by
other
people
beyond
mine
own
conscience
that
carver
doones
harsh
words
came
on
me
like
prickly
spinach
sown
with
raking
therefore
i
replied
and
said
it
is
true
that
i
owe
you
gratitude
sir
for
a
certain
time
of
forbearance
and
it
is
to
prove
my
gratitude
that
i
am
come
here
now
i
do
not
think
that
my
evil
deeds
can
be
set
against
your
own
although
i
cannot
speak
flowingly
upon
my
good
deeds
as
you
can
i
took
your
queen
because
you
starved
her
having
stolen
her
long
before
and
killed
her
mother
and
brother
this
is
not
for
me
to
dwell
upon
now
any
more
than
i
would
say
much
about
your
murdering
of
my
father
but
how
the
balance
hangs
between
us
god
knows
better
than
thou
or
i
thou
low
miscreant
carver
doone
i
had
worked
myself
up
as
i
always
do
in
the
manner
of
heavy
men
growing
hot
like
an
illwashered
wheel
revolving
though
i
start
with
a
cool
axle
and
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
for
heat
and
ready
to
ask
pardon
but
carver
doone
regarded
me
with
a
noble
and
fearless
grandeur
i
have
given
thee
thy
choice
john
ridd
he
said
in
a
lofty
manner
which
made
me
drop
away
under
him
i
always
wish
to
do
my
best
with
the
worst
people
who
come
near
me
and
of
all
i
have
ever
met
with
thou
art
the
very
worst
sir
john
and
the
most
dishonest
now
after
all
my
labouring
to
pay
every
man
to
a
penny
and
to
allow
the
women
over
when
among
the
couchgrass
which
is
a
sad
thing
for
their
gowns
to
be
charged
like
this
i
say
so
amazed
me
that
i
stood
with
my
legs
quite
open
and
ready
for
an
earthquake
and
the
scornful
way
in
which
he
said
sir
john
went
to
my
very
heart
reminding
me
of
my
littleness
but
seeing
no
use
in
bandying
words
nay
rather
the
chance
of
mischief
i
did
my
best
to
look
calmly
at
him
and
to
say
with
a
quiet
voice
farewell
carver
doone
this
time
our
day
of
reckoning
is
nigh
thou
fool
it
is
come
he
cried
leaping
aside
into
the
niche
of
rock
by
the
doorway
fire
save
for
the
quickness
of
spring
and
readiness
learned
in
many
a
wrestling
bout
that
knavish
trick
must
have
ended
me
but
scarce
was
the
word
fire
out
of
his
mouth
ere
i
was
out
of
fire
by
a
single
bound
behind
the
rocky
pillar
of
the
opening
in
this
jump
i
was
so
brisk
at
impulse
of
the
love
of
life
for
i
saw
the
muzzles
set
upon
me
from
the
darkness
of
the
cavern
that
the
men
who
had
trained
their
guns
upon
me
with
goodwill
and
daintiness
could
not
check
their
fingers
crooked
upon
the
heavy
triggers
and
the
volley
sang
with
a
roar
behind
it
down
the
avenue
of
crags
with
one
thing
and
another
and
most
of
all
the
treachery
of
this
dastard
scheme
i
was
so
amazed
that
i
turned
and
ran
at
the
very
top
of
my
speed
away
from
these
vile
fellows
and
luckily
for
me
they
had
not
another
charge
to
send
after
me
and
thus
by
good
fortune
i
escaped
but
with
a
bitter
heart
and
mind
at
their
treacherous
usage
without
any
further
hesitation
i
agreed
to
take
command
of
the
honest
men
who
were
burning
to
punish
ay
and
destroy
those
outlaws
as
now
beyond
all
bearing
one
condition
however
i
made
namely
that
the
counsellor
should
be
spared
if
possible
not
because
he
was
less
a
villain
than
any
of
the
others
but
that
he
seemed
less
violent
and
above
all
had
been
good
to
annie
and
i
found
hard
work
to
make
them
listen
to
my
wish
upon
this
point
for
of
all
the
doones
sir
counsellor
had
made
himself
most
hated
by
his
love
of
law
and
reason
we
arranged
that
all
our
men
should
come
and
fall
into
order
with
pike
and
musket
over
against
our
dunghill
and
we
settled
early
in
the
day
that
their
wives
might
come
and
look
at
them
for
most
of
these
men
had
good
wives
quite
different
from
sweethearts
such
as
the
militia
had
women
indeed
who
could
hold
to
a
man
and
see
to
him
and
bury
himif
his
luck
were
eviland
perhaps
have
no
one
afterwards
and
all
these
women
pressed
their
rights
upon
their
precious
husbands
and
brought
so
many
children
with
them
and
made
such
a
fuss
and
hugging
and
racing
after
little
legs
that
our
farmyard
might
be
taken
for
an
outdoor
school
for
babies
rather
than
a
review
ground
i
myself
was
to
and
fro
among
the
children
continually
for
if
i
love
anything
in
the
world
foremost
i
love
children
they
warm
and
yet
they
cool
our
hearts
as
we
think
of
what
we
were
and
what
in
young
clothes
we
hoped
to
be
and
how
many
things
have
come
across
and
to
see
our
motives
moving
in
the
little
things
that
know
not
what
their
aim
or
object
is
must
almost
or
ought
at
least
to
lead
us
home
and
soften
us
for
either
end
of
life
is
home
both
source
and
issue
being
god
nevertheless
i
must
confess
that
the
children
were
a
plague
sometimes
they
never
could
have
enough
of
mebeing
a
hundred
to
one
you
might
saybut
i
had
more
than
enough
of
them
and
yet
was
not
contented
for
they
had
so
many
ways
of
talking
and
of
tugging
at
my
hair
and
of
sitting
upon
my
neck
not
even
two
with
their
legs
alike
and
they
forced
me
to
jump
so
vehemently
seeming
to
court
the
peril
of
my
coming
down
neck
and
crop
with
them
and
urging
me
still
to
go
faster
however
fast
i
might
go
with
them
i
assure
you
that
they
were
sometimes
so
hard
and
tyrannical
over
me
that
i
might
almost
as
well
have
been
among
the
very
doones
themselves
nevertheless
the
way
in
which
the
children
made
me
useful
proved
also
of
some
use
to
me
for
their
mothers
were
so
pleased
by
the
exertions
of
the
great
geegeeas
all
the
small
ones
entitled
methat
they
gave
me
unlimited
power
and
authority
over
their
husbands
moreover
they
did
their
utmost
among
their
relatives
round
about
to
fetch
recruits
for
our
little
band
and
by
such
means
several
of
the
yeomanry
from
barnstaple
and
from
tiverton
were
added
to
our
number
and
inasmuch
as
these
were
armed
with
heavy
swords
and
short
carabines
their
appearance
was
truly
formidable
tom
faggus
also
joined
us
heartily
being
now
quite
healed
of
his
wound
except
at
times
when
the
wind
was
easterly
he
was
made
second
in
command
to
me
and
i
would
gladly
have
had
him
first
as
more
fertile
in
expedients
but
he
declined
such
rank
on
the
plea
that
i
knew
most
of
the
seat
of
war
besides
that
i
might
be
held
in
some
measure
to
draw
authority
from
the
king
also
uncle
ben
came
over
to
help
us
with
his
advice
and
presence
as
well
as
with
a
band
of
stout
warehousemen
whom
he
brought
from
dulverton
for
he
had
never
forgiven
the
old
outrage
put
upon
him
and
though
it
had
been
to
his
interest
to
keep
quiet
during
the
last
attack
under
commander
sticklesfor
the
sake
of
his
secret
gold
mineyet
now
he
was
in
a
position
to
give
full
vent
to
his
feelings
for
he
and
his
partners
when
fullyassured
of
the
value
of
their
diggings
had
obtained
from
the
crown
a
licence
to
adventure
in
search
of
minerals
by
payment
of
a
heavy
fine
and
a
yearly
royalty
therefore
they
had
now
no
longer
any
cause
for
secrecy
neither
for
dread
of
the
outlaws
having
so
added
to
their
force
as
to
be
a
match
for
them
and
although
uncle
ben
was
not
the
man
to
keep
his
miners
idle
an
hour
more
than
might
be
helped
he
promised
that
when
we
had
fixed
the
moment
for
an
assault
on
the
valley
a
score
of
them
should
come
to
aid
us
headed
by
simon
carfax
and
armed
with
the
guns
which
they
always
kept
for
the
protection
of
their
gold
now
whether
it
were
uncle
ben
or
whether
it
were
tom
faggus
or
even
my
own
selffor
all
three
of
us
claimed
the
sole
honouris
more
than
i
think
fair
to
settle
without
allowing
them
a
voice
but
at
any
rate
a
clever
thing
was
devised
among
us
and
perhaps
it
would
be
the
fairest
thing
to
say
that
this
bright
stratagem
worthy
of
the
great
duke
himself
was
contributed
little
by
little
among
the
entire
three
of
us
all
having
pipes
and
schnappsandwater
in
the
chimneycorner
however
the
world
which
always
judges
according
to
reputation
vowed
that
so
fine
a
stroke
of
war
could
only
come
from
a
highwayman
and
so
tom
faggus
got
all
the
honour
at
less
perhaps
than
a
third
of
the
cost
not
to
attempt
to
rob
him
of
itfor
robbers
more
than
any
other
contend
for
rights
of
propertylet
me
try
to
describe
this
grand
artifice
it
was
known
that
the
doones
were
fond
of
money
as
well
as
strong
drink
and
other
things
and
more
especially
fond
of
gold
when
they
could
get
it
pure
and
fine
therefore
it
was
agreed
that
in
this
way
we
should
tempt
them
for
we
knew
that
they
looked
with
ridicule
upon
our
rustic
preparations
after
repulsing
kings
troopers
and
the
militia
of
two
counties
was
it
likely
that
they
should
yield
their
fortress
to
a
set
of
ploughboys
we
for
our
part
felt
of
course
the
power
of
this
reasoning
and
that
where
regular
troops
had
failed
halfarmed
countrymen
must
fail
except
by
superior
judgment
and
harmony
of
action
though
perhaps
the
militia
would
have
sufficed
if
they
had
only
fought
against
the
foe
instead
of
against
each
other
from
these
things
we
took
warning
having
failed
through
overconfidence
was
it
not
possible
now
to
make
the
enemy
fail
through
the
selfsame
cause
hence
what
we
devised
was
this
to
delude
from
home
a
part
of
the
robbers
and
fall
by
surprise
on
the
other
part
we
caused
it
to
be
spread
abroad
that
a
large
heap
of
gold
was
now
collected
at
the
mine
of
the
wizards
slough
and
when
this
rumour
must
have
reached
them
through
women
who
came
to
and
fro
as
some
entirely
faithful
to
them
were
allowed
to
do
we
sent
captain
simon
carfax
the
father
of
little
gwenny
to
demand
an
interview
with
the
counsellor
by
night
and
as
it
were
secretly
then
he
was
to
set
forth
a
list
of
imaginary
grievances
against
the
owners
of
the
mine
and
to
offer
partly
through
resentment
partly
through
the
hope
of
gain
to
betray
into
their
hands
upon
the
friday
night
by
far
the
greatest
weight
of
gold
as
yet
sent
up
for
refining
he
was
to
have
one
quarter
part
and
they
to
take
the
residue
but
inasmuch
as
the
convoy
across
the
moors
under
his
command
would
be
strong
and
strongly
armed
the
doones
must
be
sure
to
send
not
less
than
a
score
of
men
if
possible
he
himself
at
a
place
agreed
upon
and
fit
for
an
ambuscade
would
call
a
halt
and
contrive
in
the
darkness
to
pour
a
little
water
into
the
priming
of
his
companys
guns
it
cost
us
some
trouble
and
a
great
deal
of
money
to
bring
the
sturdy
cornishman
into
this
deceitful
part
and
perhaps
he
never
would
have
consented
but
for
his
obligation
to
me
and
the
wrongs
as
he
said
of
his
daughter
however
as
he
was
the
man
for
the
task
both
from
his
coolness
and
courage
and
being
known
to
have
charge
of
the
mine
i
pressed
him
until
he
undertook
to
tell
all
the
lies
we
required
and
right
well
he
did
it
too
having
once
made
up
his
mind
to
it
and
perceiving
that
his
own
interests
called
for
the
total
destruction
of
the
robbers
chapter

a
long
account
settled
having
resolved
on
a
nightassault
as
our
undisciplined
men
threefourths
of
whom
had
never
been
shot
at
could
not
fairly
be
expected
to
march
up
to
visible
musketmouths
we
cared
not
much
about
drilling
our
forces
only
to
teach
them
to
hold
a
musket
so
far
as
we
could
supply
that
weapon
to
those
with
the
cleverest
eyes
and
to
give
them
familiarity
with
the
noise
it
made
in
exploding
and
we
fixed
upon
friday
night
for
our
venture
because
the
moon
would
be
at
the
full
and
our
powder
was
coming
from
dulverton
on
the
friday
afternoon
uncle
reuben
did
not
mean
to
expose
himself
to
shooting
his
time
of
life
for
risk
of
life
being
now
well
over
and
the
residue
too
valuable
but
his
counsels
and
his
influence
and
above
all
his
warehousemen
well
practised
in
beating
carpets
were
of
true
service
to
us
his
miners
also
did
great
wonders
having
a
grudge
against
the
doones
as
indeed
who
had
not
for
thirty
miles
round
their
valley
it
was
settled
that
the
yeomen
having
good
horses
under
them
should
give
account
with
the
miners
help
of
as
many
doones
as
might
be
despatched
to
plunder
the
pretended
gold
and
as
soon
as
we
knew
that
this
party
of
robbers
be
it
more
or
less
was
out
of
hearing
from
the
valley
we
were
to
fall
to
ostensibly
at
the
doonegate
which
was
impregnable
now
but
in
reality
upon
their
rear
by
means
of
my
old
waterslide
for
i
had
chosen
twenty
young
fellows
partly
miners
and
partly
warehousemen
and
sheep
farmers
and
some
of
other
vocations
but
all
to
be
relied
upon
for
spirit
and
power
of
climbing
and
with
proper
tools
to
aid
us
and
myself
to
lead
the
way
i
felt
no
doubt
whatever
but
that
we
could
all
attain
the
crest
where
first
i
had
met
with
lorna
upon
the
whole
i
rejoiced
that
lorna
was
not
present
now
it
must
have
been
irksome
to
her
feelings
to
have
all
her
kindred
and
old
associates
much
as
she
kept
aloof
from
them
put
to
death
without
ceremony
or
else
putting
all
of
us
to
death
for
all
of
us
were
resolved
this
time
to
have
no
more
shillyshallying
but
to
go
through
with
a
nasty
business
in
the
style
of
honest
englishmen
when
the
question
comes
to
your
life
or
mine
there
was
hardly
a
man
among
us
who
had
not
suffered
bitterly
from
the
miscreants
now
before
us
one
had
lost
his
wife
perhaps
another
had
lost
a
daughteraccording
to
their
ages
another
had
lost
his
favourite
cow
in
a
word
there
was
scarcely
any
one
who
had
not
to
complain
of
a
hayrick
and
what
surprised
me
then
not
now
was
that
the
men
least
injured
made
the
greatest
push
concerning
it
but
be
the
wrong
too
great
to
speak
of
or
too
small
to
swear
about
from
poor
kit
badcock
to
rich
master
huckaback
there
was
not
one
but
went
heart
and
soul
for
stamping
out
these
firebrands
the
moon
was
lifting
well
above
the
shoulder
of
the
uplands
when
we
the
chosen
band
set
forth
having
the
short
cut
along
the
valleys
to
foot
of
the
bagworthy
water
and
therefore
having
allowed
the
rest
an
hour
to
fetch
round
the
moors
and
hills
we
were
not
to
begin
our
climb
until
we
heard
a
musket
fired
from
the
heights
on
the
lefthand
side
where
john
fry
himself
was
stationed
upon
his
own
and
his
wifes
request
so
as
to
keep
out
of
action
and
that
was
the
place
where
i
had
been
used
to
sit
and
to
watch
for
lorna
and
john
fry
was
to
fire
his
gun
with
a
ball
of
wool
inside
it
so
soon
as
he
heard
the
hurlyburly
at
the
doonegate
beginning
which
we
by
reason
of
waterfall
could
not
hear
down
in
the
meadows
there
we
waited
a
very
long
time
with
the
moon
marching
up
heaven
steadfastly
and
the
white
fog
trembling
in
chords
and
columns
like
a
silver
harp
of
the
meadows
and
then
the
moon
drew
up
the
fogs
and
scarfed
herself
in
white
with
them
and
so
being
proud
gleamed
upon
the
water
like
a
bride
at
her
lookingglass
and
yet
there
was
no
sound
of
either
john
fry
or
his
blunderbuss
i
began
to
think
that
the
worthy
john
being
out
of
all
danger
and
having
brought
a
counterpane
according
to
his
wifes
directions
because
one
of
the
children
had
a
cold
must
veritably
have
gone
to
sleep
leaving
other
people
to
kill
or
be
killed
as
might
be
the
will
of
god
so
that
he
were
comfortable
but
herein
i
did
wrong
to
john
and
am
ready
to
acknowledge
it
for
suddenly
the
most
awful
noise
that
anything
short
of
thunder
could
make
came
down
among
the
rocks
and
went
and
hung
upon
the
corners
the
signal
my
lads
i
cried
leaping
up
and
rubbing
my
eyes
for
even
now
while
condemning
john
unjustly
i
was
giving
him
right
to
be
hard
upon
me
now
hold
on
by
the
rope
and
lay
your
quarterstaffs
across
my
lads
and
keep
your
guns
pointing
to
heaven
lest
haply
we
shoot
one
another
us
shant
never
shutt
one
anoother
wi
our
goons
at
that
mark
i
reckon
said
an
oldish
chap
but
as
tough
as
leather
and
esteemed
a
wit
for
his
dryness
you
come
next
to
me
old
ike
you
be
enough
to
dry
up
the
waters
now
remember
all
lean
well
forward
if
any
man
throws
his
weight
back
down
he
goes
and
perhaps
he
may
never
get
up
again
and
most
likely
he
will
shoot
himself
i
was
still
more
afraid
of
their
shooting
me
for
my
chief
alarm
in
this
steep
ascent
was
neither
of
the
water
nor
of
the
rocks
but
of
the
loaded
guns
we
bore
if
any
man
slipped
off
might
go
his
gun
and
however
good
his
meaning
i
being
first
was
most
likely
to
take
far
more
than
i
fain
would
apprehend
for
this
cause
i
had
debated
with
uncle
ben
and
with
cousin
tom
as
to
the
expediency
of
our
climbing
with
guns
unloaded
but
they
not
being
in
the
way
themselves
assured
me
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
except
through
uncommon
clumsiness
and
that
as
for
charging
our
guns
at
the
top
even
veteran
troops
could
scarcely
be
trusted
to
perform
it
properly
in
the
hurry
and
the
darkness
and
the
noise
of
fighting
before
them
however
thank
god
though
a
gun
went
off
no
one
was
any
the
worse
for
it
neither
did
the
doones
notice
it
in
the
thick
of
the
firing
in
front
of
them
for
the
orders
to
those
of
the
sham
attack
conducted
by
tom
faggus
were
to
make
the
greatest
possible
noise
without
exposure
of
themselves
until
we
in
the
rear
had
fallen
to
which
john
fry
was
again
to
give
the
signal
of
therefore
we
of
the
chosen
band
stole
up
the
meadow
quietly
keeping
in
the
blots
of
shade
and
hollow
of
the
watercourse
and
the
earliest
notice
the
counsellor
had
or
any
one
else
of
our
presence
was
the
blazing
of
the
logwood
house
where
lived
that
villain
carver
it
was
my
especial
privilege
to
set
this
house
on
fire
upon
which
i
had
insisted
exclusively
and
conclusively
no
other
hand
but
mine
should
lay
a
brand
or
strike
steel
on
flint
for
it
i
had
made
all
preparations
carefully
for
a
goodly
blaze
and
i
must
confess
that
i
rubbed
my
hands
with
a
strong
delight
and
comfort
when
i
saw
the
home
of
that
man
who
had
fired
so
many
houses
having
its
turn
of
smoke
and
blaze
and
of
crackling
fury
we
took
good
care
however
to
burn
no
innocent
women
or
children
in
that
most
righteous
destruction
for
we
brought
them
all
out
beforehand
some
were
glad
and
some
were
sorry
according
to
their
dispositions
for
carver
had
ten
or
a
dozen
wives
and
perhaps
that
had
something
to
do
with
his
taking
the
loss
of
lorna
so
easily
one
child
i
noticed
as
i
saved
him
a
fair
and
handsome
little
fellow
whom
if
carver
doone
could
love
anything
on
earth
beside
his
wretched
self
he
did
love
the
boy
climbed
on
my
back
and
rode
and
much
as
i
hated
his
father
it
was
not
in
my
heart
to
say
or
do
a
thing
to
vex
him
leaving
these
poor
injured
people
to
behold
their
burning
home
we
drew
aside
by
my
directions
into
the
covert
beneath
the
cliff
but
not
before
we
had
laid
our
brands
to
three
other
houses
after
calling
the
women
forth
and
bidding
them
go
for
their
husbands
and
to
come
and
fight
a
hundred
of
us
in
the
smoke
and
rush
and
fire
they
believed
that
we
were
a
hundred
and
away
they
ran
in
consternation
to
the
battle
at
the
doonegate
all
doonetown
is
on
fire
on
fire
we
heard
them
shrieking
as
they
went
a
hundred
soldiers
are
burning
it
with
a
dreadful
great
man
at
the
head
of
them
presently
just
as
i
expected
back
came
the
warriors
of
the
doones
leaving
but
two
or
three
at
the
gate
and
burning
with
wrath
to
crush
under
foot
the
presumptuous
clowns
in
their
valley
just
then
the
waxing
fire
leaped
above
the
red
crest
of
the
cliffs
and
danced
on
the
pillars
of
the
forest
and
lapped
like
a
tide
on
the
stones
of
the
slope
all
the
valley
flowed
with
light
and
the
limpid
waters
reddened
and
the
fair
young
women
shone
and
the
naked
children
glistened
but
the
finest
sight
of
all
was
to
see
those
haughty
men
striding
down
the
causeway
darkly
reckless
of
their
end
but
resolute
to
have
two
lives
for
every
one
a
finer
dozen
of
young
men
could
not
have
been
found
in
the
world
perhaps
nor
a
braver
nor
a
viler
one
seeing
how
few
there
were
of
them
i
was
very
loath
to
fire
although
i
covered
the
leader
who
appeared
to
be
dashing
charley
for
they
were
at
easy
distance
now
brightly
shone
by
the
firelight
yet
ignorant
where
to
look
for
us
i
thought
that
we
might
take
them
prisonersthough
what
good
that
could
be
god
knows
as
they
must
have
been
hanged
thereafteranyhow
i
was
loath
to
shoot
or
to
give
the
word
to
my
followers
but
my
followers
waited
for
no
word
they
saw
a
fair
shot
at
the
men
they
abhorred
the
men
who
had
robbed
them
of
home
or
of
love
and
the
chance
was
too
much
for
their
charity
at
a
signal
from
old
ikey
who
levelled
his
own
gun
first
a
dozen
muskets
were
discharged
and
half
of
the
doones
dropped
lifeless
like
so
many
logs
of
firewood
or
choppingblocks
rolled
over
although
i
had
seen
a
great
battle
before
and
a
hundred
times
the
carnage
this
appeared
to
me
to
be
horrible
and
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
fall
upon
our
men
for
behaving
so
but
one
instant
showed
me
that
they
were
right
for
while
the
valley
was
filled
with
howling
and
with
shrieks
of
women
and
the
beams
of
the
blazing
houses
fell
and
hissed
in
the
bubbling
river
all
the
rest
of
the
doones
leaped
at
us
like
so
many
demons
they
fired
wildly
not
seeing
us
well
among
the
hazel
bushes
and
then
they
clubbed
their
muskets
or
drew
their
swords
as
might
be
and
furiously
drove
at
us
for
a
moment
although
we
were
twice
their
number
we
fell
back
before
their
valorous
fame
and
the
power
of
their
onset
for
my
part
admiring
their
courage
greatly
and
counting
it
slur
upon
manliness
that
two
should
be
down
upon
one
so
i
withheld
my
hand
awhile
for
i
cared
to
meet
none
but
carver
and
he
was
not
among
them
the
whirl
and
hurry
of
this
fight
and
the
hard
blows
raining
downfor
now
all
guns
were
emptytook
away
my
power
of
seeing
or
reasoning
upon
anything
yet
one
thing
i
saw
which
dwelled
long
with
me
and
that
was
christopher
badcock
spending
his
life
to
get
charleys
how
he
had
found
out
none
may
tell
both
being
dead
so
long
ago
but
at
any
rate
he
had
found
out
that
charley
was
the
man
who
had
robbed
him
of
his
wife
and
honour
it
was
carver
doone
who
took
her
away
but
charleworth
doone
was
beside
him
and
according
to
cast
of
dice
she
fell
to
charleys
share
all
this
kit
badcock
who
was
mad
according
to
our
measures
had
discovered
and
treasured
up
and
now
was
his
revengetime
he
had
come
into
the
conflict
without
a
weapon
of
any
kind
only
begging
me
to
let
him
be
in
the
very
thick
of
it
for
him
he
said
life
was
no
matter
after
the
loss
of
his
wife
and
child
but
death
was
matter
to
him
and
he
meant
to
make
the
most
of
it
such
a
face
i
never
saw
and
never
hope
to
see
again
as
when
poor
kit
badcock
spied
charley
coming
towards
us
we
had
thought
this
man
a
patient
fool
a
philosopher
of
a
little
sort
or
one
who
could
feel
nothing
and
his
quiet
manner
of
going
about
and
the
gentleness
of
his
answers
when
some
brutes
asked
him
where
his
wife
was
and
whether
his
baby
had
been
welltrussed
these
had
misled
us
to
think
that
the
man
would
turn
the
mild
cheek
to
everything
but
i
in
the
loneliness
of
our
barn
had
listened
and
had
wept
with
him
therefore
was
i
not
surprised
so
much
as
all
the
rest
of
us
when
in
the
foremost
of
red
light
kit
went
up
to
charleworth
doone
as
if
to
some
inheritance
and
took
his
seisin
of
right
upon
him
being
himself
a
powerful
man
and
begged
a
word
aside
with
him
what
they
said
aside
i
know
not
all
i
know
is
that
without
weapon
each
man
killed
the
other
and
margery
badcock
came
and
wept
and
hung
upon
her
poor
husband
and
died
that
summer
of
heartdisease
now
for
these
and
other
things
whereof
i
could
tell
a
thousand
was
the
reckoning
come
that
night
and
not
a
line
we
missed
of
it
soon
as
our
bad
blood
was
up
i
like
not
to
tell
of
slaughter
though
it
might
be
of
wolves
and
tigers
and
that
was
a
night
of
fire
and
slaughter
and
of
very
longharboured
revenge
enough
that
ere
the
daylight
broke
upon
that
wan
march
morning
the
only
doones
still
left
alive
were
the
counsellor
and
carver
and
of
all
the
dwellings
of
the
doones
inhabited
with
luxury
and
luscious
taste
and
licentiousness
not
even
one
was
left
but
all
made
potash
in
the
river
this
may
seem
a
violent
and
unholy
revenge
upon
them
and
i
who
led
the
heart
of
it
have
in
these
my
latter
years
doubted
how
i
shall
be
judged
not
of
menfor

errors

the

from
that
great
confusionfor
nothing
can
be
broken
up
whether
lawful
or
unlawful
without
a
vast
amount
of
dust
and
many
people
grumbling
and
mourning
for
the
good
old
times
when
all
the
world
was
happiness
and
every
man
a
gentleman
and
the
sun
himself
far
brighter
than
since
the
brassy
idol
upon
which
he
shone
was
brokenfrom
all
this
loss
of
ancient
landmarks
as
unrobbed
men
began
to
call
our
clearance
of
those
murderers
we
returned
on
the
following
day
almost
as
full
of
anxiety
as
we
were
of
triumph
in
the
first
place
what
could
we
possibly
do
with
all
these
women
and
children
thrown
on
our
hands
as
one
might
say
with
none
to
protect
and
care
for
them
again
how
should
we
answer
to
the
justices
of
the
peace
or
perhaps
even
to
lord
jeffreys
for
having
without
even
a
warrant
taken
the
law
into
our
own
hands
and
abated
our
nuisance
so
forcibly
and
then
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
spoil
which
was
of
great
value
though
the
diamond
necklace
came
not
to
public
light
for
we
saw
a
mighty
host
of
claimants
already
leaping
up
for
booty
every
man
who
had
ever
been
robbed
expected
usury
on
his
loss
the
lords
of
the
manors
demanded
the
whole
and
so
did
the
kings
commissioner
of
revenue
at
porlock
and
so
did
the
men
who
had
fought
our
battle
while
even
the
parsons
both
bowden
and
powell
and
another
who
had
no
parish
in
it
threatened
us
with
the
just
wrath
of
the
church
unless
each
had
tithes
of
the
whole
of
it
now
this
was
not
as
it
ought
to
be
and
it
seemed
as
if
by
burning
the
nest
of
robbers
we
had
but
hatched
their
eggs
until
being
made
sole
guardian
of
the
captured
treasure
by
reason
of
my
known
honesty
i
hit
upon
a
plan
which
gave
very
little
satisfaction
yet
carried
this
advantage
that
the
grumblers
argued
against
one
another
and
for
the
most
part
came
to
blows
which
renewed
their
goodwill
to
me
as
being
abused
by
the
adversary
and
my
plan
was
no
more
than
thisnot
to
pay
a
farthing
to
lord
of
manor
parson
or
even
kings
commissioner
but
after
making
good
some
of
the
recent
and
proven
losseswhere
the
men
could
not
afford
to
loseto
pay
the
residue
which
might
be
worth
some
fifty
thousand
pounds
into
the
exchequer
at
westminster
and
then
let
all
the
claimants
file
what
wills
they
pleased
in
chancery
now
this
was
a
very
noble
device
for
the
mere
name
of
chancery
and
the
high
repute
of
the
fees
therein
and
low
repute
of
the
lawyers
and
the
comfortable
knowledge
that
the
woolsack
itself
is
the
golden
fleece
absorbing
gold
for
ever
if
the
standard
be
but
pure
consideration
of
these
things
staved
off
at
once
the
lords
of
the
manors
and
all
the
little
farmers
and
even
those
whom
most
i
feared
videlicet
the
parsons
and
the
kings
commissioner
was
compelled
to
profess
himself
contented
although
of
all
he
was
most
aggrieved
for
his
pickings
would
have
been
goodly
moreover
by
this
plan
i
madealthough
i
never
thought
of
thata
mighty
friend
worth
all
the
enemies
whom
the
loss
of
money
moved
the
first
man
now
in
the
kingdom
by
virtue
perhaps
of
energy
rather
than
of
excellence
was
the
great
lord
jeffreys
appointed
the
head
of
the
equity
as
well
as
the
law
of
the
realm
for
his
kindness
in
hanging
five
hundred
people
without
the
mere
brief
of
trial
nine
out
of
ten
of
these
people
were
innocent
it
was
true
but
that
proved
the
merit
of
the
lord
chief
justice
so
much
the
greater
for
hanging
them
as
showing
what
might
be
expected
of
him
when
he
truly
got
hold
of
a
guilty
man
now
the
king
had
seen
the
force
of
this
argument
and
not
being
without
gratitude
for
a
highseasoned
dish
of
cruelty
had
promoted
the
only
man
in
england
combining
the
gifts
of
both
butcher
and
cook
nevertheless
i
do
beg
you
all
to
believe
of
meand
i
think
that
after
following
me
so
long
you
must
believe
itthat
i
did
not
even
know
at
the
time
of
lord
jeffreyss
high
promotion
not
that
my
knowledge
of
this
would
have
led
me
to
act
otherwise
in
the
matter
for
my
object
was
to
pay
into
an
office
and
not
to
any
official
neither
if
i
had
known
the
fact
could
i
have
seen
its
bearing
upon
the
receipt
of
my
money
for
the
kings
exchequer
is
meseemeth
of
the
common
law
while
chancery
is
of
equity
and
well
named
for
its
many
chances
but
the
true
result
of
the
thing
was
thislord
jeffreys
being
now
head
of
the
law
and
almost
head
of
the
kingdom
got
possession
of
that
money
and
was
kindly
pleased
with
it
and
this
met
our
second
difficulty
for
the
law
having
won
and
laughed
over
the
spoil
must
have
injured
its
own
title
by
impugning
our
legality
next
with
regard
to
the
women
and
children
we
were
long
in
a
state
of
perplexity
we
did
our
very
best
at
the
farm
and
so
did
many
others
to
provide
for
them
until
they
should
manage
about
their
own
subsistence
and
after
a
while
this
trouble
went
as
nearly
all
troubles
go
with
time
some
of
the
women
were
taken
back
by
their
parents
or
their
husbands
or
it
may
be
their
sweethearts
and
those
who
failed
of
this
went
forth
some
upon
their
own
account
to
the
new
world
plantations
where
the
fairer
sex
is
valuable
and
some
to
english
cities
and
the
plainer
ones
to
field
work
and
most
of
the
children
went
with
their
mothers

of
his
father
the
savage
and
brutal
carver
this
man
was
left
to
roam
the
country
homeless
foodless
and
desperate
with
his
giant
strength
and
great
skill
in
arms
and
the
whole
world
to
be
revenged
upon
for
his
escape
the
miners
as
i
shall
show
were
answerable
but
of
the
counsellors
safe
departure
the
burden
lay
on
myself
alone
and
inasmuch
as
there
are
people
who
consider
themselves
illused
unless
one
tells
them
everything
straitened
though
i
am
for
space
i
will
glance
at
this
transaction
after
the
desperate
charge
of
young
doones
had
been
met
by
us
and
broken
and
just
as
poor
kit
badcock
died
in
the
arms
of
the
dead
charley
i
happened
to
descry
a
patch
of
white
on
the
grass
of
the
meadow
like
the
head
of
a
sheep
after
washingday
observing
with
some
curiosity
how
carefully
this
white
thing
moved
along
the
bars
of
darkness
betwixt
the
panels
of
firelight
i
ran
up
to
intercept
it
before
it
reached
the
little
postern
which
we
used
to
call
gwennys
door
perceiving
me
the
white
thing
stopped
and
was
for
making
back
again
but
i
ran
up
at
full
speed
and
lo
it
was
the
flowing
silvery
hair
of
that
sage
the
counsellor
who
was
scuttling
away
upon
all
fours
but
now
rose
and
confronted
me
john
he
said
sir
john
you
will
not
play
falsely
with
your
ancient
friend
among
these
violent
fellows
i
look
to
you
to
protect
me
john
honoured
sir
you
are
right
i
replied
but
surely
that
posture
was
unworthy
of
yourself
and
your
many
resources
it
is
my
intention
to
let
you
go
free
i
knew
it
i
could
have
sworn
to
it
you
are
a
noble
fellow
john
i
said
so
from
the
very
first
you
are
a
noble
fellow
and
an
ornament
to
any
rank
but
upon
two
conditions
i
added
gently
taking
him
by
the
arm
for
instead
of
displaying
any
desire
to
commune
with
my
nobility
he
was
edging
away
toward
the
postern
the
first
is
that
you
tell
me
truly
for
now
it
can
matter
to
none
of
you
who
it
was
that
slew
my
father
i
will
tell
you
truly
and
frankly
john
however
painful
to
me
to
confess
it
it
was
my
son
carver
i
thought
as
much
or
i
felt
as
much
all
along
i
answered
but
the
fault
was
none
of
yours
sir
for
you
were
not
even
present
if
i
had
been
there
it
would
not
have
happened
i
am
always
opposed
to
violence
therefore
let
me
haste
away
this
scene
is
against
my
nature
you
shall
go
directly
sir
counsellor
after
meeting
my
other
condition
which
is
that
you
place
in
my
hands
lady
lornas
diamond
necklace
ah
how
often
i
have
wished
said
the
old
man
with
a
heavy
sigh
that
it
might
yet
be
in
my
power
to
ease
my
mind
in
that
respect
and
to
do
a
thoroughly
good
deed
by
lawful
restitution
then
try
to
have
it
in
your
power
sir
surely
with
my
encouragement
you
might
summon
resolution
alas
john
the
resolution
has
been
ready
long
ago
but
the
thing
is
not
in
my
possession
carver
my
son
who
slew
your
father
upon
him
you
will
find
the
necklace
what
are
jewels
to
me
young
man
at
my
time
of
life
baubles
and
trashi
detest
them
from
the
sins
they
have
led
me
to
answer
for
when
you
come
to
my
age
good
sir
john
you
will
scorn
all
jewels
and
care
only
for
a
pure
and
bright
conscience
ah
ah
let
me
go
i
have
made
my
peace
with
god
he
looked
so
hoary
and
so
silvery
and
serene
in
the
moonlight
that
verily
i
must
have
believed
him
if
he
had
not
drawn
in
his
breast
but
i
happened
to
have
noticed
that
when
an
honest
man
gives
vent
to
noble
and
great
sentiments
he
spreads
his
breast
and
throws
it
out
as
if
his
heart
were
swelling
whereas
i
had
seen
this
old
gentleman
draw
in
his
breast
more
than
once
as
if
it
happened
to
contain
better
goods
than
sentiment
will
you
applaud
me
kind
sir
i
said
keeping
him
very
tight
all
the
while
if
i
place
it
in
your
power
to
ratify
your
peace
with
god
the
pledge
is
upon
your
heart
no
doubt
for
there
it
lies
at
this
moment
with
these
words
and
some
apology
for
having
recourse
to
strong
measures
i
thrust
my
hand
inside
his
waistcoat
and
drew
forth
lornas
necklace
purely
sparkling
in
the
moonlight
like
the
dancing
of
new
stars
the
old
man
made
a
stab
at
me
with
a
knife
which
i
had
not
espied
but
the
vicious
onset
failed
and
then
he
knelt
and
clasped
his
hands
oh
for
gods
sake
john
my
son
rob
me
not
in
that
manner
they
belong
to
me
and
i
love
them
so
i
would
give
almost
my
life
for
them
there
is
one
jewel
i
can
look
at
for
hours
and
see
all
the
lights
of
heaven
in
it
which
i
never
shall
see
elsewhere
all
my
wretched
wicked
lifeoh
john
i
am
a
sad
hypocritebut
give
me
back
my
jewels
or
else
kill
me
here
i
am
a
babe
in
your
hands
but
i
must
have
back
my
jewels
as
his
beautiful
white
hair
fell
away
from
his
noble
forehead
like
a
silver
wreath
of
glory
and
his
powerful
face
for
once
was
moved
with
real
emotion
i
was
so
amazed
and
overcome
by
the
grand
contradictions
of
nature
that
verily
i
was
on
the
point
of
giving
him
back
the
necklace
but
honesty
which
is
said
to
be
the
first
instinct
of
all
the
ridds
though
i
myself
never
found
it
so
happened
here
to
occur
to
me
and
so
i
said
without
more
haste
than
might
be
expected
sir
counsellor
i
cannot
give
you
what
does
not
belong
to
me
but
if
you
will
show
me
that
particular
diamond
which
is
heaven
to
you
i
will
take
upon
myself
the
risk
and
the
folly
of
cutting
it
out
for
you
and
with
that
you
must
go
contented
and
i
beseech
you
not
to
starve
with
that
jewel
upon
your
lips
seeing
no
hope
of
better
terms
he
showed
me
his
pet
love
of
a
jewel
and
i
thought
of
what
lorna
was
to
me
as
i
cut
it
out
with
the
hinge
of
my
knife
severing
the
snakes
of
gold
and
placed
it
in
his
careful
hand
another
moment
and
he
was
gone
and
away
through
gwennys
postern
and
god
knows
what
became
of
him
now
as
to
carver
the
thing
was
thisso
far
as
i
could
ascertain
from
the
valiant
miners
no
two
of
whom
told
the
same
story
any
more
than
one
of
them
told
it
twice
the
band
of
doones
which
sallied
forth
for
the
robbery
of
the
pretended
convoy
was
met
by
simon
carfax
according
to
arrangement
at
the
ruined
house
called
the
warren
in
that
part
of
bagworthy
forest
where
the
river
exe
as
yet
a
very
small
stream
runs
through
it
the
warren
as
all
our
people
know
had
belonged
to
a
fine
old
gentleman
whom
every
one
called
the
squire
who
had
retreated
from
active
life
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
days
in
fishing
and
shooting
and
helping
his
neighbours
for
he
was
a
man
of
some
substance
and
no
poor
man
ever
left
the
warren
without
a
bag
of
good
victuals
and
a
few
shillings
put
in
his
pocket
however
this
poor
squire
never
made
a
greater
mistake
than
in
hoping
to
end
his
life
peacefully
upon
the
banks
of
a
troutstream
and
in
the
green
forest
of
bagworthy
for
as
he
came
home
from
the
brook
at
dusk
with
his
flyrod
over
his
shoulder
the
doones
fell
upon
him
and
murdered
him
and
then
sacked
his
house
and
burned
it
now
this
had
made
honest
people
timid
about
going
past
the
warren
at
night
for
of
course
it
was
said
that
the
old
squire
walked
upon
certain
nights
of
the
moon
in
and
out
of
the
trunks
of
trees
on
the
green
path
from
the
river
on
his
shoulder
he
bore
a
fishingrod
and
his
book
of
troutflies
in
one
hand
and
on
his
back
a
wickercreel
and
now
and
then
he
would
burst
out
laughing
to
think
of
his
coming
so
near
the
doones
and
now
that
one
turns
to
consider
it
this
seems
a
strangely
righteous
thing
that
the
scene
of
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
even
by
doones
committed
should
after
twenty
years
become
the
scene
of
vengeance
falling
like
hail
from
heaven
upon
them
for
although
the
warren
lies
well
away
to
the
westward
of
the
mine
and
the
gold
under
escort
to
bristowe
or
london
would
have
gone
in
the
other
direction
captain
carfax
finding
this
place
best
suited
for
working
of
his
design
had
persuaded
the
doones
that
for
reasons
of
government
the
ore
must
go
first
to
barnstaple
for
inspection
or
something
of
that
sort
and
as
every
one
knows
that
our
government
sends
all
things
westward
when
eastward
bound
this
had
won
the
more
faith
for
simon
as
being
according
to
nature
now
simon
having
met
these
flowers
of
the
flock
of
villainy
where
the
rising
moonlight
flowed
through
the
weirwork
of
the
wood
begged
them
to
dismount
and
led
them
with
an
air
of
mystery
into
the
squires
ruined
hall
black
with
fire
and
green
with
weeds
captain
i
have
found
a
thing
he
said
to
carver
doone
himself
which
may
help
to
pass
the
hour
ere
the
lump
of
gold
comes
by
the
smugglers
are
a
noble
race
but
a
miners
eyes
are
a
match
for
them
there
lies
a
puncheon
of
rare
spirit
with
the
dutchmans
brand
upon
it
hidden
behind
the
broken
hearth
set
a
man
to
watch
outside
and
let
us
see
what
this
be
like
with
one
accord
they
agreed
to
this
and
carver
pledged
master
carfax
and
all
the
doones
grew
merry
but
simon
being
bound
as
he
said
to
see
to
their
strict
sobriety
drew
a
bucket
of
water
from
the
well
into
which
they
had
thrown
the
dead
owner
and
begged
them
to
mingle
it
with
their
drink
which
some
of
them
did
and
some
refused
but
the
water
from
that
well
was
poured
while
they
were
carousing
into
the
primingpan
of
every
gun
of
theirs
even
as
simon
had
promised
to
do
with
the
guns
of
the
men
they
were
come
to
kill
then
just
as
the
giant
carver
arose
with
a
glass
of
pure
hollands
in
his
hand
and
by
the
light
of
the
torch
they
had
struck
proposed
the
good
health
of
the
squires
ghostin
the
broken
doorway
stood
a
press
of
men
with
pointed
muskets
covering
every
drunken
doone
how
it
fared
upon
that
i
know
not
having
none
to
tell
me
for
each
man
wrought
neither
thought
of
telling
nor
whether
he
might
be
alive
to
tell
the
doones
rushed
to
their
guns
at
once
and
pointed
them
and
pulled
at
them
but
the
squires
well
had
drowned
their
fire
and
then
they
knew
that
they
were
betrayed
but
resolved
to
fight
like
men
for
it
upon
fighting
i
can
never
dwell
it
breeds
such
savage
delight
in
me
of
which
i
would
fain
have
less
enough
that
all
the
doones
fought
bravely
and
like
men
though
bad
ones
died
in
the
hall
of
the
man
they
had
murdered
and
with
them
died
poor
young
de
whichehalse
who
in
spite
of
his
good
fathers
prayers
had
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
robbers
carver
doone
alone
escaped
partly
through
his
fearful
strength
and
his
yet
more
fearful
face
but
mainly
perhaps
through
his
perfect
coolness
and
his
mode
of
taking
things
i
am
happy
to
say
that
no
more
than
eight
of
the
gallant
miners
were
killed
in
that
combat
or
died
of
their
wounds
afterwards
and
adding
to
these
the
eight
we
had
lost
in
our
assault
on
the
valley
and
two
of
them
excellent
warehousemen
it
cost
no
more
than
sixteen
lives
to
be
rid
of
nearly
forty
doones
each
of
whom
would
most
likely
have
killed
three
men
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
therefore
as
i
said
at
the
time
a
great
work
was
done
very
reasonably
here
were
nigh
upon
forty
doones
destroyed
in
the
valley
and
up
at
the
warrens
despite
their
extraordinary
strength
and
high
skill
in
gunnery
whereas
of
us
ignorant
rustics
there
were
only
sixteen
to
be
counted
deadthough
others
might
be
lamed
or
soand
of
those
sixteen
only
two
had
left
wives
and
their
wives
did
not
happen
to
care
for
them
yet
for
lorna
s
sake
i
was
vexed
at
the
bold
escape
of
carver
not
that
i
sought
for
carvers
life
any
more
than
i
did
for
the
counsellors
but
that
for
us
it
was
no
light
thing
to
have
a
man
of
such
power
and
resource
and
desperation
left
at
large
and
furious
like
a
famished
wolf
round
the
sheepfold
yet
greatly
as
i
blamed
the
yeomen
who
were
posted
on
their
horses
just
out
of
shot
from
the
doonegate
for
the
very
purpose
of
intercepting
those
who
escaped
the
miners
i
could
not
get
them
to
admit
that
any
blame
attached
to
them
but
lo
he
had
dashed
through
the
whole
of
them
with
his
horse
at
full
gallop
and
was
nearly
out
of
shot
before
they
began
to
think
of
shooting
him
then
it
appears
from
what
a
boy
saidfor
boys

to
be
everywherethat
captain
carver
rode
through
the
doonegate
and
so
to
the
head
of
the
valley
there
of
course
he
beheld
all
the
houses
and
his
own
among
the
number
flaming
with
a
handsome
blaze
and
throwing
a
fine
light
around
such
as
he
often
had
revelled
in
when
of
other
peoples
property
but
he
swore
the
deadliest
of
all
oaths
and
seeing
himself
to
be
vanquished
so
far
as
the
luck
of
the
moment
went

great
black
horse
away
and
passed
into

darkness
chapter
lxxiii
how
to
get
out
of
chancery
things
at
this
time
so
befell
me
that
i
cannot
tell
one
half
but
am
like
a
boy
who
has
left
his
lesson
to
the
masters
very
footfall
unready
except
with
false
excuses
and
as
this
makes
no
good
work
so
i
lament
upon
my
lingering
in
the
times
when
i
might
have
got
through
a
good
page
but
went
astray
after
trifles
however
every
man
must
do
according
to
his
intellect
and
looking
at
the
easy
manner
of
my
constitution
i
think
that
most
men
will
regard
me
with
pity
and
goodwill
for
trying
more
than
with
contempt
and
wrath
for
having
tried
unworthily
even
as
in
the
wrestling
ring
whatever
man
did
his
best
and
made
an
honest
conflict
i
always
laid
him
down
with
softness
easing
off
his
dusty
fall
but
the
thing
which
next
betided
me
was
not
a
fall
of
any
sort
but
rather
a
most
glorious
rise
to
the
summit
of
all
fortune
for
in
good
truth
it
was
no
less
than
the
return
of
lornamy
lorna
my
own
darling
in
wonderful
health
and
spirits
and
as
glad
as
a
bird
to
get
back
again
it
would
have
done
any
one
good
for
a
twelvemonth
to
behold
her
face
and
doings
and
her
beaming
eyes
and
smile
not
to
mention
blushes
also
at
my
salutation
when
this
queen
of
every
heart
ran
about
our
rooms
again
she
did
love
this
and
she
must
see
that
and
where
was
our
old
friend
the
cat
all
the
house
was
full
of
brightness
as
if
the
sun
had
come
over
the
hill
and
lorna
were
his
mirror
my
mother
sat
in
an
ancient
chair
and
wiped
her
cheeks
and
looked
at
her
and
even
lizzies
eyes
must
dance
to
the
freshness
and
joy
of
her
beauty
as
for
me
you
might
call
me
mad
for
i
ran
out
and
flung
my
best
hat
on
the
barn
and
kissed
mother
fry
till
she
made
at
me
with
the
sugarnippers
what
a
quantity
of
things
lorna
had
to
tell
us
and
yet
how
often
we
stopped
her
mouthat
least
mother
i
mean
and
lizzieand
she
quite
as
often
would
stop
her
own
running
up
in
her
joy
to
some
one
of
us
and
then
there
arose
the
eating
businesswhich
people
now
call
refreshment
in
these
dandyfied
days
of
our
languagefor
how
was
it
possible
that
our
lorna
could
have
come
all
that
way
and
to
her
own
exmoor
without
being
terribly
hungry
oh
i
do
love
it
all
so
much
said
lorna
now
for
the
fiftieth
time
and
not
meaning
only
the
victuals
the
scent
of
the
gorse
on
the
moors
drove
me
wild
and
the
primroses
under
the
hedges
i
am
sure
i
was
meant
for
a
farmersi
mean
for
a
farmhouse
life
dear
lizziefor
lizzie
was
looking
saucilyjust
as
you
were
meant
for
a
soldiers
bride
and
for
writing
despatches
of
victory
and
now
since
you
will
not
ask
me
dear
mother
in
the
excellence
of
your
manners
and
even
john
has
not
the
impudence
in
spite
of
all
his
coat
of
armsi
must
tell
you
a
thing
which
i
vowed
to
keep
until
tomorrow
morning
but
my
resolution
fails
me
i
am
my
own
mistresswhat
think
you
of
that
mother
i
am
my
own
mistress
then
you
shall
not
be
so
long
cried
i
for
mother
seemed
not
to
understand
her
and
sought
about
for
her
glasses
darling
you
shall
be
mistress
of
me
and
i
will
be
your
master
a
frank
announcement
of
your
intent
and
beyond
doubt
a
true
one
but
surely
unusual
at
this
stage
and
a
little
premature
john
however
what
must
be
must
be
and
with
tears
springing
out
of
smiles
she
fell
on
my
breast
and
cried
a
bit
when
i
came
to
smoke
a
pipe
over
it
after
the
rest
were
gone
to
bed
i
could
hardly
believe
in
my
good
luck
for
here
was
i
without
any
merit
except
of
bodily
power
and
the
absence
of
any
falsehood
which
surely
is
no
commendation
so
placed
that
the
noblest
man
in
england
might
envy
me
and
be
vexed
with
me
for
the
noblest
lady
in
all
the
land
and
the
purest
and
the
sweetesthung
upon
my
heart
as
if
there
was
none
to
equal
it
i
dwelled
upon
this
matter
long
and
very
severely
while
i
smoked
a
new
tobacco
brought
by
my
own
lorna
for
me
and
next
to
herself
most
delicious
and
as
the
smoke
curled
away
i
thought
surely
this
is
too
fine
to
last
for
a
man
who
never
deserved
it
seeing
no
way
out
of
this
i
resolved
to
place
my
faith
in
god
and
so
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
of
it
and
having
no
presence
of
mind
to
pray
for
anything
under
the
circumstances
i
thought
it
best
to
fall
asleep
and
trust
myself
to
the
future
yet
ere
i
fell
asleep
the
roof
above
me
swarmed
with
angels
having
lorna
under
it
in
the
morning
lorna
was
ready
to
tell
her
story
and
we
to
hearken
and
she
wore
a
dress
of
most
simple
stuff
and
yet
perfectly
wonderful
by
means
of
the
shape
and
her
figure
lizzie
was
wild
with
jealousy
as
might
be
expected
though
never
would
annie
have
been
so
but
have
praised
it
and
craved
for
the
pattern
and
mother
not
understanding
it
looked
forth
to
be
taught
about
it
for
it
was
strange
to
note
that
lately
my
dear
mother
had
lost
her
quickness
and
was
never
quite
brisk
unless
the
question
were
about
myself
she
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
grief
begins
to
close
on
people
as
their
power
of
life
declines
we
said
that
she
was
hard
of
hearing
but
my
opinion
was
that
seeing
me
inclined
for
marriage
made
her
think
of
my
father
and
so
perhaps
a
little
too
much
to
dwell
on
the
courting
of
thirty
years
agone
anyhow
she
was
the
very
best
of
mothers
and
would
smile
and
command
herself
and
be
or
try
to
believe
herself
as
happy
as
could
be
in
the
doings
of
the
younger
folk
and
her
own
skill
in
detecting
them
yet
with
the
wisdom
of
age
renouncing
any
opinion
upon
the
matter
since
none
could
see
the
end
of
it
but
lorna
in
her
bright
young
beauty
and
her
knowledge
of
my
heart
was
not
to
be
checked
by
any
thoughts
of
haply
coming
evil
in
the
morning
she
was
up
even
sooner
than
i
was
and
through
all
the
corners
of
the
hens
remembering
every
one
of
them
i
caught
her
and
saluted
her
with
such
warmth
being
now
none
to
look
at
us
that
she
vowed
she
would
never
come
out
again
and
yet
she
came
the
next
morning
these
things
ought
not
to
be
chronicled
yet
i
am
of
such
nature
that
finding
many
parts
of
life
adverse
to
our
wishes
i
must
now
and
then
draw
pleasure
from
the
blessed
portions
and
what
portion
can
be
more
blessed
than
with
youth
and
health
and
strength
to
be
loved
by
a
virtuous
maid
and
to
love
her
with
all
ones
heart
neither
was
my
pride
diminished
when
i
found
what
she
had
done
only
from
her
love
of
me
earl
brandirs
ancient
steward
in
whose
charge
she
had
travelled
with
a
proper
escort
looked
upon
her
as
a
lovely
maniac
and
the
mixture
of
pity
and
admiration
wherewith
he
regarded
her
was
a
strange
thing
to
observe
especially
after
he
had
seen
our
simple
house
and
manners
on
the
other
hand
lorna
considered
him
a
worthy
but
foolish
old
gentleman
to
whom
true
happiness
meant
no
more
than
money
and
high
position
these
two
last
she
had
been
ready
to
abandon
wholly
and
had
in
part
escaped
from
them
as
the
enemies
of
her
happiness
and
she
took
advantage
of
the
times
in
a
truly
clever
manner
for
that
happened
to
be
a
timeas
indeed
all
times
hitherto
so
far
as
my
knowledge
extends
have
somehow
or
other
happened
to
bewhen
everybody
was
only
too
glad
to
take
money
for
doing
anything
and
the
greatest
moneytaker
in
the
kingdom
next
to
the
king
and
queen
of
course
who
had
due
preeminence
and
had
taught
the
maids
of
honour
was
generally
acknowledged
to
be
the
lord
chief
justice
jeffreys
upon
his
return
from
the
bloody
assizes
with
triumph
and
great
glory
after
hanging
every
man
who
was
too
poor
to
help
it
he
pleased
his
gracious
majesty
so
purely
with
the
description
of
their
delightful
agonies
that
the
king
exclaimed
this
man
alone
is
worthy
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
law
accordingly
in
his
hand
was
placed
the
great
seal
of
england
so
it
came
to
pass
that
lornas
destiny
hung
upon
lord
jeffreys
for
at
this
time
earl
brandir
died
being
taken
with
gout
in
the
heart
soon
after
i
left
london
lorna
was
very
sorry
for
him
but
as
he
had
never
been
able
to
hear
one
tone
of
her
sweet
silvery
voice
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
she
wept
without
consolation
she
grieved
for
him
as
we
ought
to
grieve
for
any
good
man
going
and
yet
with
a
comforting
sense
of
the
benefit
which
the
blessed
exchange
must
bring
to
him
now
the
lady
lorna
dugal
appeared
to
lord
chancellor
jeffreys
so
exceeding
wealthy
a
ward
that
the
lock
would
pay
for
turning
therefore
he
came
of
his
own
accord
to
visit
her
and
to
treat
with
her
having
heard
for
the
man
was
as
big
a
gossip
as
never
cared
for
anybody
yet
loved
to
know
all
about
everybody
that
this
wealthy
and
beautiful
maiden
would
not
listen
to
any
young
lord
having
pledged
her
faith
to
the
plain
john
ridd
thereupon
our
lorna
managed
so
to
hold
out
golden
hopes
to
the
lord
high
chancellor
that
he
being
not
more
than
three
parts
drunk
saw
his
way
to
a
heap
of
money
and
there
and
then
for
he
was
not
the
man
to
daily
long
about
anything
upon
surety
of
a
certain
round
sumthe
amount
of
which
i
will
not
mention
because
of
his
kindness
towards
mehe
gave
to
his
fair
ward
permission
under
sign
and
seal
to
marry
that
loyal
knight
john
ridd
upon
condition
only
that
the
kings
consent
should
be
obtained
his
majesty
welldisposed
towards
me
for
my
previous
service
and
regarding
me
as
a
good
catholic
being
moved
moreover
by
the
queen
who
desired
to
please
lorna
consented
without
much
hesitation
upon
the
understanding
that
lorna
when
she
became
of
full
age
and
the
mistress
of
her
property
which
was
still
under
guardianship
should
pay
a
heavy
fine
to
the
crown
and
devote
a
fixed
portion
of
her
estate
to
the
promotion
of
the
holy
catholic
faith
in
a
manner
to
be
dictated
by
the
king
himself
inasmuch
however
as
king
james
was
driven
out
of
his
kingdom
before
this
arrangement
could
take
effect
and
another
king
succeeded
who
desired
not
the
promotion
of
the
catholic
religion
neither
hankered
after
subsidies
whether
french
or
english
that
agreement
was
pronounced
invalid
improper
and
contemptible
however
there
was
no
getting
back
the
money
once
paid
to
lord
chancellor
jeffreys
but
what
thought
we
of
money
at
this
present
moment
or
of
position
or
anything
else
except
indeed
one
another
lorna
told
me
with
the
sweetest
smile
that
if
i
were
minded
to
take
her
at
all
i
must
take
her
without
anything
inasmuch
as
she
meant
upon
coming
of
age
to
make
over
the
residue
of
her
estates
to
the
nextofkin
as
being
unfit
for
a
farmers
wife
and
i
replied
with
the
greatest
warmth
and
a
readiness
to
worship
her
that
this
was
exactly
what
i
longed
for
but
had
never
dared
to
propose
it
but
dear
mother
looked
most
exceeding
grave
and
said
that
to
be
sure
her
opinion
could
not
be
expected
to
count
for
much
but
she
really
hoped
that
in
three
years
time
we
should
both
he
a
little
wiser
and
have
more
regard
for
our
interests
and
perhaps
those
of
others
by
that
time
and
master
snowe
having
daughters
only
and
nobody
coming
to
marry
them
if
anything
happened
to
the
good
old
manand
who
could
tell
in
three
years
time
what
might
happen
to
all
or
any
of
uswhy
perhaps
his
farm
would
be
for
sale
and
perhaps
lady
lornas
estates
in
scotland
would
fetch
enough
money
to
buy
it
and
so
throw
the
two
farms
into
one
and
save
all
the
trouble
about
the
brook
as
my
poor
father
had
longed
to
do
many
and
many
a
time
but
not
having
a
title
could
not
do
all
quite
as
he
wanted
and
then
if
we
young
people
grew
tired
of
the
old
mother
as
seemed
only
too
likely
and
was
according
to
nature
why
we
could
send
her
over
there
and
lizzie
to
keep
her
company
when
mother
had
finished
and
wiped
her
eyes
lorna
who
had
been
blushing
rosily
at
some
portions
of
this
great
speech
flung
her
fair
arms
around
mothers
neck
and
kissed
her
very
heartily
and
scolded
her
as
she
well
deserved
for
her
want
of
confidence
in
us
my
mother
replied
that
if
anybody
could
deserve
her
john
it
was
lorna
but
that
she
could
not
hold
with
the
rashness
of
giving
up
money
so
easily
while
her
nextofkin
would
be
john
himself
and
who
could
tell
what
others
by
the
time
she
was
oneandtwenty
hereupon
i
felt
that
after
all
my
mother
had
common
sense
on
her
side
for
if
master
snowes
farm
should
be
for
sale
it
would
be
far
more
to
the
purpose
than
my
coat
of
arms
to
get
it
for
there
was
a
different
pasture
there
just
suited
for
change
of
diet
to
our
sheep
as
well
as
large
cattle
and
beside
this
even
with
all
annies
skill
and
of
course
yet
more
now
she
was
gone
their
butter
would
always
command
in
the
market
from
one
to
three
farthings
a
pound
more
than
we
could
get
for
ours
and
few
things
vexed
us
more
than
this
whereas
if
we
got
possession
of
the
farm
we
might
without
breach
of
the
marketlaws
or
any
harm
done
to
any
one
the
price
being
but
a
prejudice
sell
all
our
butter
as
snowe
butter
and
do
good
to
all
our
customers
thinking
thus
yet
remembering
that
farmer
nicholas
might
hold
out
for
another
score
of
yearsas
i
heartily
hoped
he
mightor
that
one
if
not
all
of
his
comely
daughters
might
marry
a
good
young
farmer
or
farmers
if
the
case
were
soor
that
even
without
that
the
farm
might
never
be
put
up
for
sale
i
begged
my
lorna
to
do
as
she
liked
or
rather
to
wait
and
think
of
it
for
as
yet
she
could
do
nothing

beyond
endurance
also
known
as

upon

in
other
editions
everything
was
settled
smoothly
and
without
any
fear
or
fuss
that
lorna
might
find
end
of
troubles
and
myself
of
eager
waiting
with
the
help
of
parson
bowden
and
the
good
wishes
of
two
counties
i
could
scarce
believe
my
fortune
when
i
looked
upon
her
beauty
gentleness
and
sweetness
mingled
with
enough
of
humour
and
warm
womans
feeling
never
to
be
dull
or
tiring
never
themselves
to
be
weary
for
she
might
be
called
a
woman
now
although
a
very
young
one
and
as
full
of
playful
ways
or
perhaps
i
may
say
ten
times
as
full
as
if
she
had
known
no
trouble
to
wit
the
spirit
of
bright
childhood
having
been
so
curbed
and
straitened
ere
its
time
was
over
now
broke
forth
enriched
and
varied
with
the
garb
of
conscious
maidenhood
and
the
sense
of
steadfast
love
and
eager
love
enfolding
her
coloured
with
so
many
tinges
all
her
looks
and
words
and
thoughts
that
to
me
it
was
the
noblest
vision
even
to
think
about
her
but
this
was
far
too
bright
to
last
without
bitter
break
and
the
plunging
of
happiness
in
horror
and
of
passionate
joy
in
agony
my
darling
in
her
softest
moments
when
she
was
alone
with
me
when
the
spark
of
defiant
eyes
was
veiled
beneath
dark
lashes
and
the
challenge
of
gay
beauty
passed
into
sweetest
invitation
at
such
times
of
her
purest
love
and
warmest
faith
in
me
a
deep
abiding
fear
would
flutter
in
her
bounding
heart
as
of
deadly
fates
approach
she
would
cling
to
me
and
nestle
to
me
being
scared
of
coyishness
and
lay
one
arm
around
my
neck
and
ask
if
i
could
do
without
her
hence
as
all
emotions
haply
of
those
who
are
more
to
us
than
ourselves
find
within
us
stronger
echo
and
more
perfect
answer
so
i
could
not
be
regardless
of
some
hidden
evil
and
my
dark
misgivings
deepened
as
the
time
drew
nearer
i
kept
a
steadfast
watch
on
lorna
neglecting
a
field
of
beans
entirely
as
well
as
a
litter
of
young
pigs
and
a
cow
somewhat
given
to
jaundice
and
i
let
jem
slocombe
go
to
sleep
in
the
tallat
all
one
afternoon
and
bill
dadds
draw
off
a
bucket
of
cider
without
so
much
as
a
by
your
leave
for
these
men
knew
that
my
knighthood
and
my
coat
of
arms
and
most
of
all
my
love
were
greatly
against
good
farming
the
sense
of
our
country
beingand
perhaps
it
may
be
sensiblethat
a
man
who
sticks
up
to
be
anything
must
allow
himself
to
be
cheated
but
i
never
did
stick
up
nor
would
though
all
the
parish
bade
me
and
i
whistled
the
same
tunes
to
my
horses
and
held
my
ploughtree
just
the
same
as
if
no
king
nor
queen
had
ever
come
to
spoil
my
tune
or
hand
for
this
thing
nearly
all
the
men
around
our
parts
upbraided
me
but
the
women
praised
me
and
for
the
most
part
these
are
right
when
themselves
are
not
concerned
however
humble
i
might
be
no
one
knowing
anything
of
our
part
of
the
country
would
for
a
moment
doubt
that
now
here
was
a
great
to
do
and
talk
of
john
ridd
and
his
wedding
the
fierce
fight
with
the
doones
so
lately
and
my
leading
of
the
combat
though
i
fought
not
more
than
need
be
and
the
vanishing
of
sir
counsellor
and
the
galloping
madness
of
carver
and
the
religious
fear
of
the
women
that
this
last
was
gone
to
hellfor
he
himself
had
declared
that
his
aim
while
he
cut
through
the
yeomanryalso
their
remorse
that
he
should
have
been
made
to
go
thither
with
all
his
children
left
behindthese
things
i
say
if
ever
i
can
again
contrive
to
say
anything
had
led
to
the
broadest
excitement
about
my
wedding
of
lorna
we
heard
that
people
meant
to
come
from
more
than
thirty
miles
around
upon
excuse
of
seeing
my
stature
and
lornas
beauty
but
in
good
truth
out
of
sheer
curiosity
and
the
love
of
meddling
our
clerk
had
given
notice
that
not
a
man
should
come
inside
the
door
of
his
church
without
shillingfee
and
women
as
sure
to
see
twice
as
much
must
every
one
pay
two
shillings
i
thought
this
wrong
and
as
churchwarden
begged
that
the
money
might
be
paid
into
mine
own
hands
when
taken
but
the
clerk
said
that
was
against
all
law
and
he
had
orders
from
the
parson
to
pay
it
to
him
without
any
delay
so
as
i
always
obey
the
parson
when
i
care
not
much
about
a
thing
i
let
them
have
it
their
own
way
though
feeling
inclined
to
believe
sometimes
that
i
ought
to
have
some
of
the
money
dear
mother
arranged
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
way
in
which
it
was
to
be
done
and
annie
and
lizzie
and
all
the
snowes
and
even
ruth
huckaback
who
was
there
after
great
persuasion
made
such
a
sweeping
of
dresses
that
i
scarcely
knew
where
to
place
my
feet
and
longed
for
a
staff
to
put
by
their
gowns
then
lorna
came
out
of
a
pew
halfway
in
a
manner
which
quite
astonished
me
and
took
my
left
hand
in
her
right
and
i
prayed
god
that
it
were
done
with
my
darling
looked
so
glorious
that
i
was
afraid
of
glancing
at
her
yet
took
in
all
her
beauty
she
was
in
a
fright
no
doubt
but
nobody
should
see
it
whereas
i
said
to
myself
at
least
i
will
go
through
it
like
a
gravedigger
lornas
dress
was
of
pure
white
clouded
with
faint
lavender
for
the
sake
of
the
old
earl
brandir
and
as
simple
as
need
be
except
for
perfect
loveliness
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
her
as
i
said
before
except
when
each
of
us
said
i
will
and
then
each
dwelled
upon
the
other
it
is
impossible
for
any
who
have
not
loved
as
i
have
to
conceive
my
joy
and
pride
when
after
ring
and
all
was
done
and
the
parson
had
blessed
us
lorna
turned
to
look
at
me
with
her
glances
of
subtle
fun
subdued
by
this
great
act
her
eyes
which
none
on
earth
may
ever
equal
or
compare
with
told
me
such
a
depth
of
comfort
yet
awaiting
further
commune
that
i
was
almost
amazed
thoroughly
as
i
knew
them
darling
eyes
the
sweetest
eyes
the
loveliest
the
most
loving
eyesthe
sound
of
a
shot
rang
through
the
church
and
those
eyes
were
filled
with
death
lorna
fell
across
my
knees
when
i
was
going
to
kiss
her
as
the
bridegroom
is
allowed
to
do
and
encouraged
if
he
needs
it
a
flood
of
blood
came
out
upon
the
yellow
wood
of
the
altar
steps
and
at
my
feet
lay
lorna
trying
to
tell
me
some
last
message
out
of
her
faithful
eyes
i
lifted
her
up
and
petted
her
and
coaxed
her
but
it
was
no
good
the
only
sign
of
life
remaining
was
a
spirt
of
bright
red
blood
some
men
know
what
things
befall
them
in
the
supreme
time
of
their
lifefar
above
the
time
of
deathbut
to
me
comes
back
as
a
hazy
dream
without
any
knowledge
in
it
what
i
did
or
felt
or
thought
with
my
wifes
arms
flagging
flagging
around
my
neck
as
i
raised
her
up
and
softly
put
them
there
she
sighed
a
long
sigh
on
my
breast
for
her
last
farewell
to
life
and
then
she
grew
so
cold
and
cold
that
i
asked
the
time
of
year
it
was
whittuesday
and
the
lilacs
all
in
blossom
and
why
i
thought
of
the
time
of
year
with
the
young
death
in
my
arms
god
or
his
angels
may
decide
having
so
strangely
given
us
enough
that
so
i
did
and
looked
and
our
white
lilacs
were
beautiful
then
i
laid
my
wife
in
my
mothers
arms
and
begging
that
no
one
would
make
a
noise
went
forth
for
my
revenge
of
course
i
knew
who
had
done
it
there
was
but
one
man
in
the
world
or
at
any
rate
in
our
part
of
it
who
could
have
done
such
a
thingsuch
a
thing
i
use
no
harsher
word
about
it
while
i
leaped
upon
our
best
horse
with
bridle
but
no
saddle
and
set
the
head
of
kickums
towards
the
course
now
pointed
out
to
me
who
showed
me
the
course
i
cannot
tell
i
only
know
that
i
took
it
and
the
men
fell
back
before
me
weapon
of
no
sort
had
i
unarmed
and
wondering
at
my
strange
attire
with
a
bridal
vest
wrought
by
our
annie
and
red
with
the
blood
of
the
bride
i
went
forth
just
to
find
out
this
whether
in
this
world
there
be
or
be
not
god
of
justice
with
my
vicious
horse
at
a
furious
speed
i
came
upon
black
barrow
down
directed
by
some
shout
of
men
which
seemed
to
me
but
a
whisper
and
there
about
a
furlong
before
me
rode
a
man
on
a
great
black
horse
and
i
knew
that
the
man
was
carver
doone
your
life
or
mine
i
said
to
myself
as
the
will
of
god
may
be
but
we
two
live
not
upon
this
earth
one
more
hour
together
i
knew
the
strength
of
this
great
man
and
i
knew
that
he
was
armed
with
a
gunif
he
had
time
to
load
again
after
shooting
my
lornaor
at
any
rate
with
pistols
and
a
horsemans
sword
as
well
nevertheless
i
had
no
more
doubt
of
killing
the
man
before
me
than
a
cook
has
of
spitting
a
headless
fowl
sometimes
seeing
no
ground
beneath
me
and
sometimes
heeding
every
leaf
and
the
crossing
of
the
grassblades
i
followed
over
the
long
moor
reckless
whether
seen
or
not
but
only
once
the
other
man
turned
round
and
looked
back
again
and
then
i
was
beside
a
rock
with
a
reedy
swamp
behind
me
although
he
was
so
far
before
me
and
riding
as
hard
as
ride
he
might
i
saw
that
he
had
something
on
the
horse
in
front
of
him
something
which
needed
care
and
stopped
him
from
looking
backward
in
the
whirling
of
my
wits
i
fancied
first
that
this
was
lorna
until
the
scene
i
had
been
through
fell
across
hot
brain
and
heart
like
the
drop
at
the
close
of
a
tragedy
rushing
there
through
crag
and
quag
at
utmost
speed
of
a
maddened
horse
i
saw
as
of
anothers
fate
calmly
as
on
canvas
laid
the
brutal
deed
the
piteous
anguish
and
the
cold
despair
the
man
turned
up
the
gully
leading
from
the
moor
to
cloven
rocks
through
which
john
fry
had
tracked
uncle
ben
as
of
old
related
but
as
carver
entered
it
he
turned
round
and
beheld
me
not
a
hundred
yards
behind
and
i
saw
that
he
was
bearing
his
child
little
ensie
before
him
ensie
also
descried
me
and
stretched
his
hands
and
cried
to
me
for
the
face
of
his
father
frightened
him
carver
doone
with
a
vile
oath
thrust
spurs
into
his
flagging
horse
and
laid
one
hand
on
a
pistolstock
whence
i
knew
that
his
slung
carbine
had
received
no
bullet
since
the
one
that
had
pierced
lorna
and
a
cry
of
triumph
rose
from
the
black
depths
of
my
heart
what
cared
i
for
pistols
i
had
no
spurs
neither
was
my
horse
one
to
need
the
rowel
i
rather
held
him
in
than
urged
him
for
he
was
fresh
as
ever
and
i
knew
that
the
black
steed
in
front
if
he
breasted
the
steep
ascent
where
the
track
divided
must
be
in
our
reach
at
once
his
rider
knew
this
and
having
no
room
in
the
rocky
channel
to
turn
and
fire
drew
rein
at
the
crossways
sharply
and
plunged
into
the
black
ravine
leading
to
the
wizards
slough
is
it
so
i
said
to
myself
with
a
brain
and
head
cold
as
iron
though
the
foul
fiend
come
from
the
slough
to
save
thee
thou
shalt
carve
it
carver
i
followed
my
enemy
carefully
steadily
even
leisurely
for
i
had
him
as
in
a
pitfall
whence
no
escape
might
be
he
thought
that
i
feared
to
approach
him
for
he
knew
not
where
he
was
and
his
low
disdainful
laugh
came
back
laugh
he
who
wins
thought
i
a
gnarled
and
halfstarved
oak
as
stubborn
as
my
own
resolve
and
smitten
by
some
storm
of
old
hung
from
the
crag
above
me
rising
from
my
horses
back
although
i
had
no
stirrups
i
caught
a
limb
and
tore
it
like
a
mere
wheatawn
from
the
socket
men
show
the
rent
even
now
with
wonder
none
with
more
wonder
than
myself
carver
doone
turned
the
corner
suddenly
on
the
black
and
bottomless
bog
with
a
start
of
fear
he
reined
back
his
horse
and
i
thought
he
would
have
turned
upon
me
but
instead
of
that
he
again
rode
on
hoping
to
find
a
way
round
the
side
now
there
is
a
way
between
cliff
and
slough
for
those
who
know
the
ground
thoroughly
or
have
time
enough
to
search
it
but
for
him
there
was
no
road
and
he
lost
some
time
in
seeking
it
upon
this
he
made
up
his
mind
and
wheeling
fired
and
then
rode
at
me
his
bullet
struck
me
somewhere
but
i
took
no
heed
of
that
fearing
only
his
escape
i
laid
my
horse
across
the
way
and
with
the
limb
of
the
oak
struck
full
on
the
forehead
his
charging
steed
ere
the
slash
of
the
sword
came
nigh
me
man
and
horse
rolled
over
and
wellnigh
bore
my
own
horse
down
with
the
power
of
their
onset
carver
doone
was
somewhat
stunned
and
could
not
arise
for
a
moment
meanwhile
i
leaped
on
the
ground
and
awaited
smoothing
my
hair
back
and
baring
my
arms
as
though
in
the
ring
for
wrestling
then
the
little
boy
ran
to
me
clasped
my
leg
and
looked
up
at
me
and
the
terror
in
his
eyes
made
me
almost
fear
myself
ensie
dear
i
said
quite
gently
grieving
that
he
should
see
his
wicked
father
killed
run
up
yonder
round
the
corner
and
try
to
find
a
pretty
bunch
of
bluebells
for
the
lady
the
child
obeyed
me
hanging
back
and
looking
back
and
then
laughing
while
i
prepared
for
business
there
and
then
i
might
have
killed
mine
enemy
with
a
single
blow
while
he
lay
unconscious
but
it
would
have
been
foul
play
with
a
sullen
and
black
scowl
the
carver
gathered
his
mighty
limbs
and
arose
and
looked
round
for
his
weapons
but
i
had
put
them
well
away
then
he
came
to
me
and
gazed
being
wont
to
frighten
thus
young
men
i
would
not
harm
you
lad
he
said
with
a
lofty
style
of
sneering
i
have
punished
you
enough
for
most
of
your
impertinence
for
the
rest
i
forgive
you
because
you
have
been
good
and
gracious
to
my
little
son
go
and
be
contented
for
answer
i
smote
him
on
the
cheek
lightly
and
not
to
hurt
him
but
to
make
his
blood
leap
up
i
would
not
sully
my
tongue
by
speaking
to
a
man
like
this
there
was
a
level
space
of
sward
between
us
and
the
slough
with
the
courtesy
derived
from
london
and
the
processions
i
had
seen
to
this
place
i
led
him
and
that
he
might
breathe
himself
and
have
every
fibre
cool
and
every
muscle
ready
my
hold
upon
his
coat
i
loosed
and
left
him
to
begin
with
me
whenever
he
thought
proper
i
think
that
he
felt
that
his
time
was
come
i
think
he
knew
from
my
knitted
muscles
and
the
firm
arch
of
my
breast
and
the
way
in
which
i
stood
but
most
of
all
from
my
stern
blue
eyes
that
he
had
found
his
master
at
any
rate
a
paleness
came
an
ashy
paleness
on
his
cheeks
and
the
vast
calves
of
his
legs
bowed
in
as
if
he
were
out
of
training
seeing
this
villain
as
he
was
i
offered
him
first
chance
i
stretched
forth
my
left
hand
as
i
do
to
a
weaker
antagonist
and
i
let
him
have
the
hug
of
me
but
in
this
i
was
too
generous
having
forgotten
my
pistolwound
and
the
cracking
of
one
of
my
short
lower
ribs
carver
doone
caught
me
round
the
waist
with
such
a
grip
as
never
yet
had
been
laid
upon
me
i
heard
my
rib
go
i
grasped
his
arm
and
tore
the
muscle
out
of
it
as
the
string
comes
out
of
an
orange
then
i
took
him
by
the
throat
which
is
not
allowed
in
wrestling
but
he
had
snatched
at
mine
and
now
was
no
time
of
dalliance
in
vain
he
tugged
and
strained
and
writhed
dashed
his
bleeding
fist
into
my
face
and
flung
himself
on
me
with
gnashing
jaws
beneath
the
iron
of
my
strengthfor
god
that
day
was
with
mei
had
him
helpless
in
two
minutes
and
his
fiery
eyes
lolled
out

a
far
more
terrible
clutch
than
this
is
handed
down
to
weaker
ages
of
the
great
john
ridded
i
will
not
harm
thee
any
more
i
cried
so
far
as
i
could
for
panting
the
work
being
very
furious
carver
doone
thou
art
beaten
own
it
and
thank
god
for
it
and
go
thy
way
and
repent
thyself
it
was
all
too
late
even
if
he
had
yielded
in
his
ravening
frenzyfor
his
beard
was
like
a
mad
dogs
jowleven
if
he
would
have
owned
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
found
his
master
it
was
all
too
late
the
black
bog
had
him
by
the
feet
the
sucking
of
the
ground
drew
on
him
like
the
thirsty
lips
of
death
in
our
fury
we
had
heeded
neither
wet
nor
dry
nor
thought
of
earth
beneath
us
i
myself
might
scarcely
leap
with
the
last
spring
of
oerlaboured
legs
from
the
engulfing
grave
of
slime
he
fell
back
with
his
swarthy
breast
from
which
my
gripe
had
rent
all
clothing
like
a
hummock
of
bogoak
standing
out
the
quagmire
and
then
he
tossed
his
arms
to
heaven
and
they
were
black
to
the
elbow
and
the
glare
of
his
eyes
was
ghastly
i
could
only
gaze
and
pant
for
my
strength
was
no
more
than
an
infants
from
the
fury
and
the
horror
scarcely
could
i
turn
away
while
joint
by
joint
he
sank
from
sight
chapter
lxxv
life
and
lorna
come
again
when
the
little
boy
came
back
with
the
bluebells
which
he
had
managed
to
findas
children
always
do
find
flowers
when
older
eyes
see
nonethe
only
sign
of
his
father
left
was
a
dark
brown
bubble
upon
a
newly
formed
patch
of
blackness
but
to
the
center
of
its
pulpy
gorge
the
greedy
slough
was
heaving
and
sullenly
grinding
its
weltering
jaws
among
the
flags
and
the
sedges
with
pain
and
ache
both
of
mind
and
body
and
shame
at
my
own
fury
i
heavily
mounted
my
horse
again
and
looked
down
at
the
innocent
ensie
would
this
playful
loving
child
grow
up
like
his
cruel
father
and
end
a
godless
life
of
hatred
with
a
death
of
violence
he
lifted
his
noble
forehead
towards
me
as
if
to
answer
nay
i
will
not
but
the
words
he
spoke
were
these
donfor
he
could
never
say
johnoh
don
i
am
so
glad
that
nasty
naughty
man
is
gone
away
take
me
home
don
take
me
home
it
has
been
said
of
the
wicked
not
even
their
own
children
love
them
and
i
could
easily
believe
that
carver
doones
coldhearted
ways
had
scared
from
him
even
his
favorite
child
no
man
would
i
call
truly
wicked
unless
his
heart
be
cold
it
hurt
me
more
than
i
can
tell
even
through
all
other
grief
to
take
into
my
arms
the
child
of
the
man
just
slain
by
me
the
feeling
was
a
foolish
one
and
a
wrong
one
as
the
thing
has
beenfor
i
would
fain
have
saved
that
man
after
he
was
conquerednevertheless
my
arms
went
coldly
round
that
little
fellow
neither
would
they
have
gone
at
all
if
there
had
been
any
help
for
it
but
i
could
not
leave
him
there
till
some
one
else
might
fetch
him
on
account
of
the
cruel
slough
and
the
ravens
which
had
come
hovering
over
the
dead
horse
neither
could
i
with
my
wound
tie
him
on
my
horse
and
walk
for
now
i
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
blood
and
was
rather
faint
and
weary
and
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
kickums
had
lost
spirit
like
his
master
and
went
home
as
mildly
as
a
lamb
for
when
we
came
towards
the
farm
i
seemed
to
be
riding
in
a
dream
almost
and
the
voices
both
of
man
and
women
who
had
hurried
forth
upon
my
track
as
they
met
me
seemed
to
wander
from
a
distant
muffling
cloud
only
the
thought
of
lornas
death
like
a
heavy
knell
was
tolling
in
the
belfry
of
my
brain
when
we
came
to
the
stable
door
i
rather
fell
from
my
horse
than
got
off
and
john
fry
with
a
look
of
wonder
took
kickums
head
and
led
him
in
into
the
old
farmhouse
i
tottered
like
a
weanling
child
with
mother
in
her
common
clothes
helping
me
along
yet
fearing
except
by
stealth
to
look
at
me
i
have
killed
him
was
all
i
said
even
as
he
killed
lorna
now
let
me
see
my
wife
mother
she
belongs
to
me
none
the
less
though
dead
you
cannot
see
her
now
dear
john
said
ruth
huckaback
coming
forward
since
no
one
else
had
the
courage
annie
is
with
her
now
john
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
let
me
see
my
dead
one
and
pray
myself
to
die
all
the
women
fell
away
and
whispered
and
looked
at
me
with
side
glances
and
some
sobbing
for
my
face
was
hard
as
flint
ruth
alone
stood
by
me
and
dropped
her
eyes
and
trembled
then
one
little
hand
of
hers
stole
into
my
great
shaking
palm
and
the
other
was
laid
on
my
tattered
coat
yet
with
her
clothes
she
shunned
my
blood
while
she
whispered
gently
john
she
is
not
your
dead
one
she
may
even
be
your
living
one
yet
your
wife
your
home
and
your
happiness
but
you
must
not
see
her
now
is
there
any
chance
for
her
for
me
i
mean
for
me
i
mean
god
in
heaven
knows
dear
john
but
the
sight
of
you
and
in
this
sad
plight
would
be
certain
death
to
her
now
come
first
and
be
healed
yourself
i
obeyed
her
like
a
child
whispering
only
as
i
went
for
none
but
myself
knew
her
goodnessalmighty
god
will
bless
you
darling
for
the
good
you
are
doing
now
tenfold
ay
and
a
thousandfold
i
prayed
and
i
believed
it
when
i
came
to
know
the
truth
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
little
maid
lorna
must
have
died
at
once
as
in
my
arms
she
lay
for
dead
from
the
dastard
and
murderous
cruelty
but
the
moment
i
left
her
ruth
came
forward
and
took
the
command
of
every
one
in
right
of
her
firmness
and
readiness
she
made
them
bear
her
home
at
once
upon
the
door
of
the
pulpit
with
the
cushion
under
the
drooping
head
with
her
own
little
hands
she
cut
off
as
tenderly
as
a
pear
is
peeled
the
bridaldress
so
steeped
and
stained
and
then
with
her
dainty
transparent
fingers
no
larger
than
a
pencil
she
probed
the
vile
wound
in
the
side
and
fetched
the
reeking
bullet
forth
and
then
with
the
coldest
water
stanched
the
flowing
of
the
lifeblood
all
this
while
my
darling
lay
insensible
and
white
as
death
and
needed
nothing
but
her
maiden
shroud
but
ruth
still
sponged
the
poor
side
and
forehead
and
watched
the
long
eyelashes
flat
upon
the
marble
cheek
and
laid
her
pure
face
on
the
faint
heart
and
bade
them
fetch
her
spanish
wine
then
she
parted
the
pearly
teeth
feebly
clenched
on
the
hovering
breath
and
poured
in
wine
from
a
christening
spoon
and
raised
the
graceful
neck
and
breast
and
stroked
the
delicate
throat
and
waited
and
then
poured
in
a
little
more
annie
all
the
while
looked
on
with
horror
and
amazement
counting
herself
no
secondrate
nurse
and
this
as
against
all
theory
but
the
quiet
lifting
of
ruths
hand
and
one
glance
from
her
dark
bright
eyes
told
annie
just
to
stand
away
and
not
intercept
the
air
so
and
at
the
very
moment
when
all
the
rest
had
settled
that
ruth
was
a
simple
idiot
but
could
not
harm
the
dead
much
a
little
flutter
in
the
throat
followed
by
a
short
low
sigh
made
them
pause
and
look
and
hope
for
hours
however
and
days
she
lay
at
the
very
verge
of
death
kept
alive
by
nothing
but
the
care
the
skill
the
tenderness
and
the
perpetual
watchfulness
of
ruth
luckily
annie
was
not
there
very
often
so
as
to
meddle
for
kind
and
clever
nurse
as
she
was
she
must
have
done
more
harm
than
good
but
my
broken
rib
which
was
set
by
a
doctor
who
chanced
to
be
at
the
wedding
was
allotted
to
annies
care
and
great
inflammation
ensuing
it
was
quite
enough
to
content
her
this
doctor
had
pronounced
poor
lorna
dead
wherefore
ruth
refused
most
firmly
to
have
aught
to
do
with
him
she
took
the
whole
case
on
herself
and
with
gods
help
she
bore
it
through
now
whether
it
were
the
light
and
brightness
of
my
lornas
nature
or
the
freedom
from
anxietyfor
she
knew
not
of
my
hurtor
as
some
people
said
her
birthright
among
wounds
and
violence
or
her
manner
of
not
drinking
beeri
leave
that
doctor
to
determine
who
pronounced
her
dead
but
anyhow
one
thing
is
certain
sure
as
stars
of
hope
above
us
lorna
recovered
long
ere
i
did
for
the
grief
was
on
me
still
of
having
lost
my
love
and
lover
at
the
moment
she
was
mine
with
the
power
of
fate
upon
me
and
the
black
cauldron
of
the
wizards
death
boiling
in
my
heated
brain
i
had
no
faith
in
the
tales
they
told
i
believed
that
lorna
was
in
the
churchyard
while
these
rogues
were
lying
to
me
for
with
strength
of
blood
like
mine
and
power
of
heart
behind
it
a
broken
bone
must
burn
itself
mine
went
hard
with
fires
of
pain
being
of
such
size
and
thickness
and
i
was
ashamed
of
him
for
breaking
by
reason
of
a
pistolball
and
the
mere
hug
of
a
man
and
it
fetched
me
down
in
conceit
of
strength
so
that
i
was
careful
afterwards
all
this
was
a
lesson
to
me
all
this
made
me
very
humble
illness
being
a
thing
as
yet
altogether
unknown
to
me
not
that
i
cried
small
or
skulked
or
feared
the
death
which
some
foretold
shaking
their
heads
about
mortification
and
a
green
appearance
only
that
i
seemed
quite
fit
to
go
to
heaven
and
lorna
for
in
my
sick
distracted
mind
stirred
with
many
tossings
like
the
bead
in
the
spread
of
frogspawn
carried
by
the
current
hung
the
black
and
central
essence
of
my
future
life
a
life
without
lorna
a
tadpole
life
all
stupid
head
and
no
body
many
men
may
like
such
life
anchorites
fakirs
highpriests
and
so
on
but
to
my
mind
it
is
not
the
native
thing
god
meant
for
us
my
dearest
mother
was
a
show
with
crying
and
with
fretting
the
doones
as
she
thought
were
born
to
destroy
us
scarce
had
she
come
to
some
liveliness
though
sprinkled
with
tears
every
now
and
then
after
her
great
bereavement
and
ten
years
time
to
dwell
on
itwhen
lo
here
was
her
husbands
son
the
pet
child
of
her
own
good
john
murdered
like
his
father
well
the
ways
of
god
were
wonderful
so
they
were
and
so
they
are
and
so
they
ever
will
be
let
us
debate
them
as
we
will
our
ways
are
his
and
much
the
same
only
secondhand
from
him
and
i
expected
something
from
him
even
in
my
worst
of
times
knowing
that
i
had
done
my
best
this
is
not
edifying
talkas
our
nonconformist
parson
says
when
he
can
get
no
more
to
drinktherefore
let
me
only
tell
what
became
of
lorna
one
day
i
was
sitting
in
my
bedroom
for
i
could
not
get
downstairs
and
there
was
no
one
strong
enough
to
carry
me
even
if
i
would
have
allowed
it
though
it
cost
me
sore
trouble
and
weariness
i
had
put
on
all
my
sunday
clothes
out
of
respect
for
the
doctor
who
was
coming
to
bleed
me
again
as
he
always
did
twice
a
week
and
it
struck
me
that
he
had
seemed
hurt
in
his
mind
because
i
wore
my
worst
clothes
to
be
bled
infor
lie
in
bed
i
would
not
after
six
oclock
and
even
that
was
great
laziness
i
looked
at
my
right
hand
whose
grasp
had
been
like
that
of
a
blacksmiths
vice
and
it
seemed
to
myself
impossible
that
this
could
be
john
ridds
the
great
frame
of
the
hand
was
there
as
well
as
the
muscles
standing
forth
like
the
guttering
of
a
candle
and
the
broad
blue
veins
going
up
the
back
and
crossing
every
finger
but
as
for
colour
even
lornas
could
scarcely
have
been
whiter
and
as
for
strength
little
ensie
doone
might
have
come
and
held
it
fast
i
laughed
as
i
tried
in
vain
to
lift
the
basin
set
for
bleeding
me
then
i
thought
of
all
the
lovely
things
going
on
outofdoors
just
now
concerning
which
the
drowsy
song
of
the
bees
came
to
me
these
must
be
among
the
thyme
by
the
sound
of
their
great
content
therefore
the
roses
must
be
in
blossom
and
the
woodbine
and
clovegillyflower
the
cherries
on
the
wall
must
be
turning
red
the
yellow
sally
must
be
on
the
brook
wheat
must
be
callow
with
quavering
bloom
and
the
early
meadows
swathed
with
hay
yet
here
was
i
a
helpless
creature
quite
unfit
to
stir
among
them
gifted
with
no
sight
no
scent
of
all
the
changes
that
move
our
love
and
lead
our
hearts
from
month
to
month
along
the
quiet
path
of
life
and
what
was
worse
i
had
no
hope
of
caring
ever
for
them
more
presently
a
little
knock
sounded
through
my
gloomy
room
and
supposing
it
to
be
the
doctor
i
tried
to
rise
and
make
my
bow
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
little
ruth
who
had
never
once
come
to
visit
me
since
i
was
placed
under
the
doctors
hands
ruth
was
dressed
so
gaily
with
rosettes
and
flowers
and
what
not
that
i
was
sorry
for
her
bad
manners
and
thought
she
was
come
to
conquer
me
now
that
lorna
was
done
with
ruth
ran
towards
me
with
sparkling
eyes
being
rather
short
of
sight
then
suddenly
she
stopped
and
i
saw
entire
amazement
in
her
face
can
you
receive
visitors
cousin
riddwhy
they
never
told
me
of
this
she
cried
i
knew
that
you
were
weak
dear
john
but
not
that
you
were
dying
whatever
is
that
basin
for
i
have
no
intention
of
dying
ruth
and
i
like
not
to
talk
about
it
but
that
basin
if
you
must
know
is
for
the
doctors
purpose
what
do
you
mean
bleeding
you
you
poor
weak
cousin
is
it
possible
that
he
does
that
still
twice
a
week
for
the
last
six
weeks
dear
nothing
else
has
kept
me
alive
nothing
else
has
killed
you
nearly
there
and
she
set
her
little
boot
across
the
basin
and
crushed
it
not
another
drop
shall
they
have
from
you
is
annie
such
a
fool
as
that
and
lizzie
like
a
zany
at
her
books
and
killing
her
brother
between
them
i
was
surprised
to
see
ruth
excited
her
character
being
so
calm
and
quiet
and
i
tried
to
soothe
her
with
my
feeble
hand
as
now
she
knelt
before
me
dear
cousin
the
doctor
must
know
best
annie
says
so
every
day
what
has
he
been
brought
up
for
brought
up
for
slaying
and
murdering
twenty
doctors
killed
king
charles
in
spite
of
all
the
women
will
you
leave
it
to
me
john
i
have
a
little
will
of
my
own
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
doctors
will
you
leave
it
to
me
dear
john
i
have
saved
your
lornas
life
and
now
i
will
save
yours
which
is
a
far
far
easier
business
you
have
saved
my
lornas
life
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
so
only
what
i
say
cousin
john
though
perhaps
i
overprize
my
work
but
at
any
rate
she
says
so
i
do
not
understand
i
said
falling
back
with
bewilderment
all
women
are
such
liars
have
you
ever
known
me
tell
a
lie
ruth
in
great
indignationmore
feigned
i
doubt
than
realyour
mother
may
tell
a
story
now
and
then
when
she
feels
it
right
and
so
may
both
your
sisters
but
so
you
cannot
do
john
ridd
and
no
more
than
you
can
i
do
it
if
ever
there
was
virtuous
truth
in
the
eyes
of
any
woman
it
was
now
in
ruth
huckabacks
and
my
brain
began
very
slowly
to
move
the
heart
being
almost
torpid
from
perpetual
loss
of
blood
i
do
not
understand
was
all
i
could
say
for
a
very
long
time
will
you
understand
if
i
show
you
lorna
i
have
feared
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
you
both
but
now
lorna
is
well
enough
if
you
think
that
you
are
cousin
john
surely
you
will
understand
when
you
see
your
wife
following
her
to
the
very
utmost
of
my
mind
and
heart
i
felt
that
all
she
said
was
truth
and
yet
i
could
not
make
it
out
and
in
her
last
few
words
there
was
such
a
power
of
sadness
rising
through
the
cover
of
gaiety
that
i
said
to
myself
half
in
a
dream
ruth
is
very
beautiful
before
i
had
time
to
listen
much
for
the
approach
of
footsteps
ruth
came
back
and
behind
her
lorna
coy
as
if
of
her
bridegroom
and
hanging
back
with
her
beauty
ruth
banged
the
door
and
ran
away
and
lorna
stood
before
me
but
she
did
not
stand
for
an
instant
when
she
saw
what
i
was
like
at
the
risk
of
all
thick
bandages
and
upsetting
a
dozen
medicine
bottles
and
scattering
leeches
right
and
left
she
managed
to
get
into
my
arms
although
they
could
not
hold
her
she
laid
her
panting
warm
young
breast
on
the
place
where
they
meant
to
bleed
me
and
she
set
my
pale
face
up
and
she
would
not
look
at
me
having
greater
faith
in
kissing
i
felt
my
life
come
back
and
warm
i
felt
my
trust
in
women
flow
i
felt
the
joys
of
living
now
and
the
power
of
doing
it
it
is
not
a
moment
to
describe
who
feels
can
never
tell
of
it
but
the
rush
of
lornas
tears
and
the
challenge
of
my
brides
lips
and
the
throbbing
of
my
wifes
heart
now
at
last
at
home
on
mine
made
me
feel
that
the
world
was
good
and
not
a
thing
to
be
weary
of
little
more
have
i
to
tell
the
doctor
was
turned
out
at
once
and
slowly
came
back
my
former
strength
with
a
darling
wife
and
good
victuals
as
for
lorna
she
never
tired
of
sitting
and
watching
me
eat
and
eat
and
such
is
her
heart
that
she
never
tires
of
being
with
me
here
and
there
among
the
beautiful
places
and
talking
with
her
arm
around
meso
far
at
least
as
it
can
go
though
half
of
mine
may
go
round
herof
the
many
fears
and
troubles
dangers
and
discouragements
and
worst
of
all
the
bitter
partings
which
we
used
to
have
somehow
there
is
no
need
for
my
farming
harder
than
becomes
a
man
of
weight
lorna
has
great
stores
of
money
though
we
never
draw
it
out
except
for
some
poor
neighbor
unless
i
find
her
a
sumptuous
dress
out
of
her
own
perquisites
and
this
she
always
looks
upon
as
a
wondrous
gift
from
me
and
kisses
me
much
when
she
puts
it
on
and
walks
like
the
noble
woman
she
is
and
yet
i
may
never
behold
it
again
for
she
gets
back
to
her
simple
clothes
and
i
love
her
the
better
in
them
i
believe
that
she
gives
half
the
grandeur
away
and
keeps
the
other
half
for
the
children
as
for
poor
tom
faggus
every
one
knows
his
bitter
adventures
when
his
pardon
was
recalled
because
of
his
journey
to
sedgemoor
not
a
child
in
the
country
i
doubt
but
knows
far
more
than
i
do
of
toms
most
desperate
doings
the
law
had
ruined
him
once
he
said
and
then
he
had
been
too
much
for
the
law
and
now
that
a
quiet
life
was
his
object
here
the
base
thing
came
after
him
and
such
was
his
dread
of
this
evil
spirit
that
being
caught
upon
barnstaple
bridge
with
soldiers
at
either
end
of
it
yet
doubtful
about
approaching
him
he
set
his
strawberry
mare
sweet
winnie
at
the
lefthand
parapet
with
a
whisper
into
her
dovecoloured
ear
without
a
moments
doubt
she
leaped
it
into
the
foaming
tide
and
swam
and
landed
according
to
orders
also
his
flight
from
a
publichouse
where
a
trap
was
set
for
him
but
winnie
came
and
broke
down
the
door
and
put
two
men
under
and
trod
on
them
is
as
well
known
as
any
ballad
it
was
reported
for
awhile
that
poor
tom
had
been
caught
at
last
by
means
of
his
fondness
for
liquor
and
was
hanged
before
taunton
jail
but
luckily
we
knew
better
with
a
good
wife
and
a
wonderful
horse
and
all
the
country
attached
to
him
he
kept
the
law
at
a
wholesome
distance
until
it
became
too
much
for
its
master
and
a
new
king
arose
upon
this
tom
sued
his
pardon
afresh
and
jeremy
stickles
who
suited
the
times
was
glad
to
help
him
in
getting
it
as
well
as
a
compensation
thereafter
the
good
and
respectable
tom
lived
a
godly
though
not
always
sober
life
and
brought
up
his
children
to
honesty
as
the
first
of
all
qualifications
my
dear
mother
was
as
happy
as
possibly
need
be
with
us
having
no
cause
for
jealousy
as
others
arose
around
her
and
everybody
was
well
pleased
when
lizzy
came
in
one
day
and
tossed
her
bookshelf
over
and
declared
that
she
would
have
captain
bloxham
and
nobody
should
prevent
her
for
that
he
alone
of
all
the
men
she
had
ever
met
with
knew
good
writing
when
he
saw
it
and
could
spell
a
word
when
told
as
he
had
now
succeeded
to
captain
stickles
position
stickles
going
up
the
tree
and
had
the
power
of
collecting
and
of
keeping
what
he
liked
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
against
it
and
we
hoped
that
he
would
pay
her
out
i
sent
little
ensie
to
blundells
school
at
my
own
cost
and
charges
having
changed
his
name
for
fear
of
what
anyone
might
do
to
him
i
called
him
ensie
jones
and
we
got
him
a
commission
and
after
many
scrapes
of
spirit
he
did
great
things
in
the
low
countries
he
looks
upon
me
as
his
father
and
without
my
leave
will
not
lay
claim
to
the
heritage
and
title
of
the
doones
which
clearly
belong
to
him
ruth
huckaback
is
not
married
yet
although
upon
uncle
reubens
death
she
came
into
all
his
property
except
indeed
2000
pounds
which
uncle
ben
in
his
driest
manner
bequeathed
to
sir
john
ridd
the
worshipful
knight
for
greasing
of
the
testators
boots
and
he
left
almost
a
mint
of
money
not
from
the
mine
but
from
the
shop
and
the
good
use
of
usury
for
the
mine
had
brought
in
just
what
it
cost
when
the
vein
of
gold
ended
suddenly
leaving
all
concerned
much
older
and
some
i
fear
much
poorer
but
no
one
utterly
ruined
as
is
the
case
with
most
of
them
ruth
herself
was
his
true
mine
as
upon
deathbed
he
found
i
know
a
man
even
worthy
of
her
and
though
she
is
not
very
young
he
loves
her
as
i
love
lorna
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
in
the
end
he
will
win
her
and
i
do
not
mean
to
dance
again
except
at
dear
ruths
wedding
if
the
floor
be
strong
enough
of
lorna
of
my
lifelong
darling
of
my
more
and
more
loved
wife
i
will
not
talk
for
it
is
not
seemly
that
a
man
should
exalt
his
pride
year
by
year
her
beauty
grows
with
the
growth
of
goodness
kindness
and
true
happinessabove
all
with
loving
for
change
she
makes
a
joke
of
this
and
plays
with
it
and
laughs
at
it
and
then
when
my
slow
nature
marvels
back
she
comes
to
the
earnest
thing
and
if
i
wish
to
pay
her
out
for
something
very
dreadfulas
may
happen

preface
to
the
american
edition
among
the
works
of
every
writer
of
fiction
there
are
generally
one
or
two
that
owe
their
being
to
some
haunting
thought
long
communed
witha
thought
which
has
at
last
found
a
living
shape
in
some
story
of
deed
and
passion
i
say
one
or
two
advisedly
for
the
span
of
mans
active
life
is
short
and
such
haunting
fancies
are
of
their
essence
solitary
as
a
matter
of
fact
indeed
the
majority
of
a
novelists
creations
belong
to
another
class
must
of
necessity
if
he
be
a
prolific
creator
find
their
conception
in
more
sudden
impulses
the
great
family
of
the
children
of
his
brain
must
be
born
of
inspirations
ever
new
and
in
alluring
freshness
go
forth
into
the
world
surrounded
by
the
atmosphere
of
their
authors
present
mood
decked
in
the
colours
of
his
latest
imaginings
strengthened
by
his
latest
passional
impressions
and
philosophical
conclusions
in
the
latter
category
the
lack
of
long
intimate
acquaintance
between
the
author
and
the
friends
or
foes
he
depicts
is
amply
compensated
for
by
the
enthusiasm
appertaining
to
new
discoveries
as
each
character
reveals
itself
often

here
by
the
way
i
should
like
to
say
my
word
in
honour
of
fictionfiction
contradistinguished
from
what
is
popularly
termed
serious
writing
if
in
a
story
the
characters
and
the
events
are
truly
convincing
if
the
former
are
appealingly
human
and
the
latter
are
so
carefully
devised
and
described
as
never
to
evoke
the
idea
of
improbability
then
it
can
make
no
difference
in
the
intellectual
pleasure
of
the
reader
whether
what
he
is
made
to
realise
so
vividly
is
a
record
of
fact
or
of
mere
fancy
facts
we
read
of
are
of
necessity
past
what
is
past
what
is
beyond
the
immediate
ken
of
our
senses
can
only
be
realised
in
imagination
and
the
picture
we
are
able
to
make
of
it
for
ourselves
depends
altogether
on
the
sympathetic
skill
of
the

whose

was
so
undeniably
tangible
to
the

we

it

very
little
therefore
whether
the
man
or
the
woman
we
read
of
but
never
can
see
in
the
flesh
has

not
if
what
we
do
read
raises
an
emotion
in
our
hearts
to
the
novelist
every
character
each
in
his
own
degree
is
almost
as
living
as
a
personal
acquaintance
every
event
is
as
clear
as
a

the

where
both

characters
unfold
themselves
like
the

of
some
unknown
plant
how
much
more
strongly
is
it
the
case
of
the
story
that
has
so
long
been
mused
over
that
one
day
it
had
to
be
told
then
the
marking

their
sayings
and
doings
noble
or
bright
or
mistaken
recorded
in
the
book
are
but
a
tithe
of
the
adventures
sayings
and
doings
with
which
the
writer
seems
to
be
familiar
he
might
write
or
talk
about
them
in
praise
or
vindictiveness
as
he
loves
or
dreads
them
for
many
a
longer
daybut
he
has
one
main
theme
to
make
clear
to
his
hearers
and
must
respect
the
modern
canons
of
the
storytelling
art
among
the
many
things
therefore
he
could
tell
an
he
would
he
selects
that
only
which
will
unravel
a
particular
thread
of
fate
in
the
tangle
of
endless
consequences
which
will
render
plausible
the
growth
of
passions
on
which
in
a
continuous
lifedrama
is
based
one
particular
episode
of
such
a
kind
is
the
story
of
adrian
landale
the
haunting
thought
round
which
the
tale
of
the
sorely
tempesttossed
dreamer
is
gathered
is
one
which
i
think
must
at
one
time
or
other
have
occurred
to
many
a
man
as
he
neared
the
maturity
of
middlelifewhat
form
of
turmoil
would
come
into
his
heart
if
when
still
in
the
strength
of
his
age
but
after
long
years
of
hopeless
separation
he
were
again
brought
face
to
face
with
the
woman
who
had
been
the
one
passion
of
his
life
the
first
and
only
love
of
his
youth
and
what
if
she
were
still
then
exactly
as
he
had
last
seen
hershe
untouched
by
years
even
as
she
had
so
long
lived
in
his
thoughts
he
with
his
soul
scarred
and
seamed
by
many
encounters
bravely
sustained
in
the
battle
of
life
the
problem
thus
propounded
is
not
solvable
even
in
fiction
unless
it
be
by
fantastic
treatment
but
perhaps
the
more
so
on
this
account
did
it
haunt
me
and
out
of
the
travail
of
my
mind
around
it
out
of
the
changing
shadows
of
restless
speculation
gradually
emerged
clear
and
alive
the
being
of
adrian
landale
and
his
two
loves
here
then
was
a
man
whose
mind
moulded
by
nature
for
grace
and
contemplation
was
cast
by
fate
amid
all
the
turmoils
of
romance
and
action
here
was
one
of
those
whose
warm
heart
and
idealising
enthusiasm
must
wreathe
the
beauty
of
love
into
all
the
beauties
of
the
world
whose
ideals
are
spent
on
one
adored
object
who
having
lost
it
seems
to
have
lost
the
very
sense
of
love
to
whom
love
never
could
return
save
by
some
miracle
but
fortune
that
had
been
so
cruelly
hard
on
him
one
day
in
her
blind
way
brings
back
to
his
door
the
miraculous
restitutionand
there
leaves
him
to
struggle
along
the
new
path
of
his
fate
it
is
there
also
that
i
take
up
the
thread
of
the
speculation
and
watch
through
its
vicissitudes
the
working
of
the
problem
raised
by
such
a
strange
circumstance
the
surroundings
in
a
story
of
this

are
of
the

with
greater
improbability

indeed
where
is
now

writer

will
for
a
moment

even
tacitly
that
his
records
are

of
strong
action

analysis

a

the
uncertain
violence

the
outside

the

distance
of
time
appear
a
little
improbable
it
is
well
to
state
here
some
littleknown
facts
concerning
the
now
rather
incomprehensible
pursuit
of
gold
smugglinga
romantic
subject
if
ever
there
was
one
the
existence
at
one
time
of
this
form
of
freetrade
is
all
but
forgotten
indeed
very
little
was
ever
heard
of
it
in
the
world
except
among
parties
directly
interested
even
at
the
time
when
it
played
an
important
part
in
the
machinery
of
governments
its
rise
during
the
years
of
napoleonic
tyranny
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
its
continuance
during
the
factitious
calm
of
the
first
restoration
in
france
were
due
to
circumstances
that
never
existed
before
and
are
little
likely
to
occur
again
the
accumulation
of
a
fund
of
gold
coin
reserved
against
sudden
contingency
was
one
of
bonapartes
imperial
ideas
in
a
modified
and
more
modern
form
this
notion
of
a
warchest
untouched
and
unproductive
in
peacetime
is
still
adhered
to
by
the
germans
they
have
kept
to
heart
many
of
their
former
conquerors
lessons
lessons
forgotten
by
the
french
themselvesand
the
enormous
treasure
of
gold
bags
guarded
at
spandau
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
napoleon
however
in
his
triumphant
days
never
and
for
obvious
reasons
lacked
money
it
was
less
an
actual
treasure
that
he
required
and
valued
so
highly
for
political
and
military
purposes
than
an
ever
ready
reserve
of
wealth
easily
portable
of
paramount
value
at
all
times
concentrated
so
to
speak
and
nothing
could
come
nearer
to
that
description
than
rolls
of
english
guineas
indeed
the
vast
numbers
of
these
coins
which
fitfully
appeared
in
circulation
throughout
europe
justified
the
many
weird
legends
concerning
the
power
of
british
goldlor
anglais
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
in
days
when
the
national
currency
consisted
chiefly
of
lumbering
silver
cus
the
bourbon
government
also
appreciated
to
the
full
the
value
of
a
private
gold
reserve
at
any
rate
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
first
restoration
that
the
golden
guinea
of
england
found
in
france
its
highest
premium
without
going
into
the
vexed
and
dreary
question
of
single
or
double
standard
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
during
the
early
years
of
the
century
now
about
to
close
gold
coin
was
leaving
england
at
a
rate
which
not
only
appeared
phenomenal
but
was
held
to
be
injurious
to
the
community
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
it
was
finding
its
way
to
france
whilst
great
britain
was
flooded
with
silver
it
was
then
made
illegal
to
export
gold
coin
or
bullion
the
prohibition
was
stringently
indeed
at
one
time
ruthlessly
enforced
in
this
manner
the
new
and
highly
profitable
traffic
in
english
guineas
entered
the
province
of
the
freetrader
the
difference
introduced
in
his
practice
being
merely
one
of
degree
whereas
in
the
case
of
prohibited
imports
the
chief
task
lay
in
running
the
illicit
goods
and
distributing
them
in
the
case
of
guineasmuggling
its
arduousness
was
further
increased
by
the
danger
of
collecting
the
gold
inland
and
clearing
from
home
harbours
very
little
as
i
said
has
ever
been
heard
of
this
singular
trade
and
for
obvious
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
obtained
only
for
a
comparatively
small
number
of
years
the
latter
part
of
the
great
war
the
last
of
it
belonging
to
the
period
of
the
hundred
days
and
in
the
second
it
was
at
all
times
of
necessity
confined
to
a
very
small
number
of
freetrading
skippers
of
adventurous
men
in
stirring
days
there
were
of
course
a
multitude
but
few
naturally
were
the
men
to
whose
honour
the
custody
of
so
much
ready
wealth
could
safely
be
intrusted
that
is
where
as
captain
jack
says
sometimes
in
this
book
the
likes
of
me
come
in
the
exchange
was
enormously
profitable
as
much
as
thirtytwo
shillings
in
silver
value
could
at
one
time
be
obtained
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
for
an
english
guinea
but
the
shipper
and
broker
in
an
illegal
venture
where
contract
could
not
be
enforced
had
to
be
a
man
whose
simple
word
was
warrantyand
indeed
in
the
case
of
large
consignments
this
blind
trust
had
to
be
extended
to
almost
every
man
of
his
crew
what
a
romance
could
be
written
upon
this
theme
alone
in
the
story
of
adrian
landale
however
it
plays
but
a
subsidiary
part
brave
joyoushearted
captain
jack
and
his
bold
venture
for
a
fortune
appear
only
in
the
drama
to
turn
its
previous
course
to
unforeseen
channels
just
as
in
most
of
our
lives
the
sudden
intrusion
of
a
new
strong
personalitytransient
though
it
may
be
a
tempest
or
a
meteorchanges
their
seemingly
inevitable
trend
to
altogether
new
issues





it
was
urged
by
my
english
publishers
that
in
the
light
of
scarthey
i
relate
two
distinct
lovestories
and
two
distinct
phases
of
one
mans
life
and
that
it
were
wiser
by
which
word
i
presume
was
meant
more
profitable
to
distribute
the
tale
between
two
books
one
to
be
a
sequel
to
the
other
happily
i
would
not
be
persuaded
to
cut
a
fully
composed
canvas
in
two
for
the
sake
of
the
frames
it
is
the
fate
of
sequels
as
stevenson
said
in
his
dedication
of
catriona
to
disappoint
those
who
have
waited
for
them
besides
life
is
essentially
continuousit
may
not
be
inept
to
state
a
truism
of
this
kind
in
a
world
of
novels
where
the
climax
of
life
if
not
indeed
its
very
conclusion
is
held
to
be
reached
on
the
day
of
marriage
there
is
often
of
course
more
than
one
true
passion
of
love
in
a
mans
life
and
even
if
the
second
does
not
really
kill
the
memory
of
the
first
their
course
should
they
be
worth
the
telling
may
well
be
told
separately
but
if
in
the
story
of
a
mans
love
for
two
women
the
past
and
the
present
are
so
closely
interwoven
as
were
the
reality
and
the
mighthavebeen
in
the
mind
of
adrian
landale
any
separation
of
the
two
phases
youth
and
maturity
would
surely
have
stultified
the
whole
scheme
of
the
story
i
have
also
been
taken
to
task
by
some
critics
for
having
the
tale
once
opened
at
a
given
time
and
place
harked
back
to
other
days
and
other
scenes
an
inartistic
and
confusing
method
i
was
told
i
am
still
of
contrary
opinion
there
are
certain
stories
which
belong
by
their
very
essence
to
certain
places
all
ancient
buildings
have
if
we
only
knew
them
their
human
dramas
this
is
the
very
soul
of
the
hidden
but
irresistible
attraction
they
retain
for
us
even
when
deserted
and
dismantled
as
now
the
peel
of
scarthey
for
the
sake
of
harmonious
proportions
and
in
order
to
give
it
its
proper
atmosphere
it
was
imperative
that
in
this
dramawherever
the
intermediate
scenes
might
be
placed

on
the
banks
of
the

utterly
dismantled
it
is
not
even
now
all
ruin
and
at
the
time
when
sir
adrian
landale
of
pulwick
eighth
baronet
adopted
it
as
his
residence
it
was
far
from
being
such
true
the
greater
portion
of
that
medival
building
half
monastic
half
military
exposed
even
then
to
the
searching
winds
many

than

but
the
massive
square
keep
had
been
substantially
restored
although
roofless
its
upper
platform
was
as
firm
as
when
it
was
first
built
and
in
a
corner
solidly
ensconced
rose
the
more
modern
turret
that
sheltered
the
honest
warning
light
the
wide
chambers
of
the
two
remaining
floors
which
in
old
warlike
days
were
maintained
bare
and
free
and
lighted
only
by
narrow
watching
loopholes

been
pierced
into
the
enormous
thickness
of
stone
and
cement
the
bare
coldness
of
walls
was
also
hidden
under
more
homelike
panellings
closefitting
casements
and
solid
doors
insured
peace
within
the
wind
in
stormy
hours
might
moan
or
rage
outside
this
rocky
pile
might
hiss

its
wings
among
the
jagged
ruins
bellow
and
thunder
in

out
of
opened
vaults

it
might
not
rattle
a
window
of
the
modern
castellans
quarters

shake
a
latch
of
his
chamber
door
there
for
reasons
understood
then
only
by
himself
had
sir
adrian
elected
about
the
year
seven
of
this
century
and
in
the
prime
of
his
age
to
transplant
his
lares
and
penates
the
while
this
adrian
landales
ancestral
home
stood
in
its
placid
and
double
pride
of
ancient
and
settled
wealth
only
some
few
miles
away
as
the
bee
flies
in
the
midst
of
its
noble
park
slightly
retired
from
the
coastline
and
from
its
upper
casements
could
be
descried
by
day
the
little
green
patch
of
scarthey
and
the
jagged
outline
of
its
ruins
on
the
yellow
or
glimmering
face
of
the
great
bay
and
by
night
the
light
of
its
turret
and
there
he
was
still
living
in
some
kind
of
happiness
in
the
year
fourteen
when
out
of
the
eternal
store
of
events
began
to
shape
themselves
the
latter
episodes
of
a
life
in
which
storm
and
peace
followed
each
other
as
abruptly
as
in
the
very
atmosphere
that
he
then
breathed
for
some
eight
years
he
had
nested
on
that
rock
with
no
other
companions
but
a
dog
a
very
ancient
housekeeper
who
cooked
and
washed
for
t
young
mester
as
she
obstinately
persisted
in
calling
the
man
whom
she
had
once
nursed
upon
her
knee
and
a
singular
sturdy
foreign
man
ren
laptre
in
the
language
of
his
own
land
but
known
as
renny
potter
to
the
land
of
his
adoption
which
latter
was
more
than
suspected
of
having
escaped
from
the
liverpool
tower
at
that
time
the
lawful
place
of
custody
of
french
war
prisoners
his
own
voluntary
captivity
however
had
nothing
really
dismal
for
adrian
landale
and
the
inhabited
portions
of
scarthey
ruins
had
certainly
nothing
prisonlike
about
them
nothing
even
that
recalled
the
wilful
contrition
of
a
hermitage
on
the
second
floor
of
the
tower
the
first
being
allotted
to
the
use

and
private
of
the
small
household
clear
of
the
surrounding
walls
and
dismantled

sleeping
quarters

by
no

ascetically
furnished
opened
into
a
large
chamber

the
philosophic
lightkeeper
spent
the
best

of

were
broad
and

a
wide
view
of
the
bay
and
the
nearer
coast

other
to
the

the

on

a

and
the
mainland
the
sturdy
little
craft
heavily
laden
with
packages
was
being
hauled
up
to
its
usual
place
of
safety
high
on
the
shingle
bank
under
cover
of
a
remnant
of
walling
which
in
the
days
of
the
castles
strength
had
been
a
secure
landingplace
for
the
garrisons
boats
but
which
now
was
almost
filled
by
the
castup
sands
and
stone
of
the
beach
this
was
done
under
the
superintendence
of
ren
man
of
all
work
and
with
the
mechanical
intermediary
of
rollers
and
capstan
by
a
small
white
horse
shackled
to
a
lever
and
patiently
grinding
his
steady
rounds
on
the
sand
his
preliminary
task
achieved
the
man
after
a
few
friendly
smacks
set
the
beast
free
to
trot
back
to
his
loose
pasture
proceeding
himself
to
unship
his
cargo
through
the
narrow
frame
of
his
window
the
master
with
eyes
of
approval
could
see
the
servant
dexterously
load
himself
with
a
wellbalanced
pile
of
parcels
disappearing
to
return
after
intervals
emptyhanded
within
the
field
of
view
and
select
another
burden
now
heavier
now
more
bulky
in
due
course
ren
came
up
and
reported
himself
in
person
and
as
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
the
dark
doorway
framed
a
not
unstriking
presentment
a
younglooking
man
for
his
years
he
was
a
trifle
junior
to
his
master
short
and
sturdy
in
build
on
whose
very
broad
shoulders
sat
a
phenomenally
fair
headthe
hair
short
crisp
and
curly
in
colour
like
faded
towand
who
in
smilingly
respectful
silence
gazed
into
the
room
out
of
small
lightblue
eyes
brimful
of
alertness
and
intelligence
waiting
to
be
addressed
renny
said
adrian
landale
returning
the
glance
with
one
of
comfortable
friendliness
you
will
have
to
make
your
peace
with
margery
she
considers
that
you
neglect
me
shamefully
why
you
are
actually
twenty
minutes
late
after
three
days
journeying
and
perils
by
land
and
sea
the
frenchman
answered
the
pleasantry
by
a
broader
smile
and
a
scrape
and
your
honour
he
said
if
what
is
now
arriving
on
us
had
come
half
an
hour
sooner
i
should
have
rested
planted
there
with
a
jerk
of
the
flaxen
head
towards
the
mainland
turning
my
thumbs
till
tomorrow
at
the
least
we
shall
have
a
grain
number
one
soon
he
spoke
english
fluently
though
with
the
guttural
accent
of
brittany
and
an
unconquerable
tendency
to
translate
his
own
jargon
almost
word
for
word
in
their
daily
intercourse
master
and
man
had
come
for
many
years
past
to
eschew
french
almost
entirely
ren
had
let
it
be
understood
that
he
considered
his
proficiency
in
the
vernacular
quite
undeniable
and
with
characteristic
readiness
sir
adrian
had
fallen
in
with
the
little
vanity
in
former
days
the
dependants
form
of
address
had
been
monseigneur
considering
and
shrewdly
so
an
english
landowner
to
stand
in
that
relation
to
a
simple
individual
like
himself
in
later
days
monseigneur
having
demurred
at
the
appellation
my
lord
in
his
own
tongue
the
devoted
servant
had
discovered
your
honour
as
a
happy
substitute
and
adhered
to
this
discovery
with
satisfaction
oh
we
are
going
to
have
a
squall
say
you
interpreted
the
master
rising
to
inspect
the
weatherglass
which
in
truth
had
fallen
deep
with
much
suddenness
more
than
a
squall
i
think
this
looks
like
a
hurricane
coming
but
since
you
are
safe
home
alls
well
we
are
secure
and
sound
here
and
the
fishing
fleet
are
drawing
in
i
see
peering
through
the
seaward
window
and
now
continued
adrian
laying
down
his
napkin
and
brushing
away
a
few
crumbs
from
the
folds
of
a
faultless
silk
stock
what
have
you
for
me
thereand
what
news
news
your
honour
oh
for
that
i
have
news
this
time
said
mr
renny
potter
with
an
emphatic
nod
but
if
your
honour
will
permit
i
shall
say
them
last
i
have
brought
the
clothes
and
the
linen
the
wine
the
brandy
and
the
books
brandy
and
wine
your
honour
i
heard
out
of
the
last
prize
brought
into
liverpool
and
a
nantes
ship
it
was
toothis
in
a
pathetically
philosophical
tone
then
after
a
pause
also
provisions
and
bulbs
for
the
devils
pot
as
margery
will
call
it
but
there
is
no
saying
your
honour
eats
more
when
i
have
brought
him
back
onions
eschalot
and
ail
now
do
i
lie
your
honour
may
i
added
the
speaker
and
forthwith
took
his
answer
from
his
masters
smile
may
i
respectfully
see
what
the
old
one
has
kitchened
for
you
when
i
was
not
there
and
adrian
landale
with
some
amusement
watched
the
frenchman
rise
from
the
package
he
was
then
uncording
to
examine
the
platters
on
the
table
and
loudly
sniff

ah

sighed
the
man
returning
to
his
talk
you
others

are
big
and
strong
but
you
waste
great
things
in
small
enjoyment
oho
renny
said
the
lightkeeper
squire
as
he
leant
against
the
fireplace
leisurely
filling
a
long
clay
pipe
this
is
one
of
your
epigrams
i
must
make
a
note
of
it
anon
but
let
me
see
now
what
you
really
have
in
those
parcels
of
booksfor
books
they

not
so
carefully

the
man
undoing
the
final
fold
of
paper
mr
young
in
the
high
street
of
liverpool
had
the
packets
ready
he
says
you
must
have
them
all
and
all
printed
this
year
what
so
many
people
can
want
to
say
i
for
my
count
cannot
comprehend
three
more
parcels
on
the
stairs
your
honour
mr
young
says
you
must
have
them
but
it
took
two
porters
to
carry
them
to
the
preston
diligence
not
without
eagerness
did
the
recluse
of
scarthey
bend
over
and
finger
the
unequal
rows
of
volumes
arrayed
on
the
table
and
with
a
smile
of
expectation
examine
the
labels

ah

what

has
to

on
such

topic
dear

wordsworth
mused
sir
adrian
sitting
down
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
the
excursion
how
widely
have
our
lives
drifted
apart
since
those
college
days
of
ours
when
we
both
believed
in
the
coming
millennium
and
the
noble
future
of
mankindnoble
mankind
he
read
a
few
lines
and
became
absorbed
whilst
ren
noiselessly
busied
himself
in
and
out
of
the
chamber
presently
he
got
up
book
in
hand
slowly
walked
to
the
north
window
and
passively
gazed
at
the
misty
distance
where
rose
the
blue
outline
of
the
lake
hills
so
my
old
friend
almost
forgotten
he
murmured
that
is
where
you
indite
such
worthy
lines
it
were
enough
to
tempt
me
out
into
mens
world
again
to
think
that
there
would
be
many
readers
and
lovers
abroad
of
these
words
of
yours
so
that
is
what
five
and
twenty
years
have
done
for
youwhat
would
you
say
to
what
they
have
done
for
me
it
was
a
long
retrospect
sir
adrian
was
deeply
immersed
in
thought
when
he
became
aware
that
his
servant
had
come
to
a
standstill
as
if
waiting
for
a
return
of
attention
and
in
answer
to
the
mute
appeal
he
turned
his
head
once
more
in
rens
direction
your
honour
everything
is
in
its
place
began
the
latter
with
a
fitting
sense
of
his
own
method
i
have
now
to
report
that
i
saw
your
man
of
business
in
lancaster
and
he
has
attended
to
the
matter
of
the
brothers
shearmans
boat
that
was
lost
i
saw
the
young
men
themselves
this
morning
they
are
as
grateful
to
sir
adrian
as
people
in
this
country
can
express
this
last
with
a
certain
superiority
sir
adrian
received
the
announcement
of
the
working
of
one
of
his
usual
bounties
with
a
quiet
smile
of
gratification
they
also
told
me
to
say
that
they
would
bring
the
firewood
and
the
turf
tomorrow
but
they
wont
be
able
to
do
that
because
we
shall
have
dirty
weather
then
they
told
me
that
when
your
honour
wants
fish
they
begged
your
honour
to
run
up
a
white
flag
over
the
lanternthey
thought
that
a
beautiful
ideaand
they
would
bring
some
as
soon
as
possible
i
took
on
myself
to
assure
them
that
i
could
catch
what
fish
your
honour
requires
and
the
prawns
too

but
that
is
what
they
asked
me
to
say
well
well
and
so
you
can
said
the
master
amused
by
the
show
of
subacute
jealousy
what
else
the
books
of
the
man
of
business
and
the
banker
are
on
the
table
i
have
also
brought
gazettes
from
liverpool
here
the
fellows
countenance
brimmed
with
the
sense
of
his
news
importance
i
know
your
honour
cares
little
for
them
but
this
time
i
think
you
will
read
them
peace
your
honour
it
is
the
peace
it
is
all
explained
in
these
journalsthe
liverpool
mercury
renny
lifted
the
folded
sheets
from
the
table
and
handed
them
with
contained
glee
there
has
been
peace
these
six
months
and
we
never
knew
it
i
read
about
it
the
whole
way
back
from
the
town
the
emperor
is
shut
up
on
an
islandbut
not
so
willingly
as
your
honour
ah
noand
there
is
an
end
of
citizen
bonaparte
peace
france
and
england
no
longer
fighting
it
is
hard
to
believeand
our
old
kings
are
coming
back
and
everything
to
be
again
as
in
the
old
days
sir
adrian
took
the
papers
not
without
eagerness
and
glanced
over
the
narrative
of
events
already
months
old
with
all
the
surprise
of
one
who
having
wilfully
shut
himself
out
from
the
affairs
of
the
world
ignored
the
series
of
disasters
that
had
brought
about
the
tyrants
downfall
as
you
say
my
friend
it
is
almost
incredible
he
said
at
length
then
thoughtfully
and
now
you
will
be
wanting
to
return
home
said
he
ren
who
had
been
scanning
his
masters
face
with
high
expectation
felt
his
heart
leap
as
he
thought
he
perceived
a
hidden
tone
of
regret
in
the
question
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
short
height
and
with
a
very
decided
voice
made
answer
straightway
i
shall
go
away
from
your
honour
the
day
when
your
honour
dismisses
me
if
your
honour
decides
to
live
on
this
rock
till
my
hour
or
his
strikeson
this
rock
with
him
i
remain
i
am
not
conceited
i
hope
but
what
pray
will
become
of
your
honour
here
without
me
there
was
force
in
this
last
remark
simply
as
it
was
pronounced
through
the
mist
of
interlacing
thoughts
suggested
by
the
word
peace
the
end
of
the
revolution
that
distant
event
which
nevertheless
had
had
such
sweeping
influence
over
the
course
of
his
whole
life
it
brought
a
faint
smile
to
sir
adrians
lips
he
took
two
steps
forward
and
laid
his
hand
familiarly
on
the
mans
broad
shoulder
and
in
a
musing
way
he
said
at
intervals
yes
yes
indeed
good
renny
what
would
become
of
mewhat
would
have
become
of
mehow
long
ago
it
seemswithout
you
and
yet
it
might
have
been
as
well
if

periodic
fits
of

he
well
knew
their

in
a
troubled
way
he
looked
about

so
peaceful
so
retired

and
sir

understood
yes
yes
you
are
right
i
have
cut
off
the
old

he
made

he
was
pondering
over
the

disburdening
himself
of

another

item
of

he

in

dismiss
some
haunting
thought
turned
round
again
to

that
the

you

touched
the

listlessly
as
he
spoke
yet
instead
of
sitting
down

with

the

up
as
it
did
then
and
look
at
yonder

and
taking
the
man
by
the
arm
he
advanced
slowly
with
him
towards
the
window
in
the
west
the
heavens
on
the
horizon
had
grown
threateningly
dark
but
under
the
aweinspiring
slatecoloured
canopy
of

there
opened
a
broad
archway

with

known
to

through
which
charge
the

the
rushing
of
the
storm

already
visible
in
the
distance
over
the
grey
waters
which
having
been
swayed
for
days
by
a
steady
aquilon
were
now
lashed
in
flank
by
the
sudden
change
of

the
two
men
looked
out
for
a
while
in
silence
at
the
spectacle
of
the
coming
storm
in
the
servants
mind
ran
various
trivial
thoughts
bearing
on
the
presentwhat
a
lucky
matter
it
was
that
he
should
have
returned
in

only
just
in

it
was
from
the
angry
look
of
the
outer

the

now
for
many
a

be
besieged
by
seas
impassable
to
such
small
craft
as
alone
could
reach
the
reef
had
he
tarried
but
to
the
next
tide
and
how
sorely
he
had
been
tempted
to
remain
an
hour
more
in
the
gatekeepers

within

and
hearing
of
buxom

had
he
missed
the
tide
for
days
maybe
for
weeks
would
the
master
have
had
to
watch
and
tend
alone
the
beacon
fire
but
here
he
was
and
all
was
well
and
he
had
still
the
marvellous
news
to
tell
should
he
tell
them
now
no
the

no

living
in

of
those
venerable
colleges
on
the

very
atmosphere
of
which

seem
sufficient
to
glorify
the
merits
of
past
ages

such
peaceful

nevertheless
drifted
resistlessly
towards
that
unfathomable
sea
whither
a
love
for
the
abstract
beautiful
a
yearning
for
superearthly
harmony
and
justice
must
inevitably
waft
a
young

the
academical

glided
over
him
he
accumulated
much
classical

withal

much

developed
a
fine
youthful
theoretical

dipped
sthetically
into

he
found
a
dim
kind
of
help
towards
a
more
recondite
appreciation
of
the
beauties
of
nature
his
was
not
a
mind

delight
in
profound
knowledge
but
rather
in
intellectual
cream
he
solaced
himself
with
essays
that
would
have
been
voted
brilliant
had
they
dealt
with
things
less
extravagant
than

harmony
and
fraternal
happiness
with
verses
that
all
admitted
to
be
highly
polished
and
melodious
but
something
too
mystical
in
meaning
for
the
understanding
of
an
everyday
world
with
music
whereof

this
is
saying
that
adrian
landale
for
all
his
array
of
definite
accomplishments
which
might
have
been
a
neverfailing
source
of
interest
in
an
easy
existence
was
fitted
in
a
singularly
unfortunate
manner
for
the
life
into
which
one
sudden
turn
of
fortunes
wheel
unexpectedly
launched
him
during
the
short
halcyon
days
of
his
opening
independence
however
he
was
able
to
make
himself
the
centre
of
such
a
world
as
he
would
have
loved
to
live
in
he
was
not
of
course
generally
popular
either
at
college
or
at
home
nor
yet
in
town
except
among
that
small
set
in
whose
midst
he
inevitably
found
his
way
wherever
he
went
his
inferiors
in
social
status
perhaps
these
chosen
friends
of
his
but
their
lofty
enthusiasms
were
both
appreciative
of
and
congenial
to
his
own
most
of
them
indeed
came
in
afterlife
to
add
their
names
to
englands
roll
of
intellectual
fame
partly
because
they
had
that
in
them
which
adrian
loathed
as
unlovelythe
instinct
and
will
of
strife
partly
it
must
be
added
because
they
remained
free
in
their
circumstances
to
follow
the
lead
of
their
nature
which
freedom
was
not
allotted
to
him





on
one
magnificent
frosty
afternoon
early
in
the
year
1794
the
london
coach
deposited
adrian
landale
in
front
of
the
best
hostelry
in
lancaster
after
more
than
a
years
separation
from
his
family
this
separation
was
not
due
to
estrangement
but
rather
to
the
instigation
of
his
own
sire
sir
thomasa
gentleman
of
the
fine
old
schoolwho
exasperated
by
the
to
him
incomprehensible
and
insupportable
turn
of
mind
developed
by
his
heir
whom
he
loved
well
enough
notwithstanding
in
his
own
way
had
hoped
in
good
utilitarian
fashion
that
a
prolonged
period
of
contact
with
the
world
lubricated
by
a
plentiful
supply
of
money
might
shake
his
big
sawney
of

to

hearth
the
richer
for
a
few
gentlemanly

he
left
his
nonsense
behind
him
as
the
great
lumbering
vehicle
upon
the
box

of
which
sat
the
young
traveller

in
dreamy
speculation
according
to
his
wont
drew
clattering
to
a
halt
he
failed
at
first
to
notice
the
central
figure
in
the
midst
of
the
usual
expectant
crowd
of

guests
and
inn
retainers
called
forward
by
the
triumphant
trumpeting
which
heralds
the
approach
of
the
mail
there
however
stood
the
squire
of
pulwick
sir
tummus
himself
in
portly
and
jovial
importance
the
fathers
eyes
bright
and
piercing
under
his
bushy
white
brows
had
already
detected
his
boy
from
a
distance
and
they
twinkled
as
he
took
note
with
all
the
pride
of
an
author
in
his
work
of
the
symmetry
of
limb
and
shoulders
set
forth
by
the
youths
faultless
attireand
the
dress
of
men
in
the
old
years
of
the
century
was
indeed
calculated
to
display
a
figure
to
advantageof
the
lightness
and
grace
of
his
frame
as
he
dismounted
from
his
perch
in
short
of
the
increased
manliness
of
his
looks
and
bearing
but
a
transient
frown
soon
came
to
overshade
sir
thomass
ruddy
content
as
he
descried
the
deep
flush
an
old
weakness
which
mantled
the
young
cheeks
under
the
spur
of
unexpected
recognition
and
when
later
the
pair
emerged
from
the
inn
after
an
hours
conversation
over
a
bottle
of
burnt
sherryconversation
which
upon
the

side
had
borne
in

the

with
which
a
pair
of
highmettled
bays
were
impatiently
waiting
the
return
homewards
there
was
a
very
definite
look
of
mutual
dissatisfaction
to
be
read
upon
their
countenances
whiling
away
the
time
in
fitful
constrained
talk
parcelled
out
by
long
silences
they
drove
again
through
the
gorgeous
frostspeckled
scenery
of
rocky
lands
until
the
sheen
of
the
great
bay
suddenly
peered
between
two
distant
scars
proclaiming
the
approach
to
the
pulwick
estate
the
father
then
broke
a
long
spell
of
muteness
and
thus
to
his

country
tones

i
warn
you
in
tones
as
unconcerned
as
he
could
render
them
the
young
man
sought
to
turn
the
intercourse
to
less
personal
topics
by
inquiring
further
anent
this
unknown
cousin
whose
very
name
was
strange
to
him
sir
thomas
easily
placable
if
easily
roused
started
willingly
enough
on
a
congenial
topic
and
thus
adrian
conceived
his
first
impression
of
that
romantic
being
whose
deeds
have
remained
legendary
in
the
french
west
country
and
who
was
destined
to
exercise
so
strong
an
influence
upon
his
own
life
who
is

but
she
is
french
all
the

by

of
the
sort
which
would
reconcile
even
an
englishman
with
the
breed
sir
thomass
eyes
sparkled
with
enthusiasm
his
son
examined
him
with
grave
wonder
the
very
sight
of
her
my
boy
is
enough
to
make
a
mans
heart
warm
wait
till

she

a
look
of
polite
interest

is
even
now
fighting
the
republican
rapscallions
dn
them
and
thrashing
them
too
yonder
in
his
country
she
stuck
by
his
side
ay
like
a
good
plucked
one
she
did
until
it
became
palpable
that
if
there
was
to
be
a
son
and
heir
to
the
name
she
had
better
go
and
attend
to
its
coming
somewhere
else
in
peace
ho
ho
ho
well
england
was
the
safest
place
of
course
and
for
her
the
natural
one
she
came
and
offered
herself
to
us
on
the
plea
of
relationship
i
was
rather
taken
aback
at
first
i
own
but
gad
boy
when
i
saw
the
woman
after
hearing
what
she
had
had
to
go
through
to
reach
us
at
all
i
sang
another
song
well
she
is
a
fine
creaturefiner
than
ever
now
that
the
progeny
has
been
satisfactorily
hatched
a
brace
of
girls
instead
of
the
son
and
heir
after
all
two
of
them
no
less
ho
ho
ho
and
she
was
furious
the
pretty
dear
however
youll
soon
see
for
yourself
you
will
see
a
woman
sir
who
has
loaded
and
fired
cannon
with
her
own
hands
when
the
last
man
to
serve
it
had
been
shot
ay
and
more
than
that
my
ladshes
brained
a
hulking
sansculotte
that
was
about
to
pin
her
servant
to
the
floor
the
lad
has
told
me
so
himself
and
i
daresay
he
can
tell
you
more
if
you
care
to
practise
your
french
with
master
ren
laptre
thats
the
fellow
a
woman
who
sticks
to
her
lord
and
master
in
mud
and
powdersmoke
until
there
is
precious
little
time
to
spare
when
she
makes
straight
for
a
strange
land
in
a
fishingsmack
with
no
other
protector
than
a
peasant
and
now
with
an
imp
of
a
blackeyed
infant
to
her
breast
sally
mearsons
got
the
other
you
remember
sally
your
own
nurses
daughter
looks
like
a
chit
of
seventeen
thats
what
youll
see
sir
and
when
she
sails
downstairs
for
dinner
dressed
up
powdered
and
highheeled
she
might
be
a
princess
a
queen
who
has
never
felt
a
crumpled
roseleaf
in
her
life
gad
im
getting
poetical
i
declare
in
this
strain
did
the
squire
guiding
his
horses
with
strong
dexterous
hand
expatiate
to
his
son
the
crisp
air
rushing
past
them
making
their
faces
glow
with
the
tingling
blood
until
burning
the
ground
they
dashed
up
the
avenue
that
leads
to
the
white
mansion
of
pulwick
and
halted
amidst
a
cloud
of
steam
before
its
palladian
portico
what
happened
to
adrian
the
moment
after
happens
as
a
rule
only
once
in
a
mans
lifetime
through
the
opening
portals
the
guest
whose
condensed
biography
the
squire
had
been
imparting
to
his
son
all
unconsciously
eliciting
thereby
more
repulsion
than
admiration
in
the
breast
of
that
fastidious
young
misogynist
appeared
herself
to
welcome
the
return
of
her
host
adrian
as
he
retired
a
pace
to
let
his
father
ascend
the
steps
first
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
miraculously
small
and
arched
foot
clad
in
pink
silk
and
looking
suddenly
up
met
fully
the
flash
of
great
dark
eyes
set
in
a
small
white
face
more
brilliant
in
their
immense
blackness
than
even
the
glinting
icicles
pendant
over
the
lintel
that
now
shot
back
the
suns
sinking
glory
the
spell
was
of
the
kind
that
the
reason
of
man
can
never
sanction
and
yet
that
have
been
ever
and
will
be
while
man
is
this
youth
virgin
of
heart
dreamy
of
head
who
had
drifted
to
his
twentieth
year
all
unscathed
by
passion
or
desire
because
he
had
never
met
aught
in
flesh
and
blood
answering
to
his
unconscious
ideal
was
struck
to
the
depth
of
his
soul
by
the
presence
of
one
as
unlike
this
same
ideal
as
any
living
creature
could
be
struck
with
fantastic
suddenness
and
in
that
allencompassing
manner
which
seizes
the
innermost
fibres
of
the
being
it
was
a
pang
of
pain
but
a
revelation
of
glory
he
stood
for
some
moments
with
paling
cheeks
and
hotlybeating
heart
gazing
back
into
the
wondrous
eyes
she
yielding
her
cheek
carelessly
to
the
squires
hearty
kiss
examined
the
newcomer
curiously
the
while
whyhow
now
tut
tut
whats
this
thundered
the
father
who
following
the
direction
of
her
eyes
wheeled
round
suddenly
to
discover
his
sons
strange
bearing
have
you
lost
all
the
manners
as
well
as
the
notions
of
a
gentleman
these
last
two
years
speak
to
madame
de
savenaye
sirccile
this
is
my
son
pray
forgive
him
my
dear
the
fellows
shyness
before
ladies
is
inconceivable
it
makes
a
perfect
fool
of
him
as
you
see
but
madame
de
savenayes
finer
wits
had
already
perceived
something
different
from
the
ordinary
display
of
english
shyness
in
the
young
man
whose
eyes
remained
fixed
on
her
face
with
an
intentness
that
savoured
in
no
way
of
awkwardness
she
now
broke
the
spell
with
a
broader
smile
and
a
word
of
greeting
you
are
surprised
said
she
in
tripping
words
tinged
with
a
distinct
foreign
intonation
to
see
a
strange
face
here
mr
adrianor
shall
i
say
cousin
for
that
is
the
style
i
should
adopt
in
my
brittany
yes
you
see
in
me
a
poor
foreign
cousin
fleeing
for
protection
to
your
noble
country
how
do
you
do
my
cousin
she
extended
a
slender
white
hand
one
rosy
nail
of
which
bending
low
adrian
gravely
kissed
mais
comment
donc
exclaimed
the
lady
my
dear
uncle
did
you
chide
your
son
just
now
why
but
these
are
versailles
mannersso
gallant
so
courtly
and
she
gave
the
boys
fingers
as
they
lingered
under
hers
first
a
discreet
little
pressure
and
then
a
swift
flip
aside
ah
how
cold
you
are
she
exclaimed
and
then
laughing
added
sweetly
cold
hands
warm
heart
of
course
and
with
rapping
heels
she
turned
into
the
great
hall
and
into
the
drawingroom
whither
the
two
menthe
father
all
chuckles
and
the
son
still
struck
with
wonderfollowed
her
she
was
standing
by
the
hearth
holding
each
foot
alternately
to
the
great
logs
flaming
on
the
tiles
ever
and
anon
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
adrian
who
had
advanced
closer
without
selfconsciousness
but
still
in
silence
now
cousin
she
remarked
gaily
there
is
room
for
you
here
big
as
you
are
to
warm
yourself
you
must
be
cold
i
know
already
all
about
your
family
and
i
must
know
all
about
you
too
i
am
very
curious
i
find
them
all
such
good
kind
handsome
people
here
and
i
am
told
to
expect
in
you
something
quite
different
from
any
of
them
now
where
does
the
difference
come
in
you
are
as
tall
as
your
father
but
in
faceno
i
believe
it
is
your
pretty
sisters
you
are
like
in
face
here
the
squire
interrupted
with
his
loud
laugh
and
clapping
his
hand
on
his
stalwart
sons
head
you
have
just
hit
it
ccile
its
here
the
difference
lies
adrian
i
really
believe
is
a
little
mistake
of
dame
nature
his
brain
was
meant
for
a
girl
and
was
tacked
on
to
that
big
body
by
accident
ho
ho
ho
he
is
quite
ladylike
in
his
accomplishmentsloves
music
and
plays
by
gad
better
than
our
organist
writes
poetry
too
i
found
some
devilish
queer
things
on
his
writingtable
once
which
were
not
all
latin
verses
though
he
would
fain
i
thought
so
and
as
for
deportment
madame
ccile
why
there
is
more
propriety
in
that
hobbedehoy
at
least
more
blushing
in
him
than
in
all
the
breadandbutter
misses
in
the
county
adrian
said
nothing
but
when
not
turned
towards
the
ground
his
gaze
still
sought
the
countess
who
now
returned
the
look
with
a
ripening
smile
open
to
any
interpretation
surely
she
remarked
glancing
then
at
the
elder
for
an
instant
with
some
archness
surely
you
english
gentlemen
who
have
so
much
propriety
would
not
rather

there
was
young
mr
bradbury
we
heard
talked
of
yesterday
whom
every
farmer
with
a
redcheeked
lass
of
his
own
no
no
hastily
interrupted
the
baronet
with
a
blush
himself
while
adrians
cheek
in
spite
of
the
recent
indictment
preserved
its
smooth
pallorin
truth
the
boy
lost
in
his
first
lovedream
had
not
understood
the
allusion
no
i
dont
want
a
landale
to
be
a
blackguard
you
know
but
and
the
father
unable
to
split
this
ethical
hair
to
logical
satisfaction
stopped
and
entered
another
channel
of
grumbling
vituperation
whilst
the
countess
very
much
amused
by
her
private
thoughts
gave
a
little
rippling
laugh
and
resumed
her
indulgent
contemplation
of
the
accused
what
a
pity
now
schoolboy
rupert
is
not
the
eldest
there
would
be
a
country
gentleman
for
you
whereas
this
successor
that
is
to
be
of
mine
is
a
man
of
books
and
a
philosopher
forsooth
a
firstclass
bookworm
by
gad
i
believe
the
first
of
our
race
and
he
might
make
a
name
for
himself
ive
been
told
among
that
lot
though
the
pack
o
nonsense
he
treats
us
to
at
times
cannot
im
thinking
really
go
down
even
among
those
college
fuzzleheads
but
i
am
confounded
if
that
chap
will
ever
be
of
any
use
as
a
landlord
whenever
he
steps
into
my
shoes
he
hates
a
gun
and
takes
more
pleasurewhat
was
it
he
said
last
time
he
was
hereoh
yes
more
pleasure
in
watching
a
bird
dart
in
the
blue
than
bringing
it
down
be
it
never
so
neat
a
shot
ho
ho
did
ye
ever
hear
such
a
thing
and
though
he
can
sit
a
horsei
will
say
that
for
him
i
should
like
to
see
a
landale
that
could
noti
have
seen
this
big
boy
of
mine
positively
sicken
ay
and
scandalise
the
hunt
by
riding
away
from
the
death
moreover
i
believe
that
when
i
am
gone
he
will
always
let
off
any
poaching
scoundrel
on
the
plea
that
the
vermin
only
take
for
their
necessity
what
we
preserve
for
sport
the
little
foreign
lady
smiling
no
longer
eyed
her
big
cousin
with
wondering
looks
strange
indeed
she
remarked
that
a
man
should
fail
to
appreciate
the
boon
of
mans
existence
the
strength
and
freedom
to
dominate
to
be
up
and
doing
to
live
in
fact
how
i
should
long
to
be
a
man
myself
if
i
ever
allowed
myself
to
long
for
anything
but
i
am
a
woman
as
you
see
she
added
rising
to
the
full
height
of
her
exquisite
figure
and
must
submit
to
womans
lotand
that
is
just
now
to
the
point
for
i
must
leave
you
to
go
and
see
to
the
wants
of
that
mioche
of
mine
which
i
hear
whining
upstairs
but
i
do
not
believe
my
uncles
account
of
you
is
a
complete
picture
after
all
cousin
adrian
i
shall
get
it
out
of
you
anon
catechise
you
in
my
own
way
and
if
needs
be
convert
you
to
a
proper
sense
of
the
glorious
privileges
of
your
sex
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
well
my
lad
said
sir
thomas
that
evening
when
the
ladies
had
left
the
two
men
to
their
decanter
i
thought
my
frenchwoman
would
wake
you
up
but
by
george
i
hardly
expected
she
would
knock
you
all
of
a
heap
so
quick
hey
youre
winged
adrian
winged
or
this
is
not
port
i
cannot
say
sir
answered
adrian
musing
the
old
man
caught
up
the
unsatisfactory
reply
in
an
exasperated
burlesque
of
mimicry
i
cannot
say
siryou
cannot
say
pooh
pooh
there
is
no
shame
in
being
in
love
with
her
we
all
are
more
or
less
pass
the
bottle
as
for
you
since
you
clapped
eyes
on
her
you
have
been
like
a
man
in
the
moon
not
a
word
to
throw
to
a
dog
no
eyes
no
ears
but
for
your
own
thoughts
so
long
as
madam
is
not
there
enter
madam
youre
alive
again
by
george
and
pretty
lively
too
gad
i
never
thought
id
ever
see
you
do
the
ladys
man
all
in
your
own
queer
way
of
course
but
hang
it
all
she
seems
to
like
it
the
little
minx
ay
and
if
she
has
plenty
of
smiles
for
the
old
man
shes
ready
to
give
her
earnest
to
youi
saw
her
i
saw
her
but
dont
you
forget
shes
married
sir
very
much
married
too
she
dont
forget
it
either
i
can
tell
you
though
you
may
think
she
does
now
what
sort
of
game
is
she
making
of
you
what
were
you
talking
about
in
the
picture
gallery
for
an
hour
before
dinner
eh
to
say
the
truth
answered
the
son
simply
it
was
about
myself
almost
the
whole
time
and
she
flattered
you
finely
ill
be
bound
of
course
said
his
elder
with
a
knowing
look
oh
these
women
these
women
on
the
contrary
sir
she
thinks
even
less
of
me
than
you
do
that
woman
has
the
soul
of
a
savage
we
have
not
one
thought
in
common
the
father
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
a
pretty
savage
to
look
at
anyhow
a
wellpolished
one
in
the
bargain
ho
ho
ho
well
well
i
must
make
up
my
mind
i
suppose
that
my
eldest
son
is
a
lunatic
in
love
with
a
savage
adrian
remained
silent
for
a
while
toying
with
his
glass
his
young
brow
contracted
under
a
painful
frown
at
length
checking
a
sigh
he
answered
with
deliberation
since
it
is
so
palpable
to
others
i
suppose
it
must
be
love
as
you
say
i
had
thought
hitherto
that
love
of
which
people
talk
so
much
was
a
feeling
of
sweetness
what
i
feel
in
this
ladys
presence
is
much
more
kin
to
anguish
for
all
that
as
you
have
noticed
i
appear
to
live
only
when
she
is
nigh
the
father
looked
at
his
son
and
gaped
the
latter
went
on
after
another
pause
i
suppose
it
is
so
and
may
as
well
own
it
to
myself
and
to
you
though
nothing
can
come
of
it
good
or
bad
she
is
married
and
she
is
your
guest
and
even
if
any
thought
concerning
me
could
enter
her
heart
the
merest
show
of
love
on
my
part
would
be
an
insult
to
her
and
treason
to
you
but
trust
me
i
shall
now
be
on
my
guard
since
my
behaviour
has
already
appeared
strange
tut
tut
said
the
baronet
turning
to
his
wine
in
some
dudgeon
his
rubicund
face
clouding
as
he
looked
with
disfavour
at
this
strange
heir
of
his
who
could
not
even
fall
in
love
like
the
rest
of
his
race
what
are
you
talking
about
come
get
out
of
that
and
see
what
the
little
ladys
about
and
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
shell
not
compromise
herself
with
a
zany
like
you
anyhow
that
ill
warrant
but
adrian
with
all
the
earnestness
of
his
nature
and
his
very
young
fears
was
strenuously
resolved
to
watch
himself
narrowly
in
his
intercourse
with
his
too
fascinating
relative
little
recking
how
infinitesimal
is
the
power
of
a
mans
freewill
upon
the
conduct
of
his
life
the
next
morning
found
the
little
countess
in
the
highest
spirits
particularly
good
news
had
arrived
from
her
land
with
the
early
courier
true
the
news
were
more
than
ten
days
old
but
she
had
that
insuperable
buoyancy
of
hopefulness
which
attends
active
and
healthy
natures
the
breton
peasants
she
explained
to
the
company
round
the
breakfast
table
headed
by
their
lords
among
whom
was
her
own
seigneur
et
matre
had
again
crushed
the
swarms
of
ragged
brigands
that
called
themselves
soldiers
from
all
accounts
there
was
no
hope
for
the
latter
their
atrocities
had
been
such
that
the
whole
land
from
normandy
to
guyenne
was
now
in
arms
against
them
and
in
paris
the
hot
pit
whence
had
issued
the
storm
of
foulness
that
blasted
the
fair
kingdom
of
france
after
laying
low
the
hallowed
heads
of
a
good
king
and
a
beautiful
queen

off

lofty
patriots
hein
beau
cousin
for
whom
it
seems
you
have
an
admiration
commented
the
lady
interrupting
her
account
to
sip
her
cup
of
cream
and
chocolate
with
a
little
finger
daintily
cocked
and
shoot
a
mocking
shaft
at
the
young
philosopher
from
the
depth
of
her
black
eyes
like
demented
wolves
they
are
destroying
each
otherpray
the
god
of
justice
quoted
she
from
her
husbands
letter
that
it
may
only
last
in
a
few
months
then
there
will
be
none
of
them
left
and
the
people
relieved
from
this
rule
of
blood
will
all
clamour
for
the
true
order
of
things
and
the
poor
country
may
again
know
peace
and
happiness
meanwhile
all
has
yet
to
be
won
by
much
devotion
and
selfsacrifice
in
the
cause
of
god
and
king
and
afterwards
will
come
the
reward
and
the
revenge
added
madame
de
savenaye
with
a
little
fierce
laugh
folding
the
sanguine
budget
of
news
oh
they
must
leave
us
a
few
for
revenge
how
we
shall
make
the
hounds
smart
when
the
king
returns
to
his
own
and
then
for
pleasures
and
for
life
again
and
we
may
yet
meet
at
the
mansion
of
savenaye
in
paris
she
went
on
gaily
my
good
uncle
and
fair
cousins
for
the
king
cannot
fail
to
recall
his
faithful
supporter
and
there
will
be
feasts
and
balls
and
there
maybe
we
shall
be
able
to
repay
in
part
some
of
your
kindness
and
hospitality
and
you
cousin
adrian
you
will
have
to
take
me
through
pavanne
and
gavotte
and

shall

proud
of

cavalier

admiration
serious
enough
in

in

there
was
little
doubt
with
sombre
heart
he

not

to

youth
struggled
with
a
ghastly
smile
and
the
father
laughed
outright
but
madame

checked
herself
into
gravity
once

and
relinquished

we
have
still
to
fight
for
it
oh
that
i
were
free
to
be
up
and
doing
the
impatient
exclamation
was
wrung
out
of
her
apparently
by
the
appearance
of
two
nurses
each
bearing
an
infant
in
long
white
robes
for

preliminary
to

of

much
occupied
with
her
new
duties
of
attendant
to

cried
in

lancastrian
dandling
her
bundle
energetically
from
side
to
side
in
the
excess
of
her
admiration
and
added
with
a
laugh
of
tender
delight
eh
but
youre
my
own
lad
still
as
how
tis
when
blushing
the
young
man
crossed
the
room
and
stooped
to
kiss
her
glancing
shyly
the
while
at
the
white
bundle
in
her
arms
well
and
how
are
the
little
ones
quoth
madame

swinging
her
dainty
person
up
to
the

halting
by
beaming

both
the
nurses
blushed
margery
at
the
soft
impeachment
as
she
delivered
over
the
minute
burden
her
daughter
in
honest
indignation
at
the
insulting
want
of
interest
shown
for

the

addressing
herself
to
the
unconscious
little
being

she
took
it
in
her
arms

belying
her
words
by
the
grace
and
instinctive
maternal
expertness
with
which
she
handled

soothed

sharpness

had
been
surveying
the
scene
from
the
hearthrug
chuckling
in
benevolent
amusement
at
little
madams
ways
yes
it
was
her
intention
to
return
to
her
place

the
side
of
her

she
explained
halting
in
her
walk
to
face
him
gravely
she
had
come
to
that
resolution
no
doubt
her
uncle
would
take
the
children
under
his
care

he
again
in
rueful
tones

what

you
could
doeh
but
here
recollecting
himself
he
hesitated
and
started
upon
a
more
plausible
line
of
expostulation
pooh
pooh

cant
leave
the
little
ones
your

does
not
ask
you
to
come

leave
them
does
he
in
any
case
with

authority
i

not

she
looked
up
with
a
smile
would
you
allow
your
friends
to
continue
fighting
alone
for
all
you
love
because
you
happened
to
be
in
safe
and
pleasant
circumstances

asked
then
she
added
ingenuously
i
have
heard
you
say
of
one
that
was
strong
of
will
and
staunch
to
his

to
see
their

remain
among
them
sharing
their

of
their

gazing

its

with
wistful

my

sir
thomas
with
an
inarticulate
growl
relapsed
into
silence
and
she
resumed
her
walk
with
bent
head
lost
in
thought
up
and
down
the
great
room
out
of
the
pale
winter
sunshine
into
the
shadow
and
back
again
to
the
tune
of

she
hummed
beneath
her
breath
while
the

in
its
white
cap
from
which
protruded
one
tiny
straight
wisp
of

hair
with
its
beady
unseeing
black
eyes
and
its
round
mouth
dribbling
peacefully
bobbed
over
her
shoulder
as
she
went
adrian
stood
in
silence
too
following
her
with
his
eyes
while
the
picture
so
sweet
to
see
so
strange
to
one
who
knew
all
that
was
brewing
in

head
and

stamped
itself
upon
his
brain
at
the

she
halted
a
moment
and
looked
at
them
both
yes
my

she
said
and
her

shot

a
fair
emissary
many
guests
had
been
convened
to
the
hospitable
board
of
pulwick
upon
the
evening
which
followed
adrians
return
home
and
as
besides
the
fact
that
the
fame
of
the
french
lady
had
spread
enthusiasm
in
most
of
the
male
breasts
of
the
district
and
anxious
curiosity
in
gentler
bosoms
there
was
a
natural
neighbourly
desire
to
criticise
the
young
heir
of
the
house
after
his
years
absence
the
county
had
responded
in
a
body
to
the
invitation
it
was
a
goodly
company
therefore
that
was
assembled
in
the
great
withdrawing
rooms
when
the
countess
herself
came
tripping
down
the
shallow
oaken
stairs
and
found
adrian
waiting
for
her
in
the
hall
he
glanced
up
as
she
descended
towards
him
to
cover
her
with
an
ardent
look
and
feast
his
eyes
despairingly
on
her
beauty
and
she
halted
a
moment
to
return
his
gaze
with
a
light
but
meaning
air
of
chiding
cousin
she
said
you
have
very
singular
manners
for
one
supposed
to
be
so
shy
with
ladies
do
you
know
that
if
my
husband
were
here
to
notice
them
you
might
be
taken
to
task
adrian
ran
up
the
steps
to
meet
her
the
man
in
him
was
growing
apace
with
the
growth
of
a
mans
passion
and
by
the
boldness
of
his
answer
belying
all
his
recent
wise
resolutions
he
now
astonished
himself
even
more
than
her
you
are
going
back
to
him
he
said
with
halting
voice
all
is
wellfor
him
perhaps
for
you
for
us
who
remain
behind
there
is
nothing
left
but
the
bitterness
of
regretand
envy
then
in
silence
they
descended
together
as
they
were
crossing
the
hall

entered
suddenly
to
them

as
he
went

young
breton

the
lord
of

had
appointed
as
squire
to
his
lady
upon
her
travels
and
who
since
her
establishment
at
pulwick
had
been
sent
to
carry
news

money
back
to

on
his
haggard
countenance

of

import

tears
had
blurred
his
sunburnt
cheek
and
the
hand
that
tore
the
hat
from
his
head
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
his
mistress
partly
in
instinctive
humility
partly
it
seemed
to
conceal
some
papers
he
held
against
his
breast
twitched
with
nervous
anguish

around
like
a
hunted
animal
seeking
a
retreat
and
then
up
at
her
in
dumb
pleading
but
she
stamped
her
foot
and
held

to

the
imperiousness

repeated

drew

shook

raised
tones
and
uneasy
at
her
nonappearance
opened
the
drawingroom

and
came
forward
anxiously
whilst
his
assembled
guests
among
whom
a
sense
that
something
of
importance
was
passing
had
rapidly

curiously
about

ah
i
knew
it
my
andr

the

of

loyal
a
sigh
lifted
the
fair
young
bosom
but
she
showed
no
other
sign
of
weakness
indeed
those
who
watched
this
unexpected
scene
were
struck
by
the
contrast
between
the
bearing
of
this
young
almost
girlish
creature
who
holding
the
written
sheets
with
firm
hands
to
the
light
read
their
terrible
contents
with
dry
eyes
and
that
of
the
man
who
had
sunk
kneeling
at
her
feet
all
undone
to
have
had
the
bringing
of
the
news
the
silence
was
profound
save
for
the
crackling
of
the
pages
as
she
turned
them
over
and
an
occasional
longdrawn
sob
from
the
messenger
when
she
came
to
the
end

was

some
moments
absorbed
in
thought
absently
refolding
the
letter
into
its
original
neatness
then
her
eyes
fell
on
rens
prostrate
figure
and
she
stooped
to
lay
a
kind
hand
for
an
instant
on
his
shoulder

up
my
good

she
said
at
her
voice
and
touch

dragged
his
limbs
together
and

he
lifted
his
bloodshot
eyes
to
her
with
the
gaze
of
a
faithful
dog
in
distress
scraped
an
uncouth
bow
and
abruptly
turned
away
brushing
the
tears
from
his
cheek
with
his
sleeve
and
hurrying
to
relieve
his
choking
grief
in
solitude
she
stood
a
while
again
absorbed
in
her
own
reflection
and
of
those
who
would
have
rushed
to
speak
gentle
words
to
her
and
uphold
her
with
tender
hands
had
she
wept
or
swooned
there
was
none
who
dared
approach
this
grief
that
gave
no
sign
in
a
short
time
however
she
seemed
to
recollect
herself
and
awaken
to
the
consciousness
of
the

uncle
she
said
going
up
to
the
old
man
and
kissing
his
cheek
after
sweeping
the
assembled
company
with
dark
thoughtful
gaze
here
are
news
that
i
should
have
expected

that
i
would

death
she
said
with
a
gleam
of
exaltation
in
her
eyes
then
added
after
a
pause
between
clenched
teeth
almost
in
a
whisper
and
my
sister
tooshe

i
will
tell
you

now
jovial
sir
thomas
greatly
discomposed
and
fairly
at
a
loss
how
to
deal
with
the
stricken
woman
who
was
so
unlike
any
womankind
he
had
ever
yet
come
across
patted
her
hand
in
silence
placed
it
within
his
arm
and
quietly
led
her
into
the
drawingroom
rolling
as
he
did
so
uneasy
eyes
upon
his
guests
but
she
followed
the
current
of
her
thoughts
as
her
little
feet
kept
pace
beside
him
that
is
badbut
worsethe
worst
of
all
the
cause
of
god
and
king
is
again
crushed
everything
to
begin
afresh
but
for
the
present
wehere
she
looked
round
the
room
and
her
eyes
rested
an
instant
upon
a
group
of
young
men
who
were
surveying
her
from
a
corner
with
mingled
admiration
and
awewe
that
is
ren
and
i
have
work
to
do
in
this
country
before
we
return
for
you
will
keep
us
a
little
longer
she
added
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
will
i
keep
you
a
little
longer
exclaimed
the
squire
hotly
will
i
ever
let
you
go
now
she
shook
her
head
at
him
with
something
of
her
natural
archness
then
turning
to
make
a
grave
curtsey
to
the
circle
of
ladies
around
her
i
and
my
misfortune
she
said
have
kept
your
company
and
your
dinner
waiting
i
hardly
know
how
long
no
doubt
in
their
kindness
they
will
forgive
me

arm
which
delighted
at
the
solution
of
the
present
difficulty
and
nodding
to
adrian
to
start
the
other
guests
he
hastened
to
offer
her
she
preceded
the
rest
into
the
dininghall
with
her
usual
alert
bearing
the
behaviour
of
the
countess
of
savenaye
had
affected
the
various
spectators
in
various
ways
the
male
sex
to
a
man
extolled
her
fortitude
the
ladies
however
condemned
such
unfeminine
strength
of
mind
while
the
more
charitable
prophesied
that
she
would
pay
dearly
for
this
unnatural
repression
and
the
whispered
remark
of
one
of
the
prettier
and
younger
damsels
that
the
loss
of
a
husband
did
not
seem
to
crush
her
at
any
rate
met
on
the
whole
with
covert
approval
as
for
adrian
who
shall
describe
the
tumult
of
his
soulthe
regret
the
hungering
over
her
in
her
sorrow
the
wild
unbidden
hopes
and
his
shame
of
them
careful
of
what
his
burning
eyes
might
reveal
he
hardly
dared
raise
them
from
the
ground
and
yet
to
keep
them
long
from
her
face
was
an
utter
impossibility
the
whispered
comments
of
the
young
men
behind
him
their
admiration
and
astonishment
drove
him
to
desperation
and
the
highnosed
dowager
whom
it
was
his
privilege
to
escort
to
his
fathers
table
arose
from
it

that
sir
thomass
heir
had
lost
in
his
travels
the
few
poor
wits
he
ever
possessed
the
dinner
that
evening
was
without
doubt
the
most
dismal
meal
the
neighbourhood
had
ever
sat
down
to
at
the
hospitable
board
of
pulwick
past
funeral
refections
not
excepted
the
host
quite
taken
up
with
his
little
foreign
relative
had
words
only
for
her
and
these
indeed
consisted
merely
in
fruitless
attempts
to
induce
her
to
partake
largely
of
every
courseremoves
relieves
sidedishes
joints
as
their
separate
turn
came
round
long
spells
of
silence
fell
upon
him
meantime
which
he
emphasised
by
lugubriously
clearing
his
throat
except
for
the
pretty
courtesy
with
which
she
would
answer
him
she
remained
lost
in
her
own
thoughtsever
and
anon
consulting
the
letter
which
lay
beside
her
to
fall
again
it
seemed
into
a
deeper
muse
but
never
a
tear
glinted
between
her
black
lashes
more
than
once
adrian
from
his
distant
end
of
the
table
met
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
for
a
moment
and
the
look
so
full
of
mysterious
meanings
made
his
heart
beat
in
anguish
expecting
he
knew
not
what
among
the
rest
of
the
assembly
part
deference
to
a
calamity
so
stoutly
borne
part
amazement
at
such
strange
ways
part
discomfort
at
their
positions
as
feasters
in
the
midst
of
mourning
had
reduced
conversation
to
the
merest
pretence
the
ladies
were
glad
enough
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
withdraw
nor
did
most
of
the
men
view
with
reluctance
a
moment
which
would
send
the
decanters
gliding
freely
over
the
mahogany
and
relieve
them
from
this
unwonted
restraint
madame
de
savenaye
had
however
other
interests
in
store
for
these
latter
she
rose
with
the
rest
of
the
ladies
but
halted
at
the
door
and
laying
her
hand
upon
her
uncles
arm
said
an
earnest
word
in
his
ear
in
obedience
to
which
he
bundled
out
his
daughters
as
they
hung
back
politely
closed
the
door
upon
the
last
skirt
and
reconducted
the
countess
to
the
head
of
the
table
scratching
his
chin
in
some
perplexity
but
ready
to
humour
her
slightest
whim
she
stood
at
her
former
place
and
looked
for
a
moment
in
silence
from
one
to
another
of
the
faces
turned
with
different
expressions
of
astonishment
and
anticipation
towards
herruddy
faces
most
of
them
young
or
old
handsome
or
homely
the
honest
english
stamp
upon
each
and
distinct
from
them
all
adrians
pallid
thoughtful
features
and
his
ardent
eyes
upon
him
her
gaze
rested
the
longest
then
with
a
little
wave
of
her
hand
she
prayed
them
to
be
seated
and
waited
to
begin
her
say
until
the
wine
had
passed
round
gentlemen
then
quoth
she
with
my
good
uncles
permission
i
shall
read
you
the
letter
which
i
have
this
night
received
so
that
english
gentlemen
may
learn
how
those
who
are
faithful
to
their
god
and
their
king
are
being
dealt
with
in
my
country
this
letter
is
from
monsieur
de
puisaye
one
of
the
most
active
partisans
of
the
royal
cause
a
connection
of
the
ancient
house
of
savenaye
and
he
begins
by
telling
me
of
the
unexpected
reverses
sustained
by
our
men
so
close
upon
their
successes
at
chateaugonthier
successes
that
had
raised
our
loyal
hopes
so
high
the
most
crushing
defeat
he
writes
has
taken
place
near
the
town
of
savenaye
itself
on
your
own
estate
and
your
historic
house
is
now
alas
in
ruins
during
the
last
obstinate
fight
your
husband
had
been
wounded
but
after
performing
prodigies
of
valoursuch
as
it
was
hoped
or
trusted
the
king
should
in
time
hear
ofhe
escaped
from
the
hands
of
his
enemies
for
many
weeks
with
a
few
hundred
followers
he
held
the
fields
in
the
marais
but
he
was
at
last
hemmed
in
and
captured
by
one
of
the
monster
thureaus
colonnes
infernales
those
hellish
legions
with
an
account
of
whose
deeds
so
says
this
gallant
gentleman
our
friend
i
will
not
defile
my
pen
but
whose
boasts
are
like
those
of
attila
the
hun
and
who
in
their
malice
have
invented
obscene
tortures
worthy
of
iroquois
savages
for
all
who
fall
into
their
clutches
be
they
men
women
or
children
but
by
heavens
mercy
dear
madame
says
m
de
puisaye
to
me
your
noble
husband
was
too
weak
to
afford
sport
to
those
demons
and
so
he
has
escaped
torment
he
was
hanged
with
all
speed
indeed
for
fear
he
might
die
first
of
his
toils
and
his
wounds
and
so
defeat
them
at
the
last
a
rustling
murmur
of
horror
and
indignation
went
round
the
table
but
the
little
woman
faced
the
audience
proudly
he
died
she
said
as
beseems
a
brave
man
but
this
is
not
all
i
had
a
sister
she
was
very
fairlike
me
some
people
said
in
looksshe
used
to
be
the
merry
one
at
home
in
the
days
of
peace
she
gave
a
little
smile
far
more
piteous
than
tears
would
beshe
chose
to
remain
among
her
people
when
they
were
fighting
to
help
the
wounded
the
sick
here
madame
de
savenaye
paused
a
moment
and
put
down
the
letter
from
which
she
had
been
reading
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
begun
to
speak
she
grew
pale
knitting
her
black
brows
and
with
downcast
eyes
she
went
on
monsieur
de
puisaye
says
he
asks
my
pardon
humbly
on
his
knees
for
writing
such
tidings
to
me
bereaved
as
i
am
of
all
i
hold
dear
but
it
is
meet
he
says
that
the
civilised
world
should
know
the
deeds
these
followers
of
liberty
and
enlightenment
have
wrought
upon
gallant
men
and
highborn
ladies
and
i
hold
that
he
says
well
she
flashed
once
more
her
black
gaze
round
upon
the
men
who
with
heads
all
turned
towards
her
and
forgetting
their
wine
hung
upon
her
words
it
is
right
that
i
should
know
and
you
too
it
is
meet
that
such
deeds
should
be
made
known
to
the
world
my
sister
was
taken
by
these
men
but
less
fortunate
than
my
husband
she
had
life
enough
left
for
tortureshe
too
is
dead
now
m
de
puisaye
adds
thank
god
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
say
toothank
god
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
as
she
ceased
speaking
broken
at
last
here
and
there
along
the
table
by
exclamations
and
groans
and
a
deep
execration
from
sir
thomas
which
was
echoed
deepmouthed
by
his
guests
adrian
himself
the
pacific
the
philosopher
with
both
arms
stretched
out
on
the
table
clenched
his
hands
and
set
his
teeth
and
gazed
into
space
with
murderous
looks
then
the
clear
young
voice
went
on
again
you
who
have
honoured
mothers
and
wives

how
long
will
you

such
things
to
be
done
while
you
have
arms
to
strike
we
are
not
beaten
yet
there
are
french
hearts
still
left
that
will
be
up
and
doing
so
long
as
they
have
a
drop
of
blood
to
shed

gallant
bretons

any
of

here
who
will
help
the
widow
to
maintain
the
fight
she
had
risen
to
her
feet
the
blood
glowed
on
her
cheek
as
she
concluded
her
appeal
a
thousand
stars
danced
in
her
eyes
old
men
and
young
they
leapt
up
with
a
roar
pressing
round
her
pouring
forth
acclamations

rung
to
such
enthusiasm

when
with
proud
smiles
and
crimsoned
face
she
withdraws
at
last
from
so
much
ardour
the
door
has
scarcely
fallen
behind
her
before
sir
thomas
proposes
her
health
in
a
bellow
that
trembles
upon
tears
gentlemen
this

such
as

put
most

strength
to
shame
here

to
madame

halting
on

stairs
for
a
moment

her
highbeating
heart
before
she
lay

babe
against

the
toast
honoured
with
three
times
three





when
the
lancastrian
ladies
had
succeeded
at
length
in
collecting
and
carrying
off
such
among
the
hiccupping
husbands
and
maudlin
sons
who
were
able
to
move
sir
thomas
reentering
the
hall
after
speeding
the
last
departing
chariot
and
prudently
leaning
upon
his
tall
sonfor
though
he
had
a
seasoned
head
the
nights
potations
had
been
deep
and
fierywas
startled
wellnigh
into
soberness
at
the
sight
of
his
niece
waiting
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
why
cis
my
love
we
thought
you
had
been
in
bed
this
long
while
whywhere
have
you
been
then
since
you
ran
away
from
the
diningroom
by
george
chuckling
the
fellows
were
mad
to
get
another
glimpse
of
you
his
bloodshot
eye
hung
over
her
fondly
there
was
not
a
trace
of
fatigue
upon
that
delicate
pretty
face
i
wanted
to
thinki
have
much
to
think
on
now
i
have
had
to
read
and
ponder
upon
my
instructions
heretapping
her
teeth
with
the
letter
she
still
carried
good
uncle
i
would
speak
with
youyes
even
now
quick
to
notice
adrians
slight
frown
of
disapproval
poor
fellow
he
was
sober
enough
at
any
rate
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
i
have
my
work
to
do
and
i
shall
not
rest
tonight
till
i
have
planned
it
in
my
head
surely
the
brilliancy
of
those
eyes
was
feverish
the
little
hands
she
laid
upon
them
to
draw
them
into
the
dimlit
library
were
hot
as
fire
why
yes
my
pretty
quoth
the
good
uncle
stifling
a
portentous
yawn
and
striving
to
look
wondrous
wise
adrian
she
wants
to
consult
me
sir
hic
he
fell
into
an
armchair
as
he
spoke
and
she
sank
on
her
knees
beside
him
the
firelight
playing
upon
her
eager
face
while
adrian
in
the
shadow
watched
do
you
think
she
asked
of
the
old
man
eagerly
that
these
gentlemen
who
spoke
so
kindly
to
me
a
few
hours
ago
will
be
as
much
in
earnest
in
the
morning
why
dn
them
if
they
go
back
on
their
word
ill
call
them
out
thundered
sir
thomas
in
a
great
rage
all
of
a
sudden
she
surveyed
him
inquiringly
and
shot
a
swift
keen
glance
from
the
placid
bulky
figure
in
the
chair
to
adrian
pale
and
erect
behind
it
then
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
a
few
paces
off
as
it
were
pondering
what
is
now
required
of
mei
have
been
thinking
it
well
over
she
said
at
last
can
hardly
be
achieved
by
a
woman
alone
and
yet
with
proper
help
and
support
i
think
i
could
do
more
than
any
man
by
himself
there
is
that
in
a
womans
entreaties
which
will
win
when
a
man
may
fail
but
i
must
have
a
knight
at
my
side
a
protector
at
the
same
time
as
a
faithful
servant
these
are
not
the
times
to
stand
on
conventional
scruples
do
you
think
among
these
gentlemen
any
could
be
found
with
sufficient
enthusiasm
for
the
royal
cause
here
represented
by
me
to
attend
and
support
me
through
all
the
fatigues
the
endless
errands
the
interviewsay
also
the
rebuffs
the
ridicule
at
times
perhaps
the
danger
of
the
conjuration
which
must
be
set
on
foot
in
this
countryto
do
all
that
without
hope
of
other
reward
than
the
consciousness
of
helping
a
good
cause
andand
the
gratitude
of
one
who
may
have
nothing
else
to
give
she
stopped
with
a
little
nervous
laugh
no
it
is
absurd
no
man
on
reflection
would
enter
into
such
a
service
unless
it
were
for
his
own
country
as
the
last
words
fell
from
her
lips
she
suddenly
turned
to
adrian
and
met
his
earnest
gaze
or
for
his
kindred
said
the
young
man
coming
up
to
her
with
grave
simplicity

she
extended
her

allowing

to
linger
in

whilst
she
laid
the

tenderly
on

cavaliers
i
am
fortunate
indeed
in
my
misfortune
in
other
circumstances

be
difficult
between

so
good
but
she
added
after
a
moments
hesitation
and
looking
at
adrian
in
a
manner
that
made
the
young
mans
heart
beat
thickly
in
this
case
it
is
obvious
i
must
have
some

answered
madame
de
savenaye
smiling
upon
her
young
knight
as
taking
heart
of
grace
he
stooped
to
seal
the
treaty
upon
her
hand
to
say
the
truth
i
had
hoped
for
this
yet
hardly
dared
to
allow
myself
to
count
upon
it

i
am
indeed
strengthened
at
the
outset
of
my
undertaking
i
shall
pray
that
you
may
never
have
cause
to
regret
your
chivalrous
goodness
she
dropped
adrians
hand
with
a
faint
pressure
and
moved
sighing
towards
the
door
do
you
wonder
that
i
have
no
tears
cousin
she
said
a
little
wistfully
they
must
gather
in
my
heart
till
i
have
time
to
sit
down
and
shed
them
thus
it
was
that
a
letter
penned
by
this
unknown
m
de
puisaye
from
some
hidden
fastness
in
the
bocage
of
brittany
came
to
divert
the
course
of
adrian
landales
existence
into
a
channel
where
neither
he
nor
any
of
those
who
knew
him
would
ever
have
dreamed
to
see

oh
what
hadst
thou

cruel
death

sir
adrian
landale
in
his
seagirt
fastness
still
absorbed
in
dreams
of
bygone
days
loosed
his
grasp
of
faithful
rens
shoulder
and
fell
to
pacing
the
chamber
with
sombre
mien
while
ren
to
whom
these
fits
of
abstraction
in
his
master
were
not
unfamiliar
but
yet
to
his
superstitious
peasant
soul
eerie
and
aweinspiring
visitations
slipped
unnoticed
from
his
presence
the
lightkeeper
sate
down
by
his
lonely
hearth
and
buried
his
gaze
in
the
glowing
woodembers
over
which
with
each
fitful
thundering
rush
of
wind
round
the
chimney
fluttered
little
eddies
of
silvery
ash
so
that
long
strife
was
over
which
had
wrought
such
havoc
to
the
world
had
shaped
so
dismally
the
course
of
his
own
life
the
monster
of
selfish
ambition
the
tyrannic
insatiable
conqueror
whose
very
existence
had
so
long
made
peaceable
pursuits
unprofitable
to
mankind
the
final
outcome
of
that
revolution
that
at
the
starting
point
had
boded
so
nobly
for
human
welfarehe
was
at
last
laid
low
and
all
the
misery
of
the
protracted
struggle
now
belonged
to
the
annals
of
the
past
it
was
all
overbut
the
waste
the
waste
of
life
and
happiness
far
and
wide
away
among
innocent
and
uninterested
beings
the
waste
remained
and
looking
back
on
it
the
most
bitter
portion
of
his
own
wrecked
life
was
the
short
time
he
had
yet
thought
happy
three
months
spent
as
knighterrant
how
far
they
seemed
far
as
irrevocable
youth
those
days
when
in
the
wake
of
that
lovecompelling
emissary
he
moved
from
intrigue
to
intrigue
among
the
migrs
in
london
and
their
english
sympathisers
to
bustling
yet
secret
activity
in
seafaring
parts
the
mechanical
instrument
directed
by
the
ingenious
mind
of
ccile
de
savenaye
the
discreet
minister
who
for
all
his
young
years
secured
the
help
of
some
important
political
sympathiser
one
day
scoured
the
country
for
arms
and
clothing
powder
and
assignats
another
who
treated
with
smuggling
captains
and
chartered
vessels
that
were
to
run
the
gauntlet
on
the
norman
and
breton
coast
and
supply
the
means
of
war
to
struggling
and
undaunted
loyalists
all
this
relentless
work
little
suited
on
the
whole
to
an
englishman
and
in
a
cause
the
rights
of
which
he
himself
had
up
to
then
refused
to
admit
was
then
repaid
a
hundredfold
by
a
look
of
gratitude
of
pleasure
even
a
few
sweet
moments
of
his
ladys
company
before
being
sent
hence
again
upon
some
fresh
enterprise
ah
how
he
loved
her
he
the
youth
on
the
threshold
of
manhood
who
had
never
known
passion
before
how
he
loved
this
young
widowed
mother
who
used
him
as
a
man
to
deal
for
her
with
men
yet
so
loftily
treated
him
as
a
boy
when
she
dealt
with
him
herself
and
if
he
loved
her
in
the
earlier
period
of
his
thraldom
when
scarce
would
he
see
her
one
hour
in
the
twentyfour
to
what
allencompassing
fervour
did
the
bootless
passion
rise
when
the
day
of
departure
having
dawned
and
sunk
he
found
himself
on
board
the
privateer
sailing
away
with
her
towards
unknown
warlike
ventures
her
knight
to
protect
her
her
servant
to
obey
on
all
these
things
mused
the
recluse
of
scarthey
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
past
the
spell
of
haunting
recollection
closing
on
him
as
he
sat
by
his
hearthside
whilst
the
increasing
fury
of
the
gale
toiled
and
troubled
outside
fighting
the
impassable
walls
of
his
tower
could
it
have
been
possible
that
shethe
only
woman
that
had
ever
existed
for
him
the
love
for
whom
had
so
distorted
his
mind
from
its
natural
sympathies
had
killed
in
him
the
spring
of
youth
and
the
savour
of
lifenever
really
learnt
to
love
him
in
return
till
the
last
and
yet
there
was
a
womans
soul
in
that
delicious
womans
bodyit
showed
itself
at
least
once
though
until
that
supreme
moment
of
union
and
parting
it
seemed
as
if
a
mans
mind
alone
governed
it
becoming
sterner
more
unbendable
as
hardships
and
difficulties
multiplied
in
the
melancholy
phantasm
passing
before
his
minds
eye
of
a
period
of
unprecedented
bloodshed
and
savagery
when
on
the
one
side
chouans
vendens
and
such
guerillas
of
which
madame
de
savenaye
was
the
moving
spirit
and
on
the
other
the
colonnes
infernales
of
the
revolutionary
leaders
vied
with
each
other
in
ferocity
and
cunning
she
stood
ever
foremost
ever
the
central
point
of
thought
with
a
vividness
that
almost
a
score
of
years
had
failed
to
dim
when
the
mood
was
upon
him
he
could
unfold
the
roll
of
that
story
buried
now
in
the
lonely
graves
of
the
many
or
in
the
fickle
memories
of
the
few
but
upon
his
soul
printed
in
letters
of
fire
and
bloodto
endure
for
ever
round
this
goddess
of
his
young
and
only
love
clustered
the
sole
impressions
of
the
outer
world
that
had
ever
stirred
his
heart
the
grandeur
of
the
ocean
of
the
storm
the
glory
of
sunrise
over
a
dishevelled
sea
the
ineffable
melancholy
of
twilight
rising
from
an
unknown
strand
then
the
solemn
coldness
of
moonlight
watches
the
scent
of
the
burnt
land
under
the
fierce
sun
when
all
nature
was
hushed
save
the
dreamy
buzz
of
insectlife
the
green
coolness
of
underwood
or
forest
the
unutterable
harmony
of
the
sighing
breeze
and
the
song
of
wild
birds
during
the
long
patient
ambushes
of
partisan
war
the
taste
of
bread
in
hunger
of
the
stream
in
the
fever
of
thirst
of
approaching
sleep
in
exhaustionand
mixed
with
these
the
acrid
emotions
of
fight
and
carnage
anguish
of
suspense
savage
exultation
of
victoryall
the
doings
of
a
life
which
he
bred
to
intellectual
pleasures
and
high
moral
ideas
would
have
deemed
a
nightmare
but
which
lived
as
it
was
in
the
atmosphere
of
his
longing
and
devotion
yet
held
for
him
a
strange
and
pungent
joy
a
cup
of
cruel
memories
yet
one
to
be
lingered
over
luxuriously
till
the
savour
of
each
cherished
drop
of
bitterness
be
gathered
to
the
uttermost
now
in
the
brightness
of
the
embers
between
the
fitful
flames
of
crumbling
wood
spreads
before
his
eyes
the
dreary
strand
near
quiberon
immense
in
the
gathering
darkness
of
a
boisterous
evening
well
hidden
under
the
stone
table
of
a
druidical
menhir
glows
a
small
campfire
sedulously
kept
alive
by
ren
for
the
service
of
the
lady
she
wrapped
up
in
a
coarse
peasantcloak
pensively
gazes
into
the
cheerless
smoke
and
holds
her
worn
and
muddy
boots
to
the
smouldering
wood
in
the
vain
hope
of
warmth
and
adrian
stands
silently
behind
her
brooding
on
many
thingson
the
vicissitudes
of
that
desultory
war
which
has
left
them
not
a
roof
whereunder
they
can
lay
their
heads
during
which
the
little
english
contingent
has
melted
from
them
one
by
one
on
the
critical
action
of
the
morrow
when
the
republican
columns
now
hastening
to
oppose
the
landing
of
the
great
royalist
expedition
to
quiberon
that
supreme
effort
upon
which
all
their
hopes
centre
must
be
surprised
and
cut
off
at
whatever
cost
on
the
mighty
doings
to
follow
which
are
to
complete
the
result
of
the
recent
sea
fight
off
ushant
and
crown
their
devoted
toil
with
victory
at
last
and
through
his
thoughts
he
watches
the
pretty
foot
in
its
hideous
disguise
of
patched
worn
illfitting
leather
and
he
sees
it
as
on
the
first
day
of
their
meeting
in
its
gleaming
slipper
and
dainty
silken
stocking
now
and
then
an
owlcry
repeated
from
point
to
point
tells
of
unremitting
guard
but
for
which
in
the
vast
silence
none
could
suspect
that
a
thousand
men
and
more
are
lying
stretched
upon
the
plain
all
around
them
fireless
wellnigh
without
food
yet
patiently
waiting
for
the
morrow
when
their
chiefs
shall
lead
them

the
indomitable
savenaye
band
and
tacitly
sworn
bodyguard
to
the
lady

came
back
from
ease
and
safety
over
seas
to
share
their
peril

sound
besides

the
wind
as
it
whistles
and
moans
over
the
heathand
the
two
are
together
in
the

comes
closing

to
shroud
them
from
all

rest

even

crept
away
to
sleep
perhaps
she
turns
at
last
towards
him
her
small
face
in
the
dying
light
of
this
sullen
evening
how
wan
and
weatherbeaten
pensive
as
usual
cousin
she
says
in
english
and
extends
her
hand
browned
and
scratched
that
was
once
so
exquisite
and
she
smiles
the
smile
of
a
dauntless
soul
from
a
weary
body
poor
little
hands
poor
little
feet
so
cold
so
battered
so
illused
he
who

down
now
for
the

falling
on
his
knees
covers
the
cold
fingers
with
kisses
and
then
lays
his
lips
against
those
pitiful
torn
boots
but
she
spurns
him
from
hereven
from
her
feet

on
you
she
says
angrily
and
adds
more
gently

with
some
contempt
enfant

this
the
time
for
such
follies
and
suddenly
recalled
to
honour
and
grim
actuality
he
realises
with
dismay
his
breach
of
trusthe
who
in
their
earlier
days
in
london
had
called
out
that
sprightly
little
migr
merely
for
the
vulgar
flippancy
aimed
in
compliment
too
at
the
grave
aidedecamp
that
the
fate
of
the
late
count
weighed
somewhat
lightly
upon
madame
de
savenaye
he
who
had
struck
that
too
literary
countryman
of
his
own
across
the
faceay
and
shot
him
in
the
shoulder
all
in
the
secret
early
dawn
of
the
day
they
left
englandfor
daring
to
remark
within
his
hearing
by
george
the
handsome
frenchwoman
and
her
cousin
may
be
a
little
less
than
kin
but
they
are
a
little
more
than
kind
but
yet
as
the
rage
of
love
contending
in
his
heart
with
selfreproach
he
rises
to
his
feet
in
shame
she
gives
him
her
hand
once
more
and
in
a
different
voice
courage
cousin
says
she
perhaps
some
day
we
may
both
have
our
reward
but
will
not
my
knight
continue
to
fight
for
my
bidding
even
without
hope
of
such
pondering
on
this
enigmatic
sentence
he
leaves
her
to
her
rest





when
next
he
finds
himself
by
her
side
the
anticipated
action
has
begun
and
it
is
to
be
the
last
day
that
those
beautiful
burning
eyes
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
rising
sun
the
chouans
are
fighting
like
demons
extended
in
long
skirmishing
lines
picking
out
the
cluster
of
gunners
making
right
deadly
use
of
their
english
powder
imperceptibly
but
unflinchingly
closing
their
scattered
groups
until
the
signal
comes
and
with
ringing
cries
notre
dame
dauray
and
vive
le
roi
they
charge
undismayed
by
odds
the
serried
ranks
of
the
republicans
she
from
the
top
of
the
druidical
stone
watches
the
progress
of
the
day
her
red
parted
mouth
twitches
as
she
follows
the
efforts
of
the
men
behind
her
the
gars
of
savenaye
grasping
with
angry
clutch
some
a
new
musket
others
an
ancient
straightened
scythe
gaze
fiercely
on
the
scene
from
under
their
broad
felts
now
and
then
a
flight
of
republican
bullets
hum
about
their
ears
and
they
look
anxiously
to
their
lady
but
that
fearless
head
never
bends
then
the
moment
arrives
and
with
a
fervent
god
be
with
you
brave
people
she
hurls
by
a
stirring
gesture
the
last
reserve
on
to
the
fight
and
now
he
finds
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
furious
medley
striking
mechanically
his
soul
away
behind
on
that
stone
with
her
presently
as
the
frenzy
waxes
wilder
he
is
conscious
that
victory
is
not
with
them
but
that
they
are
pressed
back
and
encompassed
and
that
for
each
blue
coat
cast
down
amidst
the
yells
and
oaths
two
more
seem
to
come
out
of
the
rain
and
smoke
whilst
the
bare
feet
and
wooden
shoes
and
the
long
hair
of
his
peasants
are
seen
in
everlessening
ranks
and
in
time
they
find
themselves
thrown
back
to
the
menhir
she
is
there
still
calm
but
ghastly
white
a
pistol
in
each
hand
around
her
through
the
wet
smoke
rise
and
fall
with
sickening
thuds
the
clubbed
muskets
of
three
or
four
men
and
then
one
by
one
these
sink
to
the
ground
too
with
a
wailing
groan
like
a
man
in
a
nightmare
he
sees
the
inevitable
end
and
rushes
to
place
his
body
before
hers
a
bullet
shatters
his
swordblade
now
none
are
left
around
them
but
the
begrimed
and
sinister
faces
of
their
enemies
as
they
stand
prisoners
and
unheeding
the
hideous
clamour
he
with
despair
thinking
of
her
inevitable
fate
at
the
hands
of
such
victors
and
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
her
suddenly
sees
that
in
her
eyes
which
fills
his
soul
to
overflowing
all
is
lost
she
whispers
and
i
shall
never
repay
you
for
all
you
have
done
cousin
the
words
are
uttered
falteringly
almost
plaintively
we
are
not
long
now
for
this
world
friend
she
adds
more
firmly
give
me
your
forgiveness
how
often
has
adrian
heard
this
dead
voice
during
the
strange
vicissitudes
of
these
long
long
years
and
hearing
it
whisper
in
the
vivid
world
of
his
brain
how
often
has
he
not
passionately
longed
that
he
also
had
been
able
to
yield
his
poor
spark
of
life
on
the
last
day
of
her
existence
for
the
usual
fate
of

thee

haunting

assumed
such
lurid

in
torment
from

unceasingly
the
length

breadth

restful
studious
room

back
in

in

the
angry
breakers
slowly
agonisingly
he
is
recalled
to
life
through
wheeling
spaces
of
pain
and
confusion
only
that
his
bruised
and
smarting
eyes
may
see
the
actual
proof
of
his
own
desolatenessa
small
stark
figure
wrapped
in
coarse
sailcloth
which
now
two
or
three
ragged
longhaired
men
are
silently
lifting
between
them
he
wonders
at
first
vaguely
why
the
tears
course
down
those
wild
dark
faces
and
then
as
vainly
he
struggles
to
speak
and
is
gently
held
down
by
some
unknown
hand
the
little
white
bundle
is
gone
and
he
knows
that
there
was
the
pitiful
relict
of
his
lovethat
he
will
never
see
her
again





sir

halted
in

of
his
seaward

staring
at

driven

bounded

spread
in

for
some

at

back

that
was
shining
on
him

upon

his
brain
whirling
with
a
frenzy
of
joy
gripped
in
its
soaring
ecstasy
by
terror
of
the
incomprehensible
on
the
wings
of
the
storm
and
the
wind
had
she
come
to
him
his
loveacross
the
awful
barriers
that
divide
life
and
death
had
his
longings
and
the
clamour
of
his
desolate
soul
reached
her
after
all
these
years
in
the
farbeyond
and
was
her
sweet
ghost
here
to
bid
him
cease
from
them
and
let
her
lie
at
rest
or
yet
had
she
come
to
call
him
from
the
weary
world
that
their
souls
might
meet
and
be
one
at
last
then
let
her
but
lay
her
lips
against
his
as
once
in
the
bitterness
of
death
that
his
sorelytried
heart
may
break
with
the
exquisite
pang
and
he
too
may
die
upon
their
kiss
swift
such
thoughts
were
tossing
in
the
turmoil
of
his
mind
when
the
vision
smiled

a
young
rosy
living
smile
and
then
reason
memory
the
wonder
of
her
coming
the
haunting
of
her
grave
went
from
him
possessed
by
one
single
rapturous
certainty
he
started
up
and
gathered
the
wet
form
into
his
strong
armsyet
gently
as
if
he
feared
to
crush
the
vision
into
voidand
showered
kisses
on
the
wet
face
not
deathbut
life
a
beating
heart
beneath
his
a
lithe
young
form
under
his
hand
warm
lips
to
his
kisses

merciful
heaven
were
then
these
twenty
years
all
an
evil
fevered
dream
and
was
he
awake
at
length
she
turned
her
face
from
him
after
a
moment
and
put
her
hand
against
his
breast
to
push
him
from
her
and
as
she
did
so
the
wonder
in
the
lovely
familiar
eyes
turned
to
merriment
and
the
lips
parted
into
laughter
the
sound
of
the
girlish
laughter
broke
the
spell
sir
adrian
stepped
back
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
with
a
dazed
look
and
still
she
laughed
on
why
cousin
landale
she
said
at
length
between
the
peals
i
came
to
throw
myself
upon
your
kindness
for
shelter
from
the
storm
buti
had
not
anticipated
such
a
reception
the
voice
clear
and
sweet
with
just
a
tinge
of
outlandish
intonation
struck
adrian
to
the
heart
i
have
not
heard
he
faltered
that
voice
for
twenty
years
then
coming
up
to
her
he
took
her
hands
and
drawing
her
towards
the
firelight
scanned
her
features
with
eager
hungering
eyes
do
not
think
me
mad
child
he
said
at
last
tell
me
who
you
arewhat
has
brought
you
here
ah
god
at
such
a
moment
who
is
it
he
pursued
as
if
to
himself
whilst
still
she
smiled
mockingly
and
answered
not
who
is
it
then
since
ccile
de
savenaye
is
deadand
i
am
not
dreamingnor
in
fever
no
vision
eitherthis
is
flesh
and
blood
yes
indeed
mocked
the
girl
with
another
burst
of
merriment
flesh
and
blood
please
and
very
living
why
cousin
landale
you
that
knew
ccile
de
savenaye
so
well
have
you
forgotten
two
babes
that
were
born
at
your
own
house
of
pulwick
i
believe
tis
true
i
have
somewhat
altered
since
you
saw
me
last
and
again
the
old
room
echoed
to
the
unwonted
sound
of
a
girls
laughter
now
was
the
hallucination
clearing
but
the
reality
evoked
a
new
and
almost
as
poignant
tenderness
ccilephantom
of
a
lifetimes
love
reborn
in
the
flesh
young
as
on
the
last
day
of
her
earthly
existence
coming
back
into
his
life
again
even
the
same
as
she
had
left
it
a
second
wonder
almost
as
sweet
as
the
first
he
clung
to
it
as
one
clings
to
the
presence
of
a
dream
and
joy
unspeakable
the
dream
did
not
melt
away
but
remained
smiling
beautiful
unchanged
cciles
daughter

he
murmured
cciles
self
again
but
she
was
not
so
tall
i
think
and
drew
trembling
reverent
hands
from
her
head
to
her
straight
young
shoulders
and
then
he
started
crying
in
a
changed
voice
how
wet
and
cold
you
are
come
closer
to
the
firesit
you
into
this
chair
here
in
the
warmth
he
piled
up
the
hearth
with
faggots
till
the
flames
roared
again
she
dropped
into
the
proffered
chair
with
a
little
shiver
now
that
he
recalled
her
to
it
she
was
wet
and
cold
too
he
surveyed
her
with
gathering
concern
my
child
he
began
and
hesitated
continuing
after
a
short
pause
of
musingfor
the
thought
struck
him
as
strangei
may
call
you
so
i
suppose
i
that
am
nearly
old
enough
to
be
your
father
my
mind
was
so
unhinged
by
your
sudden
appearance
by
the
wonderful
resemblance
that
i
have
neglected
all
my
duties
as
host
you
will
suffer
from
thiswhat
shall
we
do
to
comfort
you
here
jem
good
dog
call
ren
the
old
retriever
who
concluding
that
the
visitor
was
welcome
had
returned
to
his
doze
here
gathered
his
stiff
limbs
together
hobbled
out
through
the
doorway
to
give
two
or
three
yelping
barks
at
some
point
on
the
stairs
and
then
crawl
back
to
his
cosy
corner
by
the
hearth
the
girl
laughed
again
it
was
all
odd
new
exciting
adrian
looked
down
at
her
ccile
too
had
had
a
merry
heart
even
through
peril
and
misfortune
and
now
there
were
hasty
steps
upon
the
stairs
creaking
above
the
outer
tumult
of
sea
and
wind
and
in
accordance
with
the
longestablished
custom
of
summoning
him
ren
appeared
upon
the
threshold
holding
a
pair
of
candles
at
the
sight
of
the
figure
sitting
by
the
fire
he
halted
as
if
rooted
to
the
ground
and
threw
up
his
hands
each
still
clutching
its
candle
mademoiselle
he
ejaculated
mademoiselle
here
then
rapidly
recovering
his
quick
wits
he
deposited
his
burden
of
light
upon
the
table
advanced
towards
the
lady
made
an
uncouth
but
profound
bow
and
turned
to
his
master
and
this
your
honour
he
remarked
oracularly
and
in
his
usual
manner
of
literal
adaptation
was
also
part
of
the
news
i
had
for
your
honour
from
my
last
journey
but
my
faith
i
did
not
know
how
to
take
myself
to
it
as
your
honour
was
so
much
occupied
with
old
times
this
evening
but
i
had
seen
mademoiselle
at
the
castle
as
mademoiselle
can
tell
you
herself
and
if
your
honour
he
added
with
a
look
of
astonishment
will
have
the
goodness
to
say
how
it
is
possible
that
mademoiselle
managed
to
arrive
here
on
our
isle
in
this
weather
of
all
the
devilsreverence
speaking
and
i
humbly
beg
the
pardon
of
mademoiselle
for
using
such
wordswhen
it
was
with
pain
i
could
land
myself
and
that
before
the
stormi
should
be
grateful
to
your
honour
for
i
avow
i
cannot
comprehend
it
at
all
ah
your
honour
continued
ren
with
an
altered
tone
tis
a
strange
thing
this
the
looks
of
master
and
man
crossed
suddenly
and
in
the
frank
blue
eyes
of
the
breton
peasant
sir
adrian
read
a
reflex
of
his
own
thoughts
yes
he
said
more
in
answer
to
the
look
than
to
the
exclamation
yes
it
is
a
strange
thing
friend
and
his
honour
cannot
read
the
riddle
any
more
than
you
yourself
ren
quoth
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
composedly
from
her
corner
and
as
for
me
i
can
give
no
explanations
until
i
am
a
little
warmer
why
truly
exclaimed
sir
adrian
striking
his
forehead
we
are
a
very
pair
of
dolts
hurry
renny
hurry
call
up
margery
and
bid
her
bring
some
hot
drinktea
broth
or
what
she
hasand
blankets
stay
first
fetch
my
furred
cloak
quick
ren
every
moment
is
precious
with
all
the
agitation
of
a
rarely
excited
man
sir
adrian
threw
more
wood
on
the
fire
hunted
for
a
cushion
to
place
beneath
her
feet
and
then
seizing
the
cloak
from
rens
hands
he
helped
her
to
rise
and
wrapped
its
ample
folds
round
her
as
carefully
as
if
she
were
too
precious
almost
to
be
touched
thus
enveloped
she
sank
back
in
the
great
armchair
with
a
cosy
deliberate
kittenlike
movement
and
stretched
out
her
feet
to
the
blaze
laying
the
little
shoeless
one
upon
jems
grey
muzzle
adrian
knelt
beside
her
and
began
gently
to
chafe
it
with
both
hands
and
as
he
knelt
silence
fell
between
them
and
the
storm
howled
out
yonder
he
heard
her
give
a
little
sighthat
sigh
which
would
escape
from
cciles
weariness
in
moments
of
rest
which
had
once
been
so
familiar
and
so
pathetic
a
sound
in
his
ear
and
once
more
the
power
of
the
past
came
over
him
again
he
was
upon
the
heath
near
quiberon
and
ccile
was
sitting
by
him
and
seeking
warmth
by
the
secret
fire
oh
my
darling
he
murmured
your
poor
little
feet
were
so
cold
and
yet
you
would
not
let
me
gather
them
to
my
breast
and
stooping
slowly
he
kissed
the
pretty
foot
in
its
torn
stained
stocking
with
a
passion
he
had
not
yet
shown
the
girl
looked
on
with
an
odd
little
smile
it
was
a
novel
experience
to
inspireeven
vicariouslysuch
feelings
as
these
and
there
was
something
not
unpleasant
in
the
sense
of
the
power
which
had
brought
this
strange
handsome
man
prostrate
before
hera
maidenly
tremor
too
in
the
sensation
of
those
burning
lips
upon
her
feet
he
raised
his
eyes
suddenly
with
the
old
expectation
of
a
rebuff
and
then
at
the
sight
of
the
youthful
curious
face
above
him
betook
himself
to
sighing
too
and
laying
the
little
foot
back
tenderly
upon
the
cushion
he
rose
from
between
the
huge
fur
collar
which
all
but
covered
her
head
the
black
eyes
followed
him
as
alertly
as
a
birds
intercepting
the
soft
melancholy
of
his
gaze
she
smiled
at
him
mischievous
confident
and
uncommunicative
and
snuggled
deeper
into
the
fur
leaning
against
the
high
mantelboard
he
remained
silent
brooding
over
her
the
clock
ticked
off
solemnly
the
fleeting
moments
of
the
wonderful
hour
and
ever
and
anon
the
dog
drew
a
long
breath
of
comfort
and
stretched
out
his
gaunt
limbs
more
luxuriously
to
the
heat
after
a
while
sir
adrian
spoke
he
who
has
hospitality
to
dispense
said
he
smiling
down
at
her
mutinous
grace
should
never
ask
whence
or
how
the
guest
came
to
his
hearth

and
yet
she
made
a
slight
movement
of
laziness
but
volunteered
nothing
and
he
continued
his
look
becoming
more
wistful
as
he
spoke
your
having
reached
this
rock
during
such
weather
is
startling
enough
it
is
gods
providence
that
there
should
live
those
in
these
ruins
who
are
able
to
give
you
succour
but
that
you
should
come
in
to
me
at
the
moment
you
did
he
halted
before
the
bold
inquisitive
brightness
of
her
eyes
some
day
perhaps
you
will
let
me
explain
he
went
on
embarrassed
indeed
i
must
have
seemed
the
most
absolute
madman
to
you
but
he
who
thinks
he
sees
one
returned
from
death
in
angry
waters
may
be
pardoned
some
display
of
emotion
the
girl
sat
up
briskly
and
shook
herself
as
if
in
protest
against
the
sadness
of
his
smile
and
look
i
rise
indeed
from
a
watery
grave
she
said
lightly
or
at
least
from
what
should
have
been
my
grave
had
i
had
my
deserts
for
my
foolishness
as
it
has
turned
out
i
do
not
regret
it
now
though
i
did
about
midway
the
red
lips
parted
and
the
little
teeth
gleamed
i
have
found
such
kindness
and
welcome
she
caressed
the
dog
who
lazily
tried
to
lick
her
hand
it
is
all
such
an
adventure
so
much
more
amusing
than
pulwick
so
much
more
interesting
than
ever
i
fancied
it
might
be
pulwick
you
come
from
pulwick
said
sir
adrian
musing
true
ren
has
said
it
but
just
now
yet
it
is
of
a
piece
with
the
strangeness
of
it
all
yes
said
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
once
more
collecting
her
cloak
which
her
hurried
movement
had
thrown
off
her
shoulder
madelon
and
i
are
now

rememberor
rather

am

warm
now

along

as
wet
as
drowned
rats
well
well
i
had
best
tell
you
the
tale
from
the
beginning
or
else
we
never
shall
be
out
of
the
labyrinthwe
started
from
pulwick
for
a
ride
by
the
shore
madelon
and
i
when
we
were
on
the
strand
it
came
on
to
rain
there
was
smoke
out
of
your
chimney
i
proposed
a
canter
as
far
as
the
ruins
for
shelter
i
knew
very
well
madelon
would
not
follow
but
i
threw
poor
luciferyou
know
lucifer
mr
landale
has
reserved
him
for
me
of
course
you
know
lucifer
i
believe
he
belongs
to
you
well
i
threw
him
along
the
causeway
john
hes
the
groom
you
know
and
madelon
shrieked
after
me
but
it
was
beautifulthis
magnificent
tearing
gallop
in
the
raini
was
not
going
to
stopbut
when
we
were
half
way
lucifer
and
i
i
saw
suddenly
that
the
foam
seemed
to
cover
the
sand
in
front
of
me
then
i
pulled
up
quick
and
turned
round
to
look
behind
me
there
was
already
a
frightful
wind
and
the
sand
and
the
rain
blinded
me
almost
but
there
was
no
mistakethe
sea
was
running
between
the
shore
and
me
oh
my
god
but
i
was
frightened
then
i
beat
poor
lucifer
until
my
whip
broke
and
he
started
away
with
a
will
but
when
his
feet
began
to
splash
the
water
he
too
became
frightened
and
stopped
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
pulled
out
my
broach
to
spur
him
with
the
pin
but
at
the
first
prick
i
gave
him
he
reared
and
swerved
and
i
fell
right
on
my
face
in
the
froth
i
got
up
and
began
to
run
through
the
water
then
i
came
to
some
stones
and
i
knew
i
was
saved
though
the
water
was
up
to
my
knees
and
rushing
by
like
a
torrent
when
i
had
clambered
up
the
beach
i
thought
again
of
poor
lucifer
i
looked
about
and
saw
him
a
little
way
off
he
was
shaking
and
tossing
his
dear
black
head
and
neighing
though
i
really
did
not
hear
him
for
the
wind
was
in
my
ears
his
body
was
stock
still
i
could
not
see
his
legs
and
gradually
he
sank
lower
and
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
the
water
passed
over
his
head
oh
it
was
horrible
horrible
the
girl
shuddered
and
her
bright
face
clouded
after
a
moment
she
resumed
it
was
only
then
i
thought
of
the
moving
sands
they
spoke
of
the
other
day
at
pulwickand
that
was
why
madelon
and
that
poltroon
groom
would
not
follow
me
yet
perhaps
they
were
wise
after
all
for
the
thought
of
being
buried
alive
made
me
turn
weak
all
of
a
sudden
my
knees
shook
and
i
had
to
sit
down
although
i
knew
i
had
passed
through
the
danger
but
i
was
so
sorry
for
poor
lucifer
i
thought
if
i
had
come
down
and
led
him
poor
fellow
he
might
have
come
with
me
death
is
so
awful
so
hideous
he
was
so
full
of
life
and
carried
me
so
bravely
only
a
few
minutes
before
is
it
not
a
shame
that
there
should
be
such
a
thing
as
death
she
cried
rebelliously
and
looked
up
at
the
man
above
her
whose
face
had
grown
white
at
the
thought
of
the
danger
she
had
barely
escaped
i
waited
she
resumed
at
length
till
i
thought
he
must
be
quite
dead
there
below
and
came
up
to
the
ruins
and
looked
for
an
entrance
i
knocked
at
some
doors
and
called
but
the
wind
was
so
loud
no
one
heard
and
then
at
last
there
was
one
door
i
could
open
so
i
entered
and
came
up
the
stairs
and
startled
you
as
you
know
and
that
is
how
i
came
here
and
how
lucifer
is
drowned
as
she
finished
her
tale
at
last
she
looked
up
at
her
companion
but
sir
adrian
who
had
followed
her
with
everdeepening
earnestness
of
mien
remained
silent
noticing
which
she
added
quickly
and
with
a
certain
tinge
of
defiance
and
now
no
doubt
you
are
not
quite
so
pleased
as
you
seemed
at
first
with
the
apparition
which
has
caused
you
the
loss
of
one
of
your
best
horses
why
child
cried
sir
adrian
so
that
you
be
safe
you
might
have
left
all
pulwick
at
the
bottom
of
the
sands
for
me
and
ren
who
entered
the
room
at
that
moment
heading
the
advance
of
dame
margery
with
the
posset
here
caught
the
extraordinary
sound
of
a
laugh
on
his
masters
lips
and
stepped
back
to
chuckle
to
himself
and
rub
his
hands
who
would
have
believed
that
he
muttered
and
i
who
was
afraid
to
tell
his
honour
oh
yes
there
are
better
times
coming
now
in
with
you
mother
margery
see
for
yourself
who
is
there
holding
in
both
hands
a
fragrant
steaming
bowl
the
old
crone
made
her
slow
entrance
upon
the
scene
peering
with
dim
eyes
and
dropping
tremulous
curtseys
every
two
or
three
steps
renny
towd
me
as
you
wanted
summat
hot
for
a
lady
she
began
cautiously
and
then
having
approached
near
for
recognition
at
last
burst
forth
into
a
longdrawn
cry
eh
you
never
says
eh
dear
o
me
and
was
fain
to
relinquish
the
bowl
to
her
fellowservant
who
narrowly
watching
dived
forward
just
in
time
to
catch
it
from
her
that
she
might
clasp
her
aged
hands
together
once
and
again
with
everrenewed
gestures
of
astonishment
an
it
were
truth
then
an
i
that
towd
renny
to
give
over
his
nonsensei
didnt
believe
it
i
welly
couldnt
eh
mester
adrian
but
shes
like
the
poor
lady
thats
dead
and
gone
the
spit
an
image
she
iseeh
she
is
molly
de
savenaye
laughed
aloud
stretched
out
her
hand
for
the
bowl
and
began
with
dainty
caution
to
sip
its
scalding
contents
ah
my
dear
margery
said
the
master
we
little
thought
what
a
guest
the
sea
would
cast
up
at
our
doors
tonight
and
now
we
must
do
our
best
for
her
when
shes
finished
your
comforting
mixture
i
shall
give
her
into
your
charge
you
ought
to
put
her
to
bedit
will
not
be
the
first
time
ah
it
will
not
and
a
troublesome
child
she
was
replied
margery
after
the
usual
pause
for
the
assimilation
of
his
remark
turning
to
the
speaker
from
her
palsied
yet
critical
survey
of
her
whilom
nursling
and
ill
see
to
her
never
fear
ill
fettle
up
a
room
for
her

so
that
as
soon
as
miss
here
is
ready
i
am
upon
which
dropping
a
last
curtsey
with
an
assumed
dignity
which
would
have
befitted
a
mistress
of
the
robes
she
took
her
departure
leaving
adrian
smiling
with
amusement
at
her
specious
manner
of
announcing
that
his
own
bedroomthe
only
one
available
for
the
purpose
in
the
ruinswas
being
duly
converted
into
a
ladys
bower
it
grieves
me
to
think
mused
he
after
a
pause
while
ren
still
bursting
with
ungratified
curiosity
hung
about
the
further
end
of
the
room
of
the
terrible
anxiety
they
must
be
in
about
you
at
pulwick
and
of
our
absolute
inability
to
convey
to
them
the
good
news
of
your
safety
the
girl
gave
a
little
laugh
with
her
lips
over
the
cup
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
said
nothing
my
god
yes
quoth
ren
cheerfully
from
his
corner
notre
dame
dauray
has
watched
over
mademoiselle
today
she
would
not
permit
the
daughter
to
die
like
the
mother
and
now
we
have
got
her
ladyship
we
shall
keep
her
too
this
if
your
honour
remembers
his
sailors
knowledge
looks
like
a
threedays
gale
you
are
right
i
fancy
said
sir
adrian
going
over
to
him
and
looking
out
of
the
window
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
will
have
to
take
up
her
abode
in
our
lighthouse
for
a
longer
time
than
she
bargained
i
do
not
remember
hearing
the
breakers
thunder
in
our
cave
so
loud
for
many
years
i
trust
continued
the
lightkeeper
coming
down
to
his
fair
guest
again
that
you
may
be
able
to
endure
such
rough
hospitality
as
ours
must
needs
be
it
has
been
much
more
pleasant
and
i
feel
far
more
welcome
already
than
at
pulwick
remarked
mademoiselle
between
two
deliberate
sips
and
in
no
way
discomposed
it
seemed
at
the
prospect
held
out
to
her
how
cried
sir
adrian
with
a
start
while
the
unwonted
flush
mounted
to
his
forehead
you
not
welcome
at
pulwick
have
they
not
welcomed
a
child
of
ccile
de
savenaye
at
pulwick
thank
god
then
for
the
accident
that
has
sent
you
to
me
the
girl
looked
at
him
with
an
inquisitive
smile
in
her
eyes
there
was
something
on
her
lips
which
she
restrained
surrendering
her
cup
she
remarked
demurely
yes
it
was
a
lucky
accident
was
it
not
that
there
was
some
one
to
offer
shelter
to
the
outcast
from
the
sea
it
is
like
a
tale
of
old
it
is
delightful
delightful
too
not
to
be
drowned
safe
and
sound

and
welcome
in
this
curious
old
place
she
had
risen
and
as
the
cloak
fell
from
her
steaming
garments
again
she
shivered
but
you
are
right
she
said
i
must
go
to
bed
and
get
these
damp
garments
off
and
so
my
lord
of
scarthey
i
will
retire
to
my
apartments
my
lady
in
waiting
i
see
yonder
is
ready
for
me
with
a
quaint
mixture
of
playfulness
and
gravity
she
extended
her
hand
and
adrian
stooped
and
kissed
itas
he
had
kissed

forebodings
of
gladness
molly
de
savenaye
in
her
improvised
bedroom
wet
as
she
was
could
hardly
betake
herself
to
disrobing
so
amused
was
she
in
surveying
the
fresh
and
romantic
oddity
of
her
surroundings
with
their
mixture
of
barbarous
rudeness
and
almost
womanish
refinement
old
margerys
fumbling
hands
were
not
nimble
either
and
it
was
long
since
she
had
acted
as
attendant
upon
one
of
her
own
sex
and
so
the
matter
progressed
but
slowly
but
the
speed
of
margerys
tongue
was
apparently
not
affected
by
its
length
of
service
it
wagged
ceaselessly
the
girl
between
her
own
moods
of
curious
speculation
vouchsafing
an
amused
halfcontemptuous
ear
presently
however
as
the
nurses
reminiscences
wandered
from
the
less
interesting
topic
of
her
own
vicissitudes
the
children
she
had
reared
or
buried
and
the
marvellous
ailments
she
had
endured
to
an
account
of
those
days
when
she
had
served
the
french
madam
and
her
babes
molly
slowly
peeling
a
clinging
sleeve
from
her
arm
turned
a
more
eager
and
attentive
face
to
her
ah
quoth
margery
appraising
her
with
blear
eyes
its
a
queer
thing
how
ye
favour
your
mother
miss
she
had
just
they
beautiful
shoulders
and
arms
as
firm
an
as
white
but
youre
taller
i
think
and
may
be
so
to
speak
a
stouter
make
altogether
eh
dear
you
were
always
a
fine
child
and
the
poor
lady
set
a
deal
of
store
on
you
she
did
she
took
you
with
her
and
left
your
sister
with
my
sally
when
she
was
trapesing
up
to
london
and
back
with
mester
adrian
ay
and
me
with
ye
and
many
the
day
that
i
wished
myself
safe
at
pulwick
and
i
mind
the
day
she
took
leave
of
you
i
do
that
well
here
dame
margery
paused
and
shook
her
head
solemnly
then
pursued
in
another
key
see
now
miss
dear
just
step
out
of
they
wet
things
will
ye
now

said
molly
gratefully
wrapping
the
hot
linen
round
her
young
beauty
and
beginning
to
rub
her
black
locks
energetically
where
was
it
my

parted
from
me

o
change
came
over

her
up
in
his
arms
just

as
another
bairn
an
carried
her
to
the
boat
yes
said
molly
gazing
into
the
burning
logs
with
brilliant
eyes
but
speaking
low
as
if
to
herself
so
that
her
attendants
deaf
ears
failed
to
catch
the
meaning
of
the
words
ah
that
was
life
indeed
happy
mother
to
have
seen
such
lifethough
she
did
die
young
as
ye
say
miss
answered
margery
making
a
guess
at
the
most
likely
comment
from
a
daughters
lips
it
was
cruel
hardit
was
that
come
make
haste
cries
the
other
young
gentlemen
my
word
they
were
in
a
hurry
lest
madam
happen
to
change
her
mind
i
could
welly
have
laughed
to
see
their
faces
when
mester
adrian
were
trying
to
persuade
her
to
stop
at
pulwick
and
let
the
men
go
alone
t
wernt
for
that
they
reckoned
to
go
all
that
road
to
france
ye
may
think
miss
well
miss
in
a
few
minutes
they
was
all
out
i
the
boat
wi
th
waves
tossin
eman
i
stood
watchin
with
you
i
my
arms
cryin
and
kickin
out
wi
your
little
legs
an
hittin
of
me
wi
your
little
ands
same
as
if
ye
knowed
summat
o
what
was
agate
poor
lamb
an
was
angry
wi
me
for
keepin
ye
then
in
a
little
while
the
big
white
sails
o
th
ship
went
swellin
out
an
soon
it
was
gone
an
that
was
th
last
we
saw
o
madam
a
twothree
year
arter
you
an
miss
maddyline
was
fetched
away
to
france
as
ive
been
towd
i
doubt
you
didnt
so
much
as
think
there
was
such
a
place
as
pulwick
though
many
a
one
there
minds
how
they
dandled
and
played
wi
you
when
you
was
a
wee
bairn
miss
well
i
am
very
glad
to
be
back
in
england
anyhow
said
molly
nimbly
slipping
into
bed
oh
margery
what
delicious
warm
sheets
and
how
good
it
is
to
be
in
bed
alive
dry
and
warm
after
all
a
new
atmosphere
pervaded
scarthey
that
night
the
peaceful
monotony
of
years
since
the
master
of
pulwick
had
migrated
to
his
ruins
was
broken
at
last
and
happily
a
warm
colour
seemed
to
have
crept
upon
the
hitherto
dun
and
dull
surroundings
and
brightened
all
the
prospects
at
any
rate
ren
over
his
busy
work
in
the
lantern
whistled
and
hummed
snatches
of
song
with
unwonted
blithesomeness
and
after
lighting
the
steady
watchlight
and
securing
all
his
paraphernalia
with
extra
care
dallied
some
time
longer
than
usual
on
the
outer
platform
striving
to
snatch
through
the
driven
wraith
a
glance
of
the
distant
lights
of
pulwick
for
there
in
the
long
distance
ensconced
among
the
woods
stood
a
certain
gatelodge
of
greystone
much
covered
with
ivy
which
sheltered
among
other
inmates
the
gatekeepers
blueeyed
ripe
and
ruddy
daughterdame
margerys
pet
grandchild
the
idea
of
ever
leaving
the
mastereven
for
the
sake
of
the
happiness
to
be
found
over
yonderwas
not
one
to
be
entertained
by
ren
but
what
if
dreams
of
a
return
to
the
life
of
the
world
should
arise
after
today
in
the
recluses
mind
ah
the
masters
eyes
had
been
filled
with
light
and
had
he
not
actually
laughed
ren
peered
again
through
the
wind
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
world
abroad
save
grey
tumbling
waters
foaming
at
the
foot
of
the
islet
fretful
waters
coalescing
all
around
with
the
driven
misty
air
a
desolate
view
enough
had
there
been
room
for
melancholy
thoughts
in
his
heart
blithely
did
he
descend
the
steep
wooden
stairs
from
the
roaring
weatherbeaten
platform
to
the
more
secure
inhabited
keep
and
humming
a
satisfied
tune
he
entered
upon
margery
in
her
flaming
kitchen
to
find
the
old
lady
intent
on
sorting
out
a
heap
of
feminine
garments
and
spreading
them
before
the
fire
ren
took
up
a
little
shoe
sandsoiled
and
limp
and
reverentially
rubbed
it
on
his
sleeve
well
mother
he
said
cheerfully
it
is
a
long
while
since
you
had
to
do
with
such
pretty
things
my
faith
these
are
droll
doings
ahand
good
too
you
will
see
mother
margery
there
will
be
good
out
of
all
this
but
margery
invariably
saw
fit
on
principle
to
doubt
all
the
opinions
of
her
rival
eh
she
didnt
hold
so
much
wi
wenches
hersel
an
mester
adrian
she
reckoned
hadnt
come
to
live
here
all
by
himsel
to
have
visitors
breaking
in
on
him
that
gate
there
be
visitors
and
visitors
motheri
tell
you
i
who
speak
to
you
that
his
honour
is
happy
margery
with
a
mysterious
air
smoothed
out
a
long
silk
stocking
and
gave
an
additional
impetus
to
the
tremor
nature
had
already
bestowed
upon
her
aged
head
well
it
wasnt
for
her
to
say
she
hoped
and
prayed
there
was
nowt
bad
a
coomin
on
the
family
again
but
sich
likenesses
as
that
of
miss
to
her
mother
was
not
lucky
to
her
minding
it
was
not
nowt
good
had
come
to
mester
adrian
from
the
french
madam
ah
mester
adrian
had
been
happy
like
with
her
too
and
she
had
taken
him
away
from
his
home
an
his
people
an
sent
him
back
wiout
s
soul
in
the
end
and
now
her
daughter
has
come
to
give
it
him
back
retorted
ren
as
he
fell
to
with
a
zest
on
the
savoury
mess
he
had
concocted
for
his
own
supper
eh
well
i
hope
nowt
bads
i
the
road
said
margery
with
senile
iteration
they
do
say
no
good
ever
comes
o
saving
bodies
from
drowning
not
that
one
ud
wish
the
poor
miss
to
have
gone
into
the
sandsan
she
the
babby
i
weaned
too
ren
interrupted
her
with
a
hearty
laugh
yes
every
one
knows
it
carries
misfortune
to
save
people
from
the
drowning
but
there
you
see
her
ladyship
she
saved
herselfso
that
ought
to
bring
good
fortune
goodnight
mother
margery
take
good
care
of
the
lady
ah
how
i
wish
i
had
the
care
of
her
he
added
simply
and
seizing
his
lantern
proceeded
to
ascend
once
more
to
his
post
aloft
he
paused
once
on
his
way
in
the
loud
sighing
stairs
struck
with
a
fresh
aspect
of
the
days
singular
eventsa
quaint
thought
born
of
his
native
religious
faith
the
lady
the
dear
mistress
had
just
reached
heaven
no
doubt
and
had
straightway
sent
them
the
young
one
to
console
and
comfort
them
eh
bien
they
had
had
their
time
of
purgatory
too
and
now
they
might
be
happy
pleasant
therefore
were
rens
musings
up
in
the
light
watchers
bunk
underneath
the
lantern
as
smoking
a
pipe
of
rest
he
listened
complacently
to
the
hissing
storm
around
him
and
in
the
masters
sleeping
chamber
beneath
him
now
so
curiously
turned
into
a
feminine
sanctum
pleasant
thoughts
too
if
less
formed
and
less
concerned
with
the
future
lulled
its
dainty
occupant
to
rest
luxuriously
stretched
between
the
warm
lavenderscented
sheets
watching
from
her
pillow
the
leaping
fire
on
the
hearth
miss
molly
wondered
lazily
at
her
own
luck
at
the
many
possible
results
of
the
days
escapade
wondered
amusedly
whether
any
poignant
sorrowexcept
indeed
poor
madeleines
tearsfor
her
supposed
demise
really
darkened
the
supper
party
at
pulwick
this
evening
wondered
agreeably
how
the
lord
of
the
ruined

for
one
who
ever
cherished
ideal

for
the

the
man
of

as
his

must
be
admitted

dealt
with

degraded
into

beast
roamed
through
the
marais
with
chouan
bands
hunted
down
by
the
merciless
revolutionists
like
vermin
falling
as
months
of
that
existence
passed
over
him
from
his
high
estate
to
the

scarcely
better
the
long
months
of
confinement
in
the
hulks
of
rochelle
how
often
he
had
regretted
it
then
not
to
have
been
one
of
the
chosen
few
who
the
day
after
capture
stood
in

of
six
levelled
muskets
and
were
sped
to
rest
in
some
unknown
charnel

now
no
it
was
worth
having
lived
to
this
hour
to
know
of
that
fair
face
in
living
sleep
upon
his
pillow
under
the
safeguard
of
his
roof
good
it
was
that
he
had
escaped
at
last
though
with
the
blood
of
one
of
his
jailors
red
upon
his
hands
the
blood
of
a
perhaps
innocent
man
upon
his
soul
it
was
the
only
time
he
had
taken
a
life
other
than
in
fair
fight
and
the
thought
of
it
had
been
wont
to
fill
him
with
a
sort
of
nausea
but
tonight
he
found
he
could
face
it
not
only
without
remorse
but
without
regret
he
was
glad
he
had
listened
to
rens
insidious
whispersren
who
could
not
endure
the
captivity
to
which
his
master
might
in
time
have
fallen
a
passive
hopeless
slave
and
yet
who
would
have
faced
a
thousand
years
of
it
rather
than

alonethe
faithful
heart
yes
it
was
good
and
he
was
glad
of
it
or
time
would
not
have
come
when
she
stay
how
old
was
the
child
thenalmost
three
years
and
still
sheltered
and
cherished
by
the
house
of
landalewhen
she
would
return
and
gladden
his
eyes
with
a
living
sight
of
ccile
while
ren
watched
in
his
tower
above

who
had
come
for
the
children
and
where
had
they
been
taken
to
their
motherland
perhaps
even
it
might
have
been
before
he
himself
had
left
it
or
yet
to
ireland
where
still
dwelt
kinsfolk
of
their
blood
probably
it
was
at
the
breaking
up
of
the
family
caused
by
the
death
of
sir
thomas
that
these
poor
little
birds
had
been
removed
from
the
nest
that
had
held
them
so
safe
and
close

was
in
97
in
the
yellow
autumn
of
which
year

embracing
as

oh
the
stealthy
cold
of
that
blank
cheerless
daybreak
how
it
crept
into
the
marrow
of
his
bones
and
chilled
the
little
energy
and
spirits
he
had
left
for
a
whole
year
they
had
fruitlessly
sought
some
english
vessel
to
convey
this
english
gentleman
back
to
his
native
land
he
could
remember
how
at
the
moment
of
separation
from
the
one
friend
who
had
loved
both

forbidding
sides
of

english

home

how
swiftly
the
crafts
had
moved
apart
the
mist
the
greyness
and
desolateness
the
lapping
of
the
waters
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
seamen
all
so
full
of
heartpiercing
associations
to
him
and
the
last
vision
of
rens
simple
face
with
tears
pouring
down
it
and
his
open
mouth
spasmodically
trying
to
give
out
a
hearty
cheer
despite
the
sobs
that
came
heaving
up
to
it
how
little
the
simple
fellow
dreamed
of
what
bitterness
the
future
was
yet
holding
for
his
brother
and
master
to
end
in
these
reunions
at
last
the
vessel
which
had
taken
adrian

on
board
in
answer
to
the
frantic
signals
of
the
fishingsmack
that
had
sailed
from

obviously
to
meet
her
proved
to
be
a
privateer
bound
for
the
west
indies
but
cruising
somewhat
out
of
her
way
in
the
hope
of
outgoing
prizes
from
nantes
the
captain
who
had
been
led
to
expect
something
of
importance
from
the
smacks
behaviour
in
high
dudgeon
at
finding
that
so
much
bustle
and
waste
of
time
was
only
to
burden
him
with
a
mere
castaway
seeking
a
passage
homeone
who
albeit
a
countryman
was
too
ragged
and
disreputable
in
looks
to
be
trusted
in
his
assurances
of
rewardgranted
him
indeed
the
hospitality
of
his
ship
but
on
the
condition
of
his
becoming
a
hand
in
the
company
during
the
forthcoming
expedition
there
was
a
rough
measure
of
equity
in
the
arrangement
and
adrian
accepted
it
the
only
alternative
moreover
would
have
been
a
jump
overboard
and
so
began
a
hard
spell
of
life
but
a
few
shades
removed
from
his
existence
among
the
chouan
guerillas
a
predatory
cruise
lasting
over
a
year
during
which
the
only
changes
rung
in
the
gamut
of
its
purpose
were
the
swooping
down
as
a
vulture
might
upon
unprotected
ships
flying
with
superior
speed
from
obviously
stronger
crafts
engaging
with
hawklike
bravery
everything
afloat
that
displayed
inimical
colours
if
it
offered
an
equal
chance
of
fight
and
this
for
more
than
a
year
until
the
privateer
much
battered
but
safe
despite
her
vicissitudes
made
halifax
for
refitting
here
at
the
first
suitable
port
she
had
touched
adrian
claimed
and
obtained
his
release
from
obligations
which
made
his
life
almost
unendurable
then
ensued
a
period
of
the
most
absolute
penury
unpopular
with
most
of
his
messmates
for
his
melancholy
taciturnity
despised
by
the
more
brutal
as
one
who
had
as
little
stomach
for
a
carouse
as
for
a
bloody
fight
he
left
the
ship
without
receiving
or
even
thinking
of
his
share
of
prizemoney
and
he
had
to
support
existence
with
such
mean
mechanical
employment
as
came
in
his
way
till
an
opportunity
was
offered
of
engaging
himself
as
seaman
again
from
sheer
necessity
on
a
homewardbound
merchantmanan
opportunity
which
he
seized
if
not
eagerly
for
there
was
no
eagerness
left
in
him
yet
under
the
pressure
of
purpose
next
the
long
slowly
plodding
toilsome
seemingly
eternal
course
across
the
ocean
but
even
a
convoy
restricted
to
the
speed
of
its
slowest
member
if
it
escape
capture
or
natural
destruction
must
meet
the
opposite
shore
at
length
and
the
last
year
of
the
century
had
lapsed
in
the
even
race
of
time
when
after
many
dreary
weeks
on
the
first
of
january
1801
the
long
low
lines
of
sandhills
on
the
lancastrian
coast
loomed
in
sight
the
escort
drew
away
swiftly
southwards
as
if
in
joyful
relief
from
the
tedious
task
leaving
the
convoy
to
enter
the
mersey
safe
and
sound
that
evening
adrian
the
roughlooking
and
taciturn
sailor
set
foot
for
a
short
while
on
his
native
land
after
six
years
of
an
exile
which
had
made
of
him
at
five
and
twenty
a
prematurely
aged
and
hopelessly
disillusioned
man
and
sir
adrian
as
he
mused
wrapped
in
the
honoured
fur
cloak
with
eyes
half
closed
by
his
sympathetic
fire
recalled
how
little
of
joy
this
return
had
had
for
him
it
was
the
goal
he
had
striven
to
reach
and
he
had
reached
it
that
was
all
nay
he
recalled
how
when
at
hand
he
had
almost
dreaded
the
actual
arrival
home
dreaded
with
the
infinite
heartsickness
of
sorrow
the
emotions
of
the
family
welcome
to
one
restored
from
such
perils
by
flood
and
fieldif
not
indeed
already
mourned
for
and
forgottenlittle
wotting
how
far
that
return
to
pulwick
that
seemed
near
and
certain
was
still
away
in
the
dim
future
of
life
yet
but
for
the
fit
of
hypochondriacal
humour
which
had
fallen
black
upon
him
that
day
of
deliverance
and
made
him
yearn
with
an
intensity
increasing
every
moment
to
separate
himself
from
his
repugnant
associates
and
haste
the
moment
of
solitude
and
silence
he
might
have
been
rescued
then
and
for
ever
from
the
quagmire
in
which
perverse
circumstances

one
of
his
fellowworkers
to
him
in
a
transient
fit
of
goodfellowship
which
the
prospect
of
approaching
sprees
had
engendered
in
him
even
towards
one
whom
all
on
board
had
felt
vaguely
to
be
of
a
different
order
and
disliked

to

for
a
this
was
the
parting
of
adrian
landale
from
his
fellowworkers
the
idea
of
spending
even
one
night
more
in
that
atmosphere
of
rum
and
filth
in
the
intimate
hearing
of
blasphemous
and
obscene
language
was
too
repulsive
to
be
entertained
and
he
had
turned
away
from
the
offer
with
a
gesture
of
horror
with
half
a
dozen
others
in
whose
souls
the
attractions
of
the
town
at
night
proved
stronger
than
the
fear
of
the
press
party
he
disembarked
on
the
lancashire
side
and
separating
from
his
companions
for
ever
as
he
thought
ascended
the
miserable
lanes
leading
from
the
river
to
the
upper
town
his
purpose
was
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
more
decent
hotels
to
call
the
next
day
for
help
at
the
bankinghouse
with
which
the
landales
had
dealt
for
ages
past
and
thence
to
take
coach
for
pulwick
but
he
had
planned
without
taking
reck
of
his
circumstances
no
hotel
of
repute
would
entertain
this
weatherbeaten
common
sailor
in
the
meanest
of
workstained
clothes
after
failing
at
various
places
even
to
obtain
a
hearing
being
threatened
with
forcible
ejectment
derisively
referred
to
suitable
cribs
in
love
lane
or
tower
street
he
gave
up
the
attempt
and
in
his
usual
dejection
of
spirit
intensified
by
unavowed
and
unreasonable
anger
wandered
through
the
dark
streets
brooding
thus
aimlessly
wandering
the
remembrance
of
his
young
utopian
imaginings
came
back
to
him
to
mock
him
dreams
of
universal
brotherhood
of
equality
of
harmony
he
had
already
seen
the
apostles
of
equality
and
brotherhood
at
workon
the
banks
of
the
vilaine
and
realising
how
he
himself
now
reduced
to
the
lowest
level
in
the
social
scale
hunted
with
insult
from
every
haunt
above
that
level
yet
loathed
and
abhorred
the
very
thought
of
associating
again
with
his
recent
brothers
in
degradation
he
laughed
a
laugh
of
bitter
selfcontempt
but
the
night
was
piercing
cold
and
in
time
the
question
arose
whether
the
stench
and
closeness
of
a
riverside
eatinghouse
would
not
be
more
endurable
than
the
cutting
wind
the
sleet
and
the
sharper
pangs
of
hunger
his
roaming
had
brought
him
once
more
to
that
quarter
of
the
town
best
suited
to
the
likes
of
him
according
to
the
innkeepers
opinion
and
he
found
himself
actually
seeking
a
house
of
entertainment
in
the
slimy
illlighted
narrow
street
when
from
out
the
dimness
running
towards
him
with
bare
feet
paddling
in
the
sludge
came
a
slatternly
girl
with
unkempt
wisps
of
red
hair
hanging
over
her
face
under
the
tartan
shawl
run
run
jack
she
cried
hoarsely
as
she
passed
by
breathless
t
gangs
comin
up
a
sudden
loathly
fear
seized
adrian
by
the
heart
he
too
took
to
his
heels
by
the
side
of
the
slut
with
all
the
swiftness
his
tired
frame
could
muster
im
going
to
warn
my
jo
she
gasped
as
jostling
each
other
they
darted
through
a
maze
of
nameless
alleys
and
then
as
spent
with
running
they
emerged
at
last
into
a
broader
street
it
was
to
find
themselves
in
the
very
midst
of
another
party
of
manofwars
men
whose
brass
beltbuckles
glinted
under
the
flickering
light
of
the
oillamp
swinging
across
the
way
adrian
stopped
dead
short
and
looked
at
the
girl
in
mute
reproach
may
god
strike
me
dead
she
screamed
clapping
her
hands
together
if
i
knew
the
bloody
thieves
were
there
oh
my
bonny
lad
i
meant
to
save
ye
and
as
her
words
rang
in
the
air
two
sailors
had
adrian
by
the
collar
and
a
facetious
bluejacket
seized
her
round
the
waist
with
hideous
bantering
a
very
young
officer
wrapped
up
in
a
cloak
stood
a
few
paces
apart
calmly
looking
on
to
him
adrian
called
out
in
fierce
yet
anguished
expostulation
i
am
a
free
and
independent
subject
sir
an
english
gentleman
i
demand
that
you
order
your
men
to
release
me
for
heavens
sake
he
added
pleadingly
give
me
but
a
moments
private
hearing
a
loud
guffaw
rang
through
the
group
in
truth
if
appearances
make
the
gentleman
adrian
was
then
but
a
sorry
specimen
the
officer
smiledthe
insufferable
smile
of
a
conceited
boy
raised
to
authority
i
can
have
no
possible
doubt
of
your
gentility
sir
he
said
with
mocking
politeness
and
measuring
under
the
glimmering
light
first
the
prisoner
from
head
to
foot
and
then
the
girl
who
scratching
and
blaspheming
vainly
tried
to
make
her
escape
but
sir
as
a
freeborn
english
gentleman
it
will
be
your
duty
to
help
his
majesty
to
fight
his
french
enemies
take
the
english
gentleman
along
my
lads
a
roar
of
approbation
at
the
officers
facetiousness
ran
through
the
party
an
his
mothers
milk
not
dry
upon
his
lips
cried
the
girl
with
a
crow
of
derisive
fury
planting
as
she
spoke
a
sounding
smack
on
a
broad
tanned
face
bent
towards
her
the
little
officer
grew
pink
come
my
men
do
your
duty
he
thundered
in
his
deepest
bass
a
rage
such
as
he
never
had
felt
in
his
life
suddenly
filled
adrians
whole
being
he
was
a
bigger
man
than
any
of
the
party
and
the
rough
life
that
fate
had
imposed
on
him
had
fostered
a
strength
of
limb
beyond
the
common
a
thrust
of
his
knee
prostrated
one
of
his
captors
a
blow
in
the
eye
from
his
elbow
staggered
the
other
the
next
instant
he
had
snatched
away
the
cutlass
which
a
third
was
drawing
and
with
it
he
cleared
for
a
moment
a
space
around
him
but
as
he
would
have
bounded
into
freedom
a
felling
blow
descended
on
his
head
from
behind
a
sheet
of
flame
spread
before
his
eyes
and
behind
this
blaze
disappeared
the
last
that
adrian
landale
was
to
see
of
england
for
another
spell
of
years
when
he
came
back
to
his
senses
he
was
once
more
on
board
shipa
slave
legally
kidnapped
degraded
by
full
and
proper
warrant
from
his
legitimate
status
for
no
crime
that
could
even
be
invented
against
him
a
slave
to
be
retained
for
work
or
war
at
his
masters
pleasure
liable
like
a
slave
to
be
flogged
to
death
for
daring
to
assert
his
light
of
independence





the
memory
of
that
nights
doing
and
of
the
odious
bondage
to
which
it
was
a
prelude
rarely
failed
to
stir
the
gall
of
resentment
in
sir
adrian
men
of
peaceable
instincts
are
perhaps
the
most
prone
to
the
feeling
of
indignation
but
tonight
a
change
had
come
over
the
spirit
of
his
dreams
he
could
think
of
that
past
simply
as
the
pastthe
period
of
time
which
would
have
had
to
be
spent
until
the
advent
of
the
wonderworking
present
these
decrees
of
fate
had
had
a
purpose
had
the
past
by
one
jot
been
different
the
events
of
this
admirable
day
might
never
have
been
the
glowing
edifice
on
the
hearth
collapsed
with
a
darting
of
sudden
flame
and
a
rolling
of
red
cinders
sir
adrian
rose
to
rebuild
his
fire
for
the
night
and
being
once
roused
was
tempted
by
the
ruddiness
of
the
wine
glinting
under
the
quiet
rays
of
the
lamp
to
advance
to
the
table
and
partake
of
his
forgotten
supper
the
calm
atmosphere
the
warmth
and
quiet
of
the
room
in
which
he
broke
his
bread
and
sipped
his
wine
whilst
old
jem
stretched
by
the
hearth
gazed
at
him
with
yellow
upturned
eyes
full
of
lazy
inquiry
concerning
this
departure
from
the
usual
nightly
regularity
the
serene
placidity
of
the
scene
indoors
as
contrasting
with
the
angry
voices
of
elements
without
answered
to
the
peacethe
strange
peacethat
filled
the
mans
soul
even
in
the
midst
of
such
uncongenial
memories
as
now
rose
up
before
him
in
vivid
concatenation
she
was
then
five
years
old
where
was
she
when
he
began
that
seemingly
endless
cruise
with
the
frigate
porcupine
he
tried
to
fancy
a
ccile
five
years
olda
chubby
curlyheaded
mite
nursing
dolls
and
teasing
kittens
whilst
he
was
bullied
and
browbeaten
by
coarse
petty
officers
shunned
and
hated
by
his
messmates
and
flogged
at
length
by
a
tyrannizing
captain
for
obduracybut
he
could
only
see
a
ccile
in
the
spring
of
womanhood
nestling
in
the
armchair
yonder
by
the
fire
and
looking
up
at
him
from
the
folds
of
a
fur
cloak
she
was
seven
years
old
when
he
was
flogged
ah
god
those
had
been
days
and
yet
in
the
lofty
soul
of
him
he
had
counted
it
no
disgrace
and
he
had
been
flogged
again
ay
and
a
third
time
for
that
obstinate
head
that
would
not
bend
that
obstinate
tongue
that
would
persist
in
demanding
restitution
of
liberty
the
life
on
board
the
privateer
had
been
a
matter
of
bargain
he
had
bartered
also
labour
and
obedience
with
the
merchantman
for
the
passage
home
but
the
king
had
no
right
to
compel
the
service
of
a
free
man
she
was
but
twelve
years
old
when
he
was
finally
released
from
thraldomit
had
only
lasted
four
years
after
all
yet
what
a
cycle
for
one
of
his
temper
four
years
with
scarce
a
moment
of
solitudefor
no
shoreleave
was
ever
allowed
to
one
who
openly
repudiated
any
service
contract
four
years
of
a
life
where
the
sole
prospect
of
change
was
in
these
engagements
orgies
of
carnage
so
eagerly
anticipated
by
officers
and
men
alike
including
himself
though
for
a
reason
little
suspected
by
his
companions
but
even
the
historic
seafights
of
the
porcupine
so
far
as
they
affected
adrian
landale
formed
in
themselves
a
chain
of
monotony
it
was
ever
the
same
hurling
of
shot
from
ship
to
ship
the
same
fierce
exchange
of
cutlassthrows
and
pikepushes
between
men
who
had
never
seen
each
other
before
the
same
yelling
and
execrations
sights
sounds
and
smells
ever
the
same
in
horror
the
same
cheers
when
the
enemys
colours
were
lowered
followed
by
the
same
transient
depression
the
cleansing
of
decks
from
stains
of
powder
and
mire
of
human
blood
the
casting
overboard
of
human
bodies
that
had
done
their
lifes
work
broken
waste
and
other
rubbish
for
weeks
adrian
after
would
taste
blood
smell
blood
dream
blood
till
it
seemed
in
his
nausea
that
all
the
waters
of
the
wide
clean
seas
could
never
wash
the
taint
from
him
again
and
before
the
first
horrid
impressions
had
time
to
fade
the
next
occasion
would
have
come
round
again
it
was
not
the
fate
of
adrian
landale
that
either
steel
or
shot
or
splintered
timber
or
falling
tackles
should
put
an
end
to
his
dreary
life
welcome
as
such
an
end
would
have
been
to
him
then
then

but
not
now
remembering
now
his
unaccountable
escape
from
the
destruction
which
had
swept
from
his
side
many
another
whose
eagerness
for
the
fray
had
certes
not
sprung
like
his
own
from
a
desire
to
court
destruction
he
shuddered
and
there
arose
in
his
mind
the
trite
old
adage
man
proposeth
god
had
disposed
otherwise
it
was
not
destined
that
adrian
landale
should
be
shot
on
the
high
seas
any
more
than
he
should
be
drowned
in
the
rolling
mud
of
the
vilainehe
was
reserved
for
this
day
as
a
setoff
to
all
the
bitterness
that
had
been
meted
out
to
him
he
was
to
see
the
image
of
his
dead
love
rise
from
the
sea
once
more
and
meanwhile
his
very
despair
and
sullenness
had
been
turned
to
his
good
it
would
not
be
said
if
history
should
take
count
of
the
fact
that
while
the
lord
of
pulwick
had
served
four
years
before
the
mast
he
had
ever
disgraced
his
name
by
cowardice
whether
such
reasonings
were
in
accordance
even
with
the
most
optimistic
philosophy
sir
adrian
himself
at
other
times
might
have
doubted
but
he
was
tender
in
thought
this
stormy
night
with
the
grateful
relaxation
that
a
happy
break
brings
in
the
midst
of
longdrawn
melancholy
everything
had
been
working
towards
this
endthat
he
should
be
the
lightkeeper
of
scarthey
on
the
day
when
out
of
the
raging
waters
ccile
would
rise
and
knock
and
ask
for
succour
at
his
chamber

pshawraving
again
well
the
child
where
was
she
on
the
day
of
the
last
engagement
of
that
pugnacious
porcupine
in
the
year
1805
when
england
was
freed
from
her
long
incubus
of
invasion
she
was
then
twelve
it
had
seemed
if
nothing
short
of
a
wholesale
disaster
could
terminate
that
incongruous
existence
of
his
the
last
action
of
the
frigate
was
a
fruitless
struggle
against
fearful
odds
after
a
prolonged
fight
with
an
enemy
as
dauntless
as
herself
with
twothirds
of
her
ships
company
laid
low
and
commanded
at
length
by
the
youngest
lieutenant
she
was
tackled
as
the
sun
went
low
over
the
scene
of
a
drawn
battle
by
a
fresh
sail
errant
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
timely
dismasting
on
board
the
newcomer
would
have
been
captured
or
finally
sunk
then
and
there
but
that
fate
was
only
held
in
reserve
for
her
bleeding
and
disabled
she
had
drawn
away
under
cover
of
night
from
her
two
hardhit
adversaries
to
encounter
a
squall
that
further
dismantled
her
and
in
such
forlorn
conditions
was
met
and
finally
conquered
by
the
french
privateer
espoir

that
pounced
upon
her
in
her
agony
as
the
vulture
upon
his
prey
among
the
remainder
of
the
once
formidable
crew
now
seized
and
battened
down
under
french
hatches
was
of
course
adrian
landalehe
bore
a
charmed
life
and
for
a
short
while
the
only
change
probable
in
his
prospects
was
a
return
to
french
prisons
until
such
time
as
it
pleased
heaven
to
restore
peace
between
the
two
nations
but
the
fortune
of
war
especially
at
sea
is
fickle
and
fitful
the
daring
brig
lettre
de
marque
lespoir
de
brest
soon
after
her
unwonted
haul
of
english
prisoners
was
overtaken
herself
by
one
of
her
own
species
the
st
nicholas
of
liverpool
from
whose
swiftness
nothing
over
the
sea
that
had
not
wings
could
hope
to
escape
if
she
chose
to
give
the
chase
again
did
adrian
from
the
darkness
among
his
fellowcaptives
hear
the
familiar
roar
and
crash
of
cannon
fight
the
hustling
and
the
thud
of
leaping
feet
the
screams
and
oaths
of
battle
and
finally
the
triumphant
shouts
of
english
throats
and
he
knew
that
the
frenchman
was
boarded
a
last
ringing
british
cheer
told
of
the
frenchmans
surrender
and
when
he
and
his
comrades
were
once
more
free
to
breathe
a
draught
of
living
air
after
the
deathly
atmosphere
under
hatches
adrian
learned
that
the
victor
was
not
a
manofwar
but
a
freelance
and
conceived
again
a
faint
hope
that
deliverance
might
be
at
hand
it
was
soon
after
this
action
last
of
the
fights
that
adrian
the
peacelover
had
to
pass
through
and
as
the
two
swift
vessels
now
sailing
in
consort
and
under
the
same
colours
cleaved
the
waters
bound
for
the
mersey
that
a
singular
little
drama
took
place
on
board
the
espoir
de
brest
among
the
younger
officers
of
the
english
privateer
who
were
left
in
charge
of
the
prize
was
a
lad
upon
whom
adrians
jaded
eyes
rested
with
a
feeling
of
mournful
sympathy
so
handsome
was
he
and
so
young
so
full
of
hope
and
spirits
and
joy
of
life
of
all
in
fact
of
which
he
himself
had
been
left
coldly
bare
moreover
the
ring
of
the
merry
voice
the
glint
of
the
clear
eye
awakened
in
his
memory
some
fitful
chord
the
key
of
which
he
vainly
sought
to
trace
one
day
as
the
trim
young
lieutenant
stood
looking
across
the
waters
with
his
brave
eager
gaze
that
seemed
to
have
absorbed
some
of
the
bluegreen
shimmer
of
the
element
he
loved
all
unnoting
the
haggard
sailor
at
his
elbow
a
sudden
flourish
of
the
spyglass
which
he
with
an
eager
movement
swung
up
to
bear
on
some
distant
speck
sent
his
watch
and
seals
flying
out
of
his
fob
upon
the
deck
at
adrians
feet
adrian
picked
them
up
and
as
he
waited
to
restore
them
to
their
owner
who
tarried
some
time
intent
on
his
distant
peering
he
had
time
to
notice
the
coat
and
crest
engraved
upon
one
of
the
massive
trinkets
hanging
from
their
black
ribbons
when
at
last
the
officer
lowered
his
telescope
adrian
came
forward
and
saluted
him
with
a
slight
bow
all
unconsciously
as
unlike
the
average
jack
tars
scrape
to
his
superior
as
can
be
well
imagined
am
i
not
he
asked
addressing
in
you
sir
one
of
the
cochranes
of
the
shaws
the
question
and
the
tone
from
a
common
sailor
were
of
course
enough
to
astonish
the
young
man
but
there
must
be
more
than
this
as
adrian
surmised
to
cause
him
to
blush
wax
angry
and
stammer
like
a
very
schoolboy
found
at
fault
speaking
with
much
sharpness
my
name
is
smith
my
man
cried
he
seizing
his
belongings
and
youjust
carry
on
with
that
coiling
and
my
name
sir

adrian
landale
of
pulwick
priory
i
would
like
a
moments
talk
with
you
if
you
will
spare
me
the
time
the
cochranes
of
the
shaws
have
been
friends
of
our
family
for
generations
a
guffaw
burst
from
a
group
of
adrians
mates
working
hard
by
at
this
recurrence
of
what
had
become
with
them
a
standing
joke
but
the
officer
who
had
turned
on
his
heels
veered
round
immediately
and
stood
eyeing
the
speaker
in
profound
astonishment
great
god
is
it
possible
did
you
say
you
were
a
landale
of
pulwick
how
the
devil
came
you
here
then
and
thus
pressgang
was
adrians
laconic
answer
the
lad
gave
a
prolonged
whistle
and
was
lost
for
a
moment
in
cogitation
if
you
are
really
mr
landale
he
began
adding
hastily
as
if
to
cover
an
implied
admissionof
course
i
have
heard
the
name
it
is
well
known
in
lancashireyou
had
better
see
the
skipper
it
must
have
been
some
damnable
mistake
that
has
caused
a
man
of
your
standing
to
be
pressed
the
speaker
ended
with
almost
a
deferential
air
and
the
smile
that
had
already
warmed
adrians
heart
at
the
door
of
the
captains
quarters
he
said
with
the
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
a
curious
error
it
was
you
made
i
assure
you
my
name
is
smithjack
smith
of
liverpool
an
excusable
error
quoth
adrian
smiling
back
for
one
of
your
seals
bear
unmistakably
the
arms
of
cochrane
of
the
shaws
doubtless
some
heirloom
some
intermarriage
no
sir
hang
it
retorted
mr
jack
smith
of
liverpool
his
boyish
face
flushing
again
and
as
he
spoke
he
disengaged
the
trinket
from
its
neighbours
and
jerked
it
pettishly
overboard
i
know
nothing
of
your
shaws
or
your
cochranes
and
then
he
rapped
loudly
at
the
cabindoor
as
if
anxious
to
avoid
further
discussion
or
comment
on
the
subject
the
result
of
the
interview
which
followedinterview
during
which
adrian
in
a
few
words
overcame
the
skippers
scepticism
and
was
bidden
with
all
the
curiosity
men
feel
at
sea
for
any
novelty
to
relate
over
a
bottle
of
wine
the
chain
of
his
adventureswas
his
passing
from
the
forecastle
to
the
officers
quarters
as
an
honoured
guest
on
board
the
st
nicholas
during
the
rest
of
her
cruise
thinking
back
now
upon
the
last
few
weeks
of
his
seagoing
life
sir
adrian
realised
with
something
of
wonder
that
he
had
always
dwelt
on
them
without
dislike
they
were
gilded
in
his
memory
by
the
rays
of
his
new
friendship
and
yet
that
this
young
jack
smith
to
keep
for
him
the
nondescript
name
he
had
for
unknown
reasons
chosen
to
assume
should
be
the
first
man
to
awaken
in
the
misanthropic
adrian
the
charm
of
human
intercourse
was
singular
indeed
one
who
followed
from
choice
the
odious
trade
of
legally
chartered
corsair
who
was
ever
ready
to
barter
the
chance
of
life
and
limb
against
what
fortune
might
bring
in
his
path
to
sacrifice
human
life
to
secure
his
own
end
of
enrichment
well
the
springs
of
friendship
are
to
be
no
more
discerned
than
those
of
love
there
was
none
of
high
or
low
degree
with
the
exception
of
ren
whose
appearance
at
any
time
was
so
welcome
to
the
recluse
upon
his
rock
as
that
of
the
privateersman
and
so
turning
to
his
friend
in
tonights
softened
mood
sir
adrian
thought
gratefully
that
to
him
it
was
that
he
owed
deliverance
from
the
slavery
of
the
kings
service
that
it
was
jack
smith
who
had
made
it
possible
for
adrian
landale
to
live
to
this
great
day
and
await
its
coming
in
peace
the
old
clock
struck
two
and
jem
shivered
on
the
rug
as
the
lightkeeper
rose
at
length
from
the
table
and
sank
in
his
armchair
once
more
visions
of
the
past
had
been
ever
his
companions
now
for
the
first
time
came
visions
of
the
future
to
commingle
with
them
as
if
caught
up
in
the
tide
of
his
visitors
bright
young
life
it
seemed
as
though
he
were

at

of
the

the
shadow
of
death

before
the
disaster
which
was
supposed
to
have
befallen
mademoiselle
molly
de
savenaye
on
scarthey
sands
the
acting
lord
of
pulwick
if
one
may
so
term
mr
rupert
landale
had
received
a
letter
the
first
reading
of
which
caused
him
a
vivid
annoyance
followed
by
profound
reflection
a
slightlybuilt
darkvisaged
man
this
younger
brother
of
sir
adrian
and
vicarious
master
of
his
house
and
lands
like
to
the
recluse
in
his
exquisite
neatness
of
attire
somewhat
like
also
in
the
mould
of
his
features
which
were
however
more
notably
handsome
than
sir
adrians
but
most
unlike
him
in
an
emphasised
artificiality
of
manner
in
a
restless
and
wary
eye
and
in
the
curious
twist
of
a
thin
lip
which
seemed
to
give
hidden
sarcastic
meaning
even
to
the
most
ordinary
remark
as
now
he
sat
by
his
desk
his
straight
brows
drawn
over
his
ambercoloured
eyes
perusing
the
closely
written
sheets
of
this
troublesome
missive
there
entered
to
him
the
long
plaintive
figure
of
his
maiden
sister
who
had
held
house
for
him
under
his
own
minute
directions
ever
since
the
death
in
premature
childbirth
of
his
young
yearwed
wife
miss
landale
the
eldest
of
the
family
had
had
a
disappointment
in
her
youth
as
a
result
of
which
she
now
played
the
ungrateful
rle
of
old
maid
of
the
family
she
suffered
from
chronic
toothache
as
well
as
from
repressed
romantic
aspirations
and
was
the
me
damne
of
rupert
one
of
the
most
melancholy
of
human
beings
she
was
tersely
characterised
by
the
village
folk
as
a
wummicky
poor
thing
at
the
sight
of
mr
landales
weighted
brow
she
propped
up
her
own
long
sallow
face
upon
its
aching
side
with
a
trembling
hand
and
full
of
agonised
prescience
ventured
to
ask
if
anything
had
happened
sit
down
said
her
brother
with
a
sort
of
snarlhe
possessed
an
extremely
irritable
temper
under
his
cool
sarcastic
exterior
a
temper
which
his
peculiar
anomalous
circumstances
whilst
they
combined
to
excite
it
forced
him
to
conceal
rigidly
from
most
and
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
let
it
out
occasionally
upon
sophias
meek
ringleted
head
sophia
collapsed
with
hasty
obedience
into
a
chair
and
then
mr
landale
handed
to
her
the
thin
fluttering
sheets
voluminously
crossed
and
recrossed
with
fine
italian
handwriting

said
rupert
peremptorily
read
it
aloud
and
throwing
himself
back
upon
his
chair
he
shaded
his
mouth
with
one
flexible
thin
hand

sigh
my

will
doubtless
be
astonished

your
invariably
affectionate
behaviour
towards

me
to
believe
that
you
will
also
be
pleased
to
hear
from

lines

the
innocent
elderly
countenance
with
a
dark
look
he
had
sundry
excellent
reasons
other
than
mere
family
affection
for
remaining
on
good
terms
with
his
rich
irish
aunt
but
he
had
likewise
reasons
these
less
obvious
for
wishing
to
pay
his
devoirs
to
her
anywhere
but
under
the
roof
of
which
he
was
nominal
master
she
has
found
it
convenient
to

he
composed
himself
to
listen
while
his
sister
plunged
at
the
letter
and
after
several
false
starts
found
her
place
and
proceeded
since
owing
to
his
most
unfortunate
peculiarity
of
temperament
and
consequent
strange
choice

must

hospitality
for
myself
and

two
young
ladies
now
under
my
charge
the
letter
wavered
in
miss
sophias
hand
and
an
exclamation
hung
upon
her
lip
but
a
sudden
movement
of
ruperts
exquisite
crossed
legs
recalled
her
to
her
task
these
young

cannot
but
have

but
you
may
probably
have
forgotten
even
to
the
very
existence
of
these
charming
young
women
who
were
nevertheless
born
at
pulwick
and
whom
you
must
at
some
time
or
other
have
beheld
as
infants
during
your
excellent
and
lamented
fathers
lifetime
they
are
as
you
are
doubtless
also
unawarefor
i
have
remarked
a
growing
tendency
in
the
younger
generations
to
neglect
the
study
of
genealogy
even
as
it
affects
their
own

with
a
laugh
always
the
same
evidently
the
first
thing
i
remember
about
her
is
her
lecturing
me
on
genealogy
and
heraldry
when
i
wanted
to
go
fishing
till
schoolboy
rampant
as
i
was
i
heartily
wished
her
impaled
and
debruised
on
her
own

for

not

quarters
and

as

her
bewilderment
as
best
she

also

which
nowadays
is

substanceare
personally
entitled
if
i
am
the
sole
relative
they
have
left
in
these
realms
adrian
and
you
are
the
next
i
have
had
the
charge
of
my
two
young
kinswomen
during
the
last
six
months
that
is
since
they
left
the
couvent
des
dames
anglaises
in
jersey
now
i
think
it
is
time
that
your
branch
of
the
family
should
incur
the
share
of
the
responsibility
your
relationship
to
them
entails
if
adrian
were
as
and
where
he
should
be
i
feel
sure
he
would
embrace
this
opportunity
of
doing
his
duty
as
the
head
of
the
house
without
the
smallest
hesitation
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
offer
the
hospitality
of
pulwick
priory
and
his
protection
to
these
amiable
young
persons
for
as
long
as
they
remain
unmarried
from
you
my
dear
nephew
who
have
undertaken
under
these
melancholy
family
circumstances
to
fill
your
brothers
place
i
do
not
however
expect
so
much
all
i
ask
is
that
you
and
my
niece
sophia
be
kind
enough
to
shelter
and
entertain
your
cousins
for
the
space
of
two
months
while
i
remain
at
bath
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
at
my
age
for
it
is
of
no
use
nephew
for
us
to
deny
our
years
when
any
peerage
guide
must
reveal
them
pretty
closely
to
the
curious
and
i
am
this
month
passing
sixtynine
at
my
age
the
charge
of
two
highspirited
young
females
in
whom
conventional
education
has
failed
to
subdue
aspirations
for
worldly
happiness
whilst
it
has
left
them
somewhat
inexperienced
in
the
conventions
of
society
i
find
a
little
trying
it
does
not
harmonise
with
the
retired
peaceful
existence
to
which
i
am
accustomed
and
at
my
time
of
life
i
think
entitled
in
which
it
is
my
humble
endeavour
to
wean
myself
from
this
earth
which
is
so
full
of
emptiness
and
to
prepare
myself
for
that
other
and
better
home
into
which
we
must
all
resign
ourselves
to
enter
and
happy
indeed
my
dear
rupert
such
of
us
as
will
be
found
worthy
for
come
to
it
we
all
must
and
the
longer
we
live
the
sooner
we
may
expect
to
do
so
the
necessity
of
producing
them
in
society
is
however
rendered
a
matter
of
greater
responsibility
by
the
fact
of
the
handsome
fortunes
which
these
young
creatures
possess
already
not
to
speak
of
their
expectations
rupert
who
had
been
listening
to
his
aunts
letter
through
the
intermediary
of
miss
sophias
depressing
singsong
with
an
abstracted
air
here
lifted
up
his
head
and
commanded
the
reader
to
repeat
this
last
passage
she
did
so
and
paused
awaiting
his
further
pleasure
while
he
threw
his
handsome
head
back
upon
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
lost
in
calculations
at
length
he
waved
his
hand
and
miss
sophia
proceeded
after
the
usual
floundering
a
neighbour
of
mine
at
bunratty
mrs
hambledon
of
brianstown
a
lively
widow
herself
one
of
the
macnamaras
of
the
reeks
and
thus
a
distant
connection
of
the
ballinasloe
branch
of
odonoghues
and
whom
i
had
reason
to
believe
i
could
trustbut
i
will
not
anticipatetook
a
prodigious
fancy
to
miss
molly
and
proposed
towards
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
carrying
her
away
to
dublin
at
the
same
time
the
wet
summer
producing
in
me
an
acute
recurrence
of
that
affection
from
which
as
you
know
i
suffer
and
about
which
you
never
fail
to
make
such
kind
enquiries
at
christmas
and
easter
compelled
me
to
call
in
mr
omally
the
apothecary
who
has
been
my
very
obliging
medical
adviser
for
so
many
years
and
who
strenuously
advocated
an
immediate
course
of
waters
at
bath
in
short
my
dear
nephew
thus
the
matter
was
settled
your
cousin
molly
departed
radiant
with
good
spirits
and
good
looks
for
a
spell
of
gayety
in
dublin
while
your
cousin
madeleine
prepared
with
equal
content
to
accompany
her
old
aunt
to
bath
it
being
arranged
with
mrs
hambledon
that
she
should
herself
conduct
molly
to
us
later
on
we
have
been
here
about
three
weeks
though
persuaded
by
good
mr
omally
that
the
waters
would
benefit
my
old
bones
i
was
actuated
i
must
confess
by
another
motive
in
seeking
this
fashionable
resort
in
such
a
place
as
this
thronged
as
it
is
by
all
the
rank
and
family
of
england
one
can
at
least
know
who
is
who
and
i
was
not
without
hopes
that
my
nieces
with
their
faces
their
name
and
their
fortunes
would
have
the
opportunity
of
contracting
suitable
alliances
and
thus
relieve
me
of
a
charge
for
which
i
am
i
fear
little
fitted
but
alas
my
dear
rupert
i
was
most
woefully
mistaken
bath
is
distinctly
not
the
place
for
two
beautiful
and
unsophisticated
heiresses
and
i
am
certainly
neither
possessed
of
the
spirits
nor
of
the
health
to
guard
them
from
fortunehunters
and
needy
nameless
adventurers
while
it
is
my
desire
to
impress
upon
you
and
my
niece
sophia
that
the
conduct
of
these
young
ladies
has
been
quite
beyond
reproach
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
the
attentions
of
a
certain
person
of
the
name
of
smith
known
here
and
a
favorite
in
the
circles
of
frivolity
and
fashion
as
captain
jack
have
already
made
madeleine
conspicuous
and
although
the
dear
girl
conducts
herself
with
the
utmost
propriety
there
is
an
air
of
romance
and
mystery
about
the
young
man
not
to
speak
of
his
unmistakable
good
looks
which
have
determined
me
to
remove
her
from
his
vicinity
before
her
affections
be
irreparably
engaged
as
for
molly
who
is
a
thorough
odonoghue
and
the
image
of
her
grandmother
that
celebrated
murthering
moll
herself
the
toast
of
bath
in
our
young
days
whose
elopement
with
the
marquis
de
kermelgan
after
he
had
killed
an
english
rival
in
a
duel
was
once
a
ninedays
wonder
in
this
very
town
and
of
whom
you
must
have
heard
mrs
hambledon
restored
her
to
my
care
only
three
days
ago
and
she
has
already
twenty
beaux
to
her
string
though
favouring
nobody
i
am
bound
to
say
but
her
own
amusement
yesterday
she
departed
under
mrs
hambledons
chaperonage
in
the
company
of
a
dozen
of
the
highest
in
rank
here
on
an
expedition
to
clifton
the
while
my
demure
madeleine
spends
the
day
at
the
house
of
her
dear
friend
lady
maria
harewood
whither
i
only
learnt
upon
her
return
at
ten
oclock
under
his
escort
captain
jackin
my
days
that
sort
of
captain
would
have
been
strongly
suspected
of
having
a
shade
too
much
of
the
heath
or
the
london
road
about
himhad
likewise
been
convened
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
with
a
great
towrow
a
coach
full
of
very
merry
company
amongst
whom
the
widow
hambledon
struck
me
as
overmerry
perhaps
landed
my
other
miss
sur
le
perron
this
has
decided
me
we
shall
decamp
sans
tambou
ni
trompette
tomorrow
without
allowing
discussion
from
the
girls
in
which
i
should
probably
be
worsted
we
pack
ourselves
into
my
travelling
coach
and
find
our
way
to
you
but
until
we
are
fairly
on
the
road
i
shall
not
even
let
these
ladies
know
whither
we
are
bound
with
your
kind
permission
then
i
shall
remain
a
few
days
at
pulwick
to
recruit
from
the
fatigues
of
such
a
long
journey
before
leaving
your
fair
cousins
in
your
charge
and
in
that
of
the
gentle
sophia
whom
i
trust
to
entertain
them
with
something
besides
her
usual
melancholy
till
the
time
comes
for
me
to
bring
them
back
with
me
to
bunratty
unless
therefore
you
should
hear
to
the
contrary
you
will
know
that
on
tuesday
your
three
unprotected
female
relatives
will
be
hoping
to
see
your
travelling
carriage
arrive
to
fetch
them
at
the
crown
in
lancaster
your
affectionate
aunt
rose
odonoghue
as
miss
landale
sighed
forth
the
concluding
words
she
dropped
the
little
folio
on
her
lap
and
looked
at
her
brother
with
a
world
of
apprehension
in
her
faded
eyes
oh
rupert
what
shall
we
do
do
said
mr
landale
quickly
turning
on
her
out
of
his
absorption
you
will
kindly
see
that
suitable
rooms
are
prepared
for
your
aunt
and
cousins
and
you
will
endeavour
if
you
please
to
show
these
ladies
a
cheerful
countenance
as
your
aunt
requests
the
oak
and
the
chintz
rooms
i
suppose
sophia
timidly
suggested
tanty
used
to
say
she
liked
the
aspect
and
i
daresay
the
young
ladies
will
find
it
pleasant
to
look
out
on
the
garden
ay
returned
rupert
absently
he
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
fallen
to
pacing
the
room
presently
a
short
laugh
broke
from
him
tolerably
cool
i
must
say
he
remarked
tolerably
cool
it
seems
to
be
a
tradition
with
that
savenaye
family
when
in
difficulties
to
go
to
pulwick
miss
landale
looked
up
with
relief
perhaps
rupert
would
think
better
of
it
and
make
up
his
mind
to
elude
receiving
the
unwelcome
visitors
after
all
but
his
next
speech
dashed
her
budding
hopes
ay
as
in
the
days
of
their
mother
before
them
when
she
came
here
to
lay
her
eggs
like
a
cuckoo
in
another

nesti
wish
they
had
been
addled

do
indeedwe
may
expect
to
have
the
whole

turned

it
is

pretty
assortment

incompetence

cried
the
brother
with
a
contained
intensity
of
exasperation
at
which
the
poor
lady
jumped
and
trembled
as
if
she
had
been
struck
all
your
whining
wont
improve
matters
now
listen
to
me
sitting
down
beside

impressively

1814this
day
do
i
molly
de
savenaye
begin
my
diary
madeleine
writes
to
me
from
bath
that
she
has
purchased
a
very
fine
book
in
which
she
intends
to
set
forth
each
evening
all
that
has
happened
her
since
the
morning
she
advises
me
to
do
so
too
she
says
that
since
real
life
has
begun
for
us
life
of
which
every
succeeding
day
is
not
as
in
the
convent
the
repetition
of
the
previous
day
but
brings
some
new
discovery
pleasure
or
pain
we
ought
to
write
down
and
preserve
their
remembrance
it
will
be
so
interesting
for
us
to
read
when
a
new
life
once
more
begins
for
us
and
we
are
married
besides
it
is
the
fashion
and
all
the
young
ladies
she
knows
do
it
and
she
has
she
says
already
plenty
to
write
down
now
i
should
like
to
know
what
about
when
ought
one
to
start
such
a
record
surely
not
on
a
day
like
this
why
demme
as
mrs
hambledons
nephew
says
what
the
deyvil
have
i
got
to
say
item
i
went
out
shopping
this
morning
with
mrs
hambledon
and
bearing
madeleines
advice
in
mind
purchased
at
kellys
in
sackville
street
an
album
book
bound
in
green
morocco
with
clasp
and
lock
which
mr
kelly
protests
is
quite
secure
item
we
met
captain
segrave
of
the
royal
dragoons
who
was
so
attentive
to
me
at
lady
rigtouns
rout
two
days
ago
he
looked
very
well
on
his
charger
but
how
conceited
when
he
saw
me
he
rolled
his
eyes
and
grew
quite
red
and
then
he
stuck
his
spurs
into
his
horse
that
we
might
admire
how
he
could
sit
it
which
he
did
indeed
to
perfection
mrs
hambledon
looked
vastly
knowing
and
i
laughed
if
ever
i
try
to
fancy
myself
married
to
such
a
man
i
cannot
help
laughing
this
however
is
not
diaryitem
we
returned
home
because
it
began
to
rain
and
to
pass
the
time
here
am
i
at
my
book
but
is
this
the
sort
of
thing
that
will
be
of
interest
to
read
hereafter
i
have
begun
too
late
i
should
have
written
in
those
days
when
i
saw
the
dull
walls
of
our
convent
prison
for
the
last
time
it
seems
so
far
back
now
though
by
the
calendar
it
is
hardly
six
months
that
i
cannot
quite
recall
how
it
felt
to
live
in
prison
and
yet
it
was
not
unhappy
and
there
was
no
horror
in
the
thought
we
both
had
sometimes
then
that
we
should
pass
and
end
our
lives
in
the
cage
it
did
not
strike
us
as
hard
it
seemed
indeed
in
the
nature
of
things
but
the
bare
thought
of
returning
to
that
existence
now
to
resume
the
placid
daily
task
to
fold
up
again
like
a
plant
that
has
once
expanded
to
sun
and
breeze
to
have
never
a
change
of
scene
of
impression
to
look
forward
to
nothing
but
submission
sleep
and
death
oh
it
makes
me
turn
cold
all
over
and
yet
there
are
women
who
of
their
own
will
give
up
the
freedom
of
the
world
to
enter
a
convent
after
they
have
tasted
life
oh
i
would
rather
be
the
poorest
the
ugliest
peasant
hag
toiling
for
daily
bread
than
one
of
these
cold
cloistered
souls
so
that
the
free
air
of
heaven
be
it
with
the
winds
or
the
rain
might
beat
upon
me
so
that
i
might
live
and
love
as
i
like
do
right
as
i
like
ay
and
do
wrong
if
i
liked
with
the
free
will
which
is
my
own
we
were
told
that
the
outer
world
with
all
its
sorrows
and
trials
and
dangershow
i
remember
the
reverend
mothers
words
and
face
and
how
they
impressed
me
then
and
how
i
should
laugh
at
them
nowthat
the
world
was
but
a
valley
of
tears
we
were
warned
that
all
that
awaited
us
if
we
left
the
fold
was
misery
that
the
joys
of
this
world
were
bitter
to
the
taste
its
pleasures
hollow
and
its
griefs
lasting
we
believed
it
and
yet
when
the
choice
was
actually
ours
to
make
we
chose
all
we
had
been
taught
to
dread
and
despise
why
i
wonder
for
the
same
reason
as
eve
ate
the
apple
i
suppose
i
would
if
i
had
been
eve
i
almost
wish
i
could
go
back
now
for
a
day
to
the
cool
white
rooms
to
see
the
nuns
flitting
about
like
black
and
white
ghosts
with
only
a
jingle
of
beads
to
warn
one
of
their
coming
see
the
blue
sky
through
the
great
bare
windows
and
the
shadows
of
the
trees
lengthening
on
the
cold
flagged
floors
hear
the
bells
going
dingdong
dingdong
and
the
murmur
of
the
sea
in
the
distance
and
the
drone
of
the
school
and
the
drone
of
the
chapel
to
go
back
and
feel
once
more
the
dull
sort
of
content
the
calmness
the
rest
but
no
no
i
should
be
trembling
all
the
while
lest
the
blessed
doors
leading
back
to
that
horrible
world
should
never
open
to
me
again
the
sorrows
and
trials
of
the
world
i
suppose
the
reverend
mother
really
meant
it
and
if
i
had
gone
on
living
there
till
my
face
was
wrinkled
like
hers
poor
woman
i
might
have
thought
so
too
in
the
end
and
talked
the
same
nonsense
was
it
really
i
that
endured
such
a
life
for
seventeen
years
o
god
i
wonder
that
the
sight
of
the
swallows
coming
and
going
the
sound
of
the
free
waves
did
not
drive
me
mad
twist
as
i
will
my
memory
i
cannot
recall
that
molly
of
six
months
ago
whose
hours
and
days
passed
and
dropped
all
alike
all
lifeless
just
like
the
slow
tac
tac
tac
of
our
great
horloge
in
the
refectory
and
were
to
go
on
as
slow
and
as
alike
for
ever
and
ever
till
she
was
old
dried
wrinkled
and
then
died
the
real
molly
de
savenayes
life
began
on
the
april
morning
when
that
dear
old
turbaned
fairy
godmother
of
ours
carried
us
poor
little
cinderellas
away
in
her
coach
well
do
i
remember
my
birthday
i
have
read
since
in
one
of
those
musty
books
of
bunratty
that
moths
and
butterflies
come
to
life
by
shaking
themselves
out
one
fine
day
from
a
dulllooking
shapeless
ugly
thing
they
call
a
grub
in
which
they
have
been
buried
for
a
long
time
they
unfold
their
wings
and
fly
out
in
the
sunshine
and
flit
from
flower
to
flower
and
they
look
beautiful
and
happythe
world
the
wicked
world
is
open
to
them
there
were
pictures
in
the
book
the
ugly
grub
below
dreary
and
brown
and
the
lovely
butterfly
in
all
its
colours
above
i
showed
them
to
madeleine
and
said
look
madeleine
as
we
were
and
as
we
are
and
she
said
yes
those
brown
gowns
they
made
us
wear
were
ugly
but
i
should
not
like
to
put
on
anything
so
bright
as
red
and
yellow
would
you
that
is
the
worst
of
madeleine
she
never
realises
in
the
least
what
i
mean
and
she
does
love
her
clothes
that
is
the
difference
between
her
and
me
she
loves
fine
things
because
they
are
fine
and
dainty
and
all
thati
like
them
because
they
make
me
fine
and
yet
how
she
did
weep
when
she
left
the
convent
madeleine
would
have
made
a
good
nun
after
all
she
does
so
hate
anything
ugly
or
coarse
she
grows
quite
white
if
she
hears
people
fighting
if
there
is
a
row
or
a
shindy
as
they
say
here
whereas
tanty
and
i
think
it
all
the
fun
in
the
world
and
would
enjoy
joining
in
the
fray
ourselves
i
believe
if
we
dared
i
know
i
should
it
sets
my
blood
tingling
but
madeleine
is
a
real
princess
a
sort
of
ermine
and
yet
she
enjoys
her
new
life
too
the
beauty
of
it
the
refinement
being
waited
upon
and
delicately
fed
and
clothed
but
although
she
has
ceased
to
weep
for
the
convent
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
she
would
be
there
still
the
only
thing
i
believe
that
could
make
me
weep
now
would
be
to
find
one
fine
morning
that
this
had
only
been
a
dream
and
that
i
was
once
more
the
grub
to
find
that
i
could
not
open
my
window
and
look
into
the
wide
wide
world
over
to
the
long
green
hills
in
the
distance
and
know
that
i
could
wander
or
gallop
up
to
them
as
i
did
at
bunratty
and
see
for
myself
what
lies
beyondsurely
that
was
a
taste
of
heaven
that
day
when
tanty
rose
first
allowed
me
to
mount
her
old
pony
and
i
flew
over
the
turf
with
the
wind
whistling
in
my
earsto
find
that
i
could
not
go
out
when
i
pleased
and
hear
new
voices
and
see
new
faces
and
men
and
women
who
live
each
their
own
life
and
not
the
same
life
as
mine
when
i
think
of
what
i
am
now
and
what
i
might
have
remained
i
breathe
deep
and
feel
like
singing
i
stretch
my
arms
out
and
feel
like
flying
our
aunt
told
us
she
thought
bunratty
would
be
dull
for
us
and
so
it
was
in
comparison
with
this
place
perhaps
this
is
dull
in
comparison
with
what
may
come
for
good
tanty
as
she
likes
us
to
call
her
is
intent
on
doing
great
things
for
us
je
vous
marierai
she
tells
us
in
her
funny
old
french
je
vous
marierai
bien
mes
filles
si
vous
tes
sages
and
she
winks
both
eyes
marriage
that
it
is
quite
evident
is
the
goal
of
every
properly
constituted
young
female
and
every
respectable
person
who
has
the
care
of
said
young
female
is
consequently
bent
upon
her
reaching
that
goal
so
marriage
is
another
good
thing
to
look
forward
to
and
love
that
love
all
the
verses
all
the
books
one
reads
are
so
full
of
that
will
come
to
us
they
say
that
love
is
life
well
all
i
want
is
to
live
but
with
a
grey
past
such
as
we
have
had
the
present
is
good
enough
to
ponder
upon
we
now
can
lie
abed
if
we
have
sweet
dreams
and
pursue
them
waking
and
be
lazy
yet
not
be
troubled
with
the
selfindulgence
as
with
an
enormity
or
we
can
rise
and
breathe
the
sunshine
at
our
own
time
we
can
be
frivolous
and
yet
meet
with
smiles
in
response
dress
our
hair
and
persons
and
be
pleased
with
ourselves
and
with
being
admired
or
envied
yet
not
be
told
horrid
things
about
death
and
corruption
and
skeletons
and
above
alloh
above
all
we
can
think
of
the
future
as
different
from
the
past
as
changing
be
it
even
for
the
worse
as
unknown
and
fascinating
not
as
a
repetition
until
death
of
the
same
dreary
round
in
mrs
hambledons
parlour
here
are
huge
glasses
at
either
end
whenever
you
look
into
them
you
see
a
neverending
chain
of
rooms
with
yourself
standing
in
the
middle
vanishing
in
the
distance
every
one
the
same
with
the
same
person
in
the
middle
only
a
little
smaller
a
little
more
insignificant
a
little
darker
till
it
all
becomes
nothing
it
always
reminds
me
of
lifes
prospects
in
the
convent
i
dislike
that
room
when
i
told
mrs
hambledon
the
reason
why
she
laughed
and
promised
me
that
with
my
looks
and
disposition
my
life
would
be
eventful
enough
i
have
every
mind
that
it
shall





october
18thyesterday
i
woke
up
in
an
amazing
state
of
happiness
though
for
no
particular
reason
that
i
can
think
of
it
could
not
be
simply
because
we
were
to
go
out
for
a
visit
to
the
country
and
see
new
people
and
places
for
i
have
already
learned
to
find
that
most
new
people
are
cut
out
on
the
same
pattern
as
those
one
already
knows
it
must
have
been
rather
because
i
awoke
under
the
impression
of
one
of
my
lovely
dreamssuch
dreams
as
i
have
only
had
since
i
left
my
grub
state
dreams
of
space
air
long
long
views
of
beautiful
scenery
always
changing
always
wider
such
as
swallows
flying
between
sky
and
earth
might
see
under
an
exquisite
and
brilliant
light
till
for
very
joy
i
wake
up
my
cheeks
covered
with
tears
this
time
i
was
sitting
on
the
prow
of
some
vessel
with
lofty
white
sails
and
it
was
cutting
through
the
water
blue
as
the
sky
with
wreaths
of
snowlike
foam
towards
some
unknown
shores
ever
faster
and
faster
and
i
was
singing
to
some
one
next
to
me
on
the
prowsome
one
i
did
not
know
but
who
felt
with
mesinging
a
song
so
perfect
so
sweet
though
it
had
no
human
words
that
i
thought
it
explained
all
the
blue
of
the
heaven
the
freshness
of
the
breeze
the
fragrance
of
the
earth
and
why
we
were
so
eagerly
pressing
onwards
i
thought
the
melody
was
such
that
when
once
heard
it
could
never
be
forgotten
when
i
woke
it
still
rang
in
my
ears
but
now
i
can
no
more
recall
it
how
is
it
we
never
know
such
delight
in
waking
hours
is
that
some
of
the
joy
we
are
to
feel
in
heaven
the
music
we
are
to
hear
and
yet
it
can
be
heard
in
this
life
if
one
only
knew
where
to
go
and
listen
and
this
life
is
beautiful
which
lies
in
front
of
us
though
they
would
speak
of
it
as
a
sorrowful
span
not
to
be
reckoned
it
is
good
to
be
young
and
think
of
the
life
still
to
come
every
moment
is
precious
for
its
enjoyment
and
yet
sometimes
i
find
that
one
only
knows
of
a
pleasure
when
it
is
just
gone
one
ought
to
try
and
be
more
awake
at
each
hour
to
the
happiness
it
may
bring
i
shall
try
and
you
my
diary
shall
help
me
this
is
really
no
diarykeeping
it
is
not
a
bit
like
those
one
reads
in
books
it
ought
to
tell
of
other
people
and
the
events
of
each
day
but
other
people
are
really
very
uninteresting
as
for
events
well
so
far
they
are
uninteresting
too
it
is
only
what
they
cause
to
spring
up
in
our
hearts
that
is
worth
thinking
upon
and
that
is
so
difficult
to
put
in
words
that
mostly
i
spend
my
time
merely
pondering
and
not
writing
last
night
mrs
hambledon
took
me
to
the
play
it
was
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
i
was
full
of
curiosity
it
was
a
long
drama
pretty
enough
and
sometimes
very
exciting
but
i
could
see
that
though
the
actress
was
very
handsome
and
mostly
so
unhappy
as
to
draw
tears
from
the
spectators
there
were
people
especially
some
gentlemen
who
were
more
interested
in
looking
at
the
box
where
i
sat
with
mrs
hambledon
indeed
i
could
not
pretend
when
i
found
myself
before
my
glass
that
night
that
i
was
not
amazingly
prettier
than
that
mrs
colebrook
about
whose
beauty
the
whole
town
goes
mad
when
i
recalled
the
heros
ravings
about
his
matildas
eyes
and
cheeks
and
her
foot
and
her
sylphlike
waist
and
her
raven
hair
i
wondered
what
that
young
man
would
say
of
me
if
he
were
my
lover
and
i
his
persecuted
mistress
the
matilda
was
a
pleasing
person
enough
but
if
i
take
her
point
by
point
it
would
be
absurd
to
speak
of
her
charms
in
the
same
breath
with
mine
oh
my
dear
molly
how
beautiful
i
thought
you
last
night
how
happy
i
should
be
were
i
a
dashing
young
lover
and
eyes
like
yours
smiled
on
me
i
never
before
thought
myself
prettier
than
madeleine
but
now
i
do
lovers
love
mistress
bride
they
talked
of
nothing
else
in
the
play
and
it
was
all
ecstasy
in
their
words
and
nothing
but
misery
in
fact
just
as
the
reverend
mother
would
have
had
it
the
young
man
who
played
the
hero
was
a
very
fine
fellow
and
yet
when
i
conceive
him
making
love
to
me
as
he
did
last
night
to
mrs
colebrook
the
notion
seems
really
too
ludicrous
what
sort
of
man
then
is
it
i
would
allow
to
love
me
i
do
not
mind
the
thought
of
lovers
sighing
and
burning
for
me
as
some
do
now
indeed
or
pretend
to
i
like
to
feel
that
i
can
crush
them
with
a
frown
and
revive
them
with
a
smile
i
like
to
see
them
fighting
for
my
favour
but
to
give
a
man
the
right
to
love
me
the
right
to
my
smiles
the
right
to
me
indeed
i
have
yet
seen
none
who
could
make
me
bear
the
thought
and
yet
i
think
that
i
could
love
and
i
know
that
the
man
that
i
am
to
love
must
be
living
somewhere
till
fate
brings
him
to
me
he
does
not
think
of
me
he
does
not
know
of
me
and
neither
of
us
i
suppose
will
taste
life
as
life
is
till
the
day
when
we
meet
camden
place
bath
november
1stbath
at
last
which
must
please
poor
mrs
hambledon
exceedingly
for
she
certainly
did
not
enjoy
the
transit
i
cannot
conceive
how
people
can
allow
themselves
to
be
so
utterly
distraught
by
illness
i
feel
i
can
never
have
any
respect
for
her
again
she
moaned
and
lamented
in
such
cowardly
fashion
was
so
peevish
all
the
time
on
board
the
vessel
and
looked
so
very
begrimed
and
untidy
and
plain
when
she
was
carried
out
on
bristol
quay
the
captain
called
it
dirty
weather
but
i
thought
it
lovely
and
i
dont
think
i
ever
enjoyed
myself
moreexcept
when
captain
segraves
black
douglas
ran
away
with
me
in
phoenix
park
it
was
beautiful
to
see
our
brave
boat
plough
the
sea
and
quiver
with
anger
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
when
it
was
checked
by
some
great
green
wave
then
gather
itself
again
under
the
wind
and
dash
on
to
the
fight
until
it
conquered
and
when
we
came
into
the
river
and
the
sun
shone
once
more
it
glided
on
swiftly
though
looking
just
a
little
tired
for
a
while
until
its
decks
and
sails
were
dry
and
clean
again
and
i
thought
it
was
just
like
a
bird
that
has
shaken
and
plumed
itself
i
was
sorry
to
leave
it
the
captain
and
the
mate
and
the
sailors
who
had
wrapped
me
up
in
their
great
stiff
tarpaulin
coats
and
placed
me
in
a
safe
corner
where
i
could
sit
out
and
look
were
also
sorry
that
i
should
go
but
it
was
good
to
be
with
madeleine
again
and
tanty
donoghue
who
always
has
such
a
kind
smile
on
her
old
wrinkled
face
when
she
looks
at
me
madeleine
was
astonished
when
i
told
her
i
had
loved
the
storm
at
sea
and
when
i
mimicked
poor
mrs
hambledon
she
says
she
also
thought
she
was
dying
so
ill
was
she
on
her
crossing
and
that
she
was
quite
a
week
before
she
got
over
the
impression
it
seems
odd
to
think
that
we
are
sisters
and
twin
sisters
too
in
so
many
things
she
is
different
from
me
she
has
changed
in
manner
since
i
left
her
she
seems
so
absorbed
in
some
great
thought
that
all
her
words
and
smiles
have
little
meaning
in
them
i
told
her
i
had
tried
to
keep
my
diary
but
had
not
done
much
work
and
when
i
asked
to
see
hers
for
a
model
madeleine
blushed
and
said
i
should
see
it
this
day
year
madeleine
is
in
love
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
that
blush
i
fear
she
is
a
sly
puss
but
there
is
such
a
bustle
around
us
and
so
much
to
do
and
see
i
have
no
time
to
make
her
confess
so
i
said
i
would
keep
mine
from
her
for
that
period
also
it
seems
a
long
span
to
look
ahead
what
a
number
of
things
will
happen
before
this
day
year
bath
november
3rdbath
is
delightful
i
have
only
been
here
two
days
and
already
i
am
what
tanty
in
her
oldfashioned
way
calls
the
belle
already
there
are
a
dozen
sparks
who
declare
that
my
eyes
have
shot
death
to
them
this
afternoon
comes
my
lord
of
manningham
nicknamed
king
of
bath
to
drink
a
dish
of
tea
as
he
has
it
with
his
dear
old
friend
miss
odonoghue
tanty
has
been
here
three
weeks
and
he
has
only
just
discovered
her
existence
and
remembered
their
tender
friendship
of
course
i
know
very
well
what
has
really
brought
him
he
is
lord
derehams
grandfather
on
the
mothers
side
and
lord
dereham
who
is
the
son
of
the
duke
of
wells
is
the
catch
as
mrs
hambledon
vows
of
the
fashionable
world
this
year
and
lord
dereham
has
seen
me
twice
and
is
in
love
with
me
but
as
lord
dereham
is
more
like
a
little
white
rat
than
a
man
and
swears
more
than
he
converseswhich
would
be
very
shocking
if
it
were
not
for
his
lisp
which
makes
it
very
funnyneedless
to
say
my
diary
dear
your
molly
is
not
in
love
with
himhe
has
no
chance
and
so
lord
manningham
comes
to
tea
and
tanty
orders
me
to
remain
and
see
her
old
friend
instead
of
going
to
ride
with
the
widow
hambledon
the
widow
hambledon
and
i
are
everywhere
together
and
she
knows
all
the
most
entertaining
people
in
bath
whereas
madeleine
whom
i
have
hardly
seen
at
all
except
at
night
when
i
am
so
dead
tired
that
i
go
to
sleep
as
soon
as
my
head
touches
the
pillow
i
vow
tantys
manner
of
speech
is
catching
miss
madeleine
keeps
to
her
own
select
circle
and
turns
up
her
haughty
little
nose
at
my
friends
so
now
madeleine
is
punished
for
tanty
and
i
have
had
the
honour
of
receiving
the
king
of
bath
and
i
have
been
vouchsafed
the
stamp
of
his
august
approval
my
dear
miss
odonoghue
he
cried
as
i
curtsied
do
my
senses
deceive
me
or
do
i
not
once
more
behold
murthering
moll
i
thought
you
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
likeness
my
niece
is
indeed
a
complete
odonoghue
says
tanty
amazingly
pleased
likeness
maam
cried
the
old
wretch
bowing
again
and
scattering
his
snuff
all
over
the
place
while
i
sweep
him
another
splendid
curtsey
likeness
maam
why
this
is
no
feeble
copy
no
humble
imitation
tis
murdering
moll
herself
and
glad
i
am
to
see
her
again
and
then
he
catches
me
under
the
chin
and
peers
into
my
face
with
his
dim
wicked
old
eyes
and
so
you
are
murdering
molls
daughter
says
he
chuckling
to
himself
ay
she
and
i
were
very
good
friends
my
pretty
child
very
good
friends
and
that
not
so
long
ago
either
ay
mater
pulchra
filia
pulchrior
but
i
happen
to
be
her
granddaughter
please
my
lord
said
i
and
then
i
ran
to
fetch
him
a
chair
for
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
he
was
going
to
kiss
me
but
though
no
one
has
ever
accused
me
of
speaking
too
modestly
to
be
heard
my
lord
had
a
sudden
fit
of
deafness
and
i
saw
tanty
give
me
a
little
frown
while
the
old
thinghe
must
be
much
older
than
tanty
eventottered
into
a
chair
and
went
on
mumbling
i
was
only
a
boy
in
those
days
my
dear
only
a
boy
as
your
good
aunt
will
tell
you
i
can
remember
how
the
bells
rang
the
three
beautiful
irish
sisters
into
bath
and
i
and
the
other
dandies
stood
to
watch
them
drive
by
the
bells
rang
in
the
belles
in
those
days
my
dear
he
he
he
only
we
used
to
call
them
toasts
then
and
your
mother
was
the
most
beautiful
of
the
three
graceswe
christened
them
the
three
gracesand
by
gad
she
led
us
all
a
pretty
dance
ah
my
lord
says
tanty
and
i
could
see
her
old
eyes
gleam
though
her
tone
was
so
pious
i
fear
we
were
three
wild
irish
girls
indeed
lord
manningham
was
too
busy
ogling
me
to
attend
to
her
your
mother
was
just
such
another
as
you
and
she
had
just
such
a
pair
of
dimples
said
he
you
mean
my
grandmother
shouted
i
in
his
ear
just
for
fun
though
tanty
looked
as
if
she
were
on
pins
and
needles
but
he
only
pinched
my
cheek
again
and
went
on
before
she
had
been
here
a
fortnight
all
the
bucks
in
the
town
were
at
her
feet
and
so
was
i
so
was
i
only
by
gad
i
was
too
young
you
know
as
miss
odonoghue
here
will
tell
you
but
she
liked
me
she
used
to
call
me
her
little
manny
i
declare
i
might
have
married
her
only
there
were
family
reasons
and
i
was
such
a
lad
you
know
and
then
jack
waterpark
some
of
us
thought
she
would
have
had
him
in
the
endbeing
an
irishman
and
a
rich
man
and
a
marquis
to
boothe
gave
her
the
name
of
murthering
moll
because
of
her
killing
eyes
young
ladyhe
he
heand
there
was
ned
cuffe
ready
to
hang
himself
for
her
and
jim
denham
and
old
beau
vernon
ay
and
a
score
of
others
and
then
one
night
at
the
assembly
rooms
after
the
dancing
was
over
and
we
gay
fellows
were
all
together
up
gets
waterpark
he
was
a
little
tipsy
my
dear
and
by
gad
i
can
hear
him
speak
now
with
that
brogue
of
his
boys
he
says
its
no
use
your
trying
for
her
any
more
for
by
god
ive
won
her
and
out
of
his
breastpocket
he
pulls
a
little
knot
of
blue
ribbon
your
mother
my
dear
had
worn
a
very
fine
gown
that
evening
with
little
knots
of
blue
ribbon
all
over
the
bodice
of
it
the
words
were
not
out
of
his
mouth
when
ned
cuffe
starts
to
his
feet
as
white
as
a
sheet
its
a
damned
lie
he
cries
and
out
of
his
pocket
he
pulls
another
little
knot
she
gave
it
to
me
with
her
own
hands
he
cried
and
glares
round
at
us
all
and
then
vernon
bursts
out
laughing
and
flourishes
a
third
little
bow
in
our
eyes
and
i
had
one
too
i
need
not
tell
you
and
so
had
all
the
rest
all
save
a
french
fellowi
forget
his
nameand
it
was
he
she
had
danced
with
the
most
of
all
ah
miss
odonoghue
how
the
little
jades
eyes
sparkle
i
warrant
you
have
never
told
her
the
story
for
fear
she
would
want
to
copy
her
mother
in
other
ways
besides
lookshey
well
my
pretty
give
me
your
little
hand
and
then
i
shall
go
onpretty
little
hand
umumum
and
then
he
kissed
my
hand
the
horrid
snuffy
thing
but
i
allowed
it
for
i
did
so
want
to
hear
how
it
all
ended
and
then
and
then
i
said
and
then
my
dear
this
french
fellow
your
papa
he
must
have
beenso
i
suppose
i
must
not
abuse
him
and
he
was
a
very
fine
young
man
after
all
and
a
man
of
honour
as
wellhe
stood
and
cursed
us
all
you
english
fools
he
said
you
braggardscowards
and
he
seized
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
table
and
with
a
sweep
he
dashed
it
at
us
and
ended
by
flinging
the
empty
glass
in
lord
waterparks
face
it
was
the
neatest
thing
you
ever
saw
for
we
all
got
a
drop
except
waterpark
and
he
got
the
glass
i
challenge
you
all
said
the
frenchman
ill
fight
you
one
by
one
and
i
shall
have
her
into
the
bargain
and
so
he
did
my
dear
he
fought
us
all
one
after
the
other
there
were
five
of
us
he
was
a
devil
with
the
sword
but
ned
cuffe
ran
him
through
for
all
thatand
he
was
a
month
getting
over
it
but
as
soon
as
he
could
crawl
again
he
vowed
himself
ready
for
waterpark
and
weak
as
he
was
he
ran
poor
waterpark
through
the
lungs
some
said
jack
spitted
himself
on
his
swordbut
dead
he
was
anyhow
and
monsieur
your
fatherwhat
was
his
name
kermesomethingwas
off
with
your
mother
before
the
rest
of
us
were
well
out
of
bed
fie
fie
my
lord
said
tanty
you
should
not
recall
old
stories
in
this
manner
gad
maam
i
warrant
this
young
lady
is
quite
ready
to
provide
you
with
a
few
new
ones
chuckled
my
lord
and
as
there
was
no
more
to
be
extracted
from
him
but
foolish
old
jokes
and
dreadful
smiles
i
contrived
to
free
my
pretty
little
hand
and
sit
down
demurely
by
tantys
side
like
the
modest
retiring
young
female
i
should
be
but
my
blood
was
dancing
in
my
veinsthe
blood
of
murthering
molldoddering
old
idiot
as
he
is
lord
manningham
is
right
for
once
i
mean
to
take
quite
as
much
out
of
life
as
she
did
that
indeed
is
worth
being
young
and
beautiful
for
we
know
nothing
of
our
family
save
that
both
father
and
mother
were
killed
in
vende
tanty
never
will
tell
us
anything
about
them
except
their
coats
of
arms
and
i
am
afraid
even
to
start
the
subject
for
she
always
branches
off
upon
heraldry
and
then
we
are
in
for
hours
of
it
but
after
lord
manningham
was
gone
i
asked
her
when
and
how
my
grandmother
died
she
died
when
your
mother
was
born
my
dear
said
tanty
she
was
not
as
old
as
you
are
now
and
your
grandfather
never
smiled
again
or
so
they
said
that
sobered
me
a
little
yet
she
lived
her
life
so
well
while
she
did
live
that
i
who
have
wasted
twenty
precious
years
can
find
in
my
heart
rather
to
envy
than
to
pity
my
beautiful
grandmother





november
5thit
is
three
oclock
in
the
morning
but
i
do
not
feel
at
all
inclined
to
go
to
bed
madeleine
is
sleeping
poor
pretty
pale
madeleine
with
the
tears
hardly
dry
upon
her
cheeks
and
i
can
hear
her
sighing
in
her
sleep
i
was
right
she
is
in
love
and
the
gentleman
she
loves
is
not
approved
of
by
tanty
and
the
upshot
of
it
all
is
we
are
to
leave
dear
bath
delightful
bath
tomorrowtoday
ratherfor
some
unknown
penitential
region
which
our
stern
relative
as
yet
declines
to
name
i
am
longing
to
hear
more
about
it
but
tanty
who
though
she
talks
so
much
can
keep
her
own
counsel
better
than
any
woman
i
know
will
not
give
me
any
further
information
beyond
the
facts
that
the
delinquent
who
has
dared
to
aspire
to
my
sister
is
a
person
of
the
name
of
smith
and
that
it
would
not
do
at
all
i
have
not
the
heart
to
wake
madeleine
to
make
her
tell
me
more
though
i
really
ought
to
pinch
her
well
for
being
so
secretivebesides
my
head
is
so
full
of
my
own
day
that
i
want
to
get
it
all
written
down
and
i
shall
never
have
done
so
unless
i
begin
at
the
beginning
yesterday
then
at
3
oclock
in
the
afternoon
lord
derehams
coach
and
four
came
clattering
up
to
our
door
to
call
for
me
mrs
hambledon
was
already
installed
and
lady
soames
and
a
dozen
other
of
the
fashionables
of
bath
my
little
lord
marquis
had
kept
the
box
seat
for
me
at
which
the
other
ladies
even
my
dear
friend
and
chaperon
looked
rather
green
the
weather
was
glorious
and
off
we
went
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
whips
and
i
knew
i
should
enjoy
myself
monstrously
and
so
i
did
but
it
was
the
drive
back
that
was
the
best
of
all
we
never
started
till
near
nine
oclock
and
lord
dereham
insisted
on
my
sitting
beside
him
againat
which
all
the
ladies
looked
daggers
at
me
and
all
the
gentlemen
daggers
at
him
and
then
we
sang
songs
and
tore
along
uphill
and
down
dale
under
the
beautiful
moonlight
through
the
still
air
till
all
at
once
we
found
we
had
lost
our
way
we
had
to
drive
on
till
we
came
to
an
inn
and
we
could
make
inquiries
there
the
gentlemen
opened
another
hamper
of
wine
and
when
we
set
off
again
i
promise
you
they
were
all
pretty
lively
and
most
of
the
ladies
too
for
the
matter
of
that
as
for
me
who
never
drank
anything
but
milk
or
water
till
six
months
ago
i
have
not
learnt
to
like
wine
yet
so
though
i
sipped
out
of
the
glass
to
keep
the
fun
going
i
contrived
to
dispose
of
the
contents
quietly
over
the
side
of
the
coach
when
no
one
was
looking
it
was
a
drive
to
remember
we
came
to
a
big
hill
and
as
we
were
going
down
it
at
a
smart
pace
the
coach
began
to
sway
then
the
ladies
began
to
screech
and
even
the
men
looked
so
scared
that
i
laughed
outright
lord
dereham
was
perfectly
tipsy
and
he
did
not
know
the
road
a
bit
but
he
drove
in
beautiful
style
and
was
extraordinarily
amusing
as
soon
as
the
coach
took
to
swaying
instead
of
slackening
speed
as
they
all
begged
him
he
lashed
the
horses
into
a
tearing
gallop
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
rest
and
cursing
them
with
the
greatest
energy
grinning
with
rage
and
looking
more
like
a
little
white
rat
than
ever
give
me
the
whip
said
i
and
i
shall
whip
the
team
while
you
drive
cuth
me
cried
he
if
you
are
not
worth
the
whole
coachload
a
dozen
times
over
on
we
went
the
coach
rocked
the
horses
galloped
and
i
knew
at
any
moment
the
whole
thing
might
upset
and
i
flourished
my
whip
and
lashed
at
the
steaming
flanks
and
i
never
felt
what
it
was
to
really
enjoy
myself
before
presently
although
we
were
tearing
along
so
fast
the
coach
steadied
itself
and
went
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
this
it
seems
it
would
never
have
done
had
not
lord
dereham
kept
up
the
pace
and
all
the
rest
of
the
drive
his
lordship
wanted
to
kiss
me
i
was
not
a
bit
frightened
though
he
was
drunk
but
every
time
he
grew
too
forward
i
just
flicked
at
the
horses
with
the
whip
and
i
think
he
saw
that
i
would
have
cracked
him
across
the
face
quite
as
readily
if
he
dared
to
presume
no
doubt
a
dozen
times
during
the
day
i
could
have
secured
a
coronet
for
myself
not
to
speak
of
future
strawberry
leaves
as
my
aunt
says
if
i
had
cared
to
but
who
could
think
of
loving
a
man
like
that
he
can
manage
four
horses
and
he
has
shot
two
men
in
a
duel
and
he
can
drink
three
bottles
of
wine
at
a
sitting
and
when
one
tries
to
find
something
more
to
say
for
him
lo
that
is
all
when
we
at
length
arrived
at
camden
place
for
i
vowed
they
must
leave
me
home
the
first
there
was
the
rarest
sport
my
lords
grooms
must
set
to
blow
the
horns
for
they
were
as
drunk
as
their
master
while
one
of
the
gentlemen
played
upon
the
knocker
till
the
whole
crescent
was
aroused
then
the
doors
opened
suddenly
and
tanty
appears
on
the
threshold
holding
a
candle
her
turban
was
quite
crooked
with
the
birds
of
paradise
over
one
eye
and
i
never
saw
her
old
nose
look
so
hooked
all
the
gentlemen
set
up
a
shout
and
sir
thomas
wrexham
began
to
crow
like
a
cock
for
no
reason
on
earth
that
i
can
think
of
the
servants
were
holding
up
lanterns
but
the
moon
was
nigh
as
bright
as
day
tanty
just
looked
round
upon
them
one
after
another
and
in
spite
of
her
crooked
turban
i
think
they
all
grew
frightened
then
she
caught
hold
of
me
and
just
whisked
me
behind
her
next
she
spied
out
mrs
hambledon
who
had
been
asleep
inside
the
coach
and
now
tumbled
forth
yawning
and
gaping
and
so
madam
cries
tanty
to
her
not
very
loud
but
in
a
voice
that
made
even
me
tremble
so
madam
this
is
how
you
fulfil
the
confidence
i
placed
in
you
a
pretty
chaperon
you
are
to
have
the
charge
of
a
young
lady
though
indeed
considering
your
years
madam
i
might
have
been
justified
in
trusting
you
mrs
hambledon
cut
short
in
the
middle
of
a
loud
yawn
by
this
attack
was
a
sight
to
see
hoightytoighty
maam
she
cried
indignantly
as
soon
as
she
could
get
her
voice
heres
a
fine
todo
it
is
my
fault
of
course
that
lord
dereham
should
mistake
the
road
and
my
fault
too
no
doubt
that
your
miss
should
make
an
exhibition
of
herself
riding
on
the
box
with
the
gentlemen
at
this
hour
of
night
when
i
implored
her
to
come
inside
with
me
were
it
only
for
the
sake
of
common
female
propriety
common
female
indeed
echoed
tanty
with
a
snort
the
poor
child
knew
better
cuth
the
old
cats
theyll
have
each
otherth
eyeth
out
here
cried
my
lord
marquis
interposing
his
little
tipsy
person
between
them
he
had
scrambled
down
the
box
after
me
and
was
listening
with
an
air
of
profound
wisdom
that
made
me
feel
fit
to
die
laughing
dont
you
mind
her
old
lady
he
went
on
addressing
tanty
mith
molly
ith
quite
able
to
take
care
of
herselfdamme
if
sheth
not
aunt
donoghue
turned
upon
him
majestically
and
then
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
you
my
poor
young
man
she
exclaimed
and
i
vow
he
looked
as
sobered
as
if
she
had
flung
a
bucket
of
cold
water
over
him
upon
this
she
retired
and
shut
the
door
and
marched
me
upstairs
before
her
without
a
word
before
my
room
door
she
stopped
mrs
dempsey
has
already
packed
your
sisters
trunks
she
said
in
a
very
dry
way
and
she
will
begin
to
pack
yours
earlyi
was
going
to
say
tomorrowbut
you
keep
such
hours
my
dearit
will
be
today
i
stared
at
her
as
if
she
had
gone
mad
you
and
your
sister
she
went
on
have
got
beyond
me
i
have
taken
my
resolution
and
given
my
orders
and
there
is
not
the
least
use
making
a
scene
and
then
it
came
out
about
madeleine
at
first
i
thought
i
would
go
into
a
great
passion
and
refuse
to
obey
but
after
a
minute
or
two
i
saw
it
was
as
she
said
no
use
tanty
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
then
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
mollify
her
if
i
could
cry
but
i
couldnt
pump
up
a
tear
i
never
can
and
at
last
when
i
went
into
my
room
and
saw
poor
madeleine
who
has
cried
herself
to
sleep
evidently
i
understood
that
there
was
nothing
for
us
but
to
do
as
we
were
told
and
now
i
can
hear
tanty
fussing
about
her
room
stillshe
has
been
writing
toocra
cra
crathis
last
hour
i
wonder
who
to
after
all
there
is
some
fun
in
being
taken
off
mysteriously
we
dont
know
where
i
should
like
to
go
and
kiss
her
but
she

no

having
reached

odonoghues
letter
of
invoice
as
mr
landale
facetiously
described
it
he
drove
over
to
lancaster
on
the
day
appointed
to
meet
the
party
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
through
the
irresistible
management
of
miss
odonoghue
who
put
into
the
promotion
of
her
scheme
all
the
energy
belonging
to
her
branch
of
the
family
together
with
the
long
habit
of
authority
of
the

the
daughters
of
ccile
de
savenaye
returned
to
that
first
home
of
theirs
of
which
they
had
forgotten
even
the
name
mr
landale
had
not
set
eyes
on
his
valuable
relative
for
many
years
but
her
greeting
at
the
first
renewal
of
intercourse
which
took
place
in
the
principal
parlour
of
the
lancaster
inn
was
as
easily
detached
in
manner
as
though
they
had
just
met
again
after
a
trifling
absence
and
she
was
bringing
her
charges
to
his
house
in
accordance
with
a
mutual
agreement
my
dear
rupert
cried
she
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
i
need
not
ask
you
how
you
are
you
look
so
extremely
sleek
and
prosperous
adrians
wide
acres
are
succulent
hey
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
though
to
be
sure
you
are
hardly
large
enough
for
the
breed
you
have
the
true
landale
stamp
on
you
the
unmistakable
landale
style
of
feature
semper
eadem
in
that
sense
at
least
one
can
apply
your
ancient
and
once
worthy
motto
to
you
and
you
know
nephew
since
you
have
conveniently
changed
your
faith
both
to
god
and
king
this
sentiment
strikes
one
as
a
sarcasm
amidst
the
achievements
of
landale
you
backsliders
ah
we
odonoghues
have
better
maintained
our
device
sans

to
whom
the
wellknown
volubility
of
his

disagreeable

who
had
nevertheless
saluted

stalwart

with
much
affection
here
bent
his
supple
back
with
a
sort

dear
keep
it
for
the
young
things
and
indeed
i
see
the
sheeps
eyes
you
have
been
casting
in
their
direction
come
nearer
young
ladies
and
make
your
cousins
acquaintance
beckoning
to
her
nieces
who
arrayed
in
warm
travelling
pelisses
and
beaver
bonnets
of
fashionable
appearance
stood
in
the
background
near
the
fireplace
they
are
very
like
are
they
not
she
continued
twins
always
are
as
like
as
two
peas
and
yet
these
are
as
different
as
day
and
night
when
you
come
to
know
them
madeleine
is
the
eldest
that
is
she
in
the
beaver
fur
molly
prefers
bear
without
their
bonnets
you
will
distinguish
them
by
their
complexion
molly
has
raven
hair
she
is
the
truest
odonoghue
whilst
madeleine
is
fair
blonde
like
her
breton
father
the
sisters
greeted
their
newfound
guardian
each
in
her
own
way
and
in
spite
of
the
disguising
bonnets
and
their
surprising
similarity
of
voice
height
and
build
the
difference
was
more
marked
than
that
of
beaver
and
bear
madeleine
acknowledged
her
kinsmans
greeting
with
a
dainty
curtsey
and
little
halfshy
smile
marked
by
that
air
of
distinction
and
breeding
which
was
her
peculiar
characteristic
molly
however
who
thought
she
had
reasonable
cause
for
feeling
generally
exasperated
and
who
did
not
see
in
mr
rupert
landale
despite
his
good
looks
and
his
good
manner
a
very
promising
substitute
for
her
bath
admirers
nor
in
the
prospect
of
pulwick
a
profitable
exchange
for
bath
came
forward
with
her
bolder
grace
to
flounce
him
a
saucy
reverence
measuring
him
the
while
with
a
certain
air
of
mockery
which
his
thinskinned
susceptibility
was
quick
to
seize
he
looked
back
at
her
down
the
long
tunnel
of
her
bonnet
appraising
the
bloom
and
beauty
within
with
cold
and
curious
gaze
and
then
he
turned
to
madeleine
and
made
to
her
his
courteous
speech
of
welcome
this
was
sufficient
for
miss
molly
who
for
six
months
already
accustomed
to
compel
admiration
at
first
sight
from
all
specimens
of
the
male
sex
that
came
across
her
path
instantly
vowed
a
deadly
hatred
to
her
cousin
and
followed
the
party
into
the
landale
family
coachrupert
preceding
with
a
lady
on
each
armin
a
temper
as
black
as
her
own
locks
it
fell
to
her
lot
to
sit
beside
the
objectionable
relative
on
the
back
seat
while
by
the
right
of
her
minutes
seniority
madeleine
sat
beside
tanty
in
the
front
the
projecting
wings
of
her
headgear
effectively
prevented
her
from
watching
his
demeanour
unless
indeed
she
had
turned
to
him
which
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
but
certain
fugitive
conscious
blushes
upon
the
young
face
in
front
of
her
certain
castings
down
of
long
lashes
and
timid
upward
glances
made
molly
shrewdly
conjecture
that
mr
landale
through
all
the
apparent
devotion
with
which
he
listened
to
tantys
continuous
flow
of
observations
was
able
to
bestow
a
certain
amount
of
attention
upon
her
pretty
neighbour
tanty
herself
conducted
the
conversation
with
her
usual
high
hand
feigning
utter
oblivion
of
the
thundercloud
on
mollys
countenance
and
if
somewhat
rambling
in
her
discourse
nevertheless
contriving
to
plant
her
points
where
she
chose
thus
the
long
drive
wore
to
its
end
the
sun
was
golden
upon
pulwick
when
the
carriage
at
length
drew
up
before
the
portico
miss
sophia
received
them
in
the
hall
in
a
state
of
painful
flutter
and
timidity
she
had
a
constitutional
terror
of
her
aunts
sharp
eyes
and
though
she
examined
her
young
cousins
wistfully
madeleines
unconscious
air
of
dignity
repelled
her
as
much
as
mollys
deliberate
pertness
rupert
conducted
his
aunt
upstairs
and
down
the
long
echoing
corridor
towards
her
apartment
ha
my
old
quarters
quoth
tanty
disengaging
herself
briskly
from
her
escort
to
enter
the
room
and
look
round
approvingly
and
very
comfortable
they
are
and
my
two
nieces
are
next
door
i
see
as
gay
as
chintz
can
make
them
thank
you
nephew
i
shall
keep
you
no
longer
we
shall
dine
shortly
i
feel
sure
well
well
i
do
not
pretend
i
am
not
quite
ready
to
do
justice
to
your
excellent
farebeyond
doubt
it
will
be
excellent
go
to
your
room
girls
your
baggage
is
coming
up
you
see
i
shall
send
dempsey
to
assist
you
presently
no
not
you
sophia
i
was
speaking
to
the
young
ones
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
chat
with
you
my
dear
if
you
have
no
objection
one
door
closed
upon
rupert
as
he
smiled
and
bowed
himself
out
the
other
upon
molly
hustling
her
sister
before
her
tanty
in
the
highest
good
humour
having
accomplished
her
desire
and
successfully
established
a
lodgment
to
use
a
military
term
not
inappropriate
to
such
a
martial
spirit
for
her
troublesome
nieces
in
the
stronghold
of
pulwick
once
more
surveyed
her
surroundings
the
dim
old
walls
the
great
fourpost
bed
consecrated
of
course
by
tradition
to
the
memory
of
some
royal
slumberer
the
damask
hangings
and
the
uncomfortable
chairs
with
the
utmost
favour
ending
up
with
a
humorous
examination
of
the
elongated
figure
hesitating
on
the
hearthrug
be
seated
sophia
i
am
glad
to
stretch
my
old
limbs
after
that
terrible
drive
so
here
we
are
together
again
what
are
you
sighing
for
upon
my
soul
you
are
the
same
as
ever
i
see
the
same
tombstone
on
your
chest
and
blowing
yourself
out
with
sighs
just
as
you
used
that
will
never
give
you
a
figure
my
poor
girl
it
is
no
wonder
you
are
but
skin
and
bones
ah
cant
you
let
the
poor
fellow
rest
in
his
grave
sophia
it
is
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
i
call
it
to
go
on
perpetually
stirring
up
his
ashes
like
that
i
hope
you
mean
to
try
and
be
a
little
more
cheerful
with
those
poor
girls
but
there
i
believe
you
are
never
so
happy
as
when
you
are
miserable
and
its
a
poor
creature
you
would
be
at
any
time
added
the
old
lady
to
herself
after
a
second
thoughtful
investigation
of
miss
landales
countenance
which
had
assumed
an
expression
of
mulishness
in
addition
to
an
increase
of
dolefulness
during
this
homily
here
to
miss
landales
great
relief
the
dying
sunset
wavering
into
crimson
and
purple
from
its
first
glory
of
liquid
gold
attracted
her
aunts
attention
and
miss
odonoghue
went
over
to
the
window
beneath
her
spread
the
quaint
garden
with
its
clipped
box
edges
and
beyond
the
now
leafless
belt
of
trees
upon
the
glimmer
of
the
bay
the
outline
of
scarthey
a
dark
silhouette
rose
fantastically
against
the
vivid
sky
even
as
she
gazed
there
leapt
upon
its
fairy
turret
a
minute
point
of
white
the
jovial
old
countenance
changed
and
darkened
and
adrian
is
still
at
his
fools
game
over
there
i
suppose
she
said
irately
turning
upon
sophia
when
have
you
seen
him
last
how
often
does
he
come
here
i
gather
master
rupert
is
nothing
if
not
the
master
why
dont
you
answer
me
sophia





the
dinner
was
as
well
cooked
and
served
a
meal
as
any
under
ruperts
rule
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
and
if
the
young
ladies
failed
to
appreciate
the
floating
island
the
golden
nests
and
silver
web
so
thoughtfully
provided
for
them
tanty
did
ample
justice
to
the
venison
indeed
the
cloud
which
had
been
visible
upon
her
countenance
at
the
beginning
of
dinner
and
which
according
to
that
downright
habit
of
mind
which
rendered
her
so
terrible
or
so
delightful
a
companion
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
began
to
lift
towards
the
first
remove
and
altogether
vanished
over
her
final
glass
of
port
after
dinner
she
peremptorily
ordered
her
grandnieces
into
the
retirement
of
their
bedchambers
unblushingly
alleging
their
exhausted
condition
in
front
of
the
perfect
bloom
of
their
beautiful
young
vigour
she
then
over
a
cup
of
tea
luxuriously
stretching
her
thin
frame
in
the
best
armchair
the
drawingroom
could
afford
gave
rupert
a
brief
code
of
directions
as
to
the
special
attentions
and
care
she
desired
to
be
bestowed
upon
her
wards
during
their
residence
at
pulwick
descanting
generously
upon
their
various
perfections
gliding
dexterously
over
her
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
rid
of
them
herself
and
concluding
with
the
hinteither
pregnant
or
barren
of
meaning
as
he
chose
to
take
itthat
if
he
made
their
stay
pleasant
to
them
she
would
not
forget
the
service
then
as
mr
landale
began
with
apparent
guilelessness
to
put
a
few
little
telling
questions
to
her
anent
the
episodes
which
had
made
bath
undesirable
as
a
residence
for
these
young
paragons
the
old
lady
suddenly
became
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
and
sleepiness
and
professed
herself
ready
to
be
conducted
to
her
bower
immediately





meanwhile
despite
the
moue
de
circonstance
which
molly
thought
it
incumbent
on
her
to
assume
neither
she
nor
madeleine
regretted
their
compulsory
withdrawal
from
the
social
circle
downstairs
madeleine
had
her
own
thoughts
to
follow
up
and
that
these
were
both
engrossing
and
pleasant
was
easily
evident
and
molly
bursting
with
a
sense
of
injury
arising
from
many
causes
desired
a
special
explanation
with
her
sister
which
the
presence
in
and
out
upon
them
of
tantys
woman
had
prevented
her
from
indulging
in
before
dinner
so
here
we
are
at
last
cried
she
indignantly
after
she
had
walked
round
and
severely
inspected
her
quarters
pausing
to
pull
a
lip
of
extreme
disfavour
at
the
handsome
portrait
of
mr
landale
that
hung
between
the
windows
we
are
madeleine
at
last
kidnapped
imprisoned
successfully
disposed
of
in
fact
yes
here
we
are
at
last
echoed
madeleine
abstractedly
warming
her
slender
ankles
by
the
fire
have
you
made
out
yet
what
particular
kind
of
new
frenzy
it
was
that
seized
chre
tante
asked
miss
molly
with
great
emphasis
as
she
sat
down
at
her
toilettable
you
are
the
cause
of
it
all
my
dear
and
so
you
ought
to
know
it
is
all
very
well
for
tanty
to
pretend
that
i
have
brought
it
on
myself
by
not
coming
home
till
three
oclock
as
if
that
was
my
fault
she
cannot
blink
the
fact
that
her
dempsey
creature
had
orders
to
pack
my
boxes
before
bedtime
your
smith
must
be
a
desperately
dangerous
individual
well
she
continued
looking
round
over
her
shoulder
why
dont
you
say
something
you
lackadaisical
thing
but
madeleine
answered
nought
and
continued
gazing
while
only
the
little
smile
tilting
the
corners
of
her
lips
betrayed
that
she
had
heard
the
petulant
speech
the
smile
put
the
finishing
touch
to
mollys
righteous
anger
brandishing
a
hairbrush
threateningly
she
marched
over
to
her
sister
and
looked
down
upon
the
slender
figure
in
its
clinging
white
dress
with
blazing
eyes
look
here
she
cried
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
i
can
put
up
with
your
slyness
no
longer
how
dare
you
have
secrets
from
me
missyour
own
twin
sister
you
and
i
who
used
never
to
have
a
thought
we
did
not
share
how
dare
you
have
a
lover
and
not
tell
me
all
about
him
what
was
the
meaning
of
your
weeping
like
a
fountain
all
the
way
from
bath
to
shrewsbury
and
then
without
rhyme
or
reason
apparently
smiling
to
yourself
all
the
way
from
there
to
lancaster
you
have
had
a
letter
dont
attempt
to
deny
it
it
is
of
no
use
oh
it
is
base
of
you
it
is
indeed
and
to
think
that
it
is
all
through
you
that
i
am
forced
into
this
exile
through
your
airs
penchs
and
your
sighing
and
dreaming
and
your
mysterous
smith
to
think
that
tonight
this
very
night
is
the
ball
of
the
season
and
we
are
going
to
bed
oh
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
with
nothing
but
a
knave
and
a
fool
to
keep
us
companyfor
i
dont
think
much
of
your
female
cousin
madeleine
and
as
for
your
male
cousin
i
perfectly
detest
himand
all
the
tabbies
of
the
countryside
for
diversion
with
perhaps
a
country
buck
on
high
days
and
holidays
for
a
relish

almost

her
energetic
nature
could
throw
off
most
unpleasant
emotions
easily
enough
so
long
as
it
might
have
an
outlet
for
them
she
now
laid
down
the
threatening
brush
and
kneeling
beside
her
flung
both
her
arms
round
madeleines
shoulders
ma
petite
madeleine
she
coaxed
in
the
mother
tongue
tell
thy
little
sister
thy
secrets
a
faint
flush
crept
to
madeleines
usually
creamy
cheeks
a
light
into
her
eyes
she
turned
impulsively
to
the
face
near
hers
then
as
if
bethinking
herself
pursed
her
lips
together
and
shook
her
head
slightly
do
you
remember
ma

she
said
at
last
that
french

in
which
it
is
said

asked
molly
eagerly
her
lips
parted
as
if
to
drink
in
the
expected
confidence
well
replied
the
other
well
perhaps
things
may
not
be
so
bad
after
all
perhaps
rising
from
her
seat
and
looking
at
her
sister
with
a
little
gentle
malice
while
she
too
began
to
disrobe
her
fairer
beauty
for
the
night
some
of
your
many
lovers
may
come
after
you
from
bath
oh
molly
with
a
little
scream
for
molly
with
eyes
flashing
once
more
had
sprung
up
from
her
knees
to
inflict
a
vicious
pinch
upon
the
equivocators
arm
yes
miss
you
shall
be
pinched
till
you
confess
then
flouting
her
with
a
sudden
change
of
mood
i
am
sure
i
dont
want
to
know
your
wonderful
secretseizing
her
comb
and
passing
it
crackling
through
her
hair
with
quite
unnecessary
energymademoiselle

anyhow
it
cannot
be
very
interesting
mrs

fancy
caring
for
a
man
called

if
you
smile
again
like
that
madeleine
i
shall
beat
you
the
two
sisters
looked
at
each
other
for
a
second
as
if
hesitating
on
the
brink
of
anger
and
then
both
laughed
never
mind
i
shall
pay
you
out

quoth
molly
tugging
at
her
black
mane
so
our
lovers
are
to
come
after
us
is
that
it
do
you
know
madeleine
she
went
on
calming
down
i
almost
regret
now
that
i
would
not
listen
to
young
lord
dereham
simpleton
though
he
be
he
looked
such
a
dreadful
little
fright
that
i
only
laughed
at
him
i
should
have
laughed
at
him
all
my
life
but
it
would
perhaps
have
been
better
than
this
dependence
on
tanty
with
her
sudden
whims
and
scampers
and
whisking
of
us
away
into
the
wilderness
then
i
should
have
had
my
own
way
always
now
its
too
late
tanty
told
me
yesterday
that
she
sees
he
is
a
dissolute
young
man
and
that
his
dukedom
is
only
a
charles
ii
creation
and
we
know
what
that
means
she
added
and
shook
her
head
i
am
sure
i
had
not
a
notion
but
i
shook
my
head
too
and
said
of
course
that
made
it
impossible
i
was
really
afraid
she
would
want
me
to
marry
him
she
was
dreadfully
pleased
and
said
i
was
a
true
odonoghue
oh
dear
i
dont
know
anything
about
love
i
cant
imagine
being
in
love
but
one
thing
is
certain
i
could
never
never
never
allow
a
horrid
little
rat
like
lord
dereham
to
make
love
to
me
to
kiss
me
nor
indeed
any
manoh
horror
how
you
are
blushing
my
dear
come
here
into
the
light
it
would
be
good
for
your
soul
indeed
it
would
to
confess
but
madeleine
burying
her
hot
cheeks
in
her
sisters
neck
and
clasping
her
with
gentle
caresses
was
not
to
be
drawn
from
her
reticence
molly
pushed
her
off
at
last
and
gave
a
hard
little
goodnight
kiss
like
a
birdpeck
very
well
but
you
might
as
well
have
confessed
for
i
shall
find
out
in
the
long
run
and
who
knows
perhaps
you
may
be
sorry

day
that
you

presentment
the
gallery
of
family
portraits
at
pulwick
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
that
ancient
house
it
was
a
custom
firmly
established
at
the
prioryever
since
the
first
heralds
visitation
in
lancashire
when
some
mooted
point
of
claims
to
certain
quarterings
had
been
cleared
in
an
unexpected
way
by
the
testimony
of
a
wellauthenticated
ancestral
portraitfor
each
successive
representative
to
add
to
the
collection
one
of
the
first
cares
of
every
landale
therefore
on
succeeding
to
the
title
was
to
be
painted
with
his
proper
armorial
and
otherwise
distinguishing
honours
jealously
delineated
and
thus
hung
in
the
place
of
honour
over
the
high
mantelshelf
of
the
gallerydisplacing
on
the
occasion
his
own
immediate
and
revered
predecessor
the
chain
was
consequently
unbroken
from
the
elizabethan
descendants
of
the
first
acquirers
of
ecclesiastical
property
at
pulwick
down
to
the
present

the
late
sir

appeared
in
all
the
majesty
of
deputylieutenant
colonel
of
militia
magistrate
and
sundry
other
honourable
offices
in
his
due
place
on
the
right
of
the
present
baronet
the
latter
figured
in
a
character
so
strange
and
so
incongruous
that
it
seemed
as
if
one
day
the
dignified
array
of
landalesold
young
middleaged
but
fine
gentlemen
all
of
themmust
turn
their
backs
upon
their
degenerate
kinsman

the
chimneypiece
in
the
huge
carvedoak
frame

already
two
centuries
old

piping
of

with
pigtail
and
coarse
open
shirtstood
boldly
forth
as
the
representative
of
the
present
owner
of
pulwick
proud
of
their
long
line
of
progenitors
it
was
a
not
unusual
thing
for
the
landales
to
entertain
their
guests
at
breakfast
in
a
certain
sunny
bowwindow
in
the
portrait
gallery
rather
than
in
the
breakfast
parlour
proper
which
in
winter
unmistakably
harboured
more
damp
than
was
pleasant
it
was
therefore
with
no
surprise
that
miss
landale
received
an
early
order
from
her
brother
to
have
a
fire
lighted
in
the
apartment
sacred
to
the
family
honours
and
the
matutinal
repast
served
there
in
due
course
whether
mr
landale
was
actuated
by
a
regard
for
the
rheumatism
of
his
worthy
relative
or
merely
a
natural
family
pride
or
by
some
other
and
less
simple
motive
he
saw
no
necessity
for
informing
his
docile
housewife
on
the
matter
as
sophia
was
accustomed
to
no
such
condescension
on
his
part
even
in
circumstances
more
extraordinary
she
merely
bundled
out
of
bed
unquestioningly
in
the
darkness
and
cold
of
the
morning
to
see
his
orders
executed
in
the
proper
manner
which
indeed
to
her
credit
was
so
successfully
accomplished
that
tanty
and
her
charges
when
they
made
their
entry
upon
the
scene
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
with
the
comfortable
aspect
of
the
majestic
old
room
mr
landale
examined
his
two
young
uninvited
guests
with
new
keenness
in
the
morning
light
molly
was
demure
enough
though
there
was
a
lurking
gleam
in
her
dark
eye
which
suggested
rather
armed
truce
than
accepted
peace
as
for
madeleine
though
to
be
serene
was
an
actual
necessity
of
her
delicate
nature
there
was
more
than
resignation
in
the
blushing
radiance
of
her
look

smile

rupert
bringing
his
critical
survey
to

close
and
stepping
forward
with
a
nice
action

treacherous
memory
of
a
schoolboy
for
the
impressionbut
portraits
by
different
masters
and
in
different
moods
there
was
something
patronising
in
the
tone
from
so
young
a
man
which
molly
resented
on
the
spot
oh
we
should
be
as
like
as
two
peas
only
that
we
are
as
different
as
day
and
night
as
tanty
says
she
retorted
tossing
her
white
chin
at
her
host
while
miss
odonoghue
laughed
aloud
at
her
favourites
sauciness
and
after
all
said
rupert
as
he
bestowed
his
venerable
relative
on
her
chair
with
an
ineffable
air
of
politeness
contradicted
though
only
for
an
instant
by
the
look
which
he
shot
at
molly
from
the
light
hazel
eyes
tanty
is
not
so
far
wrongthe
only
difference
between
night
and
day
is
the
difference
between
the
brunette
and
the
blonde

a
little
bow
to
each
of
the
sisters

irish
bull
if
one
comes
to
analyse
it
is
but
the
expression
of
the
too
rapid
working
of
quick
wits
faith
nephew
said
tanty
sitting
down
in
high
good
humour
to
the
innumerable
good
things
in
which
her
epicurean
old
soul
delighted
that
is
about
as
true
a
thing
as
ever
you
said
our
irish
tongues
are
apt
to
get
behind
a
thing
before
it
is
there
and
they
call
that
making
a
bull
ruperts
sense
of
humour
was
as
keen
as
most
of
his
other
faculties
and
at
the
unconscious
humour
of
this
sally
his
laugh
rang
out
frankly
while
molly
and
madeleine
giggled
in
their
plates
and
miss
odonoghue
chuckled
quietly
to
herself
in
the
intervals
of
eating
and
drinking
content
to
have
been
witty
without
troubling
to
discover
how
sophia
alone
remained
unmoved
by
mirth
indeed
as
she
raised
her
drooping
head
amazed
at
the
clamour
an
unwary
tear
trickled
down
her
long
nose
into
her
tea
she
was
given
to
revelling
in
anniversaries
of
dead
and
gone
joys
or
sorrows
the
one
as
melancholy
to
her
to
look
back
upon
as
the
other
and
upon
this
november
day
now
very
many
years
ago
had
the
ardent
consumptive
rector
first
hinted
at
his
love
and
now
said
miss
odonoghue
who
having
disposed
of
the
most
serious
part
of
the
breakfast
pushed
away
her
plate
with
one
hand
while
she
stirred
her
second
cup
of
wellcreamed
tea
lazily
with
the
other
now
rupert
will
you
tell
me
the
arrangements
you
propose
to
make
to
enable
me
to
see
your
good
brother
rupert
had
anticipated
being
attacked
upon
this
subject
and
had
fully
prepared
himself
to
defend
the
peculiar
position
it
was
his
interest
to
maintain
to
encourage
a
meeting
between
his
brother
and
the
old
lady
to
whom
the
present
position
of
affairs
was
a
grievous
offence
did
not
certainly
enter
into
his
plan
of
action
but
tanty
had
put
the
question
in
an
unexpected
and
slightly
awkward
shape
and
for
a
second
or
two
he
hesitated
before
replying
i
fear
said
he
then
gliding
into
the
subject
with
his
usual
easy
fluency
that
you
will
be
disappointed
if
you
have
been
reckoning
upon
an
interview
with
adrian
my
dear
aunt
the
hermit
will
not
be
drawn
from
his
shell
on
any
pretext
what
cried
tanty
while
her
withered
cheek
flushed
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
my
nephew
sir
adrian
landale
will
decline
to
come
a
few

his

repeated
the
irate
old
lady
rattling
the
spoon
with
much
emphasis
against
her
cup
if
you
mean
this
rupert
it
is
an
insult
to
me
which
i
shall
never
forgetnever
she
rose
from
her
seat
as
she
concluded
shaking
with
the
tremulous
anger
of
age
for
gods
sake

rupert
throwing
into
his
voice

the
generous
warmth
he
was
capable
of
simulating

not
hold
me
responsible
for

in
this
matter
his
strange
vagaries
are

said
miss
odonoghue
loftily
if
you
will
kindly
send
the
letter
i
am
about
to
write
to
your
brother
by
a
safe
messenger
immediately
i
shall
believe
that
it
is
your
wish
to
treat
me
with
proper
respect
whatever
may
be
adrians
subsequent
behaviour
mr
landales
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
very
genuine
distress
this
was
just
the
one
proof
of
dutiful
attachment
that
he
was
loth
to
bestow
upon
his
cherished
aunt
i
see
how
it
is
he
exclaimed
earnestly
coming
up
to
the
old
lady
and
laying
his
hand
gently
upon
her
arm
you
entirely
misunderstand
the
situation
i
am
not
a
free
agent
in
this
matter
i
cannot
do
what
you
ask
i
am
bound
by
pledge
adrian
is
undoubtedly
more
thanpeculiar
on
certain
points
and
really
i
dare
not
if
i
would
thwart
him
oh
cried
tanty
shooting
off
the
ejaculation
as
from
a
popgun
then
shaking
herself
free
of
ruperts
touch
she
sat
down
abruptly
in
her
chair
again
and
began
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
not
even
in
her
interchange
of
amenities
with
mrs
hambledon
had
molly
seen
her
display
so
much
indignation
you
want
me
to
believe
he
is
mad
i
suppose
she
snapped
at
last
dear
me
no
no
no
responded
the
other
in
his
airy
way
i
did
not
mean
to
go
so
far
as
that
butwell
there
are
very
painful
matters
and
hitherto
i
have
avoided
all
discussion
upon
them
even
with
sophia
my
affection
for
adrian
fiddlesticks
interrupted
tanty
you
meant
something
i
suppose
either
the
mans
mad
or
he
is
not
and
i
for
one
dont
believe
a
word
of
it
the
worst
sign
about
him
that
i
can
see
is
the
blind
confidence
the
poor
fellow
seems
to
put
in
you
here
molly
who
had
been
listening
to
the
discussion
with
all
her
earsanything
connected
with
the
mysterious
personality
of
the
absent
head
of
the
house
was
beginning
to
have
a
special
fascination
for
hergave
an
irrepressible
little
note
of
laughter
rupert
looked
up
at
her
quickly
and
their
eyes
met
hold
your
tongue
miss
cried
miss
odonoghue
sharply
aware
that
she
had
gone
too
far
in
her
last
remark
and
glad
to
relieve
her
oppression
in
another
direction
how
dare
you
laugh
sophia
this
is
a
terrible
thing
your
brother
wants
me
to
believemay
i
ask
what
your
opinion
is
though
ill
not
deny
i
dont
think
that
will
be
worth
much
sophia
glanced
helplessly
at
rupert
but
he
was
far
too
carefully
possessed
of
himself
to
affect
to
perceive
her
embarrassment
come
come
cried
miss
odonoghue
whose
eyes
nothing
escaped
you
need
not
look
at
rupert
you
can
answer
for
yourself
i
supposeyou
are
not
absolutely
a
drivelling
idiotall
the
landales
are
not
ripening
for
lunatic
asylumscollect
your
wits
sophia
i
know
you
have
not
got
any
but
you
have
enough
to
be
able
to
give
a
plain
answer
to
a
plain
question
i
suppose
do
you
think
your
brother
mad
child
god
forbid
murmured
sophia
at
the
very
extremity
of
those
wits
of
which
miss
odonoghue
had
so
poor
an
opinion
oh
no
dear
aunt
not
mad
of
course
not
in
the
least
mad
then
gathering
from
a
restless
movement
of
ruperts
that
she
was
not
upon
the
right
tack
she
faltered
floundered
wildly
and
finally
drew
forth
the
inevitable
pockethandkerchief
to
add
feelingly
if
irrelevantly
from
its
folds
and
indeed
if
i
thought
such
a
calamity
had
really
fallen
upon
usand
of
course
there
are
symptoms
no
doubt
there
are
symptoms
what
are
his
symptomshas
he
tried
to
murder
any
of
you
hey
oh
my
dear
aunt
no
indeed
dear
adrian
is
gentleness
itself
does
he
bite
does
he
gibber
oh
away
with
you
sophia
i
am
sure
i
cannot
wonder
at
the
poor
fellow
wanting
to
live
on
a
rock
between
you
and
rupert
i
am
sure
the
periwinkles
and
the
gulls
must
be
pleasant
company
compared
to
you
that
alone
would
show
i
should
think
that
he
knows
right
well
what
he
is
about
mad
indeed
there
never
was
any
madness
among
the
odonoghues
except
your
poor
uncle
michael
who
got
a
box
on
the
ear
from
a
windmilland
he
wasnt
an
odonoghue
at
all
you
will
be
kind
enough
nephew
to
have
delivered
to
sir
adrian
no
later
than
today
the
letter
which
i
shall
this
moment
indite
to
him
perhaps
said
rupert
if
you
will
only
favour
me
with
your
attention
for
a
few
minutes
first
aunt
and
allow
me
to
narrate
to
you
the
circumstances
of
my
brothers
return
here
and
of
his
subsequent
selfexile
you
will
see
fit
to
change
your
opinion
both
as
regards
him
and
myself
a
selfcontrolled
nature
will
in
the
long
run
rightly
or
wrongly
always
assume
the
ascendency
over
an
excitable
one
the
moderateness
of
ruperts
words
the
coolness
of
his
manner
here
brought
tanty
rapidly
down
from
her
pinnacle
of
passion
certainly
she
said
she
was
not
only
ready
but
anxious
to
hear
all
that
rupert
could
have
to
say
for
himself
and
smoothing
down
her
black
satin
apron
with
a
shaking
hand
the
old
lady
prepared
to
listen
with
as
much
judicial
dignity
as
her
flustered
state
allowed
her
to
assume
rupert
drew
his
chair
opposite
to
hers
and
leant
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
fixed
his
bright
hard
eyes
upon
her
you
remember
of
course
he
began
after
a
moments
pause
how
at
the
time
of
my
poor
fathers
death
adrian
was
reported
to
have
lost
his
life
in
the
vende
warthough
without
authoritative
confirmationat
the
same
time
as
the
fair
and
unhappy
countesse
de
savenaye
to
whose
fortune
he
had
so
chivalrously
devoted
himself
tanty
bowed
her
head
in
solemn
assent
but
molly
watching
with
the
most
acute
attention
felt
her
face
blaze
at
the
indefinable
shade
of
mockery
she
thought
to
catch
upon
the
speakers
curling
lip
it
was
continued
he
the
constant
strain
the
long
months
of
watching
in
vain
for
tidings
that
told
upon
my
father
rather
than
the
actual
grief
of
loss
when
he
died
the
responsibilities
of
the
headship
of
the
house
devolved
naturally
upon
me
the
only
male
representative
left
seemingly
to
undertake
them
the
months
went
by
to
the
most
sanguine
the
belief
in
adrians
death
became
inevitable
our
hopes
died
slowly
but
they
died
at
last
we
mourned
for
him
here
rupert
cast
down
his
eyes
till
the
thick
black
lashes
which
were
one
of
his
beauties
swept
his
cheek
his
tone
was
perfect
in
its
simple
gravity
at
length
urged
thereto
by
all
the
family
if
i
remember
rightly
by
yourself
as
well
dear
aunt
i
assumed
the
title
as
well
as
the
position
which
seemed
mine
by
right
i
was
very
young
at
the
time
but
i
do
not
think
that
either
then
or
during
the
ten
years
that
followed
i
unworthily
filled
my
brothers
place
there
was
a
proud
ring
of
sincerity
in
the
last
words
and
the
old
lady
knew
that
they
were
true
that
during
the
years
of
his
absolute
power
as
well
as
of
his
present
more
restricted
mastership
ruperts
management
of
the
estate
was
unimpeachable
certainly
not
my
dear
rupert
she
said
in
softer
tones
than
she
had
hitherto
used
to
him
no
one
would
dream
of
suggesting
such
a
thingpray
go
on
and
so
pursued
the
nephew
with
a
short
laugh
relapsing
into
that
light
tone
of
banter
which
was
his
most
natural
mode
of
expression
when
one
fine
day
a
hired
coach
clattered
up
sir
rupert
landales
avenue
and
deposited
upon
his
porch
a
tattered
mariner
who
announced
himself
in
melancholy
tones
that
would
have
befitted
the
ghost
no
doubt
many
took
him
for
as
the
rightful
sir
adrian
erroneously
supposed
defunct
i
confess
that
it
required
a
little
persuasion
to
make
me
recognise
my
longlost
brotherand
yet
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
the
missing
heir
had
come
to
his
own
again
the
dead
had
come
back
to
life
well
we
killed
the
fatted
calf
and
all
the
rest
of
itbut
i
need
not
inflict
upon
you
the
narrative
of
our
rejoicing
faith
no
said
tanty
drily
i
can
see
it
with
half
an
eye
you
know
too
i
believe
the
series
of
extraordinary
adventures
or
misadventures
which
had
kept
him
roaming
on
the
high
seas
while
we
at
home
set
up
tablets
to
his
memory
and
wore
our
blacks
as
people
here
call
it
and
cultivated
a
chastened
resignation
there
was
a
good
deal
of
correspondence
going
on
at
the
time
between
pulwick
and
bunratty
if
i
remember
aright
and
you
heard
all
about
adrians
divers
attempts
to
land
in
england
about
his
fight
with
the
kings
men
his
crack
on
the
head
and
final
impressment
at
least
you
heard
as
much
as
we
could
gather
ourselves
adrian
is
not
what
one
would
call
a
garrulous
person
at
the
best
of
times
it
was
really
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
we
managed
to
extract
enough
out
of
him
to
piece
together
a
coherent
tale
well
well
quoth
tanty
with
impatience
you
are
glib
enough
for
two
anyhow
my
dear
all
this
does
not
tell
me
how
adrian
came
to
live
on
a
lighthouse
and
why
you
put
him
down
as
a
lunatic
not
as
a
lunatic
corrected
rupert
gently
merely
as
slightly
eccentric
on
certain
points
though
indeed
if
you
had
seen
him
during
those
first
months
after
his
return
i
think
even
you
with
your
optimistic
spirit
would
have
feared
as
we
did
that
he
was
falling
into
melancholia
thank
heaven
he
is
better
now
but
dear
me
what
we
went
through
i
declare
i
expected
every
morning
to
be
informed
that
sir
adrians
corpse
had
been
found
hanging
from
his
bedpost
or
discovered
in
a
jelly
at
the
bottom
of
the
bluffs
and
indeed
when
at
length
he
disappeared
for
three
days
after
he
had
been
last
observed
mooning
along
the
coast
there
was
a
terrible
panic
lest
he
should
have
sought
a
congenial
and
soothing
end
in
the
embraces
of
the
quicksands
it
turned
out
however
that
he
had
merely
strolled
over
to
scartheywhere
as
you
know
my
father
established
a
beacon
and
installed
a
keeper
to
warn
boats
off
our
shoalsand
finding
the
place
to
his
liking
had
remained
there
regardless
of
our
feelings
tut
tut
said
tanty
but
whether
in
reproof
of
ruperts
flippant
language
or
of
her
elder
nephews
erratic
behaviour
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
determine
of
course
went
on
rupert
smoothly
i
had
resolved
after
a
decent
period
to
remove
my
lares
and
penates
from
a
house
where
i
was
no
longer
master
and
to
establish
myself
with
my
small
patrimony
i
believe
i
ought
to
call
it
matrimony
as
we
younger
children
benefit
by
our
odonoghue
mother
in
an
independent
establishment
but
when
i
first
broached
the
subject
adrian
was
so
vastly
distressed
expressed
himself
so
well
satisfied
with
my
management
of
the
estate
and
begged
me
so
earnestly
to
consider
pulwick
as
my
home
vowing
that
he
himself
would
never
marry
and
that
all
he
looked
forward
to
in
life
was
to
see
me
wedded
and
with
future
heirs
to
the
name
springing
around
me
that
it
would
have
been
actual
unkindness
to
resist
moreover
as
you
can
imagine
adrian
is
not
exactly
a
man
of
business
and
his
spasmodic
interferences
in
the
control
of
the
property
being
already
then
of
a
very
injudicious
nature
i
confess
that
having
nursed
it
myself
for
eleven
years
with
some
success
i
dreaded
to
think
what
it
would
become
under
his
auspices
and
so
i
agreed
to
remain
but
the
position
increased
in
difficulty
adrians
moroseness
seemed
to
grow
upon
him
he
showed
an
exaggerated
horror
of
company
either
flying
from
visitors
as
from
the
pest
and
shutting
himself
up
in
his
own
apartments
or
on
the
few
disastrous
occasions
when
my
persuasions
induced
him
to
show
himself
to
some
old
family
friends
entertaining
them
with
such
unusual
sentiments
concerning
social
laws
the
magistracy
the
government
his
majesty
the
king
himself
that
the
most
extraordinary
reports
about
him
soon
spread
over
the
whole
county
this
was
about
the
timeas
you
may
rememberof
my
own
marriage
here
an
alteration
crept
into
mr
landales
voice
and
molly
looked
at
him
curiously
while
miss
sophia
gave
vent
to
an
audible
sniff
to
be
sure
said
tanty
hastily
comfortably
egotistic
old
ladies
have
an
instinctive
dislike
to
painful
topics
and
that
ruperts
sorrow
for
his
young
wife
had
been
if
selfcentred
and
reserved
of
an
intense
and
prolonged
nature
was
known
to
all
the
family
the
widower
himself
had
no
intention
of
dilating
upon
it
his
wifes
name
he
never
mentioned
and
no
one
could
guess
heavily
as
the
blow
was
known
to
have
fallen
upon
him
the
seething
bitterness
that
her
loss
had
left
in
his
soul
nor
imagine
how
different
a
man
he
might
have
been
if
that
one
strong
affection
of
his
life
had
been
spared
to
soften
it
adrian
fled
from
the
wedding
festivities
as
you
may
remember
for
you
were
our
honoured
guest
at
the
time
and
greatly
displeased
at
his
absence
he
resumed
after
a
few
seconds
of
darkling
reflection
none
of
us
knew
where
he
had
flown
to
for
he
did
not
evidently
consider
his
owls
nest
sufficiently
remote
but
we
had
his
fraternal
blessing
to
sustain
us
and
after
that
he
continued
to
make
periodical
disappearances
to
his
retreat
stopping
away
each
time
longer
and
longer
one
fine
day
he
sent
workmen
to
the
island
with
directions
to
repair
certain
rooms
in
the
keep
and
he
began
to
transfer
thereto
furniture
his
books
and
his
organ
a
dilapidated
little
french
prisoner
next
appeared
on
the
scene
whom
my
brother
had
extracted
from
the
tower
of
liverpool
which
was
then
crammed
with
such
gentry
and
finally
we
were
informed
that
with
this
worthy
companion
sir
adrian
landale
was
determined
to
take
up
his
abode
altogether
at
scarthey
undertaking
the
duties
of
the
recently
defunct
lightkeeper
so
off
he
went
and
there
he
is
still
he
has
extracted
from
us
a
solemn
promise
that
his
privacy
is
to
be
absolutely
respected
and
that
no
communications
or
above
all
visits
are
to
be
made
to
him
occasionally
when
we
least
expect
it
he
descends
upon
us
from
his
tower
upsets
all
my
accounts
makes
the
most
absurd
concessions
to
the
tenants
rides
round
the
estate
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
disappears
again
et
voil
my
dear
aunt
how
we
stand
well
nephew
said
miss
odonoghue
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
am
sure
for
putting
me
au
courant
of
the
family
affairs
it
is
all
very
sadvery
sad
and
very
deplorable
but
but
mr
landale
was
quite
aware
that
tanty
was
not
yet
convinced
to
the
desired
extent
he
therefore
here
interrupted
her
to
play
his
last
cardthat
ace
he
had
up
his
sleeve
in
careful
preparation
for
this
trial
of
skill
with
his
keenwitted
relative
and
to
the
suitable
production
of
which
he
had
been
all
along
leading
rising
from
his
chair
with
slow
deliberate
movement
he
proceeded
as
if
following
his
own
train
of
thought
without
noticing
that
miss
odonoghue
was
intent
on
speech
herself
you
have
not
seen
him
i
believe
since
he
was
quite
a
lad
you
would
have
some
difficulty
in
recognising
him
though
he
bears
like
the
rest
of
us
what
you
call
the
unmistakable
landale
stamp
his
portrait
is
here
by
the
wayduly
installed
in
its
correct
position
that
with
a
laugh
was
one
of
his
freaks
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
up
the
family
traditions
he
saidand
there
you
will
approve
of
him
no
doubt
but
hardly
perhaps
of
the
manner
in
which
he
has
had
that
laudable
intention
carried
out
my
own
portrait
was
of
course
deposed
like
the
original
added
mr
landale
with
something
of
a
sneer
and
now
hangs
meekly
in
some
bedroom
or
otherin
that
if
i
mistake
not
at
present
hallowed
by
my
fair
cousins
presence
well
it
is
good
for
the
soul
of
man
to
be
humbled
as
we
are
taught
to
believe
from
our
earliest
years
tanty
was
fumbling
for
her
eyeglasses
she
was
glad
to
hear
that
adrian
had
remembered
some
of
his
obligations
she
observed
sententiously
as
she
hauled
herself
stiffly
out
of
her
chair
to
approach
the
chimneypiece
it
was
certainly
a
sign
that
he
was
more
mindful
of
his
duties
as
head
of
the
house
than
one
would
expect
from
a
person
hardly
responsible
such
as
rupert
had
represented
him
to
be
and

here
the
glasses
being
adjusted
and
focussed
upon
the
portrait
miss
odonoghue
halted
abruptly
with
a
dropping
jaw
there
is
a
curious
inscription
underneath
the
escutcheon
said
mr
landale
composedly
which
latter
by
the
way
you
may
notice
is
the
only
one
in
the
line
which
has
no
room
for
an
impaled
coat
adrians
way
of
indicating
not
only
that
he
is
single
but
means
to
remain
such
adrian
composed
it
himself
and
indeed
attached
a
marked
importance
to
it
let
me
read
it
for
you
dear
tanty
the
picture
hangs
a
little
high
and
those
curveting
letters
are
hard
to
decipher
it
runs
thus
sir
adrian
william
hugh
landale
lord
of
pulwick
and
scarthey
in
the
county
palatine
of
lancaster
eighth
baronet
born
march
12th
1775
succeeded
to
the
title
and
estate
on
the
10th
february
1799
whilst
abroad
iniquitously
pressed
into
the
kings
service
on
the
day
of
his
return
home
january
2nd
1801
twice
flogged
for
alleged
insubordination
and
only
released
at
last
by
the
help
of
a
friend
after
five
years
of
slavery
died
here
a
space
for
the
date
it
is
a
record
with
a
vengeance
is
it
not
notice
my
brothers
determination
to
die
unmarried
and
to
retire
once
for
all
from
all
or
any
of
the
possible
honours
connected
with
his
position
they
had
all
clustered
in
front
of
the
picture

madeleine
roused
from
her
sweet
daydreams
to
some
show
of
curiosity
miss
landales
bosom
heaving
with
such
sighs
as
to
make
the
tombstone
rise
and
fall
like
a
ship
upon
a
stormy
sea
molly
with
an
eagerness
she
did
not
attempt
to
hide
and
miss
odonoghue
still
speechless
with
horror
and
indignation
mr
landale
had
gauged
his
aunts
temperament
correctly
enough
to
one
whose
ruling
passion
was
pride
of
family
this
mockery
of
a
consecrated
family
custom
this
heirloom
destined
to
carry
down
a
record
of
degradation
into
future
generations
was
an
insult
to
the
name
only
to
be
explained
to
her
first
indignation
by
deliberate
maliceor
insanity
and
from
the
breezy
background
of
blue
sky
and
sea
contrasting
as
strangely
with
the
dark
solemnity
of
the
other
portraits
as
did
the
figure
itself
in
its
incongruous
sailor
dress
the
face
of
the
eighth
baronet
looked
down
in
melancholy
gravity
upon
the
group
gathered
in
judgment
upon
him
disgraceful
positively
disgraceful
at
length
cried
the
last
representative
of
the
odonoghues
of
bunratty
in
scandalised
tones
my
dear
rupert
you
should
have
a
curtain
put
up
that
this
exhibition
of
follyof
madness
i
hardly
know
what
to
call
itbe
not
exposed
to
every
casual
visitor
dear
me
dear
me
that
i
should
live
to
see
any
of
my
kin
deliberately
throw
discredit
on
his
family
if
indeed
the
poor
fellow
is
responsible
rupert
my
good
soul
can
you
ascribe
any
reason
for
this
terrible
state
of
affairs

that
blow
on
the
head
in
part
perhaps
said
mr
landale
and
yet
there
have
been
other
causes
at
work
if
i
could
have
a
private
word
in
your
ear
glancing
meaningly
over
his
shoulder
at
the
two
young
girls
who
were
both
listening
though
with
very
different
expressions
of
interest
and
favour
i
could
give
you
my
opinion
more
fully
go
away
now
my
dear
creatures
hereupon
said
miss
odonoghue
promptly
addressing
her
nieces
it
is
a
fine
morning
and
you
will
lose
your
roses
if
you
dont
get
the
air
i
dont
care
if
it
has
begun
to
rain
miss
go
and
have
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
then
young
people
must
have
exercise
well
my
dear
rupert
wellwhen
molly
with
a
pettish
battledore
and
shuttlecock
indeed
had
taken
her
sister
by
the
arm
and
left
the
room
well
my
dear
aunt
the
fact
is
i
believe
my
unhappy
brother
has
never
recovered
fromfrom
his
passion
for
ccile
de
savenaye
that
early
love
affair
so
suddenly
and
tragically
terminatedwell
it
seems
to
have
turned
his
brain
pooh
pooh
why
that
was
twenty
years
ago
dont
tell
me
it
is
in
a
man
to
be
so
constant
in
no
sane
man
perhaps
but
then
you
know
tanty
that
is
just
the
point
remember
the
circumstances
he
loved
her
madly
he
followed
her
lived
near
her
for
months
and
she
was
drowned
before
his
eyes
i
believe
i
never
heard
of
course
any
details
of
that
strange
period
of
his
life
but
we
can
imagine
this
was
a
difficult
vague
subject
to
deal
with
and
mr
landale
wisely
passed
on
moreover
his
behaviour
when
in
this
house
on
his
return
at
first
has
left
me
no
doubt
i
watched
him
closely
he
was
for
ever
haunting
those
rooms
which
she
had
inhabited
when
he
found
her
miniature
in
the
drawingroom
he
went
first
as
white
as
death
then
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
stood
gazing
at
it
i
am
not
exaggerating
for
a
whole
hour
without
moving
and
finally
he
carried
it
off
and
i
know
he
used
to
talk
to
it
in
his
room
and
now
even
if
i
had
not
given
my
poor
brother
my
word
of
honour
never
to
disturb
his
chosen
solitude
i
should
have
felt
it
a
heavy
responsibility
to
promote
a
meeting
which
would
inevitably
bring
back
past
memories
in
a
troublous
manner
upon
him
in
fact
were
he
to
come
across
the
children
of
his
dead
loveabove
all
molly
who
must
be
startlingly
like
her
motherwhat
might
the
result
be
i
hardly
like
to
contemplate
it
the
human
brain
is
a
very
delicately
balanced
organ
my
dear
aunt
and
once
it
gets
ever
so
slightly
out
of
order
one
cannot
be
too
careful
to
avoid
risk
he
finished
his
say
with
an
expressive
gesture
of
the
hand
miss
odonoghue
remained
for
a
moment
plunged
in
reflection
during
which
the
cloud
upon
her
countenance
gradually
lifted
it
is
a
strange
thing
she
said
at
last
but
constancy
seems
to
run
in
the
family
there
is
no
denying
that
here
is
sophia
a
ridiculous
spectacleand
you
yourself
my
dear
rupert
and
now
poor
adrian
too
and
his
case
of
mere
calflove
as
one
would
have
thought
a
calf
may
grow
into
a
fine
bull
you
know
returned
mr
landale
who
had
winced
at
his
aunts
allusion
to
himself
and
now
spoke
in
the
most
unemotional
tone
he
could
assume
especially
if
it
is
well
fostered
in
its
youth
and
i
suppose
said
miss
odonoghue
with
a
faint
smile
you
think
i
ought
to
know
all
about
bulls
she
again
put
up
her
glasses
to
survey
the
portrait
with
critical
deliberation
after
which
recommending
him
once
more
strenuously
to
have
a
curtain
erected
she
observed
that
it
would
break
her
heart
to
look
at
it
one
moment
longer
and
requested
to
be
conducted
from
the
room
mr
landale
could
not
draw
any
positive
conclusion
from
his
aunts
manner
of
receiving
his
confidence
nor
determine
whether
she
had
altogether
grasped
the
whole
meaning
of
what
he
had
intended
delicately
to
convey
to
her
concerning
his
brothers
past
as
well
as
present
position
but
he
had
said
as
much
as
prudence
counselled
chapter
xiii
the
distant
light
in
spite
of
their
first
petulant
or
dolorous
anticipation
and
of
the
contrast
between
the
even
tenor
of
country
life
and
the
constant
stream
of
amusement
which
young
people
of
fashion
can
find
in
a
place
like
bath
the
two
girls
discovered
that
time
glided
pleasantly
enough
over
them
at
pulwick
instead
of
the
gloomy
northern
stronghold
their
novelfed
imagination
had
pictured
the
more
dismally
as
their
sudden
removal
from
town
gaieties
savoured
distantly
of
punishment
at
the
hand
of
their
irate
aunt
they
found
themselves
delivered
over
into
a
bright
admirablyordered
house
replete
with
things
of
beauty
comfortable
to
the
extremity
of
luxury
and
allowed
in
this
place
of
safety
to
enjoy
almost
unrestricted
liberty
the
latter
privilege
was
especially
precious
as
the
sisters
at
that
time
had
engrossing
thoughts
of
their
own
they
wished
to
pursue
and
found
more
interest
in
solitary
roamings
through
the
wide
estate
than
in
the
company
of
the
hosts
on
the
fifth
day
miss
odonoghue
took
her
departure
her
own
travelling
coach
had
rumbled
down
the
avenue
bearing
her
and
her
woman
away
in
its
polished
yellow
embrace
her
flat
trunk
strapped
behind
and
the
goodnatured
old
face
nodding
out
of
the
window
till
molly
and
madeleine
standing
a
little
disconsolate
upon
the
porch
to
watch
her
departure
could
distinguish
even
the
hooked
nose
no
longer
mr
landale
upon
his
mettled
grey
a
gallant
figure
as
molly
herself
was
forced
to
admit
in
his
boots
and
buckskins
had
cantered
in
the
dust
alongside
intent
upon
escorting
his
aged
relative
to
the
second
stage
of
her
journey
that
night
almost
for
the
first
time
since
their
arrival
there
was
no
company
at
dinner
and
the
young
guests
understood
that
the
household
would
now
fall
back
into
its
ordinary
routine
but
without
the
small
flutter
of
seeing
strangers
or
tantys
lively
conversation
the
social
intercourse
soon
waned
into
exceeding
dulness
and
at
an
early
hour
miss
molly
rose
and
withdrew
to
her
room
pretexting
a
headache
for
which
mr
landale
with
his
usual
high
courtesy
affected
deep
concern
as
she
was
slowly
ascending
the
great
oaken
staircase
she
crossed
moggie
the
gatekeepers
daughter
who
in
her
character
of
fostersister
to
one
of
the
guests
had
been
specially
allotted
to
them
as
attendant
during
the
remainder
of
their
visit
to
pulwick
molly
thought
that
the
girl
eyed
her
hesitatingly
as
if
she
wished
to
speak
well
moggie
she
asked
stopping
on
her
way
oh
please
miss
said
the
buxom
lass
blushing
and
dropping
a
curtsey
renny
potter
please
miss
is
up
at
our
lodge
tonight
he
dont
care
to
come
to
the
ouse
so
much
miss
but
when
he
heard
about
you
miss
you
could
have
knocked
him
down
with
a
feather
he
was
so
surprised
and
that
excited
miss
we
have
never
seen
him
so
and
hes
so
set
on
being
allowed
to
see
ye
both
molly
as
yet
failed
to
connect
any
memories
of
interest
with
the
possessor
of
the
patronymic
mentioned
but
the
next
phrase
mentioned
aroused
her
attention
he
is
sir
adrians
servant
now
miss
and
goes
back
yonder
to
the
island
that
is
where
the
master
lives
tomorrow
morning
but
he
would
be
so
happy
to
see
the
young
ladies
before
he
goes
if
the
liberty
were
forgiven
he
says
he
was
servant
to
the
madam
your
mother
miss
well
moggie
answered
miss
molly
smiling
if
that
is
all
that
is
required
to
make
renny
potter
happy
it
is
very
easily
done
tell
renny
potter
tomorrow
morning
and
she
proceeded
on
her
way
pondering
while
the
successful
emissary
pattered
down
to
the
lodge
in
high
glee
to
gather
her
reward
in
her
sweethearts
company





when
later
on
madeleine
joined
her
sister
she
found
her
standing
by
the
deep
recessed
window
the
curtains
of
which
were
drawn
back
resting
her
head
on
her
hand
against
the
wainscot
and
gazing
abroad
into
the
night
she
approached
and
passing
her
hand
round
mollys
waist
looked
out
also
again
at
your
window
it
is
a
beautiful
night
and
the
view
very
lovely
said
molly
and
indeed
the
moon
was
riding
high
in
a
deep
blue
starry
heaven
and
shimmered
on
the
strip
of
distant
sea
visible
from
the
windows
yes
but
yesterday
the
night
was
not
fine
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
blackness
and
it
was
the
same
the
day
before
and
yet
you
stared
out
of
this
window
as
you
have
every
night
since
our
coming
it
is
strange
to
see
you
so
what
is
it
why
dont
you
tell
me
madeleine
said
molly
suddenly
after
a
lengthy
pause
i
am
simply
haunted
by
that
light
over
yonder
the
light
of
scarthey
there
is
a
mystery
about
those
ruins
on
which
i
keep
meditating
all
day
long
i
want
to
know
more
it
draws
me
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
now
to
set
sail
and
land
there
all
unknown
to
any
one
and
see
what
manner
of
life
is
led
where
that
light
is
burning
but
madeleine
merely
gave
a
pout
of
little
interest
what
do
you
think
you
would
find
a
halfwitted
middleaged
man
mooning
among
a
litter
of
books
with
an
old
woman
and
a
little
frenchman
to
look
after
him
why
mr
landale
himself
takes
no
trouble
to
conceal
that
his
poor
brother
is
an
almost
hopeless
lunatic
mr
landale
molly
began
with
much
contempt
but
she
interrupted
herself
and
went
on
simply
mr
landale
is
a
very
fine
gentleman
with
very
superior
manners
he
speaks
like
a
printed
bookbut
for
all
that
i
would
like
to
know
madeleine
laughed
the
demon
of
curiosity
has
a
hold
of
you
molly
remember
the
fable
they
made
us
repeat
de
loin
cest
quelque
chose
et
de
prs
ce
nest
rien
now
you
shall
go
straight
into
your
bed
and
not
take
cold
and
miss
madeleine
after
authoritatively
closing
the
curtains
kissed
her
sister
and
was
about
to
commence
immediate
disrobing
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
shagreencovered
book
lying
open
on
the
table
so
your
headache
was
your
diaryhow
i
should
like
to
have
a
peep
i
daresay
said
molly
sarcastically
and
then
sat
down
and
pen
in
hand
began
to
reread
her
nights
entry
now
and
then
casting
a
tantalising
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
her
sister
the
lines
in
the
flowing
convent
hand
ran
thus
aunt
odonoghue
left
us
this
morning
and
so
here
we
are
planted
in
pulwick
and
she
has
achieved
her
plan
fully
but
what
is
odd
is
that
neither
madeleine
nor
i
seem
to
mind
it
now
what
has
come
over
madeleine
is
her
secret
and
she
keeps
it
close
but
that
i
should
like
being
here
is
strange
indeed
and
yet
every
day
something
happens
to
make
me
feel
connected
with
pulwicksomething
more
i
mean
than
the
mere
fact
that
we
were
born
here
so
many
of
the
older
people
greet
me
at
first
as
if
they
knew
methey
all
say
i
am
so
like
the
madam
they
dont
see
the
same
likeness
in
madeleine
for
all
her
grand
air
there
was
mrs
mearson
the
gatekeeper
was
struck
in
amazement
and
the
old
housekeeper
whenever
she
has
an
opportunity
tries
to
entertain
me
about
the
beautiful
foreign
lady
and
the
grand
times
they
had
at
pulwick
when
she
was
here
and
sir
tummas
was
still
alive
but
though
we
are
made
to
feel
that
we
are
more
than
ordinary
guests
it
is
not
on
account
of
mr
landale
but
on
account
of
sir
adrianthe
master
as
they
call
him
whom
we
never
see
and
whom
his
brother
would
make
out
to
be
mad
why
is
he
so
anxious
that
sir
adrian
should
not
know
that
aunt
rose
has
brought
us
here
he
seemed
willing
enough
to
please
her
and
yet
nothing
that
she
could
say
of
her
wish
could
induce
him
even
to
send
a
messenger
over
to
the
rock
and
now
we
may
be
here
all
these
two
months
and
never
even
have
caught
a
sight
of
the
master
i
wonder
if
he
is
still
like
that
portraitwhether
he
bears
that
face
still
as
he
now
sits
all
alone
brooding
as
his
brother
says
up
in
those
ruined
chambers
while
the
light
burns
calm
and
bright
in
the
tower
what
can
this
man
of
his
have
to
say
to
me
molly
dotted
her
last
forgotten
i
blotted
it
closed
and
carefully
locked
the
book
then
rising
she
danced
over
to
her
sister
and
forced
her
into
a
pirouette
and
now
she
cried
gaily
our
dear
old
tanty
is
pulling
on
her
nightcap
and
weeping
over
her
posset
in
the
stuffy
room
at
lancaster
regretting
me
and
i
should
be
detesting
her
with
all
my
energies
for
leaving
me
behind
her
were
it
not
that
just
at
present
i
actually
find
pulwick
more
interesting
than
bath
madeleine
lifted
her
heavylidded
eyes
a
little
wonderingly
to
her
sisters
face
as
she
paused
in
her
gyration
what
fly
stings
thee
now
she
inquired
in
french
you
do
not
tell
me
about
your
wounds
my
dear
those
wounds
which
little
dan
cupid
has
made
upon
your
tender
heart
with
his
naughty
little
arrow
and
which
give
you
such
sweet
pain
apparently
that
you
revel
in
the
throes
all
day
long
and
yet
i
am
a
good
child
you
shall
guess
if
you
guess
aright
i
shall
tell
you
so
now
begin
they
stood
before
the
fire
and
the
leaping
tongues
of
light
played
upon
their
white
garments
madeleines
nightgear
scarcely
more
treacherously
telltale
of
her
slender
womans
loveliness
than
the
evening
robe
that
clung
so
closely
to
the
vigorous
grace
of
mollys
lithe
young
figure
the
elder
whose
face
bore
a
blush
distinct
from
the
reflected
glow
of
the
embers
fell
to
guessing
as
commanded
a
little
wildly
you
begin
to
find
the
beau
cousin
rupert
a
little
more
interesting
than
you
anticipated
bah
cried
molly
with
a
stamp
of
her
sandalled
foot
it
is
not
possible
to
guess
worse
he
is
more
insufferable
to
me
hour
by
hour
i
think
him
kind
and
pleasant
returned
madeleine
simply
ah
because
he
makes
sweet
eyes
at
you
i
supposeyet
noi
express
myself
badlyhe
could
not
make
anything
sweet
out
of
those
hard
hard
eyes
of
his
but
he
is
verywhat
they
call
here
in
englandattentive
to
you
and
he
looks
at
you
and
ponders
you
over
when
you
little
think
ityou
poor
innocentlost
in
your
dream
of

smith
there
i
will
not
tease
you
guess
again
you
are
pleased
to
remain
here
because
you
are
a
true
weathercockbecause
you
like
one
thing
one
day
another
the
nextbecause
the
country
peace
and
quiet
is
soothing
to
you
after
the
folly
and
noise
of
the
great
world
of
bath
and
dublin
and
reminds
you
refreshingly
as
it
does
me
of
our
happy
convent
days
the
glimmer
of
a
dainty
malice
lurked
in
the
apparent
candour
of
madeleines
grave
blue
eyes
and
from
thence
spread
into
her
pretty
smile
at
the
sight
of
mollys
disdainful
lip
well
then
i
give
it
up
you
have
some
mischief
on
foot
of
that
at
least
i
am
sure
no
mischiefa
work
of
righteousness
rather
sister
madeleine
you
heard
all
that
that
gallant
gentleman
you
think
so
highly
ofyour
cousin
rupert
my
dear
it
was
a
little
way
of
mollys
to
throw
the
responsibility
of
anything
she
did
not
like
even
to
an
obnoxious
relationship
upon
another
persons
shoulders
narrated
of
his
brother
sir
adrian
and
how
he
persuaded
tanty
that
he
was
as
you
said
just
now
a
hopeless
madman
but
yeshe
does
mad
things
said
the
elder
twin
a
little
wonderingly
well
madeleine
it
is
a
vile
lie
i
am
convinced
of
it
but
my
darling
look
here
madeleine
there
is
something
behind
it
all
i
attacked
that
creature
that
rag
you
cannot
call
her
a
woman
that
female
cousin
of
yours
sophia
and
i
pressed
her
hard
too
but
she
could
not
give
me
a
single
instance
about
sir
adrian
that
is
really
the
least
like
insanity
and
last
night
when
the
young
fool
who
escorted
me
to
dinner
coventry
his
name
was
told
me
that
every
one
says
sir
adrian
is
shut
up
on
the
island
and
that
his
french
servant
is
really
his
keeper
and
that
it
was
a
shame
rupert
was
not
the
eldest
brother
i
quite
saw
the
sort
of
story
master
rupert
likes
to
spreaddont
interrupt
please
when
you
were
woolgathering
over
the
fire
last
night
in
the
lively
and
companionable
way
permit
me
to
remark
in
parenthesis
that
you
have
adopted
of
late
and
you
thought
i
was
with
tanty
i
had
marched
off
with
my
flat
candlestick
to
the
picture
gallery
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
socalled
lunatic
i
dragged
over
a
chair
and
lit
the
candles
in
the
candelabra
each
side
of
the
chimneypiece
and
then
standing
on
my
perch
still
i
held
up
my
own
torch
and
i
saw
the
sailor
really
well
i
think
he
has
a
beautiful
face
and
that
he
is
no
more
mad
than
i
am
but
he
looks
so
sad
so
sad
i
longed
to
make
those
closed
lips
part
and
tell
me
their
secret
and
as
i
was
looking
and
dreaming
my
dear
just
as
you
might
i
heard
a
little
noise
and
there
was
rupert
only
a
few
yards
off
surveying
me
with
such
an
angry
gazeugh
with
a
shiver
i
hate
such
ways
he
came
in
upon
me
with
soft
steps
like
some
animal
look
at
his
portrait
there
madeleinestay
i
shall
hold
up
the
light
as
i
did
last
night
to
sir
adriansee
it
flickers
and
glimmers
and
makes
him
seem
as
if
he
were
aliveoh
i
wish
he
were
not
hanging
in
front
of
our
beds
staring
out
at
us
with
those
eyes
you
think
them
very
fine
i
daresay
that
is
because
his
lashes
are
as
thick
and
dark
as
a
womansbut
the
look
in
them
my
deardo
you
know
what
it
reminds
me
of
of
the
beautiful
cruel
greyhound
we
saw
at
the
coursing
at
that
place
near
bunratty
you
remember
just
before
they
started
the
hare
when
he
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
looking
out
across
the
plain
i
can
never
forget
the
expression
of
those
yellowcircled
eyes
and
when
i
see
rupert
look
at
you
as
if
he
were
fixing
something
in
the
far
distance
it
gives
me
just
the
feeling
of
horror
and
sickness
i
had
then
you
remember
how
dreadful
it
was
rupert
makes
me
think
of
a
greyhound
altogether
he
is
so
lithe
and
so
cleancut
and
so
full
of
eagerness
a
sort
of
trembling
eagerness
underneath
his
seeming
quiet
and
i
think
he
could
be
cruel
molly
paused
with
an
unusually
grave
and
reflective
look
madeleine
yawned
a
little
not
at
all
impressed
how
you
exaggerate
she
said
well
what
happened
when
he
came
in
and
caught
you
the
poor
man
i
suppose
he
thought
you
were
setting
the
house
on
fire
my
dear
i
turned
as
red
as
a
poppy
and
began
blowing
out
all
my
illumination
feeling
dreadfully
guilty
and
then
he
helped
me
off
my
chair
with
such
an
air
of
politeness
that
i
could
have
struck
him
with
pleasure
but
i
soon
gathered
my
wits
again
and
vexed
with
myself
for
being
a
ninny
i
just
dropped
him
a
little
curtsey
and
said
ive
been
examining
my
mad
cousin
well
and
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
asked
me
smiling
his
abominable
smile
but
i
can
keep
my
thoughts
to
myself
as
well
as
other
people
i
think
he
is
very
handsome
i
answered
and
then
i
wagged
my
head
and
added
poor
fellow
just
as
if
i
thought
he
was
really
mad
poor
fellow
said
cousin
rupert
still
with
his
smile
whereupon
we
interchanged
goodnights
and
he
ceremoniously
reconducted
me
to
my
door
what
was
he
spying
after
me
for
like
that
my
dear
your
cousin
has
a
bad
consciencebut
i
can
spy
tooi
have
been
questioning
the
servants
today
and
some
of
the
people
on
the
estate
oh
molly
come
dont
be
so
shocked
it
was
diplomatically
of
course
but
i
am
determined
to
find
out
the
truth
well
so
far
from
looking
upon
sir
adrian
as
a
lunatic
they
all
adore
him
it
seems
to
me
he
comes
here
periodicallyonce
every
three
months
or
soand
it
is
like
the
kings
justices
you
knowst
louis
of
francehe
redresses
all
wrongs
and
listens
to
grievances
and
gives
alms
and
counsel
and
every
one
can
come
with
his
story
down
to
the
poorest
wretch
on
the
estate
and
they
certainly
gave
me
to
understand
that
they
would
fare
pretty
hardly
under
mr
landale
if
it
were
not
for
that
mild
beneficent
restraining
influence
in
his
tower
yonder
it
is
very
romantic
do
you
know
you
like
romance
madeleine
i
wonder
if
sir
adrian
will
come
over
while
we
are
here
oh
i
hope
i
hope
he
will
i
shall
never
rest
till
i
have
seen
him
silly
child
said
madeleine
and
so
that
is
the
reason
you
are
glad
to
remain
here
even
so
my
dear
answered
the
other
skipped
into
the
big
fourpost
bed
carefully
ascertained
and
selected
the
softest
pillow
and
then
smiling
sweetly
at
her
sister
from
under
a
frame
of
dark
curls
let
her
white
lids
drop
over
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
and
so
intimated
she
desired
to
sleep

was
soon
after
sunriseat
that
time
of
year
an
hour
not
exorbitantly
earlywhen
molly
awoke
from
a
tangle
of
fantastic
dreams
in
which
the
haunting
figure
of
her
waking
thoughts
the
hermit
of
scarthey
appeared
to
her
in
varied
shapes
as
an
aweinspiring
saintly
ascetic
with
long
white
hair
as
a
young
beautiful
imprisoned
prince
even
as
a
ragged
imbecile
staring
vacantly
at
a
lantern
somewhere
in
a
dismal
seacave
the
last
vision
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
the
girl
under
the
impression
of
so
disgusting
a
disillusion
remained
for
a
while
pondering
and
yawning
before
making
up
her
mind
to
exchange
warmth
and
featherbed
for
her
appointment
without
but
the
shafts
of
light
growing
through
the
chinks
in
the
shutters
ever
brighter
and
more
full
of
dancing
motes
decided
her
a
beautiful
morning

she
said
leaning
over
and
pulling
one
of
the
long
fair
strands
upon
her
neighbours
pillow
with
sisterly
authority
get
up
lazybones
and
come
and
have
a
walk
with
me
before
breakfast
the
sleeping
sister
awoke
smiled
with
her
usual
exquisite
serenity
of
temper
and
politely
refused
molly
insisted
threatened
coaxed
but
to
no
avail
madeleine
was
luxuriously
comfortable
and
was
not
to
be
disturbed
either
mentally
or
bodily
and
molly
aware
of
the
resisting
power
of
will
hidden
under
that
soft
exterior
at
length
petulantly
desisted
and
wrapped
up
in
furs
with
hands
plunged
deep
into
the
recesses
of
a
gigantic
muff
soon
sallied
forth
herself
alone
into
the
park
halfway
down
the
avenue
she
met
blueeyed
moggie
with
round
face
shining
out
of
the
sharp
exhilarating
atmosphere
like
a
small
sun
the
damsel
was
overcome
with
blushes
and
rapture
at
her
young
mistresss
unexpected
promptitude
in
carrying
out
her
promise
and
ran
back
to
warn
her
sweetheart
of
that
ladys
approach





as
molly
drew
near
the
keepers
lodgea
sort
of
doric
temple
quaintly
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
hedgeenclosed
garden
and
halfburied
under
thicklyclustering
interlacing
creepersfrom
the
side
of
the
enormous
nest
of
evergreen
foliage
there
emerged
in
a
state
of
high
excitement
strenuously
subdued
a
short
squarebuilt
man
none
other
than
ren
laptre
whilst
between
the
boughs
of
the
gardenhedge
peeped
forth
the
bashful
ruddy
face
of
the
lady
of
his
fancy
eager
to
watch
the
interview
ren
ran
forward
then
stopped
a
few
paces
away
hat
in
hand
scraping
and
bowing
in
the
throes
of
an
overwhelming
emotion
that
strove
hard
with
humility
ah
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
he
ejaculated
between
spells
of
amazed
staring
and
seemed
unable
to
bring
forth
another
word
and
so
you
have
known
my
mother
ren
said
miss
molly
in
her
native
tongue
with
a
smile
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
of
the
french
words
rens
face
grew
pale
under
its
bronze
and
the
tears
he
had
so
strongly
combated
glistened
in
his
eyes
if
i
had
not
heard
last
night
he
said
at
length
that
these
ladies
had
come
backit
was
moggie
mearson
who
told
me
who
was
foster
sister
to
you
or
was
it
mademoiselle
your
sister
and
proud
she
is
of
itif
i
had
not
known
that
the
young
ladies
were
here
again
when
i
saw
mademoiselle
i
would
have
thought
that
my
lady
herself
had
returned
to
us
may
the
good
god
have
her
soul
ah
to
think
that
i
should
ever
see
her
again
in
the
light
of
the
sun
he
stopped
suffocated
with
the
sob
that
his
respect
would
not
allow
him
to
utter
but
molly
who
had
had
other
objects
in
view
when
she
rose
from
her
couch
this
cold
windy
morning
than
to
present
an
objective
to
a
servingmans
emotion
now
thought
the
situation
had
lasted
long
enough
for
her
enjoyment
and
determined
to
put
an
end
to
it
eh
bien
ren
she
said
gaily
or
should
i
call
you
monsieur
potter
which
by
the
way
is
a
droll
name
for
a
frenchman
i
am
very
glad
to
see
that
you
are
pleased
to
see
me
if
you
would
care
to
have
some
talk
with
me
you
may
attend
me
if
you
like
but
i
freeze
standing
here
stamping
her
feet
one
after
the
other
on
the
hard
ground
i
must
absolutely
walk
and
you
may
put
on
your
hat
again
please
for
it
is
very
cold
for
you
too
she
added
snuggling
into
her
muff
and
under
her
fur
tippet
the
man
obeyed
after
another
of
his
quaint
salutes
and
as
molly
started
forward
followed
her
respectfully
a
pace
in
rear
i
daresay
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
have
a
little
talk
with
a
compatriot
in
your
own
tongue
all
english
as
you
may
have
grown
said
the
young
lady
presently
and
as
moggie
has
told
me
that
you
were
in
my
mothers
service
there
is
a
whole
volume
of
things
which
i
believe
you
alone
can
relate
to
me
you
shall
tell
me
all
that
one
day
but
what
seems
to
me
the
most
curious
first
of
all
is
your
presence
here
we
ourselves
are
only
at
pulwick
by
chance
mademoiselle
said
ren
in
an
earnest
voice
if
you
knew
the
whole
story
you
would
soon
understand
that
since
it
was
not
to
be
that
i
should
remain
the
humble
servitor
of
monseigneur
le
comte
de
savenaye
mademoiselles
father
or
of
madame
who
followed
him
to
heaven
notwithstanding
all
our
efforts
to
preserve
her
it
is
but
natural
that
i
should
attach
myself
since
he
would
allow
it
to
my
present
master
mr
landale
asked
molly
affecting
ignorance
no
mademoiselle
cried
the
frenchman
hotly
my
master
is
sir
adrian
had
mr
landale
remained
the
lord
of
this
place
i
should
have
been
left
to
die
in
my
prisonor
at
least
have
remained
there
until
this
spring
for
it
seems
there
is
peace
again
and
the
tower
of
liverpool
is
empty
now
voyons

conte
moi
cela
ren
said
molly
turning
her
face
beautifully
glowing
from
the
caress
of
the
keen
air
eagerly
to
her
companion
and
he
nothing
loth
to
let
loose
a
naturally
garrulous
tongue
in
such
company
and
on
such
a
theme
started
off
upon
a
long
story
illustrated
by
rapid
gesticulation
i
will
tell
you
cried
he
and
plunged
into
explanation
with
more
energy
than
coherence
it
was
like
this
i
had
been
already
two
years
in
that
prison
we
were
some
hundreds
of
prisoners
and
it
was
a
cruel
place
a
cruel
place
mademoiselle
almost
as
bad
as
that
where
we
were
shut
up
my
master
and
i
together
years
before
at
la
rochelleand
that
i
will
tell
you
if
you
wish
afterwards
i
had
been
taken
by
the
marine
conscription
when
their
republic
became
the
french
empire
and
a
sailor
i
was
then
just
as
i
heard
later
as
sir
adrian
also
was
at
the
time
but
that
i
did
not
know
you
understand
for
they
took
all
those
that
lived
on
the
coast
now
i
had
only
served
with
the
ship
six
months
when
she
was
taken
by
the
english
and
as
i
say
we
were
sent
to
the
prison
in
liverpool
where
we
found
so
many
others
who
had
been
already
there
for
years
when
i
heard
it
was
liverpool
i
knew
it
was
a
place
near
pulwick
and
i
at
once
thought
of
mr
landale
not
him
of
course
they
now
call
mr
landale
but
him
who
had
followed
my
mistress
madame
your
mother
to
help
to
fight
the
republicans
in
the
old
time
and
i
thought
i
was
saved
i
knew
he
would
get
me
out
if
it
was
possible
to
get
any
one
out
for
you
see
i
thought
his
honour
was
home
again
after
we
had
been
beaten
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
for
my
lady
we
had
contrived
to
find
an
english
ship
to
take
him
home
and
he
had
gone
back
as
i
thought
mademoiselle
well
a
prisoner
becomes
cunning
and
besides
i
had
been
in
prison
before
i
managed
to
make
up
a
letter
and
as
i
knew
already
some
english
i
ended
by
persuading
a
man
to
carry
it
to
pulwick
for
me
it
was
a
long
way
and
i
had
no
money
but
i
made
bold
to
assure
him
that
mr
landaleoh
no
not
this
one
ren
interrupted
himself
again
with
a
gesture
eloquent
of
resentful
scorn
but
my
master
i
assured
the
man
that
he
would
receive
recompence
from
him
you
see
mademoiselle
i
knew
his
heart
was
so
good
that
he
would
not
allow
your
mothers
servant
to
rot
in
the
tower
but
days
afterwards
the
man
came
back
oh
he
was
angry
terribly
angry
with
me
and
said
he
should
pay
me
outand
so
he
did
but
it
is
useless
to
tell
you
how
he
had
been
to
pulwick
he
said
and
had
seen
mr
landale
mr
landale
never
knew
anything
of
any
french
prisoner
and
refused
to
give
any
money
to
the
messenger
ah
mademoiselle
it
was
very
sad
i
had
not
signed
my
letter
for
fear
of
its
getting
into
wrong
hands
but
i
spoke
of
many
things
which
i
knew
he
could
not
have
forgotten
and
now
i
thought
that
he
would
not
trouble
his
mind
about
such
a
wretch
as
rentriple
brute
that
i
was
to
conceive
such
thoughts
i
should
have
deserved
to
remain
there
for
ever
i
did
remain
mademoiselle
more
than
three
years
many
and
many
died
as
for
me
i
am
hard
but
i
thought
i
should
never
never
walk
free
again
nor
would
i
mademoiselle
these
seven
years
but
for
him
he
came
then
said
the
girl
with
sympathetic
enthusiasm
she
was
listening
with
attention
carried
away
by
the
speakers
earnestness
and
knew
instinctively
to
whom
the
him
and
the
he
referred
he
came
said
ren
with
much
emphasis
of
course
he
camethe
moment
he
knew
and
after
a
moment
of
halfsmiling
meditation
he
pursued
it
was
one
mayday
and
there
was
some
sun
and
there
was
a
smell
of
spring
in
the
air
which
we
felt
even
in
that
dirty
place
ah
how
i
remember
me
of
it
all
i
was
sitting
against
the
wall
in
the
courtyard
with
two
others
who
were
bretons
like
you
and
me
mademoiselle
shifting
with
the
sun
now
and
then
for
you
must
know
a
prisoner
loves
the
sun
above
all
and
there
we
only
had
it
a
few
hours
in
the
day
even
when
it
did
shine
i
was
carving
some
stickheads
and
breadplates
in
woodthe
only
thing
i
could
do
to
put
a
little
more
than
bread
into
our
own
platters
with
a
grin
and
whistling
whistling
for
if
you
cant
be
gay
it
is
best
to
play
at
it
well
that
day
into
our
courtyard
there
was
shown
a
tall
manand
i
knew
him
at
once
though
he
was
different
enough
in
his
fine
coat
and
hat
and
boots
from
the
time
when
i
had
last
seen
him
when
he
was
like
me
in
rags
and
with
a
woollen
cap
on
his
head
and
no
stockings
under
his
shoesi
knew
him
at
once
and
when
i
saw
him
i
stood
still
with
my
mouth
round
but
not
whistling
more
my
blood
went
phizz
phizz
all
over
my
body
and
suddenly
something
said
in
my
head
ren
he
has
come
to
look
for
you
he
was
searching
for
some
one
for
he
went
round
with
the
guardian
looking
into
each
mans
face
and
giving
money
to
all
who
beggedand
seeing
that
they
all
got
up
and
surrounded
him
and
he
gave
them
each
a
piece
but
i
could
not
get
up
it
was
as
if
some
one
had
cut
out
my
knees
and
my
elbows
and
that
was
how
he
saw
me
the
sooner
he
noticed
i
remained
there
looking
at
him
like
a
dog
saying
nothing
when
he
saw
me
he
stood
a
moment
quite
quiet
and
without
pretending
anything
he
came
to
me
and
looked
down
smilingbut
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
know
this
man
he
said
to
the
guardian
pretending
to
be
astonished
why
this
is
ren
laptre
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
here
ren
laptre
says
he
and
then
he
smiled
again
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
i
have
come
at
last
ren
and
once
more
as
if
to
explain
i
have
only
lately
come
back
to
england
in
a
gentle
way
all
full
of
meaning
i
dont
know
what
took
me
but
i
cried
like
an
infant
in
my
cap
and
the
guardian
and
some
of
the
others
laughed
but
when
i
looked
up
again
his
eyes
shone
also
he
looked
so
good
so
kind
mademoiselle
that
it
was
as
if
i
understood
in
words
all
he
meant
but
thought
better
not
to
say
at
the
time
then
he
spoke
to
the
guardian
who
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
after
saying
have
good
courage
ren
laptre
and
giving
me
the
rest
of
his
money
he
went
awaybut
i
knew
i
was
not
forgotten
and
i
was
so
happy
that
the
black
black
walls
were
no
more
black
and
i
sang
not
for
pretence
this
time
ah
no
and
i
spent
all
my
money
in
buying
a
dinner
for
those
at
our
end
of
the
prison
and
we
even
had
wine
you
may
be
sure
we
drank
to
his
happiness
here
the
man
carried
away
by
his
feelings
seized
his
hat
and
waved
it
in
the
air
then
ashamed
of
his
ebullition
halted
and
glanced
diffidently
at
the
young
lady
but
molly
only
smiled
in
encouragement
well
and
then
she
asked
well
mademoiselle
he
resumed
it
was
long
before
i
saw
him
again
but
i
kept
good
courage
as
i
was
told
one
day
at
last
the
guardian
came
to
fetch
me
and
took
me
to
the
governors
cabinet
and
my
master
was
therei
was
told
that
my
release
had
been
obtained
though
not
without
trouble
and
that
sir
adrian
landale
of
pulwick
priory
had
gone
warranty
for
me
that
i
should
not
use
my
liberty
to
the
prejudice
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
england
and
that
i
was
to
be
grateful
to
sir
adrian
i
almost
laughed
at
him
mademoiselle
oh
he
took
care
to
advise
me
to
be
grateful
and
here
ren
paused
ironically
but
there
was
a
quiver
on
his
lips
ah
he
little
knew
monsieur
the
governor
that
when
my
master
had
taken
me
to
an
inn
and
the
door
was
closed
over
the
private
room
he
who
had
looked
so
grand
and
careless
before
the
governor
took
me
by
both
hands
and
then
in
his
fine
clothes
embraced
meme
the
dirty
prisonerjust
as
he
did
when
he
left
me
in
the
old
days
and
was
as
poor
and
ragged
as
i
was
and
let
me
weep
there
on
his
breast
for
i
had
to
weep
or
my
heart
would
have
broken
but
i
wander
mademoiselle
you
only
wanted
to
know
how
i
came
to
be
in
his
service
still
that
is
how
it
was
as
i
tell
you
molly
was
moved
by
this
artless
account
of
fidelity
and
gratitude
and
as
she
walked
on
in
attentive
silence
ren
went
on
it
was
then
his
honour
made
me
know
how
only
by
accident
and
months
after
his
own
return
he
chanced
to
hear
of
the
letter
that
some
one
had
sent
to
mr
landale
from
the
tower
of
liverpool
and
that
mr
landale
had
said
he
knew
nothing
of
any
french
prisoner
and
had
thought
it
great
impudence
indeed
and
how
hemy
masterhad
suddenly
thought
though
my
letter
had
been
destroyed
that
it
might
be
from
me
the
servant
of
my
lady
your
mother
and
his
old
companion
in
arms
for
his
honour
will
always
call
me
so
he
could
not
sleep
he
told
me
till
he
had
found
out
he
started
for
liverpool
that
very
night
and
having
discovered
that
it
was
me
mademoiselle
he
never
rested
till
he
had
obtained
my
liberty





walking
slowly
in
the
winter
sunshine
the
one
talking
volubly
the
other
intently
listening
the
odd
pair
had
reached
a
rising
knoll
in
the
park
where
under
the
shelter
of
a
cluster
of
firs
stood
a
row
of
carved
stone
seats
that
had
once
been
sedillas
in
the
dismantled
priory
church
from
this
secluded
spot
could
be
obtained
the
most
superb
view
of
the
whole
countryside
at
the
end
of
the
green
gentlysloping
stretch
of
pastureland
which
extended
broken
only
by
irregular
clusters
of
trees
down
to
the
low
cliffs
forming
the
boundary
of
the
strand
lay
the
wide
expanse
of
brown
sand
with
its
streamlets
and
salt
pools
scintillating
under
the
morning
sun
further
in
the
western
horizon
a
crescent
of
deep
blue
sea
sharply
defined
under
a
lighter
blue
sky
and
fringed
landwards
with
a
straggling
border
of
foam
advanced
slowly
to
the
daily
conquest
of
the
golden
bay
in
the
midst
of
that
frame
the
eye
was
irresistibly
drawn
as
to
the
chief
object
in
the
picture
to
the
distant
rock
of
scartheya
green
patch
with
the
jagged
red
outline
of
the
ruins
clear
cut
against
the
sky
since
this
point
of
view
in
the
park
had
been
made
known
to
her
on
the
first
day
when
she
was
piloted
through
the
grounds
molly
had
more
than
once
found
her
way
to
the
sedillas
yielding
to
the
fascination
of
the
mysterious
island
and
in
order
to
indulge
in
the
fancies
suggested
by
its
everchanging
aspect
at
the
fall
of
day
the
red
glow
of
the
sinking
sun
would
glint
through
the
dismantled
windows
and
against
the
flaming
sky
the
ruins
would
stand
out
black
and
grim
suggesting
nought
but
abandonment
and
desolation
until
suddenly
as
the
gloom
gathered
upon
the
bay
the
light
of
the
lamp
springing
to
the
beacon
tower
would
reverse
the
impression
and
bring
to
mind
a
picture
of
faithful
and
patient
watching
when
the
sun
was
still
in
the
ascendant
the
island
would
be
green
and
fresh
to
the
gaze
evoking
no
dismal
impression
and
as
the
rays
glanced
back
from
the
two
or
three
glazed
windows
and
from
the
roofed
beacontower
the
little
estate
wore
a
look
of
solid
security
and
privacy
in
spite
of
its
crumbling
walls
which
was
almost
as
tantalising
to
her
romantic
curiosity
it
was
with
ulterior
motives
therefore
that
she
had
again
wended
her
way
to
the
knoll
this
sunny
breezy
morning
she
now
sat
down
and
let
her
eyes
wander
over
the
wide
panorama
whilst
ren
stood
at
a
humble
distance
looking
with
eyes
of
delight
from
her
to
the
distant
abode
of
his
master
and
now
you
live
with
sir
adrian
in
that
little
isle
yonder
said
she
at
length
how
came
it
that
you
never
sought
to
go
back
to
your
country
there
was
the
war
then
mademoiselle
and
it
was
difficult
to
return
but
there
has
been
peace
these
six
months
insisted
molly
yes
mademoiselle
though
i
only
learned
it
yesterday
but
then
bah
what
is
that
his
honour
needs
me
i
have
stopped
with
him
seven
years
and
my
faith
i
shall
stop
with
him
for
ever
there
was
a
long
silence
does
any
one
know
asked
molly
at
length
with
a
vague
air
of
addressing
the
trees
mindful
as
she
spoke
of
the
manner
in
which
mr
landale
had
practically
dismissed
her
and
her
sister
at
a
certain
point
of
his
version
of
his
brothers
history
why
sir
adrian
has
shut
himself
up
in
that
place
instead
of
living
at
the
hall
all
this
time
a
certain
dignity
seemed
to
come
over
the
servants
squat
figure
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
very
simply
his
honest
eyes
fixed
upon
the
girls
face
i
am
only
his
humble
servant
mademoiselle
and
it
is
enough
for
me
that
it
is
his
pleasure
to
live
alone
you
are
indeed
faithful
said
molly
with
a
little
generous
flush
of
shame
at
this
peasants
delicacy
compared
to
her
own
curiosity
and
after
another
pause
she
added
pensively
but
tell
me
does
sir
adrian
never
leave
his
solitude
i
confess
i
should
like
to
meet
one
who
had
known
my
mother
who
could
talk
of
her
to
me
ren
looked
at
the
young
girl
with
a
wistful
countenance
as
though
the
question
had
embarked
him
on
a
new
train
of
thought
but
he
answered
evasively
his
honour
comes
rarely
to
pulwickrarely
molly
with
a
little
movement
of
pique
rose
abruptly
from
her
seat
but
quickly
changing
her
mood
again
she
turned
round
as
she
was
about
to
depart
and
smiling
thank
you
ren
she
said
and
held
out
her
dainty
hand
which
he
blushing
engulfed
in
his
great
paw
i
am
going
in
i
am
dreadfully
hungry
we
shall
be
here
two
months
or
more
and
i
shall
want
to
see
you
again

if
you
come
back
to
pulwick
she
walked
quickly
away
towards
the
house
ren
followed
the
retreating
figure
with
a
meditative
look
so
long
as
he
could
keep
her
in
sight
then
turned
his
gaze
to
the
island
and
there
stood
lost
in
a
deep
muse
regardless
of
the
fact
that
his
sweetheart
moggie
was
awaiting
a
parting
interview
at
the
lodge
and
that
the
tide
that
would
wait
for
no
man
was
swelling
under
his
boat
upon
the
beach





a
sudden
resolution
was
formed
in
mollys
mind
as
the
immediate
result
of
this
conversation
and
she
framed
her
behaviour
that
morning
solely
with
a
view
to
its
furtherance
breakfast
was
over
when
glowing
from
her
morning
walk
she
entered
the
diningroom
but
regardless
of
mr
landales
pointedly
elaborate
courtesy
in
insisting
upon
a
fresh
repast
being
brought
to
her
his
sarcastically
overacted
solicitude
intended
to
point
out
what
a
deal
of
avoidable
trouble
she
gave
to
the
household
molly
remained
perfectly
gracious
and
ate
the
good
things
plaintively
set
before
her
by
miss
landale
with
the
most
perfect
appetite
and
good
humour
she
expatiated
in
terms
of
enthusiasm
on
the
beauty
of
the
estate
and
the
delight
of
her
morning
exploration
and
concluded
this
condescending
account
of
her
doings
in
which
the
meeting
with
ren
did
not
figure
with
a
request
that
mr
landale
should
put
horses
at
the
disposal
of
herself
and
her
sister
for
a
riding
excursion
that
very
afternoon
and
with
determined
energy
she
carried
the
point
declaring
despite
his
prognostications
of
coming
bad
weather
that
the
sunshine
would
last
the
day
in
this
wise
was
brought
about
the
eventful
ride
which
cost
the
life
of
lucifer
and
introduced
such
heartstirring
phantasmagories
into
the
even
tenor
of
sir
adrian
landales
seclusion





that
evening
the
news
rapidly
spread
throughout
pulwick
that
the
cruel
sands
of
the
bay
had
secured
yet
another
victim
in
an
almost
fainting
condition
speechless
with
horror
and
hardly
able
yet
to
realise
to
the
full
her
own
anguish
madeleine
was
conducted
by
the
terrified
groom
through
the
howling
wind
and
drenching
rain
back
to
the
priory
and
there
between
the
fearful
outcries
of
miss
landale
and
the
deep
frowning
gravity
of
her
brother
the
man
stammered
out
his
talehow
the
young
lady
when
the
rain
first
began
had
insisted
notwithstanding
his
remonstrances
upon
taking
the
causeway
to
the
island
and
how
it
was
actually
by
force
that
he
prevented
the
other
lady
from
following
so
soon
as
she
understood
the
danger
into
which
her
sister
was
running
there
was
no
use
he
had
thought
explained
the
man
half
apologetically
for
two
more
to
throw
away
their
lives
just
for
no
good
that
way
and
so
they
had
sat
on
their
horses
and
watched
in
terror
as
well
as
they
could
through
the
torrents
of
rain
they
had
seen
in
the
distance
lucifer
break
from
the
young
ladys
control
and
swerve
from
the
advancing
sea
and
then
had
come
the
great
gust
that
blew
the
rain
and
the
sand
in
their
faces
and
set
their
horses
dancing
and
when
they
could
see
again
all
traces
of
horse
and
rider
had
disappeared
and
there
lay
nothing
before
them
but
the
advancing
tide
though
the
island
and
its
tower
were
still
just
visible
through
the
storm
no
amount
of
crossexamination
could
elicit
any
further
information
the
girls
impulse
seemed
to
have
been
quite
sudden
and
she
had
only
laughed
back
at
the
groom
over
her
shoulder
upon
his
earnest
shout
of
warning
though
she
had
probably
expected
them
to
follow
her
and
as
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
calamity
which
had
ensued
and
no
possible
rescue
even
of
the
body
he
had
returned
home
at
once
to
bring
the
disastrous
news
madeleine
had
been
carried
completely
unconscious
to
her
bed
but
presently
miss
sophia
was
summoned
to
her
side
as
the
girl
showed
signs
of
returning
animation
and
rupert
was
left
alone
he
fell
to
pacing
the
room
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
complicated
and
farreaching
reflections
beyond
doubt
he
was
shocked
and
distressed
by
the
sudden
and
horrible
disaster
and
yet
as
an
undercurrent
to
these
first
natural
thoughts
there
ran
presently
a
distinct
notion
that
he
would
have
felt
the
grievousness
of
it
more
keenly
had
madeleine
perished
in
that
cruel
manner
and
her
sister
survived
to
bring
the
tale
home
the
antagonism
which
his
cousin
in
all
the
insolence
of
her
young
beauty
and
vigorous
selfesteem
had
shown
for
him
had
been
mutual
he
had
instinctively
felt
that
she
was
an
enemy
and
more
than
thata
danger
to
him
this
danger
was
now
removed
from
his
path
and
by
no
intervention
or
even
desire
of
his
own
the
calamity
which
had
struck
the
remaining
sister
into
such
prostration

even
if
the

was
dead
altogether
the
sum
of
his
meditations
was
assuming
a
not
unpleasing
aspect
and
the
undercurrent
in
time
assumed
almost
the
nature
of

the
ordeal
which
was

to
come
when

would
have
to
face

and
render
an
account
of
his
short
trust
could
not
weigh

down
on
the
wrong
side

thus
that

what

no

has
attempted
to
force
your
secrets
from
you
which
since
it
appears
that
it
had
been
agreed
that
molly

dead

she
is
not

she
is
very
much
alive
and
very
happy
to
be
so
this
will
indeed
be
an
adventure
worth
reading

since
after
the

caused
by

she
has
had
the
joy
of
finding
her

alive
again
things
are

i
take
it
and
all
being
well
that
ends
well
the
whole
affair
is
pleasant
to

it

decided
me
i
laid
my
plans
very
neatly
to
pay
the
recluse
a
little
visit
and
plead
necessity
for
the
intrusion
my
machinations
would
have
been
perfect
if
they
had
not
caused

unnecessary
grief
but
now
that
i
know
the
truth
i
cannot
distinctly
remember
what
it
was
that
i
did
expect
to
find
on
that
island
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
had
already
gone
through
more
excitement
than
i
bargained
for
to
reach
that
mysterious
rock
how
exciting
i
should
have
found
it
to
wander
up
to
unknown
ruins
to
knock
at
the
closed
doors
of
an
enchanted
castle
ascend
unknown
stairs
and
engage
in
devious
unknown
passagesall
the
while
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
but
when
i
dragged
myself
giddy
and
faint
from
the
boiling
breakers
and
scrambled
upon
the
desolate
island
under
the
rain
that
beat
me
like
the
lashes
of
a
whip
pushing
against
a
wind
that
bellowed
and
rushed
as
though
determined
to
thrust
me
back
to
the
waters
i
had
cheated
of
their
prey
my
only
thoughts
were
for
succour
and
shelter
such
warm
shelter
such
loving
welcome
it
was
of
course
impossible
that
i
could
for
a
moment
have
anticipated
conceive
my
dear
diary
the
feelings
of
a
poor
semidrowned
wanderer
shivering
with
cold
with
feet
torn
by
cruel
stones
who
suddenly
emerges
from
howl
and
turmoil
into
a
warm
quiet
room
to
be
received
as
a
long
and
eagerly
expected
guest
whose
advent
brings
happiness
whose
presence
is
a
highly
prized
favour
in
fact
not
as
one
who
has
to
explain
her
intrusion
but
as
one
who
in
the
situation
holds
the
upper
hand
herself
and
this
was
my
welcome
from
him
whose
absence
from
pulwick
was
more
haunting
than
any
presence
i
can
think
of
of
course
i
knew
him
at
once
even
had
i
not
expected
to
see
himhad
i
not
come
to
seek
him
in
facti
should
have
known
him
at
once
from
the
portrait
whose
melancholy
wideopen
eyes
had
followed
me
about
the
gallery
but
i
had
not
dreamed
to
see
him
so
little
altered
now
apart
from
the
dress
if
he
is
in
any
way
changed
from
the
picture
it
is
in
a
look
of
greater
youth
and
less
sombreness
the
portrait
is
handsome
but
the
original
is
better
had
it
not
been
so
i
imagine
i
might
have
felt
vastly
different
when
i
was
seized
and
enfolded
andkissed
as
it
was
i
cannot
remember
that
even
at
the
moment
of
this
extraordinary
proceeding
i
was
otherwise
than
pleased
nor
that
the
dark
hints
of
mr
landale
concerning
sir
adrians
madness
returned
to
disturb
my
mind
in
the
least
and
yet
i
found
myself
enveloped
in
great
strong
arms
out
of
which
i
could
not
have
extricated
myself
by
the
most
frantic
effortsalthough
the
folding
was
soft
and
tenderand
i
loved
that
impression
why
i
cannot
say
his
words
of
love
were
not
addressed
to
me
from
his
exclamation
i
knew
that
the
real
and
present
molly
was
not
the
true
object
of
his
sudden
ecstasy
and
yet
i
am
glad
that
this
is
the
first
man
who
has
been
able
to
kiss
molly
de
savenaye
it
is
quite
incomprehensible
i
ought
to
be
indignant
now
the
whole
secret
of
my
reception
is
plain
to
see
and
it
is
pathetic
sir
adrian
landale
was
in
love
with
my
mother
when
she
was
an
unprotected
widow
he
followed
her
to
our
own
country
if
she
had
not
died
soon
after
he
would
have
married
her
what
a
true
knight
must
this
sir
adrian
be
to
keep
so
fresh
for
twenty
years
the
remembrance
of
his
boyish
love
that
when
i
came
in
upon
him
to
look
at
him
with
her
eyes
it
was
to
find
him
pondering
upon
her
and
to
fill
his
soul
with
the
rapturous
thought
that
his
love
had
come
back
to
him
though
i
was
aware
that
all
this
fervour
was
not
addressed
to
me
there
was
something
very
gratifying
in
being
so
like
one
who
could
inspire
such
longlived
passionyes
it
was
unexpectedly
pleasant
and
comforting
to
be
so
received
and
the
tender
care
the
thoughtful
solicitude
next
bestowed
on
the
limp
and
dishevelled
waif
of
the
sea
by
my
beau
tnbreux
were
unmistakably
meant
for
molly
and
no
one
else
whatever
his
first
imaginings
may
have
been
and
they
were
quite
as
interesting
to
receive
the
halfhour
i
spent
cosily
ensconced
by
his
hands
and
waited
upon
by
his
queer
household
was
perhaps
the
best
i
have
ever
known
he
stood
by
the
fireplace
looking
down
from
his
great
height
with
a
wondering
smile
upon
me
i
declare
that
the
loving
kindness
of
his
eyes
which
he
has
wide
grey
and
beautiful
warmed
me
as
much
as
the
pyramid
of
logs
he
had
set
burning
on
the
hearth
i
took
a
good
reckoning
of
the
man
from
under
the
gigantic
collar
in
which
i
felt
my
head
rested
like
a
little
egg
at
the
bottom
of
a
warm
nest
and
so
i
thought
here
is
the
lightkeeper
of
scarthey
island
and
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
he
was
a
more
romanticlooking
person
than
even
in
my
wildest
dreams
i
had
pictured
to
myselfthat
in
fact
i
had
found
out
for
the
first
time
the
man
really
approved
of
and
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
own
clevernessfor
it
was
evident
that
just
as
i
had
suspected
from
rens
reticent
manner
even
by
him
our
existence
at
pulwick
had
not
been
mentioned
to
the
master
and
as
mr
landale
was
quite
determined
to
avail
himself
of
his
brothers
sauvagerie
not
to
let
him
know
anything
about
us
on
his
side
but
for
me
we
might
have
remained
at
and
departed
from
pulwick
unknown
to
the
head
of
the
house
and
what
a
pity
that
would
have
been
now
why
did
not
mr
landale
wish
his
brother
to
know
did
he
think
as
indeed
has
happened
that
the
lightkeeper
would
take
too
kindly
to
the
savenaye
children
or
to
one
of
them
if
so
he
will
be
bien
attrapp
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
my
sudden
and
dramatic
arrival
upon
his
especial
domain
has
made
an
impression
on
him
that
no
meeting
prepared
and
discussed
beforehand
could
have
produced
adrian
landale
may
have
been
in
love
with
our
beautiful
mamma
in
his
boyish
days
but
now
sir
adrian
the
man
is
in
love
with
the
beautiful
molly
that
is
positive
i
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
go
to
sleep
in
the
tower
it
was
too
perfect
to
be
in
bed
in
such
a
place
safe
and
happy
in
the
midst
of
the
rage
i
could
hear
outside
to
have
seen
the
unknown
to
have
found
him
such
as
he
isto
be
under
the
light
what
would
have
happened
if
my
cousin
had
really
been
mad
and
ren
his
keeper
as
that
stupid
countryside
wit
suggested
in
my
ear
the
other
night
at
dinner
it
would
have
been
still
more
of
an
adventure
of
course
but
not
one
which
even
murthering
moll
the
second
can
regret
or
if
he
had
been
a
dirty
untidy
hermit
as
madeleine
thought
that
would
have
spoilt
all
thus
in
the
owls
nest
as
mr
landale
spiteful
creature
called
it
to
tanty
there
lives
not
owl
any
more
than
lunatic
a
polished
gentleman
with
white
exquisite
hands
who
when
he
is
discovered
by
the
most
unexpected
of
visitors
is
shaven
as
smooth
as
rupert
himself
has
the
most
unexceptionable
of
snowy
linen
and
oldfashioned
it
is
true
but
most
wellfitting
clothes
as
for
the
entertainment
for
the
said
casual
visitor
not
even
pulwick
with
all
its
resources
where
housekeeping
between
the
fussy
brother
and
the
docile
sister
is
a
complicated
science
could
have
produced
more
real
comfort
in
the
morning
when
i
woke
late
it
was
broad
daylight
feeling
as
if
i
had
been
beaten
and
passed
through
a
mangle
for
there
was
not
an
inch
of
my
poor
body
that
was
not
sore
i
had
not
turned
round
and
so
given
sign
of
life
before
i
heard
a
whisper
outside
my
door
then
comes
a
sturdy
knock
and
in
walks
old
margery
still
dignified
as
a
queens
housekeeper
bearing
a
bowl
of
warm
frothy
milk
and
this
being
gratefully
drunk
by
me
she
gravely
inquires
in
her
queer
provincial
accent
how
i
am
this
morn
and
then
goes
to
report
to
some
anxious
inquirer
whomi
can
easily
guess
that
with
the
exception
of
my
cut
foot
i
am
very
well
presently
she
returns
and
lights
a
blazing
fire
then
in
come
my
dress
and
linen
and
my
one
shoe
all
cleaned
dried
and
mended
only
my
poor
habit
is
so
torn
and
so
stiff
that
i
have
to
put
up
with
margerys
best
striped
skirt
in
lieu
of
it
till
she
has
time
to
mend
and
wash
it
as
it
is
she
must
have
been
at
work
all
night
upon
these
repairs
for
me
again
she
goes
outfor
another
consultation
i
supposeand
comes
back
to
find
me
half
clad
hopping
about
the
room
this
time
she
has
got
nice
white
linen
bandages
and
with
them
ties
up
my
little
foot
partly
for
the
cuts
partly
for
want
of
a
sandal
till
it
is
twice
the
size
of
its
companion
but
i
can
walk
on
it
then
my
strange
handmaidwho
by
the
way
is
a
droll
grumbling
old
soul
and
orders
me
about
as
if
she
were
still
my
nursedresses
me
and
combs
my
hair
which
will
not
yet
awhile
be
rid
of
all
its
sand
and
so
in
due
course
molly
emerges
from
her
bower
as
well
tended
almost
as
she
might
have
been
at
bath
except
that
margerys
striped
skirt
is
a
deal
too
short
for
her
and
she
displays
a
little
more
of
one
very
nice
ankle
and
one
gouty
foot
than
fashion
warrants
and
in
this
manner
the
guest
goes
to
meet
her
host
in
the
great
room
he
was
walking
up
and
down
as
if
impatiently
expecting
me
and
when
i
hobbled
in
he
came
forward
with
a
smile
on
his
face
which
once
more
i
thought
beautiful
god
be
praised
he
said
taking
both
my
hands
and
kissing
one
of
them
with
his
fine
air
of
gallantry
which
was
all
the
more
delightful
on
account
of
his
evident
earnestness
you
seem
none
the
worse
for
this
terrible
adventure
i
dreaded
this
morning
to
hear
that
you
were
in
a
fever
you
know
he
added
so
seriously
that
i
had
to
smile
you
might
easily
have
had
a
fever
from
this
yesterdays
work
and
what
should
we
have
done
without
doctor
and
medicines
you
have
a
good
surgeon
at
least
said
i
laughing
and
pointing
at
my
swaddled
extremity
he
laughed
too
at
the
enmitouflage
i
tried
to
explain
how
it
was
to
be
done
he
said
but
i
think
i
could
have
managed
it
more
neatly
myself
then
he
helped
me
to
the
armchair
and
ren
came
in
and
after
a
profound
bow
which
did
not
preclude
much
staring
and
smiling
at
me
afterwards
laid
on
a
dazzling
tablecloth
a
most
tempting
breakfast
explaining
the
while
in
his
odd
english
the
bread
is
stale
for
we
bake
only
twice
a
month
but
there
are
some
cakes
hot
from
the
fire
some
eggs
new
laid
last
evening
some
fresh
milk
some
tea
it
was
a
happy
thing
i
arrived
yesterday
for
there
was
no
more
tea
the
butter
wants
but
mistress
margery
will
have
some
made
tomorrow
so
that
the
demoiselle
will
not
leave
without
having
tasted
our
scarthey
butter
all
the
while
sir
adrian
looked
on
with
a
sort
of
dreamy
smilea
happy
smile
poor
ren
he
said
when
the
man
had
left
the
room
one
would
think
that
you
have
brought
to
him
almost
as
much
joy
as
to
me
i
wondered
what
mr
landale
would
have
said
had
he
through
some
magic
glass
been
able
to
see
this
little
feast
i
never
enjoyed
a
meal
more
as
for
my
host
he
hardly
touched
anything
but
i
could
see
was
all
absorbed
in
the
delight
of
looking
at
me
and
this
he
showed
quite
openly
in
the
most
childlike
manner
not
one
of
the
many
fine
gentlemen
it
has
been
my
fate
to
meet
in
my
six
months
apprenticeship
to
the
great
world
not
cousin
rupert
himself
with
all
his
elaborate
politeness
and
rupert
has
de
grandes
manires
as
tanty
says
could
have
played
the
host
with
a
more
exquisite
courtesy
and
more
true
hospitality
so
i
thought
at
least
now
and
again
it
is
true
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
i
would
see
how
the
soul
behind
them
was
away
far
in
the
past
and
then
at
a
word
even
at
a
movement
back
it
would
come
to
me
with
the
tenderest
softening
i
have
ever
seen
upon
a
human
face





it
was
only
at
the
end
of
breakfast
that
he
suddenly
adverted
to
the
previous
day
of
course
he
said
hesitatingly
but
keeping
a
frank
gaze
on
mine
you
must
have
thought
me
demented
whenwhen
you
first
entered
yesterday
now
i
had
anticipated
this
apology
as
inevitable
and
i
was
prepared
to
put
him
at
his
ease
i
not
at
all
i
said
quite
gravely
and
seeing
the
puzzled
expression
that
came
upon
his
face
i
hastened
to
add
in
lower
tones
i
know
i
am
very
like
my
mother
and
it
was
her
name
you
called
out
upon
seeing
me
and
then
i
stopped
as
if
that
had
explained
everything
he
looked
at
me
with
a
wondering
air
and
fell
again
into
a
muse
after
a
while
he
said
with
his
great
simplicity
which
seems
somehow
in
him
the
last
touch
of
the
most
perfect
breeding
yes
such
an
apparition
was
enough
to
unhinge
any
ones
mind
for
the
moment
you
never
knew
her
child
and
therefore
never
mourned
her
death
but
wethat
is
ren
and
i
who
tried
so
hard
to
save
herthough
it
is
so
long
ago
we
have
not
forgotten
it
was
then
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
about
the
mother
i
had
never
known
at
first
it
was
as
if
he
could
not
he
fell
into
a
great
silence
through
which
i
could
feel
the
working
of
his
old
sorrow
so
then
i
said
to
him
quickly
for
i
feared
he
thought
me
an
indiscreet
trespasser
upon
sacred
ground
that
he
must
remember
my
right
to
know
more
than
the
vague
accounts
i
had
been
given
of
my
mothers
history
no
one
will
tell
me
of
her
i
said
it
is
hard
for
i
am
her
own
daughter
it
is
wrong
he
said
very
gently
you
ought
to
know
for
you
are
indeed
most
verily
her
own
daughter
and
then
by
fragments
he
tried
to
tell
me
a
little
of
her
beauty
her
loving
heart
her
faithfulness
and
bravery
at
first
it
was
with
great
tripping
sighs
as
if
the
words
hurt
him
but
by
and
by
it
came
easier
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
wistfully
on
me
he
took
me
as
it
were
by
his
side
through
all
their
marvellous
adventures
and
thus
i
heard
the
stirring
story
of
the
savenaye
band
and
i
felt
prouder
of
my
race
than
i
had
ever
been
before
hitherto
being
a
savenaye
only
meant
the
pride
our
aunt
tried
to
instil
into
us
of
being
undeniably
biennes
and
connected
with
numbers
of
great
families
but
the
tale
of
the
deeds
mine
had
done
for
the
kings
cause
and
especially
the
achievements
of
my
own
mother
in
starting
such
an
expedition
after
my
fathers
death
and
following
its
fortunes
to
the
bitter
end
made
my
blood
tingle
with
a
new
emotion
little
wonder
that
sir
adrian
should
have
devoted
his
life
to
her
service
how
madly
enthralled
i
should
have
been
being
a
man
and
free
and
strong
by
the
presence
of
a
woman
such
as
my
mother
i
too
would
have
prostrated
myself
to
worship
her
image
returning
to
lifeand
i
am
that
living
living
portrait
when
he
came
to
the
story
of
her
death
he
hesitated
and
finally
stopped
it
must
have
been
horrible
i
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
and
i
dared
not
press
him
now
i
suppose
i
am
the
only
one
in
the
world
besides
ren
who
knows
this
man
as
he
is
and
i
am
proud
of
it
and
it
is
for
this
constancy
which
no
vulgar
soul
of
them
can
understand
that
rupert
and
his
class
have
dubbed
the
gallant
gentleman
a
madman
it
fills
me
with
scorn
of
them
i
do
not
yet
know
what
love
is
therefore
of
course
i
cannot
fathom
its
grief
but
this
much
i
knowthat
if
i
loved
and
yet
could
not
reach
as
high
as
ever
love
may
reach
both
in
joy
and
sorrow
i
should
despise
myself
i
too
would
draw
the
utmost
from
life
that
life
can
give
he
never
even
hinted
at
his
love
for
my
mother
speaking
of
himself
throughout
as
ren
might
as
of
her
humble
devoted
servant
merely
and
then
the
question
began
to
gnaw
at
me
did
she
love
him
and
somehow
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
rest
till
i
knew
and
i
had
it
on
my
lips
twenty
times
to
cry
out
to
him
i
know
you
loved
her
oh
tell
me
did
she
love
you
and
yet
i
dared
no
more
have
done
so
and
overstepped
the
barrier
of
his
gentle
reticent
dignity
than
i
could
have
thrust
the
lighthouse
tower
down
and
i
could
not
think
either
whether
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
that
she
had
loved
him
or
that
she
had
not
not
even
here
alone
with
myself
can
i
answer
that
question
but
though
i
respect
him
because
he
is
as
i
have
found
him
and
understand
how
rare
a
personality
it
takes
to
achieve
such
refinement
of
faithfulness
it
seems
to
me
that
to
teach
this
constant
lover
to
forget
the
past
in
the
present
would
be
something
worth
living
forsomething
worthy
of
me
mollywhat
is
the
meaning
of
this
you
have
never
before
put
that
thought
in
words
even
to
yourself
but
let
me
be
frank
or
else
what
is
the
use
of
this
diary
looking
back
to
those
delightful
three
days
did
not
the
thought
come
to
me
if
not
the
words
well
well
it
is
better
sometimes
i
believe
to
let
oneself
drift
than
to
try
and
guide
the
boat
and
i
must
hurry
back
to
scarthey
or
i
shall
never
have
told
my
story
how
swiftly
time
had
flown
by
us
i
sitting
in
the
armchair
with
the
old
dogs
muzzle
on
my
lap
and
sir
adrian
standing
by
his
great
chimney
the
clock
struck
twelve
in
the
midst
of
the
long
silence
and
i
had
thought
that
barely
an
hour
had
passed
i
got
up
and
seeing
me
limp
in
my
attempt
to
walk
sir
adrian
gave
me
his
arm
and
so
we
went
round
the
great
room
bras
dessus
bras
dessous
and
it
already
seemed
quite
natural
to
feel
like
an
intimate
friend
in
that
queer
dwelling
we
paused
a
long
time
in
silence
by
the
window
the
tempest
wind
was
still
raging
but
the
sky
was
clear
and
all
round
us
was
a
wonderful
sight
the
sea
as
far
as
eyes
could
reach
white
with
foam
lashed
and
tossing
in
frenzy
round
the
rock
on
which
we
stood
so
safely
and
rising
in
long
jets
of
spray
which
now
and
then
dashed
as
far
as
our
window
and
when
i
looked
down
nearer
i
could
see
the
little
stunted
trees
bending
backwards
and
forwards
under
the
blast
and
an
odd
idea
came
to
my
mindthey
looked
to
me
when
they
caught
my
sight
as
though
they
were
bowing
deep
hurriedly
and
frantically
greeting
me
among
them
i
glanced
up
at
my
silent
companion
the
true
knight
and
found
his
wide
grey
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
the
same
expression
that
was
already
familiar
to
me
which
i
had
especially
noted
as
he
told
me
his
long
tale
of
olden
times
this
time
i
felt
the
look
go
to
my
heart
and
then
the
thought
first
came
to
my
mind
all
unformed
but
still
sweet
i
dont
know
exactly
why
but
in
answer
to
his
sad
look
i
smiled
at
him
without
a
word
upon
which
he
suddenly
grew
pale
after
a
while
he
gave
a
sigh
and
as
he
drew
my
arm
again
through
his
i
fancy
his
hand
trembled
a
little
when
he
had
taken
me
back
to
my
chair
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
silence
looking
at
me
ever
and
anon
a
long
time
we
passed
thus
without
speaking
but
it
seemed
as
if
our
thoughts
were
intermixing
in
harmony
in
the
midst
of
our
silence
and
then
the
spell
was
broken
by
ren
who
never
came
in
without
making
me
his
great
scrape
trying
hard
not
to
beam
too
obtrusively
in
the
delight
that
evidently
overtakes
him
whenever
he
sets
eyes
on
me
it
was
after
a
prolonged
talk
between
him
and
the
master
i
fancy
concerning
the
means
of
attending
fitly
upon
my
noble
and
delicate
person
that
sir
adrian
brought
back
evidently
to
the
consideration
of
present
affairs
began
to
be
exercised
about
the
best
means
of
whiling
away
my
time
when
he
hinted
at
the
difficulty
i
very
soon
disposed
of
it
i
told
him
i
had
never
been
so
happy
in
my
life
beforethat
the
hours
went
all
too
quicklyi
told
him
there
was
so
much
he
and
ren
had
yet
to
tell
me
of
their
wonderful
adventures
that
i
thought
i
should
have
to
carry
them
back
to
pulwick
with
me
at
the
mention
of
pulwick
his
brow
darkened
and
ren
turned
away
to
cough
into
his
hand
and
i
saw
that
i
had
gone
too
fast
nbpulwick
is
evidently
a
sore
subject
i
am
sure
i
am
not
surprised
i
can
conceive
how
rupert
and
sophia
would
drive
a
man
of
sir
adrians
sensitiveness
nearly
to
desperation
yet
i
have
brought
sir
adrian
back
to
pulwick
in
spite
of
all
is
not
that
a
feather
in
my
cap
but
to
return
i
next
made
ren
laugh
aloud
and
sir
adrian
give
his
indulgent
smilesuch
as
a
father
might
give
to
his
childby
adding
that
when
i
was
bored
i
would
soon
let
them
know
i
always
do
i
said
for
i
consider
that
a
duty
to
myself
god
knows
said
this
strange
man
then
half
smiling
i
would
we
could
keep
you
here
for
ever
it
was
almost
a
declaration
but
his
eyes
were
far
offit
was
not
addressed
to
me
i
soon
found
that
the
recollection
of
all
the
extraordinary
incidents
sir
adrian
had
lived
through
is
one
neither
of
pride
nor
pleasure
to
him
but
all
the
same
never
has
anything
in
books
seemed
to
me
so
stirring
as
the
tale
of
relentless
fate
of
everrecurring
battles
and
struggles
and
misfortunes
told
by
the
man
who
still
in
the
strength
of
life
has
now
chosen
to
forego
everything
that
might
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
have
compensated
him
willing
as
he
was
to
humour
me
however
and
disproportionately
anxious
to
amuse
me
it
was
little
more
than
the
dry
bones
of
his
history
i
was
able
to
obtain
from
him
with
rens
help
however
and
my
own
lively
imagination
i
have
been
able
to
piece
together
a
very
wonderful
skeleton
from
these
same
dry
bones
and
moreover
endow
it
with
flesh
and
blood
and
life
ren
was
very
willing
to
descant
upon
his
masters
exploits
as
far
as
he
knew
them
whew
mademoiselle
should
have
seen
him
fight
he
would
say
a
lion
mademoiselle
a
real
lion
and
then
i
would
contrast
the
reposeful
somewhat
immobile
countenance
the
dreaming
eye
the
almost
womanly
softness
of
his
smile
with
the
picture
and
find
the
contrast
piquant
in
the
extreme
concerning
his
present
home
sir
adrian
was
more
willing
to
speaki
had
told
him
how
the
light
on
the
little
island
had
fascinated
me
from
the
distance
and
all
the
surmises
i
had
made
about
it
and
so
it
was
in
order
to
see
what
sort
of
dungeon
they
kept
the
madman
in
he
said
laughing
quietly
that
you
pushed
the
reconnaissance
which
nearly
sent
you
into
the
jaws
of
death
i
was
so
struck
at
first
by
his
speaking
of
himself
as
the
reputed
madman
that
i
could
not
answer
to
think
of
him
as
serenely
contemptuous
of
the
worlds
imputationand
an
imputation
so
galling
as
this
one
of
being
irresponsible
for
his
actionsand
deliberately
continuing
his
even
way
without
taking
the
trouble
to
refute
it
has
given
me
an
insight
into
his
nature
that
fills
me
with
admiration
and
yet
at
the
same
time
with
a
sort
of
longing
to
see
him
reinstated
in
his
proper
place
and
casting
out
those
slandering
interlopers
but
as
he
was
waiting
to
be
answered
i
had
to
collect
my
thoughts
and
admit
not
without
a
little
bashfulness
that
my
first
account
of
my
exploit
had
contained
a
slight
prevarication
in
all
he
has
to
say
about
his
little
scarthey
domain
about
the
existence
he
has
made
for
himself
there
i
cannot
help
noticing
with
what
affection
he
speaks
of
ren
ren
according
to
sir
adrian
is
everything
and
everywhere
a
perfect
familiar
genius
he
is
counsellor
as
well
as
valet
plays
his
masters
game
of
chess
as
well
as
shaves
him
can
tune
his
organ
and
manage
his
boat
and
cast
his
nets
for
he
is
fisherman
as
well
as
gardener
he
is
the
steward
of
this
wonderful
little
estate
and
its
stock
of
one
pony
one
cow
and
twelve
hens
he
tends
the
light
and
can
cook
a
dinner
a
great
deal
better
than
his
great
rival
old
margery
of
this
last
accomplishment
we
had
good
proof
in
the
shape
of
various
dainties
that
appeared
at
our
dinner
for
when
i
exclaimed
in
astonishment
the
master
said
well
pleased
and
pointing
to
the
attentive
majordomo
this
is
rens
way
of
spoiling
me
but
now
he
has
surpassed
himself
to
celebrate
so
unique
an
occasion
and
rens
face
was
all
one
grin
of
rapture
i
observe
that
on
occasions
his
eyes
wander
quite
tenderly
from
me
to
his
master
shall
i
ever
enjoy
dinners
again
like
those
in
that
old
ruined
tower
or
hours
like
those
during
which
i
listened
to
tales
of
peril
and
adventure
or
to
the
music
that
pealed
forth
from
the
distant
corner
when
sir
adrian
sat
down
to
his
organ
and
made
it
speak
the
wordless
language
of
the
soul
that
language
that
made
me
at
times
shiver
with
a
mad
yearning
for
life
more
life
at
times
soothed
my
heart
with
a
caress
of
infinite
softness
how
is
it
that
our
organsongs
at
the
convent
never
moved
me
in
this
fashion
ah
those
will
be
days
to
remember
all
the
more
for
being
certain
that
they
will
not
be
forgotten
by
him
yes
those
days
have
brought
some
light
into
his
melancholy
life
even
ren
knows
that
oh
my
lady
said
he
to
me
as
he
was
leaving
the
island
yesterday
you
have
come
like
the
good
fairy
you
have
brought
back
the
joy
of
life
to
his
honour
i
have
not
heard
him
really
laughbefore
this
year
passed
i
did
not
believe
he
knew
any
more
how
to
laughwhat
you
can
call
laugh
it
is
quite
true
i
had
made
some
droll
remark
about
tanty
and
cousin
sophia
and
when
he
laughed
he
looked
like
a
young
man
he
was
quick
enough
in
grasping
at
a
pretext
for
keeping
me
yet
another
day
yesterday
the
wind
having
suddenly
abated
in
the
night
there
was
quite
a
bevy
of
little
fishingboats
sailing
merrily
away
and
the
causeway
at
low
water
was
quite
visible
as
we
looked
out
i
know
the
same
idea
came
to
both
our
minds
though
there
was
no
word
between
us
at
last
it
was
i
who
spoke
the
crossing
is
quite
safe
said
i
and
i
added
as
he
answered
nothing
i
almost
wish
now
it
was
not
how
quick
the
time
has
gone
by
here
his
countenance
when
i
looked
up
was
darker
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
in
the
distance
at
last
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
i
suppose
it
is
high
time
you
should
go
back
i
am
sure
i
dont
wish
it
i
said
quite
franklyhe
is
not
the
sort
of
man
with
whom
one
would
ever
think
of
minauderie
but
madeleine
will
be
miserable
about
me
and
so
you
would
really
care
to
stop
here
said
he
with
a
smile
of
wonder
on
his
face
if
it
were
not
for
that
reason
naturally
i
would
said
i
i
feel
already
as
cosy
as
a
tame
cat
here
and
if
it
were
not
for
madeleine
poor
little
madeleine
who
must
be
breaking
her
heartbut
then
how
can
i
go
backi
have
no
wraps
and
only
one
shoe
his
face
had
cleared
again
he
was
walking
up
and
down
in
his
usual
way
whilst
i
hopped
back
with
more
limping
than
was
at
all
necessary
to
my
favourite
armchair
true
true
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
you
cannot
walk
with
one
shoe
and
a
bandaged
foot
and
your
clothes
are
too
thin
for
the
roundabout
sea
journey
in
this
cold
wind
this
is
what
we
shall
do
child
he
went
on
coming
up
to
me
with
a
sage
expression
that
struggled
with
his
evident
eager
desire
ren
shall
go
off
as
soon
as
the
tide
permits
carrying
the
good
news
of
your
safety
to
your
sister
and
bring
back
some
warm
things
for
you
to
wear
tomorrow
morning
and
i
shall
write
to
rupert
to
send
a
carriage
to
wait
for
you
on
the
strand
and
so
pleased
like
two
children
who
have
found
a
means
of
securing
a
further
holiday
we
wrote
both
our
letters
i
wonder
whether
it
occurred
to
sir
adrian
as
it
did
to
me
that
if
we
had
been
so
very
anxious
that
i
should
be
restored
to
the
care
of
pulwick
with
the
briefest
delay
i
might
have
gone
with
ren
that
same
day
wrapped
up
in
a
certain
cloak
which
had
done
good
warming
service
already
and
that
as
ren
had
constructed
with
his
cunning
hands
a
sufficient
if
not
very
pretty
sandal
for
my
damaged
foot
out
of
some
old
piece
of
felt
i
might
have
walked
from
the
beach
to
the
fishing
village
and
that
there
no
doubt
a
cart
or
a
donkey
might
have
conveyed
me
home
in
triumph
perhaps
it
did
not
occur
to
him
and
certainly
i
had
no
desire
to
suggest
it
on
my
side
thus
soon
after
midday
master
ren
departed
alone
and
sir
adrian
and
i
both
very
glad
of
our
reprieve
watched
leaning
side
by
side
upon
the
windowsill
the
brave
little
craft
glide
away
on
the
still
ruffled
waters
until
when
it
had
grown
very
small
in
the
distance
we
saw
the
sail
lowered
and
knew
ren
had
reached
mainland
and
that
was
perhaps
the
best
day
of
the
three
ren
having
been
unexpectedly
despatched
we
had
to
help
to
do
everything
ourselves
with
old
margery
who
is
rather
feeble
the
sky
was
clear
and
beautiful
and
followed
gravely
by
jem
the
dog
we
went
round
the
little
outer
domain
i
fed
the
hens
and
sir
adrian
carried
the
pail
when
margery
had
milked
the
cow
we
paid
a
visit
in
his
wide
paddock
to
the
pony
who
trotted
up
to
his
master
whinnying
with
pleasure
we
looked
at
the
waters
rushing
past
like
a
mill
race
on
the
further
side
of
the
island
as
the
tide
was
rising
and
he
explained
to
me
that
it
was
this
rush
which
makes
the
neighbourhood
of
scarthey
so
dangerous
to
unwary
crafts
we
went
down
into
the
seacaves
which
penetrate
deep
under
the
ruinsthey
say
that
in
olden
days
there
was
a
passage
under
the
rocky
causeway
that
led
as
far
as
the
old
priory
but
all
traces
of
it
have
been
effaced
then
later
on
sir
adrian
showed
me
in
detail
his
library
i
was
made
to
be
a
man
of
books
he
said
when
i
wondered
at
the
number
he
had
accumulated
around
himthere
must
be
thousands
a
man
of
study
not
of
action
and
you
know
how
fate
has
treated
me
these
have
been
my
one
consolation
of
late
years
and
it
marvelled
me
to
think
that
one
who
had
achieved
so
many
manly
deeds
should
love
musty
old
tiresome
things
so
much
he
really
turned
them
over
quite
reverentially
i
myself
do
not
think
much
of
books
as
companions
when
i
made
that
little
confession
he
smiled
rather
sadly
and
said
that
one
like
me
never
would
lack
the
suitable
companions
of
youth
and
happiness
but
that
a
creature
of
his
unfortunate
disposition
could
find
in
these
long
rows
of
folded
leaves
the
society
of
the
best
and
the
loftiest
minds
not
of
our
age
but
of
all
ages
and
what
was
more
could
find
them
ready
for
intercourse
and
at
their
best
humour
just
in
those
hours
when
he
himself
was
fit
and
disposed
for
such
intercourseand
this
without
dread
of
inflicting
his
own
misery
and
dulness
upon
them
but
i
could
not
agree
with
his
appreciation
i
felt
my
nose
curl
with
disdain
at
the
breath
of
dust
and
must
and
age
these
old
tomes
gave
forth
and
i
said
again
it
was
to
my
mind
but
a
poor
and
tame
sort
of
fellowship
he
was
perched
on
his
ladder
and
had
some
odd
volume
in
his
hand
from
which
he
was
about
to
give
an
example
in
point
on
hearing
however
this
uncongenial
sentiment
he
pushed
back
the
book
and
came
down
quickly
enough
to
talk
to
me
and
this
was
the
last
of
our
excursions
among
the
bookshelves
of
this
i
was
glad
for
i
confess
it
was
there
i
liked
sir
adrian
the
least
when
the
end
of
the
short
day
drew
near
it
was
time
to
go
and
attend
to
the
beacon
we
ascended
the
ladderlike
wooden
stairs
leading
to
the
platform
then
i
had
the
reverse
of
that
view
that
for
so
many
days
had
engrossed
my
interest
pulwick
from
scarthey
what
a
long
time
it
seemed
then
since
i
had
left
those
rooms
the
windows
of
which
now
sent
us
back
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
and
i
had
no
desire
to
return
though
return
i
must
on
the
morrow
ren
of
course
had
left
everything
in
his
usual
trim
order
so
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
see
to
the
lamp
it
pleased
my
fantasy
to
light
the
beacon
of
scarthey
myself
and
i
struck
the
steel
and
kindled
the
brimstone
and
set
fire
to
the
huge
illsmelling
wicks
until
they
gave
a
flame
as
big
as
my
hand
and
there
is
the
light
of
scarthey
at
close
quarters
i
thought
and
the
lightkeeper
was
bending
over
me
with
his
kindly
look
humouring
me
like
a
child
as
we
sat
there
silently
for
a
while
in
the
twilight
there
came
from
the
little
room
adjoining
the
turret
an
odd
sound
of
flapping
and
uncanny
melancholy
cries
sir
adrian
rose
and
we
remembered
the
seagull
by
which
he
had
played
the
part
of
good
samaritan
it
had
happened
on
the
second
day
as
the
storm
was
at
its
height
there
had
come
a
great
crash
at
the
window
and
we
saw
something
white
that
struggled
on
the
sill
outside
sir
adrian
opened
the
casement
when
we
had
a
little
tornado
of
our
own
inside
and
all
his
papers
began
dancing
a
sarabande
in
the
room
and
we
gathered
in
the
poor
creature
that
was
hurt
and
battered
and
more
than
half
stunned
opening
alternately
its
yellow
bill
and
its
red
eyes
in
the
most
absurd
manner
with
a
solicitude
that
it
amused
me
to
watch
sir
adrian
had
tended
the
helpless
gooselike
thing
and
then
handed
it
to
rens
further
care
ren
it
seemed
had
thought
of
trying
to
tame
the
wild
bird
and
had
constructed
a
huge
sort
of
cage
with
laths
and
barrelhoops
and
installed
it
there
with
various
nasty
seafishy
weedy
things
such
as
seagulls
consider
dainty
but
the
prisoner
now
its
vigour
had
returned
yearned
for
nothing
but
the
free
air
and
ever
and
anon
almost
broke
its
wings
in
sudden
frenzy
to
escape
i
wonder
at
ren
said
sir
adrian
contemplating
the
animal
with
his
grave
look
of
commiseration
ren
who
like
myself
has
been
a
prisoner
he
will
be
disappointed
but
we
shall
make
one
of
gods
creatures
happy
this
day
there
is
not
overmuch
happiness
in
this
world
and
regardless
of
the
vicious
pecks
aimed
at
his
hands
he
with
firmness
folded
the
great
strong
wings
and
legs
and
carried
the
gull
outside
on
the
parapet
there
the
bird
sat
a
moment
astonished
turning
its
head
round
at
its
benefactor
before
taking
wing
and
then
it
rose
flying
away
in
great
swoopsflap
flapacross
the
waves
till
we
could
see
it
no
longer
ugly
and
awkward
as
the
creature
looked
in
its
cage
it
was
beautiful
in
its
joyful
steady
flight
and
i
was
glad
to
see
it
go
i
must
have
been
a
bird
myself
in
another
existence
for
i
have
often
that
longing
to
fly
upon
me
and
it
makes
my
heart
swell
with
a
great
impatience
that
i
cannot
but
i
could
not
help
remarking
to
sir
adrian
that
the
birds
last
look
round
had
been
full
of
anger
rather
than
gratitude
and
his
answer
as
he
watched
it
sweep
heavily
away
was
too
gloomy
to
please
me
gratitude
said
he
is
as
rare
as
unselfishness
if
it
were
not
so
this
world
would
be
different
indeed
as
it
is
we
have
no
more
right
to
expect
the
one
than
the
other
and
when
all
is
said
and
done
if
doing
a
socalled
kind
action
gives
us
pleasure
it
is
only
a
special
form
of
selfindulgence
there
is
something
wrong
about
a
reasoning
of
this
kind
but
i
could
not
exactly
point
out
where
we
both
stood
gazing
out
from
our
platform
upon
the
darkening
waters
then
across
our
vision
there
crept
round
the
promontory
a
beautiful
ship
with
all
sails
set
looking
like
some
gigantic
white
bird
sailing
sailing
so
swiftly
yet
so
surely
by
through
the
dim
light
and
i
cried
out
in
admiration
for
there
is
something
in
the
sight
of
a
ship
silently
gliding
that
always
sets
my
heart
beating
but
sir
adrians
face
grew
stern
and
he
said
a
ship
is
a
whitened
sepulchre
but
for
all
that
he
looked
at
it
long
and
pensively
now
it
had
struck
me
before
this
that
sir
adrian
with
all
his
kindness
of
heart
takes
but
a
dismal
view
of
human
nature
and
human
destiny
that
to
him
what
spoils
the
face
of
this
world
is
that
strife
of
lifewhich
to
me
is
as
the
breath
of
my
nostrils
the
absence
of
which
made
my
convent
days
so
grey
and
hateful
to
look
back
upon
i
did
not
like
to
feel
out
of
harmony
with
him
and
so
almost
angrily
i
reproached
him
would
you
have
every
one
live
like
a
limpet
on
a
rock
cried
i
great
heavens
i
would
rather
be
dead
than
not
be
up
and
doing
he
looked
at
me
gravely
pityingly
may
you
never
see
what
i
have
seen
said
he
may
you
never
learn
what
men
have
made
of
the
world
god
keep
your
fair
life
from
such
ways
as
mine
has
been
made
to
follow
the
words
filled
me
i
dont
know
why
with
sudden
misgiving
is
this
life
i
am
so
eager
for
but
horror
and
misery
after
all
would
it
be
better
to
leave
the
book
unopened
they
said
so
at
the
convent
but
what
can
they
know
of
life
at
a
convent
he
bent
his
kind
face
towards
mine
in
the
thickening
gloom
as
though
to
read
my
thoughts
and
his
lips
moved
but
he
did
not
speak
aloud
then
above
the
song
of
the
waves
as
they
gathered
rolled
in
and
fell
upon
the
shingle
all
around
there
came
the
beat
of
oars
hark
said
sir
adrian
our
good
ren
his
tone
was
cheerful
again
and
as
he
hurried
me
away
down
the
stairs
i
knew
he
was
glad
to
divert
me
from
the
melancholy
into
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
drift
and
then
good
ren
came
bringing
breezy
life
and
cheerfulness
with
him
and
a
bundle
and
a
letter
for
me
poor
madeleine
it
seems
she
has
been
quite
ill
with
weeping
for
molly
and
indeed
her
dear
scrawl
was
so
illegible
that
i
could
hardly
read
it
ren
says
she
was
nearly
as
much
upset
by
the
joy
as
by
the
grief
mr
landale
was
not
at
home
he
had
ridden
to
meet
tanty
at
liverpool
for
the
dear
old
lady
has
been
summoned
back
in
hot
haste
with
the
news
of
my
decease
he
for
one
i
thought
to
myself
will
survive
the
shock
of
relief
at
learning
that
molly
has
risen
from
the
dead





ting
ting
ting
there
goes
my
little
clock
fussily
counting
the
hour
to
tell
me
that
i
have
written
so
long
a
time
that
i
ought
to
be
tired
and
so
i
am
though
i
have
not
told
you
half
of
all
i
meant
to
tell
chapter
xvi
the
recluse
and
the
squire
i
thought
i
should
never
get
away
from
supper
and
be
alone
ruperts
air
of
cool
triumphit
was
triumph
however
he
may
have
wished
to
hide
itand
tantys
flow
of
indignation
recrimination
speculation
and
amazement
were
enough
to
drive
me
mad
but
i
held
out
i
pretended
i
did
not
mind
my
cheeks
were
blazing
and
i
talked

tort
et

travers
i
should
have
died
rather
than
that
rupert
should
have
guessed
at
the
tempest
in
my
heart
now
i
am
alone
at
last
thank
god
and
it
will
be
a
relief
to
confide
to
my
faithful
diary
the
feelings
that
have
been
choking
me
these
last
two
hours
pride
must
have
a
fall
thus
rupert
at
supper
with
reference
it
is
true
to
some
trivial
incident
but
looking
at
me
hard
and
full
and
pointing
the
words
with
his
meaning
smile
the
fairies
who
attended
at
my
birth
endowed
me
with
one
power
which
however
doubtful
a
blessing
it
may
prove
in
the
long
run
has
nevertheless
been
an
unspeakable
comfort
to
me
hitherto
this
is
the
reverse
of
what
i
heard
a
french
gentleman
term
lesprit
de
lescalier
thanks
to
this
fairy
godmother
of
mine
the
instant
some
one
annoys
or
angers
me
there
rises
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
the
most
galling
rejoinder
that
can
possibly
be
made
in
the
circumstances
and
i
need
not
add
i
make
it
tonight
when
rupert
flung
his
scoff
at
me
i
was
ready
for
him
i
trust
the
old
adage
has
not
been
brought
home
to
you
sir
rupert
said
i
and
then
pretending
confusion
i
beg
your
pardon
i
added
i
have
been
so
accustomed
to
address
the
head
of
the
house
these
last
days
that
the
word
escaped
me
unawares
the
shot
told
well
and
i
was
gladglad
of
the
murderous
rage
in
ruperts
eyes
for
i
knew
i
had
hit
him
on
the
raw
even
tanty
looked
perturbed
but
rupert
let
me
alone
for
the
rest
of
supper
he
is
right
nevertheless
that
is
what
stung
me
i
am
humbled
and
i
cannot
bear
it
sir
adrian
has
left
i
was
so
triumphant
to
bring
him
back
to
pulwick
this
morning
to
have
circumvented
ruperts
plans
and
let
me
speak
the
truth
so
happy
to
have
him
with
me
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
my
exultation
and
now
he
has
gone
gone
without
a
word
to
me
only
this
miserable
letter
of
determined
farewell
i
will
copy
itfor
in
my
first
anger
i
have
so
crumpled
the
paper
that
it
is
scarcely
readable
my
child
i
must
go
back
to
my
island
the
world
is
not
for
me
nor
am
i
for
the
world
nor
would
i
cast
the
shadow
of
my
gloomy
life
further
upon
your
bright
one
let
me
tell
you
however
that
you
have
left
me
the
better
for
your
coming
that
it
will
be
a
good
thought
to
me
in
my
loneliness
to
know
of
your
mothers
daughters
so
close
to
me
when
you
look
across
at
the
beacon
of
scarthey
child
through
the
darkness
think
that
though
i
may
not
see
you
again
i
shall
ever
follow
and
keep
guard
upon
your
life
and
upon
your
sisters
and
that
even
when
you
are
far
from
pulwick
the
light
will
burn
and
the
heart
of
adrian
landale
watch
so
long
as
it
may
beat
i
have
shed
more
tearshot
tears
of
angersince
i
received
this
than
i
have
wept
in
all
my
life
before
madeleine
came
in
to
me
just
now
too
full
of
the
happiness
of
having
me
back
poor
darling
to
be
able
to
bear
me
out
of
sight
again
but
i
have
driven
her
from
me
with
such
cross
words
that
she
too
is
in
tears
i
must
be
alone
and
i
must
collect
myself
and
my
thoughts
for
i
want
to
state
exactly
all
that
has
happened
and
then
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
see
my
way
more
clearly





this
morning
then
early
after
breakfast
i
started
across
the
waters
between
ren
and
sir
adrian
regretting
to
leave
the
dear
hospitable
island
yet
with
my
heart
dancing
within
me
as
gaily
as
did
our
little
boat
upon
the
chopping
waves
to
be
carrying
the
hermit
back
with
me
i
had
been
deadly
afraid
lest
he
should
at
the
last
moment
have
sent
me
alone
with
the
servant
but
when
he
put
on
his
big
cloak
when
i
saw
ren
place
a
bag
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
knew
he
meant
to
comeperhaps
remain
some
days
at
pulwick
and
my
spirits
went
up
up
it
was
a
lovely
day
too
the
air
had
a
crisp
cold
sparkle
and
the
waters
looked
so
blue
under
the
clear
frosty
sky
i
could
have
sung
as
we
rowed
along
and
every
time
i
met
sir
adrians
eye
i
smiled
at
him
out
of
the
happiness
of
my
heart
his
look
hung
on
mewe
french
have
a
word
for
that
which
is
not
translatable
il
me
couvait
des
yeuxand
as
every
day
of
the
three
we
had
spent
together
i
had
thought
him
younger
and
handsomer
so
this
morning
out
in
the
bright
sunlight
i
said
to
myself
i
could
never
wish
to
see
a
more
noble
man
when
we
landedand
it
was
but
a
little
way
for
the
tide
was
lowthere
was
the
carriage
waiting
and
ren
all
grins
handed
over
our
parcels
to
the
footman
then
we
got
in
the
wheels
began
slowly
dragging
across
the
sand
to
the
road
the
poor
horses
pulling
and
straining
for
it
was
heavy
work
and
ren
stood
watching
us
by
his
boat
his
hand
over
his
eyes
a
black
figure
against
the
dazzling
sunshine
on
the
bay
but
i
could
see
his
white
teeth
gleam
in
that
broad
smile
of
his
from
out
of
his
shadowy
face
as
at
length
we
reached
the
high
road
and
bowled
swiftly
along
i
would
not
let
sir
adrian
have
peace
to
think
for
something
at
my
heart
told
me
he
hated
the
going
back
to
pulwick
and
i
so
chattered
and
fixed
his
attention
that
as
the
carriage
drew
up
he
was
actually
laughing
when
we
stopped
another
carriage
in
front
moved
off
and
there
on
the
porch
stoodrupert
and
tanty
poor
tanty
her
old
face
all
disfigured
with
tears
and
a
great
black
bonnet
and
veil
towering
on
her
head
i
popped
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
called
to
them
when
they
caught
sight
of
me
both
seemed
to
grow
rigid
with
amazement
and
then
across
ruperts
face
came
such
a
look
of
fury
and
such
a
deathly
pallor
i
had
thought
certainly
he
would
not
weep
the
eyes
out
of
his
head
for
me
but
that
he
should
be
stricken
with
anger
to
see
me
alive
i
had
hardly
expected
and
for
the
instant
it
frightened
me
but
then
i
had
no
time
to
observe
anything
else
for
tanty
collapsed
upon
the
steps
and
went
off
into
as
fine
a
fit
of
hysterics
as
i
have
ever
seen
but
fortunately
it
did
not
last
long
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
her
screams
and
rockings
to
and
fro
she
perceived
sir
adrian
as
he
leant
anxiously
over
her
with
the
utmost
energy
she
clutched
his
arm
and
scrambled
to
her
feet
is
it
you
me
poor
child
she
cried
is
it
you
and
then
she
turned
from
him
as
he
stood
with
his
gentle
earnest
face
looking
down
upon
her
and
gave
rupert
a
glare
that
might
have
slain
him
i
knew
at
once
what
she
was
thinking
i
had
experienced
myself
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
sir
adrian
and
connect
his
dignified
presence
for
one
second
with
the
scandalous
impression
rupert
would
have
conveyed
as
for
rupert
he
looked
for
the
first
time
since
i
knew
him
thoroughly
unnerved
then
tanty
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
shook
me
how
dare
you
miss
how
dare
you
she
cried
her
face
was
flaming
how
dare
i
what
asked
i
as
i
hugged
her
how
dare
you
be
walking
about
when
it
is
dead
you
are
and
give
us
all
such
a
frighttherethere
you
know
what
i
meanadrian
she
whimpered
give
me
your
arm
my
nephew
and
conduct
me
into
your
house
all
this
has
upset
me
very
much
but
oh
am
i
not
glad
to
see
you
both
my
children
in
they
went
together
and
my
courage
having
risen
again
to
its
usual
height
i
waited
purposely
on
the
porch
to
tease
rupert
a
little
i
had
a
real
pleasure
in
noticing
how
he
trembled
with
agitation
beneath
his
mask
well
are
you
glad
to
see
me
cousin
rupert
said
i
he
took
my
hand
his
fingers
were
damp
and
cold
can
you
ask
my
fair
cousin
he
sneered
do
you
not
see
me
overcome
with
joy
am
i
not
indeed
especially
favoured
by
providence
for
is
not
this
the
second
time
that
a
beloved
being
has
been
restored
into
my
arms
like
lazarus
from
the
grave
i
was
indignant
at
the
heartlessness
of
his
cynicism
and
so
the
answer
that
leaped
to
my
lips
was
out
before
i
had
time
to
reflect
upon
its
unladylikeness
ay
said
i
and
each
time
you
have
cried
in
your
soul
like
martha
behold
he
stinketh
my
cousin
laughed
aloud
you
have
a
sharp
tongue
he
said
take
care
you
are
not
cut
with
it
yourself
some
day
just
then
the
footmen
who
had
been
unpacking
tantys
trunks
from
the
first
carriage
laid
a
great
wooden
box
upon
the
porch
and
one
of
them
asked
rupert
which
room
they
should
bring
it
to
rupert
looked
at
it
strangely
and
then
at
me
take
it
where
you
will
he
exclaimed
at
last
there
lies
good
moneyvalue
wastedthough
after
all
one
never
knows
what
is
it
said
i
struck
by
a
sinister
meaning
in
his
accents
mourning
beautiful
mollymourning
for
youcrapegownsweeperswherewith
to
have
dried
your
sisters
tearsbut
not
needed
yet
you
see
he
bared
his
teeth
at
me
over
his
shoulderi
could
not
call
it
a
smileand
then
paused
as
he
was
about
to
brush
past
into
the
hall
to
give
me
the
pas
with
a
mocking
bow
he
does
not
even
attempt
now
to
hide
his
dislike
of
me
nor
to
draw
for
me
that
cloak
of
suave
composure
over
the
fierce
temper
that
is
always
gnawing
at
his
vitals
as
surely
as
fox
ever
gnawed
little
spartan
he
sees
that
it
is
useless
i
suppose
as
i
went
upstairs
to
greet
madeleine
i
laughed
to
myself
to
think
how
fate
had
circumvented
the
plotter
alas
how
foolish
i
was
to
laugh
rupert
is
a
dangerous
enemy
and
i
have
made
him
mine
and
in
a
few
hours
he
has
shuffled
the
cards
and
now
he
holds
the
trumps
again
for
that
there
is
du
rupert
in
this
sudden
departure
of
my
knight
i
am
convinced
of
course
his
reasons
are
plain
to
see
it
is
the
vulgarest
ambition
that
prompts
him
to
oust
his
brother
for
as
long
as
possiblefor
ever
if
he
can
and
now
i
am
outwitted
je
rage
i
have
never
been
so
unhappy
my
heart
feels
all
crushed
i
see
no
help
anywhere
i
cannot
in
common
decency
go
and
seek
sir
adrian
upon
his
island
again
and
so
i
sit
and
cry





immediately
upon
his
arrival
tanty
was
closeted
with
sir
adrian
in
the
chamber
allotted
to
her
for
so
long
a
space
of
time
that
rupert
watching
below
in
an
inward
fever
now
flung
back
in
his
chair
biting
his
nails
now
restlessly
pacing
the
room
from
end
to
end
his
mind
working
on
the
new
problem
his
ears
strained
to
catch
the
least
sound
the
while
was
fain
at
last
to
ring
and
give
orders
for
the
immediate
sounding
of
the
dinner
bell
a
good
hour
before
that
meal
might
be
expected
as
the
only
chance
of
interrupting
a
conference
which
boded
so
ill
to
his
plans
meanwhile
madeleine
sobbed
out
the
story
of
her
grief
and
joy
on
mollys
heart
and
miss
sophia
who
thus
inconsiderately
arrested
in
the
full
congenial
flow
of
a
new
grief
was
thrown
back
upon
her
old
sorrows
for
consolation
had
felt
impelled
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
rectors
grave
with
the
wateringcan
and
an
extra
pockethandkerchief
never
perhaps
since
that
worthy
clergyman
had
gasped
out
his
last
struggling
breath
upon
her
bosom
had
she
known
more
unmixed
satisfaction
than
during
those
days
when
she
hovered
round
poor
prostrate
madeleines
bed
and
poured
into
her
deaf
ear
the
tale
of
her
own
woes
and
the
assurances
of
her
thoroughly
understanding
sympathy
she
had
been
looking
forward
with
a
chastened
eagerness
to
the
arrival
of
the
mourning
and
had
already
derived
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
from
the
donning
of
certain
aged
weeds
treasured
in
her
wardrobe
it
was
therefore
a
distinct
though
quite
unconscious
disappointment
when
the
news
came
which
put
an
untimely
end
to
all
these
funereal
revels
at
the
shrill
clamour
of
the
bell
as
rupert
anticipated
adrian
emerged
instantly
from
his
aunts
room
and
a
simultaneous
jingle
of
minor
bells
announced
that
the
ladies
attention
was
in
all
haste
being
turned
to
toilet
matters
whatever
had
passed
between
his
good
old
relative
and
his
sensitive
brother
ruperts
quick
appraising
glance
at
the
latters
face
as
he
went
slowly
down
the
corridor
to
his
own
specially
reserved
apartment
was
sufficient
to
confirm
the
watcher
in
his
misgiving
that
matters
were
not
progressing
as
he
might
wish
sir
adrian
seemed
absorbed
it
is
true
in
grave
thought
but
his
countenance
was
neither
distressed
nor
gloomy
with
a
spasm
of
fierce
annoyance
and
a
bitter
curse
on
the
meddling
of
old
females
and
young
rupert
had
to
admit
that
never
had
he
seen
his
brother
look
more
handsome
more
master
of
the
house
and
of
himself
more
sane
a
few
minutes
later
the
guests
of
pulwick
assembled
in
the
library
one
by
one
with
the
exception
of
sophia
still
watering
the
last
restingplace
of
the
rev
herbert
lee
adrian
came
first
closely
followed
by
tanty
who
turned
a
marked
shoulder
upon
her
younger
nephew
and
devoted
all
her
attention
to
the
elderin
which
strained
condition
of
affairs
the
conversation
between
the
three
was
not
likely
to
be
lively
next
the
sisters
attired
alike
in
white
entered
together
bringing
a
bright
vision
of
youth
and
loveliness
into
the
old
room
at
sight
of
them
adrian
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
sudden
sharp
ejaculation
upon
which
the
two
girls
halted
on
the
threshold
half
shy
half
smiling
for
the
moment
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
they
were
surprisingly
like
each
other
the
difference
of
colouring
being
lost
in
their
curious
similarity
of
contour
my
god
were
there
then
two
cciles
beautiful
miraculous
consoling
had
been
to
the
mourner
in
his
loneliness
the
apparition
of
his
dead
love
restored
to
life
every
time
his
eyes
had
fallen
upon
molly
during
these
last
few
blessed
days
but
this
new
development
was
only
like
a
troublous
mocking
dream
tanty
turned
in
startled
amazement
she
could
feel
the
shudder
that
shook
his
frame
through
the
hand
with
which
he
still
unconsciously
grasped
at
the
back
of
her
chair
an
irrepressible
smile
crept
to
ruperts
lips
the
little
interlude
could
not
have
lasted
more
than
a
few
seconds
when
molly
recovering
her
usual
selfpossession
came
boldly
forward
leading
her
sister
by
the
tips
of
her
fingers
cousin
adrian
she
said
my
sister
madeleine
has
many
things
to
say
to
you
in
thanks
for
your
care
of
my
valuable
person
but
just
now
she
is
too
bashful
to
be
able
to
utter
one
quarter
of
them
as
the
girls
emerged
into
the
room
and
the
light
from
the
great
windows
struck
upon
madeleines
fair
curls
and
the
delicate
pallor
of
her
cheek
as
she
extended
her
hand
and
raised
to
adrians
face
while
she
dropped
her
pretty
curtsey
the
gaze
of
two
unconsciously
plaintive
blue
eyes
the
man
dashed
the
sweat
from
his
brow
with
a
gesture
of
relief
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
the
dark
beauty
of
the
ghost
of
his
dreams
or
its
dashing
presentment
now
smiling
confidently
upon
him
from
tantys
side
he
took
the
little
hand
with
tender
pressure
cciles
daughter
must
be
precious
to
him
in
any
case
madeleine
moreover
had
a
certain
appealing
grace
that
was
apt
to
steal
the
favour
that
molly
won
by
storm
but
indeed
i
could
never
tell
sir
adrian
how
grateful
i
am
said
she
with
a
timidity
that
became
her
as
thoroughly
as
mollys
fearlessness
suited
her
own
stronger
personality
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
again
the
distressful
nightmarelike
feeling
seized
sir
adrians
soul
of
all
characteristics
that
as
the
phrase
is
go
in
families
voices
are
generally
the
most
peculiarly
generic
when
molly
first
addressed
sir
adrian
it
had
been
to
him
as
a
voice
from
the
grave
now
madeleines
gentle
speech
tripped
forth
upon
that
selfsame
notecciles
own
voice
and
next
molly
caught
up
the
sound
and
then
madeleine
answered
again
what
they
said
he
could
not
tell
these
ghoststhese
speaking
ghostsbrought
back
the
old
memories
too
painfully
it
was
thus
ccile
had
spoken
in
the
first
arrogance
of
her
dainty
youth
and
loveliness
and
in
those
softer
tones
when
sorrow
and
work
and
failure
had
subdued
her
proud
spirit
and
now
she
laughs
and
hark
the
laugh
is
echoed
sir
adrian
turns
as
if
to
seek
some
escape
from
this
strange
form
of
torture
meets
ruperts
eye
and
instinctively
braces
himself
into
selfcontrol
come
come
cried
miss
odonoghue
in
her
comfortable
commonplace
cheerful
tone
this
dinner
bell
of
yours
adrian
has
raised
false
hopes
which
seem
to
tarry
in
their
fulfilment
what
are
we
waiting
for
may
i
ask
adrian
looked
at
his
brother
rupert
you
know
my
dear
aunt
he
said
has
the
ordering
of
these
matters
sophia
is
yet
absent
quoth
rupert
drily
but
we
can
proceed
without
her
if
my
aunt
wishes
pooh
yes
sophia
snorted
miss
odonoghue
grasping
sir
adrians
arm
to
show
herself
quite
ready
for
the
march
sophia
we
all
know
what
she
is
why
my
dear
adrian
shell
never
hear
the
bell
till
it
has
stopped
this
half
hour
dinner
cried
rupert
sharply
to
the
butler
whom
his
pull
of
the
bellrope
had
summoned
and
dinner
being
served
the
guests
trooped
into
that
diningroom
which
was
full
of
such
associations
to
sir
adrian
it
was
a
little
thing
but
nevertheless
intensely
galling
to
rupert
to
have
to
play
second
gentleman
and
give
up
his
privileges
as
host
to
his
brother
usually
indeed
adrian
cared
too
little
to
stand
upon
his
rights
and
insisted
upon
ruperts
continuing
to
act
in
his
presence
as
he
did
in
his
absence
but
this
afternoon
tanty
had
left
him
no
choice
nevertheless
as
mr
landale
sat
down
between
the
sisters
and
turned
smiling
to
address
first
one
and
then
the
other
it
would
have
taken
a
very
practised
eye
to
discern
under
the
extra
urbanity
of
his
demeanour
the
intensity
of
his
inward
mortification
he
talked
a
great
deal
and
exerted
himself
to
make
the
sisters
talk
likewise
bantering
molly
into
scornful
and
eager
retorts
and
preventing
madeleine
from
relapsing
into
that
state
of
dreaminess
out
of
which
the
rapid
succession
of
her
recent
sorrow
and
joy
had
somewhat
shaken
her
the
girls
were
both
excited
both
ready
to
laugh
and
jest
tanty
satisfied
to
see
adrian
preside
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
a
grave
courteous
and
selfcontained
manner
that
completely
fulfilled
her
notions
of
what
family
dignity
required
of
him
cracked
her
jokes
ate
her
dinner
and
quaffed
her
cup
with
full
enjoyment
laughing
indulgently
at
her
grandnieces
sallies
and
showing
as
marked
a
disfavour
to
rupert
as
she
deemed
consistent
with
good
manners
the
poor
old
lady
little
guessed
how
the
workings
in
each
brothers
mind
were
all
the
while
silently
but
inevitably
tending
towards
the
destruction
of
her
newly
awakened
hopes





there
was
silence
between
sir
adrian
and
rupert
when
at
last
they
were
left
alone
together
the
elders
gaze
wandering
in
space
his
absent
hand
softly
beating
the
table
his
relaxed
frameall
showed
that
his
mind
was
far
away
from
thought
of
the
youngers
presence
the
relief
to
be
delivered
from
the
twin
echoes
of
a
haunting
voiceonce
the
dearest
on
earth
to
himwas
immense
but
his
whole
being
was
still
quivering
under
the
first
acuteness
of
so
disturbing
an
impression
his
years
of
solitude
moreover
had
ill
prepared
him
for
social
intercourse
the
laughter
the
clash
of
conversation
the
noise
on
every
side
the
length
of
the
meal
the
strain
to
maintain
a
fit
and
proper
attitude
as
host
had
tried
to
the
utmost
nerves
by
nature
hypersensitive
rupert
who
had
leisure
to
study
the
suddenly
lined
and
tired
lineaments
of
the
abstracted
countenance
before
him
noted
with
selfcongratulation
the
change
that
a
few
hours
seemed
to
have
wrought
upon
it
and
decided
that
the
moment
had
come
to
strike
so
adrian
he
said
looking
down
demurely
as
he
spoke
into
the
glass
of
wine
he
had
been
toying
withrupert
was
an
abstemious
man
so
adrian
you
have
been
playing
the
chivalrous
rle
of
rescuer
of
distressed
damselssquire
of
dames
and
what
not
the
last
one
would
have
ascribed
to
you
at
least
at
this
end
of
your
life
ha
throwing
up
his
head
with
a
mirthless
laugh
how
little
any
of
us
would
have
thought
what
a
blessing
in
disguise
your
freak
of
selfexile
was
destined
to
become
to
us
at
the
sound
of
the
incisive
voice
adrian
had
returned
with
a
slight
shiver
from
distant
musing
to
the
consciousness
of
the
others
presence
and
did
you
not
always
look
upon
my
exile
as
a
blessing
undisguised
rupert
answered
he
fixing
his
brother
with
his
large
grave
gaze
ruperts
eyelids
wavered
a
little
beneath
it
but
his
tone
was
coolly
insolent
as
he
made
reply
if
it
pleases
you
to
make
no
count
of
our
fraternal
affection
for
you
my
dear
fellow
if
by
insisting
upon
our
unnatural
depravity
you
contrive
a
more
decent
excuse
for
your
own
vagaries
you
have
my
full
permission
to
dub
me
cain
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
a
light
sigh
escaped
the
elder
man
and
then
he
resolutely
closed
his
lips
it
was
by
behaviour
such
as
this
by
his
almost
diabolical
ingenuity
in
the
art
of
being
uncongenial
that
rupert
had
so
largely
contributed
to
make
his
own
house
impossible
to
him
but
where
was
the
use
of
either
argument
or
expostulation
with
one
so
incapable
of
even
understanding
the
mainsprings
of
his
actions
moreover
he
above
all
must
not
forget
it
rupert
had
suffered
through
him
in
pride
and
selfesteem
and
yet
despite
sir
adrians
philosophic
mind
despite
his
vast
pessimistic
though
benevolent
tolerance
for
erring
human
nature
his
was
a
very
human
heart
and
it
added
not
a
little
to
the
sadness
of
his
lot
at
every
return
to
pulwick
dating
from
that
first
most
bitter
homecoming
to
feel
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
how
little
welcome
he
was
where
the
ties
of
flesh
and
blood
alone
not
to
speak
of
his
most
ceaseless
yet
delicate
generosity
should
have
ensured
him
a
very
different
reception
again
he
sighed
this
time
more
deeply
and
the
corners
of
ruperts
lips
the
arch
of
his
eyebrows
moved
upwards
in
smiling
interrogation
it
must
have
given
you
a
shock
said
mr
landale
carelessly
to
see
the
resemblance
between
molly
and
poor
ccile
not
of
course
that
i
can
remember
her
but
tanty
says
it
is
something
startling
adrian
assented
briefly
i
daresay
it
seems
quite
painful
to
you
at
first
proceeded
rupert
much
in
the
same
deliberate
manner
as
a
surgeon
may
lay
bare
a
wound
despite
the
knowledge
of
the
suffering
he
is
inflicting
i
noticed
that
you
seemed
upset
during
dinner
but
probably
the
feeling
will
wear
off
probably
madeleine
resembles
her
father
i
am
told
but
then
you
never
saw
the
feu
comte
did
you
well
they
are
both
fine
handsome
girls
full
of
life
and
spirits
it
is
our
revered
relatives
intention
to
leave
them
hereas
perhaps
she
has
told
youfor
two
months
or
so
i
have
begged
her
said
sir
adrian
gravely
to
make
them
understand
that
i
wish
them
to
look
upon
pulwick
as
their
home
very
right
very
proper
cried
the
other
in
fact
i
knew
that
was
what
you
would
wishand
your
wishes
of
course
are
my
law
in
the
matter
by
the
way
i
hope
you
quite
understand
adrian
how
it
happened
that
i
did
not
notify
to
you
the
arrival
of
these
guests
extraordinaryknowing
that
you
have
never
got
over
their
mothers
death
and
all
thatit
was
entirely
from
a
wish
to
spare
you
besides
there
was
your
general
prohibition
about
my
visitors
i
did
not
dare
to
take
the
responsibility
in
fact
and
so
i
told
tanty
i
do
not
wish
to
doubt
the
purity
of
your
motives
though
it
would
have
grieved
me
had
these
visitors
no
ordinary
ones
as
you
yourself
admit
come
and
gone
without
my
knowledge
as
it
fell
out
however
even
without
that
childs
dangerous
expedition
i
should
have
been
informed
in
any
caseren
knew
ren
knew
cried
rupert
surprised
and
damn
ren
to
himself
with
heartfelt
energy
that
the
infernal
little
spy
as
he
deemed
his
brothers
servant
should
have
made
a
visit
to
pulwick
without
his
knowledge
was
unpleasant
news
and
it
touched
him
on
his
tenderest
point
but
now
replenishing
his
halfemptied
glass
to
give
adrian
no
excuse
for
putting
an
end
to
the
conference
before
he
himself
desired
it
he
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
task
he
had
set
himself
without
further
delay
and
what
would
you
wish
me
to
do
adrian
he
asked
with
a
pretty
air
of
deference
in
the
matter
of
entertaining
these
ladies
i
have
thought
of
several
things
likely
to
afford
them
amusement
but
since
you
are
here
you
will
readily
understand
that
i
should
like
your
authorisation
first
i
am
anxious
to
consult
you
when
i
can
he
added
apologetically
so
forgive
my
attacking
you
upon
business
tonight
when
you
seem
really
so
little
fitted
for
itbut
you
know
one
cannot
count
upon
you
from
one
minute
to
another
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
to
issue
invitations
for
a
ball
pulwick
was
noted
for
its
hospitality
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
and
the
gloom
that
has
hung
over
the
old
home
these
last
eight
years
has
been
i
suppose
unavoidable
in
the
circumstancesbut
none
the
less
a
pity
no
fear
but
that
our
fair
cousins
would
enjoy
such
a
festivity
and
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
the
sound
of
our
revels
should
not
reach
as
far
as
your
hermitage
a
slow
colour
had
mounted
to
adrians
cheeks
he
drew
his
brows
together
with
an
air
of
displeasure
rupert
quick
to
read
these
symptoms
hastened
to
pursue
the
attack
before
response
should
be
made
the
idea
does
not
seem
to
please
you
he
cried
as
if
in
hurt
surprise
tis
true
i
have
now
no
legal
right
to
think
of
reviving
the
old
hospitable
traditions
of
the
family
but
you
must
remember
adrian
you
yourself
have
insisted
on
giving
me
a
moral
right
to
act
host
here
in
your
absenceyou
have
over
and
over
again
laid
stress
upon
the
freedom
you
wished
me
to
feel
in
the
matter
hitherto
i
have
not
made
use
of
these
privileges
have
not
cared
to
do
so
beyond
an
occasional
duty
dinner
to
our
nearest
neighbours
a
lonely
widower
like
myself
why
should
i
but
now
with
these
gay
young
things
in
the
houseso
near
to
us
in
bloodi
had
thought
it
so
much
our
duty
to
provide
fitting
entertainment
for
them
that
your
attitude
is
incomprehensible
to
me
come
does
it
not
strike
you
as
savouring
a
little
of
the
unamiable
dog
in
the
fable
i
know
you
hate
company
yourself
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
how
can
these
things
here
affect
you
upon
your
island
as
for
the
budget
it
will
stand
it
i
assure
you
i
speak
hotly
pray
excuse
me
i
own
i
have
looked
forward
to
the
thought
of
seeing
once
more
young
and
happy
faces
around
me
you
mistake
me
said
sir
adrian
with
an
effort
while
you
are
acting
as
my
representative
you
have
as
you
know
all
liberty
to
entertain
what
guests
you
choose
and
as
you
see
fit
it
is
natural
perhaps
that
you
should
now
believe
me
anxious
to
hurry
back
to
the
lighthouse
and
i
should
have
told
you
before
that
it
is
my
intention
this
time
to
remain
longer
than
my
wont
in
which
circumstance
the
arrangements
for
the
entertaining
of
our
relatives
will
devolve
upon
myself
rupert
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
forgive
me
but
the
idea
is
too
ludicrous
what
sort
of
funeral
festivities
do
you
propose
to
provide
to
the
neighbourhood
with
you
and
sophia
presiding
the
living
images
of
mourning
and
desolation
there
my
dear
fellow
i
must
laugh
it
will
be
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
with
a
vengeance
why
even
tonight
in
the
bosom
of
your
family
as
it
were
your
presence
lay
so
like
a
wet
blanket
upon
us
all
that
pon
my
soul
i
nearly
cracked
my
voice
trying
to
keep
those
girls
from
noticing
it
seriously
i
am
delighted
of
course
that
you
should
feel
so
sportive
and
it
is
high
time
indeed
that
the
neighbourhood
should
see
something
of
you
but
i
fear
you
are
reckoning
beyond
your
strength
anyhow
command
me
i
shall
be
anxious
to
help
you
all
i
can
in
this
novel
departure
what
are
your
plans
i
have
laid
no
plans
answered
sir
adrian
coldly
after
a
slight
pause
but
you
do
not
need
me
to
tell
you
rupert
that
to
surround
myself
with
such
gaiety
as
you
suggest
is
impossible
you
mean
to
make
our
poor
little
cousins
lead
as
melancholy
an
existence
as
you
do
yourself
then
cried
rupert
with
an
angry
laugh
matters
were
not
progressing
as
he
could
have
wished
i
fear
this
will
cause
a
good
deal
of
disappointment
not
only
to
them
but
to
our
revered
auntfor
she
is
very
naturally
anxious
to
see
her
charges
married
and
settled
and
she
told
me
that
she
more
or
less
counted
upon
my
aid
in
the
matter
now
as
you
are
here
of
course
i
have
thank
heaven
nothing
more
to
say
one
way
or
another
but
you
will
surely
think
of
asking
a
few
likely
young
fellows
over
to
the
house
occasionally
we
are
not
badly
off
for
eldest
sons
in
the
neighbourhood
molly
who
is
as
arrant
a
little
flirt
they
tell
me
as
she
is
pretty
will
be
grateful
to
you
for
the
attention
on
the
score
of
amusement
at
least
mr
landale
speaking
somewhat
at
random
out
of
his
annoyance
to
have
failed
in
immediately
disgusting
the
hermit
of
the
responsibilities
his
return
home
might
entail
here
succeeded
by
chance
in
producing
the
desired
impression
the
idea
of
mollycciles
doublemarryingworse
still
making
love
coquetting
before
his
eyes
was
intolerable
to
adrian
to
have
to
look
on
and
see
cciles
eyes
lavish
glances
of
love
her
lips
soft
words
and
lingering
smiles
upon
some
country
fool
to
have
himself
to
give
this
duplicate
of
his
loves
sweet
body
to
one
unworthy
perhapsit
stung
him
with
a
pain
as
keen
as
it
was
unreasonable
it
was
terrible
to
be
so
made
that
the
past
was
ever
as
living
as
the
present
but
he
must
face
the
situation
he
must
grapple
with
his
own
weakness
tender
memories
had
lured
him
from
his
retreat
and
made
him
for
a
short
time
almost
believe
that
he
could
live
with
them
happy
a
little
while
in
his
own
home
again
but
now
it
was
these
very
memories
that
were
rising
like
avengers
to
drive
him
hence
of
course
the
child
must
marry
if
there
her
happiness
lay
ay
and
both
cciles
children
must
be
amused
made
joyful
while
they
still
could
enjoy
liferupert
was
rightright
in
all
he
saidbut
he
adrian
could
not
be
there
to
see
that
was
beyond
his
endurance
it
was
impossible
of
course
for
one
so
singleminded
himself
to
follow
altogether
the
doublings
of
such
a
mind
as
ruperts
but
through
the
melancholy
relief
of
this
sudden
resolution
adrian
was
distinctly
conscious
of
the
underlying
duplicity
the
unworthy
motives
which
had
prompted
his
brothers
arguments
he
rose
from
the
table
and
looked
down
with
sad
gaze
at
the
youngers
beautiful
mask
of
a
face
god
knows

said

rupert
i
do
not
so
often
inflict
my
presence
upon
you
that
you
should
be
so
anxious
to
show
me
how
much
better
i
should
do
to
keep
away
i
admit
nevertheless
the
justice
of
all
you
say
it
is
but
right
that
mesdemoiselles
de
savenaye
should
be
surrounded
with
young
and
cheerful
society
and
even
were
i
in
a
state
to
act
as
master
of
the
revels
here
he
smiled
a
little
dreamily
my
very
presence
as
you
say
would
cast
a
gloom
upon
their
merrymakingi
will
go

slowly
he
moved
away
leaving

motionless
in

did

the
gold
smuggler
and
the
philosopher
on
the
evening
of
the
day
which
had
seen
miss
mollys
departure
for
the
main
land
ren
after
the
usual
brisk
postprandial
altercation
with
old
margery
by
her
kitchen
fire
was
cheerfully
finding
his
way
lantern
in
hand
to
his
turret
when
in
the
silence
of
the
night
he
heard
the
door
of
the
keep
open
and
close
and
presently
recognised
sir
adrians
tread
echoing
on
the
flagged
steps
beneath
him
astonished
at
this
premature
return
and
full
of
vague
dismay
he
hurried
down
to
receive
his
master
there
was
a
cloud
on
sir
adrians
face
plainly
discernible
in
spite
of
the
unaltered
composure
of
his
manner
i
did
not
expect
your
honour
back
so
soon
said
ren
tentatively
i
myself
did
not
anticipate
to
return
i
had
thought
i
might
perhaps
stay
some
days
at
pulwick
but
i
find
there
is
no
home
like
this
one
for
me
ren
there
was
a
long
silence
but
when
ren
had
rekindled
a
blaze
upon
the
hearth
and
set
the
lamp
upon
the
table
he
stood
a
moment
before
withdrawing
almost
begging
by
his
look
some
further
crumb
of
information
my
room
is
ready
i
suppose
inquired
sir
adrian
yes
your
honour
quoth
the
man
ruefully
margery
and
i
put
it
back
exactly
asas
before
goodnight
then
goodnight
said
the
master
after
a
pause
warming
his
hands
as
the
flames
began
to
leap
through
the
network
of
twigs
i
shall
go
to
bed
i
am
tired
i
had
to
row
myself
across
you
will
take
the
boat
back
tomorrow
morning
ren
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
caught
the
sound
of
a
sigh
coming
from
the
hearthside
and
shaking
his
head
in
silence
obeyed
the
implied
dismissal
and
bitterly
did
he
meditate
in
his
bunk
that
night
upon
the
swift
crumbling
of
those
aircastles
he
had
built
himself
so
gaily
erstwhile
in
the
rose
and
blue
atmosphere
that
la
demoiselle
had
seemed
to
bring
with
her
to
scarthey





from
the
morrow
the
old
regular
mode
of
life
began
again
in
the
keep
sir
adrian
read
a
good
deal
or
at
least
appeared
so
to
do
but
ren
who
kept
him
more
than
ever
under
his
glances
of
wistful
sympathy
noted
that
far
from
being
absorbed
as
of
old
in
the
pages
of
his
book
the
recluses
eyes
wandered
much
off
its
edges
into
space
that
when
writing
or
at
least
intent
on
writing
his
pen
would
linger
long
in
the
bottle
and
hover
listlessly
over
the
paper
that
he
was
more
abstracted
even
than
his
wont
when
looking
out
of
the
eastern
window
and
that
on
the
platform
of
the
beacon
it
was
the
landward
view
which
most
drew
his
gaze
there
was
also
more
music
in
the
keep
than
was
the
custom
in
evener
days
seated
at
his
organ
the
lightkeeper
seemed
to
find
a
voice
for
such
thoughts
as
were
not
to
be
spoken
or
written
and
relief
for
the
nameless
pity
of
them
but
never
a
word
passed
between
the
two
men
on
the
subject
that
filled
both
their
hearts
it
was
sir
adrians
pleasure
that
things
at
scarthey
should
seem
to
be
exactly
the
same
as
before
and
that
was
enough
for
ren
and
yet
mused
the
faithful
fellow
within
his
disturbed
mind
the
ruins
now
look
like
a
house
the
day
after
an
interment
if
we
were
lonely
before
my
faith
now
we
are
desolate
and
trying
to
find
something
or
somebody
to
charge
with
the
curse
of
it
he
invariably
fell
to
upon
mr
landales
sleek
head
why
he
could
hardly
have
explained
three
new
days
had
thus
passed
in
the
regularity
if
not
the
serenity
of
the
oldthey
seemed
old
already
buried
far
back
in
the
past
those
days
that
had
lapsed
so
evenly
before
the
brightness
of
youthful
and
beautiful
life
had
entered
the
keep
for
one
brief
moment
and
departing
again
left
it
a
ruin
indeedwhen
the
retirement
of
scarthey
was
once
more
invaded
by
an
unexpected
visitor
it
was
about
sundown
of
the
shortest
day
sir
adrian
was
at
his
organ
almost
unconsciously
interpreting
his
own
sadness
into
music
in
time
the
yearning
of
his
soul
had
had
expression
the
echo
of
the
last
sighing
chord
died
away
in
the
tranquil
air
yet
the
musician
with
head
bent
upon
his
breast
remained
lost
in
faraway
thoughts
a
slight
shuffling
noise
disturbed
him
turning
round
to
greet
ren
as
he
supposed
he
was
astonished
to
see
a
mans
figure
lolling
in
his
own
armchair
as
he
peered
inquiringly
into
the
twilight
the
intruder
rose
to
his
feet
and
cried
with
a
voice
loud
and
clear
pleasant
withal
to
the
ear
sir
adrian
i
am
sorry
you
have
stopped
so
soon
i
never
heard
anything
more
beautiful
the
door
was
ajar
and
i
crept
in
like
a
cat
not
to
disturb
you
still
in
doubt
but
with
his
fine
air
of
courtesy
the
lightkeeper
advanced
towards
the
uninvited
guest
am
i
mistaken

said
with
some
hesitation

voice
my
dear
fellow
jack
smith
at
your
service
please
to
remember
answered
the
visitor
with
a
genial
ring
of
laughter
in
his
words
not
that
it
matters
much
here
i
suppose
had
i
not
heard
the
peal
of
your
organ
i
should
have
thought
scarthey
deserted
indeed
i
could
find
no
groom
of
the
chambers
to
announce
me
in
due
form
as
he
spoke
the
two
had
drawn
near
each
other
and
clasped
hands
heartily
now
to
think
of
your
knowing
my
voice
in
this
manner
you
have
a
devilish
knack
of
spotting
your
man
sir
adrian
it
is
almost
four
years
since
i
was
here
last
is
it
not
four
yearsso
it
is
and
four
years
that
have
done
well
by
you
it
would
appear
what
a
picture
of
strength
and
lustiness
it
really
seems
to
regenerate
one
and
put
heart
of
grace
in
one
only
to
take
you
by
the
handwelcome
captain
smith
nothing
could
have
more
succinctly
described
the
outer
man
of
him
who
chose
to
be
known
by
that
most
nondescript
of
patronymics
sir
adrian
stood
for
a
moment
contemplating
with
glances
of
approval
such
as
he
seldom
bestowed
on
his
fellowman
the
symmetrical
slender
yet
vigorous
figure
of
his
friend
and
responding
with
an
unwonted
cheerfulness
to
the
smile
that
lit
up
the
steelblue
eyes
and
parted
the
shapely
strong
and
goodhumoured
mouth
of
the
privateersman
dear
me
and
what
a
buck
we
have
become
continued
the
baronet
what
splendid
plumage
it
is
good
to
see
you
so
prosperous
and
so
this
is
the
latest
fashion
no
doubt
it
sets
forth
the
frame
of
a
goodly
man
though
no
one
could
guess
at
the
sea
dog
beneath
such
a
set
of
garments
i
used
to
consider
my
brother
rupert
the
most
especial
dandy
i
had
ever
seen
but
that
evidently
was
my
limited
experience
even
rupert
cannot
display
so
perfect
a
fit
in
bottlegreen
coats
so
faultless
a
silken
stock
buckskins
of
such
matchless
drab
captain
jack
laughed
blushed
slightly
under
the
friendly
banter
and
allowed
himself
to
be
thrust
back
into
the
seat
he
had
just
vacated
welcome
again
on
my
lonely
estate
i
hope
this
is
not
to
be
a
mere
flying
visit
you
know
my
misanthropy
vanishes
when
i
have
your
company
how
did
you
come
not
by
the
causeway
i
should
say
smiling
again
and
glancing
at
the
unblemished
topboots
i
have
two
men
waiting
for
me
in
the
gig
below
my
schooner
the
peregrine
lies
in
the
offing
the
elder
man
turned
to
the
window
and
through
the
grey
curtain
of
crepuscule
recognised
the
rakish
topsail
schooner
that
had
excited
mollys
admiration
some
days
before
he
gazed
forth
upon
it
a
few
meditative
moments
not
knowing
whether
i
would
find
you
ready
to
receive
me
pursued
the
captain
i
arranged
that
the
peregrine
was
to
wait
for
me
if
i
had
to
return
tonight
which
of
course
is
not
to
be
heard
of
said
sir
adrian
here
is
renny
he
will
carry
word
that
with
me
you
remain
tonight
come
renny
do
you
recognise
an
old
acquaintance
already
well
disposed
towards
any
one
who
could
call
this
note
of
pleasure
into
the
loved
voice
the
breton
who
had
just
entered
turned
to
give
a
broad
stare
at
the
handsome
stranger
then
burst
into
a
guffaw
of
pure
delight
by
my
faith
it
is
mr
the
lieutenant
he
ejaculated
adding
as
ingeniously
as
tanty
herself
might
have
done
that
he
would
never
have
known
him
again
it
is
mr
the
captain
now
renny
said
that
person
and
held
out
a
strong
hand
to
grip
that
of
the
little
frenchman
which
the
latter
after
the
preliminary
rubbing
upon
his
trousers
that
his
code
of
manners
enjoined
readily
extended
ah
it
is
a
good
wind
that
sent
you
here
this
day
said
he
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
when
this
ceremony
had
been
duly
gone
through
you
say
well
acquiesced
his
master
it
has
ever
been
a
good
wind
that
has
brought
captain
jack
across
my
path
and
then
receiving
directions
to
refresh
the
gigs
crew
and
dismiss
them
back
to
their
ship
with
instructions
to
return
for
orders
on
the
morrow
the
servant
hurried
forth
leaving
the
two
friends
once
more
alone
thanks
said
captain
jack
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
the
messenger
that
will
exactly
suit
my
purpose
i
have
a
good
many
things
to
talk
over
with
you
since
you
so
kindly
give
me
the
opportunity
in
the
first
place
let
me
unburden
myself
of
a
debt
which
is
now
of
old
standingand
let
me
say
at
the
same
time
added
the
young
man
rising
to
deposit
upon
the
table
a
lettercase
which
he
had
taken
from
his
breastpocket
that
though
my
actual
debt
is
now
met
my
obligation
to
you
remains
the
same
and
will
always
be
so
you
said
just
now
that
i
looked
prosperous
and
so
i
amowing
somewhat
to
good
luck
it
is
true
but
owing
above
all
to
you
no
luck
would
have
availed
me
much
without
that
to
start
upon
and
he
pointed
to
the
contents
of
the
case
a
thick
bundle
of
notes
which
his
host
was
now
smilingly
turning
over
with
the
tip
of
his
fingers
i
might
have
sent
you
a
draft
but
there
is
no
letterpost
that
i
know
of
to
scarthey
and
besides
it
struck
me
that
just
as
these
four
thousand
pounds
had
privately
passed
between
you
and
me
you
might
prefer
them
to
be
returned
in
the
same
manner
i
prefer
it
since
it
has
brought
you
in
person
said
sir
adrian
thrusting
the
parcel
into
a
drawer
and
pulling
his
chair
closer
towards
his
guest
dealings
with
a
man
like
you
give
one
a
taste
of
an
ideal
world
would
that
more
human
transactions
could
be
carried
out
in
so
simple
and
frank
a
manner
as
this
little
business
of
ours
captain
jack
laughed
outright
upon
my
word
you
are
a
greater
marvel
to
me
every
time
i
see
youwhich
is
not
by
any
means
often
enough
the
other
raised
his
eyebrows
in
interrogation
and
the
sailor
went
on
is
it
really
possible
that
it
is
to
my
mode
of
dealing
that
you
attribute
the
delightful
simplicity
of
a
transaction
involving
a
little
fortune
from
hand
to
hand
and
where
pray
in
this
terraqueous
sublunary
spherei
heard
that
good
phrase
from
a
literary
exquisite
at
bath
and
it
seems
to
me
comprehensivewhere
then
on
this
terraqueous
sublunary
globe
of
ours
sir
adrian
landale
could
one
expect
to
find
another
person
ready
to
lend
a
privateersman
trading
under
an
irresponsible
name
the
sum
of
four
thousand
pounds
without
any
other
security
than
his
volunteered
promise
to
return
itif
possible
sir
adrian
ignoring
the
tribute
to
his
own
merits
arose
and
placed
his
friendly
hand
on
the
speakers
shoulder
and
now
my
dear
jack
he
said
gravely
that
the
war
is
over
you
will
have
to
turn
your
energies
in
another
direction
i
am
glad
you
are
out
of
that
unworthy
trade
captain
jack
bounded
up
no
no
sir
adrian
i
value
your
opinion
too
much
to
allow
such
a
statement
to
pass
unchallenged
unworthy
trade
we
have
not
given
back
those
french
devils
one
half
of
the
harm
they
have
done
to
our
own
merchant
service
it
was
war
you
know
and
you
know
also
or
perhaps
you
dontin
which
case
let
me
tell
youthat
my
cormorant
has
made
her
goodly
name
ay
and
brought
her
commander
a
fair
share
of
his
credit
by
her
energy
in
bringing
to
an
incredible
number
of
those
dd
french
sharksbeg
pardon
but
you
know
the
pestilent
breed
well
we
shall
never
agree
upon
the
subject
i
fear
as
for
me
the
smart
of
the
salt
air
the
sting
of
the
salt
breeze
the
fighting
the
danger
they
have
got
into
my
blood
and
even
now
it
sometimes
comes
over
me
that
life
will
not
be
perfect
life
to
me
without
the
dancing
boards
under
my
feet
and
the
free
waves
around
me
and
my
jolly
boys
to
lead
to
death
or
glory
yet
could
you
but
know
it
this
is
the
veriest
treason
and
i
revoke
the
words
a
thousand
times
you
look
amazed
and
well
you
may
ah
i
have
much
to
tell
you
but
i
take
it
you
will
not
care
to
hear
all
i
have
been
able
to
achieve
on
the
basis
of
your
munificent
help
at
myahem
unworthy
trade
well
no
said
sir
adrian
smiling
i
can
quite
imagine
it
and
imagine
it
without
enthusiasm
though
perhaps
as
you
say
such
things
have
to
be
but
i
should
like
to
know
of
these
present
circumstances
these
prospects
which
make
you
look
so
happy
no
doubt
the
fruits
of
peace
yes
i
suppose
in
one
way
they
may
be
called
so
yet
without
the
war
and
your
helping
hand
they
would
even
now
hang
as
far
from
me
as
the
grapes
from
the
foxwhen
i
arrived
in
england
three
months
after
the
peace
had
been
signed
i
had
accumulated
in
the
books
of
certain
banks
a
tolerably
respectable
account
to
the
credit
of
a
certain
person
whose
name
oddly
enough
you
on
one
or
two
occasions
have
applied
absently
to
captain
jack
smith
i
was
i
will
own
already
feeling
inclined
to
discuss
with
myself
the
propriety
of
assuming
the
name
in
question
when
there
came
something
in
my
way
of
which
i
shall
tell
you
presently
which
something
has
made
me
resolve
to
remain
captain
smith
for
some
time
longer
the
old
cormorant
lay
at
bristol
and
being
too
big
for
this
new
purpose
i
sold
her
it
was
like
cutting
off
a
limb
i
loved
every
plank
of
her
knew
every
frisk
of
her
she
served
me
well
to
the
end
for
she
fetched
her
valuealmost
next
having
time
on
my
hands
i
bethought
myself
of
seeing
again
a
little
of
the
world
and
when
i
tell
you
that
i
drove
over
to
bath
you
may
perhaps
begin
to
see
what
i
am
coming
to
sir
adrian
suddenly
turned
in
his
chair
to
face
his
friend
again
with
a
look
of
singular
attention
well
no
not
exactly
and
yetunless
pshaw
impossible
upon
which
lucid
commentary
he
stopped
gazing
with
anxious
inquiry
into
captain
jacks
smiling
eyes
ah
i
believe
you
have
just
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
with
that
confounded
perspicacity
of
yours
saying
which
the
sailor
laughed
and
blushed
not
unbecomingly
this
is
how
it
came
about
i
had
transactions
with
old
john
harewood
the
banker
in
bristol
transactions
advantageous
to
both
sides
but
perhaps
most
to
himsly
old
dog
at
any
rate
the
old
fellow
took
a
monstrous
fancy
to
me
over
his
claret
and
when
i
mentioned
bath
recommended
me
to
call
upon
his
wife
a
very
fine
dame
who
prefers
the
fashion
of
the
spa
to
the
business
of
bristol
and
consequently
lives
as
much
in
the
former
place
as
good
john
harewood
will
allow
well
you
wonder
at
my
looking
prosperous
and
happy

the
hic

maria
harewoods
i
met
one
who
if
i
mistake
not
is
of
your
kin
already
then
somewhere
at
the
back
of
my
memory
dwelt
the
name
of

bless
me
i
have
surely
said
nothing
to
the
young
man
broke
off
disconcerted
sir
adrians
face
had
become
unwontedly
clouded
but
he
waved
the
speaker
on
impatiently
no
no
i
am
surprised
of
course
only
surprised

adrian
captain
jack
pursued
pacing
enthusiastically
about
i
have
been
no
saint
and
no
doubt
i
have
fancied
myself
as
a
lover
once
or
twice
ere
this
but
to
see
that
girl
sir
means
a
change
in
a
mans
life
to
have
met
the
light
of
those
sweet
eyes

now
the
lovers
face
was
illumined
he
walked
the
room
like
one
treading
on
air
as
the
joy
within
him
found
its
voice
in
words
sir
adrian
listened
with
an
extraordinary
tightness
at
his
heart
he
had
loved
one
woman
even
so
that
love
was
still
with
him
as
the
scent
clings
to
the
phial
but
the
sight
of
this
young
joyful
love
made
him
feel
old
in
that
hourold
as
he
had
never
realised
before
there
was
no
room
in
his
being
for
such
love
again
and
yet
there
was
a
tremulous
anxiety
in
the
question
he
put
after
a
short
pause
there
are
two
demoiselles

which
is

turned
on

heels
and
exclaimed
enthusiastically
to
me
there
is
but
oneone
woman
in
the
worldmadeleine
his
look
met
that
of
sir
adrian
in
full
and
even
in
the
midst
of
his
own
selfcentred
mood
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
transient
gleam
that
shot
in
the
elders
eyes
and
the
sudden
relaxation
of
his
features
he
pondered
for
a
moment
or
two
scanning
the
while
the
countenance
of
the
recluse
then
a
smile
lighted
up
his
own
bronzed
face
in
a
very
sweet
and
winning
way
as
her
kinsman
have
i
your
approval
he
asked
and
proceeded
earnestly
to
tell
the
truth
at
once
i
was
looking
to
even
more
than
your
approvalto
your
support
sir
adrians
mood
had
undergone
a
change
as
a
breeze
sweeping
from
a
new
quarter
clears
in
a
moment
a
darkening
mist
from
the
face
of
the
earth
captain
jacks
answer
had
blown
away
for
the
nonce
the
atmosphere
of
misgiving
that
enveloped
him
he
answered
promptly
and
with
warmth
being
your
friend
i
am
glad
to
know
of
this
being
her
kinsman
i
may
add
my
dear
hubertthere
was
just
a
tinge
of
hesitation
followed
by
a
certain
emphasis
on
the
change
of
namei
promise
to
support
you
in
your
hopes
in
so
far
as
i
have
any
influence
for
power
or
right
over
my
cousin
i
have
none
the
sailor
threw
himself
down
once
more
in
his
armchair
and
tapping
his
shining
hessians
with
the
stem
of
his
long
clay
in
smiling
abstraction
began
with
all
a
lovers
egotism
to
expatiate
on
the
theme
that
filled
his
heart
it
is
a
singular
an
admirable
a
never
sufficientlytobepraised
conjunction
of
affairs
which
has
ultimately
brought
me
near
you
when
i
was
pursuing
the
light
o
my
heart
ruthlessly
snatched
away
by
a
cunning
and
implacable
dragon
known
to
you
as
miss
odonoghue
i
say
dragon
in
courtesy
i
called
her
by
better
names
before
i
realised
what
a
service
she
was
unconsciously
rendering
us
by
this
sudden
removal
known
to
me
laughed
sir
adrian
my
own
mothers
sister
then
i
still
further
retract
moreover
seeing
how
things
have
turned
out
i
must
now
regard
her
as
an
angel
in
disguise
dont
look
so
surprised
has
she
not
brought
my
love
under
your
protection
i
thought
i
was
tolerably
proof
against
the
little
god
but
then
he
had
never
shot
his
arrows
at
me
from
between
the
long
lashes
of
madeleine
de
savenaye
oh
those
eyes
adrian
so
unlike
those
southern
eyes
i
have
known
so
well
too
well
in
other
days
brilliant
hard
challenging
battle
from
the
first
glance
and
yet
from
the
first
promising
that
surrender
which
is
ever
so
speedy
pah
no
more
of
such
memories
before
her
blue
eyes
on
my
first
introduction
i
feltwell
i
felt
as
the
novice
does
under
the
first
broadside
the
speaker
looked
dreamily
into
space
as
if
the
delicious
moment
rose
again
panoramically
before
him
well
he
pursued
that
did
me
no
harm
after
all
lady
maria
harewood
who
i
have
learned
since
deals
strongly
in
sentiment
and

unfortunately
debarred
by
circumstances
from
indulgence
in
the
soothing
luxury

her
own
behalf

her

prosaic

delighted
with
such
a
rarity
as
a
bashful
privateersmanher
tame
corsair
as
i
heard
her
call
your
humble
servanti
was
a
hero
sir
a
perfect
hero
of
romance
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
on
the
strength
of
this
renown
thrust
upon
me
i
found
grace
before
the
most
adorable
blue
eyes
had
words
of
sympathy
from
the
sweetest
lips
and
smiles
from
the
most
bewitching
little
mouth
in
all
the
world
so
you
see
i
owe
poor
lady
maria
a
good
thought
you
laugh
sir
adrian
was
smiling
but
all
in
benevolence
at
the
artlessness
of
this
eager
youth
who
in
all
the
unconscious
glory
of
his
looks
and
strength
ascribed
the
credit
of
his
entrance
into
a
maidens
heart
to
the
virtue
of
a
few
irresponsible
words
of
recommendation
ah
those
were
days
everything
went
on
smoothly
and
i
was
debating
with
myself
whether
i
would
not
at
once
boldly
ask
her
to
be
the
wife
of
hubert
cochrane
though
the
casting
of
jack
smiths
skin
would
have
necessitated
the
giving
up
of
several
of
his
freetrading
engagements
free
trading
you
do
not
mean
to
say
man
alive
that
you

turned

i
cut
a
pretty
figure
evidently
in
your
worships
eyes
lucky
for
me
you
never
would
be

you

to

i
was
about
as
i
have
said
to
give
that
up
for
the
reasons
i
mentioned
when
upon
a
certain
fine
evening
i
crossed
the
path
of
one
of
the
most
masterful
old
maids
i
have
ever
seen
or
even
heard
of

would
you
believe
itthis
with
a
quizzical

grave

misguided
old
lady

such
a
violent
dislike
to
me
at
first
sight
and
expressed
it
so
thoroughly
well
that
hang
me
if
i
was
not
completely
brought
to
and
all
for
escorting
my
dear
one
from
lady
marias
house
to
her
own
well
the
walk
was
worth
itthough
the
old
crocodile
was
on
the
watch
for
us
ready
to
snap
had
got
wind
of
the
secret
somehow
a
secret
unspoken
even
between
us
two
this
first
and
last
interview
took
place
on
the
flags
in
front
of
no
17
camden
place
bath
oh
it
was
a
very
onesided
affair
from
the
beginning
and
ended
abruptly
in
a
door
being
banged
in
my
face
then
i
heard
about
miss
odonoghues
peculiarities
in
the
direction
of
exclusiveness
and
then
also
oddly
enough
for
the
first
time
of
the
great
fortune
going
with
my
madeleines
hand
of
course
i
saw
it
all
and
i
may
say
forgave
the
old
lady
in
short
i
realised
that
in
miss
odonoghues
mind
i
am
nothing
but
an
unprincipled
fortuneseeker
and
adventurer
now
you
adrian
can
vouch
that
whatever
my
faults
i
am
none
such
sir
adrian
threw
a
quiet
glance
at
his
friend
whose
eyes
sparkled
as
they
met
it
god
knows
continued
the
latter
that
all
i
care
for
concerning
the
money
is
that
she
may
have
it
this
last
venture
the
biggest
and
most
difficult
of
all
i
then
decided
to
undertake
that
i
might
be
the
fitter
mate
for
the
heiressbless
her
oh
adrian
man
could
you
have
seen
her
sweet
tearful
face
that
night
you
would
understand
that
i
could
not
rest
upon
such
a
parting
in
the
dawn
of
the
next
morning
i
was
in
the
streetnot
so
much
upon
the
chance
of
meeting
though
i
knew
that
such
sweetness
would
have
now
to
be
all
stolenbut
to
watch
her
door
her
window
a
lovers
trick
rewarded
by
lovers
luck
leaning
on
the
railings
through
the
cold
mist
cold
it
was
though
i
never
felt
it
but
i
mind
me
now
how
the
icicles
broke
under
my
hand
what
should
i
see
before
even
the
churchbells
had
set
to
chiming
or
the
yawning
sluts
to
pull
the
kitchen
curtains
but
a
bloated
monster
of
a
coach
dragging
and
sliding
up
the
street
to
halt
at
her
very
door
then
out
came
the
beldam
herself
and
two
muffledup
slender
thingsmy
madeleine
one
of
course
but
i
had
a
regular
turn
at
sight
of
them
for
i
swear
i
could
not
tell
which
was
which
off
rattled
the
chariot
at
a
smart
pace
and
there
i
stood
friend
feeling
as
if
my
heart
was
tied
behind
with
the
trunks
the
sailor
laughed
ran
his
fingers
through
his
curls
and
stamped
in
lively
recollection
nothing
to
be
drawn
from
their
landlady
but
i
am
not
the
man
to
allow
a
prize
to
be
snatched
from
under
my
very
nose

heat
of

it
was
clearing
for
action
so
to
speaki
ran
out
and
overtook
the
ostler

i
had
seen
putting
the
finishing
touch
to
the
lashing
of
boxes
behind

the

was
worth
the
guinea
it
cost
me
a
hundred
times
overin
less
than
an
hour
i
was
in
the
saddle
ready
for
pursuit
cantering
boot
to
boot
with
my
mana
trusty
fellow
who
knows
how
to
hold
his
tongue
and
can
sit
a
horse
in
the
bargain
neither
at
gloucester
nor
the
next
day
up
to
worcester
could
we
succeed
in
doing
more
than
keep
our
fugitives
in
view
when
they
had
alighted
at
one
inn
as
ascertained
by
my
squire
we
patronised
the
opposition
hostelry
and
the
ensuing
morning
cantered
steadily
in
pursuit
on
our
new
posthorses
half
an
hour
after
they
had
rumbled
away
with
their
relays
but
the
evening
of
our
arrival
at
worcester
my
fellow
found
out
at
last
what
the
next
stage
was
to
be
andclever
chap
he
lost
nothing
for
his
sharpnessthat
the
three
kings
heads
had
been
recommended
to
the
old
lady
as
the
best
house
in
shrewsbury
this
time
we
took
the
lead
and
on
to
shrewsbury
and
were
at
the
glorious
old
kings
heads
i
in
a
private
room
tight
as
wax
a
good
couple
of
hours
before
the
chariot
made
its
appearance
and
there
man
there
my
pretty
one
and
i
met
again
that
was
no
doubt
put
in
sir
adrian
in
his
gentle
indulgent
way
what
made
the
kings
heads
so
glorious
ay
right
and
yet
it
was
but
a
few
seconds
on
the
stair
under
a
smoky
lamp
but
her
beauty
filled
the
landing
with
radiance
as
her
kindness
did
my
soulit
was
but
for
a
moment
all
blessed
moment
too
brief
alas
ah
adrian
friendold
hermit
in
your
cellyou
have
never
known
life
you
who
have
never
tasted
a
moment
such
as
that
then
we
started
apart
there
was
a
noise
below
and
she
had
only
time
to
whisper
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
pulwick
to
some
relativeshad
only
heard
it
that
very
daywhen
steps
came
up
the
stairs
creaking
with
a
last
promise
a
last
word
of
love
i
leaped
back
into
my
own
chamber
there
to
see
through
the
chink
between
door
and
post
the
untimely
old
mischiefmaker
herself
pass
slowly
sour
and
solemn
towards
her
apartments
leaning
upon
her
other
nieces
arm
how
could
i
have
thought
that
baggage
like
my
princess
handsome
if
you
will
but
with
her
saucy
eye
her
raven
head
her
brown
cheek
no
more
to
be
compared
to
my
stately
lily
than
brass
to
gold
the
host
listening
wonderingly
his
eyes
fixed
with
kindly
gravity
upon
the
speaker
as
he
rattled
on
here
gave
a
slight
start
all
unnoticed
of
his
friend
the
next
morning
when
i
had
seen
the
coach
and
its
precious
freight
move
on
once
more
northward
i
began
the
retreat
south
hugging
myself
upon
luck
and
success
i
had
business
in
salcombeperhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
the
salcombe
schoonersin
connection
with
the
fitting
out
of
that
sailing
wonder
the
peregrine
and
so
concluded
captain
jack
laughing
again
in
exuberance
of
joy
you
may
possibly
guess
one
of
the
reasons
that
has
brought
her
and
me
round
by
your
island
there
ensued
a
long
silence
filled
with
thoughts
equally
pressing
though
of
widely
different
complexion
on
either
side
of
the
hearth





during
the
meal
which
was
presently
set
forth
and
proclaimed
ready
by
ren
the
talk
as
was
natural
in
that
watchful
attendants
presence
ran
only
on
general
topics
and
was
in
consequence
fitful
and
unspontaneous
but
when
the
two
men
for
all
their
difference
of
age
temper
and
pursuits
so
strongly
yet
so
oddly
united
in
sympathy
were
once
more
alone
they
naturally
fell
back
under
the
influence
of
the
more
engrossing
strain
of
reflection
again
there
was
silence
while
each
mused
gazing
into
space
and
vaguely
listening
to
the
plash
of
high
water
under
the
window
it
must
have
been
a
strong
motive
said
sir
adrian
after
his
dreamy
fashion
like
one
thinking
aloud
to
induce
a
man
like
you
to
abandon
his
honourable
name
captain
jack
flushed
at
these
words
drew
his
elbows
from
the
table
and
shot
a
keen
inquiring
glance
at
his
friend
which
however
fell
promptly
before
the
latters
unconscious
gaze
and
was
succeeded
by
one
of
reflective
melancholy
then
with
a
slight
sigh
he
raised
his
glass
to
the
lamp
and
while
peering
abstractedly
through
the
ruby
the
story
of
turning
my
back
upon
my
house
he
said
musingly
shaking
its
very
dust
off
my
feet
so
to
speak
and
starting
life
afresh
unbeholden
to
my
father
even
for
what
he
could
not
take
away
from
memy
own
nameis
a
simple
affair
although
pitiful
enough
perhaps
but
memories
of
family
wrongs
and
family
quarrels
are
of
their
nature
painful
and
as
i
am
a
mirthloving
fellow
i
hate
to
bring
them
upon
me
but
perhaps
it
has
occurred
to
you
that
i
may
have
brought
some
disgrace
upon
the
name
i
have
forsaken
i
never
allowed
myself
to
think
so
said
sir
adrian
surprised
your
very
presence
by
my
fireside
is
proof
of
it
again
the
captain
scrutinised
his
host
then
with
a
little
laugh
pardon
me
he
cried
with
another
man
one
might
accept
that
likely
proof
and
be
flattered
but
with
you
why
i
believe
i
know
you
too
well
not
to
feel
sure
that
you
would
have
received
me
as
kindly
and
unreservedly
no
matter
what
my
past
if
only
you
thought
that
i
had
repented
that
you
would
forgive
even
a
crime
regretted
and
having
forgiven
forget
but
to
resume
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
no
he
went
on
with
a
musing
air
but
i
could
tell
you
of
a
boy
disliked
at
home
for
his
stubborn
spirit
and
one
day
thrashed
thrashed
mercilesslyat
a
time
when
he
had
thought
he
had
reached
to
the
pride
of
mans
estate
thrashed
by
his
own
father
and
for
no
just
cause
oh
adrian
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
have
put
such
resentment
into
a
lads
heart
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
placed
himself
before
the
hearth
if
ever
i
have
sons
he
added
after
a
pause
and
at
the
words
his
whole
handsome
face
relaxed
and
became
suffused
with
a
tender
glow
i
would
rather
cut
my
right
hand
off
than
raise
such
a
spirit
in
them
well
i
daresay
you
can
guess
the
rest
i
will
even
tell
you
in
a
few
words
and
then
dismiss
the
subjecti
have
always
had
a
certain
shrewdness
at
the
bottom
of
my
recklessness
now
there
was
a
cousin
of
the
family
who
had
taken
to
commerce
in
liverpool
and
who
was
therefore
despised
ignored
and
insulted
by
us
gentry
of
the
shaws
so
when
i
packed
my
bundle
and
walked
out
of
the
park
gate
i
thought
of
him
and
two
days
later
i
presented
myself
at
his
mansion
in
rodney
street
liverpool
i
told
him
my
name
whereat
he
scowled
but
he
was
promptly
brought
round
upon
hearing
of
my
firm
determination
to
renounce
it
and
all
relations
with
my
fathers
house
for
ever
and
of
my
reasons
for
this
resolve
which
he
found
excellent
i
could
not
have
lighted
upon
a
better
man
he
hated
my
family
as
heartily
as
even
i
could
wish
and
readily
out
of
spite
to
them
undertook
to
aid
me
he
was
a
most
enterprising
scoundrel
had
a
share
in
half
a
dozen
floating
ventures
i
expressed
a
desire
for
life
on
the
ocean
wave
and
he
started
me
merrily
as
his
nephew
jack
smith
to
learn
the
business
on
a
slaver
of
his
the
ebony
trade
you
know
was
all
the
go
then
adrian
many
great
gentlemen
in
lancashire
had
shares
in
it
now
it
is
considered
low
to
say
true
a
year
of
it
was
more
than
enough
for
metoo
much
it
sickened
me
my
uncle
laughed
when
i
demurred
at
a
second
journey
but
to
humour
me
as
i
had
learned
something
of
the
sailing
trade
he
found
me
another
berth
on
board
a
privateer
the
st
nicholas
my
fortune
was
made
from
the
moment
i
set
foot
on
that
lucky
ship
as
you
know
and
you
have
never
seen
your
father
since
neither
father
nor
brothers
nor
any
of
my
kin
save
the
cousin
in
question
all
i
know
is
that
my
father
is
deadthat
he
disinherited
me
expressly
in
the
event
of
my
being
still
in
the
flesh

eldest
brother

recently

it

bride
with
me
but
until
i
can
resume
my
name
in
all
freedom
this
cannot
be
but
why
my
dear
fellow
these
further
risks
and
adventures
surely
even
at
your
showing
you
have
enough
of
this
worlds
goods
why
not
come
forward
now
at
once
openly
i
will
introduce
you
as
soon
as
may
be
in
your
real
character
for
the
sake
of
your
motherof
madeleine
herself
the
sailor
shook
his
head
tempted
yet
determined
i
am
not
free
to
do
so
i
have
given
my
word
my
honour
is
engaged
he
said
then
abruptly
asked
have
you
ever
heard
of
guinea
smuggling
guinea
smuggling
no
said
sir
adrian
his
amazement
giving
way
to
anxiety
no
you
surprise
me
you
who
are
or
were
i
understand
a
student
of
philosophical
matters
freedom
of
exchange
and
international
intercourse
and
the
rest
of
itthings
we
never
shall
have
so
long
as
governments
want
money
i
am
thinkinghowever
this
guinea
smuggling
is
a
comparatively
new
business
now
i
dont
know
anything
about
the
theory
but
i
know
this
much
of
the
practice
that
while
our
preventive
service
wont
let
guineas
pass
the
channel
as
goods
this
year
somebody
on
the
other
side
is
devilish
anxious
to
have
them
at
almost
any
cost
and
the
cost
you
know
is
heavy
for
the
risk
of
confiscation
is
great
well
your
banker
or
your
rich
man
will
not
trust
his
bullion
to
your
common
free
traderhe
is
not
quite
such
a
fool
no
put
in
sir
adrian
as
the
other
paused
on
this
mocking
proposition
in
the
old
days
when
i
was
busy
in
promoting
the
savenaye
expedition
i
came
across
many
of
that
gentry
and
i
cannot
mind
a
case
where
they
could
have
been
trusted
with
such
a
freight
but
perhaps
he
added
with
a
small
smile
the
standard
may
be
higher
now
captain
jack
grinned
appreciatively
that
is
where
the
likes
of
me
comes
in
i
will
confess
this
not
to
be
my
first
attempt
it
is
known
that
i
am
one
of
the
few
whose
word
is
warranty
what
is
more
as
i
have
said
it
is
known
that
i
have
the
luck
thus
even
if
i
could
bring
my
own
name
into
such
a
trade
i
would
not
it
would
be
the
height
of
folly
to
change
now
for
all
his
disapproval
sir
adrian
could
not
repress
a
look
of
amusement
i
verily
believe
jack
he
said
shaking
his
head
that
you
are
as
superstitious
yourself
as
the
best
of
them
i
ought
to
make
a
good
thing
out
of
it
said
jack
evasively
and
even
with
all
that
is
lovely
to
keep
me
on
shore
i
would
hardly
give
it
up
if
i
could
as
things
stand
i
could
not
if
i
would
do
not
condemn
me
adrianthat
would
be
fatal
to
my
hopesnay
i
actually
want
your
help
i
would
you
were
out
of
it
reiterated
sir
adrian
it
takes
so
little
to
turn
the
current
of
a
mans
life
when
he
seems
to
be
making
straight
for
happiness
as
to
the
morals
of
it
i
fail
i
must
admit
to
perceive
any
wrong
in
smuggling
at
least
in
the
abstract
except
that
a
certain
kind
of
moral
teaches
that
all
is
wrong
that
is
against
the
law
and
yet
so
many
of
our
laws
are
so
ferocious
and
inept
and
as
such
the
very
cause
of
so
much
going
wrong
that
might
otherwise
go
well
so
many
of
those
who
administer
them
are
themselves
so
ferocious
and
inept
that
the
mere
fact
of
a
pursuit
being
unlawful
is
no
real
condemnation
in
my
eyes
but
as
you
know
jack
those
who
place
themselves
above
some
laws
almost
invariably
renounce
all
if
you
are
hanged
for
stealing
a
horse
or
breaking
some
fiscal
law
and
hanged
for
killing
a
man
the
tendency
under
stress
of
circumstances
is
obvious
aye
have
we
not
a
proverb
about
it
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
for
a
lamb
there
are
gruesome
stories
about
your
free
tradersand
gruesome
endings
to
them
i
well
remember
in
my
young
days
the
clanking
gibbet
on
the
sands
near
preston
and
the
three
tarred
and
ironriveted
carcases
hanging
each
in
its
chains
with
the
perpetual
guard
of
carrion
crows
hanging
in
chains
is
still
on
the
statute
book
i
believe
but
ill
stop
my
croaking
now
you
are
not
one
to
be
drawn
into
brutal
ways
nor
one
i
fear
to
be
frightened
into
prudence
nevertheless
laughing
quietly
i
am
curious
to
know
in
what
way
you
expect
help
from
me
in
practice
do
you
seriously
want
me
to
embark
actually
on
a
smuggling
expeditioni
demur
my
dear
fellow
obviously
relieved
of
some
anxiety
the
other
burst
out
laughing
never
fear
i
know
your
dislike
to
bilge
water
too
well
i
appreciate
too
well
also
your
comfortable
surroundings
he
returned
seating
himself
once
more
complacently
in
his
armchair
much
as
i
should
love
your
company
on
board
my
pleasure
shipfor
if
you
please
the
peregrine
is
no
smuggling
lugger
but
professes
to
be
a
yacht
still
you
can
be
of
help
for
all
that
and
without
lifting
even
a
finger
to
promote
this
illicit
trade
you
may
ignore
it
completely
and
yet
you
will
render
me
incalculable
service
provided
you
do
not
debar
me
from
paying
you
a
few
more
visits
in
your
solitude
and
give
me
the
range
of
your
caves
and
cellars
you
are
welcome
enough
said
the
recluse
i
trust
it
may
end
as
well
as
it
promises
and
after
a
pause
madeleine
does
not
know
the
nature
of
your
present
pursuit
oddly
enough
and
happily
for
our
moments
of
interview
are
short
as
you
may
imagine
she
is
not
curious
on
the
subject
i
dont
know
what
notions
the
old
lady
maria
may
have
put
into
her
head
about
me
i
think
she
believes
that
i
am
engaged
on
some
secret
political
intrigue
and
approves
of
such
at
least
i
gathered
as
much
from
her
sympathetic
reticence
and
between
ourselves
i
am
beginning
to
believe
it
myself
how
is
that
asked
the
listener
moved
to
fresh
astonishment
by
this
new
departure
well
i
may
tell
you
who
not
only
can
be
as
silent
as
the
tomb
but
really
have
a
right
to
know
since
you
are
tacitly
of
the
conspiracy
this
time
the
transaction
is
to
be
with
some
official
of
the
french
court
they
want
the
metal
and
yet
wish
to
have
it
secretly
what
their
motive
may
be
is
food
for
reflection
if
you
like
but
it
is
no
business
of
mine
and
besides
the
fact
that
one
journey
will
suffice
for
a
sum
which
at
the
previous
rate
would
have
required
half
a
score
all
the
trouble
and
uncertainty
of
landing
are
disposed
of
at
any
rate
i
am
when
all
is
ready
to
be
met
by
a
government
vessel
get
my
quid
pro
quo
as
will
be
settled
and
there
the
matter
is
to
end
a
curious
expedition
mused
sir
adrian
yes
said
the
sailor
my
last
will
be
the
best
by
the
way
will
you
embark
a
few
bags
with
me
i
will
take
no
commission
sir
adrian
could
not
help
laughing
no
thank
you
i
have
no
wish
to
launch
any
more
of
my
patrimony
on
venturessince
it
would
be
of
no
service
to
you
i
had
almost
as
lief
you
had
made
use
of
my
old
crows
nest
without
letting
me
into
the
ins
and
outs
of
your
projects
but
be
it
as
it
may
it
is
yours
night
and
day
your
visits
i
shall
take
as
being
for
me
what
a
man
you
are
upon
my
soul
sir
adrian
cried
captain
jack
enthusiastically





later
on
when
the
shaking
down
hour
in
captain
jacks
phraseology
had
sounded
and
the
two
friends
separated
to
rest
the
young
man
refused
the
offer
dictated
by
hospitality
of
his
hosts
own
bedroom
sir
adrian
did
not
press
the
point
and
leaving
his
guest
at
liberty
to
enjoy
the
couch
arranged
by
ren
in
a
corner
under
the
bookshelves
even
as
when
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
had
been
the
guest
of
the
peel
himself
retired
to
that
now
hallowed
apartment
odd
fellow
that
soliloquised
captain
jack
as
slowly
divesting
himself
he
paced
about
the
long
room
and
in
the
midst
of
roseate
reflections
examined
his
curious
abode
withal
as
good
as
ever
stepped
it
was
a
fine
days
work
our
old
st
nicholas
did
about
this
time
eight
years
ago
rather
unlike
a
crowded
battery
deck
this
looking
from
the
solemn
books
to
the
glinting
organ
pipes
and
conscious
of
the
great
silence
as
for
me
i
should
go
crazy
by
myself
here
but
it
suits
him
queer
fish
again
ruminated
the
young
sailor
he
hates
no
one
and
yet
dislikes
almost
everybody
except
that
funny
little
frenchy
and
me
whereas
i
like
every
man
i
meetunless
i
detest
him
my
beautiful
plumage
this
whilst
carefully
folding
the
superfine
coat
and
thereon
the
endless
silken
stock
now
theres
a
fellow
who
does
not
care
a
hang
for
any
woman
under
the
sun
and
yet
enters
into
another
chaps
love
affairs
as
if
he
understood
it
all
i
believe
it
will
make
him
happy
to
win
my
cause
with
madeleine
i
wish
one
could
do
something
for
his
happiness
it
is
absurd
you
know
as
though
apostrophising
an
objector
a
man
cant
be
happy
without
a
woman
and
yet
again
my
good
jack
you
never
thought
that
before
you
met
madeleine
he
has
not
met
his
madeleine
thats
what
it
means
where
ignorance
is
bliss
friend
adrian
let
us
console
ourselves
and
call
you
ignorantly
happy
in
your
old
crows
nest
you
have
not
stocked
it
so
badly
eitherfor
all
your
ignorance
in
love
you
have
a
pretty
taste
in
liquor
so
thinking
he
poured
himself
a
last
glass
of
his
hosts
wine
which
he
held
for
a
moment
in
smiling
cogitation
looking
with
the
minds
eye
through
the
thick
walls
of
the
keep
across
the
cold
mistcovered
sands
of
scarthey
and
again
through
the
warm
and
scented
air
of
a
certain
room
imagination
pictured
where
madeleine
must
at
that
hour
lie
in
her
slumber
after
a
moment
of
silent
adoration
he
sent
a
rapturous
kiss
landwards
and
tossed
his
glass
with
a
last
toast
madeleine
my
sweet
to
your
softly
closed
lids
and
again
captain
jack
fell
to
telling
over
the
precious
tale
of
that
mornings
interview
furtively
secured
by
that
lovers
luck
he
so
dutifully
blessed

the
plot
tantys
wrath
upon
discovering
sir
adrians
departure
was
all
the
greater
because
she
could
extort
no
real
explanation
from
rupert
and
because
her
attacks
rebounded
as
it

from
the
polished
surface
he
exposed
to
them
on
every

further
discomposed
her
during

and
upon
the
latter
young
ladys
disappearance
after
the
meal
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
finish
her
nightly
game
of
patience
before
mounting
to
seek
her
with
the

relieving

overcharged

procuring
what

she
might
the

made
miss

halt
upon
the
threshold
the
hot
wind
of
anger
upon
which
she
seemed
to
be
propelled
into
the
room
falling
into
sudden
nothingness
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
molly
was
weeping
so
energetically
indeed
with
such
a
passion
of
tears
and
sobs
that
the
noise
of
tantys
tumultuous
entrance
fell
unheeded
upon
her
ears
all
her
sympathies
stirred
within
her
the
old
lady
advanced
to
the
girl
with
the
intention
of
gathering
her
to
her
bosom
but
as
she
drew
near
the
black
and
white
of
the
open
diary
attracted
her
eye
under
the
circle
of
lamplight
and
being
possessed
of
excellent
long
sight
she
thought
it
no

to
utilise

across

before
making

her
presence
and
so
i
sit
and
cry
miss
molly
was
carrying
out
her
programme
with
much
precision
if
indeed
her
attitude
prone
along
the
table
could
be
described
as
sitting
miss
odonoghues
eyes
and
mouth
grew
round
as
with
the
expression
of
an
outraged
cockatoo
she
read
and
reread
the
telltale
phrases
here
was
a
complication
she
had
not
calculated
upon
dear
dear
she
cried
clacking
her
tongue
in
disconsolate
fashion
so
soon
as
she
could
get
her
breath
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
my
poor
girl
molly
leaped
to
her
feet
and
turning
a
blazing
disfigured
countenance
upon
her
relative
exclaimed
with
more
energy
than
politeness
good
gracious
aunt
what
do
you
want
then
catching
sight
of
the
open
diary
she
looked
suspiciously
from
it
to
her
visitor
and
closed
it
with
a
hasty
hand
but
miss
odonoghues
next
words
settled
the
doubt
well
to
be
sure
what
a
state
you
have
put
yourself
into
she
pursued
in
genuine
distress
what
has
happened
then
between
you
and
that
fellow
whom
i
declare
i
begin
to
believe
as
crazy
as
rupert
says
that
you
should
be
crying
your
eyes
out
over
his
going
back
to
his
islandyou
that
i
thought
could
not
shed
a
tear
if
you
tried
nothing
left
but
to
sit
and
cry
indeed
so
you
have
been
reading
my
diary
you
mean
thing
cried
miss
molly
stamping
her
foot
how
dare
you
come
creeping
in
here
spying
at
my
private
concerns
oh
oh
oh
with
unpremeditated
artfulness
relapsing
into
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
just
in
time
to
avert
the
volley
of
rebuke
with
which
the
hottempered
old
lady
was
about
to
greet
this
disrespectful
outburst
i
am
the
most
miserable
girl
in
all
the
world
i
wish
i
were
dead
i
do
again
tanty
opened
her
arms
and
this
time
she
did
draw
the
stormy
creature
to
a
bosom
as
warm
and
motherly
as
if
all
the
joys
of
womanhood
had
not
been
withheld
from
it
tell
me
all
about
it
my
poor
child
there
was
a
distinct
feeling
of
comfort
in
the
grasp
of
the
old
arms
comfort
in
the
very
ring
of
the
deep
voice
molly
was
not
a
secretive
person
by
nature
and
moreover
she
retained
quite
enough
shrewdness
even
in
her
unwonted
breakdown
to
conjecture
that
with
tanty
lay
her
sole
hope
of
help
so
rolling
her
dark
head
distractedly
on
the
old
maids
shoulder
the
young
maid
narrated
her
tale
of
woe
pressed
by
a
pointed
question
here
and
there
tanty
soon
collected
a
series
of
impressions
of
mollys
visit
to
scarthey
that
set
her
busy
mind
working
upon
a
startlingly
new
line
it
was
her
nature
to
jump
at
conclusions
and
it
was
not
strange
that
the
girls
passionate
display
of
grief
should
seem
to
be
the
unmistakable
outcome
of
tenderer
feelings
than
the
wounded
pride
and
disappointment
which
were
in
reality
its
sole
motors
i
am
convinced
it
is
rupert
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
cried
molly
at
last
springing
into
uprightness
again
and
clenching
her
hands
his
one
idea
is
to
drive
his
brother
permanently
from
his
own
homeand
he
hates
me
tanty
sat
rigid
with
thought
so
molly
was
in
love
with
sir
adrian
landale
and
hewho
knowswas
in
love
with
her
too
or
if
not
with
her
with
her
likeness
to
her
mother
and
that
was
much
the
same
thing
when
all
was
said
and
done
could
anything
be
more
suitable
more
fortunate
could
ever
two
birds
be
killed
with
one
stone
with
more
complete
felicity
than
in
this
settling
of
the
two
people
she
most
loved
upon
earth
poor
pretty
molly
the
old
ladys
heart
grew
very
tender
over
the
girl
who
now
stood
half
sullenly
half
bashfully
averting
her
swollen
face
five
days
ago
she
had
not
known
her
handsome
cousin
and
now
she
was
breaking
her
heart
for
him
it
might
be
indeed
as
she
said
that
they
had
to
thank
rupert
for
thisand
off
flew
tantys
mind
upon
another
tangent
rupert
was
very
deep
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
he
was
anxious
enough
to
keep
adrian
away
from
them
all
what
would
it
be
then
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
his
marriage
tanty
with
the
delightful
optimism
that
seventy
years
experience
had
failed
to
damp
here
became
confident
of
the
approach
of
her
younger
nephews
complete
discomfiture
and
in
the
cheering
contemplation
of
that
event
chuckled
so
unctuously
that
molly
looked
at
her
amazed
it
is
well
for
you
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
rising
and
wagging
her
head
with
an
air
of
enigmatic
resolution
that
you
have
got
an
aunt





some
two
days
later
ren
sitting
upon
a
ledge
of
the
old
scarthey
wall
in
the
spare
sunshine
which
this
still
winters
noon
shone
pearllike
through
a
universal
mist
busy
mending
a
net
to
the
tune
of
a
melancholy
inward
whistle
heard
up
above
the
licking
of
the
waves
all
around
him
and
the
whimper
of
the
seagulls
overhead
the
beat
of
steady
oars
approaching
from
land
side
starting
to
his
feet
the
little
man
in
vague
expectation
ran
to
a
point
of
vantage
from
which
to
scan
the
tideway
after
a
few
seconds
investigation
he
turned
tail
dashed
into
the
ruins
up
the
steps
and
burst
open
the
door
of
the
sittingroom
calling
upon
his
master
with
a
scared
expression
of
astonishment
captain
jack
poring
over
a
map
his
pipe
sticking
rakishly
out
of
one
side
of
his
mouth
looked
up
amused
at
the
frenchmans
evident
excitement
while
adrian
who
had
been
busy
with
the
uppermost
row
of
books
upon
his
west
wall
looked
down
from
his
ladder
perch
with
the
pessimists
constitutional
expectation
of
evil
growing
upon
his
face
one
comes
in
a
boat
ejaculated
ren
and
i
thought
i
ought
to
warn
his
honour
if
his
honour
will
give
himself
the
trouble
to
look
out
it
must
be
the
devil
to
frighten
renny
in
this
fashion
muttered
captain
jack
as
distinctly
as
the
clench
of
his
teeth
upon
the
pipe
would
allow
him
sir
adrian
paled
a
little
he
began
to
descend
his
ladder
mechanically
flicking
the
dust
from
his
cuffs
your
honour
said
ren
drawing
to
the
window
and
looking
out
cautiously
i
have
not
yet
seen
her
but
i
believe
it
is
old
missthe
aunt
of
your
honour
and
these
ladies
captain
jacks
pipe
fell
from
his
dropping
jaw
and
was
broken
into
many
fragments
as
he
leaped
to
his
feet
with
an
elasticity
of
limb
and
a
richness
of
expletive
which
of
themselves
would
have
betrayed
his
calling
flinging
his
arm
across
one
of
adrians
shoulders
he
peeped
across
the
other
out
of
the
window
with
an
alarm
half
mocking
half
genuine
the
devil
it
is
friend
renny
he
cried
drawing
back
and
running
his
hands
with
an
exaggerated
gesture
of
despair
through
his
brown
curls
adrian
all
is
lost
unless
you
hide
me
my
aunt
here
and
alone
exclaimed
adrian
retreating
from
the
window
perturbed
enough
himself
i
must
go
down
to
meet
her
pray
god
it
is
no
ill
news
hurry
renny
clear
these
glasses
away
in
the
name
of
all
thats
sacred
clear
me
away
first
interposed
captain
jack
this
time
with
a
real
urgency
through
the
open
lattice
came
the
sound
of
the
grating
of
the
boats
keel
upon
the
sand
and
a
vigorous
hail
from
a
masculine
throatahoy
renny
potter
ahoy
adrian
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
my
hopes
hide
me
in
your
lowest
dungeon
for
goodness
sake
i
do
not
know
my
way
about
your
ruins
and
i
am
convinced
the
old
lady
will
nose
me
out
like
a
badger
there
was
no
time
for
explanation
sir
adrian
made
a
sign
to
ren
who
highly
enjoying
the
situation
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
was
already
volunteering
to
well
hide
mr
the
captain
and
the
pair
disappeared
with
much
celerity
into
the
inner
room
while
adrian
unable
to
afford
himself
further
preparation
hurried
down
the
great
stairs
to
meet
this
unexpected
guest
he
emerged
bareheaded
into
the
curious
mist
which
hung
palllike
upon
the
outer
world
and
seemed
to
combine
the
opposite
elements
of
glare
and
dulness
just
as
tanty
aided
by
the
stalwart
arm
of
the
boatman
who
had
rowed
her
across
succeeded
in
dragging
her
rheumatic
limbs
up
the
last
bit
of
ascent
to
the
door
of
the
keep
she
halted
disengaged
herself
and
puffing
and
blowing
surveyed
her
nephew
with
a
stony
gaze
my
dear
aunt
cried
adrian
nothing
has
happened
i
trust
sufficient
has
already
happened
nephew
i
should
hope
retorted
the
old
lady
with
extreme
dignity
sufficient
to
make
me
desire
to
confer
with
you
most
seriously
i
thank
you
young
man
turning
to
william
shearman
who
stood
on
one
side
his
eager
gaze
upon
the
master
ready
to
pull
his
forelock
so
soon
as
he
could
catch
his
eye
be
here
again
in
an
hour
if
you
please
but
you
will
allow
me
to
escort
you
myself
exclaimed
adrian
rising
to
the
situation
and
i
hope
there
need
be
no
hurry
so
long
as
daylight
lastsgoodmorning
will
i
am
glad
the
new
craft
is
a
successyou
need
not
wait
tanty
take
my
arm
i
beg
the
steps
are
steep
and
rough
gripping
her
nephews
arm
with
her
bony
old
womans
hand
miss
odonoghue
began
a
laborious
ascent
pausing
every
five
steps
to
breathe
stertorously
and
reproachfully
and
look
round
upon
the
sandstone
walls
with
supreme
disdain
but
this
was
nothing
to
the
air
with
which
when
at
last
installed
upon
a
high
hard
chair
in
the
sittingroom
having
sternly
refused
the
easy
one
sir
adrian
humbly
proffered
she
deliberately
proceeded
to
survey
the
scene
in
truth
the
neatness
that
usually
characterised
adrians
surroundings
was
conspicuously
absent
from
them
just
then
two
or
three
maps
lay
overlapping
each
other
upon
the
table
beside
the
tray
with
its
flagon
of
amber
ale
which
had
formed
the
captains
morning
draught
and
the
soiled
glass
the
fragments
of
his
pipe
and
its
halfburnt
contents
lay
strewn
about
the
prostrate
chair
which
that
lively
individual
had
upset
in
his
agitation
adrians
ladder
the
books
he
had
been
handling
and
had
not
replaced
the
white
ash
of
the
dying
fire
all
contributed
to
the
unwonted
aspect
of
somewhat
melancholy
disorder
worse
than
all
the
fumes
of
the
strong
tobacco
which
the
sailor
liked
to
smoke
in
his
secluded
moments
hung
rank
despite
the
open
window
upon
the
absolute
motionlessness
of
the
atmosphere
tanty
snorted
and
sniffed
while
adrian
after
picking
up
the
chair
began
to
almost
unconsciously
refold
the
maps
his
eyes
fixed
wonderingly
upon
his
visitors
face
this
latter
delivered
herself
at
length
of
some
of
the
indignation
that
was
choking
her
in
abrupt
disjointed
sentences
as
if
she
were
uncorking
so
many
bottles
well
im
sure
nephew
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
extraordinary
behaviour
and
if
this
is
the
style
you
prefer
to
live
instyle
did
i
saysty
would
be
more
appropriate
of
course
it
is
only
what
i
have
been
led
to
expect
but
i
must
say
i
was
ill
prepared
to
be
treated
by
you
with
actual
disrespect
my
sisters
child
and
i
your
guest
not
to
speak
of
your
aunt
and
you
your
mothers
son
and
her
host
besides
it
is
a
slap
in
the
face
adrian
a
slap
in
the
face
which
has
been
a
very
bitter
pill
to
have
to
swallow
i
assure
youi
may
say
without
exaggeration
in
fact
that
it
has
cut
me
to
the
quick
but
surely
cried
the
nephew
laughing
with
gentle
indulgence
at
this
complicated
indictment
surely
you
cannot
suppose
i
would
have
been
willingly
guilty
of
the
smallest
disrespect
to
you
i
am
a
most
unfortunate
man
most
unfortunately
situated
and
if
i
have
offended
it
is
you
must
believe
unwittingly
and
unavoidably
but
you
got
my
letteri
made
my
motives
clear
to
you
oh
yes
i
got
your
letter
yesterday
responded
tanty
not
at
all
softened
and
a
more
idiotic
production
from
a
man
of
your
attainments
allow
me
to
remark
i
never
read
adrian
you
are
making
a
perfect
fool
of
yourself
and
you
cannot
afford
it
i
fear
you
will
never
really
understand
my
position
murmured
adrian
hopelessly
tanty
rattled
her
large
green
umbrella
upon
the
floor
with
a
violence
that
made
her
nephew
start
then
turned
upon
him
a
countenance
inflamed
with
righteous
anger
it
is
only
three
days
ago
since
i
gave
you
fully
my
view
of
the
situation
she
remarked
you
were
good
enough
at
the
time
to
admit
that
it
was
a
remarkably
wellbalanced
one
i
should
be
glad
if
you
will
explain
in
what
manner
your
position
could
have
changed
in
the
space
of
just
three
hours
after
to
lead
you
to
rush
back
to
your
island
really
as
if
you
were
a
mole
or
a
wild
indian
or
some
other
strange
animal
that
could
not
bear
civilised
society
without
even
so
much
as
a
goodbye

not

muttered
adrian
again
rose
up
stiffly
in
a
sort
of
horrified
astonishment
and
then
sat
down
again
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
like
a
man
striving
to
awaken
from
a
painful
dream
oh
adrian
dont
be
more
of
a
fool
than
you

his
relative
exasperated
beyond
all
expression
by
his
inarticulate
distress
you
are
so
busy
contemplating

sorts

absurdities
miles

i
verily
believe
you
cannot
see
an
inch
beyond
your
nose
my
gracious
what
is
there
to
be
so
astonished
at
how
did
you
behave
to
the
poor
innocent
from
the
very
instant
she
crossed
your
threshold
fact
is
you
have
been

regular

tanty
starting
again
upon
her
fine
vein
of
metaphordid
you
not
deliberately
hold
the
cup
of
love
to
those
young
lips
only
to
nip
it
in
the
bud
the

not
a
stock

a

you
are

the
long
and
the
short
of

sown
tanty
who
had
been
holding
forth
with
the
rapidity
of
a
loose
windmill
in
a
hurricane
here
found
herself
forced
to
pause
and
take
breath
which
she
did
fanning
herself
with
much
energy
a
triumphant
consciousness
of
the
unimpeachability
of
her
logic
written
upon
her
heated
countenance
but
adrian
still
stared
at
her
with
the
same
incredulous
dismay
looking
indeed
as
little
like
a
gay
lothario
as
it
was
possible
even
for
him
do
you
mean
he
said
at
last
in
slow
broken
sentences
as
his
mind
wrestled
with
the
strange
tidings

oh
my

striving
with
a
laugh
the
idea
is
too
absurd
i
am
old
enough
to
be
her
father
you
knowwhat
evidence
can
you
have
for
a
statement
so
distressing
so
extraordinary
i
am
not
quite
in

over

cruelty

he
paused
and
a
deep
flush
overspread
his
face
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
except
indeed
in
the
first
moment
of
her
arrivalwhen
she
came
in
upon
me
as
i
was
lost
in
memories
of
the
pastlike
the
spirit
of
ccile
humph
said
tanty
pointedly
but
then
you
see
what
you
took
for
cciles
spirit
happened
to
be
molly
in
the
flesh
she
fixed
her
sharp
eyes
upon
her
nephew
who
struck
into
confusion
by
her
words
seemed
for
the
moment
unable
to
answer
then
as
if
satisfied
with
the
impression
produced
she
folded
her
hands
over
the
umbrella
handle
and
observed
in
more
placid
tones
than
she
had
yet
used
and
now
we
must
see
what
is
to
be
done
adrian
began
to
pace
the
room
in
greater
perturbation
what
is
to
be
done
he
repeated
alas
what
can
be
done
tanty
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
should
have
cut
off
my
right
hand
rather
than
brought
this
thing
upon
the
childbut
she
is
very
youngthe
impression
thank
heaven
cannot
in
the
nature
of
things
endure
she
will
meet
some
one
worthy
of
herwith
you
tanty
kindest
of
hearts
i
can
safely
trust
her
future
but
that
she
should
suffer
now
and
through
me
that
bright
creature
who
flitted
in
upon
my
dark
life
like
some
heavensent
messengerthese
are
evil
tidings
tanty
you
must
take
her
away
you
must
distract
her
mind
you
must
tell
her
what
a
poor
brokendown
being
i
am
how
little
worthy
of
her
sweet
thoughts
and
she
will
learn
soon
learn
to
forget
me
to
laugh
at
herself
although
addressing
the
old
lady
he
spoke
like
a
man
reasoning
with
himself
and
the
words
dropped
from
his
lips
as
if
drawn
from
a
very
well
of
bitterness
tanty
listened
to
him
in
silence
but
the
tension
of
her
whole
frame
betrayed
that
she
was
only
gathering
her
forces
for
another
explosion
when
adrians
voice
ceased
there
was
a
moments
silence
and
then
the
storm
burst
whisking
herself
out
of
her
chair
the
umbrella
came
into
play
once
more
but
though
it
was
only
to
thump
the
table
it
was
evident
miss
odonoghue
would
more
willingly
have
laid
it
about
the
delinquents
shoulders
adrian
are
you
a
man
at
all
she
ejaculated
fiercely
then
with
sudden
deadly
composure
so
this
is
the
reparation
you
propose
to
make
for
the
mischief
you
have
wrought
in
gods
name
cried
he
goaded
at
length
into
some
sort
of
despairing
anger
himself
what
would
you
have
me
do
the
answer
came
with
the
promptitude
of
a
return
shot
do
why

her
of
course
marry
her
there
was
a
breathless
pause
tanty
leaning
forward
across
the
table
crimson
agitated
yet
triumphant
adrians
white
face
blasted
with
astonishment
marry
her
he
echoed
at
length
once
more
in
a
whisper
this
time
then
with
a
groan
this
is
madness
miss
odonoghue
caught
him
up
briskly

if
you

pain
in

you
would
try
the
patience
of

why
i
dont
believe
there
is
another
man
on
earth
that
would
not
be
wild
with
joy
at
the
mere
thought
of
having
gained
such
a
prize
a
beautiful
creature
with
a
heart
of
gold
and
a
purse
of
gold
to
boot
oh
heavens
aunt
interrupted
the
man
passionately
leave
that
question
out
of
the
reckoning
the
one
thing
the
only
thing
to
consider
is
her
happiness
you
cannot
make
me
believe
it
can
be
for
her
happiness
that
she
should
marry
such
as
me
and
why
shouldnt
it
be
for
her
happiness
answered
the
dauntless
old
lady
was
not
she
happy
enough
with
you
here
in
this
godforsaken
hole
with
nothing
but
the
tempest
besides
for
company
why
should
not
she
be
happy
then
when
you
come
back
to
your
own
good
place
would
not
you
be

not

why
adrian
cried
tanty
charmed
at
this
unexpected
disclosure
of
feeling
and
the
accent
with
which
it
was
delivered
i
declare
you
are
as
much
in
love
with
the
girl
as
she
is
with
you
why
now
you
shall
just
come
back
with
me
to
pulwick
this
moment
and
she
shall
tell
you
herself
if
she
can
find
happiness
with
you
or
not
ohi
will
hear

as
a
man
of
honour
all
point
my
dear
nephew
in
the
same
direction
and
if
you
neglect
this
warning
voice
you
will
be
blind
indeed
to
the
call
of
duty
come
now
come
back
to
your
home
where
the
sweetest
wife
ever
a
man
had
awaits
you
and
when
i
shall
see
the
children
spring
up
around
you
adrian
then
god
will
have
granted
my
last
wish
and
i
shall
die
in
peace
there
there
i
am
an
old
fool

full
then
the
tears

ill
say
no
more

the
sight
of
the
poor
child

plead
for
her
happiness

in
your
ear

bark
and
snarl

generosity
has
made
of
him

let
us
proceed





silence
had
reigned
for
but
a
few
seconds
in
the
great
room
of
the
keep
when
captain
jack
reentered
bearing
on
his
face
an
expression
at
once
boyishly
jubilant
and
mockingly
astonished
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
landward
window
and
gazed
forth
a
while
there
goes

old

a
rarely

of

their

fell
promptly
into
his

state
of

during
the

from

winding
up

shrewd
but
he
could

upon
me

indeed

very
tales

suspected

too
well
would
have
proved
had
it
not
been
for
the
new
unforeseen
motive
that
the
mornings
revelation
had
brought
does
molly
know
of
your
visit
to
me
he
asked
as
the
carriage
halted
before
the
gate
and
the
enormous
redheaded
cumbrian
gatekeeper
with
his
rosy
moggie
proudly
swung
it
open
to
stand
on
either
side
the
one
bowing
with
jubilant
greeting
and
the
other
curtseying
with
bashful
smiles
at
the
real
master
does
she
expect
my
visit
relapsing
into
gravity
after
returning
the
salutation
in
kindliness
i
have
told
no
one
of
my
purpose
this
day
rupert
walked
off
to
the
stables
immediately
after
breakfastgoing
ahunting
he
said
he
was
and
offered
to
bear
the
girls
to
the
meet
and
then
feeling
lonely
without
his
company
added
tanty
with
a
wink
i
ordered
the
carriage
and
thought
i
would
go
and
have
a
peep
at
the
place
where
poor
molly
was
drowned
just
for
a
little
diversion
whether
the
little
rogue
expects
you
or
not
after
your
note
of
the
other
day
i
am
sure
i
could
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
she
sits
watching
that
crazy
old
tower
of
yours
by
day
and
your
light
by
night
well
well
i
must
not
tell
tales
out
of
school
you
may
find
out
for
yourself
but
mind
you
adrian
she
impressed
on
him
sagely
it
is
not
i
who
bring
you
back
you
return
of
your
own
accord
the
child
would
murder
me
if
she
knewwith
that
proud
heart
of
hers
my
dear
tanty
trust
me
this
incomprehensible
discovery
of
yours
which
i
cannot
yet
believe
in
really
is
so
far
as
my
discretion
is
concerned
as
if
i
had
never
heard
of
it
heavens
i
have
been
a
blundering
fool
but
i
could
not
insult
her
with
a
hint
of
it
for
the
world
i
have
come
to
see
rupert
today
as
usual
of
courseand
as
you
say

i
shall
see
for
myself
you
have
opened
my
eyes
miss
odonoghue
looked
at
her
nephew
with
admiration

even
a
doleful
sir
adrian
faith
here
we
are
this
has
been
a
pleasant
ride
but
my
old
bones
are
so
tired
and
you
and
yours
have
set
them
jogging
so
much
of
late
that
i
think
ill
never
want
to
stir
a
foot
again
once
i
get
back
to
bunratty

except
indeed
to
come
and
be
godmother
to
the
heir
having
lent
a
dutiful
arm
up
the
stairs
to
his
now
beaming
relative
sir
adrian
came
down
pensively
and
entered
the
library
there
booted
and
spurred
but
quietly
installed
at
a
writing
table
sat
mr
landale
who
rose
in
his
nonchalant
manner
and
with
cold
looks
met
his
brother
there
was
no
greeting
between
them
but
simply
thus
i
understood
from
aunt
rose
you
were
out
hunting
such
was
my
intention
but
when
i
found
out
that
she
had
gone
to
see
youdont
look
so
astonished
adriana
man
must
know
what
is
going
on
in
his
householdi
suspected
you
would
escort
her
back
so
i
desisted
and
waited
for
you
it
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
to
see
you
for
i
thought
we
had
sufficiently
discussed
all
business
recently
but
doubtless
you
will
profit
of
the
opportunity
to
go
into
a
few
matters
which
want
your
attention
do
you
mean
to
remain
speaking
these
words
in
a
detached
manner
mr
landale
kept
a
keenly
observant
look
upon
his
brothers
countenance
in
a
most
unwonted
way
the
tone
and
the
look
irritated
sir
adrian
i
came
back
rupert
because
there
were
some
things
i
wished
to
see
for
myself
here
he
answered
frigidly
and
going
to
the
bell
rang
it
vigorously
on
the
servants
appearance
without
reference
to
his
brother
he
himself
and
very
shortly
gave
orders
i
shall
dine
here
today
have
the
tapestryroom
made
ready
for
me
then
turning
to
rupert
whose
face
betrayed
some
of
the
astonishment
aroused
by
this
most
unusual
assumption
of
authority
and
resuming
as
it
were
the
thread
of
his
speech
he
went
on
no
rupert
i
have
no
desire
to
talk
business
with
you
it
is
a
pity
you
should
have
given
up
your
day
is
it
yet
too
late
upon
my
word
adrian
said
mr
landale
clenching
his
hand
nervously
round
his
fine
cambric
handkerchief
there
must
be
something
of
importance
in
the
wind
to
have
altered
your
bearing
towards
me
to
this
extent
i
have
no
wish
to
interfere
i
came
back
and
gave
up
good
company
for
the
reason
i
have
stated
i
will
now
only
point
out
that
with
your
sudden
whims
you
render
my
position
excessively
false
in
a
house
where
at
your
own
wish
i
am
ostensibly
established
as
master
and
without
waiting
for
another
word
the
younger
brother
having
shot
the
arrow
which
hitherto
never
failed
to
reach
the
bullseye
of
the
situation
left
the
room
with
much
dignity
once
more
alone
sir
adrian
standing
motionless
in
the
great
room
darkened
yet
more
in
the
winter
light
by
the
heavy
festoons
of
curtains
that
hung
over
the
numerous
empty
bookshelves
the
souls
of
which
had
migrated
to
the
peel
to
keep
the
master
company
cogitated
upon
this
first
unpleasant
step
in
his
new
departure
and
wondered
within
himself
why
he
had
felt
so
extraordinarily
moved
by
anger
today
at
the
cold
inquisitiveness
of
his
brother
no
doubt
the
sense
of
being
watched
thus
held
away
at
armslength
as
it
were
was
cause
sufficient
and
yet
that
was
not
it
ingratitude
alone
even
to
enmity
in
return
for
benefits
forgot
could
not
rouse
this
bitterness
but
had
it
not
been
for
tantys
interference
he
would
be
now
exiled
from
his
home
until
the
departure
of
cciles
child
just
as
but
for
chance
he
would
have
been
kept
in
actual
ignorance
of
her
arrival
it
was
his
brothers
doing
that
he
had
blindly
withdrawn
himself
when
his
presence
would
have
caused
happiness
to
her
yes
that
was
it
rupert
had
a
scheme
that
was
what
dwelt
in
his
eyesa
scheme
which
would
bring
indeed
did
bring
unhappiness
to
that
dear
guest
no
wonder
now
that
the
unconscious
realisation
of
it
awoke
all
the
mans
blood
in
him
no
rupert
sir
adrian
found
himself
saying
aloud
i
let
you
reign
at
pulwick
so
long
as
you
crossed
not
one
jot
of
such
pleasure
and
happiness
that
might
belong
to
cciles
child
but
here
our
wills
clash
and
now
since
there
cannot
be
two
masters
in
a
house
as
you
say
i
am
the
master
here





as
sir
adrians
mind
was
seething
in
this
unusual
mood
miss
odonoghue
entering
her
nieces
room
found
molly
perched
in
riding
dress
on
the
windowsill
looking
forth
upon
the
outer
world
with
dissatisfied
countenance
mr
landale
had
sent
word
at
the
last
moment
that
to
his
intense
regret
he
could
not
escort
the
ladies
to
the
meet
some
important
business
having
retained
him
at
pulwick
so
much
did
miss
molly
pettishly
explain
in
answer
to
the
affectionate
inquiry
concerning
the
cloud
on
her
brow
slashing
her
whip
the
while
and
pouting
and
generally
out
of
harmony
with
the
special
radiance
of
the
old
ladys
eye
and
the
more
than
usual
expansiveness
of
the
embrace
which
was
bestowed
upon
her
tut
tut
tut
now
observed
the
artful
person
in
tones
of
deep
commiseration
ah
well
ruperts
a
poor
creature
which
ever
side
he
turns
up
will
you
go
now
my
child
and
fetch
me
the
letters
i
left
on
the
drawingroom
table
isnt
it
like
me
to
spend
half
the
morning
writing
them
and
leave
them
down
there
after
all
molly
rose
unwillingly
threw
her
whip
on
the
bed
her
hat
on
the
floor
and
mistily
concerned
over
tantys
air
of
irrepressible
and
pleasurable
excitement
walked
out
of
the
room
bestowing
as
she
passed
her
long
pier
glass
a
moody
glance
at
her
own
glowering
beauty
whats
the
use
of
you
she
muttered
to
herself
anybody
can
fetch
and
carry
for
old
aunts
and
look
out
of
windows
on
leafless
trees
the
way
to
the
drawingroom
was
through
the
library
as
molly
immersed
in
her
reflections
passed
along
this
room
she
stopped
with
a
violent
start
on
perceiving
the
figure
of
sir
adrian
a
tall
silhouette
against
the
cold
light
of
the
window
as
she
came
upon
him
her
face
was
fully
illumined
and
there
was
a
glorious
taletelling
in
the
widening
of
her
eyes
and
the
warm
flush
that
mounted
to
her
cheek
that
on
the
instant
scattered
in
the
mans
mind
all
wondering
doubts
a
rush
of
tenderness
filled
him
at
one
sweep
head
and
heart
to
the
core
molly
he
cried
panting
and
then
with
halting
voice
as
she
advanced
a
pace
and
stood
with
mouth
parted
and
brilliant
expectant
eyes
you
took
away
all
light
and
warmth
with
you
when
you
left
my
lonely
dwelling
i
tried
to
take
up
my
life
there
but
but
you
have
come
backfor
me
and
drawn
by
his
extended
hands
she
advanced
her
burning
gaze
fixed
upon
his
i
dared
not
think
of
seeing
you
again
he
murmured
clasping
her
hands
yet
my
return

pleases
you
yes
thus
was
crowned
this
strange
wooing
was
clenched
a
lifes
union
based
upon
either
side
on
fascinating
unrealities
she
was
drawn
into
his
arms
and
against
his
heart
she
lay
shaking
with
little
shivers
of
delight
looking
into
the
noble
face
bent
so
lovingly
over
hers
her
mind
floating
between
unconscious
exultation
and
languorous
joy
for
a
long
while
without
a
word
he
held
her
thus
on
his
strong
arm
gazing
with
a
rending
conflict
of
rapture
and
anguish
on
the
beautiful
image
of
his
lifes
love
until
his
eyes
were
dimmed
with
rising
tears
then
he
slowly
stooped
over
the
upturned
face
and
as
she
dropped
her
lids
with
a
faint
smile
kissed
her
lips
there
came
a
warning
rattle
at
the
door
handle
and
molly
disengaging
herself
softly
from
her
betrotheds
embrace
but
still
retaining
his
arm
turned
to
witness
the
entrance
of
miss
odonoghue
and
mr
landale
on
the
formers
face
under
a
feigned
expression
of
surprise
now
expanded
itself
in
effulgence
the
plenitude
of
that
satisfaction
which
had
been
dawning
there
ever
since
her
return
from
the
island
rupert
held
himself
well
in
hand
he
halted
it
is
true
for
an
instant
at
the
first
sight
of
sir
adrian
and
molly
and
put
his
handkerchief
furtively
to
his
forehead
to
wipe
the
sudden
cold
sweat
which
broke
out
upon
it
but
the
hesitation
was
so
momentary
as
to
pass
unperceived
and
if
his
countenance
as
he
advanced
again
bore
an
expression
of
disapproval
it
was
at
once
dignified
and
restrained
so
you
are
there
molly
exclaimed
the
old
lady
with
inimitable
airiness
just
imagine
my
dear
i
had
those
letters
in
my
pocket
all
the
while
after
all
you
did
not
find
them
did
you
but
adrian
still
retaining
the
little
hand
on
his
arm
came
forward
slowly
and
broke
through
the
incipient
flow
aunt
rose
said
he
in
a
voice
still
veiled
by
emotion
i
know
your
kind
heart
will
rejoice
with
me
although
you
may
not
be
so
surprised
as
no
doubt
rupert
will
be
at
the
news
we
have
for
you
molly
and
i
you
are
right
adrian
interrupted
rupert
gravely
to
any
who
know
your
life
and
your
past
as
i
do
the
news
you
seem
to
have
for
us
must
seem
strange
indeed
so
strange
that
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
withhold
congratulations
for
if
i
mistake
not
he
added
with
a
delicately
shaded
change
of
tone
to
sympathetic
courtesy
and
slightly
turning
his
handsome
face
towards
molly
i
assume
that
my
fair
cousin
de
savenaye
has
even
but
now
promised
to
be
my
sister
lady
landale
sir
adrian
who
softened
by
the
emotion
of
this
wonderful
hour
had
made
a
movement
to
grasp
his
brothers
hand
but
had
checked
himself
with
a
passionate
movement
of
anger
instantly
restrained
as
the
overt
impertinence
of
the
first
words
fell
on
his
ears
here
looked
with
a
shadowing
anxiety
at
the
girls
face
but
molly
who
could
never
withhold
the
lash
of
her
tongue
when
rupert
gave
the
slightest
opening
immediately
acknowledged
her
enemys
courtly
bow
with
sauciness
what
no
congratulations
from
the
model
brother
not
even
a
word
of
thanks
to
molly
de
savenaye
for
bringing
the
truant
to
his
home
at
last
but
you
malign
yourself
my
dear
rupert
i
believe
tis
but
excess
of
joy
that
ties
your
tongue
with
gleaming
smile
mr
landale
would
have
opposed
this
direct
thrust
by
some
parry
of
polished
insult
but
he
met
his
elders
commanding
glance
remembered
his
parting
words
on
two
previous
occasions
and
wisely
abstained
contenting
himself
with
another
slight
bow
and
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
the
shoulders
at
the
same
time
miss
odonoghue
with
an
odd
mixture
of
farcically
pretended
astonishment
and
genuine
triumph
fell
on
the
girls
neck
it
is
possible
soul
of
my
heart
my
sweet
childi
cant
believe
itthough
i
vow
i
knew
it
all
along
so
i
am
to
see
my
two
favourites
made
one
by
holy
matrimony
punctuating
her
exclamation
with
kisses
on
the
fair
young
face
and
wildly
seeking
in
space
with
her
driedup
old
fingers
to
meet
adrians
hand
i
the
one
barren
stock
of
the
odonoghues
shall
see
my
sisters
children
reunited
ah
adrian
what
a
beautiful
coat
this
will
make
for
you
to
hand
to
your
children
odonoghue
landale
kermelgan
savenayeeighteen
quarters
with
this
heiress
alone
adrian
child
for
the
descendants
of
landale
of
pulwick
and
miss
odonoghue
overcome
by
this
culminating
vision
of
happiness
and
perfection
fairly
burst
into
tears
in
the
midst
of
this
scene
mr
landale
after
listening
mockingly
for
a
few
instants
retired
with
ostentatious
discretion
later
in
the
day
as
madeleine
bent
her
pretty
ears
dutifully
yet
with
wandering
attention
to
mollys
gay
prognostications
concerning
pulwick
under
her
sway
whilst
the
servants
in
the
hall
pantry
and
kitchen
discussed
the
great
news
which
by
some
incomprehensible
agency
spread
with
torrentlike
swiftness
through
the
whole
estate
while
miss
odonoghue
was
feverishly
busy
with
the
correspondence
which
was
to
disseminate
far
and
wide
the
worlds
knowledge
of
the
happy
betrothal
sir
adrian
met
his
brother
walking
meditatively
along
the
winding
path
of
the
garden
flicking
with
the
loop
of
his
crop
the
border
of
evergreens
as
he
went
from
their
room
molly
and
madeleine
ensconced
in
the
deep
windowseat
could
see
the
meeting
how
i
should
like
to
hear
said
molly
i
know
this
supple
wretch
will
be
full
of
adrians
folly
in
marrying
mefirst
because
from
the
rupertian
point
of
view
it
is
a
disastrous
thing
that
his
elder
should
marry
at
all
and
secondly
because
molly
mistress
at
pulwick
priory
means
a
very
queer
position
indeed
for
mr
rupert
landale
how
i
wish
my
spirit
could
fly
into
adrians
head
just
for
a
moment
adrian
is
too
indulgent
it
requires
a
molly
to
deal
with
such
impertinence
indeed
you
are
unjust
with
our
cousin
said
madeleine
gently
why
this
hatred
i
cannot
understand
no
of
course
not
madeleine
rupert
is
charmingwith
you
i
am
not
blind
but
take
care
he
does
not
find
out
your
secret
miss
oh
i
dont
ask
you
any
more
about
it
but
if
he
ever
doesgare
ma
chre
but
at
the
present
juncture
mollys
estimate
of
sir
adrians
mood
was
mistaken
his
love
of
peace
which
amounted
to
a
wellknown
weakness
where
he
alone
was
concerned
weighed
not
a
feather
in
the
balance
when
such
an
interest
as
that
now
engaged
was
at
stake
as
a
matter
of
fact
rupert
landale
was
to
be
taken
by
surprise
again
that
day
and
again
not
pleasantly
on
noticing
his
brothers
approach
he
stopped
his
angry
flickings
and
slowly
moved
to
meet
him
at
first
they
walked
side
by
side
in
silence
presently
sir
adrian
began
rupert
he
said
gravely
after
our
first
interview
today
it
was
my
intention
to
have
begged
your
pardon
for
a
certain
roughness
in
my
manner
which
i
should
have
controlled
and
which
you
resented
i
would
have
done
so
had
you
allowed
me
at
that
moment
when
i
announced
my
forthcoming
marriage
and
my
heart
was
full
of
goodwill
to
all
especially
to
you
now
on
the
contrary
to
reestablish
at
least
that
outward
harmony
without
which
life
in
common
would
be
impossible
i
expect
from
you
some
expression
of
regret
for
your
behaviour
the
first
part
of
his
brothers
say
was
so
well
in
accordance
with
his
more
habitual
mood
that
mr
landale
had
already
sketched
his
equally
habitual
deprecating
smile
but
the
conclusion
changed
the
entire
standpoint
of
their
relations
an
expression
of
regretfrom
me
cried
he
exaggerating
his
astonishment
almost
to
mockery
from
any
one
but
my
brother
said
adrian
with
a
slight
but
perceptible
hardening
in
his
tone
i
should
say
an
apology
for
an
impertinence
mr
landale
now
genuinely
taken
aback
turned
a
little
pale
and
halted
abruptly
adrian
adrian
he
retorted
quickly
this
is
one
of
your
mad
moments
i
do
not
understand
no
brother
i
am
not
mad
and
never
have
been
dearly
as
you
would
wish
me
to
be
so
in
realitysince
death
would
have
none
of
me
but
though
you
know
this
yourself
but
too
well
you
have
never
understood
me
really
now
listenonce
for
all
try
and
see
our
positions
as
they
are
perhaps
then
matters
will
go
more
pleasantly
in
the
future
for
you
as
well
as
for
me
mr
landale
looked
keenly
at
the
speakers
face
for
a
second
and
then
without
a
word
resumed
his
walk
while
sir
adrian
by
his
side
pursued
with
quiet
emphasis
when
i
returned
from
the
other
world
so
to
speak
at
least
from
your
point
of
view
one
which
i
fully
understood
i
found
that
this
very
return
was
nothing
short
of
a
calamity
for
all
that
remained
of
my
kin
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
reduce
that
misfortune
to
a
great
extent
you
loved
the
positionthat
worldly
estimation
that
fortune
all
those
circumstances
which
with
perfect
moral
right
you
had
hitherto
enjoyed
they
presented
little
attraction
to
me
moreover
there
were
many
reasons
which
i
am
quite
aware
you
know
that
made
this
very
house
of
mine
a
dismal
dwelling
for
me
you
see
i
have
no
wish
to
give
too
generous
a
colour
to
my
motives
too
selfdenying
a
character
to
the
benefits
i
conferred
upon
you
but
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
they
were
benefits
for
them
i
received
no
gratitude
but
as
i
did
not
expect
gratitude
it
matters
little
i
might
however
have
expected
at
least
that
you
should
be
neutral
not
directly
hostile
to
mepray
let
me
finish
in
anticipation
of
a
rising
interruption
from
his
companion
i
shall
soon
have
done
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
not
merely
recriminating
hostile
you
have
been
and
are
now
so
long
as
the
position
you
assumed
towards
me
only
bore
on
our
own
relations
i
acquiesced
you
had
so
much
more
to
lose
than
i
could
gain
by
resenting
your
hidden
antagonism
i
held
you
so
to
speak
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
i
could
afford
to
pass
over
it
all
moreover
i
had
chosen
my
own
path
which
was
nothing
if
not
peaceful
i
say
you
always
were
hostile
to
me
you
have
been
so
more
than
ever
since
the
arrival
of
ccile

children
you
were
however
grievously
mistaken
if
you
thoughti
verily
believe
you
didthat
i
did
not
realise
the
true
motives
that
prompted
you
to
keep
me
away
from
themi
loved
them
as
their
mothers
children
i
love
molly
with
a
sort
of
love
i
myself
do
not
understand
but
deep
enough
for
all
its
strangeness
yet
i
submitted
to
your
reasoning
to
your
plausible
representations
of
the
disastrous
effects
of
my
presence
i
went
back
to
my
solitude
because
it
never
entered
my
mind
that
it
could
be
in
my
power
to
help
their
happiness
you
indeed
had
actually
persuaded
me
of
the
contrary
as
you
know
and
i
myself
thought
it
better
to
break
the
unfortunate
spell
that
was
cast
on
me
unfortunate
i
thought
it
but
it
has
proved
far
otherwise
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
alley
and
as
they
turned
back
facing
each
other
for
a
moment
sir
adrian
noticed
the
evil
smile
playing
upon
his
brothers
lips
it
has
proved
otherwise
he
repeated
how
i
came
to
change
my
views
i
daresay
you
have
guessed
for
you
have
of
late
kept
a
good
watch
on
your
mad
brother
rupert
at
any
rate
you
know
what
has
come
to
pass
now
i
desire
you
to
understand
this
clearlyinterference
with
me
as
matters
stand
means
interference
with
molly
and
as
such
i
must
and
shall
resent
it
well
adrian
and
what
have
i
done
now
was
mr
landales
quiet
reply
he
turned
a
gravely
attentive
innocently
injured
countenance
to
the
paling
light
when
i
said
you
did
not
understand
me
returned
sir
adrian
with
undiminished
firmness
when
i
said
you
owed
me
some
expression
of
regret
it
was
to
warn
you
never
again
to
assume
the
tone
of
insinuation
and
sarcasm
to
me
which
you
permitted
yourself
today
in
the
presence
of
molly
you
could
not
restrain
this
long
habit
of
censuring
of
unwarrantable
and
impertinent
criticism
of
your
elder
and
when
you
referred
to
my
past
molly
could
not
but
be
offended
by
the
mockery
of
your
tones
moreover
you
took
upon
yourself
if
i
have
heard
aright
to
disapprove
openly
of
our
marriage
upon
what
ground
that
would
bear
announcing
i
know
not
but
let
this
be
enough
try
and
realise
that
our
respective
positions
are
totally
changed
by
this
unforeseen
event
and
that
as
molly
is
now
to
be
mistress
at
pulwick
i
must
of
course
revoke
my
tacit
abdication
nevertheless
if
you
think
you
can
put
up
with
the
new
state
of
things
there
need
be
little
alteration
in
your
present
mode
of
life
my
dear
rupert
if
you
will
only
make
a
generous
effort
to
alter
your
line
of
conduct
and
here
sir
adrian
succumbing
for
a
moment
to
the
fault
so
common
to
kindly
minds
of
discounting
the
virtue
of
occasional
firmness
by
a
sudden
return
to
geniality
offered
his
hand
in
token
of
peace
mr
landale
took
it
his
grasp
however
was
limp
and
cold
i
am
quite
ready
to
express
regret
he
said
in
a
toneless
voice
since
that
would
seem
to
be
gratification
to
you
and
moreover
seems
to
be
the
tacit
condition
on
which
you
will
refrain
from
turning
me
out
i
ought
indeed
to
have
abstained
from
referring
however
vaguely
to
past
events
for
the
plain
reason
that
anything
i
could
say
would
already
have
come
too
late
to
prevent
the
grievous
deed
you
have
now
pledged
yourself
to
commit
rupert
exclaimed
sir
adrian
stepping
back
a
pace
too
amazed
at
the
instant
for
indignation
now
in
your
turn
hear
me
adrian
continued
mr
landale
with
his
blackest
look
i
have
listened
to
your
summing
up
of
our
respective
cases
with
perfect
patience
notwithstanding
a
certain
assumption
of
superiority
whichallow
me
to
insist
on
thisis
somewhat
ridiculous
from
you
to
me
you
complain
of
my
misunderstanding
you
briefly
this
is
absurd
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
understand
you
better
than
you
do
yourself
on
the
other
hand
it
is
you
that
do
not
understand
me
i
have
no
wish
to
paraphrase
your
little
homily
of
two
minutes
ago
but
the
heads
of
my
refutation
are
inevitably
suggested
by
the
points
of
your
indictment
to
use
your
own
manner
of
speech
my
dear
adrian
i
have
no
wish
to
assume
injured
disinterestedness
when
speaking
of
my
doings
with
regard
to
you
and
your
belongings
and
especially
to
this
old
place
of
yours
of
our
family
you
have
only
to
look
and
see
for
yourself
mr
landale
made
a
wide
comprehensive
gesture
which
seemed
to
embrace
the
whole
of
the
noble
estate
the
admirably
kept
mansion
with
walls
now
flushed
in
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
the
orderly
maintenance
of
the
vast
grounds
the
prosperousness
of
its
dependenciesall
in
fact
that
the
brothers
could
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
body
from
where
they
stood
and
all
that
they
could
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
mind
alone
go
and
verify
whether
i
fulfilled
my
duty
with
respect
to
the
trust
which
was
yours
but
which
you
have
allowed
to
devolve
upon
my
shoulders
and
ask
yourself
whether
you
would
have
fulfilled
it
betterif
as
well
i
claim
no
more
than
this
recognition
for
as
you
pointed
out
the
position
carried
its
advantages
if
it
entailed
arduous
responsibility
too
it
was
my
hope
that
heirs
of
my
body
would
live
to
perpetuate
this
pridethis
work
of
mine
it
was
not
to
be
now
that
you
step
in
again
and
that
possibly
your
flesh
will
reap
the
benefits
i
have
laboured
to
produce
ask
yourself
adrian
whether
you
who
shirked
your
own
natural
duties
would
have
buckled
to
the
task
under
my
circumstancesdistrusted
by
your
brother
disliked
and
secretly
despised
by
all
your
dependants
who
reserved
all
their
love
and
admiration
for
the
real
master
oh
i
know
the
cant
phrase
although
he
chose
to
abandon
his
position
and
yield
himself
to
the
stream
of
his
own
inertness
the
real
master
who
in
the
end
can
find
no
better
description
for
these
years
of
faithful
service
than
hostility
and
ingratitude
sir
adrian
halted
a
pace
a
little
moved
by
the
speciousness
of
the
pleading
the
incidental
reference
to
that
one
grief
of
his
brothers
life
was
of
a
kind
which
could
never
fail
to
arouse
generous
sympathy
in
his
heart
but
mr
landale
had
not
come
to
the
critical
point
of
his
say
and
he
did
not
choose
to
allow
the
chapter
of
emotion
to
begin
just
yet
but
he
continued
pursuing
his
restless
walk
again
to
use
your
own
phraseology
i
am
not
merely
recriminating
i
too
wish
you
to
understand
me
it
would
be
useless
to
discuss
now
what
you
elect
to
call
my
hostility
in
past
days
i
had
to
keep
up
the
position
demanded
by
our
ancient
name
to
keep
it
up
amid
a
society
against
whose
every
tenet
almostevery
prejudice
you
may
call
themyou
chose
to
run
counter
my
antagonism
to
your
mode
of
acting
and
thinking
was
precisely
measured
by
your
own
against
the
world
in
which
the
landales
as
a
family
hold
a
stake
let
that
therefore
be
dismissed
and
let
us
come
at
once
to
the
special
hostility
you
complain
of
in
me
since
the
troublesome
arrival
of
aunt
rose
and
her
wards
as
the
very
thing
which
i
was
most
anxious
to
prevent
if
possible
has
after
all
come
to
pass
the
present
argument
may
seem
useless
but
you
have
courted
it
yourself
most
anxious
to
preventif
possible
repeated
sir
adrian
slowly
this
from
a
younger
brother
is
almost
cynical
rupert
cynical
retorted
mr
landale
with
a
furious
laugh
why
you
have
given
sound
to
the
very
word
i
would
in
anybody
elses
case
have
applied
to
a
behaviour
such
as
yours
is
it
possible
adrian
said
rupert
turning
to
look
his
brother
in
the
eyes
with
a
look
of
profound
malice
that
it
has
not
occurred
to
you
yet
that
cynical
will
be
the
verdict
the
world
will
pass
on
the
question
of
your
marriage
with
that
young
girl
sir
adrian
flushed
darkly
and
remained
silent
for
a
pace
or
two
then
with
a
puzzled
look
i
fail
to
understand
you
he
said
simply
i
am
no
longer
young
of
course
yet
in
years
i
am
not
preposterously
old
as
for
the
other
pointsname
and
fortune
but
rupert
interrupted
him
with
a
sharp
exclamation
which
betrayed
the
utmost
nervous
exasperation
pshaw
if
i
did
not
know
you
so
well
i
would
say
you
were
playing
at
candour
thisthis
unconventionality
of
yours
would
have
led
you
into
curious
pitfalls
adrian
had
you
been
obliged
to
live
in
the
world
my
hostility
has
saved
you
from
some
already
i
knowmore
is
the
pity
it
could
not
save
you
from
thisfor
it
passes
all
bounds
that
you
should
meditate
such
an
unnatural
act
upon
my
soul
in
the
most
natural
manner
in
the
world
one
must
be
an
adrian
landale
and
live
on
a
tower
for
the
best
part
of
ones
life
to
reach
such
a
pitch
ofunconventionality
let
us
call
it
for
gods
sake
exclaimed
sir
adrian
suddenly
losing
patience
what
are
you
driving
at
man
in
what
way
can
my
marriage
with
a
young
lady
who
inconceivable
as
it
may
be
has
found
something
to
love
in
me
in
what
way
i
say
can
it
be
accounted
cynical
i
am
not
subtle
enough
to
perceive
it
to
any
one
but
you
sneered
the
other
coming
to
his
climax
with
a
sort
of
cruel
deliberation
it
would
hardly
require
special
subtleness
to
perceive
that
for
the
man
of
mature
age
to
marry
the
daughter
after
having
in
the
days
of
his
youth
been
the
lover
of
the
mother
is
a
proceeding
the
very
idea
of
which
is
somewhat
revolting
in
the
average
individual
there
are
many
rous
in
st
james
who
would
shrink
before
it
yet
you
the
enlightened
philosopher
the
moralist
but
sir
adrian
breathing
quickly
laid
his
hand
heavily
on
his
brothers
shoulder
when
you
say
the
mothers
lover
rupert
he
said
in
a
contained
voice
which
was
as
ominous
of
storm
as
the
first
mutters
of
thunder
you
mean
that
i
loved
heryou
do
not
mean
to
insinuate
that
that
noble
woman
widowed
but
a
few
weeks
whose
whole
soul
was
filled
with
but
one
lofty
idea

of
duty
was
the
mistressthe
mistress
of
a
boy
barely
out
of
his
teens
rupert
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
insinuate
nothing
my
dear
adrian
i
think
nothing
all
this
is
ancient
history
which
after
all
has
long
concerned
only
you
you
know
best
what
occurred
in
the
old
days
and
of
course
a
man
of
honour
is
bound
to
deny
all
tales
affecting
a
ladys
virtue
even
you
i
fancy
would
condescend
so
far
but
nevertheless
reflect
how
this
marriage
will
rake
up
the
old
story
it
will
be
remembered
how
you
for
the
sake
of
remaining
by
ccile
de
savenayes
side
abandoned
your
home
to
fight
in
a
cause
that
did
not
concern
you
nay
more
turned
your
back
for
the
time
upon
those
advanced
social
theories
which
even
at
your
present
season
of
life
you
have
not
all
shaken
off
you
travelled
with
her
from
one
end
of

to
the
other

fellow
or
i
will
take
you
by
that
brazen
throat
of
yours
and
strangle
the
venomous
lie
once
for
all
and
then
with
keen
reproach
that
you
of
my
blood
of
hers
too
should
be
the
one
to
cast
such
a
stigma
on
her
memorythat
you
should
be
unable
even
to
understand
the
nature
of
our
intercourse
oh
shame
on
you
for
your
baseness
for
your
vulgar
low
suspiciousness
but
no
i
waste
my
breath
upon
you
you
do
not
believe
this
thing
you
have
outwitted
yourself
this
time
hear
me
now
if
anything
could
have
suggested
to
me
this
alliance
with
the
child
of
one
i
loved
so
madly
and
so
hopelessly
the
thought
that
such
dastardly
slander
could
ever
have
been
current
would
have
done
so
the
world
having
nothing
to
gain
by
the
belief
will
never
credit
that
sir
adrian
landale
would
marry
the
daughter
of
his
paramourhowever
his
own
brother
may
deem
to
his
advantage
to
seem
to
think
so
the
fact
of
molly
de
savenaye
becoming
lady
landale
would
alone
had
such
ill
rumours
indeed
been
current
in
the
past
dispel
the
ungenerous
legend
for
ever
there
were
a
few
moments
of
silence
while
sir
adrian
battled
in
the
tumult
of
his
indignation
for
selfcontrol
again
while
rupert
realising
that
he
had
outwitted
himself
indeed
bestowed
inward
curses
upon
most
of
his
relations
and
his
own
fate
the
elder
brother
resumed
at
length
with
a
faint
smile
and
so
you
see
even
if
you
had
spoken
out
in
time
it
would
have
been
of
little
avail
then
he
added
bitterly
i
have
received
a
wound
from
an
unforeseen
quarter
you
have
dealt
it
to
no
purpose
rupert
as
you
see

though
it
may
be
some
compensation
to
such
a
nature
as
yours
to
know
that
you
have
left
in
it
a
subtle
venom
the
sun
had
already
sunk
away
and
its
glow
behind
the
waters
had
faded
to
the
merest
tinge
in
the
cold
shadow
of
rising
night
the
two
men
advanced
silently
homewards
sir
adrians
soul
guided
by
the
invidious
words
had
flown
back
to
that
dead
year
the
central
point
of
his
existenceit
was
true
men
will
be
menin
that
very
house
yonder
he
had
betrayed
his
love
to
her
on
board
the
ship
that
took
them
away
and
by
the
camp
fire
on
the
eve
of
fight
he
had
pleaded
the
cause
of
his
passion
not
ignobly
indeed
with
no
thought
of
the
baseness
which
rupert
assigned
to
him
yet
with
a
selfish
disregard
of
her
position
of
his
own
grave
trust
and
it
was
with
a
glow
of
pride
in
the
ever
living
object
of
his
lifes
devotionof
gratitude
almostthat
he
recalled
the
noble
simplicity
with
which
the
woman
whom
he
had
just
heard
classed
among
the
everyday
sinners
of
society
had
without
one
grandiloquent
word
without
even
losing
her
womanly
softness
kept
her
lover
as
well
as
herself
in
the
path
of
her
lofty
idealtill
the
end
and
yet
she
did
love
him
at
the
last
awful
moment
sinking
into
the
very
jaws
of
death
the
secret
of
her
heart
had
escaped
her
and
nownow
her
beauty
and
something
of
her
own
life
and
soul
was
left
to
him
in
her
child
as
the
one
fit
object
on
which
to
devote
that
tenderness
which
time
could
not
change





after
a
while
from
the
darkness
by
his
side
came
the
voice
of
his
brother
again
in
altered
hardly
recognisable
accents
adrian
those
last
words
of
yours
were
severeunjust
i
do
not
deserve
such
interpretation
of
my
motives
is
it
my
fault
that
you
are
not
as
other
men
am
i
to
be
blamed
for
judging
you
by
the
ordinary
standard
but
you
have
convinced
me
you
were
as
chivalrous
as
ccile
was
pure
and
if
needs
be
believe
me
adrian
i
will
maintain
it
so
in
the
face
of
the
world
yes
i
misunderstood
youand
wounded
you
as
you
say
but
such
was
not
my
intention
forgive
me
they
had
come
to
the
door
sir
adrian
paused
there
was
a
rapid
revulsion
in
his
kindly
mind
at
the
extraordinary
sound
of
humble
words
from
his
brother
and
with
a
new
emotion
he
replied
taking
the
hand
that
with
wellacted
diffidence
seemed
to
seek
his
grasp
perhaps
we
have
both
something
to
forgive
each
other
i
fear
you
did
not
misjudge
me
so
much
as
you
misjudged
her
who
left
me
that
precious
legacy
but
believe
that
believe
it
as
you
have
just
now

rupert
the
mother
of
those
children

stooped
to
human
frailtyher
course
in
her
short
and
noble
life
was
as
bright
and
pure
as
the
light
of
day
without
another
word
the
two
brothers
shook
hands
and
reentered
their
home
sir
adrian
sought
miss
odonoghue
whom
he
now
found
in
converse
with
molly
and
with
a
grave
eagerness
that
put
the
culminating
touch
to
the
old
ladys
triumph
urged
the
early
celebration
of
his
nuptials
mr
landale
repaired
to
his
own
study
where
in
solitude
he
could
give
loose
rein
to
his
fury
of
disappointment
and
consider
as
carefully
as
he
might
in
the
circumstances
how
best
to
work
the
new
situation
to
his
own
advantage





even
on
that
day
that
had
been
filled
with
so
many
varied
and
poignant
emotions
for
him
through
the
dream
in
which
his
whole
being
seemed
to
float
sir
adrian
found
a
moment
to
think
of
the
humble
followers
whom
he
had
left
so
abruptly
on
the
island
and
of
the
pleasure
the
auspicious
news
would
bring
to
them
it
was
late
at
night
and
just
before
parting
with
the
guest
who
was
so
soon
to
be
mistress
under
his
roof
he
paused
on
the
stairs
before
a
window
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
bay
molly
drew
closer
and
leant
against
his
shoulder
and
thus
both
gazed
forth
silently
for
some
time
at
the
clear
distant
light
the
luminous
eye
calmly
watching
over
the
treacherous
sands
that
light
of
scartheyit
was
the
image
of
the
solitary
placid
life
to
which
he
had
bidden
adieu
for
ever
which
even
now
at
this
brief
interval
of
half
a
day
seemed
as
far
distant
as
the
years
of
despair
and
vicissitude
and
disgust
to
which
it
had
succeeded
a
man
can
feel
the
suddenly
revealed
charm
of
things
that
have
ceased
to
be
without
regretting
them
with
the
dear
young
head
that
he
loved
with
a
love
already
as
old
as
her
very
years
pressing
his
cheek
with
that
slender
hand
in
his
grasp
the
same
for
his
love
was
all
miracle
that
he
had
held
in
the
hotpulsed
days
of
oldhe
yet
felt
his
mind
wander
back
to
his
nest
of
dreams
he
thought
with
gratitude
of
ren
the
singleminded
faithful
familiar
of
old
margery
the
nurse
who
had
tended
cciles
children
as
well
as
her
young
master
thought
of
their
joy
when
they
should
hear
of
the
marvellous
knitting
together
into
the
web
of
his
fate
of
all
those
faroff
ties
in
full
harmony
with
such
fleeting
thoughts
came
mollys
words
at
length
breaking
the
silence
will
you
take
me
back
to
that
strange
old
place
of
yours
adrian
when
we
are
married
sir
adrian
kissed
her
forehead
and
would
you
not
fear
the
rough
wild
place
child
he
murmured
not
for
ever
i
mean
laughed
the
girl
for
then
my
mission
would
not
be
fulfilledwhich
was
to
make
of
adrian
sir
adrian
indeed
but
now
and
again
to
recall
those
lovely
days
whenwhen
you
were
so
distracted
for
the
love
of
murthering
moll
and
the
fear
lest
she
should
see
it
you
will
not
dismantle
those
queer
rooms
that
received
so
hospitably
the
limping
draggledtailed
guestthey
must
again
shelter
her
when
she
comes
as
proud
lady
landale
how
delicious
it
would
be
if
the
tempest
would
only
rage
again
and
the
seamew
shriek
and
the
caverns
roar
and
thunder
and
i
knew
you
were
as
happy
as
i
am
sure
to
be
all
shall
be
kept
up
even
as
you
left
it
answered
sir
adrian
moved
by
tender
emotion
to
be
made
glorious
again
by
the
light
of
your
youth
and
fairness
and
renny
shall
be
cook
again
and
maid
of
all
work
my
poor
renny
what
joy
when
he
hears
of
his
masters
happiness
and
all
through
the
child
of
his
beloved
mistress
but
he
will
have
to
spend
a
sobering
time
of
solitude
out
there
till
i
can
find
a
substitute
for
his
duties
you
are
very
much
attached
to
that
funny
little
retainer
adrian
said
molly
after
a
pause
to
no
man
alive
do
i
owe
so
much
with
no
one
have
i
had
through
life
so
much
in
common
came
the
grave
reply
then
returned
the
girl
you
would
thank
me
for
telling
you
of
the
means
of
making
the
good
mans
exile
less
heavy
until
you
take
him
back
with
you
no
doubt
there
was
a
tone
of
surprise
and
inquiry
in
his
voice
why
it
is
simple
enough
have
you
never
heard
of
his
admiration
for
moggie
mearson
our
maid
let
them
marry
they
will
make
a
good
pair
though
funny
what
you
never
knew
it
of
course
not
or
you
would
not
have
had
the
heart
to
keep
the
patient
lovers
apart
so
long
let
them
marry
my
lord
of
pulwick
it
will
complete
the
romance
of
the
persecuted
savenayes
of
brittany
and
their
helpful
friends
of
the
distant
north
musing
sir
adrian
fell
into
silence
the
faithful
foolish
heart
that
never
even
told
its
secret
desire
for
very
fear
of
being
helped
to
win
it
by
whom
happiness
and
love
were
held
to
be
too
dearly
bought
at
the
price
of
separation
from
the
lonely
exile
eh
bien
dreamer
cried
the
girl
gaily
thank
you
molly
said
sir
adrian
turning
to
her
with
shining
eyes
this
is
a
pretty
thought
a
good
thought
renny
will
indeed
doubly
bless
the
day
when
providence
sent
you
to
pulwick
and
so
the
following
morn
mr
renny
potter
was
summoned
to
hear
the
tidings
and
informed
of
the
benevolent
prospects
more
privately
concerning
his
own
life
was
bidden
to
thank
the
future
lady
landale
for
her
service
was
gently
rebuked
for
his
long
reticence
and
finally
dismissed
in
company
of
the
glowing
moggie
with
a
promise
that
his
nuptials
should
be
celebrated
at
the
same
time
as
those
of
the
lord
of
the
land
the
good
fellow
however
required
first
of
all
an
assurance
that
these
very
fine
plans
would
not
entail
any
interference
with
his
duties
to
his
master
before
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
pleased
at
his
fortunes
great
and
complex
then
was
his
joy
but
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
as
moggie
confessed
to
her
inquiring
mistress
that
night
when
he
had
returned
to
his
post
whether
the
pride
and
delight
in
his
masters
own
betrothal
was
not
uppermost
in
his
bubbling
spirits

before
jolly
hunting
heretical
parson
cochrane
to
cleave
to
adrian
landale
till
death
bid
you
part
brrwhat
ghastly
words
and
with
what
a
light
heart
i
said
them
tripped
them
out
ma
foi
as
gaily
as
goodmorning
or
goodnight
they
were
to
be
the
open
sesame
to
joys
untold
to
lands
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
to
romance
adventure
splendourand
what
have
they
brought
me
it
is
a
cold
day
sleeting
snowing
blowing
all
that
is
abominable
my
lord
and
master
has
ridden
off
despite
it
to
some
distant
farm
where
there
has
been
a
fire
the
good
sir
adrian
as
they
call
him
nowhe
is
that
but
oh
dear
methere
i
must
yawn
and
ill
say
no
more
on
this
head
at
present
for
i
want
to
think
and
work
my
wretched
problem
out
in
earnest
and
not
go
to
sleep
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
taken
heart
to
write
since
yonder
day
of
doom
and
god
knows
when
i
shall
have
heart
again
upon
such
an
afternoon
there
is
nothing
better
to
do
since
sir
adrian
would
have
none
of
my
companyhe
is
so
precious
of
me
that
he
fears
i
should
melt
like
sugar
in
the
wethe
never
guessed
that
it
was
just
because
of
the
storm
i
wished
the
ride
were
we
to
live
a
hundred
years
togetherwhich
god
forfendhe
would
never
understand
me
ah
lackaday
oh
misery
me
my
lady
you
are
wandering
come
back
to
business
what
then
has
marriage
brought
me
first
of
all
a
husband
that
is
to
say
another
person
a
man
who
has
the
right
to
meto
whom
i
myself
have
given
that
rightto
have
me
to
hold
me
as
it
runs
in
the
terrible
service
the
thunders
of
which
were
twice
rolled
out
upon
my
head
and
which
have
been
ringing
there
ever
since
and
i
molly
gave
of
my
own
free
will
that
best
and
most
blessed
of
all
gifts
my
own
free
will
away
i
am
surrounded
as
it
were
by
barriers
hemmed
in
bound
up
kept
in
leading
strings
i
mind
me
of
the
seagull
on
the
island
tis
all
in
the
most
loving
care
in
the
world
of
course
but
oh
the
oppression
of
it
i
must
hide
my
feelings
as
well
as
i
can
for
in
my
heart
i
would
not
grieve
that
good
man
that
excellent
man
that
pattern
of
kind
gentlemanoh
oh
ohit
will
outthat
dreary
man
that
dull
man
that
most
melancholy
of
all
men
who
sighs
more
than
he
smiles
and
i
warrant
of
the
two
his
sighs
are
the
more
cheerful
who
looks
at
his
beautiful
wife
as
if
he
saw
a
ghost
and
kisses
her
as
if
he
kissed
a
corpse
there
is
a
mate
for
molly
the
mate
she
chose
for
herself
so
much
for
the
husband
what
else
has
marriage
brought
her
briefly
i
will
capitulate
a
titlei
am
my
lady
for
three
days
it
sounded
prettily
in
my
ears
but
to
the
girl
who
refused
a
duchess
coronet
who
was
born
comtesseto
be
the
baronets
ladytanty
may
say
what
she
likes
of
the
age
of
creation
and
all
the
rest
of
itthat
advantage
cannot
weigh
heavy
in
the
balance
again
then
i
have
a
splendid
housewhich
is
my
prison
and
in
which
like
all
prisoners
i
have
not
the
right
to
choose
my
companyelse
would
sophia
and
rupert
still
be
here
they
are
going
i
am
told
occasionally
but
my
intimate
conviction
is
however
often
they
may
be
going
they
will
never
go
item
four
i
have
money
and
nothing
to
spend
it
onbut
the
poor
what
next
what
nextalas
i
look
and
i
find
nothing
this
is
all
that
marriage
has
brought
me
and
what
has
it
not
taken
from
me
my
delight
in
existence
my
independence
my
hopes
my
belief
in
the
future
my
belief
in
love
faith
hope
and
charity
in
fact
destroyed
at
one
fell
sweep
and
all
to
gratify
my
curiosity
as
to
a
romantic
mystery
my
vanity
as
to
my
own
powers
of
fascination
well
i
have
solved
the
mystery
and
behold
it
was
nothing
i
have
eaten
of
the
fruit
of
knowledge
and
it
is
tasteless
in
my
mouth
i
have
made
my
capture
with
my
little
bow
and
spear
and
i
am
as
embarrassed
of
my
captive
as
he
of
me
we
pull
at
the
chain
that
binds
us
together
nay
such
being
the
law
of
this
world
between
men
and
women
the
positions
are
reversed
my
captive
is
now
my
master
and
molly
is
the
slave
tanty
i
could
curse
thee
for
thy
officiousness
from
the
tip
of
thy
coal
black
wig
to
the
sole
of
thy
platter
shoebut
that
i
am
too
good
to
curse
thee
at
all
poor
book
of
my
life
that
i
was
so
eager
to
fill
in
that
was
to
have
held
a
narrative
all
thrilling
and
all
varied
now
will
i
set
forth
in
thee
my
failure
my
hopelessness
and
after
that
close
thee
for
ever
of
what
use
indeed
to
chronicle
when
there
is
nought
to
tell
but
flatness
chill
monotony
on
every
side
when
even
the
workings
of
my
soul
cannot
interest
me
to
follow
since
they
can
now
foreshadow
nothing
lead
to
nothing
but
fruitless
struggle
or
tame
resignation
i
discovered
my
mistakenot
the
whole
of
it
but
enough
to
give
me
a
dreadful
foreboding
of
its
hideousness
not
two
hours
after
the
nuptial
ceremony
adrian
had
borne
himself
up
to
that
with
the
romantic
mysterious
dignity
of
presence
that
first
caught
my
silly
fancy
behind
which
i
had
pictured
such
fascinating
depths
of
passionof
firealas
when
he
looked
at
me
it
was
with
that
air
of
wondering
almost
timid
affection
battling
with
i
know
not
what
flame
of
rapture
with
which
look
i
have
become
so
fatally
familiar
sincewithout
the
flame
of
rapture
be
it
understood
which
seems
to
have
rapidly
burnt
away
to
a
very
ash
of
grey
despondency
and
selfreproach
i
could
have
sworn
even
as
he
gave
me
his
arm
to
meet
and
receive
the
congratulations
of
our
guests
that
the
glow
upon
his
cheek
the
poise
of
his
head
denoted
the
pride
any
man
were
he
not
an
idiot
nor
a
brute
must
feel
in
presenting
his
bridesuch
a
brideto
the
world
then
we
went
in
to
the
great
dining
hall
where
the
wedding
feast
a
very
splendid
one
was
spread
all
the
gentlemen
looked
with
admiration
at
me
many
with
envy
at
adrian
i
knew
that
i
was
beautiful
in
my
fine
white
satin
with
my
veil
thrown
back
without
the
flattering
whispers
that
reached
me
now
and
again
but
these
were
sweet
to
hear
nevertheless
i
knew
myself
the
centre
of
all
eyes
and
it
elated
me
so
too
did
the
tingling
flavour
of
the
one
glass
of
sparkling
wine
i
drank
to
my
fortunes
immediately
upon
this
silent
toast
of
lady
landale
to
herself
rupert
rose
and
in
choice
words
and
silverringing
voice
proposed
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
there
was
a
merry
bustling
pause
while
the
glasses
were
filled
then
rising
to
their
feet
as
with
one
man
all
the
gentlemen
stood
with
brimming
goblets
one
instant
extended
the
next
emptied
to
the
last
drop
and
then
the
cheers
rang
out
swelling
up
the
rafters
three
times
three
seeming
to
carry
my
soul
along
with
them
i
felt
my
heart
expand
and
throb
with
an
emotion
i
never
knew
in
it
before
which
seemed
to
promise
vast
future
capacities
of
pain
and
delight
i
turned
to
my
husband
instinctively
looking
for
expecting
i
could
not
explain
why
an
answering
fire
in
his
eyes
this
was
the
last
moment
of
my
illusions
from
thence
they
began
to
shrivel
away
with
a
terrifying
rapidity
adrian
sat
with
a
face
that
looked
old
and
lined
and
grey
with
haggard
unseeing
eyes
gazing
forth
into
space
as
though
fixing
some
invisible
and
spectre
show
he
seemed
as
if
wrapt
in
a
world
of
his
own
to
which
none
of
us
had
entrance
least
of
all
i
his
wife
the
shouts
around
us
died
away
there
were
cries
upon
him
for
speechspeech
then
playful
querieshow
is
this
sir
adrian
so
bashful
egad
next
nudges
were
exchanged
looks
of
wonder
and
an
old
voice
speaking
broadly
yes
by
george
it
was
saying
i
remember
it
well
by
george
in
this
very
room
now
twenty
years
ago
here
gentlemen
says
old
sir
tummas
heres
to
madam
de
savenaye
and
gad
maam
we
all
yelledshe
was
a
lovely
creatureeheh
hush
said
some
one
and
there
was
a
running
circle
of
frowns
and
the
old
voice
ceased
as
abruptly
as
if
its
owner
had
been
seized
by
the
weasand
in
the
heavy
embarrassed
silence
i
caught
tantys
red
perturbed
look
and
ruperts
smile
but
adrian
sat
onlike
a
ghost
among
the
living
or
a
live
man
among
the
dead
and
this
was
my
gallant
bridegroom
i
seized
him
by
the
handare
you
ill
adrian
he
started
and
looked
round
at
meoh
that
look
it
seemed
to
burn
into
my
soul
i
shall
never
forget
the
hopelessness
the
dull
sadness
of
it
and
theni
dont
know
what
he
read
in
my
answering
glancethe
mute
agonised
question
followed
by
a
terror
they
want
you
to
speak
i
whispered
and
shook
the
cold
hand
i
held
in
a
fury
of
impatience
his
lips
trembled
he
stared
at
me
blankly
my
god
my
god
what
have
i
done
he
muttered
to
himself
cciles
childcciles
child
i
could
have
burst
out
sobbing
but
seeing
ruperts
face
bent
down
towards
his
plate
demure
and
solemn
yet
stamped
for
all
his
cleverness
with
an
almost
devilish
triumph
my
pride
rose
and
my
courage
every
one
else
seemed
to
be
looking
towards
us
i
stood
up
good
friends
i
said
i
see
that
my
husband
is
so
much
touched
by
the
welcome
that
you
are
giving
his
bride
the
welcome
that
you
are
giving
him
after
his
long
exile
from
his
house
that
he
is
quite
unable
to
answer
you
as
he
would
wish
but
lest
you
should
misunderstand
this
silence
of
his
i
am
bold
enough
to
answer
you
in
his
name
andsince
it
is
but
a
few
moments
ago
that
you
have
seen
us
made
one
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
do
so
we
thank
you
my
heart
was
beating
to
suffocationbut
i
carried
bravely
on
till
i
was
drowned
in
a
storm
of
acclamations
to
which
the
first
cheers
were
as
nothing
they
drank
my
health
again
and
again
i
heard
the
old
gentleman
of
the
indiscreet
voicei
have
learned
since
he
is
stone
deaf
and
i
daresay
he
flattered
himself
he
spoke
in
a
whisperproclaim
that
i
was
my
mother
all
over
again
begadso
had
she
spoken
to
them
twenty
years
ago
in
this
very
room
here
tanty
came
to
the
rescue
and
carried
me
off
i
dared
not
trust
myself
to
look
at
adrian
as
i
left
but
i
knew
that
he
followed
me
to
the
door
from
which
i
presumed
that
he
had
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
in
some
degree
since
that
day
we
have
been
like
two
who
walk
along
on
opposite
banks
of
a
widening
streamever
more
and
more
divided
i
have
told
no
one
of
my
despair
it
is
curious
but
little
wifely
as
i
feel
towards
him
there
is
something
in
me
that
keeps
me
back
from
the
disloyalty
of
discussing
my
husband
with
other
people
and
it
is
not
even
as
it
might
have
beenthis
is
what
maddens
me
we
are
always
at
cross
purposes
some
wilful
spirit
wakes
in
me
at
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
always
gentle
and
restrained
and
echoing
of
past
sadness
under
his
mild
tender
look
at
the
every
fresh
sign
of
his
perpetual
watchful
anxietyi
give
him
wayward
answers
frowning
greetings
sighs
pouts
i
feel
at
times
a
savage
desire
to
wound
to
anger
him
and
as
far
as
i
dare
venture
i
have
ventured
yet
could
not

has
bloomed
into
a
beauty
that
i

this
is
because
of
this
unknown
whom
she
loves
she
breathes
the

no

let

gives
me
a
great
surprised
reproachful
glance
as
of
a
petted
child
that
has
been
hurt

she
scarcely

she
would
only
stammer
the

her
hot

the

an
eventful
day
ruperts
behaviour
at
home
since
his
brothers
wedding
had
been
as
even
molly
was
bound
to
admit
to
herself
beyond
reproach
in
tactfulness
quiet
dignity
and
seeming
cheerfulness
he
abdicated
from
his
position
of
trust
at
once
and
without
the
smallest
reservation
wooed
madeleine
with
so
great
a
discretion
that
her
dreamy
eyes
saw
in
him
only
a
kind
relative
and
he
treated
his
sisterinlaw
for
all
her
freaks
of
bearing
to
him
with
a
perfect
gentleness
and
gentility
at
times
sir
adrian
would
watch
him
with
great
eyes
what
meant
this
change
the
guileless
philosopher
would
ask
himself
and
wonder
if
he
had
judged
his
brother
too
harshly
all
through
life
or
if
it
was
his
plain
speaking
in
their
last
quarrel
which
had
put
things
in
their
true
light
to
him
and
awakened
some
innate
generosity
of
feeling

for

nature

with
unaffected
regret
about
leaving

at
the

time
in
spite
of
mollys
curling
lip
giving
it
to
be
understood
that
his
removal
was
only
a
matter
of
time
for
the
ostensible
purpose
indeed
of
finding
himself
another
home
he
made
in
the
beginning
of
march
the
second
month
after
his
brothers
marriage
several
absences
which
lasted
a
couple
of
days
or
more
and
from
which
he
would
return
with
an
eager
sparkle
in
his
eye
almost
a
brightness
on
his
olive
cheek
to
sit
beside
madeleines
embroidery
frame
pulling
her
silks
and
snipping
with
her
scissors
and
talking
gaily
persistently
with
such
humour
and
colour
as
at
last
to
draw
that
young
ladys
attention
from
far
off
musings
to
his
words
with
smiles
and
laughter
meanwhile
molly
would
sit
unoccupied
brooding
watching
them
now
fiercely
from
under
her
black
brows
now
scornfully
now
abstractedly
the
while
she
nibbled
at
her
delicate
fingernails
or
ruthlessly
dragged
them
along
the
velvet
arms
of
her
chair
with
the
gesture
of
a
charming
yet
distracted
cat
sir
adrian
would
first
tramp
the
rooms
with
unwitting
restlessness
halting
it
might
be
beside
his
wife
to
strive
to
engage
her
into
speech
with
him
and
failing
would
betake
himself
at
length
with
a
heavy
sigh
to
solitude
or
yet
he
would
sit
down
to
his
organthe
new
one
in
the
great
hall
which
had
been
put
up
since
his
marriage
at
mollys
own
gay
suggestion
during
their
brief
betrothaland
music
would
peal
out
upon
them
till
lady
landales
stormy
heart
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
she
would
rise
in
her
turn
fly
to
the
shelter
of
her
room
and
roll
her
head
in
the
pillows
to
stifle
the
sound
of
sobs
crying
from
the
depths
of
her
soul
against
heavens
injustice
anon
railing
in
a
frenzy
of
impotent
anger
against
the
musician
who
had
such
passion
in
him
and
gave
it
to
his
music
alone
during
ruperts
absences
that
curious
intimacy
which
molly
had
contemptuously
noted
between
her
sister
and
sisterinlaw
displayed
itself
in
more
conspicuous
manner
miss
landales
long
sallow
visage
sported
its
airs
of
mystery
and
importance
its
languishing
leers
undisguisedly
so
long
as
her
brother
ruperts
place
was
empty
and
though
her
visits
to
the
rectors
grave
were
now
almost
quotidian
she
departed
upon
them
with
looks
of
wrapt
importance
and
returning
sought
madeleines
chamber
when
that
maiden
did
not
herself
stroll
out
to
meet
her
in
the
woods
her
countenance
invariably
wreathed
with
suppressed
yet
triumphant
smiles
instead
of
the
old
selfassertive
dejection





the
15th
of
march
of
that
year
was
to
be
a
memorable
day
in
the
lives
of
so
many
of
those
who
then
either
dwelt
in
pulwick
or
had
dealings
on
that
wide
estate
miss
landale
who
had
passed
the
midnight
hour
in
poring
over
the
delightful
wickedness
of
lara
and
upon
at
length
retiring
to
her
pillow
had
had
a
sentimental
objection
to
shutting
out
the
romantic
light
of
the
moon
by
curtain
or
shutter
was
roused
into
wakefulness
soon
after
dawn
by
a
glorious
white
burst
of
early
sunshine
as
a
rule
the
excellent
soul
liked
to
lie
abed
till
the
last
available
moment
but
that
morning
she
was
up
with
the
sun
when
dressed
she
drew
a
letter
from
a
secret
casket
with
manifold
precautions
as
though
she
were
surrounded
with
prying
eyes
and
placing
it
in
her
reticule
hastened
forth
to
seek
the
little
lonely
disused
churchyard
by
the
shore
she
afterwards
remarked
that
she
could
never
forget
in
what
agitation
of
spirits
and
with
what
strange
presentiment
of
evil
she
was
led
to
this
activity
at
so
unwonted
an
hour
the
truth
was
however
that
miss
landale
tripped
along
through
the
damp
wooded
path
as
gaily
as
if
she
were
going
to
visit
her
living
lover
instead
of
his
granite
tomb
and
that
in
lieu
of
evil
omens
a
hundred
fantastically
sentimental
thoughts
floated
through
her
brain
as
merrily
and
irresponsibly
as
the
motes
in
the
long
shafts
of
brilliancy
that
cleaved
swordlike
through
the
mists
upon
her
from
out
the
east
visions
of
madeleines
face
when
she
would
learn
before
breakfast
that
sophia
had
actually
been
to
the
churchyard
already
visions
of
whom
she
might
meet
there
rehearsals
of
a
romantic
scene
upon
that
hallowed
spot
of
her
own
blushes
her
knowing
looks
her
playful
remonstrances
with
touching
allusions
to
one
who
had
loved
and
lost
herself
and
who
thus
c
c
miss
landale
tossed
her
long
faded
ringlets
quite
coquettishly
turned
one
slim
bony
hand
with
coy
gesture
before
her
approving
eyes
then
she
patted
her
reticule
and
hurried
on
with
fresh
zest
enjoying
the
tart
whisper
of
the
wind
against
her
well
bonneted
face
the
exquisite
virginal
beauty
of
the
earth
in
the
early
spring
of
the
day
and
of
the
year
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
trees
her
heart
leaped
and
then
almost
stood
still
as
she
perceived
in
the
churchyard
lying
below
her
beside
the
great
slab
of
granite
which
lay
over
the
remains
of
her
longdeparted
beloved
one
the
figure
of
a
man
whose
back
was
turned
towards
her
and
whose
erect
outline
was
darkly
silhouetted
against
the
low
dazzling
light
then
a
simper
of
exceeding
archness
crept
upon
miss
landales
lips
and
with
as
genteel
an
amble
as
the
somewhat
precipitate
nature
of
the
small
piece
of
ground
that
yet
divided
her
from
the
graveyard
would
allow
she
proceeded
on
her
way
at
the
click
of
the
lychgate
under
her
hand
the
man
turned
sharply
round
and
looked
at
her
without
moving
further
an
open
letter
fluttered
in
his
hand
his
face
was
still
against
the
light
and
miss
landales
eyes
had
wept
so
many
tears
by
day
and
night
that
her
sight
was
none
of
the
best
she
dropped
a
very
elegant
curtsey
simpered
drew
nearer
and
threw
a
fetching
glance
upwards
then
her
shrill
scream
rang
through
the
still
morning
air
and
frightened
the
birds
in
the
ruined
church
you
are
early
this
morning
sophia
said
mr
landale
sophia
sank
upon
the
tombstone
to
say
that
she
was
green
or
yellow
would
ill
describe
the
ghastliness
of
the
tint
that
suffused
her
naturally
bilious
countenance
still
speechless
she
made
a
frantic
plunge
towards
the
great
urn
that
adorned
the
head
of
the
grave
mr
landale
looked
up
from
his
reading
again
with
a
quiet
smile
i
shall
have
done
in
one
minute
he
remarked
it
is
a
fine
production
egad
full
of
noble
protestations
and
really
highsounding
words
and
then
my
dear
sophia
you
can
take
charge
of
it
and
i
shall
be
quite
ready
for
the
other
which
i
presume
you
have
as
usual
with
youah
in
your
bag
thanks
rupert
ejaculated
the
unfortunate
lady
first
in
agonised
query
and
next
in
agonised
reproach
clasping
her
hands
over
the
precious
reticulerupert
mr
landale
neatly
folded
the
sheet
he
had
been
reading
moistened
with
his
tongue
a
fresh
wafer
which
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
deftly
placing
it
upon
the
exact
spot
from
which
the
original
one
had
been
removed
handed
the
letter
to
his
sister
with
a
little
bow
but
as
with
a
gesture
of
horror
the
latter
refused
to
take
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
tossed
it
carelessly
into
the
urn
now
give
me
madeleines
he
said
peremptorily
rolling
upwards
eyes
of
appeal
the
unhappy
iris
called
upon
heaven
to
witness
that
she
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
betray
her
solemn
trust
but
even
as
she
spoke
the
fictitious
flame
of
courage
withered
away
in
her
shrinking
frame
and
at
the
mere
touch
of
her
brothers
finger
and
thumb
upon
her
wrist
the
mere
sight
of
his
face
bending
masterfully
over
her
with
white
teeth
just
gleaming
between
his
twisting
smile
and
halfveiled
eyes
of
insolent
determination
she
allowed
him
unresisting
to
take
the
bag
from
her
side
protesting
against
the
breach
of
faith
only
by
her
moans
and
the
inept
wringing
of
her
hands
mr
landale
opened
the
bag
tossed
with
cynical
contempt
upon
the
flat
tombstone
sundry
precious
relics
of
the
mouldering
bones
within
and
discovered
at
length
in
an
inner
pocket
a
dainty
flowerscented
note
then
he
flung
down
the
bag
and
proceeded
with
the
same
deliberation
to
open
the
letter
and
peruse
its
delicate
flowing
handwriting
upon
my
word
he
vowed
i
think
this
is
the
prettiest
she
has
written
yet
what
a
sweet
soul
it
is
listen
sophia
you
praise
me
for
my
trust
in
youbut
jack
dear
love
my
trust
is
so
much
a
part
of
my
love
that
the
one
would
not
exist
without
the
other
therefore
do
not
give
me
any
credit
for
you

i
could
not

loving
you
poor

confiding

ejaculated
mr
landale
as
if
to
himself
carefully
proceeding
the
while
with
his
former
manoeuvres
to
end
by
placing
the
violated
missive
to
all
appearance
intact
beside
its
fellow
we
have
here
a
rank
fellow
a
foul
traitor
to
deal
with
then
wheeling
round
to
his
sister
and
fixing
her
with
piercing
eyes

exclaimed
in
tones
of
sternest
rebuke

dark

already
filled
her
foolish
soul
with
blind
dread

sat
down
beside
her
and
once
more
enclosed
the
thin
arm
in
his
light

warning

he
said
solemnly

of
the
harm

have
been
doing
the
frightful
fate

have

depth
of
the
villainy

as
i
say
in
ignorance
without
realising
the
awful
consequences
of
your
folly
and
duplicity

that
you
should

such
illicit

reprehensible
behaviour

loved
you
by
the
stones
chosen

paid

her

that

so
gentlemanly
such
an

maundered
the

woman
between
her
chattering
teeth
it
was
quite
accidental
that
we
met
rupert
quite
accidental
i
assure
you
madeleinepoor
dear
girlcame
down
with
me
here
i
wanted
to
show
her
the
ggrave
here
sophia
gurgled
convulsively
remembering
her
brothers
cruel
reproaches
well
she
came
here
with
me
and
as
i
was
kneeling
down
planting
crocuses
just
here
rupert
and
she
was
standing
there
a
young
man
suddenly
leaped
over
the
wall
and
fell
at
her
feet
he
had
not
seen
mealas
it
reminded
me
of
my
own
happiness
and
he
was
so
welldressed
so
courteousand
seemed
such
a
perfect
gentlemanand
he
took
off
his
hat
so
gracefully
i
am
sure
i
never
could
have
believed
it
of
him
and
they
confided
in
me
and
i
promised
bybythose
sacred
ashes
to
keep
their
secret
i
remembered
of
course
what
tanty
had
said
in
her
letter
and
quite
understood
he
was
the
young
gentleman
in
questionbut
they
explained
to
me
how
she
was
under
a
wrong
impression
altogether
he
said
that
the
instant
he
laid
eyes
upon
me
he
saw
i
had
a
feeling
heart
and
he
knew
they
could
trust
me
he
spoke
so
nobly
rupert
and
said
what
better
place
could
they
have
for
their
meetings
than
one
consecrated
to
such
faithful
love
as
this
it
was
so
beautifuland
oh
dear
i
cant
but
think
there
is
some
mistake
and
miss
landale
again
wrung
her
hands
but
i
have
proof
thundered
her
brother
convincing
proof
of
what
i
have
told
you
at
this
very
moment
the
man
who
would
marry
madeleine
forsooth
runs
the
risk
of
imprisonmentnay
of
the
gallows
you
may
have
thought
it
strange
that
i
should
have
opened
and
read
letters
not
addressed
to
me
but
with
misfortune
hanging
over
a
beloved
object
i
did
not
pause
to
consider
myself
my
only
thought
was
to
save
her
here
mr
landale
looked
very
magnanimous
and
thrust
his
fingers
as
he
spoke
through
the
upper
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
with
the
gesture
which
traditionally
accompanies
such
sentiments
these
cheap
effects
proved
generally
irresistible
with
sophia
but
his
personality
had
paled
before
the
tremendous
drama
into
which
the
poor
romanceloving
soul
was
so
suddenly
plunged
and
in
which
in
spite
of
all
her
woe
she
found
an
awful
kind
of
fascination
failing
to
read
any
depth
of
admiration
in
her
roving
eye
rupert
promptly
abandoned
grandiloquence
and
resuming
his
usual
voice
and
manner
he
dropped
his
orders
upon
her
heat
of
agitation
like
a
cool
relentless
stream
under
which
her
last
protest
fizzed
sputtered
and
went
out
i
mean
to
unmask
the
gay
lover
at
my
own
time
and
in
my
own
way
never
fear
i
shall
deal
gently
with
her
you
will
now
take
this
letter
of
his
and
put
it
in
your
bag
leaving
hers
in
that
curious
postoffice
of
yours
yes
rupert
and
you
will
give
his
letter
to
her
at
once
when
you
go
in
without
one
word
of
having
met
me
y

yes
rupert
as
you
are
too
great
a
fool
to
be
trusted
if
you
once
begin
to
talk
you
will
have
a
headache
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
go
to
bed
in
a
dark
room
y

yes
rupert
you
will
moreover
swear
to
me
now
that
you
will
not
speak
of
our
interview
here
till
i
give
you
leave
say
i
swear
i
will
not
i
swear
i
will
not
so
help
me
god
oh
rupert
so
help
me
god
you
fool
sophias
lips
murmured
an
inaudible
something
but
there
was
such
complete
submission
in
every
line
and
curve
of
her
figure
in
the
very
droop
of
her
ringlets
and
the
helpless
appeal
of
her
gaze
that
rupert
was
satisfied
he
assisted
her
to
arise
from
her
tombstone
bundled
the
clerical
lovetokens
back
into
the
bag
duly
placed
captain
jacks
letter
in
the
inner
pocket
and
was
about
to
present
her
with
his
arm
to
conduct
her
homewards
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
little
ragged
urchin
peeping
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
seemingly
in
the
very
act
of
making
a
mysterious
signal
in
the
direction
of
miss
landales
unconscious
figure
rupert
stared
hard
at
the
ruddy
impudent
face
which
instantly
assumed
an
appearance
of
the
most
defiant
unconcern
while
its
owner
began
to
devote
his
energies
to
shying
stones
at
an
invisible
rook
upon
the
old
church
tower
with
great
nicety
of
aim
sophia
said
her
brother
in
a
low
tone
go
to
the
gate
that
boy
wants
to
speak
to
you
go
and
see
what
he
wants
and
return
to
me
miss
landale
gasped
gazed
at
her
brother
as
if
she
thought
him
mad
looked
round
at
the
little
boy
coloured
violently
then
meeting
ruperts
eye
again
staggered
off
without
a
word
of
protest
rupert
shaken
with
silent
laughter
humming
a
little
song
to
himself
stooped
to
pick
a
couple
of
tender
spring
flowers
from
the
border
beside
the
grave
and
after
slipping
them
into
a
buttonhole
of
his
many
caped
overcoat
stood
looking
out
over
the
stretch
of
land
and
sea
where
scarthey
rose
like
a
dream
against
the
sparkle
of
the
water
and
the
exquisite
blue
of
the
sky
presently
rapid
panting
breaths
and
a
shuffling
rustle
of
petticoats

your
little

thought
so
well

home
now
they
will
be
wondering
what
has
become

pray
take
my

then
beneath
his
breath
seeing
that
words
were
struggling
to
sophias
lips
hold
your
tongue
the
small
ragged
boy
watched
their
departure
with
a
derisive
grin
and
set
off
at
a
brisk
canter
down
to
the
shore
jingling
some
silver
coin
in
his
pocket
with
relish

he
went

the

in

terrible

trembled
but
as
he

the
day
morning
the
appointment
of
a
regular
lightkeeper
at
scarthey
intended
to
release
ren
and
old
margery
from
their
exile
had
been
delayed
so
as
to
suit
the
arrangement
which
was
to
leave
for
a
time
the
island
domain
of
sir
adrian
at
the
disposal
of
captain
jack
meanwhile
moggies
presence
greatly
mitigated
the
severity
of
her
husbands
separation
from
his
master
on
his
side
the
sailor
was
in
radiant
spirits
all
worked
as
he
could
wish
and
sir
adrians
marriage
besides
being
a
source
of
unselfish
satisfaction
was
with
regard
to
his
own
prospects
an
unexpected
help
for
his
expedition
concluded
he
would
now
be
able
in
the
most
natural
manner
to
make
his
appearance
at
pulwick
an
honoured
guest
of
the
master
under
the
pride
of
his
own
name
and
for
the
rest
hope
unfolded
warmcoloured
visions
indeed
during
the
weeks
which
had
elapsed
since
sir
adrians
departure
captain
jacks
visits
to
the
island
had
been
fitful
and
more
or
less
secrethe
always
came
and
left
at
night
but
as
it
was
understood
that
the
place
was
his
to
be
used
and
enjoyed
as
he
thought
best
neither
his
sudden
appearances
with
the
usual
heavy
travellingbag
nor
his
long
absences
excited
any
disturbance
in
the
arcadian
life
led
by
ren
between
his
buxom
young
wife
and
the
old
motheras
the
goodhumoured
husband
now
termed
the
scolding
dame
a
little
sleeping
closet
had
been
prepared
and
allotted
to
the
use
of
the
peripatetic
guest
in
one
of
the
disused
rooms
when
rens
own
accommodation
under
the
light
tower
had
been
enlarged
for
the
new
requirements
of
his
matrimonial
status
and
so
monsieur
the
captain
in
rens
inveterate
outlandish
phraseology
found
his
liberty
of
action
complete
both
the
womens
curiosity
was
allayed
and
all
tendency
to
prying
into
the
young
strangers
mysterious
purposes
amid
their
seclusion
condemned
beforehand
by
rens
statement
that
monsieur
the
captain
was
a
trusted
friend
of
the
masterone
indeed
and
here
the
informant
thought
fit
to
stretch
a
point
if
but
slightly
to
whom
the
lord
of
pulwick
was
indebted
in
bygone
days
for
life
and
freedom
except
when
weatherbound
a
state
of
things
which
at
that
time
of
year
occurred
not
unfrequently
ren
journeyed
daily
as
far
as
the
hall
ostensibly
to
report
progress
and
take
possible
orders
but
really
to
gratify
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
all
was
well
with
the
master
about
the
breakfast
hour
upon
this
15th
of
march
as
sir
adrian
was
discussing
with
the
bailiff
sundry
matters
of
importance
to
the
estate
a
tap
came
to
the
door
which
he
recognised
at
once
as
the
frenchmans
own
long
accustomed
mode
of
selfannouncement
since
he
had
assumed
the
reins
of
government
the
whilom
recluse
had
discovered
that
the
management
of
such
a
wide
property
was
indeed
no
sinecure
and
moreoveras
his
brother
who
certainly
understood
such
matters
in
a
thoroughly
practical
manner
had
warned
himthat
a
person
of
his
own
philosophical
overbenevolent
and
abstracted
turn
of
mind
was
singularly
illfitted
for
the
task
but
a
strong
sense
of
duty
and
a
determination
to
act
by
it
will
carry
a
man
a
long
way
he
had
little
time
for
dreaming
and
this
was
perhaps
a
providential
dispensation
for
sir
adrians
musings
had
now
lost
much
of
the
grave
placidity
born
of
his
long
peaceful
residence
in
his
thelema
of
scarthey
the
task
was
long
and
arduous
on
sundry
occasions
he
was
forced
to
consult
his
predecessor
on
the
arcana
of
landed
estate
government
which
he
did
with
much
simplicity
thereby
giving
mr
landale
not
only
inwardly
mocking
satisfaction
but
several
opportunities
for
the
display
of
his
selfeffacing
loyalty
and
superior
capacities
the
business
of
this
day
was
of
sufficiently
grave
moment
to
make
interruption
unwelcomebeing
nothing
less
than
requests
from
a
number
of
tenants
to
the
good
sir
adrian
the
real
master
come
to
his
own
againfor
a
substantial
reduction
of
rent
a
step
towards
which
the
masters
heart
inclined
but
which
his
sober
reason
condemned
as
preposterous
but
rens
countenance
as
he
entered
betrayed
news
of
such
import
that
sir
adrian
instantly
adjourned
the
matter
on
hand
and
when
the
bailiff
had
retired
anxiously
turned
to
the
newcomer
who
stood
in
the
doorway
mopping
his
steaming
brow
well
renny
said
he
what
is
wrong
nothing
about
your
wife
no
your
honour
answered
the
man
your
honour
is
very
good
nothing
wrong
with
our
moggie
but
the
captain
i
ran
all
the
way
from
the
shearmans
no
accident
there
i
hope
i
fear
there
is
your
honour
the
captainhe
has
been
attacked
this
morning
not
wounded
exclaimed
sir
adrian
not
dead
renny
oh
no
your
honour
well
but
he
has
i
fear
killed
one
of
the
men

the
revenue
men
then
seeing
his
master
start
aghast
he
went
on
rapidly
at
least
he
is
very
badbut
what
for
did
he
come
to
make
the
spy
upon
our
island
we
have
left
him
at
the
shearmansthe
mother
shearman
will
nurse
him
but
the
captain
your
honourthe
speaker
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
advanced
a
step
looking
roundthat
is
the
worst
of
all
the
captain
has
turned
mad
i
believeinstead
of
going
off
with
his
ship
and
his
crew
they
are
safe
out
to
sea
as
they
should
be
he
remains
at
scarthey
yesin
your
honours
rooms
he
is
walking
up
and
down
and
clutching
his
hair
and
talking
to
himself
like
a
possessed
and
when
i
respectfully
begged
him
to
consider
that
it
was
of
the
last
folly
his
having
rested
instead
of
saving
himself
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
reason
a
mule
and
so
knowing
that
your
honour
would
never
forgive
me
if
misfortune
arrived
i
never
drew
breath
till
i
reached
here
to
tell
you
if
his
honour
would
come
himself
he
might
be
able
to
make
mr
his
friend
hear
reasonyour
honour
will
run
no
risk
for
it
is
only
natural
that
you
should
go
to
the
peel
after
what
has
occurredbut
if
you
cannot
get
mr
the
captain
to
depart
this
night
there
will
arrive
to
us
misfortuneit
is
i
who
tell
you
so
i
will
go
back
with
you
at
once
said
sir
adrian
rising
much
perturbed
wait
here
while
i
speak
to
lady
landale
molly
was
standing
by
the
great
log
fire
in
the
hall
yawning
fit
to
dislocate
her
pretty
jaws
and
teasing
the
inert
form
of
old
jim
as
he
basked
before
the
flame
with
the
tip
of
her
pretty
foot
she
allowed
her
eyes
to
rest
vaguely
upon
her
husband
as
he
approached
but
neither
interrupted
her
idle
occupation
nor
endeavoured
to
suppress
the
yawn
that
again
distended
her
rosy
lips
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
laying
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
said
gently
my
child
i
am
called
back
to
scarthey
and
must
leave
instantly
youyou
will
be
careful
of
yourselfamuse
yourself
during
my
absenceit
may
be
for
two
or
three
days
lady
landale
raised
her
black
brows
with
a
fine
air
of
interrogation
and
then
gazed
down
at
the
old
dog
till
the
lashes
swept
her
cheek
while
a
mocking
dimple
just
peeped
from
the
corner
of
her
mouth
and
was
gone
again
oh
yes
she
answered
drily
i
shall
take
endless
care
of
myself
and
amuse
myself
wildly
you
need
have
no
fear
of
that
sir
adrian
sighed
and
his
hand
fell
listless
from
her
shoulder
goodbye
then
he
said
and
stooped
it
seemed
hesitatingly
to
lay
his
lips
between
the
little
dark
tendrils
of
hair
that
danced
upon
her
forehead
but
with
a
sudden
movement
she
twitched
her
face
away
despite
all
the
varied
delights
which
bind
me
to
pulwick
she
remarked
carelessly
the
charms
of
sophia
and
ruperts
company
and
all
the
other
amusementsi
have
a
fancy

we
need
not
waste
sentiment
upon
a
tender
parting
need
we
sir
adrians
cheek
flushed
and
with
a
sudden
light
in
his
eyes
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
but
his
countenance
faded
into
instant
melancholy
again
at
sight
of
her
curling
lip
and
cold
amused
gaze
will
you
not
have
me
she
asked
if
you
will
comeyou
will
be
welcomeas
welcome
his
voice
shook
a
little
as

must
always
be
wherever

ahoh
yawned
lady
landale
excuse
me

an

so
that
is
settled
i
hope
it
will
storm
tonight
that
the
wind
will
blow
and
howland
then
i
snuggle
in
the
feather

in
that
queer
old
room
and
try

fancy
i
am
happy
molly

savenaye
again
adrians
lip
quivered
yet
in
a
second
or
two
he
spoke
lightly
i
do
not
want
to
hurry
you
but
i
have
to
leave
at
once
then
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
by
that
longing
to
bring
pleasure
to
others
which
was
always
working
in
him
why
not
let
madeleine
come
with
you
too
he
asked
she
could
share
your
room
andit
would
be
a
pleasure
to
her
i
think
he
sighed
as
he
thought
of
the
trouble
in
store
for
the
lovers
lady
landale
grew
red
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
shot
a
look
of
withering
scorn
at
her
husbands
unconscious
face
it
would
be
charming
she
said
sarcastically
but
after
all
i
dont
know
that
i
care
to
go
so
muchoh
dont
stare
at
me
like
that
for
goodness
sake
a
woman
may
change
her
mind
i
supposeat

in
a
trifle
here
and
there
if

mon
dieu
i
have
a
husband
in
a
thousand
she
swept
him
a
splendid
curtsey
kissed
her
hand
at
him
and
then
burst
out
laughing
at
the
pale
bewilderment
of
his
face





when
sir
adrian
returned
to
the
morningroom
he
found
ren
half
hidden
behind
the
curtain
folds
peering
curiously
out
of
the
window
which
overlooked
the
avenue
on
his
masters
entrance
the
man
turned
his
head
placed
his
finger
on
his
lip
and
beckoned
him
to
approach
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
said
he
with
subdued
voice
will
his
honour
come
and
look
out
without
showing
himself
and
he
pointed
to
a
group
consisting
of
mr
landale
and
two
men
in
blue
jackets
and
cockaded
hats
of
seminaval
appearance
now
slowly
approaching
the
house
mr
landale
was
listening
with
bent
head
slightly
averted
to
the
smaller
of
his
two
companionsa
stout
squarelooking
fellow
who
spoke
with
evident
volubility
whilst
the
other
followed
defferentially
one
pace
in
rear
presently
the
trio
halted
a
few
yards
from
the
entrance
and
mr
landale
cutting
designs
upon
the
sand
with
the
end
of
his
stick
in
a
meditative
way
appeared
to
be
giving
directions
at
some
length
on
the
conclusion
of
which
the
two
men
touching
their
hats
with
much
respect
departed
together
while
the
magistrate
pensively
proceeded
on
his
way
to
the
house
those
your
honour
said
ren
were
with
him
that
was
struck
in
the
fight
this
morning
it
was
i
rowed
them
over
together
with
the
wounded
i
left
them
at
the
shearmans
and
slipped
away
myself
to
carry
the
news
if
i
might
take
upon
myself
to
advise
it
would
be
better
if
your
honour
would
come
with
me
now
at
once
for
fear
mr
landale
should
delay
us
by
questioning
memr
landale
being
a
magistrate
as
i
heard
these
men
say
and
moggie
has
assured
me
that
he
always
arranges
himself
for
knowing
when
i
arrive
from
the
islandever
since
the
day
when
the
demoiselles
had
just
come
and
i
found
it
out
ever
since
then
he
has
not
liked
me
mr
landale
come
away
your
honour
before
he
finds
out
i
have
been
here
today
following
upon
this
advice
which
he
found
to
the
point
sir
adrian
left
his
house
by
a
back
passage
and
through
a
side
garden
found
his
way
to
the
coast
and
to
the
fishing
village
the
wounded
man
who
had
not
recovered
consciousness
lay
in
the
brother
shearmans
hut
as
ren
had
said
surrounded
by
such
uncouth
attendance
as
the
rude
fisherfolk
could
dispense
after
giving
directions
for
the
summoning
of
medical
aid
and
the
removal
if
it
should
prove
advisable
of
the
patient
to
the
hall
but
without
a
single
comment
upon
the
unfortunate
occurrence
sir
adrian
then
took
the
road
of
the
peel
during
the
transit
walking
rapidly
by
his
masters
side
across
the
now
bare
causeway
ren
gave
his
account
of
events
the
captain
he
related
after
three
days
absence
had
reappeared
the
night
before
the
last
and
requested
him
to
warn
the
womankind
not
to
be
alarmed
if
they
heard
as
no
doubt
they
would
strange
noises
on
the
beach
at
night
he
was
said
he
storing
provisions
and
water
for
the
forthcoming
journey
and
the
water
in
the
well
was
so
excellent
that
he
had
determined
to
take
in
his
store
of
course
his
honour
understood
well
that
ren
did
not
concern
himself
in
these
matters
but
that
was
the
explanation
he
conveyed
to
his
wife
lest
she
should
be
alarmed
and
wonder
as
for
the
old
mother
she
was
too
deaf
to
be
awakened
out
of
sleep
by
anything
short
of
the
trumpet
of
the
last
judgment
as
announced
there
had
been
during
the
night
the
noise
of
a
party
of
men
landing
of
the
hoisting
and
rolling
of
barrelsa
great
remuemnage
altogetherand
the
next
morning
that
was
yesterday
the
captain
had
slept
sound
in
his
bunk
till
late
during
several
hours
of
the
following
day
he
had
some
secret
work
to
do
in
the
caves
of
which
ren
had
shown
the
ins
and
outs
and
whilst
so
engaged
had
requested
that
watch
should
be
kept
from
the
lighttower
and
message
sent
by
some
arranged
signal
should
any
one
approach
the
island
but
no
one
had
come
near
whilst
at
his
post
the
watcher
had
heard
at
different
times
the
sound
of
hammering
and
when
the
captain
had
come
to
relieve
him
the
good
gentleman
was
much
begrimed
with
dust
and
hot
with
work
but
appeared
in
excellent
humour
in
the
castle
he
sang
and
whistled
for
joyfulness
and
made
jokes
with
moggie
all
in
his
kind
way
saying
that
if
he
were
not
to
be
married
himself
soon
he
would
feel
quite
indignant
and
jealous
at
the
happiness
of
such
a
rascal
as
her
husband
oh
he
was
happymonsieur
the
captainhe
had
brought
moggie
a
beautiful
shawl
and
to
ren
he
had
given
a
splendid
watch
telling
him
to
keep
count
of
the
hours
of
his
unmerited
bliss
alas
this
morning
all
had
been
different
indeed
the
captain
looked
another
man
his
face
was
as
white
as
linen
the
very
look
of
him
would
have
told
any
one
that
a
misfortune
had
occurred
ren
did
not
quite
understand
it
himself
but
this
is
what
had
taken
place
the
captain
had
left
scarthey
on
foot
late
in
the
evening
and
when
he
returned
he
was
not
long
away
he
bade
ren
again
not
to
mind
what
he
heard
during
the
night
and
in
faith
once
more
there
had
been
a
real
noise
of
the
devil
men
coming
to
and
fro
a
deal
of
rowing
on
the
water
away
and
back
again
in
the
early
night
and
then
once
more
before
dawn
but
i
was
not
unquiet
said
ren
i
knew
they
had
come
for
the
remainder
of
what
mr
smith
was
pleased
to
call
his
provisions
from
our
room
i
could
see
by
the
light
on
the
stairs
that
the
lamp
was
burning
well
and
moggie
slept
like
a
child
so
sound
she
never
moved
just
before
the
rising
sun
i
had
got
up
and
put
out
the
lamp
and
was
going
to
bed
again
when
there
came
thumps
of
the
devil
at
the
lower
door
well
knowing
that
the
captain
had
his
own
way
of
enteringfor
he
had
spent
many
days
in
finding
out
all
sorts
of
droll
passages
in
the
ruinsi
was
quite
seized
and
as
i
hurried
down
the
thumps
came
again
and
great
cries
for
the
lighthousekeeper
and
your
honour
when
i
unbarred
the
door
there
was
a
man
in
uniform
whom
i
did
not
know
and
he
asked
me
grumbling
if
i
knew
of
the
pretty
doings
on
the
beach
whilst
i
slept
like
pig
he
saidof
course
i
made
the
astonished
as
his
honour
may
imagine
i
knew
nothing
had
heard
nothing
though
my
heart
was
beating
like
to
burst
not
knowing
what
was
coming
then
he
ordered
me
to
lend
a
hand
and
bring
a
ladder
to
carry
away
one
of
his
men
who
had
been
murdered
by
the
smugglers
he
said
and
there
on
the
sands
in
front
of
the
small
cave
was
another
man
in
a
blue
coat
too
watching
over
the
body
of
one
who
was
stretched
out
quite
tranquil
his
face
covered
with
blood
and
his
eyes
closed
they
are
gone
says
the
gross
man
and
i
was
glad
as
your
honour
may
well
think
to
see
the
chaloupe
full
of
the
captains
men
rowing
hard
towards
the
vessel
she
had
just
come
out
of
the
river
mouth
and
was
doubling
round
the
banks
we
carried
the
man
on
his
ladder
to
the
kitchen
and
we
and
the
women
did
all
we
could
but
he
remained
like
a
log
so
after
a
time
the
two
men
who
said
they
had
come
along
the
dyke
soon
after
midnight
on
foot
as
they
thought
it
would
be
more
secret
and
had
watched
all
night
in
the
bent
wanted
to
eat
and
drink
and
rest
they
had
missed
their
game
the
big
man
said
they
had
been
sent
to
find
out
what
sort
of
devils
tricks
were
being
played
on
in
the
island
unbeknown
to
sir
adrianbut
it
was
the
devils
luck
altogether
for
the
smugglers
had
slipped
away
and
would
not
be
seen
in
this
part
of
the
world
again
that
is
the
way
the
fat
man
spoke
the
other
had
nothing
to
say
but
swallowed
our
bacon
and
our
beer
as
if
he
did
not
care
and
then
your
honour
they
told
me
i
should
have
to
lend
them
the
yawl
to
go
on
land
and
go
myself
to
help
and
take
the
body
with
us
and
as
he
was
speaking
i
saw
moggie
the
wife
who
had
been
backwards
and
forwards
serving
them
looking
at
me
very
straight
but
without
blowing
a
word
as
if
she
had
fear
and
all
at
once
i
felt
there
was
something
on
foot
so
i
drew
the
men
more
beer
and
said
i
would
see
after
the
yawl
outside
the
door
the
wife
whispered
upstairs
quick
renny
and
she
herself
whisked
back
into
the
kitchen
so
that
she
should
not
cause
suspicion
to
those
othersah
your
honour
that
is
a
woman
well
well
interrupted
his
master
anxiously
well
i
went
upstairs
four
by
four
and
there
in
your
honours
room
without
an
attempt
to
conceal
himself
when
any
moment
it
might
have
entered
into
those
brigands
heads
downstairs
to
search
the
place
there
was
monsieur
the
captain
raging
up
and
down
like
a
wolf
in
cage
as
i
had
the
honour
to
describe
before
no
wonder
moggie
was
afraid
for
him
a
woman
is
quick
to
feel
danger
ahead
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
did
not
know
me
his
face
all
unmade
you
know
what
has
happened
he
says
am
i
not
the
most
unfortunate
all
is
lost
with
respect
says
i
nothing
is
lost
so
long
as
life
is
safe
but
it
is
not
a
good
thing
monsieur
the
captain
that
you
are
here
like
this
when
you
should
be
on
your
good
ship
as
many
miles
away
as
she
can
make
are
you
mad
to
him
i
say
and
he
to
me
i
think
i
am
at
least
let
me
hide
you
i
beg
of
him
i
know
of
many
beautiful
places
and
so
for
the
matter
of
that
does
he
but
it
was
all
lost
trouble
at
length
he
sits
down
at
the
table
and
begins
to
write
and
his
look
brightens
you
can
help
me
my
good
friend
he
says
i
have
a
hope
leftwho
knowswho
knowsand
he
writes
a
few
lines
like
an
enraged
and
folds
them
and
kisses
the
billet
find
means
says
he
ren
to
get
johnny
the
shearman
boy
to
take
this
to
the
old
churchyard
and
place
it
in
the
place
he
knows
of
or
better
still
should
he
chance
upon
miss
landale
to
give
it
to
her
he
is
a
sharp
rogue
says
he
and
i
can
trust
his
wits
but
should
you
not
find
him
dear
ren
you
must
do
the
commission
for
me
yourself
now
gogo
he
cries
and
pushes
me
to
the
stairs
and
as
i
dared
remain
no
more
i
had
to
leave
him
of
course
monsieur
the
captain
has
not
been
here
all
this
time
without
telling
me
of
his
hopes
and
it
is
clear
that
it
is
to
bid
farewell
to
mademoiselle
madeleine
that
he
is
playing
with
his
life
it
is
as
ill
reasoning
with
a
lover
as
a
lunatic
they
are
the
same
thing
ma
foi
but
i
trust
to
your
honour
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
if
any
one
can
and
so
to
continue
i
went
down
and
i
told
the
men
in
blue
the
boat
was
ready
we
carried
the
body
i
left
them
at
the
shearmans
as
your
honour
knows
i
found
johnny
and
gave
him
the
letter
he
knew
all
about
what
to
do
it
seemed
and
then
i
came
straight
to
the
hall
it
is
indeed
a
miserable
business
said
sir
adrian
ren
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
sympathy
as
he
noticed
the
increasing
concern
on
his
masters
face
you
heard
them
mention
my
brothers
name
inquired
the
latter
after
following
the
train
of
his
misgivings
for
a
few
moments
you
have
reason
to
think
that
mr
landale
knew
of
these
mens
errand
other
reason
i
mean
than
having
seen
them
with
him
just
now
rens
quick
mind
leaped
at
the
meaning
of
the
question
yes
your
honour
mr
landale
will
want
to
know
of
this
says
the
fat
one
though
it
is
too
late
he
says
and
ren
added
ruefully
i
have
great
fear
the
captain
is
not
at
the
end
of
his
pains
if
mr
landale
is
ranged
against
him
such
was
also
sir
adrians
thought
but
he
walked
on
for
a
time
in
silence
and
having
reached
scarthey
rapidly
made
his
way
into
the
peel
captain
jack
was
still
pacing
the
room
much
as
ren
had
described
when
sir
adrian
entered
upon
him
the
young
man
turned
with
a
transient
look
of
surprise
to
the
newcomer
then
waved
away
the
proffered
hand
with
a
bitter
smile
you
do
not
know
he
said
who
it
is
you
would
shake
hands
withan
outlawa
criminal
ah
you
have
heard
then
renny
i
suppose
has
told
you
yes
groaned
the
other
holding
his
friend
by
both
shoulders
and
gazing
sorrowfully
into
the
haggard
face
the
man
may
dieoh
jack
jack
how
could
you
be
so
rash
i
cant
say
how
it
all
happened
answered
captain
jack
falling
to
his
walk
to
and
fro
again
in
the
extremity
of
his
distress
and
ever
and
anon
mopping
his
brow
i
felt
such
security
in
this
place
all
was
loaded
but
the
last
barrel
when
all
of
a
sudden
from
god
knows
where
the
man
sprang
on
me
and
thrust
his
dark
lantern
in
my
face
it
is
smith
i
heard
him
say
i
do
believe
now
that
he
only
wanted
to
identify
me
no
man
in
his
senses
could
have
dared
to
try
and
arrest
me
surrounded
by
my
six
men
but
i
had
no
time
to
think
then
adrian
i
imagined
the
fellow
was
leading
a
general
attack
if
that
last
barrel
was
seized
the
whole
secret
was
out
and
that
meant
ruin
wholesale
failure
seemed
to
menace
me
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
my
success
i
had
a
handspike
in
my
hand
with
which
i
had
been
helping
to
roll
the
kegs
i
struck
with
it
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
man
went
down
on
the
spot
with
a
groan
as
he
fell
i
leaped
back
ready
for
the
next
i
called
out
stretchers
lads
they
want
to
take
your
captain
my
lads
gathered
round
me
at
once
but
there
was
silence
not
another
creature
to
be
seen
or
heard
they
set
to
work
to
get
that
last
blessed
bit
of
cargo
the
cause
of
all
the
misery
on
board
with
the
rest
while
i
stood
in
the
growing
dawn
looking
down
at
the
motionless
figure
and
at
the
blood
trickling
into
the
sand
trying
to
think
to
settle
what
to
do
and
only
conscious
of
one
thing
the
intense
wish
that
i
could
change
places
with
my
victim
can
you
wonder
adrian
that
my
brain
was
reeling
you
who
know
all
all
this
means
to
me
can
you
wonder
that
i
could
not
leave
this
shoreeven
though
my
life
depended
on
itwithout
seeing
her
again
curwen
my
mate
came
up
to
me
at
last
and
i
woke
up
to
some
sort
of
reason
at
the
idea
that
they
the
crew
and
the
ship
must
be
removed
from
the
immediate
danger
but
the
orders
i
gave
must
have
seemed
those
of
a
madman
i
told
him
to
sail
right
away
but
to
double
back
in
time
to
have
the
schooner
round
again
at
twelve
noon
today
and
then
to
send
the
gigs
crew
to
pick
me
up
on
pulwick
sand
life
and
death
said
i
to
him
and
he
brave
fellow
ay
ay
sir
as
if
it
was
the
most
simple
thing
in
the
world
and
off
with
him
without
another
word
what
imprudence
what
imprudence
murmured
sir
adrian
who
knows
none
will
believe
that
i
have
not
seized
the
opportunity
of
making
my
escape
with
the
others
the
height
of
imprudence
may
become
the
height
of
security
i
have
as
yet
no
planbut
it
will
come
my
luck
shall
not
fail
me
now
who
knows
nothing
perhaps
is
damaged
but
an
excise
mans
crown
thank
heaven
the
wind
cannot
fail
us
today
but
meanwhile
urged
sir
adrian
quite
unconvinced
highly
disturbed
that
treasure
on
board
i
know
what
has
been
your
motive
jack
but
indeed
it
is
all
nothing
short
of
insanity
positive
insanity
can
you
trust
your
men
i
would
trust
them
with
my
own
secrets
willingly
enough
but
not
with
those
of
other
people
so
they
do
not
know
what
i
have
in
those
barrels
four
thousand
golden
guineas
in
each
no
the
temptation
would
be
too
terrible
for
the
poor
lads
not
a
soul
knows
that
beyond
you
and
me
curwen
has
charge
of
the
cargo
such
as
it
is
but
i
can
answer
for
it
none
of
them
will
dream
of
tampering
with
the
casks
they
are
picked
men
sober
trusty
who
have
fought
side
by
side
with
me
i
am
their
best
friend
they
are
mine
body
and
soul
i
believe
they
do
know
there
is
some
risk
in
the
business
but
they
trust
me
they
are
sure
of
treble
pay
and
besides
are
not
troubled
with
squeamishness
as
for
curwen
he
would
go
to
hell
for
me
and
never
ask
a
question
no
adrian
the
scheme
was
perfect
but
for
this
cursed
blow
of
mine
this
morning
and
now
it
is
a
terrible
responsibility
continued
the
young
man
again
wiping
his
forehead
every
ounce
of
it
weighs
on
my
shoulders
but
it
is
not
that
that
distracts
me
oh
adrian

madeleine
the
elder
man
felt
his
heart
contract
at
the
utter
despairing
of
that
cry
when
my
handspike
crashed
on
that
damned
interferers
skull
the
sailor
went
on
i
felt
as
if
the
blow
had
opened
an
unfathomable
chasm
between
her
and
me
now
i
am
felonyes
in
law
a
felon
and
yet
i
am
the
same
man
as
yesterday
i
shall
have
to
fly
tonight
and
may
never
be
able
to
return
openly
to
england
again
all
my
golden
dreams
of
happiness
of
honour
vanished
at
the
sound
of
that
cursed
blow
but
i
must
see
her
adrian
i
must
see
her
before
i
go
i
am
going
to
meet
her
at
noon
in
the
ruins
of
pulwick
impossible
ejaculated
the
other
aghast
listen
jack
unfortunate
man
when
i
heard
of
thethe
misfortune
and
of
your
folly
in
remaining
i
instantly
planned
a
last
meeting
for
you
as
it
fell
out
my
wife
has
a
fancy
to
spend
the
night
here
i
have
asked
her
to
bring
her
sister
with
her
but
this
inconceivably
desperate
plan
of
leaving
in
your
ship
in
broad
light
of
day
frustrates
all
i
would
have
done
for
you
for
gods
sake
let
us
contrive
some
way
of
warning
the
peregrine
off
till
midnight
keep
hidden
yourself
do
not
wilfully
run
your
head
into
the
noose
but
the
young
man
had
stopped
short
in
his
tramping
and
stood
looking
at
his
friend
with
a
light
of
hope
flaming
in
his
eye
you
have
done
that
adrian
you
have
thought
of
that
he
repeated
as
if
mechanically
a
new
whirlwind
of
schemes
rushed
through
his
mind
for
a
while
he
remained
motionless
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
sir
adrian
putting
order
in
his
own
thoughts
with
that
genius
of
precision
and
swiftness
which
in
strong
natures
rises
to
meet
a
crisis
then
advancing
and
seizing
him
by
both
hands
adrian
he
cried
in
something
more
like
his
own
voice
again
i
shall
yet
owe
my
happiness
to
you
to
this
thought
this
sublime
thought
of
your
heart
and
as
sir
adrian
astounded
unable
to
understand
this
extremity
of
hopefulness
following
upon
the
previous
depth
of
misery
stared
back
at
him
speechless
the
latter
proceeded
in
still
more
surprising
fashion
now
you
listen
to
me
this
time
i
have
been
selfish
in
running
the
risk
of
having
you
mixed
up
in
my
dangerous
affairs
but
god
is
my
witness
i
acted
under
the
belief
that
all
was
absolutely
secure
now
however
you
must
do
nothing
more
that
might
implicate
you
remember
do
nothing
to
let
people
suspect
that
you
have
seen
me
today
renny
too
must
keep
close
counsel
you
know
nothing
of
my
future
movements
remain
here
for
a
while
do
not
even
look
out
of
the
window
i
fear
we
shall
not
meet
for
a
long
time
meanwhile
god
bless
yougod
bless
you
after
another
wrench
of
the
hands
he
held
in
his
the
sailor
released
them
and
fairly
ran
out
of
the
room
without
heeding
his
friends
bewildered
expostulations
at
the
door
of
the
keep
he
met
ren
again
and
after
a
brief
but
earnest
colloquy
the
man
whose
life
was
now
forfeit
to
the
community
and
upon
whose
head
there
would
soon
be
a
price
was
quietly
walking
along
the
causeway
making
for
the
shore
with
the
greatest
apparent
unconcern
and
deliberation
and
whilst
sir
adrian
alone
in
his
chamber
with
his
head
resting
upon
his
hand
anxiously
pondered
upon
the
possible
issues
of
this
nefarious
days
doings
the
sailor
advanced
in
broad
daylight
towards
the
land
to
keep
his
appointment





a
solitary
speck
of
life
upon
the
great
waste
with
the
consciousness
of
the
precarious
thread
of
chance
upon
which
it
hung
what
wonder
that
for
all
his
daring
the
traveller
felt
as
he
deliberately
regulated
his
pace
to
the
most
nonchalant
gait
a
frantic
desire
to
run
forward
or
to
lie
down
how
many
approach
glasses
might
now
be
laid
like
so
many
guns
upon
him
from
secret
points
of
the
coast
until
he
came
within
range
of
recognition
what
ambushes
those
clumps
of
gorse
and
juniper
those
plantations
of
alders
and
young
firs
on
the
bluffs
yonder
might
conceal
the
eye
could
reach
far
and
wide
upon
the
immense
stretch
of
sand
along
the
desert
coast
and
his
solitary
figure
moving
upon
the
yellow
strand
was
a
mark
for
miles
around
steadily
nevertheless
did
he
advance
the
very
daring
the
unpardonable
foolhardiness
of
the
deed
his
safety
and
yet
the
strain
was
high
were
they
watching
the
island
among
the
eager
crew
to
each
of
whom
the
capture
might
mean
a
splendid
prize
and
chance
of
promotion
was
there
one
would
have
the
genius
of
suddenly
suspecting
that
this
foolhardy
wayfarer
might
be
the
man
they
wanted
and
not
merely
sir
adrian
returning
on
foot
towards
his
home
and
then
came
the
answer
of
hopeful
youth
and
hardy
courage
no
the
preventive
are
a
lubberly
lotit
will
require
something
better
than
a
waterguard
to
track
and
take
lucky
jack
smith





but
for
all
his
assurance
lucky
jack
smith
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
he
felt
the
shadow
of
pulwick
woods
closing
around
him
at
last
chapter
xxiii
the
day
noon
there
stood
two
men
and
they
did
point
their
fingers
at
that
house
and
on
his
finger
one
had
blood
the
others
finger
shook
luteplayers
song
broken
lengths
of
wall
a
crumbling
indication
of
the
spring
of
once
exquisite
arches
windows
gaping
darkly
like
the
eye
sockets
of
a
skullthis
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
old
priory
of
pulwick
whilom
proud
seat
of
clerical
power
and
learning
but
the
image
of
decay
was
robbed
of
all
melancholy
by
the
luxuriance
of
climbing
vegetation
by
the
living
screen
of
noble
firs
and
larches
arranged
in
serried
ranks
upon
the
slopes
immediately
behind
it
with
here
and
there
a
rugged
sentinel
within
the
ruinous
yards
and
rooms
themselves
by
wild
bushes
of
juniper
and
gorse
and
brambles
and
with
the
bright
noon
sun
pouring
down
upon
the
worn
red
sandstone
and
gilding
the
delicate
tassels
of
the
larches
green
needles
with
the
light
of
young
love
spreading
glamour
upon
every
leaf
and
stone
in
the
eyes
of
the
lovers
the
scene
witness
of
so
many
sweet
meetings
bore
that
day
a
beautiful
and
homelike
aspect
captain
jack
was
standing
upon
the
grassgrown
floor
of
what
had
been
the
departed
monks
refectory
with
ears
eagerly
bent
to
listen
three
ragged
walls
a
clump
of
fir
trees
and
a
bank
of
brambles
screened
him
from
any
chance
passerby
and
he
now
and
again
peered
through
a
crevice
on
to
a
path
through
the
woods
cautiously
as
if
fearful
to
venture
forth
his
face
was
pale
beneath
its
tan
and
had
none
of
its
usual
brightness
his
attire
for
him
was
disordered
his
whole
appearance
that
of
a
man
under
the
pressure
of
doubt
and
anxiety
yet
when
the
sound
of
a
light
footfall
struck
among
the
thousand
whispering
noises
of
wind
and
leaf
that
went
to
make
up
the
silence
of
the
ruins
the
glory
of
joy
that
lit
up
eye
and
lip
left
no
room
for
any
other
impression
madeleine
stood
in
the
old
doorway
a
vision
of
beautiful
life
amid
emblems
of
decay
and
death
i
come
alone
today
she
said
with
her
halfshy
smile
and
then
before
she
could
utter
a
further
word
of
explanation
she
was
gathered
into
her
lovers
strong
arms
with
a
passion
he
had
never
as
yet
shown
in
his
chivalrous
relations
with
her
but
it
was
not
because
they
met
without
the
sympathetic
rapture
of
miss
landales
eye
upon
them
not
because
there
was
no
other
witnesses
but
the
dangling
ivy
wreath
the
stern
old
walls
the
fine
dome
of
spring
sky
faintly
blue
not
because
of
lovers
audacious
joy
this
madeleine
feeling
the
stormy
throbbing
of
his
heart
against
hers
knew
with
sure
instinct
she
pushed
him
gently
from
her
as
soon
as
she
could
the
blushes
chased
from
her
cheeks
by
pale
misgivings
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
troubled
questioning
then
he
spoke
from
his
full
heart
madeleine
something

happeneda
misfortune

i
wrote

they

tracked

suspicion
has
been
aroused
i
cannot

have
been

trust

she
hung
upon
his
hot
words
looking
at
him
with
loving
frightened
eyes
now
he
gathered
her
to
his
arms
again
again
his
bursting
heart
throbbed
its
stormy
passion
to
her
ear
she
was
as
one
carried
away
by
a
torrent
against
which
resistance
is
useless
he
bent
his
head
over
her
face
the
scent
of
the
bunch
of
violets
in
her
breast
rose
deliciously
to
his
nostrils
alas
hubert
cochrane
was
not
to
reach
that
kiss
of
acquiescence
that
kiss
from
which
it
seemed
that
but
so
small
a
fraction
of
space
and
time
divided
him
some
one
who
had
stepped
along
in
the
shadow
as
silently
as
a
cat
coming
upon
a
bird
clapped
here
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
who
are
you
sir
and
what
do
you
want
exclaimed
captain
jack
wrenching
himself
free
falling
back
a
pace
and
measuring
the
newcomer
from
head
to
foot
with
furious
glances
while
with
burning
blushes
madeleine
faltered
rupert
nothing
awakens
anger
in
hot
blood
sooner
than
an
unsanctioned
touch
in
certain
moods
the
merest
contact
is
as
infuriating
as
a
blow
such
an
insult
added
to
the
irreparable
injury
of
interrupting
their
meeting
at
the
most
exquisite
and
crucial
moment
drove
captain
jack
beside
himself
with
rage
but
madeleines
hand
was
still
on
his
arm
she
felt
it
suddenly
harden
and
twitch
with
murderous
anger
but
by
an
effort
that
made
the
veins
of
his
temple
swell
like
whipcord
he
refrained
from
striking
the
double
offender
mr
landale
surveyed
the
pair
for
a
moment
in
silence
with
his
grave
look
then
coldly
he
answered
the
sailors
irate
speech
my
name
fellow
is
rupert
landale
i
am
here
to
protect
my
cousin
from
an
unprincipled
and
criminal
adventurer
you
take
a
sharp
tone
sir
cried
captain
jack
the
flush
on
his
face
deepening
yet
a
shade
his
nostrils
ominously
dilated
yet
speaking
without
further
loss
of
selfcontrol
you
probably
count
upon
the
presence
of
this
lady
to
prevent
my
resenting
it
but
as
my
time
with
her
is
short
and
i
have
still
much
to
say
i
shall
be
forced
promptly
to
eject
you
from
the
ruins
here
unless
you
will
be
good
enough
to
immediately
remove
yourself
i
shall
hope
for
another
meeting
with
you
to
discuss
the
question
as
to
your
right
of
interference
but
todayi
cannot
spare
the
time
rupert
smiled
without
moving
then
the
sailor
gently
disengaging
himself
from
madeleine
would
have
put
her
behind
him
but
that
she
pressed
forward
and
laid
a
hand
upon
an
arm
of
each
of
the
men
stay
jack
she
pleaded
let
me
speak
there
is
some
mistake
here
cousin
rupert
you
cannot
know
that
i
am
engaged
to
this
gentleman
and
that
he
is
a
friend
of
your
brothers
as
well
as
of
other
good
friends
of
mine
my
poor
child
answered
rupert
closing
a
cold
hand
gently
over
hers
and
speaking
with
a
most
delicate
tenderness
of
accent
you
have
been
grossly
imposed
upon
and
so
have
others
as
for
my
poor
brother
adrian
he
is
if
anything
easier
to
deceive
than
you
innocent
conventbred
girl
i
would
have
you
to
go
home
my
dear
and
leave
me
to
deal
with
thisgentleman
you
have
bitter
truths
to
learn
would
it
not
be
better
to
wait
and
learn
them
quietly
without
further
scandal
this
was
too
much
for
captain
jack
who
fairly
ground
his
teeth
ruperts
honeyed
tones
his
grasp
of
madeleines
hand
were
more
unbearable
even
than
the
words
he
advanced
upon
the
elder
man
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
whirled
him
away
from
the
girl
as
easily
as
a
straw
puppet
the
fine
gentleman
of
sensitive
nerves
and
unworked
sinews
had
no
chance
against
the
iron
strength
of
the
man
who
had
passed
all
the
years
of
virility
fighting
against
sea
and
storm
the
two
faced
each
other
jack
smith
red
and
panting
with
honest
rage
only
the
sense
of
his
ladys
proximity
keeping
him
from
carrying
his
highhanded
measures
a
little
further
mr
landale
livid
with
eyes
suddenly
black
in
their
orbits
moistening
his
white
lips
while
he
quivered
from
head
to
foot
with
a
passion
so
tense
that
not
even
his
worst
enemy
could
have
attributed
it
to
fear
an
unequal
match
it
would
seem
yet
unequal
in
a
way
that
the
young
man
in
the
conscious
glory
of
his
strength
could
not
have
conceived
madeleine
neither
screamed
nor
fainted
she
had
grown
white
in
natural
apprehension
but
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
lovers
face
shone
with
admiration
mr
landale
turned
slowly
towards
her
madeleine
he
said
readjusting
his
stock
and
smoothing
the
folds
of
his
collar
with
a
steadfast
striving
after
coolness
you
have
been
grossly
deceived
the
man
you
would
trust
with
your
life
and
honour
is
a
mere
smuggler
he
has
no
doubt
told
you
fine
stories
but
if
he
has
given
himself
out
for

take
my

for
ithe

smuggler
and
the
vessel

you
away
in

packed
with
smuggled
goods
today
he
has
attacked
and
wounded
an
officer
who
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
endeavoured
to

nature

at

in

himself
to
a
shriller
pitchhe

it
madeleine
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
her
mind
never
a
very
quick
one
at
decision
was
too
bewildered
to
act
with
clearness
moreover
with
her
education
and
ignorance
of
the
world
the
indictment
conveyed
no
special
meaning
to
her
but
there
was
an
agony
of
suspense
and
beseeching
in
the
glance
that
her
lover
cast
upon
her
and
to
that
appeal
she
smiled
proudly
hers
were
no
true
love
she
felt
were
its
confidence
shaken
by
the
slandering
of
anger
then
the
thought
of
his
danger
danger
admitted
by
his
own
lips
flashed
upon
her
with
terror
she
rushed
to
him
oh
go
jack
goas
you
love
me
go
mr
landale
who
had
already
once
or
twice
cast
impatient
looks
of
expectation
through
a
window
of
the
east
wall
taken
by
surprise
at
this
unforeseen
result
of
his
speech
suddenly
climbed
up
upon
a
broken
piece
of
stonework
from
which
there
was
an
abrupt
descent
towards
the
shore
and
began
to
signal
in
eager
gesticulation
there
was
a
sound
of
heavy
running
footfalls
without
captain
jack
raised
his
head
every
nerve
on
the
alert
go
go
again
cried
madeleine
dreading
she
knew
not
whata
fat
panting
red
face
looked
over
the
wall
mr
landale
turned
for
a
second
to
throw
at
the
lovers
a
glance
of
elation
but
it
seemed
as
if
the
sailors
spirits
rose
at
the
breath
of
danger
he
rapidly
looked
round
upon
the
ruins
from
which
there
were
no
other
outlets
than
the
window
guarded
by
mr
landale
and
the
doorway
in
which
the
redfaced
newcomer
now
stood
framed
in
red
stone
then
like
a
cat
he
darted
on
to
the
ledge
of
the
wall
at
the
opposite
end
where
some
invading
boughs
of
larch
dropped
over
the
jagged
crest
before
the
burly
figure
in
the
blue
coat
of
the
preventive
service
had
recovered
from
the
surprise
of
finding
a
lady
in
his
way
or
gathered
his
wits
and
his
breath
sufficiently
to
interfere
there
the
nimble
climber
stood
a
moment
balancing
himself
lightly
though
the
ivied
stones
rocked
beneath
him
i
go
love
he
cried
in
ringing
voice
but
one
word
from
you
and
i
go
oh
i
trust
you
i
will
trust
you
screamed
the
girl
in
despair
while
her
fascinated
gaze
clung
to
the
erect
figure
silhouetted
against
the
sky
and
the
stout
man
looked
up
openmouthed
mr
landale
snarled
at
him
shoot
foolshoot
and
straining
forward
himself
drew
a
pistol
from
the
mans
belt
cocked
it
and
thrust
it
into
his
grasp
captain
jack
kissed
his
hand
to
madeleine
with
a
joyful
gesture
then
waved
his
hat
defiantly
in
ruperts
direction
and
with
a
spring
disappeared
just
as
the
pistol
cracked
drawing
a
shriek
of
terror
from

its
bullet
flattened
itself
against
the
upper
stone
of
the
wallconsiderably
wide
of
the
mark
come
this
way
screamed
mr
landale
from
his
window
sill
you
have
another
but
the
preventive
shook
his
head
and
thrust
his
smoking
barrel
back
through
his
belt
with
an
air
of
philosophical
resignation
and
slowly
approaching
the
window
through
which
the
fugitive
could
now
be
seen
steadily
bowling
down
the
seaward
slope
observed
in
slow
fat
tones
give
you
a
hand
sir
rupert
thrusting
his
extended
arm
aside
jumped
down
beside
him
as
if
he
would
have
sprung
at
his
throat
why
are
you
so
latewhy
have
you
brought
no
one
with
you
i
gave
you
notice
enough
you
fool
you
have
let
him
slip
through
your
fingers
now
after
all
couldnt
you
even
shoot
straight
such
a
mark
as
he
made
against
the
skypah
well
may
the
sailors
say
lubberly
as
a
land
preventive
why
there
you
are
mr
landale
answered
the
man
with
imperturbable
greasy
goodhumour
the
way
you
shoved
that
there
pistol
into
my
hand
was
enough
to
put
off
anybody
but
you
country
magistrate
gentlemen
as
i
have
always
said
you
are
the
real
sort
to
make
one
do
illegal
actions
with
your
flurry
and
your
hurry
over
everything
shoot
says
you
and
damme
sir
if
i
didnt
shoot
straight
off
before
i
knew
if
i
were
on
my
head
or
on
my
heels
its
a
mercy
i
didnt
hit
the
sweet
young
ladyit
is
indeed
and
as
for
the
young
gentleman
though
to
be
sure
he
did
show
a
clean
pair
of
heels
at
the
sight
of
me
i
had
no
proper
time
for
identificationno
time
for
identification
mr
landale
sir
so
i
say
sir
its
a
mercy
i
did
not
hit
him
either
now
i
can
think
of
it
ah
slow
and
sure
thats
my
motter
i
takes
my
man
on
his
boat
in
the
very
middle
of
his
laces
and
his
brandy
and
his
silki
takes
him
sir
in
the
very
act
of
illegality
redhanded
so
to
speak
and
then
if
he
shows
fight
or
if
he
runs
away
then
i
shoots
sir
and
then
if
i
hits
why
its
a
good
job
toobut
none
of
this
promiscuous
work
for
augustus
hobson
slow
and
sure
thats
my
motter
the
speaker
who
had
been
rolling
a
quid
of
tobacco
in
his
mouth
during
this
exposition
of
policy
here
spat
emphatically
upon
the
grass
and
catching
madeleines
abstracted
eye
begged
pardon
for
the
liberty
with
a
gallant
air
aye
so
slow
man
that
you
are
pretty
sure
to
fail
muttered
mr
landale
i
knows
my
business
sir
meaning
no
offence
retorted
mr
hobson
serenely
when
i
has
no
orders
i
acts
on
regulation
i
brought
no
one
with
me
because
i
had
no
one
to
bring
having
sent
as
per
regulation
my
one
remaining
man
to
give
notice
to
the
water
service
seeing
that
that
there
schooner
has
had
the
impudence
to
come
back
and
is
at
this
very
moment
cruising
quite
happylike
just
the
other
side
of
the
bank
though
if
ever
their
cutter
overhauls
herwell
im
a
dutchman
you
might
have
done
wiser
perhaps
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
remark
to
leave
the
management
of
this
business
to
them
as
understands
such
things
as
to
being
late
sir
you
told
me
to
be
in
the
ruins
at
twelve
noon
and
i
beg
to
insinuate
that
its
only
just
past
the
hour
now
at
this
point
the
preventive
man
drew
from
his
capacious
breeches
a
brass
timepiece
of
congenial
stoutness
the
face
of
which
he
turned
towards
the
magistrate
the
latter
however
waved
the
proffered
witness
impatiently
aside
furtively
watching
his
cousin
who
leaning
against
the
doorpost
her
pale
head
thrown
out
in
strong
relief
by
the
dark
stones
stood
as
if
absolutely
detached
from
her
surroundings
communing
over
troubled
thoughts
with
her
own
soul
he
said
with
deliberate
distinctness
but
have
i
been
misled
then
in
understanding
that
you
were
with
the
unfortunate
officer
who
was
so
ferociously
assaulted
this
morning
that
you
and
he
did
come
upon
this
captain
smith
redhanded
as
you
call
it
loading
or
unloading
his
vessel
on
scarthey
island
aye
sir
rolled
out
the
other
unctuously
there
you
are
again
you
see
poor
nat
beavor
he
was
one
of
your
hotheaded
ones
and
see
what
it
has
brought
him
toa
crack
in
his
skull
sir
so
that
it
will
be
days
before
hell
know
himself
again
the
doctor
says
if
ever
he
does
in
this
world
which
i
dont
think
ah
i
says
to
him
when
we
started
in
the
dawn
this
morning
agreeable
to
our
arrangement
with
you
for
peeping
and
prying
on
the
quiet
without
any
running
risks
and
provoking
others
to
break
the
law
more
than
theyre
doing
im
your
man
says
i
but
as
for
attacking
desperate
individles
without
proper
warrant
and
authority
not
to
speak
of
being
one
to
ten
i
tell
you
fair
nat
beavor
ill
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
nat
he
went
off
his
head
clean
at
the
sight
of
captain
jack
and
his
men
a
trundling
the
little
kegs
down
the
sands
as
neat
and
tidy
as
could
be
and
so
he
cut
out
from
behind
the
rocks
and
i
knew
there
was
mischief
ahead
ah
poor
fellow
if
he
would
only
have
listened
to
me
i
did
my
best
for
him
sir
started
off
to
call
up
the
other
man
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
ruins
as
soon
as
i
saw
his
danger
but
when
i
came
back
the
birds
were
flown
of
course
interrupted
rupert
with
a
sneer
and
you
found
the
body
of
your
comrade
who
had
been
dastardly
wounded
and
who
i
hear
is
dead
now
so
the
villain
has
twice
escaped
you
cousin
madeleine
hastily
breaking
off
to
advance
to
the
girl
who
now
awakening
from
her
reflective
mood
seemed
about
to
leave
the
ruins
cousin
madeleine
are
you
going
let
me
escort
you
back
she
slowly
turned
her
blue
eyes
burning
upon
him
from
her
white
face
cousin
rupert
i
do
not
want
your
company
then
she
added
in
a
whisper
yet
with
a
passion
for
which
rupert
would
never
have
given
her
credit
and
which
took
him
vastly
by
surprise
i
shall
never
forgive
you
my
god
madeleine
cried
he
with
genuine
emotion
have
i
deserved
this
i
have
had
no
thought
but
to
befriend
you
i
have
opened
your
eyes
to
your
own
danger
hold
your
tongue
sir
she
broke
in
with
the
same
repressed
anger
cease
vilifying
the
man
i
love
all
your
aspersions
your
wordy
accusations
will
not
shake
my
faith
in
him
mon
dieu
she
cried
with
an
unsteady
attempt
at
laughter
looking
under
her
lashes
and
tilting
her
little
white
round
chin
at
mr
hobson
who
now
seated
upon
a
large
stone
and
with
an
obtrusive
quid
of
tobacco
bulging
in
an
imperfectly
shorn
cheek
was
mopping
his
forehead
with
a
doubtful
handkerchief
that
is
the
person
i
suppose
whose
testimony
i
am
to
believe
against
my
jack
your
jack
was
prompt
enough
in
running
away
from
him
such
as
he
is
retorted
her
cousin
bitterly
he
could
not
have
struck
for
his
purpose
upon
a
weaker
joint
in
her
poor
womans
armour
of
pride
and
trust
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
as
if
indeed
she
had
received
a
blow
well
say
your
say
she
exclaimed
coming
to
a
standstill
and
facing
him
i
will
hear
all
that
you
and
youryour
friend
have
to
say
lest
with
a
magnificent
toss
of
her
head
you
fancy
i
am
afraid
or
that
i
believe
one
word
of
it
all
i
know
that
jackthat
captain
smith
as
he
is
calledis
engaged
upon
a
secret
and
important
mission
but
it
is
one
rupert
which
all
english
gentlemen
should
wish
to
help
not
impede
do
you
know
what
the
mission
isdo
you
know
to
whom
and
if
my
fair
cousin
it
is
such
that
all
english
gentlemen
would
help
why
then
this
secrecy
she
bit
her
lip
but
it
trembled
what
is
it
you
accuse
him
of
she
asked
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
listen
to
me
said
rupert
gently
it
is
the
kinder
thing
that
you
should
know
the
truth
and
believe
me
every
word
i
say
i
can
substantiate
this
captain
jack
smith
whatever
his
real
name
may
be
was
picked
up
when
a
mere
boy
by
an
old
liverpool
merchant
starving
in
the
streets
of
that
town
this
merchant
by
name
cochrane
an
absurd
person
who
gave
himself
out
to
be
a
relative
of
cochrane
of
shaws
adopted
the
boy
and
started
him
upon
a
slaver
that
is
a
ship
which
does
trade
in
negro
slaves
my
deara
pretty
trade
he
next
entered
a
privateers
ship
as
lieutenant
you
know
what
these
areocean
freebooters
tolerated
by
government
for
the
sake
of
the
harm
they
wreck
upon
the
ships
of
whatever
nation
we
may
happen
to
be
at
war
witha
sort
of
pirate
shiphardly
a
much
more
reputable
business
than
the
slavers
but
captain
smith
made
himself
a
name
in
it
now
that
the
war
is
over
he
has
taken
to
a
lower
traffic
stillthat
of
smuggling
but
what
is
smuggling
cried
the
girl
tears
brimming
up
at
last
into
her
pretty
eyes
and
all
her
heat
of
valiance
suddenly
gone
what
does
it
mean
what
is
smuggling
bless
your
innocence
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dearmiss
i
should
saybut
if
youll
allow
me
i
think
im
the
man
to
explain
that
ere
to
you
the
husky
mellifluous
tones
of
the
preventiveservice
man
who
had
crept
up
unnoticed
to
listen
to
the
conversation
here
murmured
insinuatingly
in
her
ear
rupert
hesitated
then
reading
shrinking
aversion
upon
madeleines
face
shrewdly
conjectured
that
the
exposition
of
her
lovers
doings
might
come
with
more
force
from
mr
hobsons
lips
than
from
his
own
and
allowed
the
latter
to
proceed
unmolested
smuggling
my
pretty
wheezed
the
genial
representative
of
the
custom
laws
again
asking
pardon
but
it
slipped
out
smuggling
is
so
to
say
a
kind
of
stealing
a
kind
of
cheating
and
that
of
a
most
rank
and
heinous
kind
for
mind
you
it
aint
stealing
from
a
common
man
nor
from
the
likes
of
you
and
me
nor
from
a
nobleman
either
its
cheating
and
stealing
from
his
most
gracious
majesty
himself
for
see
you
how
tis
his
majesty
he
says
every
keg
of
brandy
says
he
and
every
yard
of
lace
and
every
pipe
o
tobacco
as
is
brought
into
this
here
country
shall
be
paid
for
so
much
on
to
me
and
thats
called
a
tax
miss
and
for
that
there
are
the
custom
houses
and
custom
officerswhich
is
meto
see
his
majesty
paid
right
and
proper
his
lawful
dues
but
what
does
your
smuggler
do
missyour
rollicking
daredevil
chap
of
a
smuggler
why
he
lands
his
lace
and
his
brandy
and
his
baccy
unbeknownst
and
sells
em
on
the
slyand
pockets
the
profit
dye
seeand
so
he
cheats
his
majesty
which
is
a
very
grievous
breaking
of
the
law
so
much
so
that
he
might
as
well
murder
at
oncekind
o
treason
you
may
sayand
thats
what
makes
em
such
desperate
chaps
they
knows
if
theyre
caught
at
it
with
arms
about
them

three
togetheritsclank
mr
hobson
grasped
his
own
bull
neck
with
an
unpleasantly
significant
gesture
and
winked
knowingly
at
the
girl
who
turned
white
as
death
and
remained
gazing
at
him
with
a
sort
of
horrified
fascination
which
he
presently
noted
with
an
indulgent
smile

the

drew
back
with
a

of
loathing
from
the

rupert
cried
madeleine
piteously
turning
a
dark
gaze
of
anguish
at
himit
seemed
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
he
hastened
up
to
her
shouldering
the
clumsy
form
of
mr
augustus
hobson
unceremoniously
out
of
the
way
the
fellow
had
done
his
work
for
the
time
being
and
this
last
piece
of
it
so
efficaciously
indeed
that
his
present
employer
felt
if
not
remorse
at
least
a
certain
pity
stir
within
him
at
the
stricken
hopelessness
of
the
girls
aspect
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
she
shivered
and
swayed
lean
on
me
he
said
his
fine
eyes
troubled
with
an
unwonted
softness
and
anxiety
rupert
she
whispered
clutching
at
his
sleeve
eagerly
fixing
him
with
a
look
eloquent
of
unconscious
pleading
all
these
things
thisthis
man
talks
of
are
things
which
are
brought
into
englandare
they
not
i
know
thathe
was
bringing
nothing
into
the
country
but
he
was
going
to
another
country
upon
some
important
trust
the
nature
of
which
he
had
promised
not
to
reveal
therefore
he
cannot
be
cheating
the
king
if
that
is
smugglingoh
rupert
is
there
not
some
grievous
mistake
my
poor
child
said
rupert
holding
her
close
and
tenderly
and
speaking
with
a
gentle
gravity
in
which
there
was
this
time
less
hypocrisy
there
is
one
thing
which
is
smuggled
out
of
england
and
it
is
as
dishonest
and
illegal
work
as
the
other
the
most
daring
and
dangerous
smuggling
of
all
in
fact
one
in
which
none
but
a
desperate
man
would
engagethat
of
gold
yes
gold
exclaimed
the
girl
sharply
withdrawing
herself
from
her
cousins
arms
while
a
ray
of
intelligence
and
hope
lit
up
her
face

the
french
kings

rupert
betrayed
no
emotion
he
drew
from
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
a
crushed
newssheet
deceived
there
as
well
as
everywhere
else
poor
little
cousin
he
said
and
did
the
scoundrel
say
so
nay
he
is
a
damnable
scoundrel
who
could
betray
your
trustfulness

your
own
sweet

not
for
the

for
the

for
the

who
was
supplied
already
no
doubt
by
the
same
or
similar
traitor
hands
with
enough
to
enable
him
to
escape
from
the
island
where
he
was
so
justly
imprisoned
see
here
madeleine
bonaparte
is
actually
landed
in
france
it
has
all
been
managed
with
the
most
devilish
ingenuity
and
takes
the
whole
world
by
surprise
and
your
lover
doubtless
is
engaged
upon
bringing
him
fresh
supplies
to
enable
him
to
begin
again
and
rack
humanity
with
hideous
wars
oh
he
never
told
you
of
the
corsicans
escape
yet
this
news
is
three
days
old
see
you
my
dear
this
explains
the
whole
mystery
the
necessity
for
absolute
secrecy
all
england
is
friendly
to
the
french
monarch
no
need
to
smuggle
gold
for
his
aidbut
the
other
it
is
treason
the
blackest
treason
on
every
side
of
it
treason
to
his
king
to
his
country
to
your
king
to
you
and
he
would
have
cozened
you
with
tales
of
his
loyalty
to
the
rightful
cause
give
me
the
paper
said
madeleine
a
tide
of
blood
had
swept
into
her
face
she
was
no
longer
white
and
shaken
but
erect
and
beautiful
in
strong
indignation
rupert
examined
her
as
if
a
little
doubtful
how
to
take
the
sudden
change
but
he
handed
her
the
printed
sheet
in
silence
she
read
with
lips
and
nostrils
expanded
by
her
quick
breathing
then
crumpled
up
the
sheet
and
cast
it
at
his
feet
and
after
a
pause
with
her
princess
air
of
dignity
i
thank
you
cousin
rupert
she
said
then
passing
him
with
stately
steps
moved
towards
the
house
he
pressed
forward
to
keep
up
with
her
and
upon
the
other
side
smiling
irrepressible
jocose
mr
hobson
did
the
same
you
are
not
fit
to
go
alone
urged
the
former
while
the
latter
engagingly
protruding
an
elbow
announced
that
hed
be
proud
to
give
her
an
arm
as
far
as
the
hall
she
drew
away
from
this
wellmeaning
squire
of
dames
with
such
shuddering
distaste
and
looked
once
more
so
white
and
worn
and
sickened
after
her
sudden
blaze
of
passion
that
mr
landale
seeing
that
the
only
kindness
was
to
let
her
have
her
will
arrested
his
companion
roughly
enough
and
allowed
her
to
proceed
as
she
wished





and
so
with
bent
head
madeleine
hurried
forth
and
the
same
glorious
sun
smiled
down
upon
her
in
her
anguish
that
had
greeted
her
when
she
hastened
an
hour
before
glowing
and
lightheartedif
indeed
a
heart
so
full
of
love
could
be
termed
lightto
meet
her
lover
the
same
brambles
caught
her
dress
the
same
bird
trilled
his
song
but
madeleine
thought
neither
of
ray
nor
leaf
nor
yet
of
mating
songsters
all
the
spring
world
as
she
went
was
to
her
strewn
with
the
wreck
of
her
broken
hopes
and
encompassed
by
the
darkness
of
her
lonely
future





mr
landale
and
the
preventive
service
man
stood
some
time
watching
her
retreating
figure
through
the
wood
and
then
walked
slowly
on
for
a
while
in
silent
company
presently
the
latter
who
during
the
last
part
of
the
interview
had
begun
to
feel
a
little
ruffled
by
the
magistrates
persistently
overbearing
manner
inquired
with
something
of
dudgeon
in
his
voice
begging
your
pardon
sir
what
was
that
i
heard
the
young
lady
call
out
just
now
gold
she
cries
is
it
guineas
that
nipping
young
man
is
a
taking
over
seas
if
i
may
make
so
bold
now
you
see
sir
we
havent
had
no
orders
about
no
gold
on
this
stationthat
sort
of
thing
is
mostly
done
down
south
but
what
i
wants
to
know
is
why
if
you
knew
all
about
the
fellows
little
games
you
sent
us
to
spy
on
him
ah
poor
nat
would
want
a
word
or
two
with
you
on
that
score
i
fancy
now
its
as
plain
as
salisbury
but
i
know
nothing
certain
impatiently
interrupted
mr
landale
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
yourself
only
not
being
a
perfect
idiot
i
can
put
two
and
two
together
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
can
a
man
smuggle
out
of
england
but
gold
but
i
wanted
the
proofs
and
your
business
it
was
agreed
with
the
chief
officer
was
to
follow
my
instructions
and
so
we
did
grumbled
mr
hobson
and
a
pretty
business
its
turned
out
nats
to
pocket
his
bludgeoning
i
suppose
and
i
am
to
bear
the
blame
and
lose
my
share
a
cargo
of
guineas
by
god
i
might
have
nosed
it
down
south
but
here
blast
it
but
since
you
was
so
clever
over
it
sir
why
in
blazesif
i
may
speak
so
to
a
gentleman
and
a
magistrate
pursued
the
man
with
a
rueful
explosion
of
disgust
didnt
you
give
me
the
hint
why
guineas
is
contraband
of
warits
treason
sirand
guineas
is
a
cargo
thats
fought
for
sir
i
shouldnt
have
moved
with
two
men
in
a
boat
patrol
dye
think
i
should
have
had
the
riding
officers
and
the
waterguard
and
a
revenue
cruiser
in
the
offing
and
all
tight
and
regular
but
you
would
have
all
the
credit
and
where
are
you
and
wheres
my
share
and
where
is
natbah
you
are
forgetting
yourself
officer
said
mr
landale
looking
severely
into
the
eyes
of
the
disappointed
preventive
man
whose
rising
ebullition
became
on
the
instant
reduced
so
i
am
sir
so
i
amand
beg
your
pardon
but
you
must
admit
its
almost
enough
to
make

but
never
mind
sir
the
trick
is
done
whatever
it
may
be
that
that
there
schooner
carries
in
her
bottom
she
is
free
now
to
take
it
barring
accident
wherever
she
pleases
ill
trouble
you
to
look
this
way
sir
they
had
emerged
from
the
wooded
part
of
the
park
and
the
rising
ground
on
which
they
stood
commanded
a
wide
seaview
west
of
the
great
bay
there
she
is
again
sir
said
mr
hobson
waving
his
broad
paw
like
a
showman
displaying
his
goods
with
a
sort
of
enraged
selfsatisfaction
there
is
the
schooner
ready
to
hoist
sail
as
soon
as
he
comes
alongside
and
that
there
black
point
which
you
may
see
if
your
eyes
are
good
enough
is
a
sixoared
galley
with
as
shipshaped
a
crewif
its
the
same
as
i
saw
making
off
this
morningas
ever
pulled
your
captain
smith
you
may
take
your
oath
is
at
the
tiller
and
making
fun
of
us
two
to
the
lads
in
five
minutes
he
will
be
on
board
and
then
the
revenue
cutter
from
the
station
may
give
chase
if
she
likes
and
there
she
is
due
to
the
timeabout
a
mile
astern
but
bless
you
thats
all
my
eye
you
may
take
your
oath
they
know
well
enough
that
in
an
open
sea
they
cant
run
down
a
salcombe
schooner
but
to
earn
their
pay
they
will
hang
on
till
they
lose
her
and
then
sail
home
all
cosyim
thinking
he
added
slily
with
a
side
glance
at
the
magistrate
we
wont
hang
him
this
time
mr
landale
made
no
answer
during
the
last
few
minutes
his
reflections
had
enabled
him
to
take
a
new
view
of
the
situation
after
all
the
future
fate
of
captain
jack
was
of
little
moment
he
had
been
successfully
exposed
before
madeleine
whose
love
for
the
young
man
was
as
had
just
been
sufficiently
proved
chiefly
composed
of
those
youthful
illusions
which
dispelled
once
never
can
return
rupert
fell
gradually
into
a
reverie
in
which
he
found
curious
satisfaction
his
work
had
not
been
unsuccessful
whatever
mr
hobsons
opinion
might
be
but
as
matters
stood
between
madeleine
and
her
lover
the
girls
eyes
had
been
opened
in
time
and
that
without
scandal
and
even
the
escape
of
captain
jack
was
upon
reflection
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
and
so
it
was
with
a
return
to
his
usual
polite
bearing
that
he
listened
to
the
officers
relapse
into
expostulation
now
if
you
had
only
given
me
the
hint
first
of
all
the
man
was
grumblingly
saying
and
then
let
me
actfor
who
would
have
suspected
a
boat
yachtrigged
like
thata
friend
of
sir
adrians
too
if
youd
only
left
it
to
me
why
that
sixoared
galley
alone
is
agin
the
law
unless
you
can
prove
good
reason
for
it

as
for
the
vessel
herself
yes
my
dear
mr
hobson
interrupted
mr
landale
smiling
propitiously
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
have
secured
him
i
have
made
a
mess
of
it
but
now
you
understand
least
said
soonest
mended
both
for
me
and
between
ourselves
mr
hobson
for
the
young
lady
the
man
in
surprise
at
this
sudden
alteration
of
manner
stopped
short
and
gaped
and
presently
a
broad
smile
combined
with
a
knowing
wink
appeared
on
his
face
he
received
the
guineas
that
mr
landale
dropped
in
his
palm
with
an
air
of
great
candour
and
without
further
parley
acted
on
the
kind
advice
to
repair
to
the
priory
and
talk
with
one
mrs
puckett
the
housekeeper
on
the
subject
of
corporeal
refreshment





well
said
molly
bursting
in
upon
her
sister
who
sat
by
her
writingtable
pen
in
hand
and
did
not
even
raise
her
head
at
the
unceremonious
entrance
this
is
evidently
the
day
for
mysterious
disappearances
first
rupert
and
sophia
then
my
lord
and
master
who
is
fetched
hurriedly
to
his
island
that
isle
of
misfortune
god
knows
for
whatthough
i
mean
to
know
presently
then
you
mademoiselle
and
rupert
again
it
is
faith
quite
a
comedy
but
the
result
has
been
that
i
have
had
my
meals
alone
which
is
not
so
gay
sophia
is
in
bed
it
turns
out
rupert
out
ariding
on
important
business
of
course
all
he
does
is
desperately
important
and
there
you
arealone
in
your
room
moping
god
child
how
pale
you
are
what
ails
you
then
molly
cried
madeleine
ignoring
lady
landales
question
and
feverishly
folding
the
written
sheet
which
lay
under
her
hand
if
you
love
me
if
ever
you
loved
me
will
you
have
this
letter
conveyed
by
a
safe
messenger
to
scarthey
and
given
to

none
but
ren

once
oh

a
service

landale
coolly

if

droll
sort
of
plea
in
truth
considering
how
you
have
requited
my
love
madeleine
turned
a
dazed
look
upon
her
sister
who
stood
surveying
her
glowing
like
a
jewel
of
dazzling
radiance
from
her
setting
of
black
mantle
and
black
plumed
hat
so
you
will
not
she
answered
hopelessly
and
let
her
forehead
fall
upon
her
hand
without
further
protest
but
i
did
not
say
i
would

but
there

terrible
danger
in
his
being
there
at
all
molly
took
the
letter
turned
it
over
with
scornful
fingers
and
then
popped
it
in
her
pocket
if
he
expects
you
she
asked
fixing
cold
curious
eyes
on
her
sisters
distress
and
he
is
in
danger
why
dont
you
go
a
flush
rose
painfully
to
madeleines
face
a
sob
to
her
throat

she
murmured
turning
away
to
hide
her
humiliation
i
have
been
deceived
he
is
not
what
i
thought
lady
landale
gazed
at
the
shrinking
figure
for
a
little
while
in
silence
then
remarking
contemptuously
well
you
are
a
poor
creature
turned
upon
her
heel
to
leave
her
as
she
passed
the
little
altar
she
paused
to
whisk
a
bunch
of
violets
out
of
a
vase
and
dry
the
stems
upon
her
sisters
quilt
molly
cried
madeleine
in
a
frenzy
give
me
back
my
letter
or
go
i
go
i
go
said
lady
landale
with
a
mocking
laugh
how
sweet
your
violets
smellthere
do
not
agitate
yourself
im
going
to
meet
your
lover
my
dear
i
vow
i
am
curious
to
see
the
famous
man
at
last
chapter
xxiv
the
night
so
the
blood
burned
within
her
and
thus
it
cried
to
her
and
there
beside
the
maize
field
the
other
one
was
waiting
he
the
mysterious
one
luteplayers
song
the
mantle
of
night
had
already
fallen
upon
the
land
when
lady
landale
closely
wrapped
in
her
warmest
furs
with
face
well
ensconced
under
her
close
bonnet
and
arms
buried
to
the
elbow
in
her
muff
sallied
from
her
room
on
the
announcement
that
the
carriage
was
waiting
as
with
her
leisurely
daintiness
she
tripped
it
down
the
stairs
she
crossed
mr
landale
and
paused
a
moment
ready
for
the
skirmish
as
she
noticed
the
cynical
curiosity
with
which
he
examined
her
whither
my
fair
sister
said
he
ranging
himself
with
his
best
courtesy
against
the
bannisters
so
late
in
the
day
to
my
lord
and
masters
side
of
course
said
molly
whyis
not
adrian
coming
back
tonight
apparently
not
since
he
has
graciously
permitted
me
to
join
him
upon
his
rock
i
trust
you
will
not
find
it
too
unhappy
in
our
absence
that
would
be
the
crowning
misfortune
of
a
day
when
everything
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
sophia
invisible
with
her
vapours
madeleine
with
the
megrim
and
you
in
and
out
of
the
house
as
excited
and
secret
as
the
cat
when
she
has
licked
all
the
cream
i
suppose
i
shall
end
by
knowing
what
it
is
all
about
meanwhile
i
think
i
shall
enjoy
the
tranquillity
of
the
islandalthough
i
have
actually
to
tear
myself
away
from
the
prospect
of
a
ttette
evening
with
you
but
as
ruperts
serenity
was
not
to
be
moved
her
ladyship
hereupon
allowed
herself
to
be
escorted
to
the
carriage
without
further
parley
as
she
drove
away
through
the
dark
night
first
down
the
level
wellmetalled
avenue
then
along
the
uneven
country
road
and
finally
through
the
sand
of
the
beach
in
which
hoofs
and
tyres
sank
noiselessly
inches
deep
molly
gave
herself
up
with
almost
childish
zest
to
the
leaven
of
imagination
here
in
this
dark
carriage
was
reclining
not
lady
landale
whose
fate
deed
had
already
been
signed
sealed
and
delivered
to
bring
her
nothing
but
disappointment
but
her
happier
sister
still
confronted
with
the
fascinating
unknown
hurrying
under
cover
of
night
within
sound
of
the
sea
to
that
enthralling
lure
a
lovera
real
lover
ardent
daring
young
ready
to
risk
all
waiting
to
spread
the
wings
of
his
boat
and
carry
her
to
the
undiscovered
country
glowing
were
these
fleeting
images
of
the
might
have
been
angry
the
sudden
relapses
into
the
prose
of
reality
no
madeleine
the
coward
who
thought
she
had
loved
her
lover
was
now
in
her
room
weak
and
weeping
whilst
he
no
doubt
paced
the
deck
in
mad
impatience
as
a
lover
should
now
tortured
by
the
throes
of
anxiety
now
hugging
himself
with
the
thought
of
his
coming
bliss

that
bliss
that
never
was
to
be
his
and
in
the
carriage
there
was
only
molly
the
stronghearted
but
the
fettered
by
tie
and
vow
the
slave
for
ever
of
a
first
girlish
fancy
but
too
successfully
compassed
only
lady
landale
rejoining
her
husband
in
his
melancholy
solitude
lady
landale
who
nevernever
awful
word
would
know
the
joys
which
yonder
poor
fool
had
had
within
her
grasp
and
yet
had
not
clutched
at
molly
had
read
as
permitted
her
sisters
letter
and
to
some
purpose
and
scorn
of
the
girl
who
from
some
paltry
quibble
could
abandon
in
danger
the
man
she
professed
to
love
filled
her
soul
to
the
exclusion
of
any
sisterly
or
ever
womanly
pity
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
carriage
was
stopped
by
the
black
shadow
of
a
man
who
seemed
to
spring
up
from
the
earth
and
who
after
a
few
rapid
words
interchanged
with
the
coachman
extinguished
both
the
lights
and
then
opened
the
door
leaning
on
the
offered
elbow
molly
jumped
down
upon
the
yielding
sand
ren
she
asked
for
the
darkness
even
on
the
open
beach
was
too
thick
to
allow
of
recognition

your
ladyshipor
mademoiselle
is
it
answered
the
man
in
his
unmistakable
accent
i
must
ask
for
by
the
voice
no
one
can
tell
as
your
ladyship
or
mademoiselle
knowsand
the
sky
is
black
like
a
chimney
lady
landale
ren
and
as
he
paused
she
added
my
sister
would
not
come
ah
mon
dieu
she
would
not
come
repeated
the
man
in
tones
of
dismay
and
the
black
shadow
was
struck
into
a
moment
of
stillness
then
with
an
audible
sigh
mr
potter
roused
himself
and
saying
with
melancholy
resignation
the
boat
is
there
i
shall
be
of
return
in
a
minute
my
lady
took
the
travellers
bag
on
his
shoulder
and
disappeared
the
carriage
began
to
crunch
its
way
back
in
the
darkness
and
molly
was
left
alone





in
front
of
her
was
a
faint
white
line
where
the
rollers
spread
their
foam
with
mournful
restless
fugue
of
long
drawn
roar
and
hissing
sigh
in
the
distance
now
and
then
glancing
on
the
crest
of
the
dancing
billows
shone
the
steady
light
of
scarthey
the
rising
wind
whistled
in
the
prickly
stargrass
and
seaholly
beyond
these
not
a
sight
not
a
soundthe
earth
was
all
mystery
molly
looked
at
the
lightmarking
the
calm
spot
where
her
husband
waited
for
her
its
very
calm
its
familiar
placidity
monotony
enraged
her
she
hearkened
to
the
splashing
living
waves
to
the
swift
flying
gusts
of
the
storm
wind
and
her
soul
yearned
to
their
life
and
their
mysteriousness
what
she
longed
for
she
herself
could
not
tell
no
words
can
encompass
the
desire
of
pentup
young
vitality
for
the
unknown
for
the
ideal
for
the
impossible
but
one
thing
was
overpoweringly
real
that
was
the
dread
of
leaving
just
then
the
wide
the
open
world
whose
darkness
was
filled
to
her
with
living
scenes
of
freedom
and
space
and
bloodstirring
emotions
of
reentering
the
silent
room
under
the
light
of
consorting
with
the
shadowy
personality
her
husband
of
feeling
the
web
of
his
melancholy
his
dreaminess
imprison
as
it
were
the
wings
of
her
imagination
and
the
thoughtful
kindness
of
his
gaze
paralyse
the
course
of
her
hot
blood
through
her
veins
and
yet
thither
she
was
going
must
be
going
ah
madeleine
foolyou
may
well
weep
yonder
on
your
pillow
for
the
happiness
that
was
yours
and
that
you
have
dropped
from
your
feeble
hands





in
a
few
minutes
the
black
shadow
reappeared
close
to
her
if
my
lady
will
lean
on
my
shoulder
i
shall
lead
her
to
the
boat
and
after
a
few
steps
the
voice
out
of
the
darkness
proceeded
in
explanation
i
have
not
taken
a
lantern
i
have
put
out
those
of
the
carriage
for
i
must
tell
my
lady
that
since
what
arrived
this
morning
there
may
be
gabelousthey
call
them
the
preventive
herein
every
corner
and
the
light
might
bring
them
as
it
does
the
night
papilions
and

as
i
thought
mademoiselle
was
to
accompany
youthey
might
have
frightened
her
these
people
want
to
know
so
much
i
know
nothing
of
what
has
happened
this
morning
that
you
speak
of
as
if
the
whole
world
must
know
retorted
lady
landale
coolly
you
are
all
hatching
plots
and
sitting
on
secrets
but
nobody
confides
in
me
it
seems
then
that
you
expected
mademoiselle
my
sister
here
for
some
purpose
and
that
you
regret
she
did
not
come
may
i
ask
for
an
explanation
a
few
moments
elapsed
before
the
man
replied
and
then
it
was
with
embarrassment
and
diffidence
for
sure
i
am
sorry
my
lady

there
have
been
misfortunes
on
the
island
this
morningnothing
though
to
concern
her
ladyshipand
as
for
mademoiselle
mother
margery
would
have
liked
to
see
her
no
doubt

and
maggie
the
wife
alsoandand
no
doubt
also
mademoiselle
would
have
liked
to
come
what
do
i
know
oh
of
course
said
molly
with
her
little
note
of
mocking
laughter
then
again
they
walked
a
while
in
silence
as
ren
lifted
his
mistress
in
his
arms
to
carry
her
over
the
licking
hissing
foam
she
resumed
it
is
well
ren
you
are
discreet
but
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
people
seem
to
think
as
for
her
you
were
right
in
thinking
that
she
might
easily
be
frightened
she
was
afraid
even
to
come
out
ren
shoved
his
boat
off
and
falling
to
his
sculls
suddenly
relapsed
into
the
old
vernacular
ah
madame
he
sighed
cest
bien
tristeun
gentilhomme
si
beausi
brave
during
the
crossing
no
further
words
passed
between
them
so
braveso
handsome
the
echo
of
the
words
came
back
to
the
woman
in
every
lap
of
the
water
on
the
sides
of
the
boat
in
every
strain
of
the
oars
the
keel
ground
against
the
beach
and
ren
leaped
out
to
drag
the
boat
free
of
the
surf
as
he
did
so
two
blacker
outlines
segregated
themselves
from
the
darkness
and
a
rough
voice
called
out
subdued
but
distinct
savenaye
st
malo
savenaye
st
malo
repeated
ren
and
helped
lady
landale
to
alight
then
one
of
the
figures
darted
forward
and
whispered
a
rapid
sentence
in
the
frenchmans
ear
ren
uttered
an
exclamation
but
his
mistress
intervened
with
scant
patience
my
good
ren
said
she
take
the
bag
into
the
peel
and
come
back
for
me
i
have
a
message
for
these
gentlemen
ren
hesitated
as
he
did
so
a
rustle
of
anger
shook
the
lady
in
her
silks
and
furs
do
you
hear
me
she
repeated
and
he
could
guess
how
her
little
foot
stamped
the
yielding
sand
oui
madame
said
he
hesitating
no
longer
immediately
the
other
two
drew
near
molly
could
just
see
that
they
stood
in
all
deference
cap
in
hand
madam
began
one
of
these
in
hurried
words
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
captain
had
to
remain
on
board
what
interrupted
lady
landale
with
much
asperity
not
come
in
person
she
had
been
straining
her
eyes
to
make
out
something
of
her
interlocutors
form
unable
to
reconcile
her
minds
picture
with
the
coarse
voice
that
addressed
herand
now
all
her
high
expectations
fell
from
her
in
an
angry
rush
have
i
come
all
this
way
to
be
met
by
a
messenger
who
are

the
husky
voice
i

mate
of
the
peregrine

captain
has
directed
me
to
beg
and

courage
and

five
minutes

be
safe
on
board

see
madam
continued
the
man
with
an
earnestness
that
spoke
well
of
his
devotion
the
captain
found
he
couldnt
he
dared
not
leave
the
shiphe
is
the
only
one
who
knows
the
bearings
of
these
waters
hereany
one
of
us

run
her
on
the
bank
and
where
would

and

partsfor

he
implore
the
lady
not
to
be
afraid
and
tell
her
to
trust
as
she
has
promised

minutes

the
word

to
make
the
signal
there
he
is
eating
his
heart
out
there
are
all
the
lads
ready
waiting
for
your
foot
on
the
ladder
to
hoist
sail
no
time
to
lose
we
are
already
behind
shall
i
signal
mollys
heart
beat
violently
under
the
sudden
impulse
the
fascination
of
the
black
chasm
of
the
peril
the
adventure
the
unfathomed
took
possession
of
her
and
whirled
her
on
yes
she
said
on
the
very
utterance
of
the
word
the
man
who
had
not
yet
spoken
uncovered
a
lantern
held
it
aloft
as
rapidly
replaced
it
under
his
coat
and
moved
away
almost
immediately
against
the
black
pall
behind
the
dim
line
of
grey
that
marked
the
shore
suddenly
sprang
up
three
bright
points
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
it
was
as
if
all
the
darkness
around
had
been
filled
with
life
as
if
the
first
fulfilment
of
those
promises
with
which
it
had
been
drawing
this
womans
soul
was
now
held
out
to
her
to
lure
her
further
still
see
madam
how
they
watchby
your
leave
and
with
no
further
warning
molly
felt
herself
seized
with
uncompromising
but
deferential
energy
by
a
pair
of
powerful
arms
lifted
like
a
child
and
carried
away
at
a
bearlike
trot
by
the
splashing
she
judged
it
was
through
the
first
line
of
breakers
then
she
was
handed
into
another
irresistible
grasp
the
boat
lurched
as
the
mate
jumped
in
then
now
give
way
lads
he
said
and
let
her
have
it
those
lights
must
not
be
burning
longer
than
we
can
help
taint
wholesome
for
any
of
us
and
under
the
pulse
of
four
willing
pairs
of
arms
the
skiff
like
a
thing
of
life
clove
the
black
waters
and
rose
to
the
billows
you
see
madam
explained
the
mate
we
could
not
do
without
the
lights
to
show
us
where
she
lay
and
give
us
a
straight
course
we
are
all
right
so
long
as
we
keep
that
top
un
in
the
middlebut
he
wont
be
sorry
i
reckon
when
he
can
drop
them
overboard
they
cant
be
seen
from
the
offing
yet
but
its
astounding
how
far
a
light
will
reach
on
a
night
like
this
cheerily
lads
let
her
have
it
but
molly
heeded
him
not
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
the
thrilling
delight
of
the
excitement
the
die
was
castnot
by
her
own
hand
no
one
should
be
able
to
hold
her
responsibleshe
had
been
kidnapped
come
what
might
she
must
now
see
the
adventure
out
the
lights
grew
larger
presently
a
black
mass
surmounted
by
a
kind
of
greyish
cloud
loomed
through
the
pitch
of
the
night
and
next
it
was
evident
that
the
beacon
was
hanging
over
the
side
of
a
ship
illuminating
its
jagged
leaping
water
line
a
voice
not
too
loud
yet
even
through
the
distance
ringing
clear
in
its
earnestness
sounded
from
above
boat
ahoy
what
boat
is
that
and
promptly
the
helmsman
by
mollys
side
returned
savenaye
st
malo
on
the
instant
the
lights
went
out
there
was
a
creaking
of
block
and
cordage
and
new
ghostly
clouds
rose
over
the
shipsails
loosened
to
the
wind
as
the
skiff
rowers
came
alongside
boathooks
leaped
into
action
and
gripped
the
vessel
an
arm
strong
as
steel
was
held
out
for
the
passenger
as
she
fearlessly
put
her
foot
on
the
ladder
another
a
moment
later
with
masterful
tenderness
bent
round
her
waist
and
she
was
fairly
lifted
on
board
the
peregrine
but
before
her
foot
touched
the
deck
she
felt
upon
her
lips
laid
like
a
burning
seal
a
passionate
kiss
and
her
soul
leaped
up
to
it
as
if
called
into
sudden
life
from
slumber
like
the
princess
of
fairy
lore
she
heard
madeleines
mysterious
lover
whisper
in
her
ear
at
last
oh
what
i
have
suffered
thinking
you
would
not
come
from
the
warm
shelter
of
her
loosened
cloak
the
violets
in
her
bosom
sent
forth
a
wave
of
sweetness
for
a
moment
these
two
were
in
all
creation
alone
to
each
other
while
in
a
circle
the
peregrines
crew
stood
apart
in
respectful
silence
a
broad
grin
of
sympathy
upon
the
mouth
of
every
mothers
son
released
at
last
lady
landale
took
a
trembling
step
on
the
deck
into
what
strange
world
had
she
come
this
night
the
schooner
like
a
mettled
steed
whose
head
is
suddenly
set
free
was
already
in
motion
and
with
gentle
forward
swaying
leaps
rising
to
the
wave
and
gathering
speed
under
her
swelling
sails
captain
jack
had
seized
mollys
hand
and
the
strong
clasp
trembled
round
the
little
fingers
he
said
no
more
to
her
but
in
tones
vibrating
with
emotion
which
all
the
men
now
silently
seeking
their
posts
in
the
darkness
could
hear
my
lads
he
cried
the
lady
is
safe
with
us
after
all
who
shall
say
that
your
skipper
is
not
still
lucky
smith
thank
you
my
good
fellows
now
we
have
yet
to
bring
her
safe
the
other
side
meanwhileno
cheering
lads
you
know
whythere
is
a
hundred
guineas
more
among
you
the
hour
we
make
st
malo
stand
to
every
man
up
with
those
topsails
scarcely
had
the
last
words
been
spoken
when
from
the
offing
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
came
a
longdrawn
hail
faint
through
the
distance
but
yet
fatally
distinct
ahoy
what
schooner
is
that
molly
who
had
not
withdrawn
her
hand
felt
a
shock
pass
over
captain
jacks
frame
he
turned
abruptly
and
she
could
see
him
lean
and
strain
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
the
call
after
an
interval
was
repeated
but
the
outlook
was
impenetrable
and
it
was
weird
indeed
to
feel
that
they
were
seen
yet
could
not
see
molly
standing
close
by
his
side
knew
in
every
fibre
of
her
own
body
that
this
man
to
whom
she
seemed
in
some
inexplicable
fashion
already
linked
was
strongly
moved
nevertheless
she
could
hardly
guess
the
extremity
of
the
passion
that
shook
him
it
was
the
frenzy
of
the
rider
who
feels
his
horse
about
to
fail
him
within
a
span
of
the
winning
post
of
the
leader
whose
men
waver
at
the
actual
point
of
victory
but
the
weakness
of
dismay
was
only
momentary
calm
and
clearness
of
mind
returned
with
the
sense
of
emergency
he
raised
his
nightglass
with
a
steady
hand
this
time
and
scanned
the
depth
of
blackness
in
front
of
him
out
of
it
after
a
moment
there
seemed
to
shape
itself
the
dim
outline
of
a
sail
and
he
knew
that
he
had
waited
too
long
and
had
fallen
in
again
with
the
preventive
cutter
then
glancing
aloft
he
understood
how
it
was
that
the
peregrine
had
been
recognised
the
overcast
sky
had
partly
cleared
to
windward
during
the
last
minutes
a
few
stars
glinted
where
hitherto
nothing
but
the
most
impenetrable
pall
had
hung
in
the
east
the
rays
of
a
yet
invisible
moon
edging
with
faint
silver
the
banks
of
clouds
just
above
the
horizon
had
made
for
the
schooner
a
telltale
background
indeed
on
board
no
sound
was
heard
now
save
the
struggle
of
rope
and
canvas
the
creaking
of
timber
and
the
swift
plashing
rush
of
water
against
her
rounded
sides
as
she
sped
her
course
madeleine
he
said
forcibly
controlling
his
voice
and
bringing
as
he
spoke
his
face
close
to
mollys
to
peer
anxiously
at
its
indistinct
white
oval
we
are
not
free
yet
but
in
a
short
time
with
gods
help
we
shall
have
left
those
intermeddling
fools
yonder
who
would
bar
our
way
miles
out
of
the
running
but
i
cannot
remain
with
you
a
moment
longer
i
must
take
the
helm
myself
oh
forgive
me
for
having
brought
you
to
this
and
should
you
hear
firing
for
heavens
sake
do
not
lose
courage
see
now
i
will
bring
you
to
your
cabin
there
you
will
find
warmth
and
shelter
and
in
a
little
while
a
very
little
while
i
will
return
to
you
to
tell
you
all
is
well
come
my
dearest
love
gently
he
would
have
drawn
her
towards
the
little
deckcabin
guiding
her
steps
as
yet
untutored
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
when
out
of
the
black
chasm
upon
the
weather
bow
of
the
peregrine
leaped
forth
a
yellow
tongue
of
light
fringed
with
red
and
encircled
by
a
ruddy
cloud
and
three
seconds
later
the
boom
of
a
gun
broke
with
a
dull
ominous
clangour
above
the
wrangling
of
sea
and
wind
molly
straightened
herself
what
is
that
she
asked
the
warning
gun
he
answered
hurriedly
to
say
that
they
mean
to
see
who
we
are
and
that
if
we
do
not
stop
the
next
will
be
shotted
time
presses
madeleine
go
infear
nothing
we
shall
soon
be
on
their
other
side
out
of
sight
in
darkness
again
i
shall
stop
with
you
let
no
thought
of
me
hinder
you
i
am
not
afraid
i
want
to
see
at
these
words
the
lover
was
struck
with
a
surprise
that
melted
into
a
proud
and
new
joy
he
had
loved
madeleine
for
her
womans
grace
and
her
womans
heart
now
he
told
himself
he
must
worship
her
also
for
her
brave
soul
but
this
was
no
time
for
useless
words
it
was
not
more
unsafe
for
her
on
deck
than
in
the
cabin
and
at
the
thought
of
her
beside
him
during
the
coming
struggle
the
strength
of
a
god
rose
within
him
come
he
answered
briefly
and
moved
with
her
to
the
helm
which
a
sailor
silently
surrendered
to
him
whilst
she
steadied
herself
by
holding
to
the
binnaclethe
only
place
on
board
at
that
time
where
from
sheer
necessity
any
light
had
been
allowed
to
remain
it
was
faint
enough
but
the
reflection
from
the
compassboard
as
he
bent
to
examine
it
was
sufficient
to
make
just
visible
with
a
dim
fantastic
glow
the
strong
beauty
of
his
face
and
put
a
flash
into
each
wide
dilated
eye
and
thus
did
molly
for
the
first
time
see
captain
jack
she
sank
down
at
the
foot
of
the
binnacle
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
as
if
hugging
the
new
rapture
as
closely
to
her
as
she
could
and
looking
up
at
the
alert
figure
before
her
which
she
now
began
to
discern
more
clearly
under
the
lightening
sky
at
the
face
which
she
divined
although
she
could
only
see
the
watchful
gleam
of
the
eyes
as
now
and
again
they
sought
her
down
in
the
shadow
at
his
feet
she
felt
herself
kindle
in
answer
to
the
glow
of
his
glorious
lifeenergy
they
were
going
side
by
side
this
young
hero
of
romance
and
she
to
fight
their
way
through
some
unknown
peril
madeleine
my
sweet
bride
my
brave
love
they
are
about
to
fire
again
and
this
time
you
will
hear
the
shot
burring
but
be
not
afraid
it
will
strike
ahead
of
us
another
flash
sprang
out
of
the
night
much
nearer
this
time
and
louder
for
it
belched
forth
a
shot
which
ploughed
its
way
in
the
water
across
the
schooners
bow
i
am
not
afraid
said
molly
again
and
she
laughed
a
little
fierce
nervous
laugh
they
are
between
us
and
the
open
sea
thus
far
the
luck
is
on
their
side
had
you
come
but
half
an
hour
sooner
madeleine
we
should
be
running
as
free
as
any
kings
ship
now
they
think
no
doubt
they
will
drive
me
on
to
the
sand
but
he
tossed
back
his
head
with
a
superb
gesture
there
is
no
power
from
heaven
or
hell
that
can
keep
me
out
of
my
course
tonight
by
this
time
the
preventive
cutter
was
faintly
discernible
two
cables
length
on
the
larboard
bow
there
came
another
haila
loud
husky
bellow
from
over
the
water
schooner
ahoy
heave
to
or
well
sink
you
madeleine
said
captain
jack
come
closer
to
me
lie
down
behind
me
quickthe
next
shot
will
be
in
my
rigging
heave
towith
my
treasures
my
bride
on
board
and
a
ten
knot
breeze
and
he
looked
down
at
molly
laughing
in
his
contempt
then
he
shouted
some
order
which
brought
the
peregrine
some
points
more
off
the
wind
and
she
bounded
forward
with
renewed
zest
sink
us
why
dont
you
fire
now
you
lubbers
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
to
see
the
beacon
of
scarthey
straight
over
the
stern
you
have
got
us
in
line
with
the
light
and
thats
your
last
chance
in
another
minute
i
shall
be
past
you
ah
i
can
see
you
now
my
fine
fellowscourage
madeleine
to
molly
of
course
his
words
conveyed
no
meaning
except
that
the
critical
moment
had
come
that
the
ship
which
carried
her
flying
upon
the
water
like
a
living
thing
eager
yet
obedient
in
all
its
motions
to
the
guiding
will
of
the
man
beside
her
was
rushing
to
the
fray
the
thought
fired
her
soul
and
she
sprang
up
to
look
over
the
side
what
she
exclaimed
for
the
little
cutter
on
close
quarters
looked
insignificant
indeed
by
the
side
of
the
noble
vessel
that
so
scornfully
bore
down
on
her
is
that
all
they
have
a
gun
and
we
have
none
answered
captain
jack
down
madeleine
down
behind
in
the
name
of
god
why
should
i
crouch
if
you
stand
up
the
mans
heart
swelled
within
him
but
as
he
looked
with
proud
admiration
at
the
cloaked
and
hooded
figure
by
his
side
the
cutters
gun
fired
for
the
third
time
with
roar
and
hiss
the
shot
came
over
the
bow
of
the
schooner
as
she
dipped
into
the
trough
and
raking
the
deck
crashed
through
her
side
on
the
quarter
molly
gave
a
shriek
and
staggered
a
fearful
malediction
burst
from
captain
jacks
lips
he
left
the
tiller
and
sprang
to
her
one
of
the
hands
believing
his
skipper
to
have
been
struck
ran
to
the
helm
and
again
put
the
vessel
on
her
proper
course
which
a
few
moments
later
was
to
make
her
shoot
past
the
revenue
cutter
wounded
madeleine
wounded
through
my
fault
by
the
living
god
they
shall
pay
for
this
oh
groaned
molly
something
has
cut
me
in
the
arm
and
shoulder
then
rapidly
gathering
composure
but
its
not
much
i
can
move
it
at
one
glance
the
sailor
saw
from
the
position
of
the
shot
hole
in
the
vessels
side
that
the
wound
could
only
have
been
made
by
a
splinter
but
the
possibility
of
exposing
his
beloved
to
such
another
risk
was
not
to
be
bornea
murderous
rush
of
blood
flew
to
his
brain
the
cutter
perceiving
the
tactics
of
the
swifter
schooner
was
now
tacking
about
with
the
intention
of
bringing
the
gun
to
bear
upon
her
once
more
as
she
attempted
to
slip
by
but
captain
jack
in
his
newfanned
fury
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
desperate
cast
of
the
die
starboard
hard
a
starboard
he
called
out
in
a
voice
that
his
men
had
known
well
in
old
fighting
days
and
which
was
heard
as
far
as
the
cutter
itself
they
shall
not
fire
that
gun
again
with
a
brief
starboard
it
is
sir
the
man
who
had
taken
the
helm
brought
the
ship
round
and
the
silent
active
crew
in
a
trice
were
ready
to
go
about
majestically
the
schooner
changed
her
course
and
as
the
meaning
of
the
manoeuvre
became
fearfully
apparent
shouts
and
oaths
arose
in
confusion
from
the
cutter
what
are
you
going
to
do
eagerly
asked
molly
enthralled
by
the
superb
motion
of
the
vessel
under
her
foot
as
it
swept
round
and
increased
speed
upon
the
new
tack
he
held
her
in
his
arms
his
hand
had
sought
her
wounded
shoulder
and
pressed
the
lacerated
spot
in
his
effort
to
staunch
the
precious
blood
that
rose
warm
through
the
cloth
torturing
his
cold
fingers
i
am
going
to
clear
those
men
from
our
way
to
freedom
and
to
love
i
am
going
to
sink
that
boat
they
shall
pay
with
their
lives
for
this
come
to
the
other
side
madeleine
and
watch
how
my
stout
peregrine
sweeps
our
courseand
then
i
may
see
how
these
scoundrels
have
mangled
you
my
love
but
nay
this
is
no
sight
for
you
hold
on
close
to
me
sweet
and
hide
your
eyes
while
they
go
he
steadied
himself
firmly
with
one
hand
on
the
rigging
now
musket
shots
flashed
on
board
the
cutter
in
quick
succession
and
sundry
balls
whizzed
over
the
poop
intended
for
the
helmsman
by
their
side
captain
jack
gnashed
his
teeth
as
the
menacing
drone
of
one
of
them
came
perilously
close
to
the
beloved
head
by
his
cheek
look
out
every
man
well
run
her
down
he
called
his
voice
was
like
the
blast
of
bugles
cheers
broke
out
from
every
part
of
the
ship
drowning
the
yells
of
execration
and
the
shouts
of
fear
from
below
and
now
with
irresistible
sway
the
rushing
peregrine
heavy
and
powerful
was
closing
and
bearing
down
upon
her
frailer
enemy
there
was
a
spell
of
suspense
when
all
was
silence
save
the
rush
and
turmoil
of
the
waters
and
the
flapping
of
the
cutters
sails
helpless
for
the
moment
in
the
teeth
of
the
breeze
like
a
charging
steed
the
schooner
seemed
to
leap
at
her
foe
then
came
the
shock
there
was
a
brief
check
in
her
career
she
rose
by
the
head
the
rigging
strained
and
sighed
the
masts
swayed
groaning
but
stood
over
the
bows
in
the
darkness
was
heard
a
longdrawn
crash
was
seen
a
white
wall
of
foaming
water
rising
silently
to
break
the
next
moment
with
a
great
roar
the
cutter
struck
obliquely
amidships
was
thrown
straightway
on
her
beam
ends
the
peregrine
with
every
sail
spread
and
swollen
held
her
as
the
preying
bird
with
outstretched
wings
holds
its
quarry
and
pressed
her
down
until
she
began
to
fill
and
settle
it
was
with
wideopen
eyes
with
eager
throbbing
heart
that
molly
watched
it
all
lights
my
lads
cried
captain
jack
with
a
shout
of
exultation
when
the
anxious
instant
had
passed
take
in
every
man
you
can
save
but
handspike
is
the
word
for
the
first
who
shows
fight
curwen
do
you
get
her
clear
again
all
around
upon
the
deck
sprang
rumour
and
turmoil
came
shouts
and
sounds
of
scuffling
and
the
rushing
of
feet
from
the
blank
waters
came
piteous
calls
for
help
but
paying
little
heed
to
aught
but
molly
captain
jack
seized
a
lighted
lantern
from
the
hands
of
a
passing
sailor
and
drew
her
aside
fevered
with
pain
and
fascinated
by
the
horror
of
fight
and
deaths
doings
yet
instinctively
remembering
to
pull
her
hood
over
her
face
she
allowed
herself
to
be
taken
into
the
little
deck
cabin
he
placed
the
lantern
upon
the
table
rest
here
he
said
quickly
once
more
striving
to
see
her
beneath
the
jealous
shade
i
must
find
out
if
anything
is
amiss
on
board
the
ship
and
attend
to
these
drowning
meneven
before
you
my
darling
but
i
shall
be
back
instantly
you
are
not
faint
the
light
shone
full
on
his
features
which
molly
eagerly
scanned
from
her
safe
recess
when
she
met
his
eyes
full
of
the
triumph
of
love
and
hope
her
soul
broke
into
fierce
revoltagain
she
felt
upon
her
lips
that
kiss
of
young
passionate
love
that
had
been
the
first
her
life
had
ever
known

and
might
be
the
last
for
the
disclosure
was
approaching
apace
she
was
glad
of
the
respite
go
she
said
with
as
much
firmness
as
she
could
muster
let
me
not
stand
between
you
and
your
duty

had
he
had
time
to
wonder

for
aught
but
his
love
thoughts
and
his
fury
as
he
dashed
back
again
panting
for
the
moment
when
he
could
have
her
to
himself

no

have
three
of
the
cutters
men
on

already
they
swarmed
over
the
bows
one
had
his
cutlass
out
and
had
the
devils
impudence
to
claim
the
schooner

brought
him
to

to

round

up

the
thought
illumined
his
brain
with
glory
as

rushed
back
to
the
silent
muffled
figure

still
stood
awaiting

coming

selfish
brute
that
i

you
must
be
crushed
with

womans

the

had
begun
to
roll
more
wildlyhe
led
her
back
into
the
little
room
now
lighted
by
the
fitful
rays
of
a
swinging
lamp
with
head
averted
she
suffered
herself
to
be
seated
on
a
kind
of
sofa
couch
when
he
had
closed
the
door
he
seized
her
hand
on
which
ran
streaks
of
halfdried
blood
and
covered
it
with
kisses
ah
madeleine
here
in
the
sanctuary
i
had
prepared
for
you
where
i

safe
so
guarded

fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
madeleine
my
wife
you
must
let
me
tend
you
then
as
she
shivered
slightly
but
did
not
turn
to
him
he
went
on
in
tones
of
the
most
restrained
tenderness
mingled
with
humblest
pleading
had
it
not
been
for
your
accident
i
had
not
ventured
even
to
cross
the
threshold
of
this
room
but
your
wound
must
be
dressed

darling
allow
me
forgive
me
the
risk
is
too
great
rising
to
his
feet
again
he
gently
pulled
at
her
cloak
molly
spoke
not
a
word
but
untied
it
at
the
neck
and
let
it
fall
away
from
her
fair
young
body
and
keeping
her
hooded
face
still
rigidly
averted
she
surrendered
her
wounded
arm
he
muttered
words
of
distress
at
the
sight
of
the
broad
blood
stains
stepped
hurriedly
to
a
little
cupboard
where
such
surgical
stores
as
might
be
required
on
board
were
hoarded
and
having
selected
scissors
lint
and
bandages
came
back
and
again
knelt
down
by
her
side
to
cut
off
with
eager
compassionate
hands
the
torn
and
maculated
sleeve
the
wound
was
but
a
surface
laceration
and
a
man
would
not
have
given
a
thought
to
it
in
the
circumstances
but
to
see
this
soft
white
womans
skin
bruised
black
in
parts
torn
with
a
horrid
red
gap
in
others
to
see
the
beauty
of
this
round
arm
thus
brutally
marred
thus
twitching
with
painit
was
monstrous
hideously
unnatural
in
the
lovers
eyes
with
tenderness
but
unflinchingly
he
laved
the
mangled
skin
with
cool
fresh
water
pulled
out
with
far
greater
torture
to
himself
than
to
her
some
remaining
splinters
embedded
in
the
flesh
covered
the
wound
with
lint
and
finished
the
operation
by
a
bandage
as
neat
as
his
neat
sailors
touch
coupled
with
some
knowledge
of
surgery
gained
in
the
experiences
of
his
privateering
days
could
accomplish
it
he
spoke
little
only
a
word
of
encouragement
of
admiration
for
her
fortitude
now
and
then
and
she
spoke
not
at
all
during
the
ministration
she
had
raised
her
other
hand
to
her
eyes
with
a
gesture
natural
to
one
bracing
herself
to
endurance
and
had
kept
it
there
until
his
task
completed
her
silence
the
manner
in
which
she
hid
her
face
from
him
awoke
in
him
all
that
was
best
and
loftiest
in
his
generous
heart
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
before
her
he
too
dared
not
speak
for
fear
of
bruising
what
he
deemed
an
exquisite
maidenliness
before
which
his
manhood
was
abashed
at
itself
for
some
moments
there
was
no
sound
in
the
cabin
save
that
of
the
swift
rushing
waters
behind
the
wooden
walls
and
of
the
labour
and
life
of
the
ship
under
full
sail
then
he
saw
the
tumultuous
rising
of
her
bosom
and
thought
she
was
weeping
madeleine
he
cried
with
passionate
anxiety
speak
let
me
see
your
faceare
you
faint
lie
upon
this
couch
let
me
get
you
wineoh
that
these
days
were
passed
and
i
could
call
you
wife
and
never
leave
you
madeleine
my
love
speak
molly
rose
to
her
feet
and
with
a
gesture
of
anger
threw
off
her
hood
and
turned
round
upon
him
and
there
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
he
glared
like
one
distraught
at
the
raven
locks
the
burning
eyes
of
a
strange
woman
she
was
very
pale
no
said
molly
defiantly
when
twice
or
thrice
his
laboured
breath
had
marked
the
passing
of
the
horrible
moment
i
am
not
madeleine
then
she
tried
to
smile
but
unconsciously
she
was
frightened
and
the
smile
died
unformed
as
she
pursued
at
random
you
know
meperhaps
by
hearsayas
i
know
you
captain
smith
but
he
shivering
under
the
coldness
of
his
disappointment
answered
in
a
kind
of
weary
whisper
who
are
youyou
who
speak
with
her
voice
who
stand
at
her
height
and
move
and
walk
as
she
does
i
have
seen
you
surelyah
i
know
madam
what
a
cruel
mockery
and
she
where
is
she
still
staring
at
her
with
widely
dilated
eyes
he
seized
his
forehead
between
his
hands
the
gesture
was
one
of
utter
despair
before
this
weakness
molly
promptly
resumed
the
superiority
of
selfpossession
yes
she
said
and
this
time
the
smile
came
back
to
her
face
i
am
lady
landale
and
my
sister

grieve
to
have
to
say
sohas
not
had
that
courage
for
which
you
gave
her
credit
tonight
little
was
required
at
a
moment
like
this
to
transmute
such
thoughts
as
seethed
in
the
mans
head
to
a
burst
of
fury
fury
is
action
and
action
a
relief
to
the
strained
heart
there
was
a
halfconcealed
unintended
mockery
in
her
tones
which
brought
a
sudden
fire
of
anger
to
his
eyes
he
raised
both
hands
and
shook
them
fiercely
above
his
head
but
whywhy
in
the
name
of
heavenhas
such
a
trick
been
played
on
me

at
such
a
time
he
paused
and
trembling
with
the
effort
restrained
himself
to
a
more
decent
bearing
before
the
woman
the
lady
the
friends
wife
his
arms
fell
by
his
side
and
he
repeated
in
lower
tones
though
the
flame
of
his
gaze
could
not
be
subdued
why
this
deception
this
playing
with
the
blindness
of
my
love
why
this
comedy
which
has
already
had
one
act
so
tragicyes
think
of
it
madam
think
of
the
tragedy
this
is
now
in
my
life
since
she
is
left
behind
and
i
never
now
with
these
mens
lives
to
account
for
may
go
back
and
claim
her
who
has
given
me
her
troth
already
i
staked
the
fortune
of
my
trust
on
the
bare
chance
that
she
would
come
what
though
her
heart
failed
her
at
the
eleventh
hourgod
forgive
her
for
itsurely
she
never
sanctioned
this
masquerade
oh
no
she
would
not
stoop
to
such
an
act
and
human
life
is
not
a
thing
to
jest
upon
she
never
played
this
trick
the
thought
is
too
odious

half
an

corpses

rolling
under
the
wave
with

sunken
ship

still
be
live
men
and
warm
and
ii
should
not

the
hopeless
outlaw
the
actual
murderer
that
this
nights
work
has
made
of
me
his
voice
by
degrees
rose
once
more
to
the
utmost
ring
of
bitterness
and
anger
molly
who
had
restored
her
cloak
to
her
shoulders
and
sat
down
ensconced
in
it
as
closely
as
her
swaddled
arm
would
allow
her
contemplated
him
with
a
curious
mixture
of
delight
and
terror
delight
in
his
vigour
his
beauty
above
everything
in
his
mastery
and
strength
and
delight
again
at
the
new
thrill
of
the
fear
it
imposed
upon
her
daring
soul
then
she
flared
into
rage
at
the
thought
of
the
coward
of
her
blood
who
had
broken
faith
with
such
a
man
as
this
and
she
melted
all
into
sympathy
with
his
angera
right
proper
man
most
cruelly
used
and
most
justifiably
wrathful
and
she
being
a
woman
whose
face
was
at
most
times
as
a
book
on
which
to
read
the
working
of
her
soul
there
was
something
in
her
look
as
in
silence
she
listened
and
gazed
upon
him
which
struck
him
suddenly
dumb
such
a
look
on
a
face
so
like
yet
so
unlike
that
of
his
love
was
startling
in
the
extremehorrible
he
stepped
back
and
made
as
if
he
would
have
rushed
from
the
room
then
bethinking
himself
that
he
was
a
madman
he
drew
a
chair
near
her
in
a
contrary
mood
sat
down
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
very
steadily
she
dropped
her
long
lids
and
demurely
composed
her
features
by
some
instinct
that
women
have
rather
than
from
any
sense
of
the
impression
she
had
produced
a
little
while
they
sat
thus
again
in
silence
in
the
silence
the
rolling
of
the
ship
and
the
manner
in
which
as
she
raced
on
her
way
she
seemed
to
breathe
and
strain
worked
in
with
the
mood
of
each
in
his
with
the
storm
and
stress
of
his
soul
in
hers
as
the
very
expression
of
her
new
freedom
and
reckless
pleasure
then
he
spoke
the
strong
emotion
that
had
warmed
her
had
now
left
his
voice
it
was
cold
and
scornful
madam
i
await
your
explanation
so
far
i
find
myself
only
the
victim
of
a
trick
as
unworthy
and
cruel
as
it
is
purposeless
she
had
delayed
carrying
out
her
mission
with
the
most
definite
perverseness
she
could
not
but
acknowledge
the
justice
of
his
reproof
realise
the
sorry
part
she
must
play
in
his
eyes
the
inexcusable
folly
of
the
whole
proceeding
and
yet
she
was
strung
to
a
very
lively
indignation
by
the
tone
he
had
assumed
and
suddenly
saw
herself
in
the
light
of
a
most
disinterested
and
injured
virtue
captain
smith
she
exclaimed
flashing
a
hot
glance
at
him
you
assume
strangely
the
right
to
be
angry
with
me
be
angry
if
you
will
with
things
as
they
are
rail
against
fate
if
you
will
but
be
grateful
to
mei
have
risked
much
to
serve
you
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
changed
abruptly
to
one
of
eager
almost
entreating
inquiry
do
me
the
favour
she
continued
to
look
into
the
pocket
of
my
cloakmy
arm
hurts
me
if
i
moveyou
will
find
there
a
letter
addressed
to
you
i
was
adjured
to
see
that
it
should
reach
you
in
safety
i
promised
to
place
it
in
your
own
hands
this
could
hardly
have
been
done
sooner
as
you
know
the
words
all
at
once
seemed
to
alter
the
whole
situation
he
sprang
up
and
came
to
her
quickly
oh
forgive
me
make
allowances
for
me
lady
landale
i
am
quite
distracted
there
had
returned
a
tinge
of
hope
into
his
voice
where
is
it
he
eagerly
asked
seeking
as
directed
for
the
pocket
ah
and
mechanically
repeating
forgive
me
he
drew
out
the
letter
at
last
and
retreated
feverishly
opening
it
under
the
light
of
the
lamp
molly
had
turned
round
to
watch
up
to
this
she
had
felt
no
regret
for
his
disillusion
only
an
irritable
heat
of
temper
that
he
should
waste
so
much
love
upon
so
poor
an
object
but
now
all
her
heart
went
to
him
as
she
saw
the
sudden
greyness
that
fell
on
his
face
from
the
reading
of
the
very
first
line
there
was
no
indignation
no
bloodstirring
emotion
it
was
as
if
a
cold
pall
had
fallen
upon
his
generous
spirit
the
very
room
looked
darker
when
the
fire
within
the
brave
soul
was
thus
all
of
a
sudden
extinguished
he
read
on
slowly
with
a
kind
of
dull
obstinacy
and
when
he
came
to
the
miserable
end
continued
looking
at
the
paper
for
the
moment
then
his
hand
fell
slowly
the
letter
fluttered
to
the
floor
and
he
let
his
eyes
rest
unseeingly
wonderingly
upon
the
messenger
after
a
little
while
words
broke
from
him
toneless
the
mere
echo
of
dazed
thoughts
it
is
over
all
over
she
has
lost
her
trust
she
does
not
love
me
any
more
he
picked
up
the
letter
again
and
sitting
down
placed
it
in
front
of
him
on
the
table
tis
a
cruel
letter
madam
that
you
have
brought
me
he
said
then
looking
up
at
molly
with
the
most
extraordinary
pain
in
his
eyes
a
cruel
letter
yet
i
am
the
same
man
now
that
i
was
this
morning
when
she
swore
she
would
trust
me
to
the
endand
she
could
not
trust
me
a
few
hours
longer
why
did
you
not
speak
one
word
from
you
as
you
stepped
upon
the
ship
would
have
saved
my
soul
from
the
guilt
of
these
mens
death
then
with
a
sharper
uplifting
of
his
voice
as
a
new
aspect
of
his
misfortune
struck
him
and
youyou
too
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
adrians
wife
he
does
not
know
she
did
not
reply
and
he
cried
out
clapping
his
hands
together
it
only
wanted
this
my
god
it
is
ii
his
friend
who
owes
him
so
much
who
am
to
cause
him
such
fear
such
misery
do
you
know
madam
that
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
restore
you
to
him
for
days
yet
and
then
when
and
where
and
how
god
knows
nothing
must
now
come
between
me
and
my
trust
i
have
already
dishonourably
endangered
it
to
attempt
to
return
with
you
tonight
as
perhaps
you
fancy
i
willas
of
course
i
would
instantly
do
had
i
alone
myself
and
you
to
consider
would
be
little
short
of
madness
it
would
mean
utter
ruin
to
many
whom
i
have
pledged
myself
to
serve
and
yet
adrianmy
honour
pulls
me
two
wayspoor
adrian
what
dumb
devil
possessed
you
that
you
did
not
speak
before
had
you
no

he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
lady
landale
flushed
and
paled
alternately
parted
her
lips
to
speak
and
closed
them
once
more
what
could
she
say
and
how
excuse
herself
she
did
not
repent
what
she
had
done
though
it
had
been
sin
all
round
she
had
little
reck
of
her
womans
good
name
as
he
called
it
the
death
of
the
excise
men
weighed
but
lightly
if
at
all
upon
her
conscience
the
thought
of
adrian
was
only
then
a
distasteful
memory
to
be
thrust
away
nayeven
this
mans
grief
could
not
temper
the
wild
joy
that
was
in
her
soul
tonight
fevered
with
fatigue
with
excitement
by
her
wound
her
blood
ran
burning
in
her
veins
and
beat
faster
in
every
pulse
and
as
she
felt
the
ship
rise
and
fall
and
knew
that
each
motion
was
an
onward
leap
that
separated
her
further
and
ever
further
from
dull
home
and
dull
husband
and
isolated
her
ever
more
completely
with
her
sisters
lover
she
exulted
in
her
heart
presently
he
lifted
his
head
forgive
me
he
said
i
believe
that
you
meant
most
kindly
and
as
you
say
i
should
be
grateful
your
service
is
illrequited
by
my
reproaches
and
you
have
run
risk
indeedmerciful
heaven
had
my
old
friends
wife
been
killed
upon
my
ship
through
my
doings
but
you
see
i
cannot
command
myself
you
see
how
i
am
situated
you
must
forgive
me
all
that
can
be
done
to
restore
you
to
your
home
as
soon
as
possible
shall
be
done
and
all
meanwhile
to
mitigate
the
discomfort
you
must
suffer
hereand
for
your
good
intention
to
her
and
me
i
thank
you
he
had
risen
and
now
bowed
with
a
dignity
that
sat
on
his
sailor
freedom
in
no
wise
awkwardly
she
too
with
an
effort
stood
up
as
if
to
arrest
his
imminent
departure
a
tall
woman
and
he
but
of
average
height
their
eyes
were
nearly
on
a
level
for
a
second
or
two
her
dark
gaze
sought
his
with
a
strange
hesitation
and
then
as
if
the
truth
in
him
awoke
all
the
truth
in
her
the
natural
daring
of
her
spirit
rose
proudly
to
meet
this
kindred
soul
she
would
let
no
falsehood
no
craven
feminine
subterfuge
intervene
between
them
do
not
thank
me
she
exclaimed
glowing
with
a
brilliant
scorn
in
which
the
greatness
of
her
beauty
all
worn
as
she
was
struck
him
into
surprise
yet
evoked
no
spark
of
admiration
what
i
did
i
did
to
gratify
myself
oh
aye
if
i
were
as
other
women
i
should
smile
and
take
your
compliments
and
pose
as
the
martyr
and
as
the
selfsacrificing
devoted
sister
but
i
will
not
it
was
nothing
to
me
how
madeleine
got
in
or
out
of
her
love
scrapes
i
would
not
have
gone
one
step
to
help
her
break
her
promise
to
you
or
even
to
save
your
life
but
that
it
pleased
me
so
to
do
madeleine
has
never
chosen
to
make
me
her
confidant
i
would
have
let
her
manage
her
own
affairs
gaily
had
i
had
better
things
to
occupy
my
mindbut
i
had
not
captain
smith
life
at
pulwick
is
monotonous
i
have
roaming
blood
in
my
veins
the
adventure
tempted
amused
me
fascinated
meand
there
you
have
the
truth
of
course
i
could
have
given
the
letter
to
the
men
and
sent
them
back
to
you
with
itit
was
not
because
of
my
promise
that
i
did
not
do
it
of
course
i
could
have
spoken
the
instant
i
got
on
board
perhaps
here
a
flood
of
colour
dyed
her
face
with
a
gorgeous
conscious
crimson
and
a
dimple
faintly
came
and
went
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
perhaps
i
would
have
spoken
but
then
you
must
remember
you
closed
my
lips
my
god
said
captain
jack
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
horror
but
this
she
could
not
see
for
her
eyes
were
downcast
and
now
that
i
have
come
she
went
on
and
would
have
added
i
am
glad
i
did
but
that
all
of
a
sudden
a
new
bashfulness
came
upon
her
and
she
stammered
instead
incoherently
as
for
adrianren
knew
i
had
a
message
for
you
and
ren
will
tell
himhe
is
not
stupidyou
knowren
i
mean
i
am
glad
answered
the
man
gravely
after
a
pause
if
you
have
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
your
husband
knows
you
to
be
on
my
ship
he
will
then
be
the
less
anxious
at
your
disappearance
for
he
knows
too
madam
that
his
wife
will
be
as
honoured
and
as
guarded
in
my
charge
as
she
would
be
in
her
mothers
house
he
bowed
again
in
a
stately
way
and
then
immediately
left
her
molly
sank
back
upon
her
couch
and
she
could
not
have
said
why
burst
into
tears
she
felt
cold
now
and
broken
and
her
stiffening
wound
pained
her
but
nevertheless
as
she
lay
upon
the
little
velvet
pillow
and
wept
her
rare
tears
were
strangling
sobs
the
very
ache
of
her
wound
had
a
strange
savour
that
she
would
not
have
exchanged
for
any
past
content





ren
having
obeyed
his
mistresss
orders
and
left
her
alone
with
the
sailors
on
the
beach
withdrew
within
the
shelter
of
the
door
but
remained
waiting
near
enough
to
be
at
hand
in
case
he
should
be
called
it
was
still
pitch
dark
and
the
rollers
growled
under
a
rough
wind
he
could
catch
the
sound
of
a
mans
voice
now
and
again
between
the
clamour
of
the
sea
and
the
wuthering
of
the
air
but
could
not
distinguish
a
word
presently
however
this
ceased
and
there
came
to
him
the
unmistakable
regular
beat
of
oars
retreating
the
interview
was
over
and
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
thought
that
at
last
his
masters
friend
would
soon
be
setting
on
his
way
to
safety
the
servant
emerged
to
seek
her
ladyship
a
few
minutes
later
he
dashed
into
sir
adrians
room
with
a
livid
face
and
poured
forth
a
confused
tale
milady
had
landed
without
mademoiselle
had
stopped
to
speak
to
two
of
the
peregrine
whilst
he
waited
apart
the
men
had
departed
in
their
boat
the
peregrine
men
but
the
ship
has
been
out
of
sight

eight
hours
ejaculated
sir
adrian
bewildered
then
catching
fear
from
his
servants
distraught
countenance
my
wife
he
exclaimed
bounding
up
and
added

the
man
struck
his
breast

had
searched
and
called

repeated

said
sir
adrian
the
anguish
of
a
greater
dread
driving
the
blood
to
his
heart
even
to
one
who
knew
the
ground
well
the
isle
of
scarthey
on
a
black
stormy
night
with
the
tide
high
was
no
safe
wandering
ground
for
a
moment
the
twocomrades
of
so
many
miserable
hoursfaced
each
other
with
white
and
haggard
faces
then
with
the
same
deadly
fear
in
their
hearts
they
hurried
out
into
the
soughing

can

why

yonder
upon
the

that

the

your
honour
i
must
avow
to
you
that
i
have
concealed
something
from
youit
was
wrong
indeed
and
now
i
am
punishedbut
that
poor
monsieur
the
captain
i
was
so
sorry
for
him
and
he
so
enamoured
he
had
made
a
plan
to
lift
off
mademoiselle
madeleine
with
him
tonight
marry
her
in
france
and
that
was
why
he
came
back
again
at
the
risk
of
his
life
he
supplicated
me
not
to
tell
you
for
fear
you
would
wish
to
prevent
it
or
think
it
your
duty
to
mademoiselle
had
promised
it
seemed
and
he
was
mad
with
her
joy
the
poor
gentleman
and
as
sure
of
her
faith
as
if
she
had
been
a
saint
in
heaven
but
my
lady
came
alone
your
honour
as
i
said
the
courage
had
failed
to
mademoiselle
i
suppose
at
the
last
moment
and
madame
bore
a
message
to
the
captain
but
the
captain
was
not
able
to
leave
his
ship
it
seems
and
my
faith
cried
mr
potter
his
spirits
rising
as
the
first
ghastly
dread
left
him
the
mystery
explains
itself
it
is
quite
simple
your
honour
will
see
as
the
captain
did
not
come
to
the
island
according
to
his
promise
to
mademoisellehe
had
good
reasons
no

went
herself
to

her

the

if
mademoiselle

a
little
of
it
tonight
we
should
not

we

sir

caught
at
the
suggestion
out
of
the
depths
of
his
despair
you
are
right

you
must
be
right

this
black

instantly
and
let
us
row
for
those
lights
as
we
never
rowed
before
even
as
the
words
were
uttered
the
treble
glimmer
vanished
in
vain
they
strained
their
eyes
save
for
the
luminous
streak
cast
by
their
own
beacon

the
gloom
was
unbroken
his

will
see
a

be

instantly
with
my

safe
and
sound
said
ren
at
last
but
his
voice
lacked
confidence
and
sir
adrian
groaned
aloud
and
so
they
stood
alone
in
silence
forced
into
inaction
that
most
cruel
addition
to
suspense
by
the
darkness
and
the
waters
which
hemmed
them
in
upon
every
side
the
vision
of
twenty
dangerous
places
where
one
impetuous
footfall
might
have
hurled
his
darling
into

cruel
beating

at
the

also
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
wild
cry
it
seemed
as
if
the
wind
caught
it
from
him
and
tore
it
into
shreds
hark
whispered
ren
and
clasped
his
masters
icy
hand
like
an
echo
of
sir

cry
the
faroff

the

peered
outward
as

from
the
gliding
spectre

seemed
as
if
the
night
suddenly
opened
on

to
shoot
forth
a
burst
of

in

scanned
afresh
the

knelt
down
and
gazed
at
the
last
little
imprint
that
seemed
to
mock
him
with
the
same
elusive
daintiness
as
molly

as
if

could
draw
from
it

down

strove
by
thumping
his
breast
vigorously
to
infuse
a
little
warmth
into
his
numbed
limbs
and
at
the
same
time
to
relieve
his
overcharged
feelings
as
he
paused
at
length
out
of
breath
the
noise
of
a
methodical
thud
and
splash
of
oars

above

in
the
excess
of
the
sudden
joy

waving
his

he
sent
forth
a

up

a

sir
adrian
unable
to
restrain
his
impatience
ran
forward
too
and
threw
the
light
of
his
lantern
upon
the
dark
figures
now
rising
one
by
one
and
pressing
forward
five

six
men
drenched
from
head

and
grumbling
with
faces
pinched
with
cold
all
lowering
with
the

expression
of
anger
and
resentment
and
shining
whitely
at
him
out
of
the
confusion
he
saw

emptying
seats
the
shipped
oars
the
name

in
black
letters
upon
the
white
paint

she
she
was
not
there
the
revulsion
of

was
so
cruel
that
for
a
while
he
seemed
turned
to
stone
even
his
mind
becoming
blank
the

lashed
in
up
to
his

never

him
away

then
rens

in

whisper
close
to

aroused
him

they

and
they
were
after
the

but
he
ran
down
their
cutter
that
brave
captain
and
these
are
all
that
were
saved
from
her
for
she
sank
like
a

the
peregrine
is
as
sound
as
a
bell
they
sayah
she
is
a
good
ship
and
the
captain
out
of
his
kind
heart
sent
these
villains
ashore
in
his
own
boat
instead
of
braining
them
or
throwing
them
overboard
but
they
saw
a
lady
beside
him
the
whole
time
tall
in
a
great
black
cloak
my

would
have
compromised

his

it
is

the

the

above

the

her
way
through
a

the
ceaseless
fatigue
and

thirtysix

to

of
the
swinging
canvas
the
usual
vigour
of
life
coursing
through
every
fibre
of
him
he
fell
to
wondering
in
halfawake
fashion
at
the
meaning
of
the
unwonted
weight
lurking
in
some
back
recess
of
consciousness

memory
the
ruthless
arose
and
buffeted

soul
the
one
thing
had
failed
him
without
which
all
else
was
as
nothing
fate
and
his
own
hot
blood
had
conspired
to
place
his
hearts

beyond
all
reasonable
hope
certain
phrases
in

crossed
and
recrossed
his

bringing
now
an
unwonted
sting
of
anger
now
the
old
cruel
pain
of
last
night
the
thought
of
the
hateful
complication
introduced
into
his
already
sufficiently
involved
affairs
by
the
involuntary
kidnapping
of
his
friends
wife
filled
him
with
a
sense
of
impotent
irritation
very
foreign
to
his
temper
and
as
certain
looks
and
words
of
the
unwishedfor
prisoner
flashed
back
upon
him
a
hot
colour
rose
even
in
his
solitude
to
his
wholesome
brown
cheek
but
in
spite
of
all
in
spite
of
reason
and
feeling
alike
his
essential
buoyancy
asserted
itself
he
could
not
despair
he

not
been
given

vigour
of

down

for
the
poor
of

up
while
it
was

to
act
his
fair
ship

speeding
with
him
as
he
loved
to
feel
her

him
spread
the
vast

in

his

vaulted

the
full
air
of
the
open
the
brisk
dash
of
the

filled
him
with
physical
exhilaration
at
every
breath
and
tingled
in
his
veins
the
sporting
blood
which
had
come
to
him
from
generations
of
hunting
squires
found
all
its
craving
satisfied
in
this
coursing
across

breakfast
in
the
galley
but
the
sound
expired
at
the
sight
of
the
distant
flutter
of
a
womans
scarf
in
the
stern
of
the
ship
he
halted
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
crisp
hair
with
an
expressive
gesture
of
almost
comical
perplexity
all
would
be
plain
sailing
enough
with
hope
at
the
prow
again
but
for
thishe
stamped
his
foot
to
choke
down
the
oath
of
qualificationthis
encumbrance
adrians
wife
and
madeleines
sister
as
such
entitled
to
all
honour
all
care
and
devotion
and
yet
as
such
again
hideously
doubly
unwelcome
to
him
as
he
stood
biting
his
lips
while
the
gorgeous
sunshine
of
the
young
spring
morning
beat
down
upon
his
bare
head
the
brawny
figure
of
the
mate
his
mahoganytinted
face
wrinkled
into
as
stiff
a
grin
as
if
it
had
been
indeed
carved
out
of
the
wood
in
question
intervened
between
his
abstracted
gaze
and
the
restless
amber
beyond
its
a
fine
day
sir
by
way
of
opening
conversation
the
irrepressible
satisfaction
conveyed
by
the
wide
display
of
tobaccostained
teeth
by
the
twinkle
in
the
hard
honest
eyes
called
up
a
queer
rueful
grimace
to
the
other
mans
face
do
you
know
curwen
he
said
that
you
brought
me
the
wrong
young
lady
last
night
the
sailor
jumped
back
in
amazement
the
wrong
young
lady
sir
staring
with
starting
incredulous
eyeballs
the
wrong
young
lady
here
he
clapped
his
thigh
well
of
allthe
wrong
young
lady
are
you
quite
sure
sir
captain
jack
laughed
aloud
but
it
was
with
a
bitter
twist
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
well
im
said
poor
curwen
all
his
importance
and
selfsatisfaction
had
left
him
as
suddenly
as
the
starch
a
soused
collar
he
scanned
his
masters
face
with
almost
pathetic
anxiety
oh
i
dont
blame
youyou
did
your
part
all
right
why
i
myself
fell
into
the
same
mistake
and
we
had
not
much
time
for
finding
it
out
had
we
the
lady
you
seethe
ladyshe
is
the
other
ladys
sister
and
she
came
with
a
message
and
so
we
carried
her
off
before
we
knew
where
we
wereor
she
either
added
captain
jack
as
a
mendacious
after
thought
well
im
reiterated
curwen
who
then
rubbed
his
scrubby
bristling
chin
scratched
his
poll
and
finally
broke
into
another
grinthis
time
of
the
kind
classified
as
sheepish
and
whatll
be
to
do
now
by
the
god
that
made
me
i
havent
a
notion
we
must
take
all
the
care
of
her
we
can
of
course
serve
her
her
meals
in
her
cabin
as
was
arranged
and
see
that
she
is
attended
to
just
as
the
other
young
lady
would
have
been
you
know
only
that
i
think
she
had
better
be
served
alone
and
i
shall
mess
downstairs
as
usual
and
then
if
we
can
leave
her
at
st
malo
we
shall
but
it
must
be
in
all
safety
curwen
for
its
a
terrible
responsibility
happily
we
have
now
the
time
to
think
meanwhile
i
have
slept
like
a
log
and
shei
see
is
astir
before
me
lord
bless
you
sir
she
has
been
up
these
two
hours
walking
the
deck
like
a
sailor
and
asking
about
things
and
enjoying
them
like
ah
she
is
a
rare
lady
that
she
is
and
it
is
the
wrong
onewell
this
is
a
go
and
i
was
remarking
to
bill
baxter
just
now
that
it
was
just
our
captains
luck
to
have
found
such
a
regular
sailors
young
woman
so
i
saidbegging
pardon
for
the
word
and
not
more
than
he
is
worth
says
he
and
so
said
i
also
and
she
the
wrong
lady
after
all
well
its
a
curious
thing
sir
nobody
could
be
like
to
guess
it
from
her
shes
a
wellplucked
one
with
her
wound
and
all
she
made
me
look
at
it
this
morning
when
i
brought
her
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
bite
youre
old
enough
to
be
my
father
says
she
as
pretty
as
can
be
so
you
shall
be
doctor
as
well
as
ladys
maid
and
if
youve
got
a
girl
of
your
own
itll
be
a
story
to
tell
her
by
the
fire
at
night
when
youre
home
again
so
she
said
and
never
winced
when
i
put
my
great
fingers
on
her
arm
i
was
all
of
a
tremble
i
declare
with
her
a
smiling
up
at
me
but
the
woundits
doing
finely
healing
as
nice
as
ever
i
see
and
not
a
sign
of
sickness
on
her
the
very
lady
as
i
was
saying
for
our
captainbut
here
she
comes
this
was
an
unwontedly
long
speech
for
curwen
and
silent
again
he
effaced
himself
discreetly
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
angry
ejaculation
that
had
sprung
to
his
captains
lips
but
not
without
a
backward
glance
of
admiration
at
the
tall
alert
figure
now
bearing
down
in
their
direction
with
steps
already
firmly
balanced
to
the
movement
of
the
ship
at
a
little
distance
from
captain
jack
molly
paused
as
if
to
scrutinise
the
horizon
and
enjoy
the
invigorating
atmosphere
in
reality
her
heart
was
beating
fast
her
breath
came
short
and
the
gaze
she
flung
from
the
faint
outline
of
coast
upon
one
side
to
the
vast
monotony
of
sparkling
sea
upon
the
other
conveyed
no
impression
to
her
troubled
mind
the
next
instant
he
was
by
her
side
as
she
smiled
at
him
he
noticed
that
her
face
was
pale
and
her
eyes
darkly
encircled
ah
madam
said
he
as
he
drew
close
and
lifted
his
hand
to
his
head
with
a
gesture
of
formal
courtesy
that
no
doubt
somewhat
astonished
a
couple
of
his
men
who
were
watching
the
group
with
covert
smiles
and
nudges
being
as
yet
unaware
of
the
misadventure
you
relieve
my
mind
of
anxiety
how
is
the
arm
does
it
make
you
suffer
much
no
you
must
be
strong
indeed
yes
i
am
strong
answered
she
and
flushed
and
looked
out
across
the
sea
inhaling
the
air
with
dilated
nostrils
within
her
her
soul
was
crying
out
to
him
it
was
as
if
there
was
a
tide
there
as
fierce
and
passionate
as
the
waves
around
her
all
bearing
straining
to
him
and
this
with
a
struggle
and
flow
so
resistless
that
she
could
neither
remember
the
past
nor
measure
the
future
but
only
feel
herself
carried
on
beaten
and
tossed
upon
these
great
waters
like
a
helpless
wreck
i
trust
you
are
well
attended
to
began
the
man
constrainedly
again
i
fear
you
will
have
to
endure
much
discomfort
i
had
reckoned
here
he
halted
galled
by
the
thought
of
what
it
was
he
had
reckoned
upon
the
thought
of
the
watchful
love
that
was
to
have
made
of
the
little
ship
a
very
nest
for
his
bride
of
the
exquisite
joy
it
was
to
have
harboured
and
he
set
his
teeth
at
fate
she
played
for
a
while
with
her
little
finger
tips
upon
the
rail
then
turned
her
gaze
full
and
bold
upon
him
i
do
not
complain
she
said
he
bowed
gravely
we
will
do
our
best
for
you
and
if
you
will
take
patience
the
time
will
pass
at
last
as
all
time
passes
i
have
a
few
books
they
shall
be
brought
into
your
cabin
in
three
days
we
shall
be
in
st
malothere
if
you
like
he
hesitated
embarrassed
there
echoed
lady
landale
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
upon
his
downcast
faceif
i
likewhat
we
could
leave
you
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
quickly
with
stormy
breaths
alone
moneyless
in
a
strange
townthat
is
well
and
kindly
thought
she
said
whence
had
come
to
her
this
strange
power
of
feeling
pain
she
had
not
known
that
one
could
suffer
in
ones
heart
like
this
she
whose
quarrel
with
life
hitherto
had
been
for
its
too
great
comfort
security
and
peace
she
felt
a
lump
rise
to
her
throat
and
tears
well
into
her
eyes
blurring
all
the
sunlit
vision
and
she
turned
her
head
away
and
beat
her
sound
left
hand
clenched
upon
the
ledge
before
heaven
cried
jack
distressed
out
of
his
unnatural
stiffness
you
mistake
me
lady
landale
i
am
only
anxious
to
do
what
is
best
for
you
what
adrian
would
wish
to
leave
you
alone
deserted
helpless
at
st
malo
you
could
not
have
thought
i
should
mean
that
no
indeed
i
would
have
seen
you
into
safe
hands
in
some
comfortable
hotel
with
a
maid
to
wait
upon
youi
know
of
such
a
placeadrian
could
not
have
been
long
in
coming
to
fetch
you
i
should
have
had
a
letter
ready
to
post
to
him
the
instant
we
landed
as
to
money
flushing
boyishly
that
is
the
least
considerationthere
is
no
dearth
of
that
to
fear
if
you
prefer
it
i
can
however
convey
you
somewhere
upon
the
english
coast
after
we
quit
st
malo
but
that
will
entail
a
longer
residence
for
you
here
on
board
ship
and
it
is
no
fit
place
for
you
still
looking
out
across
the
sea
molly
replied
in
a
deep
shaken
voice
unlike
her
own
you
did
not
think
it
unfit
for
my
sister
your
sister
but
your
sister
was
to
have
been
my
wife
burning
through
the
mists
of
her
unshed
tears
once
more
her
glance
returned
to
his
and
i
she
cried
and
here
was
suddenly
silent
again
gazing
at
the
thin
circlet
of
gold
upon
her
left
hand
beneath
the
flashing
diamonds
after
a
moment
then
she
broke
out
fiercelyoh
do
with
me
what
you
will
but
for
gods
sake
leave
me
in
peace
and
stamping
turned
her
shoulder
on
him
to
stare
straight
outwards
as
before
captain
jack
drew
back
paused
an
instant
clutched
his
hair
with
a
desperate
gesture
and
slowly
walked
away





the
voyage
of
the
peregrine
was
as
rapid
as
her
captain
had
hoped
and
the
dawn
of
the
fourth
day
broke
upon
them
from
behind
the
french
coast
where
normandy
joins
old
armorica
for
a
little
while
lady
landale
awakened
from
her
uneasy
sleep
by
the
unusual
stir
on
deck
lay
languidly
watching
the
light
as
it
filtered
through
the
porthole
of
her
little
cabin
the
colours
growing
out
of
greyness
on
the
walls
listening
to
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
mates
husky
voice
without
then
her
heart
tightened
with
a
premonition
of
the
coming
separation
she
sat
up
and
looked
out
of
her
window
as
the
horizon
rose
and
fell
giddily
to
her
eye
there
lay
the
fatal
line
of
land
the
land
of
her
blood
but
to
her
now
the
land
of
exile
she
had
seen
but
little
of
captain
jack
these
last
two
days
interchanged
but
few
and
formal
words
with
him
now
and
then
as
they
met
morning
and
evening
or
came
across
each
other
during
the
day
she
felt
that
he
avoided
her
but
she
had
seen
him
she
had
heard
his
voice
they
had
been
close
to
each
other
upon
the
great
seas
however
divided
and
this
had
been
something
to
feed
upon
now
what
prospect
before
her
hungry
heart
butstarvation
at
least
the
last
precious
moments
should
not
be
lost
to
her
she
rose
and
dressed
in
haste
a
difficult
operation
in
her
maimed
state
before
leaving
her
narrow
quarters
she
peered
into
the
lookingglass
with
an
eagerness
she
had
never
displayed
in
the
days
of
her
vain
girlhood
what
a
fright
she
said
to
the
anxious
face
that
looked
back
at
her
with
yearning
eyes
and
dark
burning
lips
and
she
thought
of
madeleines
placid
fairness
as
cain
might
of
abels
modest
altar
when
she
emerged
upon
deck
a
strange
and
beautiful
scene
was
spread
to
her
gaze
a
golden
haze
enveloped
the
water
and
the
coast
but
out
of
it
in
brown
jagged
outline
against
the
blazing
background
of
glowing
sunlight
rose
the
towers
the
pointed
roofs
and
spires
of
that
old
corsairs
hive
st
malo
the
waters
were
bright
green
frothed
with
oily
foam
around
the
ship
the
masts
cast
strange
long
black
shadows
and
molly
saw
one
spring
from
her
own
feet
as
she
moved
into
the
morning
glow
the
peregrine
she
noticed
was
cruising
parallel
with
the
coast
instead
of
making
for
the
harbour
and
just
now
all
was
very
still
on
board
two
men
conspicuous
against
the
yellow
sky
stood
apart
a
little
forward
with
their
backs
turned
to
her
one
of
these
was
captain
jack
gazing
steadily
at
the
town
through
a
telescope
the
other
the
mate
both
were
silent
silently
herself
and
unnoticed
molly
went
up
and
stood
beside
them
observing
her
sisters
lover
as
intently
as
he
that
unknown
distant
point
she
presently
saw
the
lean
hand
nearest
her
tremble
ever
so
slightly
as
it
held
the
glass
then
he
turned
and
handed
it
to
his
companion
saying
briefly
see
what
you
make
of
it
the
man
lifted
the
glass
set
it
looked
dropped
his
hand
and
faced
his
captain
their
eyes
met
but
neither
spoke
for
a
second
or
two
it
is
so
then
said
the
captain
at
last
aye
sir
no
mistake
about
that
theres
the
tricolour
up
againand
be
damned
to
itas
large
as
life
to
be
sure
the
healthy
tan
of
the
captains
face
had
not
altered
by
one
shade
his
mouth
was
set
in
its
usual
firm
line
but
by
the
intuition
of
her
fiery
soul
the
woman
beside
him
knew
that
he
had
received
a
blow
a
strange
thing
went
on
curwen
in
a
grumbling
guttural
bass
and
its
only
a
year
ago
since
they
set
up
the
old
white
napkin
again
you
did
not
look
for
this
sir
he
too
had
his
intuitions
no
curwen
it
is
the
last
thing
i
looked
for
and
it
spells
failure
to
mefailure
once
more
as
he
spoke
he
turned
his
head
slightly
and
perceiving
molly
standing
close
behind
him
glanced
up
sharply
and
frowned
then
strove
to
smooth
his
brow
into
conventional
serenity
and
greeted
her
civilly
curwen
clenching
his
hard
hands
together
round
the
telescope
retired
a
step
and
stood
apart
still
hanging
on
his
captains
every
gesture
like
a
faithful
dog
what
does
it
mean
asked
molly
disregarding
the
morning
salutation
it
means
strange
things
to
france
responded
captain
jack
slowly
with
a
bitter
smile
and
to
me
madam
it
means
that
i
have
come
on
a
wild
goose
chase
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
glass
once
more
as
he
spokealthough
even
by
the
naked
eye
the
flag
minute
as
it
was
could
be
seen
to
flash
red
in
the
breezeand
sought
the
faroff
flutter
again
and
then
closing
the
instrument
with
an
angry
snap
tossed
it
back
but
what
does
it
mean
reiterated
molly
a
wild
impatience
a
wild
hope
trembling
in
her
breast
it
means
madam
that
i
have
brought
my
pigs
to
the
wrong
market
cried
captain
jack
still
with
the
smile
that
sat
so
strangely
upon
his
frank
lips
that
the
goods
i
have
to
deliver
i
cannot
deliver
for
if
there
is
any
meaning
in
symbols
by
the
wave
of
that
tricolour
yonder
the
country
has
changed
rulers
again
my
dealings
were
to
be
with
the
kings
men
and
as
they
are
not
here
at
least
no
longer
in
powerhow
could
they
be
under
that
ragi
must
even
trot
the
cargo
home
again
not
a
word
to
the
men
curwen
but
give
the
order
to
sheer
off
we
have
lowered
the
blue
white
and
red
too
often
have
not
we
to
risk
a
good
english
ship
unarmed
under
the
nozzles
of
those
republican
or
imperial
guns
the
man
grinned
the
two
could
trust
each
other
molly
turned
away
and
moved
seawards
for
she
knew
that
the
joy
upon
her
face
was
not
to
be
hidden
captain
jack
fell
to
pacing
the
deck
with
bent
head
and
long
slow
steps
absorbed
in
dovetailing
the
last
secret
arrangements
of
his
venture
and
more
intent
still
during
his
very
few
hours
of
idleness
on
the
engrossing
thought
of
love
he
had
had
no
knowledge
of
the
extraordinary
challenge
to
fate
cast
by
bonaparte
of
that
challenge
which
was
to
end
in
the
last
and
decisive
clash
of
french
and
english
hosts
he
had
not
even
heard
of
the
corsicans
return
to
france
with
his
handful
of
grenadiers
for
newspapers
were
scarce
at
scarthey
but
even
had
he
heard
like
the
rest
of
the
world
he
would
no
doubt
have
thought
no
more
of
it
than
as
a
mad
freak
born
of
the
vanquished
usurpers
foolhardy
restlessness
but
the
conclave
of
plenipotentiaries
assembled
at
vienna
were
not
more
thunderstruck
when
on
that
very
19th
of
march
the
semaphore
brought
them
news
of
the
legitimate
king
of
france
once
more
fled
and
of
his
country
once
more
abandoned
to
the
hated
usurper
than
was
captain
jack
as
he
watched
the
distant
flagstaff
in
the
sunrise
and
saw
when
the
morning
port
gun
had
vomited
forth
its
white
cloud
on
the
ramparts
of
st
malo
the
fatal
stripes
run
up
the
slender
line
in
lieu
of
the
white
standard
but
jack
smiths
mind
like
his
body
was
quick
in
action
the
sun
had
travelled
but
a
degree
or
two
over
the
wide
undulating
land
the
mists
were
yet
rising
when
suddenly
he
halted
and
called
the
mate
in
those
commanding
tones
that
had
from
the
first
time
she
had
heard
them
echoed
in
mollys
heart
bring
her
alongside
one
of
those
smacks
yonder
the
furthest
out
to
sea
thereupon
followed
curwens
hoarse
bellow
an
ordered
stampede
upon
the
deck
and
gracefully
with
no
more
seeming
effort
than
a
swan
upon
a
garden
pond
the
peregrine
veered
and
glided
towards
the
rough
skiff
with
its
single
ochre
sail
and
its
couple
of
brownfaced
fishermen
who
had
left
their
nets
to
watch
her
advance
captain
jack
leant
over
the
side
his
hands
over
his
mouth
and
hailed
them
in
his
britishfrenchcorrect
enough
but
stiff
to
his
tongue
as
molly
heard
and
smiled
at
and
loved
him
for
in
womans
way
when
she
loves
at
all
ahoy
the
friend
a
golden
piece
for
him
who
will
come
on
board
and
tell
the
news
of
the
town
a
brief
consultation
between
the
fisher
pair
un
cu
dor
repeated
captain
jack
then
there
was
a
flash
of
white
teeth
on
the
two
weatherbeaten
faces
on
y
va
patron
cried
one
of
the
fellows
cheerfully
and
jumped
into
his
dinghey
while
his
comrade
still
stared
and
grinned
and
the
stalwart
lads
of
the
peregrine
grinned
back
at
the
queer
foreign
figure
with
the
brown
cap
and
the
big
gold
earrings
soon
the
fishermans
bare
feet
were
thudding
on
the
deck
and
he
stood
before
the
english
captain
cap
in
hand
his
little
quick
black
eyes
roaming
in
all
directions
over
the
wonders
of
the
beautiful
white
ship
with
innocent
curiosity
but
before
captain
jack
could
get
his
tongue
round
another
french
phrase
molly
detaching
herself
from
her
post
of
observation
came
forward
smiling
let
me
speak
to
him
she
said
he
will
understand
me
better
and
it
will
go
quicker
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
captain
jack
hesitated
a
moment
saw
the
advantage
of
the
suggestion
and
then
accepted
the
offer
with
the
queer
embarrassment
that
always
came
over
him
in
his
relations
with
her
you
are
very
good
he
said
oh
i
like
to
talk
the
father
and
mother
tongue
she
said
gaily
and
sweetly
her
eyes
danced
he
had
never
seen
her
in
this
mood
and
as
before
grudgingly
had
to
admit
her
beauty
and
if
you
will
allow
it
she
went
on
i
am
glad
to
be
of
use
too
the
fisherman
twirling
his
cap
in
his
knotted
fingers
stared
at
her
open
mouthed
une
si
belle
dame
like
a
queen
and
speaking
his
tongue
that
it
was
a
music
to
listen
to
this
was
in
truth
a
ship
of
marvels
ah

then
they
had

enough
the
fisherman
paddled
back
to
his
skiff
and
molly
stood
watching
from
a
little
distance
the
motionless
figure
of
the
captain
of
the
peregrine
as
with
one
hand
clenching

handrail
he
gazed

after
a

minutes

touched
him
lightly

captain
jack
turned
slowly
to
look
at
him
his
face
was
a
little
pale
and
his
jaw
set
but
the
mate
who
had
served
under
him
since
the
day
he
first
stepped
upon

he
would
have
expressed
it
himself
saw
that
he
had
taken
his
decision
and
he
stepped
back
satisfied
ready
to
shape
his
course
for
the
near
harbour

for
the

wagged
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
shifted
his
hand
on
the
helm
ay
ay
sir
he
said
after
just
an
instants
pause
i
would
not
run
you
and
the
men
into
unnecessary
danger
that
you
may
be
sure
of
but
the
fact
is
curwen
im
in
a
devil
of
a
fix
all
round
theres
no
use
hiding
it
from
you
and
all
things
considered
to
land
the
lady
and
the
cargo
at
the
lighthouse
itself
gives
me
as
fair
a
chance
of
getting
out
of
it
as
any
plan
i
can
think
of
the
cargos
not
all
my
own
and
its
a
valuable
one
i
daresay
you
have
guessed
as
much
and
its
not
the
kind
we
want
revenue
men
to
pry
into
i
could
not
unload
elsewhere
that
i
know
of
without
creating
suspicion
as
to
storing
it
elsewhere
its
out
of
the
question
scartheys
the
place
though
its
a
damned
risky
one
just
now
but
weve
run
many
a
risk
together
in
our
day
have
we
not
ay
sir
whos
afraid
then
theres
the
lady
lowering
his
voice
shes
lady
landale
my
friends
wife
the
wife
of
the
best
friend
ever
man
had
ay
you
remember
him
i
doubt
notthe
gentleman
seaman
of
the
porcupinei
owe
him
more
than
i
can
ever
repay
and
he
owes
me
something
too
that
sort
of
thing
binds
men
together
and
see
what
i
have
done
to
himcarried
off
his
wife
curwen
grunted
enigmatically
and
disengaged
a
hand
to
scratch
his
chin
i
must
have
speech
with
him
i
must
it
is
enough
to
drive
me
mad
to
think
what
he
may
be
thinking
of
me
what
i
purpose
is
this
well
disguise
the
ship
as
far
as
we
can
we
have
the
time
paint
her
a
new
streak
and
alter
those
topsails
change
the
set
of
the
bowsprit
and
strike
out
her
name
thats
unlucky
said
the
mate
unlucky
is
it
well
shes
not
been
so
lucky
this
run
that
we
need
fear
to
change
the
luck
then
curwen
well
slip
in
at
night
at
a
high
tide
watching
for
our
opportunity
and
a
dark
sky
well
unship
the
cargo
and
then
you
shall
take
command
of
her
and
carry
her
off
to
the
east
coast
and
wait
there
till
i
am
able
to
send
you
word
or
join
you
it
will
only
be
a
few
hours
danger
for
the
men
after
all
still
keeping
his
seaman
eye
upon
the
compass
curwen
cleared
his
throat
with
a
gruesome
noise
then
in
tones
which
seemed
to
issue
with
difficulty
from
some
immense
depth
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
that
aint
a
bargain
how
now
cried
his
captain
sharply
no
sir
rolling
his
head
portentously
that
dont
run
to
a
bargain
that
dont
the
lads
of
the
peregrine
ll
stick
to
their
skipper
through
thick
and
thin
ill
warrant
them
every
man
jack
of
them
and
if
there
was
one
who
grumbled
id
have
my
knife
in
him
before
another
caught
the
temper
from
himi
would
or
my
names
not
curwen
if
ye
bid
us
steer
to
hell
well
do
it
for
you
sir
and
welcome
but
for
to
go
and
leave
you
thereno
sir
it
cant
be
done
captain
jack
gave
a
little
laugh
that
was
as
tender
as
a
womans
tear
curwen
rolled
his
head
again
and
mumbled
to
himself
it
cant
be
done
then
jack
smith
clapped
his
hand
on
the
sailors
shoulder
but
its
got
to
be
done
he
cried
it
is
the
only
thing
you
can
do
to
help
me
curwen
to
have
our
peregrine
out
in
the
daylight
on
that
coast
would
be
stark
madnessno
disguise
could
avail
her
and
you
cant
change
your
ugly
old
phiz
can
you
as
for
me
i
must
have
a
few
days
on
shore
danger
or
no
danger
ah
curwen
with
a
sudden
passionate
outbreak
there
are
times
when
a
mans
life
is
the
least
of
his
thoughts
couldnt
i
stop
with
you
sir
i
would
not
trust
the
ship
to
another
and
you
would
double
the
risk
for
me
i
could
double
a
blow
for
you
too
cried
the
fellow
hoarsely
but
if
its
got
to
beit
must
be
ill
do
it
sir
i
count
on
it
said
the
captain
briefly
as
the
ring
of
his
retreating
steps
died
away
upon
his
ear
the
mate
shook
his
head
in
melancholy
fashion
women
he
said
is
very
well
ive
nought
to
say
against
them
in
their
way
and
the
seas
very
wellas
i
ought
to
know
but
women
and
the
sea
it
dont
agree
theys
jealous
one
of
the
other
and
a
man
gets
torn
between
as
molly
sat
in
her
cabin
watching
the
darkening
sky
outside
with
dreaming
eyes
she
started
on
seeing
captain
jack
approach
and
instead
of
passing
her
with
cold
salute
halt
and
look
in
i
would
speak
a
word
with
you
he
said
on
deck
then
said
molly
she
felt
somehow
as
if
under
the
broad
heaven
they
were
nearer
each
other
than
in
that
narrow
room
the
sea
was
rough
the
wind
had
risen
and
still
blew
from
the
north
it
was
cold
but
her
blood
ran
too
fast
these
days
to
heed
it
she
drew
one
of
the
capes
of
her
cloak
over
her
head
and
staggering
a
little
for
the
schooner
sailing
close
to
the
wind
pitched
and
rolled
to
some
purpose
she
made
for
her
usual
station
at
the
bulwarks
well
she
asked
he
briefly
told
her
his
purpose
of
returning
to
scarthey
direct
her
eye
dilated
she
grew
pale
is
that
not
dangerous
he
made
a
contemptuous
gesture
but
they
must
be
watching
for
you
on
that
coast
you
have
sunk
the
boatkilled
those
men
to
return
theremy
god
what
folly
i
must
land
my
goods
madam
you
forget
that
i
have
more
contraband
on
board
than
smuggler
as
i
am
even
i
bargained
for
if
it
is
for
mei
would
rather
fling
myself
into
the
waves
this
instant
than
that
you
should
expose
yourself
to
danger
then
i
should
fling
myself
after
you
and
that
would
be
more
dangerous
still
he
smiled
a
little
mockingly
upon
her
as
he
spoke
but
the
words
called
a
transient
fire
into
her
face
you
would
risk
your
life
to
save
me
she
cried
to
save
adrians
wife
madam
bah
he
would
have
gone
then
but
she
held
him
with
her
free
hand
she
was
again
white
to
the
lips
but
her
eyeshow
they
burned
he
would
have
given
all
his
worth
to
avoid
what
he
felt
was
coming
a
woman
at
such
a
juncture
may
forbid
speech
or
deny
her
ear
a
man
unless
he
would
seem
the
first
of
josephs
or
the
last
of
coxcombs
dare
not
even
hint
at
his
unwelcome
suspicions
i
will
not
have
you
go
into
this
danger
i
will
not
stammered
molly
incoherently
the
dusk
was
spreading
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
larger
in
the
uncertain
light
lady
landale
you
misunderstand
it
is
true
that
to
see
you
safely
restored
to
your
husbands
roof
is
an
added
reason
for
my
return
to
scartheybut
were
you
not
on
board
i
should
go
all
the
same
i
will
tell
you
why
it
is
a
secret
but
you
shall
know
it
i
have
treasures
on
board
vast
treasures
confided
to
me
and
i
must
store
them
in
safety
till
i
can
give
them
back
to
their
rightful
owners
this
i
can
only
do
at
scartheyfor
to
cruise
about
with
such
a
cargo
indefinitely
is
as
impossible
as
to
land
it
elsewhere
and
more
than
this
had
i
not
that
second
reason
i
have
yet
a
third
that
urges
me
to
scarthey
still
for
madeleine
she
whispered
and
her
teeth
gleamed
between
her
lips
he
remained
silent
and
tried
gently
to
disengage
himself
from
her
slender
fingers
but
the
feeling
of
their
frailness
the
knowledge
of
her
wound
made
her
feeble
grasp
as
an
iron
vice
to
his
manliness
she
came
closer
to
him
do
you
not
remember
thenwhat
she
has
said
to
you
what
she
wrote
to
you
in
cold
bloodthe
cowardin
the
very
moment
when
you
were
staking
your
life
for
love
of
her
i
remember
if
you
do
notyou
have
deceived
me
she
wrote
and
her
hand
never
trembled
for
the
words
ran
as
neatly
and
primly
as
ever
they
did
in
her
convent
copy
books
you
are
not
what
you
represented
yourself
to
beyou
have
taken
advantage
of
the
inexperience
of
an
ignorant
girl
i
have
been
deluded
and
deceived
i
never
wish
to
see
you
to
hear
of
you
again
for
heavens
sake

he
commanded
fiercely
and
wrenched
his
arm
away
to
face
her
with
menacing
eyes
ah
does
it
rouse
so
much
anger
in
you
even
to

repeated
what
she
did
not

to
write
did
not

to
allow

her
if
you

as
i

you
she

when
she

that
she

it
was
the
truthshe
did
it
in
cold
blood
she
loved

and
yet
she
believed
you
a
liar
she
loved
you
and
she
thinks
you
a
traitor

your

for

life
she
stopped
drew
her
breath
with
a
long
gasp
the
spray
from
a
turbulent
wave
came
dashing
across
the
bows
into
her
face
and
as
once
the
blood
of
ccile
de
savenaye
had
been
roused
by
the
call
of
the
wild
waters
to
leave
safety
and
children
and
seek
her
doom
so
now
the
blood
she
had
transmitted
to
her
child
leaped
to
the
same
impulse
and
bore
her
onwards
with
irresistible
force
when
she
pursued
in
the
darkness
you
took
me
in
your
arms
and
kissed
me
what
did
the
touch
of
my
lips
bring
to
you
my
lips
not
madeleines
were
you
not

my
soul

yours

i

that
we
were
made
for

other

sea
and
the
wide
free
life
upon

he
stood
before
her
and
the
sweat
that
had
gathered
upon
his
brow
ran
down
his
face
but
as
the
meaning
of
her
proposition
was
borne
in
upon
him
a
shudder
of
fury
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
no

after

silence

the
beating
of
her
heart
turned
her
sick
and
cold
and
all
her
fever
heat
fell
from
her
leaving
nothing

the
knowledge
of
her
shame
her
misery
her
hopeless
love

you
back
to
your
cabinit
is
late
she
went
with
him
as
one
halfconscious
at
the
door
she
paused
the
light
from
within
fell
upon
his
face
deeply
troubled
and
white
but
upon
the
lips
and
brows
what
scorn
he
was
a
god
among
men
how
she
loved
him
and
he
scorned
her
poor
murthering
moll
she
looked
up
have
you
no
word
for
me
she
cried
passionately
only
this
lady
landale
i
will
forget





back
towards
the
distant
northern
light
the
schooner
clove
her
valiant
way
in
spite
of
adverse
winds
and
high
seas
the
return
journey
was
slower
than
the
outward
and
since
the
second
day
of
it
the
lady
kept
much
to
her
cabin
while
the
captain
would
pace
the
deck
till
far
into
the
night
with
unwonted
uneasiness
to
him
the
white
wings
of
his
peregrine
were
bearing
him
all
too
slowly
for
endurance
while
to
the
stormy
womans
heart
that
beat
through
the
night
watches
in
passionate
echo
to
his
restless
tread
every
instant
that
passed
but
brought
nearer
the
prospect
of
a
future
so
intolerable
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
face
it
a
gloom
seemed
to
have
come
over
the
tight
little
craft
and
to
have
spread
even
to
the
crew
who
missed
the
ring
of
their
captains
jolly
laugh
and
the
sound
of
his
song
when
within
a
days
sail
of
the
goal
the
planned
disguise
was
finally
carried
out
upon
the
schooners
fair
sides
and
rigging
her
beautiful
stretch
of
sail
curtailed
and
her
name
final
disgrace
superseded
by
the
unmeaning
title
of
the
pretty
jane
open
murmurs
broke
out
which
it
required
all
curwens
severityand
if
the
old
martinet
did
not
execute
the
summary
justice
he
had
threatened
he
was
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
neverthelessand
all
jacks
personal
influence
to
quell
the
dawn
of
the
next
day
crept
gloomily
upon
a
world
of
rain
with
long
faces
the
men
paddled
about
the
deck
doing
their
duty
in
silence
curwens
old
countenance
set
into
grimmer
lines
than
ever
looked
as
if
it
had
just
been
detached
from
the
prow
of
some
vessel
after
hard
experience
of
stress
and
storm
the
spirits
of
the
captain
alone
seemed
to
rise
in
proportion
as
they
drew
nearer
land
the
moon
sets
at
halfpast
eleven
he
said
to
curwen
but
we
need
not
fear
her
tonight
by
halfpast
twelve
i
reckon
on
your
having
those
twentyfive
damned
casks
safe
in
the
cave
you
took
them
from
it
is
a
matter
of
three
journeys
and
then
the
nose
of
the
pretty
jane
must
be
pointed
for
the
orkneys
alls
going
well





night
had
fallen
the
gaudy
bubbling
and
remorseful
day
had
crept
into
the
bosom
of
the
sea
from
the
crosstrees
the
lookout
man
had
already
been
able
to
distinguish
through
the
glass
the
faint
distant
glimmer
of
scarthey
beacon
when
captain
jack
knocked
for
admittance
at
lady
landales
cabin
for
the
last
time
as
he
thought
with
a
sigh
of
relief
in
the
course
of
an
hour
madam
he
said
in
a
grave
tone
i
hope
to
restore
you
to
land
as
for
me
i
shall
have
again
to
hide
in
the
peel
though
i
hope
it
will
not
be
for
long
my
fateand
by
my
fate
i
mean
not
only
my
safety
but
my
honour
which
as
you
know
is
now
bound
up
in
the
safety
of
the
treasureswill
be
in
your
hands
for
i
must
wait
at
scarthey
till
i
can
see
adrian
again
and
upon
your
return
to
pulwick
i
must
beg
you
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
ask
him
to
come
and
see
me
she
replied
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
i
will
not
fail
you
but
her
great
eyes
dark
circled
fixed
upon
him
with
a
meek
sorrowful
look
spoke
dumbly
the
troublous
tale
of
her
mind
in
her
subdued
mood
the
likeness
to
madeleine
was
more
obtrusive
than
it
had
ever
yet
been
he
contemplated
her
with
melancholy
and
drew
a
heavy
sigh
molly
groaned
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
though
her
lips
tight
set
betrayed
no
sound
oh
miserable
chaos
of
the
human
world
that
such
pent
up
love
should
be
wastedwasted
that
they
too
young
and
strong
and
beautiful
alone
together
so
near
with
such
glorious
happiness
within
their
reach
should
yet
be
so
perversely
far
asunder
there
was
a
long
silence
they
looked
into
each
others
eyes
but
he
was
unseeing
his
mind
was
far
away
dwelling
upon
the
memory
of
that
last
meeting
with
his
love
under
the
fir
trees
of
pulwick
only
ten
days
ago
but
now
as
irrevocably
far
as
things
seem
that
may
never
again
be
at
length
she
made
a
movement
which
brought
him
back
to
present
realitya
movement
of
her
wounded
arm
as
if
of
pain
and
he
came
back
to
lady
landale
worn
with
the
fatigue
of
these
long
days
in
the
cramped
discomfort
of
a
schooner
cabin
thinned
by
pain
and
fevered
thinkings
shorn
of
all
that
daintiness
of
appearance
which
can
only
be
maintained
in
the
midst
of
luxury
and
yet
by
the
light
of
the
flickering
lamp
more
triumphantly
beautiful
than
ever
his
thoughts
leaped
to
his
friend
with
a
pang
of
remorse
you
are
sufferingyou
are
ill
he
said
thus
do
i
bring
you
back
to
him
who
last
saw
you
so
full
of
strength
but
you
will
recover
at
pulwick
suffering
ill
ah
my
god
as
if
suffocating
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
bowed
her
head
till
it
rested
on
the
table
and
then
he
heard
her
murmur
in
a
weary
voice
recover
at
pulwick
my
god
my
god
the
air
at
pulwick
will
stifle
me
i
think
he
waited
a
moment
in
silence
and
saw
that
she
was
weeping
then
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
gentle
hand
nearly
all
the
lights
of
the
ship
were
now
extinguished
and
in
a
gloom
as
great
as
that
in
which
they
had
started
upon
their
unsuccessful
venture
the
peregrine
and
her
crew
returned
to
the
little
island
which
had
already
been
so
fateful
to
them
captain
jack
had
taken
the
helm
himself
and
curwen
stood
upon
his
right
hand
waiting
patiently
for
his
commands
for
an
hour
or
so
they
hung
off
the
shore
the
rain
fell
close
and
fine
around
them
it
was
as
if
sea
and
sky
were
merging
by
slow
imperceptible
degrees
into
one
the
beacon
light
looming
halo
encircled
through
the
mist
seemed
like
a
monster
eye
to
watch
with
unmoved
contempt
the
restlessness
of
these
pigmies
in
the
grand
solitude
of
the
night
who
shall
say
with
what
conflict
of
soul
molly
in
her
narrow
seclusion
saw
the
light
of
scarthey
grow
out
of
the
dimness
till
its
rays
fell
across
the
darkened
cabin
and
glimmered
on
her
wedding
ring
at
last
the
captain
drew
his
watch
and
by
the
faint
rays
upon
the
binnacle
saw
the
hour
had
come
boat
loaded
curwen
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
this
hour
sir
ready
to
cast
right
sir
now
curwen
low
from
man
to
man
the
order
ran
through
the
ship
and
the
anchor
was
dropped
almost
within
a
musket
shot
of
the
peel
it
was
high
tide
but
no
hand
but
captain
jacks
would
have
dared
risk
the
vessel
so
close
she
swung
round
ready
to
slip
at
a
moments
notice
he
left
the
helm
and
in
the
wet
darkness
cannoned
against
the
burly
figure
of
his
mate
you
curwen
remember
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
remain
hereas
soon
as
the
men
are
back
from
the
last
run
sheer
off
he
grasped
the
horny
hand
curwen
made
an
inarticulate
noise
in
his
big
throat
but
the
grip
of
his
fingers
upon
his
masters
was
of
eloquence
sufficient
let
some
one
call
the
lady
a
couple
of
men
ran
forward
with
dark
lanterns
the
rest
gathered
round
now
my
lads
brisk
and
silent
is
the
word
the
cabin
door
opened
and
molly
came
forth
the
darkness
hid
the
pallor
of
her
face
but
it
could
not
hide
the
faltering
of
her
steps
captain
jack
sprang
forward
and
gave
her
his
arm
and
she
leant
upon
it
without
speaking
heavily
for
one
moment
she
stopped
as
if
she
could
not
tear
her
feet
from
the
beloved
planks
but
curwen
caught
her
by
the
other
arm
and
then
she
was
on
the
swinging
ladder
and
so
she
left
the
peregrine





the
gig
was
almost
filled
with
barrels
there
was
only
room
for
the
four
oarsmen
selected
besides
the
captain
and
herself
the
boat
shoved
off
she
looked
back
and
saw
as
once
before
the
great
wall
of
the
ships
side
rise
sheer
above
the
sea
saw
the
triangle
of
light
again
slide
down
to
lie
a
span
above
the
waterline
with
what
a
leaping
heart
she
had
set
forth
that
black
night
away
from
the
hateful
lighthouse
beam
to
that
glimmer
of
promise
and
mystery
and
now
she
felt
herself
grow
sick
at
the
thought
of
that
homecoming
at
the
vision
of
the
close
warm
rooms
of
her
husbands
melancholy
eyes
yet
as
she
sat
the
sleeve
of
the
captains
rough
sailor
coat
touched
her
shoulder
and
she
remembered
she
was
still
with
him
it
was
not
all
death
yet
in
less
than
three
minutes
they
touched
ground
he
jumped
into
the
water
and
stretched
out
his
arms
for
molly
she
rose
giddily
and
his
embrace
folded
her
round
the
waves
rolled
in
with
surge
and
thud
and
dashed
their
spray
upon
them
and
still
the
rain
fell
and
beat
upon
her
head
from
which
she
had
impatiently
pushed
her
hood
but
her
spirit
had
no
heed
for
things
of
the
body
this
night
oh
if
the
sea
would
open
sudden
deeps
before
them
if
even
the
quicksand
would
seize
them
in
its
murderous
jaws
what
ecstasy
the
hideous
lingering
death
might
hold
for
her
so
that
only
she
lay
thus
in
his
arms
to
the
end
it
was
over
now
his
arms
had
clasped
her
for
the
last
time
she
stood
alone
upon
the
dry
sand
and
her
heart
was
in
hell
he
was
speaking
asking
her
pardon
for
not
going
at
once
with
her
to
see
her
into
the
keep
but
he
dared
not
leave
the
beach
till
his
cargo
was
landed
and
he
must
show
the
men
the
way
to
the
caves
would
she
forgive
him
would
she
go
with
him
forgive
him
go
with
him
she
almost
laughed
aloud
a
few
poor
moments
more
beside
him
they
would
be
as
the
drops
of
water
to
the
burning
tongue
of
dives
yes
she
would
go
with
him
one
by
one
the
precious
caskets
were
carried
between
a
couple
of
men
who
stumbled
in
the
darkness
close
on
their
captains
heels
and
the
lady
walked
beside
him
and
stood
beside
him
without
a
word
in
the
falling
rain
the
boat
went
backwards
and
forwards
twice
before
the
hour
had
run
out
the
luckless
cargo
was
all
once
more
landed
and
the
captain
heard
with
infinite
relief
the
last
oarstrokes
dwindling
away
in
the
distance
and
saw
the
lights
suddenly
disappear
you
have
been
very
patient
he
said
to
molly
then
with
a
gentle
note
in
his
voice
but
she
did
not
answer
are
the
souls
of
the
damned
patient

lady

her

and
she

first

here

man
cried
captain
jack
looking
with
concern
at
lady
landale
who
in
truth
seemed
scarcely
able
to
stand
and
whose
fluctuating

in

at

her
suddenly
illumined

and
turned
abruptly
on
his
heel
with
a
grinding
noise

your

said
harshly

captain

i
shall
see
you
tomorrow
there
was
a
wistful
query
in
her
voice
and
look
captain
smith
bowed
distantly
and
coldly
and
hastened
from
the
room
accompanied
by
ren
while
openmouthed
and
blinking
rosy
blowsy
and
amazed
mrs
potter
made
her
entry
on
the
scene
and
stared
at
her
mistress
with
the
roundest
of
blue
eyes





my
good
renny
said
the
captain
i
have
no
time
to
lose
i
have
a
hard
hours
work
to
do
before
i
can
even
think
of
talking
i
want
your
help
your
light
will
burn
all
safe
for
the
time
will
it
not
hark
ye
man
you
have
been
so
faithful
a
fellow
to
my
one
friend
that
i
am
going
to
trust
to
you
matters
which
concern
my
own
honour
and
my
own
life
ask
no
question
but
do
what
i
tell
you
if
you
would
help
one
who
has
helped
your
master
long
ago
one
whom
your
master
would
wish
you
to
help
thus
adjured
ren
repressed
his
growing
astonishment
at
the
incomprehensible
development
of
events
and
having
under
direction
provided
the
sailor
with
a
lantern
and
himself
with
a
wide
tarpaulin
and
sundry
carpenters
tools
he
followed
his
leader
readily
enough
through
the
ruinous
passages
half
choked
up
with
sand
which
led
from
the
interior
of
the
ruins
to
one
of
the
sea
caves
before
reaching
the
openmouthed
rocky
chamber
the
captain
obscured
the
light
and
ren
promptly
barked
his
shins
against
a
barrel
sacrebleu
he
cried
feeling
with
quick
hands
the
nature
of
the
obstruction
more
kegs
the
same
my
friend
now
hang
that
tarpaulin
against
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
be
sure
it
is
close
then
we
may
again
have
some
light
upon
the
matter
what
we
must
do
will
not
bear
interference
and
moving
glimmers
on
a
dark
night
have
told
tales
before
this
as
soon
as
the
beach
entrance
was
made
secure
the
captain
uncovered
his
lantern
and
as
the
double
row
of
kegs
stood
revealed
his
eyes
rapidly
scanned
their
number
yes
they
were
all
there
five
and
twenty
now
to
work
man
we
have
to
crack
every
one
of
these
nuts
and
take
the
kernels
out
even
as
he
spoke
he
turned
the
nearest
cask
on
end
with
a
blow
of
chisel
and
mallet
stove
in
the
head
and
began
dragging
out
quantities
of
loose
tow
in
the
centre
of
the
barrel
secured
in
position
on
to
a
stout
middle
batten
was
a
bag
of
sailcloth
closely
bound
with
cord
this
he
lifted
with
an
effort
for
it
was
over
a
hundredweight
and
flung
upon
the
sand
in
a
corner
thats
the
kernel
you
see
he
said
to
ren
who
had
watched
the
operation
with
keen
interest
and
when
we
have
shelled
them
all
i
will
show
you
where
to
put
them
in
safety
now
carry
onthe
quicker
the
better
the
sooner
we
have
it
all
upstairs
the
freer
i
shall
breathe
without
another
word
entering
into
the
spirit
of
haste
which
seemed
to
fill
his
companion
and
nobly
controlling
his
seething
curiosity
ren
set
to
work
on
his
side
with
his
usual
dexterousness
half
an
hour
of
speechless
destructive
labour
completed
the
first
part
of
the
task
then
the
two
men
carried
the
weighty
bags
into
the
room
which
had
been
captain
jacks
in
the
keep
and
when
they
had
travelled
to
and
fro
a
dozen
times
with
each
heavy
load
and
the
whole
treasure
was
at
length
accumulated
upstairs
ren
with
fresh
surprise
and
admiration
saw
the
captain
lift
the
hearthstone
and
disclose
a
recess
in
the
heavy
masonrypresumably
a
flue
in
the
living
days
of
scarthey
peelwhich
although
much
blocked
with
stony
rubbish
had
been
evidently
improved
by
the
last
lodger
during
his
period
of
solitary
residence
into
a
convenient
and
very
secure
hidingplace
here
was
the
precious
pyramid
now
heaped
up
the
stone
was
returned
to
its
place
and
the
two
stood
in
front
of
each
other
mopping
their
faces
thank
goodness
it
is
done
said
jack
smith
and
thank
you
too
renny
tomorrow
break
up
these
casks
and
add
the
staves
to
your
firewood
stack
then
nobody
but
you
in
this
part
of
the
world

nights

ehphew
i
am
tired
bring
me
some
food
and
some
brandy
like
a
good
fellow
then
you
can
back
to
your
pillow
and
flatter
yourself
that
you
have
helped
jack
smith
out
of
a
famous
quandary
ren
grinned
and
rushed
to
execute
the
order
he
had
less
desire
for
his
pillow
than
for
the
gratification
of
his
hyperexcited
curiosity
but
although
pressed
to
quaff
one
cup
of
good
fellowship
and
yet
another
he
was
not
destined
to
get
his
information
that
night
from
the
captain
who
had
much
ado
to
strangle
his
yawns
sufficiently
to
swallow
a
mouthful
or
two
of
food
no
one
must
know
renny
was
all
he
said
at
last
between
two
gapes
kicking
the
hearthstone
significantly
and
stretching
his
arms
not
even
the
wife
then
he
flung
himself
all
dressed
upon
his
bed
and
my
faith
said
ren
when
he
sought
his
wife
a
moment
later
he
was
fast
asleep
before
i
had
closed
the
door
chapter
xxviii
the
end
of
the
thread
madeleine
had
appeared
greatly
distressed
at
the
thought
that
through
her
her
sister
was
now
in
so
doubtful
and
precarious
a
situation
it
was
part
of
her
punishment
she
told
herself
for
her
sins
of
deceit
and
unmaidenliness
in
encouraging
and
meeting
a
clandestine
lover
she
had
gone
through
some
very
bitter
hours
since
her
tryst
at
the
ruins
the
process
of
cutting
off
a
malignant
growth
that
has
become
part
of
oneself
is
none
the
less
painful
because
the
conviction
is
clear
that
it
is
for
ones
health
to
do
so
and
the
will
is
firm
not
to
falter
not
the
less
is
the
flesh
mangled
do
nerves
throb
and
veins
bleed
but
madeleine
was
determined
that
nobody
should
even
guess
her
sufferings
rupert
had
counted
upon
sophias
old
habit
of
obedience
to
him
and
upon
her
superstitious
terrors
not
to
betray
to
the
young
girl
the
part
he
had
played
in
the
unmasking
of
her
lover
but
he
had
an
unexpected
and
even
more
powerful
ally
in
madeleines
own
pride
when
miss
sophia
had
tremblingly
endeavoured
to
falter
out
a
few
words
of
sympathy
and
sorrow
upon
the
distressing
subject
madeleine
quickly
interrupted
her
never
speak
even
his
name
again
sophia
all
that
is
finished
for
me
there
was
such
a
cold
finality
in
her
voice
that
the
poor
confidants
expansiveness
withered
up
within
her
beyond
even
the
hope
of
blossoming
again
when
rupert
heard
of
captain
jacks
latest
doings
and
especially
of
his
sisterinlaws
disappearance
he
thought
that
the
fates
were
propitious
indeed
in
his
wildest
schemes
he
could
not
have
planned
anything
that
would
have
suited
his
game
more
perfectly
though
he
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
pull
a
face
of
desperate
length
whenever
the
subject
was
touched
in
his
innermost
soul
he
had
hardly
ever
enjoyed
so
delightful
a
joke
as
this
dnouement
to
his
brothers
marriage
and
to
his
cousins
engagement
and
strange
to
say
though
he
would
most
gravely
protest
against
any
interpretation
of
his
kinswomans
disappearance
save
the
one
which
must
most
redound
to
her
credit
the
story
started
by
the
gossips
in
the
village
upon
the
return
of
the
revenue
men
that
lady
landale
had
bolted
with
the
handsome
smuggler
grew
and
spread
apace
all
over
the
county
more
especially
from
such
houses
as
rupert
was
wont
to
visit
that
all
his
hints
and
innuendoes
should
fail
apparently
to
make
madeleine
put
upon
the
case
the
interpretation
he
would
have
liked
was
at
once
a
matter
of
secret
sneering
and
of
admiration
to
his
curiously
complicated
mind
the
days
went
by
to
all
appearance
placidly
enough
for
the
trio
at
pulwick
madeleine
shunned
none
of
the
usages
of
life
in
common
worked
and
talked
with
sophia
of
a
morning
rode
or
walked
out
with
rupert
of
an
afternoon
and
passed
the
evening
at
her
embroidery
frame
meeting
his
efforts
to
entertain
her
as
amiably
as
before
rupert
thought
he
knew
enough
of
the
human
heart
and
more
especially
the
feminine
to
draw
satisfactory
conclusions
from
this
behaviour
for
a
girl
to
bear
no
malice
to
the
man
who
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
demonstrate
to
her
the
unworthiness
of
her
lover
argued
to
his
mind
that
her
affections
could
not
have
been
very
deeply
engaged
in
that
quarter
it
was
clear
that
she
felt
gratitude
for
a
timely
rescue
nay
might
he
not
go
further
and
lay
the
flattering
unction
to
his
soul
that
she
would
not
be
unwilling
to
transfer
these
same
blighted
feelings
to
a
more
suitable
recipient
a
slight
incident
which
took
place
a
few
nights
later
tended
still
more
to
increase
the
kindness
of
madeleines
manner
to
him
upon
the
next
day
but
this
was
for
a
reason
that
he
little
suspected
it
had
been
an
anniversary
with
sophianone
less
indeed
than
that
of
the
lamented
rectors
demise
when
her
young
cousin
had
retired
to
her
room
the
desire
to
pursue
her
thither
with
a
packet
of
old
letters
and
other
treasures
exhumed
from
the
depths
of
her
cupboards
had
proved
too
strong
for
a
soul
burning
for
congenial
sympathy
and
sophia
had
spent
a
couple
of
very
delightful
hours
pouring
forth
reminiscences
and
lamentations
into
the
bosom
of
one
who
as
she
said
she
knew
could
understand
her
madeleine
a
little
wearied
stifling
a
sigh
or
a
yawn
as
the
minutes
ticked
by
was
too
gentle
too
kindhearted
to
repel
the
faithful
if
loquacious
mourner
so
she
had
sat
and
listened
which
was
all
that
sophia
required
upon
the
stroke
of
twelve
miss
landale
rose
at
length
collected
her
relics
and
mopping
her
swollen
eyes
embraced
her
cousin
and
bade
her
goodnight
with
much
effusion
while
with
cordial
alacrity
the
latter
conducted
her
to
the
door
but
here
sophia
paused
holding
the
flat
silver
candlestick
with
one
hand
with
the
other
clasping
to
her
bosom
her
bundle
of
superannuated
love
letters
she
glanced
out
into
the
long
black
chasm
of
corridor
with
a
shudder
and
vowed
she
had
not
the
courage
to
traverse
it
alone
at
such
an
hour
she
cast
as
she
spoke
such
a
meaning
glance
at
madeleines
great
bed
that
trembling
lest
her
next
words
should
be
a
proposal
to
share
it
for
the
night
the
young
girl
hurriedly
volunteered
to
reconduct
her
to
her
own
apartment
half
way
down
the
passage
they
had
to
pass
the
door
of
the
picture
gallery
which
was
ajar
disclosing
light
within
at
the
sight
of
rupert
standing
with
his
back
to
them
looking
fixedly
at
the
picture
upon
the
opposite
wall
sophia
promptly
thought
better
of
the
scream
she
was
preparing
and
seized
her
cousin
by
the
arm
come
away
come
away
she
whispered
he
will
be
much
displeased
if
he
sees
us
madeleine
allowed
herself
to
be
pulled
onward
but
remembering
mollys
previous
encounter
upon
the
same
spot
was
curious
enough
to
demand
an
explanation
of
ruperts
nocturnal
rambles
when
they
had
reached
the
haven
of
sophias
bedroom
it
was
very
simple
but
it
struck
her
as
exceedingly
pathetic
and
confirmed
her
in
her
opinion
of
the
unreasonableness
of
her
sisters
dislike
to
rupert
he
was
gazing
at
his
dead
wifes
picture
he
could
not
bear
sophia
said
for
any
one
to
find
him
there
could
not
bear
the
smallest
allusion
to
his
grief
but
at
night
as
she
had
herself
discovered
quite
by
accident
he
would
often
spend
long
spells
as
they
had
just
seen
him
there
was
something
in
madeleines
own
nature
a
susceptible
proud
reserve
which
made
this
trait
in
her
cousins
character
thoroughly
congenial
moreover
what
woman
is
not
drawn
with
pity
towards
the
man
who
can
so
mourn
a
woman
she
met
him
therefore
the
next
day
with
a
softness
almost
a
tenderness
of
look
and
smile
which
roused
his
highest
hopes
and
when
he
proposed
after
breakfast
that
they
should
profit
by
the
mild
weather
to
stroll
in
the
garden
while
sophia
was
busy
in
the
house
she
willingly
consented
up
the
gravel
paths
between
the
gooseberry
bushes
to
the
violet
beds
they
went
it
was
one
of
those
balmy
days
that
come
sometimes
in
early
spring
and
encourage
all
sorts
of
false
hopes
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
vegetables
a
growing
day
the
farmers
call
them
indeed
at
such
times
you
may
almost
hear
the
swelling
and
the
bursting
of
the
buds
the
rising
of
the
sap
the
throbbing
and
pushing
of
the
young
green
life
all
around
madeleine
grew
hot
with
the
weight
of
her
fur
tippet
the
pale
face
under
the
plumy
hat
took
an
unusual
pink
bloom
her
eyes
shone
with
a
moist
radiance
rupert
glancing
up
at
her
as
bent
upon
one
knee
he
sought
for
stray
violets
amid
the
thick
green
leaves
thought
it
was
thus
a
maiden
looked
who
waited
to
be
won
and
though
all
of
true
love
that
he
could
ever
give
to
woman
lay
buried
with
his
little
bride
he
felt
his
pulses
quicken
with
a
certain
sthetic
pleasure
in
the
situation
presently
he
rose
and
after
arranging
his
bunch
of
purple
sweetness
into
dainty
form
offered
it
silently
to
his
companion
she
took
it
smiling
and
carried
it
mechanically
to
her
face
oh
the
scent
of
the
violets
upon
the
most
delicate
yet
mighty
pinions
she
was
carried
back
despite
all
her
proud
resolves
to
that
golden
hour
only
five
days
ago
when
she
lay
upon
her
lovers
broad
breast
and
heard
the
beating
of
his
heart
beneath
her
ear
again
she
felt
his
arm
around
her
so
strong
yet
so
gentle
saw
his
handsome
face
bent
towards
her
closerever
closerfelt
again
the
tide
of
joy
that
coursed
through
her
veins
in
the
expectation
of
his
kiss
no
no
she
must
notshe
would
not
yield
to
this
degrading
folly
if
it
were
not
yet
dead
then
she
must
kill
it
she
had
first
grown
pale
but
the
next
moment
a
deep
crimson
flooded
her
face
she
turned
her
head
away
and
rupert
saw
her
tremble
as
she
dropped
the
hand
that
held
the
flowers
close
clenched
by
her
side
he
formed
his
own
opinion
of
what
was
passing
within
her
and
it
made
even
his
cold
blood
course
hotly
in
his
veins
madeleine
he
said
with
low
rapid
utterance
i
am
not
mistaken
i
trust
in
thinking
you
look
on
me
as
a
good
friend
indeed
yes
answered
the
girl
with
an
effort
turning
her
tremulous
face
towards
him
a
good
friend
indeed
had
he
not
been
so
five
days
ago
aye
most
truly
and
she
would
have
it
so
in
spite
of
the
hungry
voice
within
her
which
had
awaked
and
cried
out
against
the
knowledge
that
had
brought
such
misery
he
saw
her
set
her
little
teeth
and
toss
her
head
and
knew
she
was
thinking
of
the
adventurer
who
had
dared
aspire
to
her
and
he
gained
warmer
courage
still
nothing
more
than
a
friend
sweet
a
kind
cousin
almost
a
brother
no
no
not
a
brother
madeleine
nay
hear
me
taking
her
hands
and
looking
into
her
uncomprehending
eyes
i
would
not
be
a
brother
but
something
closer
dearer
we
are
both
alone
in
the

more
or
less

have
you

make
of
it

i
have
learned
to
love
you
deeply
his
eyes
glowed
between
their
narrowing
eyelids
his
voice
rang
changes
upon
chords
of
most
exquisite
tenderness
his
whole
manner
was
charged
with
a
courtly
reverence
mingled
with
the
subtlest
hint
of
passion
rupert
as
a
lover
had
not
a
flaw
in
him
yet
fear
suspicion
disgust
chased
each
other
in
madeleines
mind
in
quick
succession
what
did
he
mean
how
could
it
be
that
he
loved
her
oh
if
this
had
been
his
purpose
what
motive
was
prompting
him
when
he
divided
her
from
her
deceiving
lover
was
no
one
true
then
was
this
the
inconsolable
widower
whose
grief
she
had
been
so
sympathetically
considering
all
the
morning
for
whose
disinterested
anxiety
and
solicitude
on
her
behalf
her
sore
heart
had
forced
itself
to
render
gratitude
oh
how
terrible
it
all
was

what
a
hateful
world
well
madeleine
he
pressed
forward
and
slid
his
arm
around
her
all
her
powers
of
thought
and
action
restored
by
the
deed
she
disengaged
herself
with
a
movement
of
unconscious
repulsion

i
am
sure
you

kindly
by
me
but
it
is
quite
impossiblei

he
drew
back
as
nonplussed
as
if
she
had
struck
him
in
the
face
pshaw
my
dear
madeleine
please
cousin
rupert
no
more
my
dear

i
have
been
precipitate
nothing
can
make
any
difference
that
i
could
never

you
so
much
you
must
believe
that

shall
never

at
all
you
are
free
to
believe

not
as
you

i
am
sorry
you
should
have
spoken
still
hankering
after
that
beggarly
scoundrel
muttered
rupert
a
sneer
uncovering
his
teeth
betrayed
hideously
the
ungenerous
soul
within
he
was
too
deeply
mortified
too
shaken
by
this
utter
shattering
of
his
last
ambitions
to
be
able
to
grasp
his
usual
selfcontrol
madeleine
gave
him
one
proud
glance
turned
abruptly
away
and
walked
into
the
house
she
went
steadily
up
to
her
room
and
once
there
without
hesitation
proceeded
to
unlock
a
drawer
in
her
writingtable
and
draw
from
it
a
little
ribbontied
parcel
of
lettersjacks
letters
her
heart
had
failed
her
womanlike
before
the
little
sacrifice
when
she
had
unshrinkingly
accomplished
the
larger
one
now
however
with
determined
hand
she
threw
the
letters
into
the
reddest
cavern
of
her
woodfire
and
with
hard
dry
eyes
watched
them
burn
when
the
last
scrap
had
writhed
and
fluttered
and
flamed
into
grey
ash
she
turned
to
her
altar
and
extending
her
arm
called
out
aloud
i
have
done
with
it
all
for
ever
and
the
next
instant
flinging
herself
upon
her
bed
she
drew
her
brown
ringlets
before
her
face
and
under
this
veil
wept
for
her
broken
youth
and
her
broken
heart
and
the
hard
cold
life
before
her





there
is
a
kind
of
love
a
man
can
give
to
woman
but
once
in
his
lifetime
the
love
of
the
man
in
the
first
flush
of
manhood
for
the
woman
he
has
chosen
to
be
his
mate
untransferable
and
never
to
be
forgotten
love
of
passion
so
exquisite
of
devotion
so
pure
born
of
the
youth
of
the
heart
and
belonging
to
an
existence
and
personality
lost
for
ever
a
man
may
wed
again
and
some
say
love
again
but
between
the
boards
of
the
coffin
of
his
first
wifeif
he
has
loved
herlie
secrets
of
tenderness
and
sweetness
and
delight
which
like
the
spring
flowers
may
not
visit
the
later
year
but
notwithstanding
this
a
second
wooing
may
have
a
charm
and
an
interest
of
its
own
even
the
wooing
which
is
to
precede
a
marriage
of
convenience
so
rupert
found
the
thought
of
an
alliance
with
madeleine
de
savenaye
was
not
only
engrossing
from
the
sense
of
its
own
intrinsic
advantages
but
had
become
the
actual
foundationstone
of
all
his
new
schemes
of
ambition
nay
more
such
admiration
and
desire
as
he
could
still
feel
for
woman
he
had
gradually
come
to
centre
upon
his
fair
and
graceful
cousin
who
added
to
her
personal
attractions
the
other
indispensable
attributes
blood
breeding
and
fortune
mr
landale
was
as
essentially
refined
and
fastidious
in
his
judgment
as
he
was
unmeasured
in
his
ambition
his
error
of
precipitancy
had
been
pardonable
enough
and
mere
selfreproach
for
an
illconsidered
manoeuvre
would
not
have
sufficed
to
plunge
him
into
such
a
depth
of
bitter
and
angry
despondency
as
that
in
which
he
now
found
himself
but
the
rebuff
had
been
too
uncompromising
to
leave
him
a
single
hope
he
was
too
shrewd
not
to
see
that
here
was
no
pretty
feminine
nay
precursor
of
the
yielding
yea
not
to
realise
that
madeleine
had
meant
what
she
said
and
would
abide
by
it
and
under
the
sting
of
the
moment
betrayed
into
a
degradingly
illmannered
outburst
he
had
shown
that
he
measured
the
full
bearings
of
the
position
so
the
wind
still
sat
in
that
quarter
failing
the
mysterious
smuggler
it
was
to
be
nobody
with
the
savenaye
heiressand
least
of
all
rupert
landale
and
this
though
the
scoundrel
had
been
thoroughly
shown
up
though
he
had
started
upon
his
illegal
venture
and
was
gone
never
to
return
if
he
valued
his
neck
after
murdering
four
officers
of
the
crown
and
sinking
a
kings
vessel
though
he
had
carried
away
with
him
ah
there
was
consolation
in
that
excellent
jest
which
had
so
far
developed
into
sir
adrians
wild
goose
chase
to
france
and
might
still
hold
some
delicate
dnouement
had
carried
with
him
no
less
a
person
than
lady
landale
herself
the
fellow
had
good
taste
and
either
of
the
sisters
was
a
dainty
morsel
he
still
left
the
baneful
trail
of
his
influence
behind
him
upon
the
girl
he
had
deluded
and
beguiled
rupert
landale
who
for
motives
of
his
own
had
pleased
himself
by
hunting
down
madeleines
lover
had
felt
in
the
keenness
of
his
bloodhound
work
something
of
the
bloodhound
instinct
of
destruction
and
ferocity
spring
up
within
him
before
he
had
even
set
eyes
on
his
quarry
and
the
day
they
had
stood
face
to
face
this
instinctive
hatred
had
been
intensified
by
some
singular
natural
antagonism
added
to
this
there
was
now
personal
injury
and
the
prey
was
out
of
reach
impotence
for
revenge
burned
into
the
soul
of
him
like
a
corrosive
poison
oh
let
him
but
come
within
his
grip
again
and
he
should
not
escape
so
easily
sits
the
wind
still
in
that
quarter
the
burthen
droned
in
his
head
angry
conclusion
to
each
long
spell
of
inconclusive
thought
as
he
still
paced
the
garden
till
the
noon
hour
began
to
wane
and
it
was
in
this
mood
that
at
length
returning
to
his
study
he
crossed
in
one
of
the
back
passages
a
young
woman
enveloped
in
a
brilliant
scarlet
and
black
shawl
who
started
in
evident
dismay
on
being
confronted
with
him
rupert
knew
by
sight
and

every
wench
of

dames
whom
business
brought
periodically
to
the
great
hall
that
this
person
was
neither
of
the
household
nor
one
of
the
usual
backdoor
visitors
he
would
have
seen
at
a
glance
even
had
not
her
own
embarrassment
drawn
his
closer
attention
he
looked
keenly
and
recognised
the
gatekeepers
daughter
moggie
having
married
sir
adrians
servant
and
withdrawn
to
take
up
her
abode
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
so
to
speak
she
was
not
one
whom
mr
landale
would
have
regarded
with
favour
in
any
case
but
now
concentrating
his
thoughts
from
their
aimless
whirl
of
dissatisfaction
upon
the
present
encounter
he
was
struck
by
the
womans
manner
yes
she
was
most
undoubtedly
frightened
he
examined
her
with
a
malevolent
eye
which
still
discountenanced
her
and
though
he
made
no
inquiry
she
forthwith
stammered
out
ii
came
sir
to
see
if
there
be
news
of
her
ladyship

or
of
sir
adrian
sirrenny
cant
leave
the
island
you
know
and
he
be
downright
anxious
well
my
good
woman
calm
yourself
nothing
wrong
nothing
to
hide
in
this
very
laudable
anxiety
of
you
and
your
good
man
no
we
have
no
news
yetthat
is
quickly
told
mrs
potter
he
kept
her
for
a
moment
quailing
and
scared
under
his
cruel
gaze
then
went
on
his
way
working
upon
the
new
problems
she
had
brought
him
to
solve
no
matter
was
too
small
for
ruperts
mind
he
knew
how
inextricably
the
most
minute
and
apparently
insignificant
may
be
connected
with
the
most
important
events
of
life
the
woman
was
singularly
anxious
to
explain
reflected
he
pausing
at
his
chamber
door
singularly
ready
with
her
explanationtoo
ready
she
must
have
lied
no
doubt
she
lied
liar
was
written
upon
every
line
of
the
terrified
face
of
her
what
was
that
infernal
little
french
husband
of
hers
hatching
now
he
had
been
in
the
smith
plot
of
course
ah
curse
that
smuggling
fellow
he
cropped
up
still
on
every
side
pray
the
fates
he
would
crop
up
once
too
often
for
his
own
safety
yet
who
knew
meanwhile
mrs
potter
the
innocent
newsgatherer
must
not
be
allowed
to
roam
unwatched
at
her
own
sweet
will
about
the
place
hark
what
clumping
creaking
steps
these
could
only
be
produced
by
rens
fairyfooted
spouse
the
house
servants
had
been
too
well
drilled
by
his
irritable
ear
to
venture
in
such
shoe
leather
within
its
range
he
closed
his
door
and
gently
walked
back
along
the
corridor
as
he
passed
mollys
apartment
he
could
hear
the
creaking
of
a
wardrobe
door
and
a
startling
surmise
springing
into
his
brain
he
quietly
slipped
into
an
opposite
room
and
waited
leaving
the
door
slightly
ajar
as
he
expected
a
few
minutes
later
moggie
reappeared
loaded
with
a
bulky
parcel
glancing
anxiously
right
and
left
she
tiptoed
by
him
but
after
a
few
steps
suddenly
turning
her
head
once
more
met
his
eyes
grimly
fixed
upon
her
through
the
narrow
aperture
with
a
faint
squeal
she
paddled
off
as
though
a
fiend
were
at
her
heels
something
more
than
anxiety
for
news
there
mrs
potter
said
mr
landale
apostrophising
the
retreating
figure
with
a
malignant
inward
laugh
then
when
the
last
echo
of
her
stout
boots
had
faded
away
he
entered
his
sisterinlaws
room
looked
around
and
meditatively
began
to
open
various
presses
and
drawers
you
visited
this
one
at
any
rate
my
girl
thought
he
as
he
recognised
the
special
sound
of
the
hinges
and
for
a
ladys
maid
you
have
left
it
in
singular
disorder
as
for
this
pulling
open
a
linen
drawer
halfemptied
and
showing
dainty
feminine
apparel
beribboned
and
belaced
in
the
most
utter
disorderwhy
fie
on
you
mrs
potter
is
this
the
way
to
treat
these
pretty
things
he
had
seen
enough
he
paused
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
nails
to
his
lips
smiling
to
himself
ah
mrs
potter
i
fancy
you
might
have
given
us
a
little
news
yourself
most
unkind
of
my
lady
landale
to
prefer
to
keep
us
in
this
unnatural
anxietymost
unkind
indeed
she
must
have
singularly
good
reasons
for
so
doing
captain
smith
my
friend
mr
cochrane
or
whatever
may
be
your
name
we
have
an
account
to
settle
and
there
is
that
fool
of
an
adrian
scurrying
over
the
seas
in
search
of
his
runaway
wife
by
george
my
hand
is
not
played
out
yet
slowly
he
repaired
to
his
study
there
he
sat
down
and
wrote
without
any
further
reflection
an
urgent
letter
to
the
chief
officer
of
the
newly
established
preventive
service
station
then
he
rang
the
bell
one
of
the
grooms
will
ride
at
once
to
lancaster
with
this
he
said
to
the
servant
looking
at
the
missive
in
his
hand
but
instead
of
delivering
it
he
paused
a
new
idea
had
occurred
how
many
of
these
servants
might
not
be
leagued
in
favour
of
that
interloper
bribed
or
knowing
him
perhaps
to
have
been
a
friend
of
sir
adrian
or
yet
again
out
of
sheer
spite
to
himself
no
he
would
leave
no
loophole
for
treachery
now
send
the
groom
to
me
as
soon
as
he
is
ready
he
continued
and
when
the
footman
had
withdrawn
enclosed
the
letter
with
its
taletelling
superscription
in
another
directed
to
a
local
firm
of
attorneys
with
a
covering
note
instructing
them
to
see
that
the
communication
on
his
majestys
service
should
reach
the
proper
hands
without
delay
when
the
messenger
had
set
forth
mr
landale
on
his
side
had
his
horse
saddled
and
sallied
out
in
the
direction
of
scarthey
sands
as
from
the
top
of
the
bluff
he
took
a
survey
of
the
great
bay
a
couple
of
figures
crossing
the
strand
in
the
distance
arrested
his
attention
he
reined
in
his
horse
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
and
watched
so
ho
mrs
potter
your
careful
husband
could
not
leave
the
island
muttered
he
as
he
marked
the
unmistakable
squat
figure
of
the
one
a
man
carrying
a
burden
upon
his
shoulder
whilst
enveloping
the
woman
who
walked
briskly
by
his
side
flared
the
brillianthued
shawl
of
moggie
that
lie
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
to
arouse
suspicion
hallo
what
is
the
damned
crapaud
up
to
the
question
was
suggested
by
the
mans
movements
as
after
returning
the
parcel
to
his
consort
at
the
beginning
of
the
now
bare
causeway
he
turned
tail
while
she
trudged
forward
alone
the
shearmans
house
i
thought
as
much
out
he
comes
again
and
not
by
himself
i
have
made
acquaintance
with
those
small
bare
legs
before
i
should
have
been
astonished
indeed
if
none
of
the
shearman
fellows
had
been
mixed
up
with
the
affair
i
shall
be
even
yet
with
those
creditable
friends
of
yours
brother
adrian
so
its
you
again
johnny
my
lad
the
pretty
mercury
can
it
be
possible
that
captain
smith
is
at
his
old
games
once
more
mr
landales
eyes
shone
with
a
curious
eager
light
he
laughed
a
little
mirthless
laugh
which
was
neither
pleasant
to
hear
nor
to
give
dear
me
he
said
aloud
as
he
watched
the
pair
tramp
together
towards
scarthey
for
plotters
in
the
dark
you
are
particularly
easy
to
detect
my
good
friends
then
he
checked
himself
realising
what
a
mere
chance
it
had
been
after
alla
fortuitous
meeting
in
the
passagethat
had
first
aroused
his
suspicions
and
placed
between
his
fingers
the
end
of
the
thread
he
now
thought
it
so
simple
to
follow
up
but
he
did
hold
the
thread
and
depended
no
longer
upon
chance
or
guesswork
but
on
his
own
relentless
purpose
to
lay
the
plotters
by
the
heels
whatever
their
plot
might
be
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
johnny
shearman
whistling
lighthearted
and
alone
was
nearing
his
native
house
once
more
when
the
sight
of
a
horseman
rapidly
advancing
across
the
sands
brought
him
to
a
standstill
to
stare
with
a
boys
curiosity
presently
however
recognising
mr
landalea
person
for
whom
he
had
more
dread
than
admirationhe
was
starting
off
homeward
again
at
a
brisk
canter
when
a
stern
hail
from
the
rider
arrested
him
johnny
the
boy
debated
a
moment
measured
the
distance
between
the
cottage
and
himself
and
shrewdly
recognised
the
advisability
of
obeying
johnny
my
boy
i
want
you
at
the
hall
take
hold
of
my
stirrup
and
come
along
with
me
the
boy
with
every
symptom
of
reluctance
demurred
pleading
a
promise
to
return
to
his
mother
then
he
suddenly
perceived
a
look
in
the
gentlemans
eye
which
gave
him
a
frantic
unreasoned
desire
to
bolt
at
once
and
at
any
cost
but
the
horseman
anticipated
the
thought
bending
in
the
saddle
he
reached
out
his
arm
and
seized
the
urchin
by
the
collar
why
you
little
devil
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
grinning
ominously
into
the
chubby
terrified
face
it
strikes
me
it
is
time
you
and
i
should
come
to
a
little
understanding
any
more
letters
from
the
smuggler
today
eh
ah
would
you
you
young
idiot
and
mr
landales
fingers
gave
a
sudden
twist
to
the
collar
which
strangled
the
rising
yell
listen
johnny
tightening
his
grasp
gradually
until
the
brown
face
grew
scarlet
then
purple
and
the
goggling
eyes
seemed
to
start
out
of
their
sockets
that
is
what
it
feels
like
to
be
hanged
they
squeeze
your
neck
so
and
they
leave
you
dangling
at
the
end
of
a
rope
till
you
are
dead
dead
dead
and
the
crows
come
and
eat
you
do
you
want
to
be
hanged
for
some
moments
more
he
kept
the
writhing
lad
under
the
torture
then
loosening
his
grip
without
however
relinquishing
his
hold
allowed
him
to
taste
once
more
the
living
air
do
you
want
to
be
hanged
johnny
shearman
he
asked
again
gravely
the
lad
burst
into
gasping
sobs
and
looked
up
at
his
captor
with
an
agony
of
fear
in
his
bloodshot
eyes
no
continued
mr
landale
i
am
sure
you
dont
eh
with
a
renewed
ominous
contraction
of
the
hand
its
a
fearful
thing
is
hanging
and
yet
many
a
lad
hardly
older
than
you
has
been
hanged
for
less
than
you
are
doing
magistrates
can
get
people
hanged
and
i
am
a
magistrate
you
know
stop
that
noise
now
continued
the
gentleman
there
are
one
or
two
little
things
i
want
to
know
myself
johnny
and
its
just
possible
i
might
let
you
off
for
this
time
if
by
chance
you
were
able
to
tell
them
to
me
so
for
your
sake
i
hope
you
may
be
he
could
see
that
the
boys
mind
was
now
completely
turned
with
fright
if
you
were
to
try
to
run
away
again
i
should
know
you
had
secrets
to
keep
from
me
and
then
johnny
shearman
it
would
go
hard
with
you
indeed
now
come
along
beside
me
up
to
the
hall
quite
certain
of
his
prey
he
released
him
and
setting
his
horse
to
a
trot
smiled
to
note
the
desperate
clutch
of
the
lad
upon
his
stirrup
leather
as
with
the
perspiration
dripping
from
his
face
and
panting
breath
he
struggled
to
keep
up
the
pace
alongside
marched
with
tremendous
ceremony
into
the
magistrates
study
and
directed
to
stand
right
opposite
the
light
while
mr
landale
installed
himself
in
an
armchair
with
a
bloodcurdling
air
of
judicial
sternness
johnny
shearman
at
most
times
as
daredevil
a
pickle
of
a
boy
as
ever
ran
but
now
reduced
to
a
state
of
mental
and
physical
jelly
underwent
a
terrible
crossexamination
it
was
comparatively
little
that
he
had
to
say
and
no
doubt
he
wished
most
fervently
he
had
greater
revelations
to
make
and
could
thus
propitiate
the
arbiter
of
the
appalling
fate
he
firmly
believed
might
lie
in
store
for
him
meagre
as
his
narrative
was
however
it
quite
sufficed
for
mr
landale
i
think
johnny
he
said
more
pleasantly
well
knowing
the
inducement
that
a
sudden
relaxation
from
fear
offers
to
a
witnesss
garrulity
i
think
i
may
say
you
will
not
hang
this
timethat
is
with
a
sudden
hardening
of
his

there
was
a
special
cell
off
the
official
study
with
high
windows
bolts
and
bars
and
a
wooden
bench
for
the

desperate
criminals
as

to
the
judgment

there
he
now
disposed
of
the
young

snivelled
piteously
once
more
and
having
locked
the

the

returned
to
his
capacious
armchair
where
as
the
twilight
waned
over
the
land
he
fell
to
coordinating
his
scheme

gloating
upon
this
unexpected
turn
of
fortunes
wheel





at
that
hour
madeleine
alone
in
her
chamber
knelt
before
her
little
altar
wrestling
with
the
rebellion
of
her
soul
and
besieging
the
heavens
with
a
cry
for
peace





sir
adrian
having
failed
to
hear
aught
of
the
peregrine
at

with
harassing
doubt
about

on

up

sat
captain

smoking
a
pipe

so

silent
as
to

lady
landale
torn
between
the
dread
of
a
final
separation
from
the
loadstar
of
her
existence
and
the
gnawing
anxiety
roused
in
her
bosom
by
moggies
account
of
mr

watchfulness
was
pacing
the
long
booklined
room
with
the
restlessness
of
a
caged
panther





on
the
road
from
lancaster
to
pulwick
a
posse
of
riding
officers
and
a
carriage
full
of
hastily
gathered
preventive
men
were
trotting
on
their
way
to
the
priory
chapter
xxix
the
light
goes
out
the
light
of
scarthey
had
not
been
shining
for
quite
an
hour
over
the
wilderness
when
lady
landale
suddenly
breaking
the
chain
of
her
restless
tramp
ran
to
the
door
and
called
for
moggie
there
was
so
shrill
a
tone
of
anguish
in
the
summons
that
the
young
woman
rushed
into
the
room
in
trembling
expectancy
yet
it
was
to
find
her
mistress
alone
and
the
place
undisturbed
moggie
said
lady
landale
panting
and
pressing
her
hands
upon
her
side
as
if
in
the
endeavour
to
control
the
beating
of
her
heart
something
is
going
to
happen
i
know
it
i
feel
it
tell
captain
smith
that
i
must
speak
to
him
here
at
once
infected
by
the
terror
upon
her
mistresss
face
madame
laptre
flew
upon
her
errand
a
moment
later
captain
jack
entered
the
room
and
stood
before
lady
landale
with
a
look
of
impatient
inquiry
oh
it
is
wicked
it
is
mad
cried
she
passionately
it
is
tempting
god
to
remain
here
of
whom
are
you
speaking
he
asked
with
an
involuntary
glance
of
contempt
at
the
distracted
figure
if
it
is
of
yourself
i
entirely
concur
how
often
these
last
days
and
how
earnestly
have
i
not
begged
of
you
to
return
to
pulwick
was
not
the
situation
you
placed
me
in
with
regard
to
adrian
already
odious
enough
that
it
needed
this
added
folly
oh
i
knowi
know
what
you
would
say
spare
it
me
my
safety
you
fear
for
me
ah
lady
landale
that
you
could
have
but
left
me
in
peace
he
had
waxed
hot
with
anger
from
his
first
wouldbe
calmness
as
he
spoke
this
dismal
life
of
close
but
inharmonious
proximity
started
upon
the
seas
and
continued
under
his
absent
friends
own
roof
had
tried
his
impetuous
temper
to
the
utmost
upon
the
morrow
of
their
return
he
had
indeed
exercised
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
lady
landale
to
proceed
to
the
priory
but
impelled
by
her
frantic
dread
of
the
separation
and
entrenching
herself
behind
the
argument
that
her
mysterious
reappearance
would
awaken
suspicion
where
people
would
otherwise
believe
the
peregrine
still
in
foreign
parts
she
had
declared
her
irrevocable
determination
not
to
quit
the
island
until
she
knew
him
to
be
safe
and
he
had
remained
actuated
by
the
dual
desire
first
to
exonerate
himself
personally
in
her
husbands
eyes
from
any
possible
suspicion
of
complicity
in
mollys
flightthe
bare
thought
of
which
had
become
a
horrible
torment
to
himthen
to
encompass
through
that
good
friends
means
an
interview
and
full
explanation
with
madeleine
which
not
only
the
most
ordinary
precaution
for
his
life
but
likewise
every
instinct
of
pride
forbade
him
now
to
seek
himself
thus
began
a
state
of
affairs
which
as
the
days
succeeded
each
other
without
news
of
sir
adrian
became
every
moment
more
intolerable
to
his
loyalty
the
inaction
the
solitary
hours
of
reflection
the
maddening
feeling
of
unavailing
proximity
to
his
hearts
dearest
of
impotency
against
the
involving
meshes
of
the
present
false
and
hateful
position
all
this
had
brought
into
the
young
mans
soul
a
fever
of
anger
which
as
fevers
will
consumed
him
the
more
fiercely
because
of
his
vigour
and
strength
it
was
with
undisguised
hatred
and
with
scorn
immeasurable
that
he
now
surveyed
the
woman
who
had
degraded
him
in
his
own
eyes
at
another
time
molly
might
have
yielded
before
his
resentment
but
at
this
hour
her
whole
being
was
encompassed
by
a
single
thought
it
is
for
youfor
you
she
repeated
with
ashen
lips
you
must
go
before
it
is
too
late
and
is
it
not
too
late
stormed
he
too
late
indeed
do
i
see
my
treachery
to
adrian
my
more
than
brother
upon
my
ship
i
could
not
avoid
your
company
but
hereoh
i
should
have
thought
of
him
and
not
of
myself
and
done
as
my
honour
bade
me
you
are
right
since
you
would
not
go
i
should
have
done
so
it
was
weak
it
was
mad
worse
worsedishonourable
but
she
had
no
ears
for
his
reproaches
no
power
to
feel
the
wounds
he
dealt
her
womans
heart
with
such
relentless
hand
then
you
will
go
she
cried
tell
ren
the
signal
he
started
and
looked
at
her
with
a
different
expression
have
you
heard
anything
has
anything
happened
he
asked
recovering
selfrestraint
at
the
thought
of
danger
not
yet
she
replied
not
yet
but
it
is
coming
her
look
and
voice
were
so
charged
with
tragic
force
that
for
the
moment
he
was
impressed
and
brave
man
though
he
was
felt
a
little
cold
thrill
run
down
his
spine
she
continued
in
accents
of
the
most
piercing
misery
and
it
will
have
been
through
meit
will
have
been
through
me
oh
in
mercy
let
me
make
the
signal
say
you
will
go
tonight
i
will
go
there
followed
a
little
pause
of
breathless
silence
between
them
then
as
without
speaking
he
would
have
turned
away
a
loud
peremptory
knock
resounded
upon
the
door
of
the
keep
and
echoed
and
reechoed
with
lugubrious
reverberation
through
the
old
stone
passages
around
them
at
first
terrorstricken
her
tongue
clave
to
her
palate
her
feet
were
rooted
to
the
ground
then
with
a
scream
she
flung
herself
upon
him
and
would
have
dragged
him
towards
the
door
they
have
comehidehide
he
threw
up
his
head
to
listen
while
he
strove
to
disengage
himself
the
blood
had
leaped
to
his
cheek
and
fire
to
his
eye
and
if
it
be
adrian
he
cried
another
knock
thundered
through
the
still
air
it
is
but
one
man
cried
ren
from
his
tower
down
the
stairs
you
may
open
moggie
nono
screamed
molly
beside
herself
and
tighter
clasped
her
arms
round
captain
jacks
neck
adrian
it
is
adrian
said
he
hush
madam
let
me
go
would
you
make
the
breach
between
me
and
my
friend
irreparable
both
his
hands
were
on
her
wrists
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
disengage
himself
from
her
frenzied
grip
the
door
was
flung
open
and
rupert
landale
stood
in
the
opening
and
looked
in
upon
them
damnation
muttered
jack
between
his
teeth
and
flung
her
from
him
stamping
his
foot
rupert
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
from
the
woman
who
haggard
and
dishevelled
now
turned
like
a
fury
upon
him
to
the
sailors
fierce
erect
figure
then
he
closed
the
door
with
an
air
of
grave
deliberation
what
do
you
want
demanded
mollyyou
have
come
here
for
no
good
purpose
what
do
you
want
as
she
spoke
she
strove
to
place
herself
between
the
two
men
i
came
my
dear
sisterinlaw
said
rupert
in
his
coldest
most
incisive
voice
to
learn
why
since
you
have
come
back
from
your
little
trip
you
choose
to
remain
in
the
ruins
rather
than
return
to
your
own
house
and
family
the
reason
is
clear
to
see
now
my
poor
brother
the
revulsion
of
disappointment
had
added
to
the
wrath
which
the
very
sight
of
rupert
landale
aroused
in
jack
smiths
blood
this
insinuation
was
the
culminating
injury
he
took
a
step
forward
have
a
care
sir
he
exclaimed
how
you
outrage
in
my
presence
the
wife
of
my
best
friend
have
a
carei
am
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
leave
you
as
when
last
we
met
mr
landale
raised
his
eyebrows
and
again
sent
a
look
from
molly
back
to
the
sailor
the
insolence
of
which
lashed
beyond
all
control
the
devils
in
the
sailors
soul
we
have
an
account
to
settle
it
seems
to
me
mr
landale
said
he
taking
another
step
forward
and
slightly
stooping
his
head
to
look
the
other
in
the
eye
crimson
fury
was
in
his
own
i
doubt
much
whether
it
was
quite
wise
of
you
assuming
that
you
expected
to
find
me
here
to
have
come
without
that
pistolling
retinue
with
which
you
provided
yourself
last
time
rupert
smiled
and
crossed
his
arms
cowardice
was
no
part
of
his
character
he
had
come
in
advance
of
his
bloodhounds
in
part
to
assure
himself
of
the
correctness
of
his
surmises
but
also
to
feast
upon
the
discomfiture
of
this
man
and
this
woman
whom
he
hated
to
have
found
them
together
and
thus
had
been
an
unforeseen
and
delicious
addition
to
his
dish
of
vengeance
and
he
would
linger
over
it
while
he
could
well
captain
smith
and
about
this
account
lady
landale
i
beg
of
you
be
silent
you
have
brought
sufficient
disgrace
upon
our
name
as
it
is
nay
sir
raising
his
voice
it
is
useless
to
shake
your
head
at
me
in
this
furious
style
nothing
can
alter
facts
i
saw
who
has
an
account
to
demand
thenyou
whose
life
is
already
forfeit
for
an
accumulation
of
crimes
you
screened
by
a
conspiracy
of
bribed
servants
and

your
best
friends

you
dare

cried

the

face
sternly
and
sadly
rebuking
was
not
proof
against
the
exquisite
aptness
of
this
proposal
his
men
outside
were
waiting
for
the

again
but
how
to
make
it
without
creating
suspicion
had
not
yet
suggested
itself
to
his
fertile
brain
now
while
he
held
her
lover
in
play
molly
would
herself
deliver
him
to
justice
excellent
excellent
truly
life
held
some
delightful
jokes
for
the
man
of
humour
the
light
of
triumph
came
and
went
upon
his
countenance
like
a
flash
but
when
the
life
hangs
upon
the
decision
of
a
moment
the
wits
become
abnormally
sharp
jack
smith
saw
it
halted
upon
his
second
headlong
onslaught
and
turned
roundtoo
late
molly
was
gone
he
brought
his
gaze
back
upon
his
enemy
and
saw
he
had
been
trapped
their
gleams
met
like
duelling
blades
divining
each
others
purpose
with
the
rapidity
of
thrust
answering
thrust
both
made
a
leap
for
the
door
but
rupert
was
nearest
he
first
had
his
hand
on
the
key
and
turned
it
and
with
newlyborn
genius
of
fight
suddenly
begotten
of
his
hatred
quickly
stooped
eluded
the
advancing
grasp
was
free
for
one
second
and
sent
the
key
crashing
through
the
window
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
baffled
by
the
astounding
swiftness
of
the
act
the
sailor
wheeling
round
had
already
raised
his
fist
to
crush
his
feebler
foe
when
in
the
midst
of
his
fury
a
glimmer
of
the
allimportance
of
every
second
of
time
stayed
his
hand
he
threw
himself
upon
the
heavy
ladder
that
rested
against
sir
adrians
rows
of
books
and
clasping
it
by
the
middle
swung
it
above
his
head
the
battering
blow
would
no
doubt
have
burst
panel
lock
and
hinges
the
next
instant
but
again
rupert
forestalled
him
and
charged
him
before
the
door
could
be
reached
overbalanced
by
the
weight
he
held
aloft
captain
jack
was
hurled
down
headlong
beneath
the
ladder
and
lay
for
a
moment
stunned
by
the
violence
of
the
fall
when
the
clouds
cleared
away
it
was
to
let
him
see
ruperts
face
bending
over
him
his
pale
lips
wreathed
into
a
smile
of
malignant
exultation
caught
said
mr
landale
slowly
pausing
over
each
word
as
though
to
prolong
the
savour
of
it
in
his
mouth
caught
this
time
and
it
is
your
mistresss
hand
that
puts
the
noose
round
your
neck
that
is
what
i
call
poetical
justice
the
prostrate
man
collecting
his
scattered
wits
and
his
vast
strength
made
a
violent
effort
to
spring
to
his
feet
but
ruperts
whole
weight
was
upon
him
his
long
thin
fingers
were
gripping
him
by
each
shoulder
his
face
grinned
at
him
close
detested
infuriating
the
grasp
that
held
him
seemed
to
belong
to
no
flesh
and
blood
it
was
as
the
grasp
of
skeleton
hands
the
grinning
face
became
like
a
deaths
head
i
shall
come
to
your
hanging
captain
jack
smith
or
rather
mr
hubert
cochrane
of
the
shaws
these
were
the
last
words
of
rupert
landale
a
red
whirl
passed
through
the
sailors
brain
his
hands
fell
like
lashes
round
the
others
neck
and
drew
it
down
if
hubert
cochrane
dies
so
does
rupert
landale
that
throat
shall
never
give
sound
to
that
name
again
over
and
over
they
roll
like
savage
beasts
but
yet
in
deathly
silence
for
the
pressure
of
the
fingers
on
his
gullet
fingers
that
seem
to
gain
fresh
strength
every
moment
and
pierce
into
his
very
flesh
will
not
allow
even
a
sigh
to
pass
ruperts
lips
and
jack
can
spare
no
atom
of
his
energy
from
the
fury
of
fight
not
one
to
spare
even
for
the
hearing
of
the
frantic
knocks
at
the
door
the
calls
the
hammering
at
the
lock
the
desperate
efforts
without
to
prise
it
open
but
if
rupert
landale
must
die
so
shall
hubert
cochrane
and
by
the
hangmans
hand
treble
doomed
by
this
the
same
thought
fills
both
these
mens
heads
the
devil
of
murder
has
possession
of
both
their
souls
but
true
to
himself
to
the
last
it
is
with
rupert
a
calculating
devil
the
officers
must
soon
be
here
he
will
hold
the
scoundrel
yet
with
the
grasp
of
death
and
his
enemy
shall
be
found
redhandedredhanded
his
hatred
his
determination
of
vengeance
the
very
agony
of
the
unequal
struggle
for
life
gave
him
a
power
that
is
almost
a
match
for
the
young
athlete
in
his
frenzy
the
dying
efforts
of
his
victim
tax
jacks
strength
more
than
the
living
fight
but
his
hands
are
still
locked
in
their
fatal
clutch
when
at
last
with
one
fearful
and
spasmodic
jerk
rupert
landale
falls
motionless
then
exhaustion
enwraps
the
conqueror
also
like
a
mantle
he
too
lies
motionless
with
his
cheek
on
the
floor
face
to
face
with
the
corpse
dimly
conscious
of
the
voluptuousness
of
victory
but
the
dead
grasp
still
holds
him
by
the
wrists
and
it
grows
cold
now
and
rigid
upon
them
it
is
as
if
they
were
fettered
with
iron





lady

dread
of
her
once
despised
kinsman
now
that
she
knew
what
a
powerful
weapon
he
held
in
his
hands
this
night
was
almost
fantastic
as
she
darted
from
the
room
she
fell
against
ren
who
with
a
white
face
and
bent
ear
stood
at
the
door
eavesdropping
ready
to
rush
to
the
help
of
sir
adrians
friend
upon
the
first
hint
of
necessity
but
he
had
heard
more
than
he
bargained
for
the
scared
wellnigh
agonised
look
of
inquiry
with
which
he
turned
to
his
mistress
was
lost
upon
her
in
her
whirlwind
exit
she
seized
upon
him
and
dragged
him
with
her
to
the
ladder
that
led
to
the
tower
quick
ren
the
signal
and
with
the
birdlike
swiftness
of
a
dream
flight
she
was
up
the
steps
before
him
panting
in
her
wake
ran
the
sturdy
fellow
his
brain
seething
in
a
chaos
of
conflicting
thought
mr
the
captain
must
be
helped
must
be
saved
this
one
thing
was
clear
at
any
rate
his
honour
would
wish
it
sono
matter
what
had
happened
yes
he
would
obey
my
lady
and
make
the
signal
but
what
if
mr
landale
were
right
not
indeed
in
his
accusation
of
mr
the
captain
ren
knew
ren
had
seen
enough
to
trust
him
he
was
no
false
friend
but
as
regarded
my
lady
alas
my
lady
had
indeed
been
strange
in
her
manner
these
days
and
even
moggie
as
he
minded
him
now
even
moggie
had
noticed
had
hinted
and
he
had
not
understood
the
mans
fingers
fumbled
over
the
catch
of
the
great
lantern
he
shook
as
if
he
had
the
palsy
goodness
divine
if
his
master
were
to
come
home
to
this
impatiently
lady
landale
pushed
him
upon
one
side
what
ailed
the
fellow
when
every
second
was
crucial
life
or
death
bringing
medusalike
for
one
second
her
face
hung
whiteillumined
set
into
terrible
fixity
above
the
great
flame
the
next
instant
all
was
blackness
to
their
dazzled
eyes
the
light
of
scarthey
was
out
she
groped
for
ren
her
hot
fingers
burnt
upon
his
cold
rough
hand
for
a
second
i
will
go
down
to
the
sands
she
said
whispering
as
if
she
feared
even
here
the
keenness
of
ruperts
ear
and
youhurry
to
him
stop
with
him

him
your
masters

she
flitted
from
him
like
a
shadow
the
ladder
creaked
faintly
beneath
her
light
footfall
and
then
louder
beneath
his
weighty
tread
his
masters

ay
he

stand
by
him
for

for

out
upon
the
beach
ran
molly
it
was
a
mild
still
night
through
veils
of
light
mist
the
moon
shone
with
a
tranquil
bridelike
grace
upon
the
heaving
palpitating
waters
and
the
mystery
of
the
silent
land
a
very
night
for
lovers
it
seemed
for
sweet
meetings
and
sweeter
partings
a
night
that
mocked
with
its
great
passionless
calm
at
the
wild
anguish
of
this
womans
impatience
yet
a
night
upon
which
sound
travelled
far
she
bent
her
earwas
there
nothing
to
hear
yet
nothing
but
the
lap
of
the
restless
waters
were
those
men
false
she
rushed
to
and
fro
from
one
point
to
another
along
the
sands
in
a
delirium
of
impotent
desire
oh
hurry
hurry
hurry
and
as
she
turned
again
there
upon
the
waters
out
in
the
offing
glimmered
a
light
curtseying
with
the
swell
of
the
waves
the
sails
of
a
ship
caught
the
moonbeams
she
could
see
the
vessel
plainly
and
that
it
was
bearing
full
for
the
island
alas
this
might
scarcely
be
the
little
shearman
boat
manned
by
two
fishermen
only
even
she
unversed
in
sea
knowledge
could
tell
that
it
was
as
large
as
the
peregrine
itselfcertainly
as
large
as
the
cutter
the
cutter
she
caught
her
breath
and
clapped
her
hands
to
her
lips
to
choke
down
the
wild
scream
of
fear
that
rose
to
them
at
the
same
instant
a
dull
thud
of
oars
a
subdued
murmur
of
a
deep
voice
rose
from
the
other
side
of
the
island
they
were
coming
coming
from
the
landward
these
rescuers
of
her
beloved
and
yonder
with
swelling
canvas
came
the
hell
ship
from
out
the
open
sea
sent
by
ruperts
infernal
malice
and
cleverness
to
make
their
help
of
no
avail
to
seize
him
in
the
very
act
of
flight
she
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
with
all
her
strength
called
upon
the
newcomers
to
speed
herehere
for
gods
sake
hasten
or
it
will
be
too
late
her
voice
seemed
to
her
in
the
midst
of
the
endless
space
weak
as
a
childs
but
it
was
heard
coming
answered
a
gruff
shout
from
afar
and
the
oar
beat
came
closer
and
fell
with
swifter
rhythm
stumbling
catching
in
her
skirts
careless
of
pool
or
stone
beneath
her
little
slippered
feet
lady
landale
came
flying
round
the
ruins
a
couple
of
boats
crashed
in
upon
the
shingle
and
the
whole
night
seemed
suddenly
to
become
alive
with
dark
figuresmen
in
uniform
with
gleams
upon
them
of
brass
badges
and
shining
belts
and
in
their
hands
the
gleam
of
arms
for
the
moment
she
could
not
move
it
was
as
if
her
knees
were
giving
way
and
she
must
fall
none
of
them
saw
her
in
the
shadow
but
as
they
passed
she
heard
them
talking
to
each
other
about
the
signal
the
signal
which
they
had
been
told
to
look
for

been
brought
to
them

the
signal
she
had
made
then
with
a
wave
of
rage
the
power
of
life
returned
to
her
this
was
ruperts
work
but
all
was
not
lost
yet
the

but
he
saw
her
waver
and
shudder
from
him
and
wring
her
hands
my
god
what
has
happened
the
light
out
too
what
is
it
she
fastened
on
him
with
a
sudden
fierceness
the
spring
of
a
wild
cat
come
she
said
drawing
him
towards
the
peel
if
you
would
save
him
lose
not
a
second
he
hesitated
a
moment
still
she
tugged
at
him
like
one
demented
panting
her
abjurations
at
him
though
her
voice
was
failing
her
then
without
a
word
he
fell
to
running
with
her
towards
the
keep
supporting
her
as
they
went
the
great
door
had
swung
back
on
its
hinges
and
the
men
were
pressing
in
a
dark
body
into
the
dimlit
recesses
when
sir
adrian
and
his
wife
reached
the
entrance
the
sight
of
the
uniforms
only
confirmed
the
homecomer
in
his
own
forebodings
anent
the
first
act
of
the
drama
that
was
being
enacted
upon
his
peaceful
island
he
needed
no
further
pushing
from
the
frantic
woman
at
his
side
lost
in
bringing
her
back
perhaps
his
only
friend
lost
by
his
loyalty
and
his
true
friendship
they
dashed
up
the
stone
stairs
just
as
the
locked
door
of
the
livingroom
burst
with
a
crash
under
the
efforts
of
many
stalwart
shoulders
they
saw
the
men
crush
forwards
and
fall
back
and
herd
on
again
with
a
hoarse
murmur
that
leaped
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
ren
came
running
out
from
the
throng
with
the
face
of
one
that
has
seen
death
and
he
caught
his
mistress
by
the
arm
and
held
her
by
main
force
against
the
wall
he
showed
no
surprise
at
the
sight
of
his
masterthere
are
moments
in
life
that
are
beyond
surprisebut
cried
wildly
she
must
not
see
she
fought
like
a
tigress
against
the
faithful
arms
but
still
they
held
her
and
sir
adrian
went
in
alone
a
couple
of
men
were
dragging
captain
jack
to
his
feet
forcing
his
hands
from
the
dead
mans
throat
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
grown
as
rigid
and
paralysed
in
their
clasp
like
the
corpse
hands
that
had
now
likewise
to
be
wrenched
from
their
clutch
of
him
he
glanced
around
as
though
dazed
then
down
at
the
disfigured
purple
face
of
his
dead
enemy
smiled
and
held
out
his
hands
stiffly
for
the
gyves
that
were
snapped
upon
them
and
then
one
of
the
fellows
with
some
instinctive
feeling
of
decency
flung
a
coat
over
the
slain
man
and
captain
jack
threw
up
his
head
and
met
adrians
horrorstricken
sorrowful
eyes
at
the
unexpected
sight
he
grew
scarlet
he
waved
his

hustled
him

some
of
the
men
were
speaking
to
sir
adrian
but
drew
back
respectfully
before
the
spectacle
of
his
wordless
agony
but
as
molly
with
a
shriek
would
have
flung
herself
after
the

her
husband
awoke
to
action
and
pushing
ren
aside
caught
her
round
the
waist
with
an
unyielding
grip
his
eyes
sought
her
face
and
as
the
light
fell
on
it
he
understood
aye
she
had
been
brought
back
to
him

weary
brow

he
paused
and
looked
at

the
sombre
fire
of
her

at

you

that
i

she
said
with
a
terrible
composure
a
sudden
whiteness
spread
round
sir
adrians
lips
poor
child
he
said
again
beneath
his
breath
yes
i
love
him
i
always
wanted
to
see
him
i
was
sick
and
tired
of
life
at
pulwick
and
that
was
why
i
went
on
board
his
ship
i
went
deliberately
because
i
could
not
bear
the
dulness
of
it
all
he
mistook
me
for
madeleine
in
the
darkhe
kissed
me
afterwards
i
told
him
that
i
loved
him
i
begged
him
to
take
me
away
with
him
for
ever
i
love
him
still
i
would
go
with
him
stillit
is
as
well
that
you
should
know
nothing
can
alter
it
now
but
he
did
not
want
me
he
loves
madeleine
the
words
fell
from
her
lips
with
a
steady
cruel
deliberateness
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
him
as
she
spoke
unpityingly
uncaring
what
anguish
she
inflicted
nay
it
seemed
from
some
strange
perversity
glad
to
make
him
suffer
but
hard
upon
a
man
as
it
must
be
to
hear
such
a
confession
from
his
wifes
lips
doubly
hard
to
such
a
one
as
adrian
whose
heart
bled
for
her
pain
as
well
as
for
his
own
he
held
himself
without
departing
for
a
second
from
his
wonted
quiet
dignity
only
in
his
earnest
gaze
upon
her
there
was
perhaps
if
possible
an
added
tenderness
but
she
to
see
him
so
unmoved
was
moved
herself
to
a
sudden
scorn
what
manner
of
man
was
this
that
not
love
nor
jealousy
nor
anger
had
power
to
stir
and
now
what
will
you
do
with
me
she
asked
him
again
with
superb
contempt
on
eye
and
lip
for
a
guilty
wife
i
am
to
you
as
far
as
the
will
could
make
me
and
i
have
no
claim
upon
you
any
more
no
claim
upon
me
he
repeated
with
a
wonder
of
grief
in
his
voice

you

no

put
yourself
out

now
than

out

you
been

you
may

my

your

my
only
wish
to
cherish
and
shelter
you
you
cannot
escape
my
care
poor
child
and
some
day
you
may
be
glad
of
it
my
protection
my
countenance
you
will
always
have
god
who
am
i
that
i
should
judge
you
is
there
any
sin
of
human
frailty
that
a
human
being
dare
condemn
guilty
what
is
your
guilt
compared
to
mine
for
bringing
you
to
this
allying
my
melancholy
age
with
your
bright
youth
he
fell
into
the
chair
opposite
to
her
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
as
for
a
minutes
space
his
selfcontrol
wavered
she
watched
him
wearily
her
heat
of
temper
had
fallen
from
her
very
quickly
she
broke
into
a
moan
oh
what
does
it
matter
what
does
anything
matter
now
i
love
him

i

little
silence
sir
adrian
rose
i
must
leave
you
now
i
must
go
to
pulwick
he
said
his
heart
was
yearning
to
her
he
would
have
gathered
her
to
his
arms
as
a
father
his
erring
child
but
he
refrained
from
even
touching
her
and
youwhat
would
you
do
it
shall
be
as
you
like
i
would
go

she
said
the
carriage
shall
be
sent
for
you
in
the
morning
and
renny
and
his

this

beeni
will
join
you
and
together
we
shall
work
to
save
his
life
he
paused
hesitated
and
was
about
to
turn
away
when
suddenly
she
caught
his
hand
and
kissed
it
he
knew
she
would
as
readily
have
kissed
rens
hand
for
a
like
promise
that
her
gratitude
was
a
pitiable
thing
for
him
her
husband
to
bear
and
yet
all
the
way
on
his
sad
and
solitary
journey
to
pulwick
the
touch
of
her
lips
went
with
him
bringing
a
strange
sweetness
to
his
heart





there
was
a
vast
deal
of
wonder
in
the
county
generally
and
among
the
old
friends
of
his
fathers
house
in
particular
when
it
became
known
that
sir
adrian
landale
had
engaged
a
noted
counsel
to
defend
his
brothers
murderer
and
was
doing
all
he
could
to
avert
his
probable
doom
in
lowered
tones
were
whispered
strange
tales
of
lady
landales
escapade
people
wagged
wise
and
virtuous
heads
and
breathed
scandalous
hints
of
her
power
upon
her
infatuated
husband
and
then
they
would
tap
their
foreheads
significantly
indeed
it
needed
all
the
master
of
pulwicks
widespread
reputation
for
mental
unsoundness
to
enable
him
to
carry
through
such
proceedings
without
rousing
more
violent
feelings
as
it
was
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
his
interference
had
any
other
effect
than
that
of
helping
to
inflame
the
public
mind
against
the
prisoner
the
jurys
verdict
was
a
foregone
conclusion
and
though
the
learned
lawyer
duly
prepared
a
very
fine
speech
and
pocketed
some
monstrous
fees
with
a
great
deal
of
complaisance
he
was
honest
enough
not
to
hold
out
the
smallest
hope
of
being
able
to
save
his
client
the
conviction
was
too
clear
the
crimes
the
prisoner
had
committed
were
of
too
horrible
and
bloody
a
character
threatening
the
very
foundations
of
society
to
admit
of
a
merciful
view
of
the
case
as
the
trial
drew
near
sir
adrians
despondency
increased
each
day
seemed
to
bring
a
heavier
furrow
to
his
brow
an
added
weight
to
his
lagging
steps
he
avoided
as
much
as
possible
all
meetings
with
his
wife
who
on
the
contrary
recovered
stronger
courage
with
the
flight
of
time
but
whose
feverish
interest
in
his
exertions
was
now
transferred
to
some
secret
plans
that
she
was
for
ever
discussing
with
ren
the
prisoner
himself
showed
great
calmness
they
will
sentence
me
of
course
he
said
quietly
to
adrian
but
whether
they
will
hang
me
is
another
question
i
dont
think
that
my
hour
has
come
yet
or
that
the
cord
is
twisted
which
will
hang
jack
smith
in
other
moods
he
would
ridicule

labours
in
his
cause
with
the
most
gentle
note
of
affectionate
mockery
but
from
the
desire
doubtless
to
save
one
so
disinterested
and
unworldly
from
any
accusation
of
complicity
he
was
silent
upon
the
schemes
on
which
he
pinned
his
hopes
of
escape
the
first
meeting
of
the
friends
after
the
scene
at
scarthey
had
been
of
course
painful
to
both
when
he
entered
the
cell
adrian
had
stretched
out
his
hand
in
silence
but
captain
jack
held
his
own
pressed
to
his
side
it
is
like
you
to
come
he
said
gloomily
but
you
cannot
shake
the
hand
that
stifled
your
brothers
life
out
of
him
and
i
should
do
it
again
adrian
mark
you
i
am
not
repentant
give
me
your
hand
jack
said
adrian
steadfastly
i
am
not
of
those
who
shift
responsibility
from
the
dead
to
the
living
you
were
grievously
treated
oh
give
me
your
hand
friend
can
i
think
of
anything
now
but
your
peril
and
your
truth
to
me
for
an
instant
still
the
younger
man
hesitated
and
inquiringly
raised
his
eyes
laden
with
anxious
trouble
to
the
elder
mans
face
my
wife
has
told
me
all
said
sir
adrian
turning
his
head
to
hide
his
twitching
lip
and
then
jack
smiths
hand
leaped
out
to
meet
his
friends
upon
an
impulse
of
warm
sympathy
and
the
two
faced
each
other
looking
the
words
they
could
not
utter





the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
fifteen
which
delivered
england
at
last
from
the
strain
of
outlandish
conflict
saw
a
revival
of
official
activity
concerning
matters
of
more
homely
interest
the
powers
that
were
awoke
to
the
necessity
among
other
things
of
putting
a
stop
by
the
most
stringent
means
to
the
constant
and
extensive
leakage
in
the
national
revenue
proceeding
from
the
organisation
of
free
traders
or
smugglers
after
twenty
years
of
almost
complete
supineness
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
the
first
efforts
made
towards
a
systematic
preventive
coast
service
composed
of
customs
excise
and
naval
officials
in
proportion
varied
according
to
the
localities
remained
singularly
futile
and
to
the
notorious
inability
of
these
latter
to
cope
with
the
experience
and
the
devilish
daring
of
the
old
established
free
traders
was
due
no
doubt
to
the
ferocity
of
the
inquisitional
laws
presently
levelled
against
smuggling
and
smugglerslaws
which
ruthlessly
trenched
upon
almost
every
element
of
the
british
subjects
vaunted
personal
freedom
and
which
added
for
the
time
several
new
hanging
cases
to
the
sixty
odd
already
in
existence
that
part
of
the
indictment
against
captain
jack
smith
and
the
other
criminals
still
at
large
which
dealt
with
their
offences
against
the
smuggling
act
would
in
later
times
have
broken
down
infallibly
from
want
of
proper
evidence
not
a
tittle
of
information
was
forthcoming
which
could
support
examination
but
a
judge
of
assizes
and
a
jury
in
1815
were
not
to
be
baulked
of
the
necessary
victim
by
mere
circumstantiality
when
certain
offences
against
society
and
against
his
majesty
had
to
be
avenged
and
the
dispensers
of
justice
were
less
concerned
with
strict
evidence
than
with
the
desirability
of
making
examples
strong
presumption
was
all
that
was
required
to
them
to
hang
their
man
and
indeed
the
hanging
of
captain
jack
upon
the
other
and
more
serious
counts
than
that
of
unlawful
occupation
was
as
has
been
said
a
foregone
conclusion
the
triple
charge
of
murder
being
but
too
fully
corroborated
every
specious
argument
that
could
be
mooted
was
of
course
put
forward
by
counsel
for
the
defence
to
show
that
the
death
of
the
preventive
men
and
of
mr
landale
on
scarthey
island
and
the
sinking
of
the
revenue
cutter
must
be
looked
upon
on
the
one
hand
as
simple
manslaughter
in
selfdefence
and
as
the
result
of
accidental
collision
on
the
other
but
as
every
one
anticipated
the
charge
of
the
judge
and
the
finding
of
the
jury
demanded
strenuously
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
besides
this
the
judge
deemed
it
advisable
to
introduce
into
the
sentence
one
of
those
already
obsolete
penalties
of
posthumous
degradation
devised
in
coarser
ages
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
awful

it
was
in

there
also
old
stories
of
his

tenets

of
his
wellknown
disaffection

the
established
order
of

up

an

interest
in
the

in
memory
of
an
old
friendship
with
his
father
informed
the
baronet
that
his
persistence
was
viewed
with
extreme
disfavour
in
the
most
exalted
quarter
and
that
his
royal
highness
himself
had
pronounced
that
captain

was
a
damned
rascal
and
richly
deserved
his
fate
from
the

no
stone
unturned
no
possibility
untried
in
the
effort
to
save
his
friend
wellnigh
the
saddest
part
of
the
whole
business
to
him
was
the
realisation
that
the
prisoner
had
not
only
broken
those
custom
laws
of
which
sir
adrian
himself
disapproved
as
arbitrary

also
as
he
had
been
warned

other
laws
upon
which
depend

grievously

given

at

the
sentence
could
not
be
pronounced
otherwise
than
just
and
so
with
an
aching
heart
and
a
wider
horror
than
ever
of
the
cruel
world
of
men
and
of
the
injustices
to
which
legal
justice

that

muster

time

now
drawing
short
as
the
traveller
rattled
along
the
stony
streets
of
the
old
palatine
town
and
saw
the
dawn
breaking
exquisite
primrose
tinted
faintly
beautiful
as
some
dream
vision
over
the
distant
hills
his
soul

gripped
with
an
iron
clutch
in
three
more
days
the
gallant
heart
breaking
in
the
confinement
of
the
prison
yonder
would
have
throbbed
its
last
and
he
longed
with
a
desire
futile
but
none
the
less
intense
that
according
to
that
doctrine
of
vicarious
atonement
preached
to
humanity
by
the
greatest
of
all
examples
he
could
lay
down
his
own
weary
and
disappointed
life
for
his
friend
having
breakfasted
at
the
hotel
less
for
the
necessity
of
food

for
the
sake
of
passing
the
time
till
the
morning
should
have
worn
to
sufficient
maturity
he
sought
on

the
quiet
lodgings

he

after
all
she
loves
the
poor

all
her
heart

i

she

to
the
roots

his

whilst
he
shifted
nervously
from
one
foot
to
another
that
my
lady
has
been
much
upset
about
the
poor
captain

his
honour

she
would
sit
staring
out
of
the
window
there
just
where
the
street
turns
up
to
the
castle
and
neither
ate
nor
slept
nor
talked
to
speak
of
of
course
as
i
told
the
old
demoiselle
i
knew
it
was
because
my
lady
had
taken
it
to
heart
about
the
signal
that
she
madethinking
to
save
himand
which
only
brought
the
gabelous
on
him
that
his
honours
infernal
brother
god
forgive
me

have
mercy
on
his
soul
had
set
to

and
my

liked
to
see
me
coming
and
going
for
she
sent
me
every
day
to
the
prison
she
did
not
once
go
herself
sir
adrian
drew
a
long
breath
with
the
most
delicate
intuition
of
his
masters
thoughts
ren
avoided
even
a
glance
at
him
while
he
continued
in
as
natural
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
but
the
day
after
the
old
miss
came
she
my
lady
told
me
to
find
out
if
he
would
see
her
he
said
no
but
that
the
only
kindness
any
one
could
do
him
now
would
be
to
bring
him
mademoiselle
madeleine
and
let
him
speak
to
her
once
more
and
my
lady
when
she
heard
this
she
started
off
that
day
with
the
old
one
to
fetch
mademoiselle
herself
at
pulwick
and
she
left
me
behind
your
honour
for
i
had
a
little
plan
there
ren
faltered
and
a
crestfallen
look
crept
upon
his
face
sir
adrian
remembered
how
before
his
departure
for
london
his
servant
had
cheerily
assured
him
that
mr
the
captain
would
be
safe
out
of
the
country
long
before
he
returned
faith
of
him
ren
who
had
already
been
in
two
prisons
and
knew
their
ways
and
how
to
contrive
an
escape
as
his
honour
well
knew
a
sad
smile
parted
his
lips
and
so
you
failed
renny
he
said
ah
your
honour
those
satanic
english
turnkeys
with
a
frenchman
the
job
had
been
done
but
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
be
in

in
england
his
honour
can
vouch
i
have
some
brains
i
had

hundred
plans
but
there
was
ever
something
that
did
not
work
the
captain
he
too
was
eager
as
your
honour
can
imagine
my
faith
we
thought
and
we
thought
and
we
schemed
and
contrived
and
in
the
end
there
was
only
one
thing
to
complete
our
plotto
bribe
the
jailer
would
your
honour
believeit
was
only
that
one
little
difficulty
my
lady
had
given
me
a
hundred
guineas
i
had
enough
money
your
honour
sees
but
the
mani
had
smoked
with
him
drunk
with
him
ay
and
made
him
drunk
too
and
i
thought
all
was
going
well
but
when
i
hinted
to
him
what
we
wantedah
he
was
a
brutei
tell
you
i
had
hard
work
to
escape
the
prison
myself
and
only
for
my
leaving
him
with
some
of
the
money
i
should
now
be
pinched
there
too
i
hardly
dare
show
my
face
in
the
place
any
more
and
my
poor
lady
builds
on
the
hope
and
mr
the
captaini
had
to
tell
him
he
took
it
like
an
angel
ah
the
poor
gentleman
he
looked
at
me
so
brave
and
kind
i
am
as
grateful
my
poor
friend
as
if
you
had
done
it
said
he
and
perhaps
it
is
all
for
the
best
all
for
the
bestah
your
honour
ren
fairly
broke
down
here
and
wept
on
his
sleeve
but
sir
adrians
eyes
circled
and
worn
with
watching
and
thought
shone
dry
with
a
far
deeper
grief
as
a
few
moments
later
he
passed
along
the
street
towards
the
walls
of
the
castle





there
was
in
those
days
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
admission
to
a
condemned
prisoner
and
in
the
rear
of
the
redheaded
goodtempered
looking
jailerthe
same
he
surmised
whose
sternness
in
duty
had
baffled
the
bretons
simple
wileshe
stepped
out
of
the
sweet
morning
sunshine
into
the
long
stone
passages
the
first
tainted
breath
of
the
prison
brought
a
chill
to
his
blood
and
oppression
to
his
lungs
and
the
gloom
of
the
place
enveloped
him
like
a
pall
with
a
rattle
of
keys
a
door
dismally
creaking
on
its
hinges
was
swung
back
at
last
and
the
visitor
was
ushered
into
the
narrow
cell
dark
for
all
its
whitewashed
walls
where
captain
jack
was
spending
his
last
hours
upon
earth
the
hinges
groaned
again
the
door
slammed
and
the
key
once
more
grated
in
the
lock
sir
adrian
was
alone
with
his
friend
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
the
contraction
of
the
elder
mans
heart
had
brought
a
giddiness
to
his
brain
a
dimness
of
his
eyes
through
which
he
was
ill
able
to
distinguish
anything
but
then
there
was
a
clank
of
fettersah
what
a
sound
to
connect
with
lucky
jack
smith
the
gayest
freest
and
most
buoyant
of
men
and
a
voice
cried
adrian
it
had
a
joyful
ring
wellnigh
the
old
hearty
tones
it
struck
adrian
to
the
soul
he
could
have
borne
he
thought
to
find
his
friend
a
broken
man
changed
out
of
all
recognition
crushed
by
his
misfortunes
but
to
find
him
the
same
a
little
pale
indeed
and
thinner
with
a
steady
earnestness
in
the
seablue
eyes
instead
of
the
old
dancinglight
but
still
gallant
and
undaunted
still
radiating
vigorous
life
and
breezy
energy
by
his
very
presence
this
was
a
cruelty
of
fate
which
seemed
unendurable
i
declare
the
prisoner
had
continued
i
declare
i
thought
you
were
only
the
incorruptible
jailer
taking
his
morning
survey
they
are
desperately
careful
of
me
adrian
and
watch
me
with
maternal
solicitude
lest
i
should
strangle
myself
with
my
chains
these
pretty
bracelets
which
i
have
had
to
wear
ever
since
poor
renny
was
found
out
or
swallow

pillowdash

why
adrian
old
friend
there
was
a
sudden
change
of
tone
to
the
warmest
concern
for
sir
adrian
had
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
jack
as
nimbly
as
his
fetters
would
allow
him
sprung
to
support
him
and
conduct
him
to
the
bed
a
shaft
of
light
struck
through
the
tiny
barred
window
on
to
the
elder
mans
face
and
showed
it
against
the
surrounding
darkness
deathly
white
and
wet
with
anguish
i
have
done
all
i
could
hubert
he
murmured
in
an
extinguished
voice
but
to
no
avail
ay
man
i
guessed
as
much
but
never
fret
for
me
adrian
i
have
looked
death
too
often
in
the
face
to
play
the
poltroon
now
i
dont
say
its
the
end
i
should
have
chosen
for
myself
but
it
is
inevitable
and
there
is
nothing
as
you
know
my
friend
that
a
man
cannot
face
if
he
knows
it
must
be
faced
the
grasp
of
his
strong
warm
hands
all
manacled
as
they
were
upon
the
others
nerveless
clammy
fingers
sent
more
than
the
words
something
of
the
speakers
own
courage
to
his
friends
wrung
heart
and
yet
that
very
courage
was
an
added
torment
that
from
a
community
so
full
of
evil
feeble
harmful
wretches
this
noble
soul
no
matter
how
it
had
sinned
should
be
banished
at
the
bidding
of
justicewhat
mockery
of
right
was
this
the
world
was
out
of
joint
indeed
he
groaned
aloud
nay
ill
have
none
of
it
cried
jack
our
last
talk
adrian
must
not
be
spoiled
by
futile
regrets
yes
our
last
talk
it
is
to
be
forthe
prisoners
face
became
transfigured
with
a
tenderness
so
exquisite
that
adrian
stared
at
its
beauty
amazedi
have
begged
her
madeleine
to
come
and
see
me
once
more
i
think
she
can
be
here
today
at
latest
tomorrow
and
after
that
i
would
not
see
any
of
those
i
love
again
that
i
may
fit
myself
to
meet
my
god
he
spoke
with
the
utmost
simplicity
adrian
bowed
his
head
silently
then
averting
his
eyes
he
said
my
wife
has
gone
to
pulwick
to
fetch
her
captain
jack
crimsoned
that
is
kind
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
and
after
a
pause
pursued
i
hope
you
do
not
think
it
wrong
of
me
to
wish
to
see
her
but
you
may
trust
me
i
shall
distress
her
as
little
as
is
possible
in
the
circumstances
it
is
not
as
you
can
fancyhis
face
flushed
again
as
he
spoketo
indulge
in
a
pathetic
parting
scene
or
beg
from
her
sweet
lips
one
last
kissthat
would
be
too
grossly
selfish
and
however
this
poor
body
of
mine
so
soon
to
be
carrion
may
yearn
to
hold
her
once
more
closely
these
lips
so
soon
to
touch
death
shall
touch
hers
no
more
i
have
risen
so
far
above
this
earthliness
that
in
so
many
hours
i
am
to
shake
off
for
ever
that
i
can
trust
myself
to
meet
her
soul
to
soul
she
must
believe
me
now
and
i
would
tell
her
adrian
that
my
deceit
was
not
premeditated
and
that
the
man
she
once
honoured
with
her
love
is
not
the
base
wretch
she
deems
i
think
it
may
comfort
her
if
she
does
mourn
for
me
at
allshe
has
so
proud
a
spirit
my
princess
as
i
used
to
call
herit
may
comfort
her
to
know
that
i
was
not
all
unworthy
of
the
love
she
once
gave
me
of
the
tears
she
may
yet
give
to
its
memory
and
mine
sir
adrian
pressed
his
hand
but
again
could
not
speak
and
captain
jack
went
on
you
will
give
her
a
happy
home
will
you
not
till
she
has
one
of
her
own
you
and
your
old
dragon
of
an
aunt
whose
bark
is
so
much
worse
than
her
bite
will
watch
and
guard
her
ah
poor
old
lady
she
is
one
of
those
that
will
not
weep
for
jack
smith
eh
adrian
well
well
i
have
had
a
happy
life
barring
one
or
two
hard
raps
of
fate
and
when
only
i
have
seen
madeleine
once
more
ill
feel
all
taut
for
the
port
though
the
passage
there
be
a
rough
one
sir
adrian
turned
his
gaze
with
astonishment
upon
him
the
sailor
read
his
thoughts
dont
think
he
said
while
a
sudden
shadow
crossed
his
face
dont
think
that
i
dont
realise
my
position
that
i
have
not
had
to
fight
my
battle
in
the
beginning
i
had
hopes
never
in
the
success
of
your
mission
but
absurd
as
it
was
in
rennys
scheme
the
good
fellows
own
hopefulness
was
infectious
i
believe
and
when
that
fell
throughwell
then
man
i
just
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
what
was
to
be
it
was
a
battle
as
i
told
you
i
have
been
in
danger
of
death
many
a
time
upon
the
brave
old
st
nicholas
and
my
cormorantdeath
from
the
salt
sea
from
musket
ball
and
cannon
shot
fearful
deaths
of
mangling
and
hacking
but
death
on
the
gallows
the
shameful
death
of
the
criminal
to
be
hung
to
be
executedpah
ay
it
was
a
battletwo
nights
and
one
day
i
fought
it
and
i
tell
you
tis
a
hard
thing
to
bring
the
living
flesh
and
the
leaping
blood
to
submit
to
such
as
that
at
first
i
thought
indeed
it
could
not
be
borne
and
i
must
reckon
upon
your
or
rennys
friendship
for
a
secret
speed
i
should
have
had
the
pluck
to
starve
myself
if
need
be
only
i
am
so
damned
strong
and
healthy
i
feared
it
could
not
have
been
managed
in
the
time
at
any
rate
i
could
have
dashed
my
brains
out
against
the
wallbut
i
see
it
otherwise
now
the
prison
chaplain
a
good
man
adrian
has
made
me
realise
that
it
would
be
cowardly
that
i
should
accept
my
sentence
as
atonement
as
deservedi
have
deserved
to
die
it
had
been
sir
adrians
own
thought
but
he
broke
out
now
in
inarticulate
protest
it
seemed
too
gross
too
monstrous
yes
adrian
i
have
you
warned
me
good
friend
in
your
peaceful
roomah
how
long
ago
it
seems
now
that
night
when
all
that
could
make
life
beautiful
lay
to
my
hand
for
the
taking
oh
man
why
did
i
not
heed
you
you
warned
me
he
who
breaks
one
law
will
end
by
breaking
many
you
were
right
see
the
harm
i
wreakedthose
poor
fellows
who
were
but
doing
their
duty
bravely
whose
lives
i
sacrificed
without
remorse
your
brother
too
whose
soul
with
the
most
deliberate
vindictiveness
i
sent
before
its
maker
without
an
instants
preparation
a
guilty
soul
it
was
for
he
hounded
me
down
one
would
almost
think
for
the
sport
of
it
god
when
i
think
that
but
for
him
for
his
wanton
interferencebut
there
the
devils
are
loose
again
i
must
not
think
on
him
do
i
not
deserve
my
fate
if
the
bible
law
be
right
he
who
sheds
blood
his
blood
shall
be
shed
never
was
sentence
more
just
i
have
sinned
i
have
repented
i
am
now
ready
to
atone
i
believe
the
sacrifice
will
be
accepted
he
laid
his
hand
for
a
minute
upon
the
bible
on
the
table
with
a
significant
gesture
but
sir
adrian
the
philosopher
though
he
could
find
no
words
to
impeach
the
logic
of
his
friends
reasoning
and
was
all
astir
with
admiration
for
a
resignation
as
perfect
as
either
christian
or
stoic
could
desire
found
his
soul
rising
in
tumultuous
rebellion
against
the
hideous
decree
the
longing
that
had
beset
him
in
the
dawn
now
seized
upon
him
with
a
new
passion
and
the
cry
escaped
his
lips
almost
unwittingly
oh
if
i
could
die
for
you
no
no
said
jack
with
his
sweet
smile
your
life
is
too
valuable
too
precious
to
the
world
adrian
believe
me
you
can
still
do
much
good
with
it
and
i
know
you
will
be
happy
yet
it
was
the
only
allusion
he
had
made
to
his
friends
more
personal
sorrows
before
the
latter
had
time
to
reply
he
hastened
to
proceed
and
now
to
business
all
the
gold
entrusted
to
me
lies
at
scarthey
and
faith
i
believe
it
lies
as
weightily
on
my
mind
as
if
it
was
all

renny
knows
the
secret
hidingplace
will
you
engage
to
restore
it
to
its
owners
in
all
privacy
this
is
a
terribly
arduous
undertaking
adrian
and
it
is
asking
much
of
your
friendship
but
if
i
know
you
not
too
much
and
it
will
enable
my
poor
bones
to
lie
at
rest
or
rather
with
a
rueful
laugh
hang
at
rest
on
their
gibbet
for
you
know
i
am
to
be
set
up
as
a
warning
to
other
fools
like
a
rat
on
a
barn
door
i
have
by
the
kindness
of
the
chaplain
been
able
to
write
out
a
full
schedule
of
the
different
sums
and
to
whom
they
are
due
he
has
taken
charge
of
the
closed
packet
directed
to
you
and
will
give
it
to
you
intact
i
feel
sure
he
is
a
man
of
honour
and
i
trust
him
to
respect
the
confidence
i
have
placed
in
him
egad
the
poor
old
boys
will
be
right
glad
to
get
their
coin
back
in
safety
a
couple
of
them
have
been
up
here
already
to
interview
me
in
fear
and
trembling
they
were
hard
set
to
credit
me
when
i
assured
them
that
they
would
be
no
losers
in
the
end
after
allbarring
the
waiting
you
see
i
counted
upon
you
i
shall
never
rest
until
it
is
done
said
sir
adrian
simply
and
captain
jack
as
simply
answered
thank
you
among
the
treasure
there
is
also
10000
of
my
own
the
rest
of
my
laboriously
acquired
fortune
is
forfeit
to
the
crown
as
you
knowmuch
good
may
it
do
it
but
this
little
hoard
i
give
to
you
you
do
not
want
it
of
course
and
therefore
it
is
only
to
be
yours
that
you
may
administrate
it
in
accordance
to
my
wishes
another
chargebut
i
make
no
apology
i
wish
you
to
divide
it
in
three
equal
shares
two
to
be
employed
as
you
see
best
for
the
widows
and
families
of
those
poor
fellows
of
the
preventive
service
victims
of
my
venture
the
third
as
well
as
my
beautiful
peregrine
i
leave
to
the
mate
and
men
who
served
me
so
faithfully
they
have
fled
with
her
and
must
avoid
england
for
some
time
but
renny
will
contrive
to
hear
of
them
they
are
bound
to
return
in
secret
for
tidings
and
i
should
like
to
feel
that
the
misery
i
have
left
behind
me
may
be
mitigated
and
now
dear
adrian
that
is
all
the
man

grows
impatient
i
hear
him
shuffling
his

adrian
seized
his
friend
by
the
hands
with
a
despairing
grip
the
door
rolled
back
with
its
dismal
screech
the
prisoner
smiled
at
him
with
tender
eyes
this
man
whom
all
unwillingly
he
had
robbed
of
his
wifes
heart
was
broken
with
grief
that
he
could
not
save
the
life
that
had
brought
him
misery
here
was
a
friend
to
be
proud
of
even
at
the
gate
of
death
god
be

my

words
from
my
death
will
be
born
your
happiness
and
if
its
growth
be
slow
yet
it
will
wax
strong
and
sure
as
the
years
go
by
the
words
broke
from
him
with
prophetic
solemnity
their
hands
fell
apart
and
adrian
led
by
the
jailer
stumbled
forth
blindly
jack
smith
stood
erect
still
smiling
watching
them
were
adrian
to
turn
he
should
find
no
weakness
no
faltering
for
the
final
remembrance
but
adrian
did
not
turn
and
the
door
closed
closed
upon
hope
and
happiness
and
life
shut
in
shame
and
death
out
yonder
with
adrian
was
the
fresh
bright
world
the

sunshine
the

here
the
prison
smells
the
gloom
the
constraint
the
inflicted
dreadful
death
all
his
hardwon
calm
fled
from
him
all
his
youth
his
immense
vitality
woke
up
and
cried
out
in
him
again
he
raised
his
hands
and
pulled
fiercely
at
his
collar
as
if
already
the
rope
were
round
his
neck
strangling
him
his
blood
hammered
in
his
brain

the

threw
up

then
fell
upon

by
sobs

from
the
beautiful
young
brood
that
was
to

sprung
from
his
loins
would
have
grafted
on
the
old
stock

fresh
and
noble
tree

the
one
he
loved
and
the
one
who
loved
him
on
the
evening
of
the
previous
day
lady
landale
and
her
aunt
had
arrived
at
pulwick
the
drive
had
been
a
dismal
one
to
poor
miss
odonoghue
neither
her
angry
expostulations
nor
her
tender
remonstrances
nor
her
attempts
at
consolation
could
succeed
in
drawing
a
connected
sentence
from
molly
who
with
a
fever
spot
of
red
upon
each
cheek
only
roused
herself
from
the
depth
of
thought
in
which
she
seemed
plunged
to
urge
the
coachman
to
greater
speed
miss
odonoghue
tried
the
whole
gamut
of
her
art
in
vain
and
was
obliged
at
last
to
desist
from
sheer
weariness
and
in
much
anxiety
madeleine
and
sophia
were
seated
by
the
fireside
in
the
library
when
the
unexpected
travellers
came
in
upon
them
sophia
in
the
blackest
of
black
weeds
started
guiltily
up
from
the
volume
of
the
corsair
in
which
she
had
been
plunged
while
madeleine
without
manifesting
any
surprise
rose
placidly
laid
aside
her
needleworka
coarse
flannel
frock
evidently
destined
for
charityand
bestowed
upon
her
sister
and
aunt
an
affectionate
though
unexpansive
embrace
she
had
grown
somewhat
thinner
and
more
thoughtfullooking
since
molly
and
she
had
last
met
on
that
fatal
15th
of
march
but
otherwise
was
unchanged
in
her
serene
beauty
molly
clutched
her
wrist
with
a
burning
hand
and
paying
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
other
two
nor
condescending
to
any
preamble
began
at
once
in
hurried
words
to
explain
her
mission
he
has
asked
for
you
madeleine
she
cried
her
eyes
flaming
with
unnatural
brilliance
as
they
sought
her
sisters
mild
gaze
he
has
asked
for
you
i
will
take
you
back
with
me
tomorrow
not
later
than
tomorrow
dont
you
understand
shaking
her
impatiently
as
she
held
her
he
is
in
prison
condemned
to
death
he
has
asked
for
you
he
wants
to
see
you
on
saturdayon
saturday
something
clicked
in
her
throat
and
she
raised
her
hand
to
it
with
an
uneasy
gesture
one
that
those
who
surrounded
her
had
grown
curiously
familiar
with
of
late
madeleine
drew
away
from
her
at
this
address
the
whole
fair
calm
of
her
countenance
troubled
like
a
placid
pool
by
the
casting
of
a
stone
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
down
i
saw
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
condemned
she
said
i
have
prayed
for
him
daily
i
trust
he
repents
i
am
truly
sorry
for
him
from
my
heart
i
forgive
him
the
deception
he
practised
upon
me
but
a
slight
shudder
shook
her
i
could
not
see
him
againsurely
you
could
not
wish
it
of
me
she
spoke
with
such
extreme
gentleness
that
for
a
minute
the
woman
before
her
in
the
seething
turmoil
of
her
soul
failed
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
her
words
you
could
not
go
she
repeated
in
a
bewildered
way
i
could
not
wish
it
of
you
then
with
a
sort
of
shriek
which
drew
tanty
and
miss
sophia
hurriedly
towards
her
dont
you
understandon
saturdayif
it
all
fails
they
will
hang
him
aah
exclaimed
madeleine
with
a
movement
as
if
to
ward
off
the
soundthe
cry
the
gesture
expressive
not
of
grief
but
of
shrinking
repugnance
but
after
a
second
controlling
herself
and
what
should
that
be
now
sister
to
you
or
to
me
she
said
haughtily
lady
landale
clapped
her
hands
together
and
this
is
the
woman
he
loves
she
cried
with
a
shrill
laugh
and
she
staggered
and
sank
back
upon
a
chair
in
an
attitude
of
utter
prostration
molly
molly
exclaimed
her
sister
reprovingly
while
she
glanced
in
much
distress
at
miss
odonoghue
you
are
not
yourself
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
remember
interposed
sophia
in
tragic
tones
that
you
are
speaking
of
the
murderer
of
my
beloved
brother
then
she
dissolved
in
tears
and
was
obliged
to
hide
her
countenance
in
the
folds
of
a
vast
pockethandkerchief
killing
vermin
is
not
murder
cried
molly
fiercely
awakening
from
her
torpor
miss
odonoghue
who
in
the
most
unwonted
silence
had
been
watching
the
scene
with
her
shrewd
eyes
here
seized
the
horrified
sophia
by
the
elbow
and
trundled
her
with
a
great
deal
of
energy
and
determination
to
the
door
get
out
of
this
you
foolish
creature
she
said
in
a
stern
whisper
and
dont
attempt
to
show
your
nose
here
again
till
i
give
it
leave
to
walk
in
then
returning
to
the
sisters
and
looking
from
mollys
haggard
distracted
face
to
madeleines
pale
one
if
you
take
my
advice
my
dear
she
said
a
little
drily
to
the
latter
you
will
not
make
so
many
bones
about
going
to
see
that
poor
lad
in
the
prison
and
youll
stop
wrangling
with
your
sister
for
she
is
just
not
able
to
bear
it
we
shall
start
tomorrow
molly
turning
to
lady
landale
and
speaking
in
the
tone
of
one
addressing
a
sick
child
and
madeleine
will
be
quite
ready
as
early
as
you
wish
my
dear
aunt
said
madeleine
growing
white
to
the
lips
i
am
very
sorry
if
molly
is
ill
but
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
think
i
can
yield
to
her
wishes
in
this
matter
i
could
not
go
i
could
not
it
is
impossible
hear
her
cried
the
other
starting
from
her
seat
oh
what
are
you
made
of
is
it
water
that
runs
in
your
veins
you
that
he
lovesher
voice
broke
into
a
wailyou
who
ought
to
be
so
proud
to
know
he
loves
you
even
though
your
heart
be
broken
you
refuse
to
go
to
him
refuse
his
last
request
come
to
the
light
she
went
on
seizing
the
girls
wrists
again
let
me
look
at
you
bah
you
never
loved
him
you
dont
even
understand
what
it
is
to
love
but
what
could
one
expect
from
you
who
abandoned
him
in
the
moment
of
danger
you
are
afraid
afraid
of
the
painful
scene
the
discomfort
the
sight
of
the
prison
of
his
beautiful
face
worn
and
changedafraid
of
the
discredit
oh
i
know
you
i
know
you
but
mind
you
madeleine
de
savenaye
he
wishes
to
see
you
and
i
swore
you
would
go
to
him
and
you
shall
go
if
i
have
to
drag
you
with
these
hands
of
mine
her
grip
was
so
fierce
her
eyes
so
savage
the
words
so
strange
that
madeleine
screamed
faintly
she
is
mad
and
was
amazed
that
miss
odonoghue
did
not
rush
to
the
rescue
but
miss
odonoghue
peering
at
her
from
the
depths
of
her
armchair
merely
said
snappishly
ah
child
cant
you
say
you
will
go
and
have
done
oughtnt
you
to
be
ashamed
to
be
so
hardhearted
and
mopped
her
perspiring
and
agitated
countenance
with
her
kerchief
then
upon
the
girls
bewildered
mind
dawned
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
and
blushing
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
she
looked
at
her
sister
with
a
growing
horror
oh
molly
molly
she
said
again
with
a
sort
of
groan
will
you
go
cried
molly
from
between
her
set
teeth
again
the
girl
shuddered
less
than
evernow
she
murmured
and
as
molly
threw
her
from
her
almost
with
violence
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
fell
weeping
bitter
tears
upon
the
couch
behind
her
lady
landale
with
great
steps
stormed
up
and
down
the
room
her
eyes
fixed
on
space
her
lips
moving
now
and
again
a
word
escaped
her
then
sometimes
hurled
at
her
sister
sometimes
only
in
desperate
communing
with
herself
base
cowardly
mean
oh
my
god
cruelcruel
to
go
back
without
her
after
a
little
with
a
sudden
change
of
mood
she
halted
and
stood
a
while
as
if
in
deep
reflection
holding
her
hand
to
her
head
then
crossing
the
room
hurriedly
she
knelt
down
and
flung
her
arms
round
the
weeping
figure
ma
petite
madeleine
she
said
in
a
voice
of
the
most
piteous
pleading
thou
and
i
we
were
always
good
friends
thou
canst
not
have
the
heart
to
be
so
cruel
to
me
now
see
my
darling
he
must
die
they
sayoh
madeleine
madeleine
and
he
asked
for
you
the
one
thing
he
told
ren
the
only
thing
we
could
do
for
him
on
earth
was
to
let
him
see
you
once
more
my
little
sister
you
cannot
refuse
he
loves
you
what
has
he
done
to
offend
you
your
pride
cannot
forgive
him
for
being
what
he
is
i
suppose
yet
such
as
he
is
you
should
be
proud
of
him
he
is
too
noble
too
straightforward
to
have
intentionally
deceived
you
if
he
did
wrong
it
was
for
love
of
you
madeleine
madeleine
her
tones
trailed
away
into
a
moan
miss
odonoghue
sobbed
loudly
from
her
corner
madeleine
who
had
looked
at
her
sister
at
first
with
repulsion
seemed
moved
she
placed
her
hands
upon
her
shoulders
and
gazed
sadly
into
the
flushed
face
my
poor
molly
she
said
hesitatingly
this
is
dreadful
but
i
tooi
too
was
led
into
deceit
into
folly
she
blushed
painfully
i
would
not
blame
you
it
was
not
your
fault
that
you
were
carried
away
in
his
ship
you
went
only
for
my
sake
i
cannot
forget
that
yet
that
he
should
have
this
unhappy
power
over
you
too
you
with
your
good
husband
you
a
married
woman
oh
my
poor
sister
it
is
terrible
he
is
a
wicked
man
i
pray
that
he
may
yet
repent
heavens
interrupted
molly
her
passion
up
in
arms
again
loosening
as
she
spoke
her
clasp
upon
her
sister
and
rising
to
her
feet
to
look
down
on
her
with
withering
scorn
have
i
not
made
myself
clear
are
you
deaf
stupid
as
well
as
heartless
it
is
youyouyou
he
loves
you
he
wants
what
am
i
to
him
with
a
curious
sob
half
of
laughter
half
of
anguish
your
pious
fears
are
quite
unfounded
as
far
as
he
is
concernedthe
wicked
man
as
you
call
him
oh
he
spurns
my
love
with
as
much
horror
as
even
you
could
wish

as
you
evidently
for
adrian
pities
me
he
is
doing
all
he
can
though
they
say
it
is
in

get
a
reprieve
for

i
do
love
him
while
youyou
are
too
good
too
immaculate
even
to
soil
your
dainty
foot
upon
the
floor
of
his
prison
that
floor
that
i
could
kiss
because
his
shoe
has
trod
it
but
it
is
impossible
no
human
being
could
be
so
hard
least
of
all
you
whom
i
have
seen
turn
sick
at
the
sight
of
a
dead
wormmadeleine
crouching
down
in
the
former
imploring
manner
while
her
breast
heaved
with
dry
tearless
sobs
it
cannot
hurt
you
you
who
loved
him
and
then
with
the
old
pitiful
cry
it
is
the
only
thing
he
wants
and
he
loves
you
madeleine
disengaged
herself
from
the
clinging
hands
with
a
gesture
almost
of
disgust
listen
to
me
she
said
after
a
pause
try
and
compose
yourself
and
understand
all
this
month
i
have
had
time
to
think
to
realise
to
pray
i
have
seen
what
the
world
is
worth
that
it
is
full
of
horror
of
sin
of
trouble
of
dreadful
dissensionsthat
its
sorrow
far
outweighs
its
happiness
i
have
suffered
her
pretty
lips
quivered
an
instant
but
she
hardened
herself
and
went
on
but
it
is
better
soit
was
gods
will
it
was
to
show
me
where
to
find
real
comfort
the
true
peace
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
i
was
only
waiting
to
see
you
again
and
tell
younext
week
i
am
going
back
to
the
convent
for
ever
oh
why
did
we
leave
it
molly
why
did
we
leave
it
she
broke
down
and
the
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
lady
landale
had
listened
in
silence
wellis
that
all
she
said
impatiently
when
her
sister
ceased
speaking
while
in
the
background
tanty
groaned
out
a
protest
and
bewailed
that
she
was
alive
to
see
the
day
what
does
it
matter
what
you
do
afterwardsyou
can
go
to
the
conventgo
where
you
will
then
but
what
has
that
to
say
to
your
visit
to
him
now
i
have
done
with
all
human
love
said
madeleine
solemnly
crossing
her
hands
on
her
breast
and
looking
upward
with
inspired
eyes
i
did
love
this
man
once
she
answered
hardening
herself
to
speak
firmly
though
again
her
lips
quiveredhe
himself
killed
that
love
by
his
own
doing
i
trusted
him
he
betrayed
that
trust
he
would
have
betrayed
me
but
that
i
have
forgiven
it
is
past
and
done
with
but
to
go
and
see
him
now
to
stir
up
in
my
heart
not
the
old
love
it
could
not
be
but
agitation
sorrowto
disturb
this
quietness
of
soul
this
calm
which
god
has
given
me
at
last
after
so
much
prayer
and
struggleno
noit
would
not
be
right
it
cannot
be
moreover
if
i
would
i
could
not
indeed
i
could
not
the
very
thought
of
it
all
the
disgrace
that
place
of
sin
and
shame
of
him
in
chains
condemneda
criminala
murderer
a
nervous
shudder
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
she
seemed
in
truth
to
sicken
and
grow
faint
like
one
forced
to
face
some
hideous
nauseating
spectacle
as
for
him
she
went
on
in
low
feeble
tones
it
will
be
the
best
too
god
knows
i
forgive
him
that
i
am
sorry
for
him
that
i
regret
his
terrible
fate
but
i
feel
it
would
be
worse
for
him
to
see
meif
he
must
die
it
would
be
wrong
to
distract
him
from
his
last
preparations
and
it
would
only
be
a
useless
pain
to
him
for
i
could
not
pretendhe
would
see
that
i
despise
him
i
thought
i
loved
a
noble
gentleman
not
one
who
was
even
then
playing
with
crime
and
cheating
the
faint
passionless
voice
had
hardly
ceased
before
with
a
loud
cry
molly
sprang
at
her
sister
as
if
she
would
have
strangled
her
oh
unnatural
wretch
she
exclaimed
you
are
not
fit
to
live
tanty
rushed
forward
and
dragged
the
infuriated
woman
away
madeleine
rose
up
stifflyswayed
a
moment
as
she
stoodand
then
fell
unconscious
to
the
ground





next
day
in
the
dawn
lady
landale
came
into
her
sisters
bedroom
her
circled
eyes
her
drawn
face
bespeaking
a
sleepless
night
madeleine
was
lying
beautiful
and
white
like
a
broken
lily
in
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
sophia
an
unlovely
spectacle
in
curl
papers
wizened
and
redeyed
from
her
nights
watch
looked
up
warningly
from
the
armchair
beside
her
but
molly
went
unhesitatingly
to
the
window
pulled
the
curtains
unbarred
the
shutters
and
then
walked
over
to
the
bed
as
she
approached
madeleine
opened
her
blue
eyes
and
gazed
at
her
beseechingly
there
is
yet
time
said
molly
in
a
hollow
voice
get
up
and
come
with
me
the
wan
face
upon
the
pillow
grew
whiter
still
the
old
horror
grew
in
the
uplifted
eyes
the
wan
lips
murmured
i
cannot
there
was
an
immense
strength
of
resistance
in
the
girls
very
feebleness
molly
turned
away
abruptly
then
back
again
once
more
at
least
you
will
send
him
a
message
madeleine
drew
a
deep
breath
closed
her
eyes
a
moment
and
seemed
to
whisper
a
prayer
then
aloud
she
said
while
like
a
shadow
so
faint
was
it
a
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
tell
him
that
i
forgive
him
that
i
forgive
him
freelythat
i
shall
always
pray
for
him
the
flush
grew
deeper
tell
him
too
that
i
shall
never
be
any
mans
bride
now
she
closed
her
eyes
again
and
the
colour
slowly
ebbed
away
molly
stood
her
black
brows
drawn
gazing
down
upon
her
in
silencedid
she
love
him
after
all
who
can
fathom
the
mystery
of
anothers
heart
i
will
tell
him
she
answered
at
last
goodbye
madeleinei
shall
never
see
you
or
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
she
left
the
room
with
a
slow
heavy
step
madeleine
shivered
and
with
both
hands
clasped
the
silver
crucifix
that
hung
around
her
neck
two
great
tears
escaped
from
her
black
lashes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
miss
sophia
moaned
she
poor
soul
had
had
tragedy
enough
at
last





when
the
jailer
brought
in
the
midday
meal
after
adrians
departure
he
found
the
prisoner
seated
very
quietly
at
his
table
his
open
bible
before
him
but
his
eyes
fixed
dreamily
upon
the
space
of
dim
whitewashed
wall
and
his
mind
evidently
far
away
upon
his
guardians
entrance
he
roused
himself
however
and
begged
him
when
he
should
return
for
the
dish
to
restore
neatness
to
the
bed
and
to
assist
him
in
the
ordering
of
his
toilet
which
he
wished
to
be
spick
and
span
for
i
expect
a
visitor
said
captain
jack
gravely
when
in
due
course
the
fellow
had
carried
out
these
wishes
with
the
surly
goodnature
characteristic
of
him
jack
set
himself
to
wait
the
square
of
sky
through
his
window
grew
from
dazzling
white
to
deepest
blue
the
shadows
travelled
along
the
blank
walls
the
street
noises
rose
and
fell
in
capricious
gusts
the
church
bells
jangled
all
the
myriad
sounds
which
had
come
to
measure
his
solitary
day
struck
their
familiar
course
upon
his
ear
yet
the
expected
visitor
delayed
but
the
captain
among
other
things
had
learnt
to
possess
his
soul
in
patience
of
late
and
so
as
he
slowly
paced
his
cell
after
his
wont
he
betrayed
neither
irritation
nor
melancholy
if
she
did
not
come
today
then
it
would
be
tomorrow
he
had
no
doubt
of
this
the
afternoon
had
wanedgolden
without
full
of
grey
shadows
in
the
prison
roomwhen
light
footfalls
mingled
with
the
wellknown
heavy
tread
and
jangle
of
keys
along
the
echoing
passage
there
was
the
murmur
of
a
womans
voice
a
word
of
gruff
reply
and
the
next
moment
a
tall
form
wrapped
in
a
manyfolded
black
cloak
and
closely
veiled
advanced
a
few
steps
into
the
room
while
as
before
the
turnkey
retired
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
his
heart
beating
so
thickly
that
for
the
moment
utterance
was
impossible
captain
jack
made
one
hurried
pace
forward
with
outstretched
hands
only
to
check
himself
however
and
let
them
fall
by
his
side
he
would
meet
her
calmly
humbly
as
he
had
resolved
the
woman
threw
back
her
veil
and
it
was
mollys
dark
gaze
mollys
brown
face
flushed
and
haggard
yet
always
beautiful
that
looked
out
of
the
black
frame
an
ashen
pallor
spread
over
the
prisoners
countenance
madeleine
he
asked
in
a
whisper
then
with
a
loud
ring
of
stern
demand

went

she
would
not
come
it
is
a
sort
of
unwritten
law
that
the
supremely
afflicted
have
the
right
where
possible
to
the
gratification
of
the
least
of
their
wishes
that
madeleine
could
refuse
to
come
to
him
in
his
last
extremity

never

red

curved
in

a
coward
she
spat
the
word
fiercely
as
if
at
the
offenders
face
there
fell
a
minutes
silence
broken
only
by
a
few
labouring
deepdrawn
breaths
from
the
prisoners
oppressed
lungs
then
he
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
not
a
muscle
moving
his
eyes
fixed
his
jaw
set
molly
trembled
before
this
composure
beneath
which
she
divined
a
suffering
so
intense
that
her
own
frail
barriers
of
selfrestraint
were
wellnigh
broken
down
by
a
torrent
of
passionate
pity
but
she
braced
herself
with
the
feeling
of
the
moments
urgency
she
had
no
time
to
lose
hear
me
she
cried
in
low
hurried
tones
laying
a
hand
upon
his
folded
arm
and
then
drawing
it
away
again
as
if
frightened
by
the
rigid
tension
she
felt
there
waste
no
more
thought
on

so

captain
smith
jackjack
her
voice
rose
as
high
as
she
dare
lift
it
but
no
statue
could
be
more
unhearing
the
woman
cast
a
desperate
look
around
her
hearkened
fearfully
all
was
silent
within
the
prison
then
with
tremulous
haste
she
cast
off
her
immense
cloak
pulled
her
bonnet
from
her
head
divested
herself
of
her
long
full
skirt
and
stood
a
strange
vision
lithe
unconscious
unashamed
her
slender
womans
figure
clad
in
complete
mans
raiment
with
the
exception
of
the
coat
her
dark
head
cropped
and
curly
her
face
with
its
feverbloom
rising
flowerlike
above
the
folds
of
her
white
shirt
with
anxious
haste
she
compared
herself
with
the
prisoner
ren
told
me
well
she
said
with
your
coat
upon
me
none
would
tell
the
difference
in
this
dark
room
i
am
nearly
as
tall
as
you
too
thanks
be
to
god
that
he
made
me
so
jack
calling
in
his
ear
dont
you
see
dont
you
understand
it
is
all
quite
easy
you
have
only
to
put
on
these
clothes
of
mine
this
cloak
the
bonnet
comes
quite
over
the
face
stoop
a
little
as
you
go
out
and
hold
this
handkerchief
to
your
face
as
if
in
tears
the
carriage
waits
outside
and
ren
the
rest
is
planned
i
shall
sit
on
the
bed
with
your
coat
on
it
is
a
chancea
certainty
when
i
found
ren
had
failed
i
swore
that
i
would
save
you
yet
ever
since
i
came
from
pulwick
this
morning
he
and
i
have
worked
together
upon
this
last
plan
there
is
not
a
flaw
it
must
succeed
oh
god
he
does
not
hear
me
jackjack
she
shook
him
with
a
sort
of
fury
then
falling
at
his
feet
clasped
his
knees
for
gods
sakefor
gods
sake
he
sighed
and
again
came
the
murmur
she
would
not
come
he
lifted
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
looked
round
then
down
at
her
as
if
from
a
great
height
she
saw
that
he
was
aroused
at
last
sprang
to
her
feet
and
poured
out
the
details
of
the
scheme
again
i
run
no
risk
you
see
they
would
not
dare
to
punish
me
a
womanlady
landaleeven
if
they
could
be
quick
the
precious
moments
are
going
by
i
gave
the
man
some
gold
to
leave
us
as
long
as
he
could
but
any
moment
he
may
be
upon
us
poor
woman
said
jack
and
his
voice
seemed
as
far
off
as
his
gaze
see
these
chains
she
staggered
back
an
instant
but
the
next
crying
the
filethe
filethat
was
why
ren
gave
it
to
me
she
seized
the
skirt
as
it
lay
at
her
feet
and
striving
with
agonised
endeavours
to
control
the
trembling
of
her
hands
drew
forth
from
its
pocket
a
file
and
would
have
taken
his
wrist
but
he
held
his
hands
above
his
head
out
of
her
reach
while
a
strange
smile
almost
of
triumph
parted
his
lips
the
bitterness
of
death
is
past
he
said
she
tore
at
him
in
a
frenzy
but
repulsed
by
his
immobility
fell
again
broken
at
his
feet
in
a
torrent
of
words
she
besought
him
for
adrians
sake
for
the
sake
of
the
beautiful
world
of
his
youth
of
the
sweetness
of
lifein
her
madness
at
last
for
her
own
sake
she
had
ruined
him
but
she
would
atone
she
would
make
him
happy
yet
if
he
died
it
was
death
to
her
when
at
length
her
voice
sank
away
from
sheer
exhaustion
he
helped
her
to
rise
and
seated
her
on
the
chair
then
told
her
quietly
that
he
was
quite
determined
go
home
said
he
and
leave
me
in
peace
i
thank
you
for
what
you
would
have
done
thank
you
for
trying
to
bring
madeleine
he
paused
a
moment
how
purely
he
had
loved
herand
twice
twice
she
had
failed
him
yet
i
do
not
blame
her
he
went
on
as
if
to
himself
i
did
not
deserve
to
see
her
and
it
has
made
all
the
rest
easy
remember
again
addressing
the
woman
whom
hopelessness
seemed
for
a
moment
to
have
benumbed
that
if
you
would
yet
do
me
a
kindness
be
kind
to
her
if
you
would
atoneatone
to
adrian
to
adrian
echoed
molly
stung
to
the
quick
with
a
pale
smile
of
exceeding
bitterness
and
with
a
rush
of
pride
strength
returned
to
her
i
leave
you
resolved
to
die
then
she
asked
him
fiercely
you
leave
me
glad
to
die
he
replied
unhesitatingly
she
spoke
no
more
but
got
up
to
replace
her
garments
he
assisted
her
in
silence
but
as
his
awkward
bound
hands
touched
her
she
shuddered
away
from
him
as
she
gathered
the
cloak
round
her
shoulders
again
there
was
a
noise
of
heavy
feet
at
the
door
the
jailer
thrust
in
his
rusty
head
and
looked
furtively
from
the
prisoner
to
his
visitor
as
they
stood
silently
apart
from
each
other
then
making
a
sign
to
some
one
whose
dark
figure
was
shadowed
behind
him
without
entered
with
a
hesitating
sidelong
step
and
drawing
captain
jack
on
one
side
whispered
in
his
ear
the
blacksmiths
yonder
hes
come
to
measure
you
captain
for
them
there
irons
you
know
ofbest
get
the
lady
quietly
away
for
he
wunnut
wait
no
longer
the
prisoner
smiled
sternly
i
am
ready
he
said
aloud
ill
keep
him
outside
a
minute
or
two
added
the
man
wiping
his
brow
evidently
much
relieved
by
his
charges
calmness
i
kep
him
back
as
long
as
i
couldbut
happen
its
allus
best
to
hurry
the
parting
after
all
he
moved
away
upon
tiptoe
in
instinctive
tribute
to
the
ladys
sorrow
and
drew
the
door
to
molly
threw
back
her
veil
which
she
had
lowered
upon
his
entrance
her
face
was
livid
what
is
it
she
asked
articulating
with
difficulty
nothinga
fellow
to
see
to
my
irons
he
moved
his
hands
as
he
spoke
and
she
understood
him
as
he
had
hoped
to
refer
only
to
his
manacles
she
drew
a
gasping
breath
how
they
watched
him
yet
all
was
not
lost
after
all
i
will
leave
the
file
she
said
in
a
quick
whisper
you
will
reflect
there
is
yet
tomorrow
and
rushed
to
hide
it
in
his
bed
but
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
his
patience
worn
out
at
length
useless
he
answered
harshly
i
shall
not
use
it
moreover
it
would
be
found
and
i
am
sure
it
is
not
your
wish
to
bring
unnecessary
hardship
upon
my
last
moments
i
should
lose
the
only
thing
that
is
left
to
me
the
comfort
of
being
alone
and
tomorrow
i
shall
see
no
one
the
door
groaned
apart
very
sorry
mum
came
the
husky
voice
in
the
opening
times
up
she
turned
a
look
of
agony
upon
captain
jacks
determined
figure
was
this
to
be
the
end
was
she
to
leave
him
so
without
even
one
kind
word
alas
poor
soul
all
her
hopes
had
fallen
to
thisa
parting
word
he
was
unpitying
his
arms
were
folded
he
made
no
sign
she
took
a
step
away
and
swayed
the
turnkey
came
forward
compassionately
to
lead
her
out
but
the
next
instant
she
wheeled
round
and
stood
alone
and
erect
braced
up
by
the
extremity
of
her
anguish
i
have
a
message
she
cried
as
if
the
words
were
forced
from
her
i
could
not
make
her
come
but
i
made
her
send
you
a
message
she
told
me
to
say
that
she
forgave
you
freely
that
she
would
always
pray
for
you
she
bade
me
tell
you
too
that
she
would
never
be
any
mans
bride
now
it
had
been
like
the
rending
of
body
and
soul
to
tell
him
this
as
she
saw
the
condemned
mans
face
quiver
and
flush
at
last
out
of
its
impassiveness
she
thought
hell
itself
could
hold
no
more
hideous
torment
he
extended
his
arms
now
welcome
death
he
exclaimed
and
she
turned
and
fled
down
the
passage
as
though
driven
upon
this
last
cry





eh
he
be
a
strange
one
said
the
jailer
afterwards
to
his
mate

chapter
xxxiii
launched
on
the
great
wave
sir
adrian
made
at
first
personally
then
through
miss
odonoghue
two
attempts
to
induce
his
wife
to
return
to
pulwick
or
at
any
rate
to
leave
lancaster
on
the
next
day
but
the
contempt
then
the
fury
which
she
opposed
to
their
reasoning
rendered
it
worse
than
useless
the
very
sight
of
her
husband
indeed
seemed
to
exasperate
the
unfortunate
woman
to
such
a
degree
that
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
concerning
her
he
resolved
to
spare
her
even
to
the
consciousness
of
his
presence
and
absented
himself
altogether
from
the
house
miss
odonoghue
unable
to
cope
with
a
state
of
affairs
at
once
so
distressing
and
so
unbecoming
finally
retired
to
her
own
apartment
with
a
book
of
piety
and
some
gruel
and
abandoned
all
further
endeavour
to
guide
her
unruly
relations
so
that
molly
found
herself
left
to
her
own
resources
in
the
guardianship
of
ren
the
only
company
her
misery
could
tolerate
three
times
she
went
to
the
castle
to
be
met
each
time
with
the
announcement
that
by
the

to
him
again
then
in
restless
wandering
about
the
streetsonce
entering
the
little
chapel
where
the
silent
tabernacle
seemed
with
its
closed
door
to
offer
no
relenting
to
the
stormy
cry
of
her
soul
and
sent
her
forth
uncomforted
in
the
very
midst
of
rens
humble
beadtelling
to
pace

flags
anewso
the
terrible
day
wore
to
a
close
for
her
and
so
that
night
came
precursor
of
the
most
terrible
day
of
all
the
exhaustion
of
lady
landales
body
produced
at
last
a
fortunate
torpor
of
mind
flung
upon
her
bed
she
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
and
tanty
who
announced
her
intention
of
watching
her
when
rens
guardianship
had
of
necessity
to
cease
had
the
satisfaction
of
informing
adrian
as
he
crept
into
the
house
like
one
who
had
no
business
there
of
this
consoling
fact
before
retiring
herself
to
the
capacious
armchair
in
which
she
heroically
purposed
to
spend
the
night
the
sun
was
bright
in
the
heavens
there
was
a
clatter
and
bustle
in
the
street
when
molly
woke
with
a
great
start
out
of
this
sleep
of
exhaustion
her
heart
beating
with
heavy
strokes
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
gazed
upon
her
surroundings
with
startled
eyes
what
was
this
strange
feeling
of
oppression
of
terror
why
was
she
in
this
sordid
little
room
why
was
her
hair
cut
short
ah
my
god
memory
returned
upon
her
all
too
swiftly
it
was
for
todaytoday
and
she
was
perhaps
too
late
she
might
never
see
him
again
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
was
suffocating
sickening
as
she
slipped
out
of
bed
for
a
moment
she
hardly
dared
consult
the
little
watch
that
lay
ticking
upon
her
dressing
table
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
past
seven
there
was
yet
time
the
energy
of
her
desire
conquered
the
weakness
of
her
overwrought
nerves
noiselessly
so
as
to
avoid
awakening
the
slumbering
watcher
in
the
armchair
but
steadily
she
clothed
herself
wrapt
the
dark
mantle
round
her
and
then
pausing
for
a
moment
to
gaze
with
a
fierce
disdain
at
the
unconscious
face
of
miss
odonoghue
which
with
snores
emerging
energetically
and
regularly
from
the
great
hooked
nose
presented
a
weird
and
witchlike
vision
in
the
frame
of
a
nightcap
fearfully
and
wonderfully
befrilled
crept
from
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
at
rens
door
she
paused
and
knocked
he
opened
on
the
instant
from
his
worn
face
she
guessed
that
he
had
been
up
all
night
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
as
he
saw
her
and
glanced
meaningly
towards
the
bed
the
words
she
would
have
spoken
expired
in
a
quickdrawn
breath
her
husband
with
face
of
deathlike
pallor
and
silvered
hair
abroad
upon
the
pillow
lay
upon
the
poor
couch
still
in
his
yesterday
attire
but
covered
carefully
with
a
cloak
his
breast
rose
and
fell
peacefully
with
his
regular
breath
the
scorn
with
which
she
had
looked
at
miss
odonoghue
now
shot
forth
a
thousand
times
intensified
from
mollys
circled
eyes
upon
the
prostrate
figure
asleep
she
cried
and
then
with
that
incongruity
with
which
things
trivial
and
irrelevant
come
upon
us
even
in
the
supremest
moments
of
life
the
thought
struck
her
sharply
how
old
a
man
he
was
her
lip
curved
yes
my
ladyasleep
answered

seemed
as
if
the
faithful
peasant
had
read

her
soul
thank
god
asleep
it
is
enough
to
have
to
lose
one
good
gentleman
from
the
world
this
day
if
his
honour
were
not

at

i
should
not

upon
myself
to
put
some
of
the
medicine
that
he
has
had
to
take
now
and
again
when
his
sorrows
come
upon
him
and

cannot

it
has
had
a
good
effect
his
honour

sleep
three

four
hours
still
and
that
my
lady
must
be
his
honour
has
suffered
enough
these
last
days
god
knows
the
wife
turned
away
with
an
impatient
gesture
look
madame
at
his
white
hairs
all
white
nowthey
that
were
of
a
brown
so
beautiful
all
but
a
few
locks
only
a
few
months
past
well
may
he
look
old
when
was
ever
any
one
made
to
suffer
as
he
has
been
in
only
forty
years
of
life
ah
my
lady
we
were
at
least
tranquil
upon
our
island
there
was
a
volume
of
reproach
in
the
quiet
simplicity
of
the
words
though
lady
landale
was
too
bent
on
her
own
purpose
to
heed
them
but
she
felt
that
they
lodged
in
her
mind
that
she
would
find
them
there
later
but
not
nownot
now
it
is
to
be
for
nine
oclock
you
know
she
said
with
desperate
calmness
i
must
see
him
again
i
must
see
him
well
alone
i
shall
not
be
able
to
get
a
good
place
in
the
crowd
oh
i
would
see
all
she
added
with
a
terrible
laugh
ren
cast
a
glance
at
his
masters
placid
face
i
am
ready
to
come
with
my
lady
he
said
then
and
took
his
hat
a
turbulent
tender
april
day
it
was
gusts
of
west
wind
balmy
and
sweet
with
all
the
sweet
budding
life
of
the
fields
beyond
came
eddying
up
the
dusty
streets
and
blowing
merrily
into
the
faces
of
the
holiday
crowd
that
already
pressed
in
a
steady
stream
towards
the
castle
courtyard
to
see
the
hanging
in
those
days
there
were
hangings
so
many
after
assizes
that
an
execution
could
hardly
be
said
to
possess
the
interest
of
novelty
but
there
were
circumstances
enough
attending
the
forthcoming
show
to
give
it
quite
a
piquancy
of
its
own
in
the
eyes
of
the
worthy
lancastrian
burghers
who
hurried
with
wives
and
children
to
the
place
of
doom
anxious
to
secure
sitting
or
standing
room
with
a
good
view
of
the
gallowstree
it
was
not
every
day
indeed
that
a
gentleman
was
hanged
so
handsome
a
man
too
as
the
rumours
went
and
so
daredevil
a
fellow
friend
of
the
noble
family
of
landale
and
a
murderer
of
its
most
respected
member
could
justice
ever
have
served
up
a
spicier
dish
whereon
to
regale
the
multitude
first
the
courtyard
then
the
walls
the
roofs
of
the
adjoining
houses
swarmed
with
an
eager
crowd
every
space
of
ground
and
slate
and
tile
every
ledge
and
window
was
occupied
as
thick
as
bees
they
hungmen
women
and
children
a
sea
of
white
faces
pressed
together
each
still
yet
all
as
instinct
with
tremulous
movement
as
a
field
of
corn
in
the
wind
while
the
hoarse
indescribable
murmur
that
seizes
one
with
so
strange
and
fearsome
an
impression
the
voice
of
the
multitude
rose
and
fell
with
a
mighty
pulsation
broken
here
and
there
by
the
shriller
cry
of
a
child
overhead
the
sky
a
delicious
spring
blue
sky
flecked
with
tiny
white
clouds
looked
down
like
a
great
smile
upon
the
crowd
that
laughed
and
joked
beneath
no
pity
in
heaven
or
on
earth
but
as
the
felon
came
out
into
the
air
which
warm
and
fickle
puffed
against
his
cheek
he
cast
one
steady
glance
around
upon
the
black
human
hive
and
then
looked
up
into
the
white
flecked
ether
without
the
quiver
of
a
nerve
he
drew
the
spring
breath
into
his
lungs
with
a
grateful
expansion
of
his
deep
chest
how
fresh
it
was
and
the
sky
how
fair
and
blue
as
the
eagerly
expected
group
emerged
from
the
prison
door
and
was
greeted
by
a
roar
that
curdled
the
blood
in
at
least
one
womans
heart
there
an
old
irish
hag
who
sat
in
a
coign
of
vantage
hugging
her
knees
and
crooning
a
little
black
pipe
held
in
her
toothless
jaws
ceased
her
dismal
hum
to
concentrate
all
her
attention
upon
the
condemned
man
the
creature
was
well
known
for
miles
around
as
a
constant
attendant
at
such
spectacles
and
had
become
in
the
course
of
time
a
privileged
spectator
no
one
would
have
dreamt
of
disputing
the
first
place
to
old
judy
since
the
day
when
still
a
young
woman
she
had
seen
her
two
sons
mere
lads
hanged
the
one
for
sheepstealing
the
other
for
harbouring
the
booty
she
had
by
a
strange
freak
of
nature
taken
a
taste
for
the
spectacle
of
justice
at
work
and
what
had
been
the
cause
of
her
greatest
sorrow
became
the
only
solace
of
her
life
judy
and
her
pipe
had
become
as
familiar
a
figure
at
the
periodical
entertainment
as
the
executioner
himselfmore
so
indeed
for
she
had
seen
many
generations
of
these
latter
and
could
compare
their
styles
with
the
judgment
of
a
connoisseur
but
as
captain
jack
advanced
the
pallor
of
his
clean
shorn
handsome
face
illumined
not
so
much
by
the
morning
sun
without
it
seemed
as
by
the
shining
of
the
bright
spirit
within
as
gallantly
clad
as
he
had
ever
been
even
in
the
old
bath
days
when
he
had
been
courting
fair
madeleine
de
savenaye
his
head
proudly
uplifted
his
tread
firm
strong
of
soul
strong
of
bodysome
chord
was
struck
in
the
perverted
old
heart
that
had
so
long
revelled
in
unholy
and
gruesome
pleasure
she
drew
the
pipe
from
her
lips
and
broke
out
into
screeching
lamentations
oh
me
boy
me

me
beautiful
boy

she
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
shook
her
fist
wildly
in
the
face
of
one
of
the
sheriffs
men
a
woman
in
the
crowd
standing
rigid
and
motionless
enveloped
in
mourning
robes
here
suddenly
caught
up
the
words
with
a
muttering
lip

madam
cried
a
man
beside
her
who
seemed
in
such
anxiety
concerning
her
as
to
pay
little
heed
to
the
solemn
procession
which
was
now
attracting
universal
attention
let
me
take
you
away
but
she
looked
at
him
with
a
distraught
unseeing
eye
and
pulled
at
the
collar
of
her
dress
as
if
she
were
choking
old
judys
sudden
expression
of
opinion
created
a
small
disturbance
the
procession
had
to
halt
a
couple
of
officials
goodnaturedly
elbowed
her
on
one
side
but
she
thrust
a
withered
hand
expanded
in
protest
over
their
shoulders
as
the
prisoner
came
forward
again
god
bless
ye
honey
god
bless
ye
its
a
wicked
world
he
turned
towards
her
for
the
last
time
the
old
sweet
smile
sprang
to
lip
and
eye
thank
you
mother
he
said
and
raised
his
hand
to
his
bare
head
with
courteous
gesture
the
crowd
howled
and
swayed
he
passed
on
and
now
the
end
there
is
the
cart
the
officers
draw
back
to
make
way
for
the
man
who
is
to
help
him
with
his
final
toilet
the
chaplain
too
falls
away
after
wringing
his
hand
again
and
again
good
man
he
weeps
and
cannot
speak
the
sacred
words
he
would
why
weep
we
must
all
die
how
blue
the
sky
is
he
will
look
once
more
before
drawing
down
the
cap
upon
his
eyes
his
hands
are
free
for
he
is
to
die
as
like
a
gentleman
as
may
be
just
the
old
blue
that
used
to
smile
down
at
him
upon
his
merry
peregrine
and
up
at
him
from
the
dancing
waves
he
had
always
thought
he
would
have
liked
to
die
upon
the
sea
in
the
cool
fresh
water

a
clean
brave
death
it
is
hard
to
die
in
a
crowd
even
the
very
beasts
would
creep
into
cave
or
bush
to
die
decentlyunwatched
a
last
puff
of
sweeping
wind
in
his
face
then
darkness
blind
suffocating
ah
god
is
good
here
is
the
old
ship
giving
and
rising
under
his
feet
like
the
living
creature
he
always
thought
her
and
here
is
dazzling
brilliant
sunshine
all
around
so
bright
he
scarce
can
see
the
free
whitecrested
waves
that
are
dashing
down
upon
him

when
lady
landale
was
brought
back
to
her
home
from
lancaster
it
was
held
by
every
one
who
saw
her
that
death
had
laid
his
cold
finger
on
her
forehead
and
that
her
surrender
to
his
call
could
only
be
a
matter
of
hours
the
physician
in
attendance
could
point
out
no
reasonable
ground
for
hope
such
a
case
had
never
come
within
his
experience
or
knowledge
and
he
was
with
difficulty
induced
to
believe
that
it
was
not
the
result
of
actual
violence

lady

no

felt
for
the
miserable
wretch
in
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
imagination
aiding
her
she
realised
suddenly
the
horror
of
his
death
throes
and
this
vivid
realisation
was
followed
by
the
actual
simulacrum
of
the
torture
we
have
seen
hysterical
subjects
simulate
in
the
same
manner
diverse
diseases
of
which
they
themselves
are
organically
free

i
cannot
say
according
to
his
lights
he
had
bled
the
patient
as
he
would
have
bled
by
rote
to
recall
to
life
one
actually
cut
down
from
the
beam
but
although
the
young
blood
did
flow
bearing
testimony
to
the
fact
that
the
heart
still
beat
in
that
deathlike
frame
the
vitality
left
seemed
so
faint
as
to
defy
the
power
of
human
ministration
the
flame
of
life
barely
flickered
but
the
powers
of
youth
were
of
greater
strength
in
the
unconscious
body
than
could
have
been
suspected
and
gradually
almost
imperceptibly
they
asserted
themselves
with
the
return
of
animation
however
came
a
new
danger
fever
burning
devastating
more
terrible
even
than
the
almost
mortal
syncope
that
fever
of
the
brain
which
wastes
like
the
rack
before
which
science
stands
helpless
and
the
watcher
sinks
into
despair
at
his
impotence
to
screen
a
beloved
sufferer
from
the
horrible
everrecurring
phantoms
of
delirium
had
not
sir
adrian
intuitively
known
wellnigh
every
act
of
the
drama
which
had
already
been
so
fatal
to
his
house
mollys
frenzied
utterances
would
have
told
him
all
every
secret
incident
of
that
storm
of
passion
which
had
desolated
her
life
was
laid
bare
to
his
sorrowing
hearther
aspirations
for
an
ideal
centred
suddenly
upon
one
man
her
love
rapture
cruelly
baulked
at
every
step
the
consuming
of
that
love
fire
resisting
all
frustration
of
hope
all
efforts
of
conscience
of
honour
how
her
whole
being
became
merged
into
that
of
the
man
she
loved
and
whom
she
had
ruined
her
life
in
his
life
her
very
breath
in
his
breath
and
then
the
lamentable
inevitable
end
the
fearful
confrontation
with
his
death
again
and
again
in
never
ceasing
repetition
was
that
fair
most
dear
body
that
harrowed
soul
dragged
step
by
step
through
every
iota
of
the
past
torture
always
to
fall
at
last
into
the
same
stillness
of
exhaustionappalling
image
of
final
death
that
wrung
adrian
with
untold
agonies
of
despair
for
many
days
this
condition
of
things
lasted
unaltered
in
the
physicians
own
words
it
was
impossible
that
life
could
much
longer
resist
such
fierce
onslaughts
but
one
evening
a
change
came
over
the
spirit
of
the
sufferers
vision
there
had
been
a
somewhat
longer
interval
between
the
paroxysms
sir
adrian
seated
as
usual
by
the
bed
waiting
now
with
a
sinking
heart
for
the
wonted
return
of
the
frenzy
clamouring
in
his
soul
to
heaven
for
pity
on
one
whom
seemingly
no
human
aid
could
succour
dared
yet
draw
no
shadow
of
hope
from
the
more
prolonged
stillness
of
the
patient
presently
indeed
she
grew
restless
tossed
her
arms
muttered
with
parched
lips
then
she
suddenly
sat
up
and
listened
as
if
to
some
deeply
annoying
and
disquieting
sound
fell
back
again
under
his
gentle
hands
rolling
her
little
black
head
wearily
from
side
to
side
only
however
to
start
again
and
again
listen
thus
it
went
on
for
a
while
until
the
haunted
weary
eyes
grew
suddenly
distraught
with
terror
and
loathing
straining
them
into
space
as
if
seeking
something
she
ought
to
see
but
could
not
she
began
to
speak
in
a
quick
yet
distinct
whisper
how
it
creaks
creakscreaks
will
no
one
stop
that
creaking
what
is
it
that
creaks
so
will
no
one
stop
that
creaking
and
again
she
placed
her
cheek
on
the
pillow
covering
her
ear
with
her
little
wasted
hand
and
for
a
while
remained
motionless
moaning
like
a
child
but
it
was
only
to
spring
up
again
this
time
with
a
cry
which
brought
the
physician
from
the
adjacent
sleeping
room
in
alarm
to
her
bedside
ah
god
she
shrieked
her
eyes
distended
and
staring
as
if
into
the
far
distance
through
walls
and
outlying
darkness
i
see
it
they
have
done
it
they
have
done
it
it
is
hanging
on
the
sandshow
it
creaks
and
sways
in
the
wind
it
will
creak
for
ever
for
ever
now
it
spins
round
it
looks
this
waythe
black
face
it
looks
at
me
she
gave
another
piercing
cry
then
her
frame
grew
rigid
with
mouth
open
and
fixed
eyeballs
she
seemed
lost
in
the
frightful
fascination
of
the
image
before
her
brain
as
distracted
by
the
sight
of
her
torments
adrian
hung
over
her
racking
his
mind
in
the
endeavour
to
soothe
her
her
words
struck
a
chill
into
his
very
soul
he
cast
a
terrified
glance
at
the
doctor
who
was
ominously
feeling
her
pulse
there
is
a
change
he
faltered
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
told
you
before
he
retorted
irritably
that
you
should
attach
no
more
importance
to
the
substance
of
these
delirious
wanderings
than
you
would
to
the
ravings
of
madness
it
is
the
fact
of
the
delirium
itself
which
must
alarm
us
she
is
less
and
less
able
to
bear
it
the
patient
moaned
and
shuddered
resisting
the
gentle
force
that
would
have
pressed
her
down
on
her
pillow
oh
the
creaking
the
creaking
will
no
one
stop
that
creaking
must
i
hear
it
go
on
creak
creak
creak
for
ever
and
see
it
sway
and
sway
will
no
one
ever
stop
it
sir
adrian
took
a
sudden
resolution
i
will
he
said
low
and
clear
into
her
ear
she
sank
down
on
the
instant
and
looked
at
him
back
from
her
far
distance
almost
as
if
she
understood
him
and
the
pitiful
cry
for
the
help
he
would
have
given
his
hearts
blood
to
procure
for
her
was
silent
for
the
moment
upon
her
lips
i
will
prepare
an
opiate
said
the
physician
in
a
whisper
and
i
said
sir
adrian
to
him
with
a
strange
expression
upon
his
pale
face
am
going
to
stop
that
creaking
the
man
of
medicine
gazed
after
him
with
a
look
of
intense
astonishment
which
rapidly
changed
to
one
of
professional
interest
it
is
evident
that
i
shall
soon
have
another
mentally
deranged
patient
to
see
to
he
remarked
to
himself
as
he
rose
to
seek
the
drugs
he
meant
to
administer
downstairs
sir
adrian
immediately
called
for
ren
and
being
informed
that
he
had
left
for
the
island
early
in
the
afternoon
and
had
announced
his
return
before
night
cast
a
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
hurried
forth
in
the
hope
of
meeting
him
upon
his
homeward
way
his
pulses
were
beating
wellnigh
as
wildly
as
those
of
the
fever
stricken
woman
upstairs
in
the
house
he
dared
not
pause
to
reflect
on
his
purpose
or
seek
to
disentangle
the
confusion
of
his
thoughts
for
fear
of
being
confronted
with
the
hopelessness
of
their
folly
but
the
exquisite
serenity
of
the
night
sky
where
swam
the
moon
a
silver
splendour
the
freshness
of
the
sweeping
breeze
that
dashed
keen
from
the
east
over
the
sea
against
his
face
all
the
glorious
distance
the
unconsciousness
and
detachment
of
nature
from
the
fume
and
misery
of
life
brought
him
unwittingly
to
a
calmer
mood
he
had
reached
the
extreme
confine
of
the
pine
wood
when
across
the
sands
that
stretched
unbroken
to
the
lips
of
the
sea
a
figure
advanced
towards
him
renny
called
sir
adrian
your
honour
cried
the
man
breaking
into
a
run
to
meet
him
o
god
how
ghostly
white
looked
the
masters
face
in
the

my

not

there
is

sinking
his
voice
and
clasping
the
mans
sturdy
arm
with
clammy
hand
is
it
true
they
have
placed
him
on

how
could
it
have
come
so
soon
to
your
honours
ears
this
morning
indeed
they
came
from
the
town
in
a
cart
and
planted
the
great
gibbet
on
scarthey
point
at

and
tonight
they
brought
the

its
creaking
renny
as
it
swayed
in
the
wind
again
ren
cast
a
quick
glance
of
alarm
at
his
master
the
master
had
a
singular
manner
with
him
tonight
then
edging
closer
to
him
he
whispered
in
his
ear
they
say
it
is
to
hang
for
ever
there
is
a
warning
to
those
who
would
interfere
with
this
justice
of
theirs
but
your
honour
there
came
one
to
the
island
today
i
do
not
know
if
your
honour
knows
him
the
captains
second
on
that
vessel
of
misfortune
and
i
believe
your
honour
the
dawn
will
never
see
that
poor
black
body
hanging
over
yonder
like
a
scarecrow
to
spoil
our
view
this
man
this
brave
mariner
curwen
is
his
name
he
is
mad
furious
with
us
all
he
has
just
but
come
from
hearing
of
his
captains
fate
and
he
is
ready
to
kill
us
that
we
let
him
be
murdered
without
breaking
some
heads
for
him
faith
if
it
could
have
done
any
good
it
is
not
i
that
would
have
balanced
about
it
but
as
i
told
him
there
was
no
use
running
ones
own
head
into
a
loop
of
rope
when
that
would
please
nobody
but
mr
the
judge
but
he
is
not
to
be
reasoned
with
he
is
like
a
wild
animal
when
i
left
him
said
ren
dropping
his
voice
still
lower
he
was
knocking
a
coffin
together
out
of
the
old
sea
wood
on
scarthey
he
said
his
captain
would
rest
better
in
those
boards
that
were
seasoned
with
salt
water
and
when
i
went
away
your
honour
and
left
him
hammering
therefaith
i
thought
that
the
coffin
was
like
to
be
seasoned
by
another
kind
of
salt
water
too
his
face
twitched
and
the
ready
tears
sprang
to
his
own
eyes
which
unashamed
he
now
wiped
with
his
sleeve
after
his
custom
but
sir
adrians
mind
was
still
drifting
in
distant
ghastly
companionship
how
the
wind
blows
he
said
and
shuddered
a
little
how
the
poor
body
must
sway
in
the
wind
and
the
chains
creak
if
it
can
make
any
difference
to
the
poor
captain
he
will
lie
in
peace
tonight
please
god
said
ren
ay
said
sir
adrian
and
you
and
i
friend
will
go
too
and
help
this
good
fellow
in
his
task
i
hope
i
believe
that
i
should
have
done
this
thing
of
my
own
thought
had
i
had
time
to
think
at
all
but
now
more
hangs
upon
those
creaking
chains
than
you
can
dream
of
this
is
a
strange
worldand
it
is
full
of
ghosts
tonight
but
we
must
hurry
renny





bound
even
to
the
tips
of
her
burning
little
fingers
by
the
spell
of
the
opiate
lady
landale
lay
in
the
shadowed
room
as
one
dead
yet
in
her
sick
brain
fearfully
awake
keenly
alive
at
first
it
was
as
if
she
too
was
manacled
in
chains
till
she
could
not
move
a
muscle
could
not
breathe
or
cry
because
of
the
ring
round
her
breast
and
she
was
hanging
with
the
black
figure
swaying
while
the
rusty
iron
links
went
creak
creak
creak
with
every
swing
to
and
fro
then
suddenly
she
seemed
to
stand
as
it
were
out
of
herself
and
to
be
seeing
with
the
naked
soul
alone
and
what
she
saw
was
the
great
stretch
of
beach
and
sea
white
white
white
in
the
moonlight
and
spreading
it
seemed
for
leagues
and
leagues
spreading
till
all
the
world
was
only
beach
and
sea
but
close
to
her
in
the
whitest
moonlight
rose
the
great
gibbet
gaunt
and
black
cutting
the
pale
sky
in
two
and
athwart
and
hanging
from
it
was
the
black
figure
that
swayed
and
swung
and
though
the
winds
muttered
and
the
waves
growled
she
could
not
hear
them
with
the
ears
of
the
soul
for
that
the
whole
of
this
great
world
of
sea
and
sand
was
filled
with
the
creaking
of
the
chains
but
now
across
the
bleak
and
pallid
spaces
came
three
black
figures
and
as
she
looked
and
watched
and
they
drew
nearer
the
dreadful
burthen
of
the
gibbet
swung
round
as
if
to
greet
them
and
she
too
felt
in
her
soul
that
she
knew
them
all
three
though
not
by
names
as
creatures
of
earth
know
each
other
but
by
the
kinship
of
the
soul
this
man
with
hair
as
white
as
the
white
beach
hair
that
seemed
to
shine
silver
as
he
came
and
him
yonder
who
followed
him
as
a
dog
his
master
and
yonder
again
the
third
in
the
seamans
dress
with
hard
face
hewn
into
such
rugged
lines
of
grief
and
furyshe
knew
them
all
and
next
they
reached
the
gibbet
and
one
swarmed
up
the
black
post
and
hammered
and
filed
and
prised
and
then
oh
merciful
god
the
creaking
stopped
at
last
now
she
could
hear
the
wash
of
the
waves
the
rush
of
the
wholesome
wind
a
mist
came
across
her
vision
faintly
she
saw
the
stiffened
disfigured
corpse
which
yet
she
felt
had
once
been
something
she
had
loved
with
passion
laid
reverently
upon
a
stretcher
its
irons
loosened
and
cast
away
and
then
covered
with
a
great
cloak
then
the
sea
the
beach
the
white
moon
faded
and
waved
and
receded
mollys
soul
went
back
to
her
body
again
while
blessed
tears
fell
one
by
one
from
her
hot
eyes
she
breathed
her
limbs
relaxed
round
the
tired
brain
came
with
a
soft
hush
like
that
of
gentle
wings
dark
oblivion
bending
over
her
for
he
was
aware
that
for
good
or
evil
the
crisis
was
at
hand
the
physician
saw
moisture
bead
upon
the
suddenly
smoothed
brow
heard
a
deep
sigh
escape
the
parted
lips
and
then
with
a
movement
like
a
weary
childs
she
drew
her
arms
close
and
fell
asleep





having
laid
his
friend
to
his
secret
rest
deep
in
the
rock
of
scarthey
where
the
free
waves
that
his
soul
had
revelled
in
would
beat
till
the
worlds
end
sir
adrian
returned
to
pulwick
in
the
early
morning
spent
with
the
long
and
heavy
nights
toilfor
it
had
taxed
the
strength
of
even
three
men
to
hollow
out
a
grave
in
such
a
soil
on
the
threshold
he
was
greeted
by
the
physician
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
the
messengers
of
glad
tidings
from
afar
by
the
mans
demeanour
he
knew
that
the
tidings
were
glad
and
most
blessed
they
were
indeed
to
his
ears
but
to
them
alone
not
strange
throughout
every
detail
of
his
errand
his
mind
had
dwelt
rather
with
the
living
than
the
dead
what
he
had
done
he
had
done
for
her
and
now
the
task
achieved
it
seemed
but
natural
that
the
object
for
which
it
had
been
undertaken
should
have
been
achieved
likewise
but
left
once
more
with
her
seeing
her
once
more
wrapt
in
placid
sleep
whom
he
had
thought
he
would
never
behold
at
rest
again
save
in
the
last
sleep
of
all
the
revulsion
was
overpowering
he
sat
down
by
her
side
and
through
his
tears
gazed
long
at
the
lovely
head
now
in
its
pallor
and
emaciation
so
sadly
like
that
of
his
dead
love
in
the
sorrowful
days
of
youth
and
he
thanked
heaven
that
he
was
still
of
the
earth
to
shield
her
with
his
devotion
to
cherish
her
who
was
now
so
helpless
and
bereft
and
with
such
tears
and
such
thoughts
came
a
forgetfulness
of
that
anguish
which
in
him
as
well
as
in
her
had
for
so
long
been
part
of
actual
existence
when
tanty
entered
on
tiptoe
some
hours
later
she
saw
her
niece
motionless
upon
her
pillow
sleeping
as
easily
and
reposefully
as
a
child
and
close
to
her
head
sir
adrian
reclining
in
the
armchair
asleep
likewise
his
arm
was
stretched
limply
over
the
bed
and
on
its
sleeve
still
stained
with
the
red
mud
of
the
grave
in
scarthey
rested
lady
landales
little
thin
ivorywhite
fingers





thus
ended
mollys
brief
but
terrible
madness
then
you
have
hope
real
hope
asked
sir
adrian
of
the
physician
as
they
met
again
that
day
in
the
gallery
every
hope
replied
the
man
of
science
with
the
proud
consciousness
of
having
by
his
wisdom
pulled
his
patient
out
of
the
very
jaws
of
death
recovery
is
now
but
a
question
of
a
time
of
a
long
time
of
course
for
this
crisis
has
left
her
weaker
than
the
newborn
babe
repose
complete
repose
sleep
that
is
almost
everything
and
she
will
sleep
happily
as
usual
in
such
cases
lady
landale
seems
to
have
lost
all
memory
but
i
must
impress
upon
you
sir
adrian
that
the
longer
we
can
keep
her
in
this
state
the
better
if
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
even
the
sight
of
you
might
recall
distressing
impressions
you
must
let
me
request
of
you
to
keep
away
from
the
sick
room
till
your
wifes
strength
be
sufficiently
restored
to
be
able
to
face
emotions
this
was
said
with
a
certain
significance
which
called
the
colour
to
sir
adrians
cheek
he
acquiesced
however
without
hesitation
and
banished
from
the
place
where
his
treasure
lay
fell
to
haunting
the
passages
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
to
waylaying
the
privileged
attendants
with
a
humble
resignation
which
would
have
been
sorrowful
but
for
the
savour
of
his
recent
relief
from
anguish
but
the
next
morning
lady
landale
though
too
weak
of
body
to
lift
a
finger
too
weak
of
mind
to
connect
a
single
coherent
phrase
nevertheless
took
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
and
proved
that
it
is
as
easy
to
err
upon
the
side
of
prudence
as
upon
its
reverse
miss
odonoghue
emerging
silently
from
the
room
after
her
nights
vigil
came
upon
her
nephew
at
his
post
and
struck
to
her
kind
heart
by
his
wistful
countenance
bade
him
with
many
winks
and
nods
enter
and
have
a
look
at
his
wife
dont
make
a
sound
she
whispered
to
him
and
then
she
wont
hear
you
but
faith
shes
sleeping
so
well
its
my
belief
if
you
danced
a
jig
she
would
not
stir
a
limb
go
in
child
go
in
its
beautiful
to
see
her
and
adrian
pressed
by
his
own
longing
was
unable
to
resist
the
offer
noiselessly
he
stepped
across
the
forbidden
threshold
and
stood
for
a
long
time
contemplating
the
sleeper
in
the
dim
light
as
he
was
about
to
creep
out
at
length
she
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
wonderingly
upon
him
fearful
of
having
done
the
cruel
deed
against
which
he
had
been
warned
he
felt
his
heart
contract
and
would
have
rushed
away
in
an
agony
of
selfaccusation
when
there
occurred
what
seemed
to
him
a
miracle
a
faint
smile
came
upon
the
pale
lips
and
narrowed
ever
so
little
the
large
sunken
eyes
yes
by
all
that
was
beautiful
it
was
a
smiletransient
and
piteous
but
a
smile
and
for
him
as
he
bent
forward
almost
incapable
of
believing
the
lips
relaxed
again
and
the
lids
drooped
but
she
shifted
her
hands
upon
the
bed
uneasily
as
if
seeking
something
he
knelt
trembling
by
her
side
and
as
with
diffident
fingers
he
clasped
the
wandering
hands
he
felt
them
faintly
cling
to
his
and
his
heart
melted
all
in
joy
the
man
of
science
had
reasoned
astray
there
need
be
no
separation
between
the
husband
who
would
so
dearly
console
and
the
wife
who
needed
help
so
sorely
for
a
long
while
he
remained
thus
kneeling
and
holding
her
hands
it
seemed
as
though
some
of
the
life
strength
he
longed
to
be
able
to
pour
from
himself
to
her
actually
passed
into
her
frame
as
though
there
were
indeed
a
healing
virtue
in
his
all
encompassing
tenderness
for
after
a
while
a
faint
colour
came
to
the
sunken
cheeks
and
presently
still
holding
his
hand
she
fell
once
more
into
that
slumber
which
was
now
her
healing
after
this
it
was
found
that
the
patient
actually
became
fretful
and
fevered
again
when
her
husband
was
too
long
absent
from
her
side
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
supersede
all
other
watchers
in
her
room
tanty
in
highest
good
humour
declared
that
her
services
were
no
longer
necessary
and
volunteered
to
conduct
madeleine
to
the
jersey
convent
whither
her
decision
being
irrevocable
it
was
generally
felt
that
it
would
be
well
for
the
latter
to
proceed
before
her
sisters
memory
with
returning
strength
should
have
returned
likewise
this
memory
without
which
the
being
he
loved
would
remain
afflicted
and
incomplete
yet
upon
the
working
of
which
so
much
that
was
still
uncertain
must
hingesir
adrian
at
once
yearned
for
and
dreaded
it
many
a
time
as
he
met
the
sweet
and
joyful
greeting
in
those
eyes
where
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
find
nought
but
either
mockery
or
disdain
did
he
recall
his
friends
prophetic
words
out
of
my
death
will
grow
your
happiness
was
there
happiness
indeed
yet
in
store
in
the
future
alas
happiness
for
them
dwelt
in
oblivion
and
some
day
remembrance
would
wake
with
all
her
busy
train
and
swell
at
her
breast
and
then
meanwhile
however
the
present
had
a
sweetness
of
its
own
there
was
now
free
scope
for
the
passion
of
devotedness
which
almost
made
up
the
sum
of
this
mans
charactera
character
which
to
the
molly
of
wayward
days
to
the
hotpulsed
eager
impatient
murthering
moll
had
been
utterly
incomprehensible
and
uncongenial
and
to
the
molly
crushed
in
the
direst
battle
of
life
whom
one
more
harshness
of
fate
even
the
slightest
would
have
straightaway
hurled
back
into
the
grave
that
had
barely
been
baulked
of
its
prey
it
gave
the
very
food
and
breath
of
her
new
existence
week
after
week
passed
in
this
guise
during
which
her
natural
healthiness
slowly
but
surely
reestablished
itself
weeks
that
were
happy
to
him
in
later
life
to
look
back
upon
though
now
full
of
an
anxiousness
which
waxed
stronger
as
recovery
drew
nearer
there
was
little
talking
between
them
and
that
kept
by
him
studiously
on
subjects
of
purely
ephemeral
childish
interest
her
mind
by
the
happy
dispensation
of
nature
which
facilitates
healing
by
all
means
when
once
healing
has
begun
was
blank
to
any
impressions
save
the
luxury
of
rest
of
passive
enjoyment
indifferent
to
ought
but
the
passing
present
she
took
pleasure
in
flowers
in
the
gambols
of
pet
animals
in
long
listless
spells
of
cloudgazing
when
the
heavens
were
bright
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
in
whom
she
only
saw
a
being
whose
eyes
were
always
beautiful
with
the
light
of
kindness
whose
touch
invariably
soothed
her
when
fatigue
or
irritation
marred
the
even
course
of
her
feelings
she
had
ever
a
smile
for
him
which
entered
his
soul
like
the
radiance
of
sunshine
through
a
stormy
sky
thus
the
days
went
by
like
a
child
she
ate
and
slept
and
chatteredirresponsible
chatter
that
was
music
to
his
ear
she
laughed
and
teased
him
too
as
a
child
would
till
sad
as
it
was
he
hugged
the
incomplete
happiness
to
his
heart
with
a
dire
foreboding
that
it
might
be
all
he
was
to
know
in
life
but
one
evening
in
sudden
freak
she
bade
him
open
the
shutters
pull
the
curtains
and
raise
the
window
that
she
might
from
her
pillow
look
forth
upon
the
night
and
smell
the
sweet
night
air
she
had
been
unusually
well
that
day
and
on
her
face
now
filling
out
once
more
into
its
old
soft
oval
bloomed
again
a
look
of
warm
life
and
youth
unsuspecting
unthinking
sir
adrian
obeyed
it
was
a
dim
close
night
and
the
blushroses
nodded
palely
into
the
room
from
the
outer
darkness
as
he
raised
the
sash
there
was
no
moon
no
stars
shone
in
the
mist
hung
sky
there
was
no
light
to
be
seen
anywhere
except
one
faint
glimmer
in
the
distancethe
light
upon
scarthey
island
is
that
a
star
said
molly
after
a
moments
dreamy
silence
sir
adrian
started
a
vision
of
all
that
might
hang
upon
his
answer
flashed
through
his
brain
with
a
trembling
hand
he
pulled
the
curtain
it
was
too
late
molly
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
contracted
brow
and
hands
outstretched
as
one
who
would
seize
a
tantalising
escaping
memory
i
used
to
watch
it
then
at
night
from
this
window
she
whispered
what
was
it
the
light
of
scarthey
then
suddenly
with
a
scream
the
light
of
scarthey
adrian
sprang
to
her
side
but
she
turned
from
him
shrank
from
him
with
a
look
of
dread
which
seared
him
to
the
soul
do
not
come
near
me
do
not
touch
me
she
cried
and
then
he
left
her





miss
odonoghue
was
gone
upon
her
journey
with
madeleine
there
was
none
in
whom
he
might
confide
with
whom
seek
counsel
but
presently
listening
outside
the
door
in
an
agony
of
suspense
he
heard
a
storm
of
sobs
in
time
these
gradually
subsided
and
later
he
learnt
from
moggie
whom
he
had
hurriedly
ordered
to
her
mistresss
side
that
his
wife
was
quiet
and
seemed
inclined
to
rest
on
the
next
day
she
expressed
no
desire
to
see
him
and
he
dared
not
go
to
her
unsought
he
gathered
a
great
dewy
bunch
of
roses
and
had
them
brought
to
her
upon
her
breakfast
tray
instead
of
bringing
them
himself
as
had
been
his
wont
she
had
taken
the
roses
moggie
told
him
and
laid
them
to
her
cheek
the
master
sent
them
said
i
continued
the
sturdy
little
matron
who
was
far
from
possessing
the
instinctive
tact
of
her
spouse
an
she
get
agate
ocrying
quiet
like
and
let
the
flowers
fall
out
of
her
hands
on
the
bedeh
what
evers
coom
to
her
sin
yesterday
wannut
you
go
in
sir
not
unless
she
sends
for
me
said
sir
adrian
hastily
and
remember
moggie
do
not
speak
my
name
to
her
she
must
not
be
worried
or
distressed
but
if
she
sends
for
me
come
at
once
you
will
find
me
in
the
library
and
in
the
library
he
sat
the
long
long
day
waiting
for
the
summons
that
did
not
come
she
never
sent
for
him
she
had
wept
a
good
deal
during
the
day
the
faithful
reporter
told
him
in
the
evening
but
always
quiet
like
had
spoken
little
and
though
of
unwonted
gentleness
of
manner
had
persistently
declined
to
be
carried
to
the
garden
as
usual
or
even
to
leave
her
room
now
she
had
gone
back
to
bed
and
was
sleeping
peacefully
an
hour
later
sir
adrian
left
his
home
for
scarthey
once
again
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
his
existence
he
ever
carried
into
the
sheltering
ruins
a
heart
more
full
of
cruel
pain
when
tanty
returned
to
pulwick
from
her
travels
again
it
was
to
find
in
miss
landale
the
only
member
of
the
family
waiting
to
greet
her
the
old
ladys
displeasure
on
learning
the
reason
of
this
defection
was
at
first
too
intense
to
find
relief
in
words
but
presently
the
strings
of
her
tongue
were
loosened
under
the
influence
of
the
usual
feminine
restorative
and
failing
a
better
listener
she
began
to
dilate
upon
the
situation
with
her
wonted
garrulity
yes
my
good
sophia
i
will
thank
you
for
another
cup
of
tea
what
should
we
do
without
tea
in
this
weary
world
i
declare
its
the
only
pleasure
left
to
me
nowfor
of
all
the
ungrateful
things
in
life
working
for
your
posterity
is
the
most
ungrateful
posterity
is
born
to
trample
on
one
and
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
exactly
how
matters
stand
my
niece
is
greatly
better
i
hear
the
doctor
considers
her
quite
convalescent
at
least
this
is
very
satisfactory
very
satisfactory
indeed
just
now
she
is
resting
quite
so
i
should
not
dream
of
disturbing
her
more
especially
as
the
sight
of
me
would
probably
revive
painful
memories
and
we
must
not
risk
her
having
a
bad
nightof
course
not
ah
my
dear
memory
like
ones
teeth
is
a
very
doubtful
blessing
far
more
trouble
than
pleasure
when
you
have
it
and
yet
a
dreadful
nuisance
when
you
have
notbut
whats
this
i
hear
about
adrian
gone
back
to
that
detestable
island
of
his
again
i
left
him
and
molly
smiling
into
each
others
eyes
clasping
each
others
hands
like
two
turtledoves
why
she
could
not
as
much
as
swallow
a
mouthful
of
soup
unless
he
was
beside
her
to
feed
herand
now
i
am
told
he
has
not
been
near
her
for
four
days
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
oh
dont
talk
to
me
sophia
its
more
than
flesh
and
blood
can
bear
here
am
i
having
been
backward
and
forward
over
nine
hundred
miles
looking
after
you
all
at
my
age
till
i
dont
know
which
it
is
lancashire
or
somerset
im
in
or
whether
im
on
my
head
or
my
heels
though
im
sure
i
can
count
every
bone
of
my
body
by
the
aching
of
themand
i
did
think
i
was
coming
back
to
a
little
peace
and
comfort
at
length
that
island
of
his
sophia
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
wish
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
that
is
the
only
thing
that
will
bring
your
brother
to
his
senses
i
believe
now
he
might
as
well
be
in
his
grave
at
once
like
rupert
for
all
the
good
he
is
though
for
that
matter
its
more
harm
than
good
poor
rupert
ever
did
while
he
was
alive
excuse
me
aunt
rose
here
exclaimed
sophia
heroically
her
corkscrew
ringlets
trembling
with
agitation
but
i
must
beg
you
to
refrain
from
such
remarksi
cannot
hear
my
dear
brother
but
miss
odonoghue
waved
the
interruption
peremptorily
away
now
its
no
use
your
going
on
sophia
we
dont
think
a
man
flies
straight
to
heaven
just
because
hes
dead
and
nothing
will
ever
make
me
approve
of
ruperts
conduct
in
all
this
dreadful
business
of
course
one
must
not
speak
evil
of
those
who
cant
defend
themselves
but
for
all
that
he
is
dead
and
buried
rupert
might
argue
with
me
from
now
till
doomsday
and
he
never
would
convince
me
that
it
is
the
part
of
a
gentleman
to
act
like
a
bow
street
runner
i
hope
my
dear
he
has
found
more
mercy
than
he
gave
i
hope
so
but
only
for
him
my
poor
dear
grandniece
molly
would
never
have
gone
off
on
that
mad
journey
and
my
poor
grandniece
madeleine
would
not
be
buried
alive
on
that
other
island
at
the
back
of
gods
speed
ah
yes
my
dear
it
has
been
a
very
sad
time
i
declare
i
felt
all
the
while
as
if
i
were
conducting
a
corpse
to
be
buried
and
now
i
feel
as
if
i
had
come
back
from
the
dear
girls
funeral
we
had
a
dreadful
passage
and
she
was
so
sick
that
im
afraid
even
if
she
wanted
to
come
out
of
that
place
again
shed
never
have
the
courage
to
face
the
crossing
she
was
a
wrecka
perfect
wreck
when
she
reached
the
convent
many
a
time
i
thought
she
would
only
land
to
find
herself
dead
i
wanted
her
to
come
to
the
hotel
with
me
where
i
should
have
popped
her
into
bed
with
a
hot
bottle
but
nothing
would
serve
her
but
that
she
must
go
to
the
convent
at
once
i
shall
not
be
able
to
rest
till
i
am
there
she
said
and
its
precious
little
rest
you
will
get
there
said
i
if
its
rest
you
wantwhat
with
the
hard
beds
and
all
the
prayers
you
have
to
say
and
the
popping
out
of
bed
as
soon
as
you
are
asleep
to
sing
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
those
blessed
little
bells
going
every
three
minutes
and
a
half
there
is
no
rest
in
a
convent
my
dear
but
i
might
as
well
have
talked
to
the
wall
when
i
went
to
see
her
the
next
day
true
enough
she

would

there
there
we
wont
discuss
the

any

poor
darling
so
i
left
her
i
declare
i
never
liked
her
so
much
as
when
i
said
goodbye
for
i
felt
id
never
see
her
again

thus
you
know

connection
of
mine
she
was
an
heiress

chose
the

them
at

they

charges
i
also
am
entitled
to
bear
as
you
know
or
rather
dont
know
i
presume
for
you
have
all
the
haziest
notion
of
what
sort
of
blood
it
is
that
runs
in
your

well
as
i
said
she
is
a

woman
she
tried
to
console
me
in
her
pious
way
oh
it
was
very
beautiful
of
coursebride
of
heaven
and
the
rest
of
it
but
i
had
rather
seen
her
the
bride
of
a
nice
young
man
many
is
the
time
i
have
wished
i
had
not
been
so
hasty
about
that
poor
young
smith
i
dont
believe
he
was
purely
smith
after
all
he
must
have
had
some
good
blood
in
his
veins
oh
of
course
of
course
he
was
dreadfully
wicked
i
know
but
he
was
a
fine
fellow
and
all
these
complications
would
have
been
avoided
but
after
all
it
was
ruperts
fault
if
everything
ended
in
tragedy

it
was
on
the
fifth
day
after
sir
adrians
return
to
his
island
home
outwardly
the
place
was
the
same
a
man
had
been
engaged
to
attend
to
the
lighthouse
duties
but
he
and
his
wife
lived
apart
in
their
own
corner
of
the
building
and
never
intruded
into
the
masters
apartments
or
into
the
turretroom
which
had
been
captain
jacks
from
the
moment
that
sir
adrian
attended
by
ren
had
reentered
the
old
rooms
the
peel
had
resumed
its
wonted
aspect
but
the
peace
the
serenity
which
belonged
to
it
for
so
many
years
had
fledfled
it
seemed
to
sir
adrian
for
ever
still
there
was
solitude
and
in
so
far
repose
it
was
something
to
have
such
a
haven
of
refuge
for
his
bruised
spirit
the
whole
morning
of
this
day
had
been
spent
in
counting
out
and
securing
in
separate
lots
duly
docketted
and
distinguished
a
portion
of
that
unwieldy
accumulation
of
wealth
the
charge
of
which
he
had
accepted
against
the
time
when
it
should
be
called
for
and
claimed
by
its
depositors
the
task
was
by
no
means
simple
and
required
all
his
attention
but
there
is
a
blessing
even
in
mere
mechanical
labour
that
soothes
the
torment
of
the
mind
in
the
particular
occupation
upon
which
he
had
been
engaged
there
was
moreover
a
hidden
touching
element
it
was
work
for
the
helpless
dead
work
for
that
erring
man
but
noble
soul
who
had
been
his
loyal
friend
as
sir
adrian
tied
up
each
bag
of
gold
and
labelled
it
with
the
name
of
some
unknown
creditor
who
had
trusted
jack
dimly
the
thought
occurred
that
it
would
stand
material
proof
call
for
recognition
that
this
captain
smith
who
had
died
the
death
of
a
felon
had
been
a
true
man
even
in
his
own
chosen
lawless
path
on
the
table
amid
the
papers
and
books
a
heap
of
gold
pieces
yet
untold
remainder
of
his
allotted
days
task
awaited
still
his
ministering
hand
but
he
was
tired
it
was
the
dreamy
hour
of
the
day
when
the
shadows
grow
long
the
shafts
of
light
level
and
sir
adrian
sat
at
his
open
window
gazing
at
the
distant
view
of
pulwick
while
his
thoughts
wandered
into
the
future
immediate
and
distant
with
the
selfdetachment
of
his
nature
these
thoughts
all
bore
upon
the
future
of
the
woman
whom
he
pictured
to
himself
lying
behind
those
sunlit
windows
yonder
framed
by
the
verdure
of
leafy
june
gathering
slowly
back
her
broken
strength
for
the
long
life
stretching
before
her
unlike
the
musings
which
in
the
lonely
days
of
old
had
ever
drifted
irresistibly
towards
the
past
and
gathered
round
the
image
of
the
dead
all
the
power
of
his
mind
was
now
fixed
upon
what
was
to
come
upon
the
child
still
dearer
than
the
mother
who
had
all
her
life
to
live
what
would
she
do
what
could
he
do
for
her
now
that
she
required
his
helping
hand
no
more
life
was
full
of
sorrow
past
and
present
and
in
the
future
there
lurked
no
promise
of
better
things
the
mind
of
man
is
always
fain
even
in
its
darkest
hour
to
take
flight
into
some
distant
realm
of
hope
to
those
whom
life
has
utterly
betrayed
there
is
always
the
hope
of
approaching
deathbut
this
even
reason
denied
to
him
he
was
so
strong
illness
had
never
taken
hold
of
him
he
came
from
such
longlived
stock
he
might
almost
outlive
her
might
for
ever
stand
as
the
one
ineluctable
check
upon
her
peace
of
mind
and
his
melancholy
reflections
came
circling
back
to
their
first
startingpointthat
barren
rock
of
misery
in
a
vast
sea
of
despondencythere
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
barriers
raised
between
them
on
his
side
partly
by
the
poisonous
words
of
his
brother
partly
by
the
phantom
of
that
old
love
of
which
the
new
had
at
first
been
but
an
eluding
reflex
and
on
hers
by
the
chilly
disillusion
which
had
fallen
so
soon
upon
her
ardent
nature
these
sank
into
insignificance
contrasted
to
the
whirl
of
baulked
passion
which
had
passed
over
her
life
to
leave
it
utterly
blasted
to
turn
her
indifference
to
hate
yes
that
was
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
she
hated
and
dreaded
him
his
love
his
forbearance
his
chivalrousness
had
been
in
vain
all
he
had
now
to
live
upon
was
the
memory
of
those
few
days
when
under
the
spell
of
oblivion
the
beloved
child
had
smiled
on
him
in
the
unconscious
love
born
of
her
helplessness
and
his
care
but
even
this
most
precious
remembrance
of
the
present
was
now
like
that
of
the
past
to
be
obscured
by
its
abrupt
and
terrible
end
death
had
given
birth
to
the
first
and
last
avowal
of
love
in
her
who
had
perished
between
his
arms
under
the
swirling
waters
of
the
vilainebut
it
was
life
itself
returning
life
and
health
of
mind
which
had
changed
looks
of
trust
and
affection
into
the
chilly
stare
of
dread
in
the
eyes
of
her
whom
with
all
the
strength
of
his
hoarded
manhood
he
now
loved
alone
the
past
for
all
its
sorrows
had
held
sweetness
the
present
the
future
nothing
but
torment
and
now
even
the
past
with
its
love
and
its
sorrow
was
gone
from
him
merged
in
the
greater
love
and
sorrow
of
the
present
how
long
could
he
bear
ituseless
clamour
of
the
soul
he
must
bear
it
life
must
be
accepted
sir
adrian
rose
and
standing
paused
a
moment
to
let
his
sight
wandering
beyond
the
immense
sands
seek
repose
for
a
moment
in
the
blue
haze
marking
the
horizon
of
the
hills
the
day
was
pure
exquisite
in
its
waning
beauty
the
breeze
as
light
and
soft
as
a
caress
in
the
great
stillness
of
the
bay
the
sisters
sea
and
land
talked
in
gentle
intermittent
murmurs
now
and
then
the
cries
of
circling
seafowl
brought
a
note
of
uncanny
joy
into
the
harmony
that
seemed
like
silence
in
its
unity
a
beautiful
harmonious
world
but
to
him
the
very
sense
of
the
outer
peace
gave
a
fresh
emphasis
to
the
discordance
of
his
own
life
he
brought
his
gaze
from
afar
and
slowly
turned
to
resume
his
work
but
even
as
he
turned
a
black
speck
upon
the
nearer
arm
of
sea
challenged
his
fleeting
attention
he
stood
and
watchedand
as
he
watched
a
sensation
the
most
poignant
and
yet
eerie
he
had
ever
known
clutched
him
by
the
heart
a
boat
was
approaching
a
small
rowboat
in
which
the
oars
were
plyed
by
a
woman
by
the
multicoloured
glaring
shawl
poor
jacks
appreciated
gift
he
knew
her
but
without
attaching
name
or
personality
to
his
recognition
for
all
his
being
was
drawn
to
the
something
that
lay
huddled
black
and
motionless
in
the
stern
he
felt
to
the
innermost
fibre
of
him
that
this
something
was
a
woman
toothis
woman
molly
but
the
conviction
seized
him
with
a
force
that
was
beyond
surprise
and
all
the
vital
heat
in
him
fled
to
his
heart
leaving
him
deadly
cold
as
her
face
grew
out
of
the
distance
towards
him
a
minute
white
patch
amid
the
dark
cloud
of
silk
and
lace
that
enwrapt
it
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
known
for
centuries
that
she
was
thus
to
come
to
him
and
the
glow
of
his
heart
spread
to
his
brain
when
the
boat
was
about
to
land
he
began
like
one
walking
in
his
sleep
to
move
away
and
slowly
descending
the
stairs
of
the
keep
he
advanced
towards
the
margin
of
the
sea
he
walked
slowly
for
the
body
was
heavy
whilst
the
soul
trembled
within
its
earthly
bounds
molly
had
alighted
and
was
toiling
with
her
new
born
and
yet
but
feeble
strength
upon
the
yielding
sand
supported
between
ren
and
moggie
she
halted
as
she
saw
him
approach
and
when
he
came
close
looked
up
into
his
face
her
frail
figure
wavered
and
bent
and
she
would
have
fallen
on
her
knees
before
him
but
that
he
opened
his
arms
wide
and
caught
her
to
him
an
exclamation
rose
to
moggies
lips
to
die
unformed
under
an
imperious
glance
from
ren
who
with
shining
eyes
and
set
mouth
had
stood
apart
to
watch
the
momentous
issue
adrian
felt
his
wife
nestle
to
him
as
he
held
her
and
then
the
tide
of
his
longbound
love
overflowed
and
gathering
her
up
in
his
arms
as
if
she
were
a
child
he

to
carry
the
broken
woman
with
him
into
the
shelter
the
silence
of
the
ruins
at
the
foot
of
the
outer
wall
just
out
of
reach
of
high
water
yet
within
reach
of
its
salt
spray
a
little
mound
of
red
stony
soil
rose
very
slightly
above
the
green
turf
at
its
head
a
small
stone
cross
roughly
hewn
was
let
into
the
masonry
itself
the
grave
of
hubert
cochrane
was
not
obtrusive
in
a
few
months
it
would
have
merged
again
into
the
greensward
and
its
humble
memorial
symbol
would
be
covered
with
moss
and
lichen
like
the
matrix
of
stone
which
encompassed
it
involuntarily
as
he
passed
it
the
man
with
his
all
too
light
burden
halted
a
flame
shot
through
him
as
molly
turned
her
head
to
gaze
too
he
shook
with
a
brief
agony
of
jealousyjealousy
of
the
dead
the
next
instant
he
felt
her
recoil
look
up
pleadingly
and
cling
to
him
again
and
he
knew
into
the
soul
of
his
soul
that
the
words
spoken
by
those
loyal
lipsnow
clay
beneath
that
claywere
coming
true
that
out
of
his
house
laid
desolate
to
him
was
to
rise
a
new
and
stately
mansion
grasping
her
closer
he
hurried
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
old
room
where
he
had
first
seen
her
bright
young
beauty
at
the
door
he
gently
suffered
her
to
stand
still
supporting
her
with
one
arm
about
her
waist
as
they
entered
she
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
her
eyes
bedewed
with
rising
tears
fell
upon
the
heap
of
gold
glinting
under
the
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
and
she
understood
the
nature
of
the
task
her
coming
had
interrupted
her
tears
gushed
forth
catching
his
hand
between
hers
and
looking
up
at
him
with
a
strange
wonderful
humility
she
pressed
it
to
her
lips
what
need
for
words
between
them
then
he
stood
a
little
while
motionless
in
front
of
her
entranced
yet
still
almost
incredulous
as
one
suddenly
freed
from
long
intolerable
pain
when
there
rose
once
more
for
the
last
time
before
his
minds
eye
the
ideal
image
that
had
been
the
companion
of
twenty
years
of
his
existence
it
was
vivid
almost
as
life
he
saw
ccile
de
savenaye
bend
over
her
child
with
grave
and
tender
look
then
turn
and
smile
upon
him
with
the
old
exquisite
sweetness
that
he
had
adored
so
madly
in
that
far
off
past
and
then
it
was
as
if
she
had
merged
into
molly
behold
she
was
gone
there
was
no
ccile
only
molly
the
woman
he
loved
molly
whom
now
he
seized
to
his
heart
who
smiled
at
him
through
her
tears
as
he
bent
to
kiss
her
lips

involved
with
the

of
both
the

dumases
for
some
time
now
and
since
we
get
a
few
questions
about
the
order
in
which
the
books
should
be
read
and
in
which
they
were
published
these
following
comments
should
hopefully
help
most
of
our
readers

the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
is
the
final
volume
of
dartagnan
romances
it
is
usually
split
into
three
or
four
parts
and
the
final
portion
is
entitled
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
were
familiar
with
today
is
the
last
volume
of
the
fourvolume
edition
not
all
the
editions
split
them
in
the
same
manner
hence
some
of
the
confusionbut
waittheres
yet
more
reason
for
confusion
we
intend
to
do
all
of
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
split
into
four
etexts
entitled
the
vicomte

bragelonne
ten
years
later
louise
de
la
valliere
and
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
one
thing
that
may
be
causing
confusion
is
that
the
etext
we
have
now
entitled
ten
years
later
says
its
the
sequel
to
the
three
musketeers
while
this
is
technically
true
theres
another
book
twenty
years
after
that
comes
between
the
confusion
is
generated
by
the
two
facts
that
we
published
ten
years
later
before
we
published
twenty
years
after
and
that
many
people
see
those
titles
as
meaning
ten
and
twenty
years
after
the
original
storyhowever
this
is
why
the
different
words
after
and
laterthe
ten
years
after
is
ten
years
after
the
twenty
years
lateras
per
history
also
the
third
book
of
the
dartagnan
romances
while
entitled
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
has
the
subtitle
ten
years
later
these
two
titles
are
also
given
to
different
volumes
the
vicomte

i
the
prisoner
since
aramiss
singular
transformation
into
a
confessor
of
the
order
baisemeaux
was
no
longer
the
same
man
up
to
that
period
the
place
which
aramis
had
held
in
the
worthy
governors
estimation
was
that
of
a
prelate
whom
he
respected
and
a
friend
to
whom
he
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
but
now
he
felt
himself
an
inferior
and
that
aramis
was
his
master
he
himself
lighted
a
lantern
summoned
a
turnkey
and
said
returning
to
aramis
i
am
at
your
orders
monseigneur
aramis
merely
nodded
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
very
good
and
signed
to
him
with
his
hand
to
lead
the
way
baisemeaux
advanced
and
aramis
followed
him
it
was
a
calm
and
lovely
starlit
night
the
steps
of
three
men
resounded
on
the
flags
of
the
terraces
and
the
clinking
of
the
keys
hanging
from
the
jailers
girdle
made
itself
heard
up
to
the
stories
of
the
towers
as
if
to
remind
the
prisoners
that
the
liberty
of
earth
was
a
luxury
beyond
their
reach
it
might
have
been
said
that
the
alteration
effected
in
baisemeaux
extended
even
to
the
prisoners
the
turnkey
the
same
who
on
aramiss
first
arrival
had
shown
himself
so
inquisitive
and
curious
was
now
not
only
silent
but
impassible
he
held
his
head
down
and
seemed
afraid
to
keep
his
ears
open
in
this
wise
they
reached
the
basement
of
the
bertaudiere
the
two
first
stories
of
which
were
mounted
silently
and
somewhat
slowly
for
baisemeaux
though
far
from
disobeying
was
far
from
exhibiting
any
eagerness
to
obey
on
arriving
at
the
door
baisemeaux
showed
a
disposition
to
enter
the
prisoners
chamber
but
aramis
stopping
him
on
the
threshold
said
the
rules
do
not
allow
the
governor
to
hear
the
prisoners
confession
baisemeaux
bowed
and
made
way
for
aramis
who
took
the
lantern
and
entered
and
then
signed
to
them
to
close
the
door
behind
him
for
an
instant
he
remained
standing
listening
whether
baisemeaux
and
the
turnkey
had
retired
but
as
soon
as
he
was
assured
by
the
sound
of
their
descending
footsteps
that
they
had
left
the
tower
he
put
the
lantern
on
the
table
and
gazed
around
on
a
bed
of
green
serge
similar
in
all
respect
to
the
other
beds
in
the
bastile
save
that
it
was
newer
and
under
curtains
halfdrawn
reposed
a
young
man
to
whom
we
have
already
once
before
introduced
aramis
according
to
custom
the
prisoner
was
without
a
light
at
the
hour
of
curfew
he
was
bound
to
extinguish
his
lamp
and
we
perceive
how
much
he
was
favored
in
being
allowed
to
keep
it
burning
even
till
then
near

bed

window
while
several
plates
still
unemptied
showed
that
the
prisoner
had
scarcely
touched
his
evening
meal
aramis
saw
that
the
young
man
was
stretched
upon
his
bed
his
face
half
concealed
by
his
arms
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
did
not
caused
any
change
of
position
either
he
was
waiting
in
expectation
or
was
asleep
aramis
lighted
the
candle
from
the
lantern
pushed
back
the
armchair
and
approached
the
bed
with
an
evident
mixture
of
interest
and
respect
the
young
man
raised
his
head
what
is
it
said
he
you
desired
a
confessor
replied
aramis
yes
because
you
were
ill
yes
very
ill
the
young
man
gave
aramis
a
piercing
glance
and
answered
i
thank
you
after
a
moments
silence
i
have
seen
you
before
he
continued
aramis
bowed
doubtless
the
scrutiny
the
prisoner
had
just
made
of
the
cold
crafty
and
imperious
character
stamped
upon
the
features
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
was
little
reassuring
to
one
in
his
situation
for
he
added
i
am
better
and
so
said
aramis
why
thenbeing
better
i
have
no
longer
the
same
need
of
a
confessor
i
think
not
even
of
the
haircloth
which
the
note
you
found
in
your
bread
informed
you
of
the
young
man
started
but
before
he
had
either
assented
or
denied
aramis
continued
not
even
of
the
ecclesiastic
from
whom
you
were
to
hear
an
important
revelation
if
it
be
so
said
the
young
man
sinking
again
on
his
pillow
it
is
different
i
am
listening
aramis
then
looked
at
him
more
closely
and
was
struck
with
the
easy
majesty
of
his
mien
one
which
can
never
be
acquired
unless
heaven
has
implanted
it
in
the
blood
or
heart
sit
down
monsieur
said
the
prisoner
aramis
bowed
and
obeyed
how
does
the
bastile
agree
with
you
asked
the
bishop
very
well
you
do
not
suffer
no
you
have
nothing
to
regret
nothing
not
even
your
liberty
what
do
you
call
liberty
monsieur
asked
the
prisoner
with
the
tone
of
a
man
who
is
preparing
for
a
struggle
i
call
liberty
the
flowers
the
air
light
the
stars
the
happiness
of
going
whithersoever
the
sinewy
limbs
of
oneandtwenty
chance
to
wish
to
carry
you
the
young
man
smiled
whether
in
resignation
or
contempt
it
was
difficult
to
tell
look
said
he
i
have
in
that
japanese
vase
two
roses
gathered
yesterday
evening
in
the
bud
from
the
governors
garden
this
morning
they
have
blown
and
spread
their
vermilion
chalice
beneath
my
gaze
with
every
opening
petal
they
unfold
the
treasures
of
their
perfumes
filling
my
chamber
with
a
fragrance
that
embalms
it
look
now
on
these
two
roses
even
among
roses
these
are
beautiful
and
the
rose
is
the
most
beautiful
of
flowers
why
then
do
you
bid
me
desire
other
flowers
when
i
possess
the
loveliest
of
all
aramis
gazed
at
the
young
man
in
surprise
if
flowers
constitute
liberty
sadly
resumed
the
captive
i
am
free
for
i
possess
them
but
the
air
cried
aramis
air
is
so
necessary
to
life
well
monsieur
returned
the
prisoner
draw
near
to
the
window
it
is
open
between
high
heaven
and
earth
the
wind
whirls
on
its
waftages
of
hail
and
lightning
exhales
its
torrid
mist
or
breathes
in
gentle
breezes
it
caresses
my
face
when
mounted
on
the
back
of
this
armchair
with
my
arm
around
the
bars
of
the
window
to
sustain
myself
i
fancy
i
am
swimming
the
wide
expanse
before
me
the
countenance
of
aramis
darkened
as
the
young
man
continued
light
i
have
what
is
better
than
light
i
have
the
sun
a
friend
who
comes
to
visit
me
every
day
without
the
permission
of
the
governor
or
the
jailers
company
he
comes
in
at
the
window
and
traces
in
my
room
a
square
the
shape
of
the
window
which
lights
up
the
hangings
of
my
bed
and
floods
the
very
floor
this
luminous
square
increases
from
ten
oclock
till
midday
and
decreases
from
one
till
three
slowly
as
if
having
hastened
to
my
presence
it
sorrowed
at
bidding
me
farewell
when
its
last
ray
disappears
i
have
enjoyed
its
presence
for
five
hours
is
not
that
sufficient
i
have
been
told
that
there
are
unhappy
beings
who
dig
in
quarries
and
laborers
who
toil
in
mines
who
never
behold
it
at
all
aramis
wiped
the
drops
from
his
brow
as
to
the
stars
which
are
so
delightful
to
view
continued
the
young
man
they
all
resemble
each
other
save
in
size
and
brilliancy
i
am
a
favored
mortal
for
if
you
had
not
lighted
that
candle
you
would
have
been
able
to
see
the
beautiful
stars
which
i
was
gazing
at
from
my
couch
before
your
arrival
whose
silvery
rays
were
stealing
through
my
brain
aramis
lowered
his
head
he
felt
himself
overwhelmed
with
the
bitter
flow
of
that
sinister
philosophy
which
is
the
religion
of
the
captive
so
much
then
for
the
flowers
the
air
the
daylight
and
the
stars
tranquilly
continued
the
young
man
there
remains
but
exercise
do
i
not
walk
all
day
in
the
governors
garden
if
it
is
finehere
if
it
rains
in
the
fresh
air
if
it
is
warm
in
perfect
warmth
thanks
to
my
winter
stove
if
it
be
cold
ah
monsieur
do
you
fancy
continued
the
prisoner
not
without
bitterness
that
men
have
not
done
everything
for
me
that
a
man
can
hope
for
or
desire
men
said
aramis
be
it
so
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
forgetting
heaven
indeed
i
have
forgotten
heaven
murmured
the
prisoner
with
emotion
but
why
do
you
mention
it
of
what
use
is
it
to
talk
to
a
prisoner
of
heaven
aramis
looked
steadily
at
this
singular
youth
who
possessed
the
resignation
of
a
martyr
with
the
smile
of
an
atheist
is
not
heaven
in
everything
he
murmured
in
a
reproachful
tone
say
rather
at
the
end
of
everything
answered
the
prisoner
firmly
be
it
so
said
aramis
but
let
us
return
to
our
startingpoint
i
ask
nothing
better
returned
the
young
man
i
am
your
confessor
yes
well
then
you
ought
as
a
penitent
to
tell
me
the
truth
my
whole
desire
is
to
tell
it
you
every
prisoner
has
committed
some
crime
for
which
he
has
been
imprisoned
what
crime
then
have
you
committed
you
asked
me
the
same
question
the
first
time
you
saw
me
returned
the
prisoner
and
then
as
now
you
evaded
giving
me
an
answer
and
what
reason
have
you
for
thinking
that
i
shall
now
reply
to
you
because
this
time
i
am
your
confessor
then
if
you
wish
me
to
tell
what
crime
i
have
committed
explain
to
me
in
what
a
crime
consists
for
as
my
conscience
does
not
accuse
me
i
aver
that
i
am
not
a
criminal
we
are
often
criminals
in
the
sight
of
the
great
of
the
earth
not
alone
for
having
ourselves
committed
crimes
but
because
we
know
that
crimes
have
been
committed
the
prisoner
manifested
the
deepest
attention
yes
i
understand
you
he
said
after
a
pause
yes
you
are
right
monsieur
it
is
very
possible
that
in
such
a
light
i
am
a
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
great
of
the
earth
ah
then
you
know
something
said
aramis
who
thought
he
had
pierced
not
merely
through
a
defect
in
the
harness
but
through
the
joints
of
it
no
i
am
not
aware
of
anything
replied
the
young
man
but
sometimes
i
thinkand
i
say
to
myself
what
do
you
say
to
yourself
that
if
i
were
to
think
but
a
little
more
deeply
i
should
either
go
mad
or
i
should
divine
a
great
deal
and
thenand
then
said
aramis
impatiently
then
i
leave
off
you
leave
off
yes
my
head
becomes
confused
and
my
ideas
melancholy
i
feel
ennui
overtaking
me
i
wish
what
i
dont
know
but
i
do
not
like
to
give
myself
up
to
longing
for
things
which
i
do
not
possess
when
i
am
so
happy
with
what
i
have
you
are
afraid
of
death
said
aramis
with
a
slight
uneasiness
yes
said
the
young
man
smiling
aramis
felt
the
chill
of
that
smile
and
shuddered
oh
as
you
fear
death
you
know
more
about
matters
than
you
say
he
cried
and
you
returned
the
prisoner
who
bade
me
to
ask
to
see
you
you
who
when
i
did
ask
to
see
you
came
here
promising
a
world
of
confidence
how
is
it
that
nevertheless
it
is
you
who
are
silent
leaving
it
for
me
to
speak
since
then
we
both
wear
masks
either
let
us
both
retain
them
or
put
them
aside
together
aramis
felt
the
force
and
justice
of
the
remark
saying
to
himself
this
is
no
ordinary
man
i
must
be
cautiousare
you
ambitious
said
he
suddenly
to
the
prisoner
aloud
without
preparing
him
for
the
alteration
what
do
you
mean
by
ambitious
replied
the
youth
ambition
replied
aramis
is
the
feeling
which
prompts
a
man
to
desire
moremuch
morethan
he
possesses
i
said
that
i
was
contented
monsieur
but
perhaps
i
deceive
myself
i
am
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
ambition
but
it
is
not
impossible
i
may
have
some
tell
me
your
mind
that
is
all
i
ask
an
ambitious
man
said
aramis
is
one
who
covets
that
which
is
beyond
his
station
i
covet
nothing
beyond
my
station
said
the
young
man
with
an
assurance
of
manner
which
for
the
second
time
made
the
bishop
of
vannes
tremble
he
was
silent
but
to
look
at
the
kindling
eye
the
knitted
brow
and
the
reflective
attitude
of
the
captive
it
was
evident
that
he
expected
something
more
than
silencea
silence
which
aramis
now
broke
you
lied
the
first
time
i
saw
you
said
he
lied
cried
the
young
man
starting
up
on
his
couch
with
such
a
tone
in
his
voice
and
such
a
lightning
in
his
eyes
that
aramis
recoiled
in
spite
of
himself
i
should
say
returned
aramis
bowing
you
concealed
from
me
what
you
knew
of
your
infancy
a
mans
secrets
are
his
own
monsieur
retorted
the
prisoner
and
not
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
chancecomer
true
said
aramis
bowing
still
lower
than
before
tis
true
pardon
me
but
today
do
i
still
occupy
the
place
of
a
chancecomer
i
beseech
you
to
reply
monseigneur
this
title
slightly
disturbed
the
prisoner
but
nevertheless
he
did
not
appear
astonished
that
it
was
given
him
i
do
not
know
you
monsieur
said
he
oh
but
if
i
dared
i
would
take
your
hand
and
kiss
it
the
young
man
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
to
give
aramis
his
hand
but
the
light
which
beamed
in
his
eyes
faded
away
and
he
coldly
and
distrustfully
withdrew
his
hand
again
kiss
the
hand
of
a
prisoner
he
said
shaking
his
head
to
what
purpose
why
did
you
tell
me
said
aramis
that
you
were
happy
here
why
that
you
aspired
to
nothing
why
in
a
word
by
thus
speaking
do
you
prevent
me
from
being
frank
in
my
turn
the
same
light
shone
a
third
time
in
the
young
mans
eyes
but
died
ineffectually
away
as
before
you
distrust
me
said
aramis
and
why
say
you
so
monsieur
oh
for
a
very
simple
reason
if
you
know
what
you
ought
to
know
you
ought
to
mistrust
everybody
then
do
not
be
astonished
that
i
am
mistrustful
since
you
suspect
me
of
knowing
what
i
do
not
know
aramis
was
struck
with
admiration
at
this
energetic
resistance
oh
monseigneur
you
drive
me
to
despair
said
he
striking
the
armchair
with
his
fist
and
on
my
part
i
do
not
comprehend
you
monsieur
well
then
try
to
understand
me
the
prisoner
looked
fixedly
at
aramis
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
said
the
latter
that
i
have
before
me
the
man
whom
i
seek
and
then
and
then
your
man
disappearsis
it
not
so
said
the
prisoner
smiling
so
much
the
better
aramis
rose
certainly
said
he
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
to
a
man
who
mistrusts
me
as
you
do
and
i
monsieur
said
the
prisoner
in
the
same
tone
have
nothing
to
say
to
a
man
who
will
not
understand
that
a
prisoner
ought
to
be
mistrustful
of
everybody
even
of
his
old
friends
said
aramis
oh
monseigneur
you
are
too
prudent
of
my
old
friendsyou
one
of
my
old
friendsyou
do
you
no
longer
remember
said
aramis
that
you
once
saw
in
the
village
where
your
early
years
were
spent
do
you
know
the
name
of
the
village
asked
the
prisoner
noisylesec
monseigneur
answered
aramis
firmly
go
on
said
the
young
man
with
an
immovable
aspect
stay
monseigneur
said
aramis
if
you
are
positively
resolved
to
carry
on
this
game
let
us
break
off
i
am
here
to
tell
you
many
things
tis
true
but
you
must
allow
me
to
see
that
on
your
side
you
have
a
desire
to
know
them
before
revealing
the
important
matters
i
still
withhold
be
assured
i
am
in
need
of
some
encouragement
if
not
candor
a
little
sympathy
if
not
confidence
but
you
keep
yourself
intrenched
in
a
pretended
which
paralyzes
me
oh
not
for
the
reason
you
think
for
ignorant
as
you
may
be
or
indifferent
as
you
feign
to
be
you
are
none
the
less
what
you
are
monseigneur
and
there
is
nothingnothing
mark
me
which
can
cause
you
not
to
be
so
i
promise
you
replied
the
prisoner
to
hear
you
without
impatience
only
it
appears
to
me
that
i
have
a
right
to
repeat
the
question
i
have
already
asked
who
are
you
do
you
remember
fifteen
or
eighteen
years
ago
seeing
at
noisylesec
a
cavalier
accompanied
by
a
lady
in
black
silk
with
flamecolored
ribbons
in
her
hair
yes
said
the
young
man
i
once
asked
the
name
of
this
cavalier
and
they
told
me
that
he
called
himself
the
abbe
dherblay
i
was
astonished
that
the
abbe
had
so
warlike
an
air
and
they
replied
that
there
was
nothing
singular
in
that
seeing
that
he
was
one
of
louis
xiiis
musketeers
well
said
aramis
that
musketeer
and
abbe
afterwards
bishop
of
vannes
is
your
confessor
now
i
know
it
i
recognized
you
then
monseigneur
if
you
know
that
i
must
further
add
a
fact
of
which
you
are
ignorantthat
if
the
king
were
to
know
this
evening
of
the
presence
of
this
musketeer
this
abbe
this
bishop
this
confessor
herehe
who
has
risked
everything
to
visit
you
tomorrow
would
behold
the
steely
glitter
of
the
executioners
axe
in
a
dungeon
more
gloomy
more
obscure
than
yours
while
listening
to
these
words
delivered
with
emphasis
the
young
man
had
raised
himself
on
his
couch
and
was
now
gazing
more
and
more
eagerly
at
aramis
the
result
of
his
scrutiny
was
that
he
appeared
to
derive
some
confidence
from
it
yes
he
murmured
i
remember
perfectly
the
woman
of
whom
you
speak
came
once
with
you
and
twice
afterwards
with
another
he
hesitated
with
another
who
came
to
see
you
every
monthis
it
not
so
monseigneur
yes
do
you
know
who
this
lady
was
the
light
seemed
ready
to
flash
from
the
prisoners
eyes
i
am
aware
that
she
was
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
he
said
you
remember
that
lady
well
do
you
not
oh
my
recollection
can
hardly
be
very
confused
on
this
head
said
the
young
prisoner
i
saw
that
lady
once
with
a
gentleman
about
fortyfive
years
old
i
saw
her
once
with
you
and
with
the
lady
dressed
in
black
i
have
seen
her
twice
since
then
with
the
same
person
these
four
people
with
my
master
and
old
perronnette
my
jailer
and
the
governor
of
the
prison
are
the
only
persons
with
whom
i
have
ever
spoken
and
indeed
almost
the
only
persons
i
have
ever
seen
then
you
were
in
prison
if
i
am
a
prisoner
here
then
i
was
comparatively
free
although
in
a
very
narrow
sensea
house
i
never
quitted
a
garden
surrounded
with
walls
i
could
not
climb
these
constituted
my
residence
but
you
know
it
as
you
have
been
there
in
a
word
being
accustomed
to
live
within
these
bounds
i
never
cared
to
leave
them
and
so
you
will
understand
monsieur
that
having
never
seen
anything
of
the
world
i
have
nothing
left
to
care
for
and
therefore
if
you
relate
anything
you
will
be
obliged
to
explain
each
item
to
me
as
you
go
along
and
i
will
do
so
said
aramis
bowing
for
it
is
my
duty
monseigneur
well
then
begin
by
telling
me
who
was
my
tutor
a
worthy
and
above
all
an
honorable
gentleman
monseigneur
fit
guide
for
both
body
and
soul
had
you
ever
any
reason
to
complain
of
him
oh
no
quite
the
contrary
but
this
gentleman
of
yours
often
used
to
tell
me
that
my
father
and
mother
were
dead
did
he
deceive
me
or
did
he
speak
the
truth
he
was
compelled
to
comply
with
the
orders
given
him
then
he
lied
in
one
respect
your
father
is
dead
and
my
mother
she
is
dead
for
you
but
then
she
lives
for
others
does
she
not
yes
and
iand
i
then
the
young
man
looked
sharply
at
aramis
am
compelled
to
live
in
the
obscurity
of
a
prison
alas
i
fear
so
and
that
because
my
presence
in
the
world
would
lead
to
the
revelation
of
a
great
secret
certainly
a
very
great
secret
my
enemy
must
indeed
be
powerful
to
be
able
to
shut
up
in
the
bastile
a
child
such
as
i
then
was
he
is
more
powerful
than
my
mother
then
and
why
do
you
ask
that
because
my
mother
would
have
taken
my
part
aramis
hesitated
yes
monseigneur
more
powerful
than
your
mother
seeing
then
that
my
nurse
and
preceptor
were
carried
off
and
that
i
also
was
separated
from
themeither
they
were
or
i
am
very
dangerous
to
my
enemy
yes
but
you
are
alluding
to
a
peril
from
which
he
freed
himself
by
causing
the
nurse
and
preceptor
to
disappear
answered
aramis
quietly
disappear
cried
the
prisoner
how
did
they
disappear
in
a
very
sure
way
answered
aramisthey
are
dead
the
young
man
turned
pale
and
passed
his
hand
tremblingly
over
his
face
poison
he
asked
poison
the
prisoner
reflected
a
moment
my
enemy
must
indeed
have
been
very
cruel
or
hard
beset
by
necessity
to
assassinate
those
two
innocent
people
my
sole
support
for
the
worthy
gentleman
and
the
poor
nurse
had
never
harmed
a
living
being
in
your
family
monseigneur
necessity
is
stern
and
so
it
is
necessity
which
compels
me
to
my
great
regret
to
tell
you
that
this
gentleman
and
the
unhappy
lady
have
been
assassinated
oh
you
tell
me
nothing
i
am
not
aware
of
said
the
prisoner
knitting
his
brows
how
i
suspected
it
why
i
will
tell
you
at
this
moment
the
young
man
supporting
himself
on
his
two
elbows
drew
close
to
aramiss
face
with
such
an
expression
of
dignity
of
selfcommand
and
of
defiance
even
that
the
bishop
felt
the
electricity
of
enthusiasm
strike
in
devouring
flashes
from
that
great
heart
of
his
into
his
brain
of
adamant
speak
monseigneur
i
have
already
told
you
that
by
conversing
with
you
i
endanger
my
life
little
value
as
it
has
i
implore
you
to
accept
it
as
the
ransom
of
your
own
well
resumed
the
young
man
this
is
why
i
suspected
they
had
killed
my
nurse
and
my
preceptor
whom
you
used
to
call
your
father
yes
whom
i
called
my
father
but
whose
son
i
well
knew
i
was
not
who
caused
you
to
suppose
so
just
as
you
monsieur
are
too
respectful
for
a
friend
he
was
also
too
respectful
for
a
father
i
however
said
aramis
have
no
intention
to
disguise
myself
the
young
man
nodded
assent
and
continued
undoubtedly
i
was
not
destined
to
perpetual
seclusion
said
the
prisoner
and
that
which
makes
me
believe
so
above
all
now
is
the
care
that
was
taken
to
render
me
as
accomplished
a
cavalier
as
possible
the
gentleman
attached
to
my
person
taught
me
everything
he
knew
himselfmathematics
a
little
geometry
astronomy
fencing
and
riding
every
morning
i
went
through
military
exercises
and
practiced
on
horseback
well
one
morning
during
the
summer
it
being
very
hot
i
went
to
sleep
in
the
hall
nothing
up
to
that
period
except
the
respect
paid
me
had
enlightened
me
or
even
roused
my
suspicions
i
lived
as
children
as
birds
as
plants
as
the
air
and
the
sun
do
i
had
just
turned
my
fifteenth
year
this
then
is
eight
years
ago
yes
nearly
but
i
have
ceased
to
reckon
time
excuse
me
but
what
did
your
tutor
tell
you
to
encourage
you
to
work
he
used
to
say
that
a
man
was
bound
to
make
for
himself
in
the
world
that
fortune
which
heaven
had
refused
him
at
his
birth
he
added
that
being
a
poor
obscure
orphan
i
had
no
one
but
myself
to
look
to
and
that
nobody
either
did
or
ever
would
take
any
interest
in
me
i
was
then
in
the
hall
i
have
spoken
of
asleep
from
fatigue
with
long
fencing
my
preceptor
was
in
his
room
on
the
first
floor
just
over
me
suddenly
i
heard
him
exclaim
and
then
he
called
perronnette
perronnette
it
was
my
nurse
whom
he
called
yes
i
know
it
said
aramis
continue
monseigneur
very
likely
she
was
in
the
garden
for
my
preceptor
came
hastily
downstairs
i
rose
anxious
at
seeing
him
anxious
he
opened
the
gardendoor
still
crying
out
perronnette
perronnette
the
windows
of
the
hall
looked
into
the
court
the
shutters
were
closed
but
through
a
chink
in
them
i
saw
my
tutor
draw
near
a
large
well
which
was
almost
directly
under
the
windows
of
his
study
he
stooped
over
the
brim
looked
into
the
well
and
again
cried
out
and
made
wild
and
affrighted
gestures
where
i
was
i
could
not
only
see
but
hearand
see
and
hear
i
did
go
on
i
pray
you
said
aramis
dame
perronnette
came
running
up
hearing
the
governors
cries
he
went
to
meet
her
took
her
by
the
arm
and
drew
her
quickly
towards
the
edge
after
which
as
they
both
bent
over
it
together
look
look
cried
he
what
a
misfortune
calm
yourself
calm
yourself
said
perronnette
what
is
the
matter
the
letter
he
exclaimed
do
you
see
that
letter
pointing
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
what
letter
she
cried
the
letter
you
see
down
there
the
last
letter
from
the
queen
at
this
word
i
trembled
my
tutorhe
who
passed
for
my
father
he
who
was
continually
recommending
me
modesty
and
humilityin
correspondence
with
the
queen
the
queens
last
letter
cried
perronnette
without
showing
more
astonishment
than
at
seeing
this
letter
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
but
how
came
it
there
a
chance
dame
perronnettea
singular
chance
i
was
entering
my
room
and
on
opening
the
door
the
window
too
being
open
a
puff
of
air
came
suddenly
and
carried
off
this
paperthis
letter
of
her
majestys
i
darted
after
it
and
gained
the
window
just
in
time
to
see
it
flutter
a
moment
in
the
breeze
and
disappear
down
the
well
well
said
dame
perronnette
and
if
the
letter
has
fallen
into
the
well
tis
all
the
same
as
if
it
was
burnt
and
as
the
queen
burns
all
her
letters
every
time
she
comes
and
so
you
see
this
lady
who
came
every
month
was
the
queen
said
the
prisoner
doubtless
doubtless
continued
the
old
gentleman
but
this
letter
contained
instructionshow
can
i
follow
them
write
immediately
to
her
give
her
a
plain
account
of
the
accident
and
the
queen
will
no
doubt
write
you
another
letter
in
place
of
this
oh
the
queen
would
never
believe
the
story
said
the
good
gentleman
shaking
his
head
she
will
imagine
that
i
want
to
keep
this
letter
instead
of
giving
it
up
like
the
rest
so
as
to
have
a
hold
over
her
she
is
so
distrustful
and
m
de
mazarin
soyon
devil
of
an
italian

capable
of
having

poisoned
at
the
first
breath
of
suspicion
aramis
almost
imperceptibly
smiled
you
know
dame
perronnette
they
are
both
so
suspicious
in
all
that
concerns
philippe
philippe
was
the
name
they
gave
me
said
the
prisoner
well
tis
no
use
hesitating
said
dame
perronnette
somebody
must
go
down
the
well
of
course
so
that
the
person
who
goes
down
may
read
the
paper
as
he
is
coming
up
but
let
us
choose
some
villager
who
cannot
read
and
then
you
will
be
at
ease
granted
but
will
not
any
one
who
descends
guess
that
a
paper
must
be
important
for
which
we
risk
a
mans
life
however
you
have
given
me
an
idea
dame
perronnette
somebody
shall
go
down
the
well
but
that
somebody
shall
be
myself
but
at
this
notion
dame
perronnette
lamented
and
cried
in
such
a
manner
and
so
implored
the
old
nobleman
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
he
promised
her
to
obtain
a
ladder
long
enough
to
reach
down
while
she
went
in
search
of
some
stouthearted
youth
whom
she
was
to
persuade
that
a
jewel
had
fallen
into
the
well
and
that
this
jewel
was
wrapped
in
a
paper
and
as
paper
remarked
my
preceptor
naturally
unfolds
in
water
the
young
man
would
not
be
surprised
at
finding
nothing
after
all
but
the
letter
wide
open
but
perhaps
the
writing
will
be
already
effaced
by
that
time
said
dame
perronnette
no
consequence
provided
we
secure
the
letter
on
returning
it
to
the
queen
she
will
see
at
once
that
we
have
not
betrayed
her
and
consequently
as
we
shall
not
rouse
the
distrust
of
mazarin
we
shall
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
having
come
to
this
resolution
they
parted
i
pushed
back
the
shutter
and
seeing
that
my
tutor
was
about
to
reenter
i
threw
myself
on
my
couch
in
a
confusion
of
brain
caused
by
all
i
had
just
heard
my
governor
opened
the
door
a
few
moments
after
and
thinking
i
was
asleep
gently
closed
it
again
as
soon
as
ever
it
was
shut
i
rose
and
listening
heard
the
sound
of
retiring
footsteps
then
i
returned
to
the
shutters
and
saw
my
tutor
and
dame
perronnette
go
out
together
i
was
alone
in
the
house
they
had
hardly
closed
the
gate
before
i
sprang
from
the
window
and
ran
to
the
well
then
just
as
my
governor
had
leaned
over
so
leaned
i
something
white
and
luminous
glistened
in
the
green
and
quivering
silence
of
the
water
the
brilliant
disk
fascinated
and
allured
me
my
eyes
became
fixed
and
i
could
hardly
breathe
the
well
seemed
to
draw
me
downwards
with
its
slimy
mouth
and
icy
breath
and
i
thought
i
read
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
characters
of
fire
traced
upon
the
letter
the
queen
had
touched
then
scarcely
knowing
what
i
was
about
and
urged
on
by
one
of
those
instinctive
impulses
which
drive
men
to
destruction
i
lowered
the
cord
from
the
windlass
of
the
well
to
within
about
three
feet
of
the
water
leaving
the
bucket
dangling
at
the
same
time
taking
infinite
pains
not
to
disturb
that
coveted
letter
which
was
beginning
to
change
its
white
tint
for
the
hue
of
chrysopraseproof
enough
that
it
was
sinkingand
then
with
the
rope
weltering
in
my
hands
slid
down
into
the
abyss
when
i
saw
myself
hanging
over
the
dark
pool
when
i
saw
the
sky
lessening
above
my
head
a
cold
shudder
came
over
me
a
chill
fear
got
the
better
of
me
i
was
seized
with
giddiness
and
the
hair
rose
on
my
head
but
my
strong
will
still
reigned
supreme
over
all
the
terror
and
disquietude
i
gained
the
water
and
at
once
plunged
into
it
holding
on
by
one
hand
while
i
immersed
the
other
and
seized
the
dear
letter
which
alas
came
in
two
in
my
grasp
i
concealed
the
two
fragments
in
my
bodycoat
and
helping
myself
with
my
feet
against
the
sides
of
the
pit
and
clinging
on
with
my
hands
agile
and
vigorous
as
i
was
and
above
all
pressed
for
time
i
regained
the
brink
drenching
it
as
i
touched
it
with
the
water
that
streamed
off
me
i
was
no
sooner
out
of
the
well
with
my
prize
than
i
rushed
into
the
sunlight
and
took
refuge
in
a
kind
of
shrubbery
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
as
i
entered
my
hidingplace
the
bell
which
resounded
when
the
great
gate
was
opened
rang
it
was
my
preceptor
come
back
again
i
had
but
just
time
i
calculated
that
it
would
take
ten
minutes
before
he
would
gain
my
place
of
concealment
even
if
guessing
where
i
was
he
came
straight
to
it
and
twenty
if
he
were
obliged
to
look
for
me
but
this
was
time
enough
to
allow
me
to
read
the
cherished
letter
whose
fragments
i
hastened
to
unite
again
the
writing
was
already
fading
but
i
managed
to
decipher
it
all
and
will
you
tell
me
what
you
read
therein
monseigneur
asked
aramis
deeply
interested
quite
enough
monsieur
to
see
that
my
tutor
was
a
man
of
noble
rank
and
that
perronnette
without
being
a
lady
of
quality
was
far
better
than
a
servant
and
also
to
perceived
that
i
must
myself
be
highborn
since
the
queen
anne
of
austria
and
mazarin
the
prime
minister
commended
me
so
earnestly
to
their
care
here
the
young
man
paused
quite
overcome
and
what
happened
asked
aramis
it
happened
monsieur
answered
he
that
the
workmen
they
had
summoned
found
nothing
in
the
well
after
the
closest
search
that
my
governor
perceived
that
the
brink
was
all
watery
that
i
was
not
so
dried
by
the
sun
as
to
prevent
dame
perronnette
spying
that
my
garments
were
moist
and
lastly
that
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
fever
owing
to
the
chill
and
the
excitement
of
my
discovery
an
attack
of
delirium
supervening
during
which
i
related
the
whole
adventure
so
that
guided
by
my
avowal
my
governor
found
the
pieces
of
the
queens
letter
inside
the
bolster
where
i
had
concealed
them
ah
said
aramis
now
i
understand
beyond
this
all
is
conjecture
doubtless
the
unfortunate
lady
and
gentleman
not
daring
to
keep
the
occurrence
secret
wrote
of
all
this
to
the
queen
and
sent
back
the
torn
letter
after
which
said
aramis
you
were
arrested
and
removed
to
the
bastile
as
you
see
your
two
attendants
disappeared
alas
let
us
not
take
up
our
time
with
the
dead
but
see
what
can
be
done
with
the
living
you
told
me
you
were
resigned
i
repeat
it
without
any
desire
for
freedom
as
i
told
you
without
ambition
sorrow
or
thought
the
young
man
made
no
answer
well
asked
aramis
why
are
you
silent
i
think
i
have
spoken
enough
answered
the
prisoner
and
that
now
it
is
your
turn
i
am
weary
aramis
gathered
himself
up
and
a
shade
of
deep
solemnity
spread
itself
over
his
countenance
it
was
evident
that
he
had
reached
the
crisis
in
the
part
he
had
come
to
the
prison
to
play
one
question
said
aramis
what
is
it
speak
in
the
house
you
inhabited
there
were
neither
lookingglasses
nor
mirrors
what
are
those
two
words
and
what
is
their
meaning
asked
the
young
man
i
have
no
sort
of
knowledge
of
them
they
designate
two
pieces
of
furniture
which
reflect
objects
so
that
for
instance
you
may
see
in
them
your
own
lineaments
as
you
see
mine
now
with
the
naked
eye
no
there
was
neither
a
glass
nor
a
mirror
in
the
house
answered
the
young
man
aramis
looked
round
him
nor
is
there
anything
of
the
kind
here
either
he
said
they
have
again
taken
the
same
precaution
to
what
end
you
will
know
directly
now
you
have
told
me
that
you
were
instructed
in
mathematics
astronomy
fencing
and
riding
but
you
have
not
said
a
word
about
history
my
tutor
sometimes
related
to
me
the
principal
deeds
of
the
king
st
louis
king
francis
i
and
king
henry
iv
is
that
all
very
nearly
this
also
was
done
by
design
then
just
as
they
deprived
you
of
mirrors
which
reflect
the
present
so
they
left
you
in
ignorance
of
history
which
reflects
the
past
since
your
imprisonment
books
have
been
forbidden
you
so
that
you
are
unacquainted
with
a
number
of
facts
by
means
of
which
you
would
be
able
to
reconstruct
the
shattered
mansion
of
your
recollections
and
your
hopes
it
is
true
said
the
young
man
listen
then
i
will
in
a
few
words
tell
you
what
has
passed
in
france
during
the
last
twentythree
or
twentyfour
years
that
is
from
the
probable
date
of
your
birth
in
a
word
from
the
time
that
interests
you
say
on
and
the
young
man
resumed
his
serious
and
attentive
attitude
do
you
know
who
was
the
son
of
henry
iv
at
least
i
know
who
his
successor
was
how
by
means
of
a
coin
dated
1610
which
bears
the
effigy
of
henry
iv
and
another
of
1612
bearing
that
of
louis
xiii
so
i
presumed
that
there
being
only
two
years
between
the
two
dates
louis
was
henrys
successor
then
said
aramis
you
know
that
the
last
reigning
monarch
was
louis
xiii
i
do
answered
the
youth
slightly
reddening
well
he
was
a
prince
full
of
noble
ideas
and
great
projects
always
alas
deferred
by
the
trouble
of
the
times
and
the
dread
struggle
that
his
minister
richelieu
had
to
maintain
against
the
great
nobles
of
france
the
king
himself
was
of
a
feeble
character
and
died
young
and
unhappy
i
know
it
he
had
been
long
anxious
about
having
a
heir
a
care
which
weighs
heavily
on
princes
who
desire
to
leave
behind
them
more
than
one
pledge
that
their
best
thoughts
and
works
will
be
continued
did
the
king
then
die
childless
asked
the
prisoner
smiling
no
but
he
was
long
without
one
and
for
a
long
while
thought
he
should
be
the
last
of
his
race
this
idea
had
reduced
him
to
the
depths
of
despair
when
suddenly
his
wife
anne
of
austria
the
prisoner
trembled
did
you
know
said
aramis
that
louis
xiiis
wife
was
called
anne
of
austria
continue
said
the
young
man
without
replying
to
the
question
when
suddenly
resumed
aramis
the
queen
announced
an
interesting
event
there
was
great
joy
at
the
intelligence
and
all
prayed
for
her
happy
delivery
on
the
5th
of
september
1638
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
here
aramis
looked
at
his
companion
and
thought
he
observed
him
turning
pale
you
are
about
to
hear
said
aramis
an
account
which
few
indeed
could
now
avouch
for
it
refers
to
a
secret
which
they
imagined
buried
with
the
dead
entombed
in
the
abyss
of
the
confessional
and
you
will
tell
me
this
secret
broke
in
the
youth
oh
said
aramis
with
unmistakable
emphasis
i
do
not
know
that
i
ought
to
risk
this
secret
by
intrusting
it
to
one
who
has
no
desire
to
quit
the
bastile
i
hear
you
monsieur
the
queen
then
gave
birth
to
a
son
but
while
the
court
was
rejoicing
over
the
event
when
the
king
had
shown
the
newborn
child
to
the
nobility
and
people
and
was
sitting
gayly
down
to
table
to
celebrate
the
event
the
queen
who
was
alone
in
her
room
was
again
taken
ill
and
gave
birth
to
a
second
son
oh
said
the
prisoner
betraying
a
better
acquaintance
with
affairs
than
he
had
owned
to
i
thought
that
monsieur
was
only
born
in
aramis
raised
his
finger
permit
me
to
continue
he
said
the
prisoner
sighed
impatiently
and
paused
yes
said
aramis
the
queen
had
a
second
son
whom
dame
perronnette
the
midwife
received
in
her
arms
dame
perronnette
murmured
the
young
man
they
ran
at
once
to
the
banquetingroom
and
whispered
to
the
king
what
had
happened
he
rose
and
quitted
the
table
but
this
time
it
was
no
longer
happiness
that
his
face
expressed
but
something
akin
to
terror
the
birth
of
twins
changed
into
bitterness
the
joy
to
which
that
of
an
only
son
had
given
rise
seeing
that
in
france
a
fact
you
are
assuredly
ignorant
of
it
is
the
oldest
of
the
kings
sons
who
succeeds
his
father
i
know
it
and
that
the
doctors
and
jurists
assert
that
there
is
ground
for
doubting
whether
the
son
that
first
makes
his
appearance
is
the
elder
by
the
law
of
heaven
and
of
nature
the
prisoner
uttered
a
smothered
cry
and
became
whiter
than
the
coverlet
under
which
he
hid
himself
now
you
understand
pursued
aramis
that
the
king
who
with
so
much
pleasure
saw
himself
repeated
in
one
was
in
despair
about
two
fearing
that
the
second
might
dispute
the
firsts
claim
to
seniority
which
had
been
recognized
only
two
hours
before
and
so
this
second
son
relying
on
party
interests
and
caprices
might
one
day
sow
discord
and
engender
civil
war
throughout
the
kingdom
by
these
means
destroying
the
very
dynasty
he
should
have
strengthened
oh
i
understandi
understand
murmured
the
young
man
well
continued
aramis
this
is
what
they
relate
what
they
declare
this
is
why
one
of
the
queens
two
sons
shamefully
parted
from
his
brother
shamefully
sequestered
is
buried
in
profound
obscurity
this
is
why
that
second
son
has
disappeared
and
so
completely
that
not
a
soul
in
france
save
his
mother
is
aware
of
his
existence
yes
his
mother
who
has
cast
him
off
cried
the
prisoner
in
a
tone
of
despair
except
also
aramis
went
on
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
and
finally
excepting
excepting
yourselfis
it
not
you
who
come
and
relate
all
this
you
who
rouse
in
my
soul
curiosity
hatred
ambition
and
perhaps
even
the
thirst
of
vengeance
except
you
monsieur
who
if
you
are
the
man
to
whom
i
expect
whom
the
note
i
have
received
applies
to
whom
in
short
heaven
ought
to
send
me
must
possess
about
you
what
asked
aramis
a
portrait
of
the
king
louis
xiv
who
at
this
moment
reigns
upon
the
throne
of
france
here
is
the
portrait
replied
the
bishop
handing
the
prisoner
a
miniature
in
enamel
on
which
louis
was
depicted
lifelike
with
a
handsome
lofty
mien
the
prisoner
eagerly
seized
the
portrait
and
gazed
at
it
with
devouring
eyes
and
now
monseigneur
said
aramis
here
is
a
mirror
aramis
left
the
prisoner
time
to
recover
his
ideas
so
highso
high
murmured
the
young
man
eagerly
comparing
the
likeness
of
louis
with
his
own
countenance
reflected
in
the
glass
what
do
you
think
of
it
at
length
said
aramis
i
think
that
i
am
lost
replied
the
captive
the
king
will
never
set
me
free
and
ii
demand
to
know
added
the
bishop
fixing
his
piercing
eyes
significantly
upon
the
prisoner
i
demand
to
know
which
of
these
two
is
king
the
one
this
miniature
portrays
or
whom
the
glass
reflects
the
king
monsieur
sadly
replied
the
young
man
is
he
who
is
on
the
throne
who
is
not
in
prison
and
who
on
the
other
hand
can
cause
others
to
be
entombed
there
royalty
means
power
and
you
behold
how
powerless
i
am
monseigneur
answered
aramis
with
a
respect
he
had
not
yet
manifested
the
king
mark
me
will
if
you
desire
it
be
the
one
that
quitting
his
dungeon
shall
maintain
himself
upon
the
throne
on
which
his
friends
will
place
him
tempt
me
not
monsieur
broke
in
the
prisoner
bitterly
be
not
weak
monseigneur
persisted
aramis
i
have
brought
you
all
the
proofs
of
your
birth
consult
them
satisfy
yourself
that
you
are
a
kings
son
it
is
for
us
to
act
no
no
it
is
impossible
unless
indeed
resumed
the
bishop
ironically
it
be
the
destiny
of
your
race
that
the
brothers
excluded
from
the
throne
should
be
always
princes
void
of
courage
and
honesty
as
was
your
uncle
m
gaston
dorleans
who
ten
times
conspired
against
his
brother
louis
xiii
what
cried
the
prince
astonished
my
uncle
gaston
conspired
against
his
brother
conspired
to
dethrone
him
exactly
monseigneur
for
no
other
reason
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
he
had
friendsdevoted
friends
as
much
so
as
i
am
to
you
and
after
all
what
did
he
dofailed
he
failed
i
admit
but
always
through
his
own
fault
and
for
the
sake
of
purchasingnot
his
lifefor
the
life
of
the
kings
brother
is
sacred
and
inviolablebut
his
liberty
he
sacrificed
the
lives
of
all
his
friends
one
after
another
and
so
at
this
day
he
is
a
very
blot
on
history
the
detestation
of
a
hundred
noble
families
in
this
kingdom
i
understand
monsieur
either
by
weakness
or
treachery
my
uncle
slew
his
friends
by
weakness
which
in
princes
is
always
treachery
and
cannot
a
man
fail
then
from
incapacity
and
ignorance
do
you
really
believe
it
possible
that
a
poor
captive
such
as
i
brought
up
not
only
at
a
distance
from
the
court
but
even
from
the
worlddo
you
believe
it
possible
that
such
a
one
could
assist
those
of
his
friends
who
should
attempt
to
serve
him
and
as
aramis
was
about
to
reply
the
young
man
suddenly
cried
out
with
a
violence
which
betrayed
the
temper
of
his
blood
we
are
speaking
of
friends
but
how
can
i
have
any
friendsi
whom
no
one
knows
and
have
neither
liberty
money
nor
influence
to
gain
any
i
fancy
i
had
the
honor
to
offer
myself
to
your
royal
highness
oh
do
not
style
me
so
monsieur
tis
either
treachery
or
cruelty
bid
me
not
think
of
aught
beyond
these
prisonwalls
which
so
grimly
confine
me
let
me
again
love
or
at
least
submit
to
my
slavery
and
my
obscurity
monseigneur
monseigneur
if
you
again
utter
these
desperate
wordsif
after
having
received
proof
of
your
high
birth
you
still
remain
poorspirited
in
body
and
soul
i
will
comply
with
your
desire
i
will
depart
and
renounce
forever
the
service
of
a
master
to
whom
so
eagerly
i
came
to
devote
my
assistance
and
my
life
monsieur
cried
the
prince
would
it
not
have
been
better
for
you
to
have
reflected
before
telling
me
all
that
you
have
done
that
you
have
broken
my
heart
forever
and
so
i
desire
to
do
monseigneur
to
talk
to
me
about
power
grandeur
eye
and
to
prate
of
thrones
is
a
prison
the
fit
place
you
wish
to
make
me
believe
in
splendor
and
we
are
lying
lost
in
night
you
boast
of
glory
and
we
are
smothering
our
words
in
the
curtains
of
this
miserable
bed
you
give
me
glimpses
of
power
absolute
whilst
i
hear
the
footsteps
of
the
everywatchful
jailer
in
the
corridorthat
step
which
after
all
makes
you
tremble
more
than
it
does
me
to
render
me
somewhat
less
incredulous
free
me
from
the
bastile
let
me
breathe
the
fresh
air
give
me
my
spurs
and
trusty
sword
then
we
shall
begin
to
understand
each
other
it
is
precisely
my
intention
to
give
you
all
this
monseigneur
and
more
only
do
you
desire
it
a
word
more
said
the
prince
i
know
there
are
guards
in
every
gallery
bolts
to
every
door
cannon
and
soldiery
at
every
barrier
how
will
you
overcome
the
sentriesspike
the
guns
how
will
you
break
through
the
bolts
and
bars
monseigneurhow
did
you
get
the
note
which
announced
my
arrival
to
you
you
can
bribe
a
jailer
for
such
a
thing
as
a
note
if
we
can
corrupt
one
turnkey
we
can
corrupt
ten
well
i
admit
that
it
may
be
possible
to
release
a
poor
captive
from
the
bastile
possible
so
to
conceal
him
that
the
kings
people
shall
not
again
ensnare
him
possible
in
some
unknown
retreat
to
sustain
the
unhappy
wretch
in
some
suitable
manner
monseigneur
said
aramis
smiling
i
admit
that
whoever
would
do
this
much
for
me
would
seem
more
than
mortal
in
my
eyes
but
as
you
tell
me
i
am
a
prince
brother
of
the
king
how
can
you
restore
me
the
rank
and
power
which
my
mother
and
my
brother
have
deprived
me
of
and
as
to
effect
this
i
must
pass
a
life
of
war
and
hatred
how
can
you
cause
me
to
prevail
in
those
combatsrender
me
invulnerable
by
my
enemies
ah
monsieur
reflect
on
all
this
place
me
tomorrow
in
some
dark
cavern
at
a
mountains
base
yield
me
the
delight
of
hearing
in
freedom
sounds
of
the
river
plain
and
valley
of
beholding
in
freedom
the
sun
of
the
blue
heavens
or
the
stormy
sky
and
it
is
enough
promise
me
no
more
than
this
for
indeed
more
you
cannot
give
and
it
would
be
a
crime
to
deceive
me
since
you
call
yourself
my
friend
aramis
waited
in
silence
monseigneur
he
resumed
after
a
moments
reflection
i
admire
the
firm
sound
sense
which
dictates
your
words
i
am
happy
to
have
discovered
my
monarchs
mind
again
again
oh
god
for
mercys
sake
cried
the
prince
pressing
his
icy
hands
upon
his
clammy
brow
do
not
play
with
me
i
have
no
need
to
be
a
king
to
be
the
happiest
of
men
but
i
monseigneur
wish
you
to
be
a
king
for
the
good
of
humanity
ah
said
the
prince
with
fresh
distrust
inspired
by
the
word
ah
with
what
then
has
humanity
to
reproach
my
brother
i
forgot
to
say
monseigneur
that
if
you
would
allow
me
to
guide
you
and
if
you
consent
to
become
the
most
powerful
monarch
in
christendom
you
will
have
promoted
the
interests
of
all
the
friends
whom
i
devote
to
the
success
of
your
cause
and
these
friends
are
numerous
numerous
less
numerous
than
powerful
monseigneur
explain
yourself
it
is
impossible
i
will
explain
i
swear
before
heaven
on
that
day
that
i
see
you
sitting
on
the
throne
of
france
but
my
brother
you
shall
decree
his
fate
do
you
pity
him
him
who
leaves
me
to
perish
in
a
dungeon
no
no
for
him
i
have
no
pity
so
much
the
better
he
might
have
himself
come
to
this
prison
have
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
have
said
my
brother
heaven
created
us
to
love
not
to
contend
with
one
another
i
come
to
you
a
barbarous
prejudice
has
condemned
you
to
pass
your
days
in
obscurity
far
from
mankind
deprived
of
every
joy
i
will
make
you
sit
down
beside
me
i
will
buckle
round
your
waist
our
fathers
sword
will
you
take
advantage
of
this
reconciliation
to
put
down
or
restrain
me
will
you
employ
that
sword
to
spill
my
blood
oh
never
i
would
have
replied
to
him
i
look
on
you
as
my
preserver
i
will
respect
you
as
my
master
you
give
me
far
more
than
heaven
bestowed
for
through
you
i
possess
liberty
and
the
privilege
of
loving
and
being
loved
in
this
world
and
you
would
have
kept
your
word
monseigneur
on
my
life
while
nownow
that
i
have
guilty
ones
to
punish
in
what
manner
monseigneur
what
do
you
say
as
to
the
resemblance
that
heaven
has
given
me
to
my
brother
i
say
that
there
was
in
that
likeness
a
providential
instruction
which
the
king
ought
to
have
heeded
i
say
that
your
mother
committed
a
crime
in
rendering
those
different
in
happiness
and
fortune
whom
nature
created
so
startlingly
alike
of
her
own
flesh
and
i
conclude
that
the
object
of
punishment
should
be
only
to
restore
the
equilibrium
by
which
you
mean
that
if
i
restore
you
to
your
place
on
your
brothers
throne
he
shall
take
yours
in
prison
alas
theres
such
infinity
of
suffering
in
prison
especially
it
would
be
so
for
one
who
has
drunk
so
deeply
of
the
cup
of
enjoyment
your
royal
highness
will
always
be
free
to
act
as
you
may
desire
and
if
it
seems
good
to
you
after
punishment
you
will
have
it
in
your
power
to
pardon
good
and
now
are
you
aware
of
one
thing
monsieur
tell
me
my
prince
it
is
that
i
will
hear
nothing
further
from
you
till
i
am
clear
of
the
bastile
i
was
going
to
say
to
your
highness
that
i
should
only
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
once
again
and
when
the
day
when
my
prince
leaves
these
gloomy
walls
heavens
how
will
you
give
me
notice
of
it
by
myself
coming
to
fetch
you
yourself
my
prince
do
not
leave
this
chamber
save
with
me
or
if
in
my
absence
you
are
compelled
to
do
so
remember
that
i
am
not
concerned
in
it
and
so
i
am
not
to
speak
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
whatever
save
to
you
save
only
to
me
aramis
bowed
very
low
the
prince
offered
his
hand
monsieur
he
said
in
a
tone
that
issued
from
his
heart
one
word
more
my
last
if
you
have
sought
me
for
my
destruction
if
you
are
only
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
my
enemies
if
from
our
conference
in
which
you
have
sounded
the
depths
of
my
mind
anything
worse
than
captivity
result
that
is
to
say
if
death
befall
me
still
receive
my
blessing
for
you
will
have
ended
my
troubles
and
given
me
repose
from
the
tormenting
fever
that
has
preyed
on
me
for
eight
long
weary
years
monseigneur
wait
the
results
ere
you
judge
me
said
aramis
i
say
that
in
such
a
case
i
bless
and
forgive
you
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
come
to
restore
me
to
that
position
in
the
sunshine
of
fortune
and
glory
to
which
i
was
destined
by
heaven
if
by
your
means
i
am
enabled
to
live
in
the
memory
of
man
and
confer
luster
on
my
race
by
deeds
of
valor
or
by
solid
benefits
bestowed
upon
my
people
if
from
my
present
depths
of
sorrow
aided
by
your
generous
hand
i
raise
myself
to
the
very
height
of
honor
then
to
you
whom
i
thank
with
blessings
to
you
will
i
offer
half
my
power
and
my
glory
though
you
would
still
be
but
partly
recompensed
and
your
share
must
always
remain
incomplete
since
i
could
not
divide
with
you
the
happiness
received
at
your
hands
monseigneur
replied
aramis
moved
by
the
pallor
and
excitement
of
the
young
man
the
nobleness
of
your
heart
fills
me
with
joy
and
admiration
it
is
not
you
who
will
have
to
thank
me
but
rather
the
nation
whom
you
will
render
happy
the
posterity
whose
name
you
will
make
glorious
yes
i
shall
indeed
have
bestowed
upon
you
more
than
life
i
shall
have
given
you
immortality
the
prince
offered
his
hand
to
aramis
who
sank
upon
his
knee
and
kissed
it
it
is
the
first
act
of
homage
paid
to
our
future
king
said
he
when
i
see
you
again
i
shall
say
good
day
sire
till
then
said
the
young
man
pressing
his
wan
and
wasted
fingers
over
his
hearttill
then
no
more
dreams
no
more
strain
on
my
lifemy
heart
would
break
oh
monsieur
how
small
is
my
prisonhow
low
the
windowhow
narrow
are
the
doors
to
think
that
so
much
pride
splendor
and
happiness
should
be
able
to
enter
in
and
to
remain
here
your
royal
highness
makes
me
proud
said
aramis
since
you
infer
it
is
i
who
brought
all
this
and
he
rapped
immediately
on
the
door
the
jailer
came
to
open
it
with
baisemeaux
who
devoured
by
fear
and
uneasiness
was
beginning
in
spite
of
himself
to
listen
at
the
door
happily
neither
of
the
speakers
had
forgotten
to
smother
his
voice
even
in
the
most
passionate
outbreaks
what
a
confessor
said
the
governor
forcing
a
laugh
who
would
believe
that
a
compulsory
recluse
a
man
as
though
in
the
very
jaws
of
death
could
have
committed
crimes
so
numerous
and
so
long
to
tell
of
aramis
made
no
reply
he
was
eager
to
leave
the
bastile
where
the
secret
which
overwhelmed
him
seemed
to
double
the
weight
of
the
walls
as
soon
as
they
reached
baisemeauxs
quarters
let
us
proceed
to
business
my
dear
governor
said
aramis
alas
replied
baisemeaux
you
have
to
ask
me
for
my
receipt
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
said
the
bishop
and
to
pay
over
the
first
third
of
the
sum
added
the
poor
governor
with
a
sigh
taking
three
steps
towards
his
iron
strongbox
here
is
the
receipt
said
aramis
and
here
is
the
money
returned
baisemeaux
with
a
threefold
sigh
the
order
instructed
me
only
to
give
a
receipt
it
said
nothing
about
receiving
the
money
rejoined
aramis
adieu
monsieur
le
governeur
and
he
departed
leaving
baisemeaux
almost
more
than
stifled
with
joy
and
surprise
at
this
regal
present
so
liberally
bestowed
by
the
confessor
extraordinary
to
the
bastile
chapter
ii
how
mouston
had
become
fatter
without
giving
porthos
notice
thereof
and
of
the
troubles
which
consequently
befell
that
worthy
gentleman
since
the
departure
of
athos
for
blois
porthos
and
dartagnan
were
seldom
together
one
was
occupied
with
harassing
duties
for
the
king
the
other
had
been
making
many
purchases
of
furniture
which
he
intended
to
forward
to
his
estate
and
by
aid
of
which
he
hoped
to
establish
in
his
various
residences
something
of
the
courtly
luxury
he
had
witnessed
in
all
its
dazzling
brightness
in
his
majestys
society
dartagnan
ever
faithful
one
morning
during
an
interval
of
service
thought
about
porthos
and
being
uneasy
at
not
having
heard
anything
of
him
for
a
fortnight
directed
his
steps
towards
his
hotel
and
pounced
upon
him
just
as
he
was
getting
up
the
worthy
baron
had
a
pensivenay
more
than
pensivemelancholy
air
he
was
sitting
on
his
bed
only
halfdressed
and
with
legs
dangling
over
the
edge
contemplating
a
host
of
garments
which
with
their
fringes
lace
embroidery
and
slashes
of
illassorted
hues
were
strewed
all
over
the
floor
porthos
sad
and
reflective
as
la
fontaines
hare
did
not
observe
dartagnans
entrance
which
was
moreover
screened
at
this
moment
by
m
mouston
whose
personal
corpulency
quite
enough
at
any
time
to
hide
one
man
from
another
was
effectually
doubled
by
a
scarlet
coat
which
the
intendant
was
holding
up
for
his
masters
inspection
by
the
sleeves
that
he
might
the
better
see
it
all
over
dartagnan
stopped
at
the
threshold
and
looked
in
at
the
pensive
porthos
and
then
as
the
sight
of
the
innumerable
garments
strewing
the
floor
caused
mighty
sighs
to
heave
the
bosom
of
that
excellent
gentleman
dartagnan
thought
it
time
to
put
an
end
to
these
dismal
reflections
and
coughed
by
way
of
announcing
himself
ah
exclaimed
porthos
whose
countenance
brightened
with
joy
ah
ah
here
is
dartagnan
i
shall
then
get
hold
of
an
idea
at
these
words
mouston
doubting
what
was
going
on
behind
him
got
out
of
the
way
smiling
kindly
at
the
friend
of
his
master
who
thus
found
himself
freed
from
the
material
obstacle
which
had
prevented
his
reaching
dartagnan
porthos
made
his
sturdy
knees
crack
again
in
rising
and
crossing
the
room
in
two
strides
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
friend
whom
he
folded
to
his
breast
with
a
force
of
affection
that
seemed
to
increase
with
every
day
ah
he
repeated
you
are
always
welcome
dear
friend
but
just
now
you
are
more
welcome
than
ever
but
you
seem
to
have
the
megrims
here
exclaimed
dartagnan
porthos
replied
by
a
look
expressive
of
dejection
well
then
tell
me
all
about
it
porthos
my
friend
unless
it
is
a
secret
in
the
first
place
returned
porthos
you
know
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
this
then
is
what
saddens
me
wait
a
minute
porthos
let
me
first
get
rid
of
all
this
litter
of
satin
and
velvet
oh
never
mind
said
porthos
contemptuously
it
is
all
trash
trash
porthos
cloth
at
twentyfive
livres
an
ell
gorgeous
satin
regal
velvet
then
you
think
these
clothes
are
splendid
porthos
splendid
ill
wager
that
you
alone
in
france
have
so
many
and
suppose
you
never
had
any
more
made
and
were
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
of
age
which
wouldnt
astonish
me
in
the
very
least
you
could
still
wear
a
new
dress
the
day
of
your
death
without
being
obliged
to
see
the
nose
of
a
single
tailor
from
now
till
then
porthos
shook
his
head
come
my
friend
said
dartagnan
this
unnatural
melancholy
in
you
frightens
me
my
dear
porthos
pray
get
it
out
then
and
the
sooner
the
better
yes
my
friend
so
i
will
if
indeed
it
is
possible
perhaps
you
have
received
bad
news
from
bracieux
no
they
have
felled
the
wood
and
it
has
yielded
a
third
more
than
the
estimate
then
there
has
been
a
fallingoff
in
the
pools
of
pierrefonds
no
my
friend
they
have
been
fished
and
there
is
enough
left
to
stock
all
the
pools
in
the
neighborhood
perhaps
your
estate
at
vallon
has
been
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
no
my
friend
on
the
contrary
the
ground
was
struck
with
lightning
a
hundred
paces
from
the
chateau
and
a
fountain
sprung
up
in
a
place
entirely
destitute
of
water
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
then
the
fact
is
i
have
received
an
invitation
for
the
fete
at
vaux
said
porthos
with
a
lugubrious
expression
well
do
you
complain
of
that
the
king
has
caused
a
hundred
mortal
heartburnings
among
the
courtiers
by
refusing
invitations
and
so
my
dear
friend
you
are
really
going
to
vaux
indeed
i
am
you
will
see
a
magnificent
sight
alas
i
doubt
it
though
everything
that
is
grand
in
france
will
be
brought
together
there
ah
cried
porthos
tearing
out
a
lock
of
hair
in
his
despair
eh
good
heavens
are
you
ill
cried
dartagnan
i
am
as
firm
as
the
pontneuf
it
isnt
that
but
what
is
it
then
tis
that
i
have
no
clothes
dartagnan
stood
petrified
no
clothes
porthos
no
clothes
he
cried
when
i
see
at
least
fifty
suits
on
the
floor
fifty
truly
but
not
one
which
fits
me
what
not
one
that
fits
you
but
are
you
not
measured
then
when
you
give
an
order
to
be
sure
he
is
answered
mouston
but
unfortunately
i
have
gotten
stouter
what
you
stouter
so
much
so
that
i
am
now
bigger
than
the
baron
would
you
believe
it
monsieur
parbleu
it
seems
to
me
that
is
quite
evident
do
you
see
stupid
said
porthos
that
is
quite
evident
be
still
my
dear
porthos
resumed
dartagnan
becoming
slightly
impatient
i
dont
understand
why
your
clothes
should
not
fit
you
because
mouston
has
grown
stouter
i
am
going
to
explain
it
said
porthos
you
remember
having
related
to
me
the
story
of
the
roman
general
antony
who
had
always
seven
wild
boars
kept
roasting
each
cooked
up
to
a
different
point
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
have
his
dinner
at
any
time
of
the
day
he
chose
to
ask
for
it
well
then
i
resolved
as
at
any
time
i
might
be
invited
to
court
to
spend
a
week
i
resolved
to
have
always
seven
suits
ready
for
the
occasion
capitally
reasoned
porthosonly
a
man
must
have
a
fortune
like
yours
to
gratify
such
whims
without
counting
the
time
lost
in
being
measured
the
fashions
are
always
changing
that
is
exactly
the
point
said
porthos
in
regard
to
which
i
flattered
myself
i
had
hit
on
a
very
ingenious
device
tell
me
what
it
is
for
i
dont
doubt
your
genius
you
remember
what
mouston
once
was
then
yes
when
he
used
to
call
himself
mousqueton
and
you
remember
too
the
period
when
he
began
to
grow
fatter
no
not
exactly
i
beg
your
pardon
my
good
mouston
oh
you
are
not
in
fault
monsieur
said
mouston
graciously
you
were
in
paris
and
as
for
us
we
were
at
pierrefonds
well
well
my
dear
porthos
there
was
a
time
when
mouston
began
to
grow
fat
is
that
what
you
wished
to
say
yes
my
friend
and
i
greatly
rejoice
over
the
period
indeed
i
believe
you
do
exclaimed
dartagnan
you
understand
continued
porthos
what
a
world
of
trouble
it
spared
for
me
no
i
dontby
any
means
look
here
my
friend
in
the
first
place
as
you
have
said
to
be
measured
is
a
loss
of
time
even
though
it
occur
only
once
a
fortnight
and
then
one
may
be
travelling
and
then
you
wish
to
have
seven
suits
always
with
you
in
short
i
have
a
horror
of
letting
any
one
take
my
measure
confound
it
either
one
is
a
nobleman
or
not
to
be
scrutinized
and
scanned
by
a
fellow
who
completely
analyzes
you
by
inch
and
linetis
degrading
here
they
find
you
too
hollow
there
too
prominent
they
recognize
your
strong
and
weak
points
see
now
when
we
leave
the
measurers
hands
we
are
like
those
strongholds
whose
angles
and
different
thicknesses
have
been
ascertained
by
a
spy
in
truth
my
dear
porthos
you
possess
ideas
entirely
original
ah
you
see
when
a
man
is
an
engineer
and
has
fortified
belleisletis
natural
my
friend
well
i
had
an
idea
which
would
doubtless
have
proved
a
good
one
but
for
moustons
carelessness
dartagnan
glanced
at
mouston
who
replied
by
a
slight
movement
of
his
body
as
if
to
say
you
will
see
whether
i
am
at
all
to
blame
in
all
this
i
congratulated
myself
then
resumed
porthos
at
seeing
mouston
get
fat
and
i
did
all
i
could
by
means
of
substantial
feeding
to
make
him
stoutalways
in
the
hope
that
he
would
come
to
equal
myself
in
girth
and
could
then
be
measured
in
my
stead
ah
cried
dartagnan
i
seethat
spared
you
both
time
and
humiliation
consider
my
joy
when
after
a
year
and
a
halfs
judicious
feedingfor
i
used
to
feed
him
up
myselfthe
fellow
oh
i
lent
a
good
hand
myself
monsieur
said
mouston
humbly
thats
true
consider
my
joy
when
one
morning
i
perceived
mouston
was
obliged
to
squeeze
in
as
i
once
did
myself
to
get
through
the
little
secret
door
that
those
fools
of
architects
had
made
in
the
chamber
of
the
late
madame
du
vallon
in
the
chateau
of
pierrefonds
and
by
the
way
about
that
door
my
friend
i
should
like
to
ask
you
who
know
everything
why
these
wretches
of
architects
who
ought
to
have
the
compasses
run
into
them
just
to
remind
them
came
to
make
doorways
through
which
nobody
but
thin
people
can
pass
oh
those
doors
answered
dartagnan
were
meant
for
gallants
and
they
have
generally
slight
and
slender
figures
madame
du
vallon
had
no
gallant
answered
porthos
majestically
perfectly
true
my
friend
resumed
dartagnan
but
the
architects
were
probably
making
their
calculations
on
a
basis
of
the
probability
of
your
marrying
again
ah
that
is
possible
said
porthos
and
now
i
have
received
an
explanation
of
how
it
is
that
doorways
are
made
too
narrow
let
us
return
to
the
subject
of
moustons
fatness
but
see
how
the
two
things
apply
to
each
other
i
have
always
noticed
that
peoples
ideas
run
parallel
and
so
observe
this
phenomenon
dartagnan
i
was
talking
to
you
of
mouston
who
is
fat
and
it
led
us
on
to
madame
du
vallon
who
was
thin
hum
is
it
not
marvelous
my
dear
friend
a
savant
of
my
acquaintance
m
costar
has
made
the
same
observation
as
you
have
and
he
calls
the
process
by
some
greek
name
which
i
forget
what
my
remark
is
not
then
original
cried
porthos
astounded
i
thought
i
was
the
discoverer
my
friend
the
fact
was
known
before
aristotles
daysthat
is
to
say
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
well
well
tis
no
less
true
said
porthos
delighted
at
the
idea
of
having
jumped
to
a
conclusion
so
closely
in
agreement
with
the
greatest
sages
of
antiquity
wonderfullybut
suppose
we
return
to
mouston
it
seems
to
me
we
have
left
him
fattening
under
our
very
eyes
yes
monsieur
said
mouston
well
said
porthos
mouston
fattened
so
well
that
he
gratified
all
my
hopes
by
reaching
my
standard
a
fact
of
which
i
was
well
able
to
convince
myself
by
seeing
the
rascal
one
day
in
a
waistcoat
of
mine
which
he
had
turned
into
a
coata
waistcoat
the
mere
embroidery
of
which
was
worth
a
hundred
pistoles
twas
only
to
try
it
on
monsieur
said
mouston
from
that
moment
i
determined
to
put
mouston
in
communication
with
my
tailors
and
to
have
him
measured
instead
of
myself
a
capital
idea
porthos
but
mouston
is
a
foot
and
a
half
shorter
than
you
exactly
they
measured
him
down
to
the
ground
and
the
end
of
the
skirt
came
just
below
my
knee
what
a
marvelous
man
you
are
porthos
such
a
thing
could
happen
only
to
you
ah
yes
pay
your
compliments
you
have
ample
grounds
to
go
upon
it
was
exactly
at
that
timethat
is
to
say
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
agothat
i
set
out
for
belleisle
instructing
mouston
so
as
always
to
have
in
every
event
a
pattern
of
every
fashion
to
have
a
coat
made
for
himself
every
month
and
did
mouston
neglect
complying
with
your
instructions
ah
that
was
anything
but
right
mouston
no
monsieur
quite
the
contrary
quite
the
contrary
no
he
never
forgot
to
have
his
coats
made
but
he
forgot
to
inform
me
that
he
had
got
stouter
but
it
was
not
my
fault
monsieur
your
tailor
never
told
me
and
this
to
such
an
extent
monsieur
continued
porthos
that
the
fellow
in
two
years
has
gained
eighteen
inches
in
girth
and
so
my
last
dozen
coats
are
all
too
large
from
a
foot
to
a
foot
and
a
half
but
the
rest
those
which
were
made
when
you
were
of
the
same
size
they
are
no
longer
the
fashion
my
dear
friend
were
i
to
put
them
on
i
should
look
like
a
fresh
arrival
from
siam
and
as
though
i
had
been
two
years
away
from
court
i
understand
your
difficulty
you
have
how
many
new
suits
nine
thirtysix
and
yet
not
one
to
wear
well
you
must
have
a
thirtyseventh
made
and
give
the
thirtysix
to
mouston
ah
monsieur
said
mouston
with
a
gratified
air
the
truth
is
that
monsieur
has
always
been
very
generous
to
me
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
hadnt
that
idea
or
that
i
was
deterred
by
the
expense
but
it
wants
only
two
days
to
the
fete
i
received
the
invitation
yesterday
made
mouston
post
hither
with
my
wardrobe
and
only
this
morning
discovered
my
misfortune
and
from
now
till
the
day
after
tomorrow
there
isnt
a
single
fashionable
tailor
who
will
undertake
to
make
me
a
suit
that
is
to
say
one
covered
all
over
with
gold
isnt
it
i
wish
it
so
undoubtedly
all
over
oh
we
shall
manage
it
you
wont
leave
for
three
days
the
invitations
are
for
wednesday
and
this
is
only
sunday
morning
tis
true
but
aramis
has
strongly
advised
me
to
be
at
vaux
twentyfour
hours
beforehand
how
aramis
yes
it
was
aramis
who
brought
me
the
invitation
ah
to
be
sure
i
see
you
are
invited
on
the
part
of
m
fouquet
by
no
means
by
the
king
dear
friend
the
letter
bears
the
following
as
large
as
life
m
le
baron
du
vallon
is
informed
that
the
king
has
condescended
to
place
him
on
the
invitation
list
very
good
but
you
leave
with
m
fouquet
and
when
i
think
cried
porthos
stamping
on
the
floor
when
i
think
i
shall
have
no
clothes
i
am
ready
to
burst
with
rage
i
should
like
to
strangle
somebody
or
smash
something
neither
strangle
anybody
nor
smash
anything
porthos
i
will
manage
it
all
put
on
one
of
your
thirtysix
suits
and
come
with
me
to
a
tailor
pooh
my
agent
has
seen
them
all
this
morning
even
m
percerin
who
is
m
percerin
oh
only
the
kings
tailor
oh
ah
yes
said
porthos
who
wished
to
appear
to
know
the
kings
tailor
but
now
heard
his
name
mentioned
for
the
first
time
to
m
percerins
by
jove
i
was
afraid
he
would
be
too
busy
doubtless
he
will
be
but
be
at
ease
porthos
he
will
do
for
me
what
he
wouldnt
do
for
another
only
you
must
allow
yourself
to
be
measured
ah
said
porthos
with
a
sigh
tis
vexatious
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
do
as
others
do
as
the
king
does
what
do
they
measure
the
king
too
does
he
put
up
with
it
the
king
is
a
beau
my
good
friend
and
so
are
you
too
whatever
you
may
say
about
it
porthos
smiled
triumphantly
let
us
go
to
the
kings
tailor
he
said
and
since
he
measures
the
king
i
think
by
my
faith
i
may
do
worse
than
allow
him
to
measure
me
chapter
iii
who
messire
jean
percerin
was
the
kings
tailor
messire
jean
percerin
occupied
a
rather
large
house
in
the
rue
st
honore
near
the
rue
de
larbre
sec
he
was
a
man
of
great
taste
in
elegant
stuffs
embroideries
and
velvets
being
hereditary
tailor
to
the
king
the
preferment
of
his
house
reached
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
charles
ix
from
whose
reign
dated
as
we
know
fancy
in
bravery
difficult
enough
to
gratify
the
percerin
of
that
period
was
a
huguenot
like
ambrose
pare
and
had
been
spared
by
the
queen
of
navarre
the
beautiful
margot
as
they
used
to
write
and
say
too
in
those
days
because
in
sooth
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
make
for
her
those
wonderful
ridinghabits
which
she
so
loved
to
wear
seeing
that
they
were
marvelously
well
suited
to
hide
certain
anatomical
defects
which
the
queen
of
navarre
used
very
studiously
to
conceal
percerin
being
saved
made
out
of
gratitude
some
beautiful
black
bodices
very
inexpensively
indeed
for
queen
catherine
who
ended
by
being
pleased
at
the
preservation
of
a
huguenot
people
on
whom
she
had
long
looked
with
detestation
but
percerin
was
a
very
prudent
man
and
having
heard
it
said
that
there
was
no
more
dangerous
sign
for
a
protestant
than
to
be
smiled
up
on
by
catherine
and
having
observed
that
her
smiles
were
more
frequent
than
usual
he
speedily
turned
catholic
with
all
his
family
and
having
thus
become
irreproachable
attained
the
lofty
position
of
master
tailor
to
the
crown
of
france
under
henry
iii
gay
king
as
he
was
this
position
was
as
grand
as
the
height
of
one
of
the
loftiest
peaks
of
the
cordilleras
now
percerin
had
been
a
clever
man
all
his
life
and
by
way
of
keeping
up
his
reputation
beyond
the
grave
took
very
good
care
not
to
make
a
bad
death
of
it
and
so
contrived
to
die
very
skillfully
and
that
at
the
very
moment
he
felt
his
powers
of
invention
declining
he
left
a
son
and
a
daughter
both
worthy
of
the
name
they
were
called
upon
to
bear
the
son
a
cutter
as
unerring
and
exact
as
the
square
rule
the
daughter
apt
at
embroidery
and
at
designing
ornaments
the
marriage
of
henry
iv
and
marie
de
medici
and
the
exquisite
courtmourning
for
the
aforementioned
queen
together
with
a
few
words
let
fall
by
m
de
bassompiere
king
of
the
beaux
of
the
period
made
the
fortune
of
the
second
generation
of
percerins
m
concino
concini
and
his
wife
galligai
who
subsequently
shone
at
the
french
court
sought
to
italianize
the
fashion
and
introduced
some
florentine
tailors
but
percerin
touched
to
the
quick
in
his
patriotism
and
his
selfesteem
entirely
defeated
these
foreigners
and
that
so
well
that
concino
was
the
first
to
give
up
his
compatriots
and
held
the
french
tailor
in
such
esteem
that
he
would
never
employ
any
other
and
thus
wore
a
doublet
of
his
on
the
very
day
that
vitry
blew
out
his
brains
with
a
pistol
at
the
pont
du
louvre
and
so
it
was
a
doublet
issuing
from
m
percerins
workshop
which
the
parisians
rejoiced
in
hacking
into
so
many
pieces
with
the
living
human
body
it
contained
notwithstanding
the
favor
concino
concini
had
shown
percerin
the
king
louis
xiii
had
the
generosity
to
bear
no
malice
to
his
tailor
and
to
retain
him
in
his
service
at
the
time
that
louis
the
just
afforded
this

example
of

brought
up
two
sons

of
whom
made
his
debut
at
the
marriage
of
anne
of
austria
invented
that
admirable
spanish
costume
in
which
richelieu
danced
a
saraband
made
the
costumes
for
the
tragedy
of
mirame
and
stitched
on
to

those
famous
pearls
which
were
destined
to
be
scattered
about

pavements
of

thus

attained
the
summit
of
his
glory

died

further
dressed

and
having
no
son
which
was
a
great
cause
of
sorrow
to
him
seeing
that
with
himself
his
dynasty
would
end
he
had
brought
up
several
hopeful
pupils
he
possessed

authority
from

worked
for

as
he
was
and
versed
in

he
never
succeeded
in
fitting

this
is
beyond
explanation
it
is
a
matter
for
guessing
or
for
intuition
great
geniuses
of
every
kind
live
on
unseen
intangible
ideas
they
act
without
themselves
knowing
why
the
great
percerin
for
contrary
to
the
rule
of
dynasties
it
was
above
all
the
last
of
the
percerins
who
deserved
the
name
of
great
the
great
percerin
was
inspired
when
he
cut
a
robe
for
the
queen
or
a
coat
for
the
king
he
could
mount
a
mantle
for
monsieur
the
clock
of
a
stocking
for
madame
but
in
spite
of
his
supreme
talent
he
could
never
hit
off
anything
approaching
a
creditable
fit
for
m
colbert
that
man
he
used
often
to
say
is
beyond
my
art
my
needle
can
never
dot
him
down
we
need
scarcely
say
that
percerin
was
m
fouquets
tailor
and
that
the
superintendent
highly
esteemed
him
m
percerin
was
nearly
eighty
years
old
nevertheless
still
fresh
and
at
the
same
time
so
dry
the
courtiers
used
to
say
that
he
was
positively
brittle
his
renown
and
his
fortune
were
great
enough
for
m
le
prince
that
king
of
fops
to
take
his
arm
when
talking
over
the
fashions
and
for
those
least
eager
to
pay
never
to
dare
to
leave
their
accounts
in
arrear
with
him
for
master
percerin
would
for
the
first
time
make
clothes
upon
credit
but
the
second
never
unless
paid
for
the
former
order
it
is
easy
to
see
at
once
that
a
tailor
of
such
renown
instead
of
running
after
customers
made
difficulties
about
obliging
any
fresh
ones
and
so
percerin
declined
to
fit
bourgeois
or
those
who
had
but
recently
obtained
patents
of
nobility
a
story
used
to
circulate
that
even
m
de
mazarin
in
exchange
for
percerin
supplying
him
with
a
full
suit
of
ceremonial
vestments
as
cardinal
one
fine
day
slipped
letters
of
nobility
into
his
pocket
it
was
to
the
house
of
this
grand
llama
of
tailors
that
dartagnan
took
the
despairing
porthos
who
as
they
were
going
along
said
to
his
friend
take
care
my
good
dartagnan
not
to
compromise
the
dignity
of
a
man
such
as
i
am
with
the
arrogance
of
this
percerin
who
will
i
expect
be
very
impertinent
for
i
give
you
notice
my
friend
that
if
he
is
wanting
in
respect
i
will
infallibly
chastise
him
presented
by
me
replied
dartagnan
you
have
nothing
to
fear
even
though
you
were
what
you
are
not
ah
tis
because
what
have
you
anything
against
percerin
porthos
i
think
that
i
once
sent
mouston
to
a
fellow
of
that
name
and
then
the
fellow
refused
to
supply
me
oh
a
misunderstanding
no
doubt
which
it
will
be
now
exceedingly
easy
to
set
right
mouston
must
have
made
a
mistake
perhaps
he
has
confused
the
names
possibly
that
rascal
mouston
never
can
remember
names
i
will
take
it
all
upon
myself
very
good
stop
the
carriage
porthos
here
we
are
here
how
here
we
are
at
the
halles
and
you
told
me
the
house
was
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
larbre
sec
tis
true
but
look
well
i
do
look
and
i
see
what
pardieu
that
we
are
at
the
halles
you
do
not
i
suppose
want
our
horses
to
clamber
up
on
the
roof
of
the
carriage
in
front
of
us
no
nor
the
carriage
in
front
of
us
to
mount
on
top
of
the
one
in
front
of
it
nor
that
the
second
should
be
driven
over
the
roofs
of
the
thirty
or
forty
others
which
have
arrived
before
us
no
you
are
right
indeed
what
a
number
of
people
and
what
are
they
all
about
tis
very
simple
they
are
waiting
their
turn
bah
have
the
comedians
of
the
hotel
de
bourgogne
shifted
their
quarters
no
their
turn
to
obtain
an
entrance
to
m
percerins
house
and
we
are
going
to
wait
too
oh
we
shall
show
ourselves
prompter
and
not
so
proud
what
are
we
to
do
then
get
down
pass
through
the
footmen
and
lackeys
and
enter
the
tailors
house
which
i
will
answer
for
our
doing
if
you
go
first
come
along
then
said
porthos
they
accordingly
alighted
and
made
their
way
on
foot
towards
the
establishment
the
cause
of
the
confusion
was
that
m
percerins
doors
were
closed
while
a
servant
standing
before
them
was
explaining
to
the
illustrious
customers
of
the
illustrious
tailor
that
just
then
m
percerin
could
not
receive
anybody
it
was
bruited
about
outside
still
on
the
authority
of
what
the
great
lackey
had
told
some
great
noble
whom
he
favored
in
confidence
that
m
percerin
was
engaged
on
five
costumes
for
the
king
and
that
owing
to
the
urgency
of
the
case
he
was
meditating
in
his
office
on
the
ornaments
colors
and
cut
of
these
five
suits
some
contented
with
this
reason
went
away
again
contented
to
repeat
the
tale
to
others
but
others
more
tenacious
insisted
on
having
the
doors
opened
and
among
these
last
three
blue
ribbons
intended
to
take
parts
in
a
ballet
which
would
inevitably
fail
unless
the
said
three
had
their
costumes
shaped
by
the
very
hand
of
the
great
percerin
himself
dartagnan
pushing
on
porthos
who
scattered
the
groups
of
people
right
and
left
succeeded
in
gaining
the
counter
behind
which
the
journeyman
tailors
were
doing
their
best
to
answer
queries
we
forgot
to
mention
that
at
the
door
they
wanted
to
put
off
porthos
like
the
rest
but
dartagnan
showing
himself
pronounced
merely
these
words
the
kings
order
and
was
let
in
with
his
friend
the
poor
fellows
had
enough
to
do
and
did
their
best
to
reply
to
the
demands
of
the
customers
in
the
absence
of
their
master
leaving
off
drawing
a
stitch
to
knit
a
sentence
and
when
wounded
pride
or
disappointed
expectation
brought
down
upon
them
too
cutting
a
rebuke
he
who
was
attacked
made
a
dive
and
disappeared
under
the
counter
the
line
of
discontented
lords
formed
a
truly
remarkable
picture
our
captain
of
musketeers
a
man
of
sure
and
rapid
observation
took
it
all
in
at
a
glance
and
having
run
over
the
groups
his
eye
rested
on
a
man
in
front
of
him
this
man
seated
upon
a
stool
scarcely
showed
his
head
above
the
counter
that
sheltered
him
he
was
about
forty
years
of
age
with
a
melancholy
aspect
pale
face
and
soft
luminous
eyes
he
was
looking
at
dartagnan
and
the
rest
with
his
chin
resting
upon
his
hand
like
a
calm
and
inquiring
amateur
only
on
perceiving
and
doubtless
recognizing
our
captain
he
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
it
was
this
action
perhaps
that
attracted
dartagnans
attention
if
so
the
gentleman
who
had
pulled
down
his
hat
produced
an
effect
entirely
different
from
what
he
had
desired
in
other
respects
his
costume
was
plain
and
his
hair
evenly
cut
enough
for
customers
who
were
not
close
observers
to
take
him
for
a
mere
tailors
apprentice
perched
behind
the
board
and
carefully
stitching
cloth
or
velvet
nevertheless
this
man
held
up
his
head
too
often
to
be
very
productively
employed
with
his
fingers
dartagnan
was
not
deceivednot
he
and
he
saw
at
once
that
if
this
man
was
working
at
anything
it
certainly
was
not
at
velvet
eh
said
he
addressing
this
man
and
so
you
have
become
a
tailors
boy
monsieur
moliere
hush
m
dartagnan
replied
the
man
softly
you
will
make
them
recognize
me
well
and
what
harm
the
fact
is
there
is
no
harm
but
you
were
going
to
say
there
is
no
good
in
doing
it
either
is
it
not
so
alas
no
for
i
was
occupied
in
examining
some
excellent
figures
go
ongo
on
monsieur
moliere
i
quite
understand
the
interest
you
take
in
the
platesi
will
not
disturb
your
studies
thank
you
but
on
one
condition
that
you
tell
me
where
m
percerin
really
is
oh
willingly
in
his
own
room
only
only
that
one
cant
enter
it
unapproachable
for
everybody
everybody
he
brought
me
here
so
that
i
might
be
at
my
ease
to
make
my
observations
and
then
he
went
away
well
my
dear
monsieur
moliere
but
you
will
go
and
tell
him
i
am
here
i
exclaimed
moliere
in
the
tone
of
a
courageous
dog
from
which
you
snatch
the
bone
it
has
legitimately
gained
i
disturb
myself
ah
monsieur
dartagnan
how
hard
you
are
upon
me
if
you
dont
go
directly
and
tell
m
percerin
that
i
am
here
my
dear
moliere
said
dartagnan
in
a
low
tone
i
warn
you
of
one
thing
that
i
wont
exhibit
to
you
the
friend
i
have
brought
with
me
moliere
indicated
porthos
by
an
imperceptible
gesture
this
gentleman
is
it
not
yes
moliere
fixed
upon
porthos
one
of
those
looks
which
penetrate
the
minds
and
hearts
of
men
the
subject
doubtless
appeared
a
very
promising
one
for
he
immediately
rose
and
led
the
way
into
the
adjoining
chamber
chapter
iv
the
patterns
during
all
this
time
the
noble
mob
was
slowly
heaving
away
leaving
at
every
angle
of
the
counter
either
a
murmur
or
a
menace
as
the
waves
leave
foam
or
scattered
seaweed
on
the
sands
when
they
retire
with
the
ebbing
tide
in
about
ten
minutes
moliere
reappeared
making
another
sign
to
dartagnan
from
under
the
hangings
the
latter
hurried
after
him
with
porthos
in
the
rear
and
after
threading
a
labyrinth
of
corridors
introduced
him
to
m
percerins
room
the
old
man
with
his
sleeves
turned
up
was
gathering
up
in
folds
a
piece
of
goldflowered
brocade
so
as
the
better
to
exhibit
its
luster
perceiving
dartagnan
he
put
the
silk
aside
and
came
to
meet
him
by
no
means
radiant
with
joy
and
by
no
means
courteous
but
take
it
altogether
in
a
tolerably
civil
manner
the
captain
of
the
kings
musketeers
will
excuse
me
i
am
sure
for
i
am
engaged
eh
yes
on
the
kings
costumes
i
know
that
my
dear
monsieur
percerin
you
are
making
three
they
tell
me
five
my
dear
sir
five
three
or
five
tis
all
the
same
to
me
my
dear
monsieur
and
i
know
that
you
will
make
them
most
exquisitely
yes
i
know
once
made
they
will
be
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
i
do
not
deny
it
but
that
they
may
be
the
most
beautiful
in
the
word
they
must
first
be
made
and
to
do
this
captain
i
am
pressed
for
time
oh
bah
there
are
two
days
yet
tis
much
more
than
you
require
monsieur
percerin
said
dartagnan
in
the
coolest
possible
manner
percerin
raised
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
little
accustomed
to
be
contradicted
even
in
his
whims
but
dartagnan
did
not
pay
the
least
attention
to
the
airs
which
the
illustrious
tailor
began
to
assume
my
dear
m
percerin
he
continued
i
bring
you
a
customer
ah
ah
exclaimed
percerin
crossly
m
le
baron
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
continued
dartagnan
percerin
attempted
a
bow
which
found
no
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
terrible
porthos
who
from
his
first
entry
into
the
room
had
been
regarding
the
tailor
askance
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
concluded
dartagnan
i
will
attend
to
monsieur
said
percerin
but
later
later
but
when
when
i
have
time
you
have
already
told
my
valet
as
much
broke
in
porthos
discontentedly
very
likely
said
percerin
i
am
nearly
always
pushed
for
time
my
friend
returned
porthos
sententiously
there
is
always
time
to
be
found
when
one
chooses
to
seek
it
percerin
turned
crimson
an
ominous
sign
indeed
in
old
men
blanched
by
age
monsieur
is
quite
at
liberty
to
confer
his
custom
elsewhere
come
come
percerin
interposed
dartagnan
you
are
not
in
a
good
temper
today
well
i
will
say
one
more
word
to
you
which
will
bring
you
on
your
knees
monsieur
is
not
only
a
friend
of
mine
but
more
a
friend
of
m
fouquets
ah
ah
exclaimed
the
tailor
that
is
another
thing
then
turning
to
porthos
monsieur
le
baron
is
attached
to
the
superintendent
he
inquired
i
am
attached
to
myself
shouted
porthos
at
the
very
moment
that
the
tapestry
was
raised
to
introduce
a
new
speaker
in
the
dialogue
moliere
was
all
observation
dartagnan
laughed
porthos
swore
my
dear
percerin
said
dartagnan
you
will
make
a
dress
for
the
baron
tis
i
who
ask
you
to
you
i
will
not
say
nay
captain
but
that
is
not
all
you
will
make
it
for
him
at
once
tis
impossible
within
eight
days
that
then
is
as
much
as
to
refuse
because
the
dress
is
wanted
for
the
fete
at
vaux
i
repeat
that
it
is
impossible
returned
the
obstinate
old
man
by
no
means
dear
monsieur
percerin
above
all
if
i
ask
you
said
a
mild
voice
at
the
door
a
silvery
voice
which
made
dartagnan
prick
up
his
ears
it
was
the
voice
of
aramis
monsieur
dherblay
cried
the
tailor
aramis
murmured
dartagnan
ah
our
bishop
said
porthos
good
morning
dartagnan
good
morning
porthos
goodmorning
my
dear
friends
said
aramis
come
come
m
percerin
make
the
barons
dress
and
i
will
answer
for
it
you
will
gratify
m
fouquet
and
he
accompanied
the
words
with
a
sign
which
seemed
to
say
agree
and
dismiss
them
it
appeared
that
aramis
had
over
master
percerin
an
influence
superior
even
to
dartagnans
for
the
tailor
bowed
in
assent
and
turning
round
upon
porthos
said
go
and
get
measured
on
the
other
side
porthos
colored
in
a
formidable
manner
dartagnan
saw
the
storm
coming
and
addressing
moliere
said
to
him
in
an
undertone
you
see
before
you
my
dear
monsieur
a
man
who
considers
himself
disgraced
if
you
measure
the
flesh
and
bones
that
heaven
has
given
him
study
this
type
for
me
master
aristophanes
and
profit
by
it
moliere
had
no
need
of
encouragement
and
his
gaze
dwelt
long
and
keenly
on
the
baron
porthos
monsieur
he
said
if
you
will
come
with
me
i
will
make
them
take
your
measure
without
touching
you
oh
said
porthos
how
do
you
make
that
out
my
friend
i
say
that
they
shall
apply
neither
line
nor
rule
to
the
seams
of
your
dress
it
is
a
new
method
we
have
invented
for
measuring
people
of
quality
who
are
too
sensitive
to
allow
lowborn
fellows
to
touch
them
we
know
some
susceptible
persons
who
will
not
put
up
with
being
measured
a
process
which
as
i
think
wounds
the
natural
dignity
of
a
man
and
if
perchance
monsieur
should
be
one
of
these
corboeuf
i
believe
i
am
too
well
that
is
a
capital
and
most
consolatory
coincidence
and
you
shall
have
the
benefit
of
our
invention
but
how
in
the
world
can
it
be
done
asked
porthos
delighted
monsieur
said
moliere
bowing
if
you
will
deign
to
follow
me
you
will
see
aramis
observed
this
scene
with
all
his
eyes
perhaps
he
fancied
from
dartagnans
liveliness
that
he
would
leave
with
porthos
so
as
not
to
lose
the
conclusion
of
a
scene
well
begun
but
clearsighted
as
he
was
aramis
deceived
himself
porthos
and
moliere
left
together
dartagnan
remained
with
percerin
why
from
curiosity
doubtless
probably
to
enjoy
a
little
longer
the
society
of
his
good
friend
aramis
as
moliere
and
porthos
disappeared
dartagnan
drew
near
the
bishop
of
vannes
a
proceeding
which
appeared
particularly
to
disconcert
him
a
dress
for
you
also
is
it
not
my
friend
aramis
smiled
no
said
he
you
will
go
to
vaux
however
i
shall
go
but
without
a
new
dress
you
forget
dear
dartagnan
that
a
poor
bishop
of
vannes
is
not
rich
enough
to
have
new
dresses
for
every
fete
bah
said
the
musketeer
laughing
and
do
we
write
no
more
poems
now
either
oh
dartagnan
exclaimed
aramis
i
have
long
ago
given
up
all
such
tomfoolery
true
repeated
dartagnan
only
half
convinced
as
for
percerin
he
was
once
more
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
brocades
dont
you
perceive
said
aramis
smiling
that
we
are
greatly
boring
this
good
gentleman
my
dear
dartagnan
ah
ah
murmured
the
musketeer
aside
that
is
i
am
boring
you
my
friend
then
aloud
well
then
let
us
leave
i
have
no
further
business
here
and
if
you
are
as
disengaged
as
i
aramis
no
not
ii
wished
ah
you
had
something
particular
to
say
to
m
percerin
why
did
you
not
tell
me
so
at
once
something
particular
certainly
repeated
aramis
but
not
for
you
dartagnan
but
at
the
same
time
i
hope
you
will
believe
that
i
can
never
have
anything
so
particular
to
say
that
a
friend
like
you
may
not
hear
it
oh
no
no
i
am
going
said
dartagnan
imparting
to
his
voice
an
evident
tone
of
curiosity
for
aramiss
annoyance
well
dissembled
as
it
was
had
not
a
whit
escaped
him
and
he
knew
that
in
that
impenetrable
mind
every
thing
even
the
most
apparently
trivial
was
designed
to
some
end
an
unknown
one
but
an
end
that
from
the
knowledge
he
had
of
his
friends
character
the
musketeer
felt
must
be
important
on
his
part
aramis
saw
that
dartagnan
was
not
without
suspicion
and
pressed
him
stay
by
all
means
he
said
this
is
what
it
is
then
turning
towards
the
tailor
my
dear
percerin
said
hei
am
even
very
happy
that
you
are
here
dartagnan
oh
indeed
exclaimed
the
gascon
for
the
third
time
even
less
deceived
this
time
than
before
percerin
never
moved
aramis
roused
him
violently
by
snatching
from
his
hands
the
stuff
upon
which
he
was
engaged
my
dear
percerin
said
he
i
have
near
hand
m
lebrun
one
of
m
fouquets
painters
ah
very
good
thought
dartagnan
but
why
lebrun
aramis
looked
at
dartagnan
who
seemed
to
be
occupied
with
an
engraving
of
mark
antony
and
you
wish
that
i
should
make
him
a
dress
similar
to
those
of
the
epicureans
answered
percerin
and
while
saying
this
in
an
absent
manner
the
worthy
tailor
endeavored
to
recapture
his
piece
of
brocade
an
epicureans
dress
asked
dartagnan
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
i
see
said
aramis
with
a
most
engaging
smile
it
is
written
that
our
dear
dartagnan
shall
know
all
our
secrets
this
evening
yes
friend
you
have
surely
heard
speak
of
m
fouquets
epicureans
have
you
not
undoubtedly
is
it
not
a
kind
of
poetical
society
of
which
la
fontaine
loret
pelisson
and
moliere
are
members
and
which
holds
its
sittings
at
saintmande
exactly
so
well
we
are
going
to
put
our
poets
in
uniform
and
enroll
them
in
a
regiment
for
the
king
oh
very
well
i
understand
a
surprise
m
fouquet
is
getting
up
for
the
king
be
at
ease
if
that
is
the
secret
about
m
lebrun
i
will
not
mention
it
always
agreeable
my
friend
no
monsieur
lebrun
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
part
of
it
the
secret
which
concerns
him
is
far
more
important
than
the
other
then
if
it
is
so
important
as
all
that
i
prefer
not
to
know
it
said
dartagnan
making
a
show
of
departure
come
in
m
lebrun
come
in
said
aramis
opening
a
sidedoor
with
his
right
hand
and
holding
back
dartagnan
with
his
left
ifaith
i
too
am
quite
in
the
dark
quoth
percerin
aramis
took
an
opportunity
as
is
said
in
theatrical
matters
my
dear
m
de
percerin
aramis
continued
you
are
making
five
dresses
for
the
king
are
you
not
one
in
brocade
one
in
huntingcloth
one
in
velvet
one
in
satin
and
one
in
florentine
stuffs
yes
but
howdo
you
know
all
that
monseigneur
said
percerin
astounded
it
is
all
very
simple
my
dear
monsieur
there
will
be
a
hunt
a
banquet
concert
promenade
and
reception
these
five
kinds
of
dress
are
required
by
etiquette
you
know
everything
monseigneur
and
a
thing
or
two
in
addition
muttered
dartagnan
but
cried
the
tailor
in
triumph
what
you
do
not
know
monseigneurprince
of
the
church
though
you
arewhat
nobody
will
knowwhat
only
the
king
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
myself
do
know
is
the
color
of
the
materials
and
nature
of
the
ornaments
and
the
cut
the
ensemble
the
finish
of
it
all
well
said
aramis
that
is
precisely
what
i
have
come
to
ask
you
dear
percerin
ah
bah
exclaimed
the
tailor
terrified
though
aramis
had
pronounced
these
words
in
his
softest
and
most
honeyed
tones
the
request
appeared
on
reflection
so
exaggerated
so
ridiculous
so
monstrous
to
m
percerin
that
first
he
laughed
to
himself
then
aloud
and
finished
with
a
shout
dartagnan
followed
his
example
not
because
he
found
the
matter
so
very
funny
but
in
order
not
to
allow
aramis
to
cool
at
the
outset
i
appear
to
be
hazarding
an
absurd
question
do
i
not
said
aramis
but
dartagnan
who
is
incarnate
wisdom
itself
will
tell
you
that
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
ask
you
this
let
us
see
said
the
attentive
musketeer
perceiving
with
his
wonderful
instinct
that
they
had
only
been
skirmishing
till
now
and
that
the
hour
of
battle
was
approaching
let
us
see
said
percerin
incredulously
why
now
continued
aramis
does
m
fouquet
give
the
king
a
feteis
it
not
to
please
him
assuredly
said
percerin
dartagnan
nodded
assent
by
delicate
attentions
by
some
happy
device
by
a
succession
of
surprises
like
that
of
which
we
were
talkingthe
enrolment
of
our
epicureans
admirable
well
then
this
is
the
surprise
we
intend
m
lebrun
here
is
a
man
who
draws
most
excellently
yes
said
percerin
i
have
seen
his
pictures
and
observed
that
his
dresses
were
highly
elaborated
that
is
why
i
at
once
agreed
to
make
him
a
costumewhether
to
agree
with
those
of
the
epicureans
or
an
original
one
my
dear
monsieur
we
accept
your
offer
and
shall
presently
avail
ourselves
of
it
but
just
now
m
lebrun
is
not
in
want
of
the
dresses
you
will
make
for
himself
but
of
those
you
are
making
for
the
king
percerin
made
a
bound
backwards
which
dartagnancalmest
and
most
appreciative
of
men
did
not
consider
overdone
so
many
strange
and
startling
aspects
wore
the
proposal
which
aramis
had
just
hazarded
the
kings
dresses
give
the
kings
dresses
to
any
mortal
whatever
oh
for
once
monseigneur
your
grace
is
mad
cried
the
poor
tailor
in
extremity
help
me
now
dartagnan
said
aramis
more
and
more
calm
and
smiling
help
me
now
to
persuade
monsieur
for
you
understand
do
you
not
eh
ehnot
exactly
i
declare
what
you
do
not
understand
that
m
fouquet
wishes
to
afford
the
king
the
surprise
of
finding
his
portrait
on
his
arrival
at
vaux
and
that
the
portrait
which
be
a
striking
resemblance
ought
to
be
dressed
exactly
as
the
king
will
be
on
the
day
it
is
shown
oh
yes
yes
said
the
musketeer
nearly
convinced
so
plausible
was
this
reasoning
yes
my
dear
aramis
you
are
right
it
is
a
happy
idea
i
will
wager
it
is
one
of
your
own
aramis
well
i
dont
know
replied
the
bishop
either
mine
or
m
fouquets
then
scanning
percerin
after
noticing
dartagnans
hesitation
well
monsieur
percerin
he
asked
what
do
you
say
to
this
i
say
that
that
you
are
doubtless
free
to
refuse
i
know
welland
i
by
no
means
count
upon
compelling
you
my
dear
monsieur
i
will
say
more
i
even
understand
all
the
delicacy
you
feel
in
taking
up
with
m
fouquets
idea
you
dread
appearing
to
flatter
the
king
a
noble
spirit
m
percerin
a
noble
spirit
the
tailor
stammered
it
would
indeed
be
a
very
pretty
compliment
to
pay
the
young
prince
continued
aramis
but
as
the
surintendant
told
me
if
percerin
refuse
tell
him
that
it
will
not
at
all
lower
him
in
my
opinion
and
i
shall
always
esteem
him
only
only
repeated
percerin
rather
troubled
only
continued
aramis
i
shall
be
compelled
to
say
to
the
kingyou
understand
my
dear
monsieur
percerin
that
these
are
m
fouquets
wordsi
shall
be
constrained
to
say
to
the
king
sire
i
had
intended
to
present
your
majesty
with
your
portrait
but
owing
to
a
feeling
of
delicacy
slightly
exaggerated
perhaps
although
creditable
m
percerin
opposed
the
project
opposed
cried
the
tailor
terrified
at
the
responsibility
which
would
weigh
upon
him
i
to
oppose
the
desire
the
will
of
m
fouquet
when
he
is
seeking
to
please
the
king
oh
what
a
hateful
word
you
have
uttered
monseigneur
oppose
oh
tis
not
i
who
said
it
heaven
have
mercy
on
me
i
call
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
to
witness
it
is
it
not
true
monsieur
dartagnan
that
i
have
opposed
nothing
dartagnan
made
a
sign
indicating
that
he
wished
to
remain
neutral
he
felt
that
there
was
an
intrigue
at
the
bottom
of
it
whether
comedy
or
tragedy
he
was
at
his
wits
end
at
not
being
able
to
fathom
it
but
in
the
meanwhile
wished
to
keep
clear
but
already
percerin
goaded
by
the
idea
that
the
king
was
to
be
told
he
stood
in
the
way
of
a
pleasant
surprise
had
offered
lebrun
a
chair
and
proceeded
to
bring
from
a
wardrobe
four
magnificent
dresses
the
fifth
being
still
in
the
workmens
hands
and
these
masterpieces
he
successively
fitted
upon
four
lay
figures
which
imported
into
france
in
the
time
of
concini
had
been
given
to
percerin
ii
by
marshal
donore
after
the
discomfiture
of
the
italian
tailors
ruined
in
their
competition
the
painter
set
to
work
to
draw
and
then
to
paint
the
dresses
but
aramis
who
was
closely
watching
all
the
phases
of
his
toil
suddenly
stopped
him
i
think
you
have
not
quite
got
it
my
dear
lebrun
he
said
your
colors
will
deceive
you
and
on
canvas
we
shall
lack
that
exact
resemblance
which
is
absolutely
requisite
time
is
necessary
for
attentively
observing
the
finer
shades
quite
true
said
percerin
but
time
is
wanting
and
on
that
head
you
will
agree
with
me
monseigneur
i
can
do
nothing
then
the
affair
will
fail
said
aramis
quietly
and
that
because
of
a
want
of
precision
in
the
colors
nevertheless
lebrun
went
on
copying
the
materials
and
ornaments
with
the
closest
fidelitya
process
which
aramis
watched
with
illconcealed
impatience
what
in
the
world
now
is
the
meaning
of
this
imbroglio
the
musketeer
kept
saying
to
himself
that
will
never
do
said
aramis
m
lebrun
close
your
box
and
roll
up
your
canvas
but
monsieur
cried
the
vexed
painter
the
light
is
abominable
here
an
idea
m
lebrun
an
idea
if
we
had
a
pattern
of
the
materials
for
example
and
with
time
and
a
better
light
oh
then
cried
lebrun
i
would
answer
for
the
effect
good
said
dartagnan
this
ought
to
be
the
knotty
point
of
the
whole
thing
they
want
a
pattern
of
each
of
the
materials
mordioux
will
this
percerin
give
in
now
percerin
beaten
from
his
last
retreat
and
duped
moreover
by
the
feigned
goodnature
of
aramis
cut
out
five
patterns
and
handed
them
to
the
bishop
of
vannes
i
like
this
better
that
is
your
opinion
is
it
not
said
aramis
to
dartagnan
my
dear
aramis
said
dartagnan
my
opinion
is
that
you
are
always
the
same
and
consequently
always
your
friend
said
the
bishop
in
a
charming
tone
yes
yes
said
dartagnan
aloud
then
in
a
low
voice
if
i
am
your
dupe
double
jesuit
that
you
are
i
will
not
be
your
accomplice
and
to
prevent
it
tis
time
i
left
this
placeadieu
aramis
he
added
aloud
adieu
i
am
going
to
rejoin
porthos
then
wait
for
me
said
aramis
pocketing
the
patterns
for
i
have
done
and
shall
be
glad
to
say
a
parting
word
to
our
dear
old
friend
lebrun
packed
up
his
paints
and
brushes
percerin
put
back
the
dresses
into
the
closet
aramis
put
his
hand
on
his
pocket
to
assure
himself
the
patterns
were
secureand
they
all
left
the
study
chapter
v
where
probably
moliere
obtained
his
first
idea
of
the
bourgeois
gentilhomme
dartagnan
found
porthos
in
the
adjoining
chamber
but
no
longer
an
irritated
porthos
or
a
disappointed
porthos
but
porthos
radiant
blooming
fascinating
and
chattering
with
moliere
who
was
looking
upon
him
with
a
species
of
idolatry
and
as
a
man
would
who
had
not
only
never
seen
anything
greater
but
not
even
ever
anything
so
great
aramis
went
straight
up
to
porthos
and
offered
him
his
white
hand
which
lost
itself
in
the
gigantic
clasp
of
his
old
friendan
operation
which
aramis
never
hazarded
without
a
certain
uneasiness
but
the
friendly
pressure
having
been
performed
not
too
painfully
for
him
the
bishop
of
vannes
passed
over
to
moliere
well
monsieur
said
he
will
you
come
with
me
to
saintmande
i
will
go
anywhere
you
like
monseigneur
answered
moliere
to
saintmande
cried
porthos
surprised
at
seeing
the
proud
bishop
of
vannes
fraternizing
with
a
journeyman
tailor
what
aramis
are
you
going
to
take
this
gentleman
to
saintmande
yes
said
aramis
smiling
our
work
is
pressing
and
besides
my
dear
porthos
continued
dartagnan
m
moliere
is
not
altogether
what
he
seems
in
what
way
asked
porthos
why
this
gentleman
is
one
of
m
percerins
chief
clerks
and
is
expected
at
saintmande
to
try
on
the
dresses
which
m
fouquet
has
ordered
for
the
epicureans
tis
precisely
so
said
moliere
yes
monsieur
come
then
my
dear
m
moliere
said
aramis
that
is
if
you
have
done
with
m
du
vallon
we
have
finished
replied
porthos
and
you
are
satisfied
asked
dartagnan
completely
so
replied
porthos
moliere
took
his
leave
of
porthos
with
much
ceremony
and
grasped
the
hand
which
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
furtively
offered
him
pray
monsieur
concluded
porthos
mincingly
above
all
be
exact
you
will
have
your
dress
the
day
after
tomorrow
monsieur
le
baron
answered
moliere
and
he
left
with
aramis
then
dartagnan
taking
porthoss
arm
what
has
this
tailor
done
for
you
my
dear
porthos
he
asked
that
you
are
so
pleased
with
him
what
has
he
done
for
me
my
friend
done
for
me
cried
porthos
enthusiastically
yes
i
ask
you
what
has
he
done
for
you
my
friend
he
has
done
that
which
no
tailor
ever
yet
accomplished
he
has
taken
my
measure
without
touching
me
ah
bah
tell
me
how
he
did
it
first
then
they
went
i
dont
know
where
for
a
number
of
lay
figures
of
all
heights
and
sizes
hoping
there
would
be
one
to
suit
mine
but
the
largestthat
of
the
drummajor
of
the
swiss
guardwas
two
inches
too
short
and
a
half
foot
too
narrow
in
the
chest
indeed
it
is
exactly
as
i
tell
you
dartagnan
but
he
is
a
great
man
or
at
the
very
least
a
great
tailor
is
this
m
moliere
he
was
not
at
all
put
at
fault
by
the
circumstance
what
did
he
do
then
oh
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
ifaith
tis
an
unheardof
thing
that
people
should
have
been
so
stupid
as
not
to
have
discovered
this
method
from
the
first
what
annoyance
and
humiliation
they
would
have
spared
me
not
to
mention
of
the
costumes
my
dear
porthos
yes
thirty
dresses
well
my
dear
porthos
come
tell
me
m
molieres
plan
moliere
you
call
him
so
do
you
i
shall
make
a
point
of
recollecting
his
name
yes
or
poquelin
if
you
prefer
that
no
i
like
moliere
best
when
i
wish
to
recollect
his
name
i
shall
think
of
voliere
an
aviary
and
as
i
have
one
at
pierrefonds
capital
returned
dartagnan
and
m
molieres
plan
tis
this
instead
of
pulling
me
to
pieces
as
all
these
rascals
doof
making
me
bend
my
back
and
double
my
jointsall
of
them
low
and
dishonorable
practices
dartagnan
made
a
sign
of
approbation
with
his
head
monsieur
he
said
to
me
continued
porthos
a
gentleman
ought
to
measure
himself
do
me
the
pleasure
to
draw
near
this
glass
and
i
drew
near
the
glass
i
must
own
i
did
not
exactly
understand
what
this
good
m
voliere
wanted
with
me
moliere
ah
yes
molieremoliere
and
as
the
fear
of
being
measured
still
possessed
me
take
care
said
i
to
him
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
me
i
am
very
ticklish
i
warn
you
but
he
with
his
soft
voice
for
he
is
a
courteous
fellow
we
must
admit
my
friend
he
with
his
soft
voice
monsieur
said
he
that
your
dress
may
fit
you
well
it
must
be
made
according
to
your
figure
your
figure
is
exactly
reflected
in
this
mirror
we
shall
take
the
measure
of
this
reflection
in
fact
said
dartagnan
you
saw
yourself
in
the
glass
but
where
did
they
find
one
in
which
you
could
see
your
whole
figure
my
good
friend
it
is
the
very
glass
in
which
the
king
is
used
to
look
to
see
himself
yes
but
the
king
is
a
foot
and
a
half
shorter
than
you
are
ah
well
i
know
not
how
that
may
be
it
is
no
doubt
a
cunning
way
of
flattering
the
king
but
the
lookingglass
was
too
large
for
me
tis
true
that
its
height
was
made
up
of
three
venetian
plates
of
glass
placed
one
above
another
and
its
breadth
of
three
similar
parallelograms
in
juxtaposition
oh
porthos
what
excellent
words
you
have
command
of
where
in
the
word
did
you
acquire
such
a
voluminous
vocabulary
at
belleisle
aramis
and
i
had
to
use
such
words
in
our
strategic
studies
and
castramentative
experiments
dartagnan
recoiled
as
though
the
sesquipedalian
syllables
had
knocked
the
breath
out
of
his
body
ah
very
good
let
us
return
to
the
lookingglass
my
friend
then
this
good
m
voliere
moliere
yesmoliereyou
are
right
you
will
see
now
my
dear
friend
that
i
shall
recollect
his
name
quite
well
this
excellent
m
moliere
set
to
work
tracing
out
lines
on
the
mirror
with
a
piece
of
spanish
chalk
following
in
all
the
make
of
my
arms
and
my
shoulders
all
the
while
expounding
this
maxim
which
i
thought
admirable
it
is
advisable
that
a
dress
should
not
incommode
its
wearer
in
reality
said
dartagnan
that
is
an
excellent
maxim
which
is
unfortunately
seldom
carried
out
in
practice
that
is
why
i
found
it
all
the
more
astonishing
when
he
expatiated
upon
it
ah
he
expatiated
parbleu
let
me
hear
his
theory
seeing
that
he
continued
one
may
in
awkward
circumstances
or
in
a
troublesome
position
have
ones
doublet
on
ones
shoulder
and
not
desire
to
take
ones
doublet
off
true
said
dartagnan
and
so
continued
m
voliere
moliere
moliere
yes
and
so
went
on
m
moliere
you
want
to
draw
your
sword
monsieur
and
you
have
your
doublet
on
your
back
what
do
you
do
i
take
it
off
i
answered
well
no
he
replied
how
no
i

that
the
dress
should
be
so
well
made
that
it
will
in
no
way
encumber
you
even
in
drawing
your
sword
ah
ah
throw
yourself
on
guard
pursued
he
i
did
it
with
such
wondrous
firmness
that
two
panes
of
glass
burst
out
of
the
window
tis
nothing
nothing
said
he
keep
your
position
i
raised
my
left
arm
in
the
air
the
forearm
gracefully
bent
the
ruffle
drooping
and
my
wrist
curved
while
my
right
arm
half
extended
securely
covered
my
wrist
with
the
elbow
and
my
breast
with
the
wrist

you
have
said
the
very
word
dear
friend
in
the
meanwhile
voliere
moliere
hold
i
should
certainly
after
all
prefer
to
call
himwhat
did
you
say
his
other
name
was
poquelin
i
prefer
to
call
him
poquelin
and
how
will
you
remember
this
name
better
than
the
other
you
understand
he
calls
himself
poquelin
does
he
not
yes
if
i
were
to
call
to
mind
madame
coquenard
good
and
change
coc
into
poc
nard
into
lin
and
instead
of
coquenard
i
shall
have
poquelin
tis
wonderful
cried
dartagnan
astounded
go
on
my
friend
i
am
listening
to
you
with
admiration
this
coquelin
sketched
my
arm
on
the
glass
i
beg
your
pardonpoquelin
what
did
i
say
then
you
said
coquelin
ah
true
this
poquelin
then
sketched
my
arm
on
the
glass
but
he
took
his
time
over
it
he
kept
looking
at
me
a
good
deal
the
fact
is
that
i
must
have
been
looking
particularly
handsome
does
it
weary
you
he
asked
a
little
i
replied
bending
a
little
in
my
hands
but
i
could
hold
out
for
an
hour
or
so
longer
no
no
i
will
not
allow
it
the
willing
fellows
will
make
it
a
duty
to
support
your
arms
as
of
old
men
supported
those
of
the
prophet
very
good
i
answered
that
will
not
be
humiliating
to
you
my
friend
said
i
there
is
i
think
a
great
difference
between
being
supported
and
being
measured
the
distinction
is
full
of
the
soundest
sense
interrupted
dartagnan
then
continued
porthos
he
made
a
sign
two
lads
approached
one
supported
my
left
arm
while
the
other
with
infinite
address
supported
my
right
another
my
man
cried
he
a
third
approached
support
monsieur
by
the
waist
said
he
the
garcon
complied
so
that
you
were
at
rest
asked
dartagnan
perfectly
and
pocquenard
drew
me
on
the
glass
poquelin
my
friend
poquelinyou
are
right
stay
decidedly
i
prefer
calling
him
voliere
yes
and
then
it
was
over
wasnt
it
during
that
time
voliere
drew
me
as
i
appeared
in
the
mirror
twas
delicate
in
him
i
much
like
the
plan
it
is
respectful
and
keeps
every
one
in
his
place
and
there
it
ended
without
a
soul
having
touched
me
my
friend
except
the
three
garcons
who
supported
you
doubtless
but
i
have
i
think
already
explained
to
you
the
difference
there
is
between
supporting
and
measuring
tis
true
answered
dartagnan
who
said
afterwards
to
himself
ifaith
i
greatly
deceive
myself
or
i
have
been
the
means
of
a
good
windfall
to
that
rascal
moliere
and
we
shall
assuredly
see
the
scene
hit
off
to
the
life
in
some
comedy
or
other
porthos
smiled
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
dartagnan
must
i
confess
well
i
was
laughing
over
my
good
fortune
oh
that
is
true
i
dont
know
a
happier
man
than
you
but
what
is
this
last
piece
of
luck
that
has
befallen
you
well
my
dear
fellow
congratulate
me
i
desire
nothing
better
it
seems
that
i
am
the
first
who
has
had
his
measure
taken
in
that
manner
are
you
so
sure
of
it
nearly
so
certain
signs
of
intelligence
which
passed
between
voliere
and
the
other
garcons
showed
me
the
fact
well
my
friend
that
does
not
surprise
me
from
moliere
said
dartagnan
voliere
my
friend
oh
no
no
indeed
i
am
very
willing
to
leave
you
to
go
on
saying
voliere
but
as
for
me
i
shall
continued
to
say
moliere
well
this
i
was
saying
does
not
surprise
me
coming
from
moliere
who
is
a
very
ingenious
fellow
and
inspired
you
with
this
grand
idea
it
will
be
of
great
use
to
him
by
and
by
i
am
sure
wont
it
be
of
use
to
him
indeed
i
believe
you
it
will
and
that
in
the
highest
degreefor
you
see
my
friend
moliere
is
of
all
known
tailors
the
man
who
best

of
which
we
shall
discuss
dartagnan
and
porthos
quitted

and
rejoined
their
carriages

we
will
leave

annoyed
at
having
met

at

to

in
no
very
good
humor
moliere
on
the
other
hand
quite
delighted
at
having
made
such
a
capital
rough
sketch
and
at
knowing
where
to
find
his
original
again
whenever
he
should
desire
to
convert
his
sketch
into

in
the
merriest
of
moods
all
the

in

during
the

at

his
head
leaning
on
his

was
engaged
in
drawing
out
the
plan
of
the
prologue
to
the
facheux
a
comedy
in

to

on
the

by

called
him

of

was
composing
an
account
of
the
fetes
at
vaux
before
those
fetes
had
taken
place
la
fontaine
sauntered
about
from
one
to
the
other
a
peripatetic
absentminded
boring
unbearable
dreamer
who
kept
buzzing
and
humming
at
everybodys
elbow
a
thousand
poetic
abstractions
he
so
often
disturbed
pelisson
that
the
latter
raising
his
head
crossly
said
at
least
la
fontaine
supply
me
with
a
rhyme
since
you
have
the
run
of
the
gardens
at
parnassus
what
rhyme
do
you
want
asked
the
fabler
as
madame
de
sevigne
used
to
call
him
i
want
a
rhyme
to
lumiere
orniere
answered
la
fontaine
ah
but
my
good
friend
one
cannot
talk
of
wheelruts
when
celebrating
the
delights
of
vaux
said
loret
besides
it
doesnt
rhyme
answered
pelisson
what
doesnt
rhyme
cried
la
fontaine
in
surprise
yes
you
have
an
abominable
habit
my
frienda
habit
which
will
ever
prevent
your
becoming
a
poet
of
the
first
order
you
rhyme
in
a
slovenly
manner
oh
oh
you
think
so
do
you
pelisson
yes
i
do
indeed
remember
that
a
rhyme
is
never
good
so
long
as
one
can
find
a
better
then
i
will
never
write
anything
again
save
in
prose
said
la
fontaine
who
had
taken
up
pelissons
reproach
in
earnest
ah
i
often
suspected
i
was
nothing
but
a
rascally
poet
yes
tis
the
very
truth
do
not
say
so
your
remark
is
too
sweeping
and
there
is
much
that
is
good
in
your
fables
and
to
begin
continued
la
fontaine
following
up
his
idea
i
will
go
and
burn
a
hundred
verses
i
have
just
made
where
are
your
verses
in
my
head
well
if
they
are
in
your
head
you
cannot
burn
them
true
said
la
fontaine
but
if
i
do
not
burn
them
well
what
will
happen
if
you
do
not
burn
them
they
will
remain
in
my
mind
and
i
shall
never
forget
them
the
deuce
cried
loret
what
a
dangerous
thing
one
would
go
mad
with
it
the
deuce
the
deuce
repeated
la
fontaine
what
can
i
do
i
have
discovered
the
way
said
moliere
who
had
entered
just
at
this
point
of
the
conversation
what
way
write
them
first
and
burn
them
afterwards
how
simple
well
i
should
never
have
discovered
that
what
a
mind
that
devil
of
a
moliere
has
said
la
fontaine
then
striking
his
forehead
oh
thou
wilt
never
be
aught
but
an
ass
jean
la
fontaine
he
added
what
are
you
saying
there
my
friend
broke
in
moliere
approaching
the
poet
whose
aside
he
had
heard
i
say
i
shall
never
be
aught
but
an
ass
answered
la
fontaine
with
a
heavy
sigh
and
swimming
eyes
yes
my
friend
he
added
with
increasing
grief
it
seems
that
i
rhyme
in
a
slovenly
manner
oh
tis
wrong
to
say
so
nay
i
am
a
poor
creature
who
said
so
parbleu
twas
pelisson
did
you
not
pelisson
pelisson
again
absorbed
in
his
work
took
good
care
not
to
answer
but
if
pelisson
said
you
were
so
cried
moliere
pelisson
has
seriously
offended
you
do
you
think
so
ah
i
advise
you
as
you
are
a
gentleman
not
to
leave
an
insult
like
that
unpunished
what
exclaimed
la
fontaine
did
you
ever
fight
once
only
with
a
lieutenant
in
the
light
horse
what
wrong
had
he
done
you
it
seems
he
ran
away
with
my
wife
ah
ah
said
moliere
becoming
slightly
pale
but
as
at
la
fontaines
declaration
the
others
had
turned
round
moliere
kept
upon
his
lips
the
rallying
smile
which
had
so
nearly
died
away
and
continuing
to
make
la
fontaine
speak
and
what
was
the
result
of
the
duel
the
result
was
that
on
the
ground
my
opponent
disarmed
me
and
then
made
an
apology
promising
never
again
to
set
foot
in
my
house
and
you
considered
yourself
satisfied
said
moliere
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
picked
up
my
sword
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
i
said
i
have
not
fought
you
because
you
were
my
wifes
friend
but
because
i
was
told
i
ought
to
fight
so
as
i
have
never
known
any
peace
save
since
you
made
her
acquaintance
do
me
the
pleasure
to
continue
your
visits
as
heretofore
or
morbleu
let
us
set
to
again
and
so
continued
la
fontaine
he
was
compelled
to
resume
his
friendship
with
madame
and
i
continue
to
be
the
happiest
of
husbands
all
burst
out
laughing
moliere
alone
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
why
perhaps
to
wipe
away
a
tear
perhaps
to
smother
a
sigh
alas
we
know
that
moliere
was
a
moralist
but
he
was
not
a
philosopher
tis
all
one
he
said
returning
to
the
topic
of
the
conversation
pelisson
has
insulted
you
ah
truly
i
had
already
forgotten
it
and
i
am
going
to
challenge
him
on
your
behalf
well
you
can
do
so
if
you
think
it
indispensable
i
do
think
it
indispensable
and
i
am
going
to
stay
exclaimed
la
fontaine
i
want
your
advice
upon
what
this
insult
no
tell
me
really
now
whether
lumiere
does
not
rhyme
with
orniere
i
should
make
them
rhyme
ah
i
knew
you
would
and
i
have
made
a
hundred
thousand
such
rhymes
in
my
time
a
hundred
thousand
cried
la
fontaine
four
times
as
many
as
la
pucelle
which
m
chaplain
is
meditating
is
it
also
on
this
subject
too
that
you
have
composed
a
hundred
thousand
verses
listen
to
me
you
eternally
absentminded
creature
said
moliere
it
is
certain
continued
la
fontaine
that
legume
for
instance
rhymes
with
posthume
in
the
plural
above
all
yes
above
all
in
the
plural
seeing
that
then
it
rhymes
not
with
three
letters
but
with
four
as
orniere
does
with
lumiere
but
give
me
ornieres
and
lumieres
in
the
plural
my
dear
pelisson
said
la
fontaine
clapping
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
his
friend
whose
insult
he
had
quite
forgotten
and
they
will
rhyme
hem
coughed
pelisson
moliere
says
so
and
moliere
is
a
judge
of
such
things
he
declares
he
has
himself
made
a
hundred
thousand
verses
come
said
moliere
laughing
he
is
off
now
it
is
like
rivage
which
rhymes
admirably
with
herbage
i
would
take
my
oath
of
it
but
said
moliere
i
tell
you
all
this
continued
la
fontaine
because
you
are
preparing
a
divertissement
for
vaux
are
you
not
yes
the
facheux
ah
yes
the
facheux
yes
i
recollect
well
i
was
thinking
a
prologue
would
admirably
suit
your
divertissement
doubtless
it
would
suit
capitally
ah
you
are
of
my
opinion
so
much
so
that
i
have
asked
you
to
write
this
very
prologue
you
asked
me
to
write
it
yes
you
and
on
your
refusal
begged
you
to
ask
pelisson
who
is
engaged
upon
it
at
this
moment
ah
that
is
what
pelisson
is
doing
then
ifaith
my
dear
moliere
you
are
indeed
often
right
when
when
you
call
me
absentminded
it
is
a
monstrous
defect
i
will
cure
myself
of
it
and
do
your
prologue
for
you
but
inasmuch
as
pelisson
is
about
it
ah
true
miserable
rascal
that
i
am
loret
was
indeed
right
in
saying
i
was
a
poor
creature
it
was
not
loret
who
said
so
my
friend
well
then
whoever
said
so
tis
the
same
to
me
and
so
your
divertissement
is
called
the
facheux
well
can
you
make
heureux
rhyme
with
facheux
if
obliged
yes
and
even
with
capriceux
oh
no
no
it
would
be
hazardous
and
yet
why
so
there
is
too
great
a
difference
in
the
cadences
i
was
fancying
said
la
fontaine
leaving
moliere
for
loreti
was
fancying
what
were
you
fancying
said
loret
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
make
haste
you
are
writing
the
prologue
to
the
facheux
are
you
not
no
mordieu
it
is
pelisson
ah
pelisson
cried
la
fontaine
going
over
to
him
i
was
fancying
he
continued
that
the
nymph
of
vaux
ah
beautiful
cried
loret
the
nymph
of
vaux
thank
you
la
fontaine
you
have
just
given
me
the
two
concluding
verses
of
my
paper
well
if
you
can
rhyme
so
well
la
fontaine
said
pelisson
tell
me
now
in
what
way
you
would
begin
my
prologue
i
should
say
for
instance
oh
nymph
who
after
who
i
should
place
a
verb
in
the
second
person
singular
of
the
present
indicative
and
should
go
on
thus
this
grot
profound
but
the
verb
the
verb
asked
pelisson
to
admire
the
greatest
king
of
all
kings
round
continued
la
fontaine
but
the
verb
the
verb
obstinately
insisted
pelisson
this
second
person
singular
of
the
present
indicative
well
then
quittest
oh
nymph
who
quittest
now
this
grot
profound
to
admire
the
greatest
king
of
all
kings
round
you
would
not
put
who
quittest
would
you
why
not
quittest
after
you
who
ah
my
dear
fellow
exclaimed
la
fontaine
you
are
a
shocking
pedant
without
counting
said
moliere
that
the
second
verse
king
of
all
kings
round
is
very
weak
my
dear
la
fontaine
then
you
see
clearly
i
am
nothing
but
a
poor
creaturea
shuffler
as
you
said
i
never
said
so
then
as
loret
said
and
it
was
not
loret
either
it
was
pelisson
well
pelisson
was
right
a
hundred
times
over
but
what
annoys
me
more
than
anything
my
dear
moliere
is
that
i
fear
we
shall
not
have
our
epicurean
dresses
you
expected
yours
then
for
the
fete
yes
for
the
fete
and
then
for
after
the
fete
my
housekeeper
told
me
that
my
own
is
rather
faded
diable
your
housekeeper
is
right
rather
more
than
faded
ah
you
see
resumed
la
fontaine
the
fact
is
i
left
it
on
the
floor
in
my
room
and
my
cat
well
your
cat
she
made
her
nest
upon
it
which
has
rather
changed
its
color
moliere
burst
out
laughing
pelisson
and
loret
followed
his
example
at
this
juncture
the
bishop
of
vannes
appeared
with
a
roll
of
plans
and
parchments
under
his
arm
as
if
the
angel
of
death
had
chilled
all
gay
and
sprightly
fanciesas
if
that
wan
form
had
scared
away
the
graces
to
whom
xenocrates
sacrificedsilence
immediately
reigned
through
the
study
and
every
one
resumed
his
selfpossession
and
his
pen
aramis
distributed
the
notes
of
invitation
and
thanked
them
in
the
name
of
m
fouquet
the
superintendent
he
said
being
kept
to
his
room
by
business
could
not
come
and
see
them
but
begged
them
to
send
him
some
of
the
fruits
of
their
days
work
to
enable
him
to
forget
the
fatigue
of
his
labor
in
the
night
at
these
words
all
settled
down
to
work
la
fontaine
placed
himself
at
a
table
and
set
his
rapid
pen
an
endless
dance
across
the
smooth
white
vellum
pelisson
made
a
fair
copy
of
his
prologue
moliere
contributed
fifty
fresh
verses
with
which
his
visit
to
percerin
had
inspired
him
loret
an
article
on
the
marvelous
fetes
he
predicted
and
aramis
laden
with
his
booty
like
the
king
of
the
bees
that
great
black
drone
decked
with
purple
and
gold
reentered
his
apartment
silent
and
busy
but
before
departing
remember
gentlemen
said
he
we
leave
tomorrow
evening
in
that
case
i
must
give
notice
at
home
said
moliere
yes
poor
moliere
said
loret
smiling
he
loves
his
home
he
loves
yes
replied
moliere
with
his
sad
sweet
smile
he
loves
that
does
not
mean
they
love
him
as
for
me
said
la
fontaine
they
love
me
at
chateau
thierry
i
am
very
sure
aramis
here
reentered
after
a
brief
disappearance
will
any
one
go
with
me
he
asked
i
am
going
by
paris
after
having
passed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
m
fouquet
i
offer
my
carriage
good
said
moliere
i
accept
it
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
shall
dine
here
said
loret
m
de
gourville
has
promised
me
some
crawfish
he
has
promised
me
some
whitings
find
a
rhyme
for
that
la
fontaine
aramis
went
out
laughing
as
only
he
could
laugh
and
moliere
followed
him
they
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
when
la
fontaine
opened
the
door
and
shouted
out
he
has
promised
us
some
whitings
in
return
for
these
our
writings
the
shouts
of
laughter
reached
the
ears
of
fouquet
at
the
moment
aramis
opened
the
door
of
the
study
as
to
moliere
he
had
undertaken
to
order
the
horses
while
aramis
went
to
exchange
a
parting
word
with
the
superintendent
oh
how
they
are
laughing
there
said
fouquet
with
a
sigh
do
you
not
laugh
monseigneur
i
laugh
no
longer
now
m
dherblay
the
fete
is
approaching
money
is
departing
have
i
not
told
you
that
was
my
business
yes
you
promised
me
millions
you
shall
have
them
the
day
after
the
kings
entree
into
vaux
fouquet
looked
closely
at
aramis
and
passed
the
back
of
his
icy
hand
across
his
moistened
brow
aramis
perceived
that
the
superintendent
either
doubted
him
or
felt
he
was
powerless
to
obtain
the
money
how
could
fouquet
suppose
that
a
poor
bishop
exabbe
exmusketeer
could
find
any
why
doubt
me
said
aramis
fouquet
smiled
and
shook
his
head
man
of
little
faith
added
the
bishop
my
dear
m
dherblay
answered
fouquet
if
i
fall
well
if
you
fall
i
shall
at
least
fall
from
such
a
height
that
i
shall
shatter
myself
in
falling
then
giving
himself
a
shake
as
though
to
escape
from
himself
whence
came
you
said
he
my
friend
from
parisfrom
percerin
and
what
have
you
been
doing
at
percerins
for
i
suppose
you
attach
no
great
importance
to
our
poets
dresses
no
i
went
to
prepare
a
surprise
surprise
yes
which
you
are
going
to
give
to
the
king
and
will
it
cost
much
oh
a
hundred
pistoles
you
will
give
lebrun
a
paintingah
all
the
better
and
what
is
this
painting
to
represent
i
will
tell
you
then
at
the
same
time
whatever
you
may
say
or
think
of
it
i
went
to
see
the
dresses
for
our
poets
bah
and
they
will
be
rich
and
elegant
splendid
there
will
be
few
great
monseigneurs
with
so
good
people
will
see
the
difference
there
is
between
the
courtiers
of
wealth
and
those
of
friendship
ever
generous
and
grateful
dear
prelate
in
your
school
fouquet
grasped
his
hand
and
where
are
you
going
he
said
i
am
off
to
paris
when
you
shall
have
given
a
certain
letter
for
whom
m
de
lyonne
and
what

want
with

i
wish
to

who
a

been
bastiled
these
ten
years
for

he
made
against
the
jesuits
two
latin
verses
and
for

committed
no

my
honor

his

it
is
too
bad
you
knew
this
and
you
never
told
me
twas
only
yesterday
his
mother
applied
to
me

and
the
woman

poor

the
deepest
misery

said
fouquet
sometimes
bears
with
such
injustice
on
earth
that
i
hardly
wonder
there
are
wretches
who
doubt
of
its
existence
stay
m
dherblay
and
fouquet
taking
a
pen
wrote
a
few
rapid
lines
to
his
colleague
lyonne
aramis
took
the
letter
and
made
ready
to
go
wait
said
fouquet
he
opened
his
drawer
and
took
out
ten
government
notes
which
were
there
each
for
a
thousand
francs
stay
he
said
set
the
son
at
liberty
and
give
this
to
the
mother
but
above
all
do
not
tell
her
what
monseigneur
that
she
is
ten
thousand
livres
richer
than

she
would
say
i
am

go
and
i
pray
that
god
will
bless
those
who
are
mindful
of
his
poor
so
also
do
i
pray
replied
aramis
kissing
fouquets
hand
and
he
went
out
quickly
carrying
off
the
letter
for
lyonne
and
the
notes
for
seldons

and
the
delicacy

who
booted
like
a

dressed
in

again
a
little
touch
of
the
musketeer
about
him
the
bishop
just
trenched
on
the
borders
only
of
license
in
his
style
of
conversation
as
for
m
de
baisemeaux
with
the
facility
of
vulgar
people
he
gave
himself
up
entirely
upon
this
point
of
his
guests
freedom
monsieur
said
he
for
indeed
tonight
i
dare
not
call
you
monseigneur
by
no
means
said
aramis
call
me
monsieur
i
am
booted
do
you
know
monsieur
of
whom
you
remind
me
this
evening
no
faith
said
aramis
taking
up
his
glass
but
i
hope
i
remind
you
of
a
capital
guest
you
remind
me
of
two
monsieur
francois
shut
the
window
the
wind
may
annoy
his
greatness
and
let
him
go
added
aramis
the
supper
is
completely
served
and
we
shall
eat
it
very
well
without
waiters
i
like
exceedingly
to
be
teteatete
when
i
am
with
a
friend
baisemeaux
bowed
respectfully
i
like
exceedingly
continued
aramis
to
help
myself
retire
francois
cried
baisemeaux
i
was
saying
that
your
greatness
puts
me
in
mind
of
two
persons
one
very
illustrious
the
late
cardinal
the
great
cardinal
de
la
rochelle
who
wore
boots
like
you
indeed
said
aramis
and
the
other
the
other
was
a
certain
musketeer
very
handsome
very
brave
very
adventurous
very
fortunate
who
from
being
abbe
turned
musketeer
and
from
musketeer
turned
abbe
aramis
condescended
to
smile
from
abbe
continued
baisemeaux
encouraged
by
aramiss
smilefrom
abbe
bishopand
from
bishop
ah
stay
there
i
beg
exclaimed
aramis
i
have
just
said
monsieur
that
you
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
cardinal
enough
dear
m
baisemeaux
as
you
said
i
have
on
the
boots
of
a
cavalier
but
i
do
not
intend
for
all
that
to
embroil
myself
with
the
church
this
evening
but
you
have
wicked
intentions
nevertheless
monseigneur
oh
yes
wicked
i
own
as
everything
mundane
is
you
traverse
the
town
and
the
streets
in
disguise
in
disguise
as
you
say
and
you
still
make
use
of
your
sword
yes
i
should
think
so
but
only
when
i
am
compelled
do
me
the
pleasure
to
summon
francois
have
you
no
wine
there
tis
not
for
wine
but
because
it
is
hot
here
and
the
window
is
shut
i
shut
the
windows
at
suppertime
so
as
not
to
hear
the
sounds
or
the
arrival
of
couriers
ah
yes
you
hear
them
when
the
window
is
open
but
too
well
and
that
disturbs
me
you
understand
nevertheless
i
am
suffocated
francois
francois
entered
open
the
windows
i
pray
you
master
francois
said
aramis
you
will
allow
him
dear
m
baisemeaux
you
are
at
home
here
answered
the
governor
the
window
was
opened
do
you
not
think
said
m
de
baisemeaux
that
you
will
find
yourself
very
lonely
now
m
de
la
fere
has
returned
to
his
household
gods
at
blois
he
is
a
very
old
friend
is
he
not
you
know
it
as
i
do
baisemeaux
seeing
that
you
were
in
the
musketeers
with
us
bah
with
my
friends
i
reckon
neither
bottles
of
wine
nor
years
and
you
are
right
but
i
do
more
than
love
m
de
la
fere
dear
baisemeaux
i
venerate
him
well
for
my
part
though
tis
singular
said
the
governor
i
prefer
m
dartagnan
to
him
there
is
a
man
for
you
who
drinks
long
and
well
that
kind
of
people
allow
you
at
least
to
penetrate
their
thoughts
baisemeaux
make
me
tipsy
tonight
let
us
have
a
merry
time
of
it
as
of
old
and
if
i
have
a
trouble
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
promise
you
you
shall
see
it
as
you
would
a
diamond
at
the
bottom
of
your
glass
bravo
said
baisemeaux
and
he
poured
out
a
great
glass
of
wine
and
drank
it
off
at
a
draught
trembling
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
being
by
hook
or
by
crook
in
the
secret
of
some
high
archiepiscopal
misdemeanor
while
he
was
drinking
he
did
not
see
with
what
attention
aramis
was
noting
the
sounds
in
the
great
court
a
courier
came
in
about
eight
oclock
as
francois
brought
in
the
fifth
bottle
and
although
the
courier
made
a
great
noise
baisemeaux
heard
nothing
the
devil
take
him
said
aramis
what
who
asked
baisemeaux
i
hope
tis
neither
the
wine
you
drank
nor
he
who
is
the
cause
of
your
drinking
it
no
it
is
a
horse
who
is
making
noise
enough
in
the
court
for
a
whole
squadron
pooh
some
courier
or
other
replied
the
governor
redoubling
his
attention
to
the
passing
bottle
yes
and
may
the
devil
take
him
and
so
quickly
that
we
shall
never
hear
him
speak
more
hurrah
hurrah
you
forget
me
baisemeaux
my
glass
is
empty
said
aramis
lifting
his
dazzling
venetian
goblet
upon
my
honor
you
delight
me
francois
wine
francois
entered
wine
fellow
and
better
yes
monsieur
yes
but
a
courier
has
just
arrived
let
him
go
to
the
devil
i
say
yes
monsieur
but
let
him
leave
his
news
at
the
office
we
will
see
to
it
tomorrow
tomorrow
there
will
be
time
tomorrow
there
will
be
daylight
said
baisemeaux
chanting
the
words
ah
monsieur
grumbled
the
soldier
francois
in
spite
of
himself
monsieur
take
care
said
aramis
take
care
of
what
dear
m
dherblay
said
baisemeaux
half
intoxicated
the
letter
which
the
courier
brings
to
the
governor
of
a
fortress
is
sometimes
an
order
nearly
always
do
not
orders
issue
from
the
ministers
yes
undoubtedly
but
and
what
to
these
ministers
do
but
countersign
the
signature
of
the
king
perhaps
you
are
right
nevertheless
tis
very
tiresome
when
you
are
sitting
before
a
good
table
teteatete
with
a
friendah
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
i
forgot
it
is
i
who
engage
you
at
supper
and
that
i
speak
to
a
future
cardinal
let
us
pass
over
that
dear
baisemeaux
and
return
to
our
soldier
to
francois
well
and
what
has
francois
done
he
has
demurred
he
was
wrong
then
however
he
has
demurred
you
see
tis
because
there
is
something
extraordinary
in
this
matter
it
is
very
possible
that
it
was
not
francois
who
was
wrong
in
demurring
but
you
who
are
in
the
wrong
in
not
listening
to
him
wrong
i
to
be
wrong
before
francois
that
seems
rather
hard
pardon
me
merely
an
irregularity
but
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
make
an
observation
which
i
deem
important
oh
perhaps
you
are
right
stammered
baisemeaux
the
kings
order
is
sacred
but
as
to
orders
that
arrive
when
one
is
at
supper
i
repeat
that
the
devil
if
you
had
said
as
much
to
the
great
cardinalhem
my
dear
baisemeaux
and
if
his
order
had
any
importance
i
do
it
that
i
may
not
disturb
a
bishop
mordioux
am
i
not
then
excusable
do
not
forget
baisemeaux
that
i
have
worn
the
soldiers
coat
and
i
am
accustomed
to
obedience
everywhere
you
wish
then
i
wish
that
you
would
do
your
duty
my
friend
yes
at
least
before
this
soldier
tis
mathematically
true
exclaimed
baisemeaux
francois
still
waited
let
them
send
this
order
of
the
kings
up
to
me
he
repeated
recovering
himself
and
he
added
in
a
low
tone
do
you
know
what
it
is
i
will
tell
you
something
about
as
interesting
as
this
beware
of
fire
near
the
powder
magazine
or
look
close
after
such
and
such
a
one
who
is
clever
at
escaping
ah
if
you
only
knew
monseigneur
how
many
times
i
have
been
suddenly
awakened
from
the
very
sweetest
deepest
slumber
by
messengers
arriving
at
full
gallop
to
tell
me
or
rather
bring
me
a
slip
of
paper
containing
these
words
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
what
news
tis
clear
enough
that
those
who
waste
their
time
writing
such
orders
have
never
slept
in
the
bastile
they
would
know
better
they
have
never
considered
the
thickness
of
my
walls
the
vigilance
of
my
officers
the
number
of
rounds
we
go
but
indeed
what
can
you
expect
monseigneur
it
is
their
business
to
write
and
torment
me
when
i
am
at
rest
and
to
trouble
me
when
i
am
happy
added
baisemeaux
bowing
to
aramis
then
let
them
do
their
business
and
do
you
do
yours
added
the
bishop
smiling
francois
reentered
baisemeaux
took
from
his
hands
the
ministers
order
he
slowly
undid
it
and
as
slowly
read
it
aramis
pretended
to
be
drinking
so
as
to
be
able
to
watch
his
host
through
the
glass
then
baisemeaux
having
read
it
what
was
i
just
saying
he
exclaimed
what
is
it
asked
the
bishop
an
order
of
release
there
now
excellent
news
indeed
to
disturb
us
excellent
news
for
him
whom
it
concerns
you
will
at
least
agree
my
dear
governor
and
at
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
it
is
charitable
oh
charity
is
all
very
well
but
it
is
for
that
fellow
who
says
he
is
so
weary
and
tired
but
not
for
me
who
am
amusing
myself
said
baisemeaux
exasperated
will
you
lose
by
him
then
and
is
the
prisoner
who
is
to
be
set
at
liberty
a
good
payer
oh
yes
indeed
a
miserable
fivefranc
rat
let
me
see
it
asked
m
dherblay
it
is
no
indiscretion
by
no
means
read
it
there
is
urgent
on
the
paper
you
have
seen
that
i
suppose
oh
admirable
urgenta
man
who
has
been
there
ten
years
it
is
urgent
to
set
him
free
today
this
very
evening
at
eight
oclockurgent
and
baisemeaux
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
supreme
disdain
flung
the
order
on
the
table
and
began
eating
again
they
are
fond
of
these
tricks
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
they
seize
a
man
some
fine
day
keep
him
under
lock
and
key
for
ten
years
and
write
to
you
watch
this
fellow
well
or
keep
him
very
strictly
and
then
as
soon
as
you
are
accustomed
to
look
upon
the
prisoner
as
a
dangerous
man
all
of
a
sudden
without
rhyme
or
reason
they
writeset
him
at
liberty
and
actually
add
to
their
missiveurgent
you
will
own
my
lord
tis
enough
to
make
a
man
at
dinner
shrug
his
shoulders
what
do
you
expect
it
is
for
them
to
write
said
aramis
for
you
to
execute
the
order
good
good
execute
it
oh
patience
you
must
not
imagine
that
i
am
a
slave
gracious
heaven
my
very
good
m
baisemeaux
who
ever
said
so
your
independence
is
well
known
thank
heaven
but
your
goodness
of
heart
is
also
known
ah
dont
speak
of
it
and
your
obedience
to
your
superiors
once
a
soldier
you
see
baisemeaux
always
a
soldier
and
i
shall
directly
obey
and
tomorrow
morning
at
daybreak
the
prisoner
referred
to
shall
be
set
free
tomorrow
at
dawn
why
not
this
evening
seeing
that
the
lettre
de
cachet
bears
both
on
the
direction
and
inside
urgent
because
this
evening
we
are
at
supper
and
our
affairs
are
urgent
too
dear
baisemeaux
booted
though
i
be
i
feel
myself
a
priest
and
charity
has
higher
claims
upon
me
than
hunger
and
thirst
this
unfortunate
man
has
suffered
long
enough
since
you
have
just
told
me
that
he
has
been
your
prisoner
these
ten
years
abridge
his
suffering
his
good
time
has
come
give
him
the
benefit
quickly
god
will
repay
you
in
paradise
with
years
of
felicity
you
wish
it
i
entreat
you
what
in
the
very
middle
of
our
repast
i
implore
you
such
an
action
is
worth
ten
benedicites
it
shall
be
as
you
desire
only
our
supper
will
get
cold
oh
never
heed
that
baisemeaux
leaned
back
to
ring
for
francois
and
by
a
very
natural
motion
turned
round
towards
the
door
the
order
had
remained
on
the
table
aramis
seized
the
opportunity
when
baisemeaux
was
not
looking
to
change
the
paper
for
another
folded
in
the
same
manner
which
he
drew
swiftly
from
his
pocket

the

let
the
major
come
up
here
with
the
turnkeys

quitted

companions
alone

general
of
the
order
there
was
now
a
brief
silence
during
which
aramis
never
removed
his
eyes
from
baisemeaux
for
a
moment
the
latter
seemed
only
half
decided
to
disturb
himself
thus
in
the
middle
of
supper
and
it
was
clear
he
was
trying
to
invent
some
pretext
whether
good
or
bad
for
delay
at
any
rate
till
after
dessert
and
it
appeared
also
that
he
had
hit
upon
an
excuse
at
last
eh
but
it
is
impossible
he
cried
how
impossible
said
aramis
give
me
a
glimpse
of
this
impossibility
tis
impossible
to
set
a
prisoner
at
liberty
at
such
an
hour
where
can
he
go
to
a
man
so
unacquainted
with
paris
he
will
find
a
place
wherever
he
can
you
see
now
one
might
as
well
set
a
blind
man
free
i
have
a
carriage
and
will
take
him
wherever
he
wishes
you
have
an
answer
for
everything
francois
tell
monsieur
le
major
to
go
and
open
the
cell
of
m
seldon
no
3
bertaudiere
seldon
exclaimed
aramis
very
naturally
you
said
seldon
i
think
i
said
seldon
of
course
tis
the
name
of
the
man
they
set
free
oh
you
mean
to
say
marchiali
said
aramis
marchiali
oh
yes
indeed
no
no
seldon
i
think
you
are
making
a
mistake
monsieur
baisemeaux
i
have
read
the
order
and
i
also
and
i
saw
seldon
in
letters
as
large
as
that
and
baisemeaux
held
up
his
finger
and
i
read
marchiali
in
characters
as
large
as
this
said
aramis
also
holding
up
two
fingers
to
the
proof
let
us
throw
a
light
on
the
matter
said
baisemeaux
confident
he
was
right
there
is
the
paper
you
have
only
to
read
it
i
read
marchiali
returned
aramis
spreading
out
the
paper
look
baisemeaux
looked
and
his
arms
dropped
suddenly
yes
yes
he
said
quite
overwhelmed
yes
marchiali
tis
plainly
written
marchiali
quite
true
ah
how
the
man
of
whom
we
have
talked
so
much
the
man
whom
they
are
every
day
telling
me
to
take
such
care
of
there
is
marchiali
repeated
the
inflexible
aramis
i
must
own
it
monseigneur
but
i
understand
nothing
about
it
you
believe
your
eyes
at
any
rate
to
tell
me
very
plainly
there
is
marchiali
and
in
a
good
handwriting
too
tis
a
wonder
i
still
see
this
order
and
the
name
of
seldon
irishman
i
see
it
ah
i
even
recollect
that
under
this
name
there
was
a
blot
of
ink
no
there
is
no
ink
no
there
is
no
blot
oh
but
there
was
though
i
know
it
because
i
rubbed
my
fingerthis
very
onein
the
powder
that
was
over
the
blot
in
a
word
be
it
how
it
may
dear
m
baisemeaux
said
aramis
and
whatever
you
may
have
seen
the
order
is
signed
to
release
marchiali
blot
or
no
blot
the
order
is
signed
to
release
marchiali
replied
baisemeaux
mechanically
endeavoring
to
regain
his
courage
and
you
are
going
to
release
this
prisoner
if
your
heart
dictates
you
to
deliver
seldon
also
i
declare
to
you
i
will
not
oppose
it
the
least
in
the
world
aramis
accompanied
this
remark
with
a
smile
the
irony
of
which
effectually
dispelled
baisemeauxs
confusion
of
mind
and
restored
his
courage
monseigneur
he
said
this
marchiali
is
the
very
same
prisoner
whom
the
other
day
a
priest
confessor
of
our
order
came
to
visit
in
so
imperious
and
so
secret
a
manner
i
dont
know
that
monsieur
replied
the
bishop
tis
no
such
long
time
ago
dear
monsieur
dherblay
it
is
true
but
with
us
monsieur
it
is
good
that
the
man
of
today
should
no
longer
know
what
the
man
of
yesterday
did
in
any
case
said
baisemeaux
the
visit
of
the
jesuit
confessor
must
have
given
happiness
to
this
man
aramis
made
no
reply
but
recommenced
eating
and
drinking
as
for
baisemeaux
no
longer
touching
anything
that
was
on
the
table
he
again
took
up
the
order
and
examined
it
every
way
this
investigation
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
made
the
ears
of
the
impatient
aramis
burn
with
anger
but
the
bishop
of
vannes
did
not
become
incensed
for
so
little
above
all
when
he
had
murmured
to
himself
that
to
do
so
was
dangerous
are
you
going
to
release
marchiali
he
said
what
mellow
fragrant
and
delicious
sherry
this
is
my
dear
governor
monseigneur
replied
baisemeaux
i
shall
release
the
prisoner
marchiali
when
i
have
summoned
the
courier
who
brought
the
order
and
above
all
when
by
interrogating
him
i
have
satisfied
myself
the
order
is
sealed
and
the
courier
is
ignorant
of
the
contents
what
do
you
want
to
satisfy
yourself
about
be
it
so
monseigneur
but
i
shall
send
to
the
ministry
and
m
de
lyonne
will
either
confirm
or
withdraw
the
order
what
is
the
good
of
all
that
asked
aramis
coldly
what
good
yes
what
is
your
object
i
ask
the
object
of
never
deceiving
oneself
monseigneur
nor
being
wanting
in
the
respect
which
a
subaltern
owes
to
his
superior
officers
nor
infringing
the
duties
of
a
service
one
has
accepted
of
ones
own
free
will
very
good
you
have
just
spoken
so
eloquently
that
i
cannot
but
admire
you
it
is
true
that
a
subaltern
owes
respect
to
his
superiors
he
is
guilty
when
he
deceives
himself
and
he
should
be
punished
if
he
infringed
either
the
duties
or
laws
of
his
office
baisemeaux
looked
at
the
bishop
with
astonishment
it
follows
pursued
aramis
that
you
are
going
to
ask
advice
to
put
your
conscience
at
ease
in
the
matter
yes
monseigneur
and
if
a
superior
officer
gives
you
orders
you
will
obey
never
doubt
it
monseigneur
you
know
the
kings
signature
well
m
de
baisemeaux
yes
monseigneur
is
it
not
on
this
order
of
release
it
is
true
but
it
may
be
forged
you
mean
that
is
evident
monseigneur
you
are
right
and
that
of
m
de
lyonne
i
see
it
plain
enough
on
the
order
but
for
the
same
reason
that
the
kings
signature
may
have
been
forged
so
also
and
with
even
greater
probability
may
m
de
lyonnes
your
logic
has
the
stride
of
a
giant
m
de
baisemeaux
said
aramis
and
your
reasoning
is
irresistible
but
on
what
special
grounds
do
you
base
your
idea
that
these
signatures
are
false
on
this
the
absence
of
countersignatures
nothing
checks
his
majestys
signature
and
m
de
lyonne
is
not
there
to
tell
me
he
has
signed
well
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
said
aramis
bending
an
eagle
glance
on
the
governor
i
adopt
so
frankly
your
doubts
and
your
mode
of
clearing
them
up
that
i
will
take
a
pen
if
you
will
give
me
one
baisemeaux
gave
him
a
pen
and
a
sheet
of
white
paper
added
aramis
baisemeaux
handed
him
some
paper
now
ii
alsoi
here
presentincontestably
iam
going
to
write
an
order
to
which
i
am
certain
you
will
give
credence
incredulous
as
you
are
baisemeaux
turned
pale
at
this
icy
assurance
of
manner
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
voice
of
the
bishops
but
just
now
so
playful
and
gay
had
become
funereal
and
sad
that
the
wax
lights
changed
into
the
tapers
of
a
mortuary
chapel
the
very
glasses
of
wine
into
chalices
of
blood
aramis
took
a
pen
and
wrote
baisemeaux
in
terror
read
over
his
shoulder
a
m
d
g
wrote
the
bishop
and
he
drew
a
cross
under
these
four
letters
which
signify
ad
majorem
dei
gloriam
to
the
greater
glory
of
god
and
thus
he
continued
it
is
our
pleasure
that
the
order
brought
to
m
de
baisemeaux
de
montlezun
governor
for
the
king
of
the
castle
of
the
bastile

held
by
him
good
and
effectual
and
be
immediately
carried
into
operation
signed
dherblay
general
of
the
order
by
the
grace
of
god
baisemeaux
was
so
profoundly
astonished
that
his
features
remained
contracted
his
lips
parted
and
his
eyes
fixed
he
did
not
move
an
inch
nor
articulate
a
sound
nothing
could
be
heard
in
that
large
chamber
but
the
wingwhisper
of
a
little
moth
which
was
fluttering
to
its
death
about
the
candles
aramis
without
even
deigning
to
look
at
the
man
whom
he
had
reduced
to
so
miserable
a
condition
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
case
of
black
wax
he
sealed
the
letter
and
stamped
it
with
a
seal
suspended
at
his
breast
beneath
his
doublet
and
when
the
operation
was
concluded
presentedstill
in
silencethe
missive
to
m
de
baisemeaux
the
latter
whose
hands
trembled
in
a
manner
to
excite
pity
turned
a
dull
and
meaningless
gaze
upon
the
letter
a
last
gleam
of
feeling
played
over
his
features
and
he
fell
as
if
thunderstruck
on
a
chair
come
come
said
aramis
after
a
long
silence
during
which
the
governor
of
the
bastile
had
slowly
recovered
his
senses
do
not
lead
me
to
believe
dear
baisemeaux
that
the
presence
of
the
general
of
the
order
is
as
terrible
as
his
and
that
men
die
merely
from
having
seen
him
take
courage
rouse
yourself
give
me
your
handobey
baisemeaux
reassured
if
not
satisfied
obeyed
kissed
aramiss
hand
and
rose
immediately
he
murmured
oh
there
is
no
pressing
haste
my
host
take
your
place
again
and
do
the
honors
over
this
beautiful
dessert
monseigneur
i
shall
never
recover
such
a
shock
as
this
i
who
have
laughed
who
have
jested
with
you
i
who
have
dared
to
treat
you
on
a
footing
of
equality
say
nothing
about
it
old
comrade
replied
the
bishop
who
perceived
how
strained
the
cord
was
and
how
dangerous
it
would
have
been
to
break
it
say
nothing
about
it
let
us
each
live
in
our
own
way
to
you
my
protection
and
my
friendship
to
me
your
obedience
having
exactly
fulfilled
these
two
requirements
let
us
live
happily
baisemeaux
reflected
he
perceived
at
a
glance
the
consequence
of
this
withdrawal
of
a
prisoner
by
means
of
a
forged
order
and
putting
in
the
scale
the
guarantee
offered
him
by
the
official
order
of
the
general
did
not
consider
it
of
any
value
aramis
divined
this
my
dear
baisemeaux
said
he
you
are
a
simpleton
lose
this
habit
of
reflection
when
i
give
myself
the
trouble
to
think
for
you
and
at
another
gesture
he
made
baisemeaux
bowed
again
how
shall
i
set
about
it
he
said
what
is
the
process
for
releasing
a
prisoner
i
have
the
regulations
well
then
follow
the
regulations
my
friend
i
go
with
my
major
to
the
prisoners
room
and
conduct
him
if
he
is
a
personage
of
importance
but
this
marchiali
is
not
an
important
personage
said
aramis
carelessly
i
dont
know
answered
the
governor
as
if
he
would
have
said
it
is
for
you
to
instruct
me
then
if
you
dont
know
it
i
am
right
so
act
towards
marchiali
as
you
act
towards
one
of
obscure
station
good
the
regulations
so
provide
they
are
to
the
effect
that
the
turnkey
or
one
of
the
lower
officials
shall
bring
the
prisoner
before
the
governor
in
the
office
well
tis
very
wise
that
and
then
then
we
return
to
the
prisoner
the
valuables
he
wore
at
the
time
of
his
imprisonment
his
clothes
and
papers
if
the
ministers
orders
have
not
otherwise
dictated
what
was
the
ministers
order
as
to
this
marchiali
nothing
for
the
unhappy
man
arrived
here
without
jewels
without
papers
and
almost
without
clothes
see
how
simple
then
all
is
indeed
baisemeaux
you
make
a
mountain
of
everything
remain
here
and
make
them
bring
the
prisoner
to
the
governors
house
baisemeaux
obeyed
he
summoned
his
lieutenant
and
gave
him
an
order
which
the
latter
passed
on
without
disturbing
himself
about
it
to
the
next
whom
it
concerned
half
an
hour
afterwards
they
heard
a
gate
shut
in
the
court
it
was
the
door
to
the
dungeon
which
had
just
rendered
up
its
prey
to
the
free
air
aramis
blew
out
all
the
candles
which
lighted
the
room
but
one
which
he
left
burning
behind
the
door
this

to

the
governor
obeyed
the
sergeant
and
turnkeys
disappeared
baisemeaux
reentered
followed
by
a
prisoner
aramis
had
placed
himself
in
the
shade
he
saw
without
being
seen
baisemeaux
in
an
agitated
tone
of
voice
made
the
young
man
acquainted
with
the
order
which
set
him
at
liberty
the
prisoner
listened
without
making
a
single
gesture
or
saying
a
word
you
will
swear
tis
the
regulation
that
requires
it
added
the
governor
never
to
reveal
anything
that
you
have
seen
or
heard
in
the
bastile
the
prisoner
perceived
a
crucifix
he
stretched
out
his
hands
and
swore
with
his
lips
and
now
monsieur
you
are
free
whither
do
you
intend
going
the
prisoner
turned
his
head
as
if
looking
behind
him
for
some
protection
on
which
he
ought
to
rely
then
was
it
that
aramis
came
out
of
the
shade
i
am
here
he
said
to
render
the
gentleman
whatever
service
he
may
please
to
ask
the
prisoner
slightly
reddened
and
without
hesitation
passed
his
arm
through
that
of
aramis
god
have
you
in
his
holy
keeping
he
said
in
a
voice
the
firmness
of
which
made
the
governor
tremble
as
much
as
the
form
of
the
blessing
astonished
him
aramis
on
shaking
hands
with
baisemeaux
said
to
him
does
my
order
trouble
you
do
you
fear
their
finding
it
here
should
they
come
to
search
i
desire
to
keep
it
monseigneur
said
baisemeaux
if
they
found
it
here
it
would
be
a
certain
indication
i
should
be
lost
and
in
that
case
you
would
be
a
powerful
and
a
last
auxiliary
for
me
being
your
accomplice
you
mean
answered
aramis
shrugging
his
shoulders
adieu
baisemeaux
said
he
the
horses
were
in
waiting
making
each
rusty
spring
reverberate
the
carriage
again
with
their
impatience
baisemeaux
accompanied
the
bishop
to
the
bottom
of
the
steps
aramis
caused
his
companion
to
mount
before
him
then
followed
and
without
giving
the
driver
any
further
order
go
on
said
he
the
carriage
rattled
over
the
pavement
of
the
courtyard
an
officer
with
a
torch
went
before
the
horses
and
gave
orders
at
every
post
to
let
them
pass
during
the
time
taken
in
opening
all
the
barriers
aramis
barely
breathed
and
you
might
have
heard
his
sealed
heart
knock
against
his
ribs
the
prisoner
buried
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
made
no
more
sign
of
life
than
his
companion
at
length
a
jolt
more
sever
than
the
others
announced
to
them
that
they
had
cleared
the
last
watercourse
behind
the
carriage
closed
the
last
gate
that
in
the
rue
st
antoine
no
more
walls
either
on
the
right
or
the
left
heaven
everywhere
liberty
everywhere
and
life
everywhere
the
horses
kept
in
check
by
a
vigorous
hand
went
quietly
as
far
as
the
middle
of
the
faubourg
there
they
began
to
trot
little
by
little
whether
they
were
warming
to
their
work
or
whether
they
were
urged
they
gained
in
swiftness
and
once
past
bercy
the
carriage
seemed
to
fly
so
great
was
the
ardor
of
the
coursers
the
horses
galloped
thus
as
far
as
villeneuve
st
georges
where
relays
were
waiting
then
four
instead
of
two
whirled
the
carriage
away
in
the
direction
of
melun
and
pulled
up
for
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
of
senart
no
doubt
the
order
had
been
given
the
postilion
beforehand
for
aramis
had
no
occasion
even
to
make
a
sign
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
prisoner
as
if
waking
from
a
long
dream
the
matter
is
monseigneur
said
aramis
that
before
going
further
it
is
necessary
your
royal
highness
and
i
should
converse
i
will
await
an
opportunity
monsieur
answered
the
young
prince
we
could
not
have
a
better
monseigneur
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
forest
and
no
one
can
hear
us
the
postilion
the
postilion
of
this
relay
is
deaf
and
dumb
monseigneur
i
am
at
your
service
m
dherblay
is
it
your
pleasure
to
remain
in
the
carriage
yes
we
are
comfortably
seated
and
i
like
this
carriage
for
it
has
restored
me
to
liberty
wait
monseigneur
there
is
yet
a
precaution
to
be
taken
what
we
are
here
on
the
highway
cavaliers
or
carriages
traveling
like
ourselves
might
pass
and
seeing
us
stopping
deem
us
in
some
difficulty
let
us
avoid
offers
of
assistance
which
would
embarrass
us
give
the
postilion
orders
to
conceal
the
carriage
in
one
of
the
side
avenues
tis
exactly
what
i
wished
to
do
monseigneur
aramis
made
a
sign
to
the
deaf
and
dumb
driver
of
the
carriage
whom
he
touched
on
the
arm
the
latter
dismounted
took
the
leaders
by
the
bridle
and
led
them
over
the
velvet
sward
and
the
mossy
grass
of
a
winding
alley
at
the
bottom
of
which
on
this
moonless
night
the
deep
shades
formed
a
curtain
blacker
than
ink
this
done
the
man
lay
down
on
a
slope
near
his
horses
who
on
either
side
kept
nibbling
the
young
oak
shoots
i
am
listening
said
the
young
prince
to
aramis
but
what
are
you
doing
there
i
am
disarming
myself
of
my
pistols
of
which
we
have
no
further
need

the
tempter
my
prince
said
aramis
turning
in
the
carriage
towards
his
companion
weak
creature
as
i
am
so
unpretending
in
genius
so
low
in
the
scale
of
intelligent
beings
it
has
never
yet
happened
to
me
to
converse
with
a
man
without
penetrating
his
thoughts
through
that
living
mask
which
has
been
thrown
over
our
mind
in
order
to
retain
its
expression
but
tonight
in
this
darkness
in
the
reserve
which
you
maintain
i
can
read
nothing
on
your
features
and
something
tells
me
that
i
shall
have
great
difficulty
in
wresting
from
you
a
sincere
declaration
i
beseech
you
then
not
for
love
of
me
for
subjects
should
never
weigh
as
anything
in
the
balance
which
princes
hold
but
for
love
of
yourself
to
retain
every
syllable
every
inflexion
which
under
the
present
most
grave
circumstances
will
all
have
a
sense
and
value
as
important
as
any
every
uttered
in
the
world
i
listen
replied
the
young
prince
decidedly
without
either
eagerly
seeking
or
fearing
anything
you
are
about
to
say
to
me
and
he
buried
himself
still
deeper
in
the
thick
cushions
of
the
carriage
trying
to
deprive
his
companion
not
only
of
the
sight
of
him
but
even
of
the
very
idea
of
his
presence
black
was
the
darkness
which
fell
wide
and
dense
from
the
summits
of
the
intertwining
trees
the
carriage
covered
in
by
this
prodigious
roof
would
not
have
received
a
particle
of
light
not
even
if
a
ray
could
have
struggled
through
the
wreaths
of
mist
that
were
already
rising
in
the
avenue
monseigneur
resumed
aramis
you
know
the
history
of
the
government
which
today
controls
france
the
king
issued
from
an
infancy
imprisoned
like
yours
obscure
as
yours
and
confined
as
yours
only
instead
of
ending
like
yourself
this
slavery
in
a
prison
this
obscurity
in
solitude
these
straightened
circumstances
in
concealment
he
was
fain
to
bear
all
these
miseries
humiliations
and
distresses
in
full
daylight
under
the
pitiless
sun
of
royalty
on
an
elevation
flooded
with
light
where
every
stain
appears
a
blemish
every
glory
a
stain
the
king
has
suffered
it
rankles
in
his
mind
and
he
will
avenge
himself
he
will
be
a
bad
king
i
say
not
that
he
will
pour
out
his
peoples
blood
like
louis
xi
or
charles
ix
for
he
has
no
mortal
injuries
to
avenge
but
he
will
devour
the
means
and
substance
of
his
people
for
he
has
himself
undergone
wrongs
in
his
own
interest
and
money
in
the
first
place
then
i
acquit
my
conscience
when
i
consider
openly
the
merits
and
the
faults
of
this
great
prince
and
if
i
condemn
him
my
conscience
absolves
me
aramis
paused
it
was
not
to
listen
if
the
silence
of
the
forest
remained
undisturbed
but
it
was
to
gather
up
his
thoughts
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
soulto
leave
the
thoughts
he
had
uttered
sufficient
time
to
eat
deeply
into
the
mind
of
his
companion
all
that
heaven
does
heaven
does
well
continued
the
bishop
of
vannes
and
i
am
so
persuaded
of
it
that
i
have
long
been
thankful
to
have
been
chosen
depositary
of
the
secret

i

at
the

under

were
dealing

monseigneur
king

people
very
humble
much
disinherited
humble
because
they
have
no

never

for
an
abstract
idea
they
heap
together
all
the
atoms
of
their
power
so
from
a
single
man
and
round
this
man
with
the
sweat
of
their
labor
they
create
a
misty
halo
which
his
genius
shall
in
turn
render
a
glory
gilded
with
the
rays
of
all
the
crowns
in

such
is
the
man
you
have
beside
you
monseigneur
it
is
to
tell
you
that
he
has
drawn
you
from

not

judge

are
about
to
become
those
of
your
triumphant
restoration
tomorrow
after
tomorrowfrom
the
very
first
regal
phantom
living
shade
of
louis
xiv
you
will
sit
upon
his
throne
whence
the
will
of
heaven
confided
in
execution
to
the
arm
of
man
will
have
hurled
him
without
hope
of
return
i
understand
said
the
prince
my
brothers
blood
will
not
be
shed
then
you
will
be
sole
arbiter
of
his
fate
the
secret
of
which
they
made
an
evil
use
against
me
you
will
employ
it
against
him
what
did
he
do
to
conceal
it
he
concealed
you
living
image
of
himself
you
will
defeat
the
conspiracy
of
mazarin
and
anne
of
austria
you
my
prince
will
have
the
same
interest
in
concealing
him
who
will
as
a
prisoner
resemble
you
as
you
will
resemble
him
as
a
king
i
fall
back
on
what
i
was
saying
to
you
who
will
guard
him
who
guarded
you
you
know
this
secretyou
have
made
use
of
it
with
regard
to
myself
who
else
knows
it
the
queenmother
and
madame
de
chevreuse
what
will
they
do
nothing
if
you
choose
how
is
that
how
can
they
recognize
you
if
you
act
in
such
a
manner
that
no
one
can
recognize
you
tis
true
but
there
are
grave
difficulties
state
them
prince
my
brother
is
married
i
cannot
take
my
brothers
wife
i
will
cause
spain
to
consent
to
a
divorce
it
is
in
the
interest
of
your
new
policy
it
is
human
morality
all
that
is
really
noble
and
really
useful
in
this
world
will
find
its
account
therein
the
imprisoned
king
will
speak
to
whom
do
you
think
he
will
speakto
the
walls
you
mean
by
walls
the
men
in
whom
you
put
confidence
if
need
be
yes
and
besides
your
royal
highness
besides
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
designs
of
providence
do
not
stop
on
such
a
fair
road
every
scheme
of
this
caliber
is
completed
by
its
results
like
a
geometrical
calculation
the
king
in
prison
will
not
be
for
you
the
cause
of
embarrassment
that
you
have
been
for
the
king
enthroned
his
soul
is
naturally
proud
and
impatient
it
is
moreover
disarmed
and
enfeebled
by
being
accustomed
to
honors
and
by
the
license
of
supreme
power
the
same
providence
which
has
willed
that
the
concluding
step
in
the
geometrical
calculation
i
have
had
the
honor
of
describing
to
your
royal
highness
should
be
your
ascension
to
the
throne
and
the
destruction
of
him
who
is
hurtful
to
you
has
also
determined
that
the
conquered
one
shall
soon
end
both
his
own
and
your
sufferings
therefore
his
soul
and
body
have
been
adapted
for
but
a
brief
agony
put
into
prison
as
a
private
individual
left
alone
with
your
doubts
deprived
of
everything
you
have
exhibited
the
most
sublime
enduring
principle
of
life
in
withstanding
all
this
but
your
brother
a
captive
forgotten
and
in
bonds
will
not
long
endure
the
calamity
and
heaven
will
resume
his
soul
at
the
appointed
timethat
is
to
say
soon
at
this
point
in
aramiss
gloomy
analysis
a
bird
of
night
uttered
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
that
prolonged
and
plaintive
cry
which
makes
every
creature
tremble
i
will
exile
the
deposed
king
said
philippe
shuddering
twill
be
more
human
the
kings
good
pleasure
will
decide
the
point
said
aramis
but
has
the
problem
been
well
put
have
i
brought
out
of
the
solution
according
to
the
wishes
or
the
foresight
of
your
royal
highness
yes
monsieur
yes
you
have
forgotten
nothingexcept
indeed
two
things
the
first
let
us
speak
of
it
at
once
with
the
same
frankness
we
have
already
conversed
in
let
us
speak
of
the
causes
which
may
bring
about
the
ruin
of
all
the
hopes
we
have
conceived
let
us
speak
of
the
risks
we
are
running
they
would
be
immense
infinite
terrific
insurmountable
if
as
i
have
said
all
things
did
not
concur
to
render
them
of
absolutely
no
account
there
is
no
danger
either
for
you
or
for
me
if
the
constancy
and
intrepidity
of
your
royal
highness
are
equal
to
that
perfection
of
resemblance
to
your
brother
which
nature
has
bestowed
upon
you
i
repeat
it
there
are
no
dangers
only
obstacles
a
word
indeed
which
i
find
in
all
languages
but
have
always
illunderstood
and
were
i
king
would
have
obliterated
as
useless
and
absurd
yes
indeed
monsieur
there
is
a
very
serious
obstacle
an
insurmountable
danger
which
you
are
forgetting
ah
said
aramis
there
is
conscience
which
cries
aloud
remorse
that
never
dies
true
true
said
the
bishop
there
is
a
weakness
of
heart
of
which
you
remind
me
you
are
right
too
for
that
indeed
is
an
immense
obstacle
the
horse
afraid
of
the
ditch
leaps
into
the
middle
of
it
and
is
killed
the
man
who
trembling
crosses
his
sword
with
that
of
another
leaves
loopholes
whereby
his
enemy
has
him
in
his
power
have
you
a
brother
said
the
young
man
to
aramis
i
am
alone
in
the
world
said
the
latter
with
a
hard
dry
voice
but
surely
there
is
some
one
in
the
world
whom
you
love
added
philippe
no
oneyes
i
love
you
the
young
man
sank
into
so
profound
a
silence
that
the
mere
sound
of
his
respiration
seemed
like
a
roaring
tumult
for
aramis
monseigneur
he
resumed
i
have
not
said
all
i
had
to
say
to
your
royal
highness
i
have
not
offered
you
all
the
salutary
counsels
and
useful
resources
which
i
have
at
my
disposal
it
is
useless
to
flash
bright
visions
before
the
eyes
of
one
who
seeks
and
loves
darkness
useless
too
is
it
to
let
the
magnificence
of
the
cannons
roar
make
itself
heard
in
the
ears
of
one
who
loves
repose
and
the
quiet
of
the
country
monseigneur
i
have
your
happiness
spread
out
before
me
in
my
thoughts
listen
to
my
words
precious
they
indeed
are
in
their
import
and
their
sense
for
you
who
look
with
such
tender
regard
upon
the
bright
heavens
the
verdant
meadows
the
pure
air
i
know
a
country
instinct
with
delights
of
every
kind
an
unknown
paradise
a
secluded
corner
of
the
worldwhere
alone
unfettered
and
unknown
in
the
thick
covert
of
the
woods
amidst
flowers
and
streams
of
rippling
water
you
will
forget
all
the
misery
that
human
folly
has
so
recently
allotted

oh
listen

me
my

do
not

your
ownaye
even
to
its
depths
i
will
not
take
you
unready
for
your
task
in

to
cast
you
into
the
crucible
of
my

desires

my
caprice

my
ambition
let
it
be

nothing
you
are
chilled

sick
at
heart
overcome
by
excess
of
the
emotions
which
but
one
hours
liberty
has
produced
in
you
for
me
that
is
a
certain
and
unmistakable
sign
that
you
do
not

you

a
more
humble
life
a
life
more
suited

your
strength
heaven

my
witness
that
i

which

i
shall
at

have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
have

to
my

the

service
he

made

human

the
former
task

more
difficult
and
now
monseigneur
your
answer
to
this
proposition
here
is
the
money
nay
do
not
hesitate
at
poitou
you
can
risk
nothing
except
the
chance
of
catching
the
fevers
prevalent
there
and
even
of
them
the
socalled
wizards
of
the
country
will
cure
you
for
the
sake
of
your
pistoles
if
you
play
the
other
game
you
run
the
chance
of
being
assassinated
on
a
throne
strangled
in
a
prisoncell
upon
my
soul
i
assure
you
now
i
begin
to
compare
them
together
i
myself
should
hesitate
which
lot
i
should
accept
monsieur
replied
the
young
prince
before
i
determine
let
me
alight
from
this
carriage
walk
on
the
ground
and
consult
that
still
voice
within
me
which
heaven
bids
us
all
to
hearken
to
ten
minutes
is
all
i
ask
and
then
you
shall
have
your
answer
as
you
please

aramis
bending
before

respect
so
solemn

sounded
these
strange
words

the
first
to
descend
from
the

he
held
the
door
open
for
the
young
man
he
saw
him
place
his
foot
on
the
mossy
ground
with
a
trembling
of
the
whole
body
and
walk
round
the
carriage
with
an
unsteady
and
almost
tottering
step
it
seemed
as
if
the
poor
prisoner
was
unaccustomed
to
walk
on

it
was
the
15th
of
august
about
eleven
oclock
at
night
thick
clouds
portending
a
tempest
overspread
the
heavens
and
shrouded
every
light
and
prospect
underneath
their
heavy
folds
the
extremities
of
the
avenues
were
imperceptibly
detached
from
the
copse
by
a
lighter
shadow
of
opaque
gray
which
upon
closer
examination
became
visible
in
the
midst
of
the
obscurity
but
the
fragrance
which
ascended
from
the
grass
fresher
and
more
penetrating
than
that
which
exhaled
from
the
trees
around
him
the
warm
and
balmy
air
which
enveloped
him
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
past
the
ineffable
enjoyment
of
liberty
in
an
open
country
spoke
to
the
prince
in
so
seductive
a
language
that
notwithstanding
the
preternatural
caution
we
would
almost
say
dissimulation
of
his
character
of
which
we
have
tried
to
give
an
idea
he
could
not
restrain
his
emotion
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
ecstasy
then
by
degrees
he
raised
his
aching
head
and
inhaled
the
softly
scented
air
as
it
was
wafted
in
gentle
gusts
to
his
uplifted
face
crossing
his
arms
on
his
chest
as
if
to
control
this
new
sensation
of
delight
he
drank
in
delicious
draughts
of
that
mysterious
air
which
interpenetrates
at
night
the
loftiest
forests
the
sky
he
was
contemplating
the
murmuring
waters
the
universal
freshnesswas
not
all
this
reality
was
not
aramis
a
madman
to
suppose
that
he
had
aught
else
to
dream
of
in
this
world
those
exciting
pictures
of
country
life
so
free
from
fears
and
troubles
the
ocean
of
happy
days
that
glitters
incessantly
before
all
young
imaginations
are
real
allurements
wherewith
to
fascinate
a
poor
unhappy
prisoner
worn
out
by
prison
cares
emaciated
by
the
stifling
air
of
the
bastile
it
was
the
picture
it
will
be
remembered
drawn
by
aramis
when
he
offered
the
thousand
pistoles
he
had
with
him
in
the
carriage
to
the
prince
and
the
enchanted
eden
which
the
deserts
of
baspoitou
hid
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
such
were
the
reflections
of
aramis
as
he
watched
with
an
anxiety
impossible
to
describe
the
silent
progress
of
the
emotions
of
philippe
whom
he
perceived
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
absorbed
in
his
meditations
the
young
prince
was
offering
up
an
inward
prayer
to
heaven
to
be
divinely
guided
in
this
trying
moment
upon
which
his
life
or
death
depended
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
the
bishop
of
vannes
who
had
never
before
been
so
perplexed
his
iron
will
accustomed
to
overcome
all
obstacles
never
finding
itself
inferior
or
vanquished
on
any
occasion
to
be
foiled
in
so
vast
a
project
from
not
having
foreseen
the
influence
which
a
view
of
nature
in
all
its
luxuriance
would
have
on
the
human
mind
aramis
overwhelmed
by
anxiety
contemplated
with
emotion
the
painful
struggle
that
was
taking
place
in
philippes
mind
this
suspense
lasted
the
whole
ten
minutes
which
the
young
man
had
requested
during
this
space
of
time
which
appeared
an
eternity
philippe
continued
gazing
with
an
imploring
and
sorrowful
look
towards
the
heavens
aramis
did
not
remove
the
piercing
glance
he
had
fixed
on
philippe
suddenly
the
young
man
bowed
his
head
his
thought
returned
to
the
earth
his
looks
perceptibly
hardened
his
brow
contracted
his
mouth
assuming
an
expression
of
undaunted
courage
again
his
looks
became
fixed
but
this
time
they
wore
a
worldly
expression
hardened
by
covetousness
pride
and
strong
desire
aramiss
look
immediately
became
as
soft
as
it
had
before
been
gloomy
philippe
seizing
his
hand
in
a
quick
agitated
manner
exclaimed
lead
me
to
where
the
crown
of
france
is
to
be
found
is
this
your
decision
monseigneur
asked
aramis
it
is
irrevocably
so
philippe
did
not
even
deign
to
reply
he
gazed
earnestly
at
the
bishop
as
if
to
ask
him
if
it
were
possible
for
a
man
to
waver
after
having
once
made
up
his
mind
such
looks
are
flashes
of
the
hidden
fire
that
betrays
mens
character
said
aramis
bowing
over
philippes
hand
you
will
be
great
monseigneur
i
will
answer
for
that
let
us
resume
our
conversation
i
wished
to
discuss
two
points
with
you
in
the
first
place
the
dangers
or
the
obstacles
we
may
meet
with
that
point
is
decided
the
other
is
the
conditions
you
intend
imposing
on
me
it
is
your
turn
to
speak
m
dherblay
the
conditions
monseigneur
doubtless
you
will
not
allow
so
mere
a
trifle
to
stop
me
and
you
will
not
do
me
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
i
think
you
have
no
interest
in
this
affair
therefore
without
subterfuge
or
hesitation
tell
me
the
truth
i
will
do
so
monseigneur
once
a
king
when
will
that
be
tomorrow
eveningi
mean
in
the
night
explain
yourself
when
i
shall
have
asked
your
highness
a
question
do
so
i
sent
to
your
highness
a
man
in
my
confidence
with
instructions
to
deliver
some
closely
written
notes
carefully
drawn
up
which
will
thoroughly
acquaint
your
highness
with
the
different
persons
who
compose
and
will
compose
your
court
i
perused
those
notes
attentively
i
know
them
by
heart
and
understand
them
pardon
me
but
i
may
venture
to
ask
that
question
of
a
poor
abandoned
captive
of
the
bastile
in
a
weeks
time
it
will
not
be
requisite
to
further
question
a
mind
like
yours
you
will
then
be
in
full
possession
of
liberty
and
power
interrogate
me
then
and
i
will
be
a
scholar
representing
his
lesson
to
his
master
we
will
begin
with
your
family
monseigneur
my
mother
anne
of
austria
all
her
sorrows
her
painful
malady
oh
i
know
heri
know
her
your
second
brother
asked
aramis
bowing
to
these
notes
replied
the
prince
you
have
added
portraits
so
faithfully
painted
that
i
am
able
to
recognize
the
persons
whose
characters
manners
and
history
you
have
so
carefully
portrayed
monsieur
my
brother
is
a
fine
dark
young
man
with
a
pale
face
he
does
not
love
his
wife
henrietta
whom
i
louis
xiv
loved
a
little
and
still
flirt
with
even
although
she
made
me
weep
on
the
day
she
wished
to
dismiss
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
from
her
service
in
disgrace
you
will
have
to
be
careful
with
regard
to
the
watchfulness
of
the
latter
said
aramis
she
is
sincerely
attached
to
the
actual
king
the
eyes
of
a
woman
who
loves
are
not
easily
deceived
she
is
fair
has
blue
eyes
whose
affectionate
gaze
reveals
her
identity
she
halts
slightly
in
her
gait
she
writes
a
letter
every
day
to
which
i
have
to
send
an
answer
by
m
de
saintaignan
do
you
know
the
latter
as
if
i
saw
him
and
i
know
the
last
verses
he
composed
for
me
as
well
as
those
i
composed
in
answer
to
his
very
good
do
you
know
your
ministers
colbert
an
ugly
darkbrowed
man
but
intelligent
enough
his
hair
covering
his
forehead
a
large
heavy
full
head
the
mortal
enemy
of
m
fouquet
as
for
the
latter
we
need
not
disturb
ourselves
about
him
no
because
necessarily
you
will
not
require
me
to
exile
him
i
suppose
aramis
struck
with
admiration
at
the
remark
said
you
will
become
very
great
monseigneur
you
see
added
the
prince
that
i
know
my
lesson
by
heart
and
with
heavens
assistance
and
yours
afterwards
i
shall
seldom
go
wrong
you
have
still
an
awkward
pair
of
eyes
to
deal
with
monseigneur
yes
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
m
dartagnan
your
friend
yes
i
can
well
say
my
friend
he
who
escorted
la
valliere
to
le
chaillot
he
who
delivered
up
monk
cooped
in
an
iron
box
to
charles
ii
he
who
so
faithfully
served
my
mother
he
to
whom
the
crown
of
france
owes
so
much
that
it
owes
everything
do
you
intend
to
ask
me
to
exile
him
also
never
sire
dartagnan
is
a
man
to
whom
at
a
certain
given
time
i
will
undertake
to
reveal
everything
but
be
on
your
guard
with
him
for
if
he
discovers
our
plot
before
it
is
revealed
to
him
you
or
i
will
certainly
be
killed
or
taken
he
is
a
bold
and
enterprising
man
i
will
think
it
over
now
tell
me
about
m
fouquet
what
do
you
wish
to
be
done
with
regard
to
him
one
moment
more
i
entreat
you
monseigneur
and
forgive
me
if
i
seem
to
fail
in
respect
to
questioning
you
further
it
is
your
duty
to
do
so
nay
more
than
that
your
right
before
we
pass
to
m
fouquet
i
should
very
much
regret
forgetting
another
friend
of
mine
m
du
vallon
the
hercules
of
france
you
mean
oh
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
his
interests
are
more
than
safe
no
it
is
not
he
whom
i
intended
to
refer
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
then
and
his
son
the
son
of
all
four
of
us
that
poor
boy
who
is
dying
of
love
for
la
valliere
whom
my
brother
so
disloyally
bereft
him
of
be
easy
on
that
score
i
shall
know
how
to
rehabilitate
his
happiness
tell
me
only
one
thing
monsieur
dherblay
do
men
when
they
love
forget
the
treachery
that
has
been
shown
them
can
a
man
ever
forgive
the
woman
who
has
betrayed
him
is
that
a
french
custom
or
is
it
one
of
the
laws
of
the
human
heart
a
man
who
loves
deeply
as
deeply
as
raoul
loves
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
finishes
by
forgetting
the
fault
or
crime
of
the
woman
he
loves
but
i
do
not
yet
know
whether
raoul
will
be
able
to
forget
i
will
see
after
that
have
you
anything
further
to
say
about
your
friend
no
that
is
all
well
then
now
for
m
fouquet
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
for
him
to
keep
him
on
as
surintendant
in
the
capacity
in
which
he
has
hitherto
acted
i
entreat
you
be
it
so
but
he
is
the
first
minister
at
present
not
quite
so
a
king
ignorant
and
embarrassed
as
i
shall
be
will
as
a
matter
of
course
require
a
first
minister
of
state
your
majesty
will
require
a
friend
i
have
only
one
and
that
is
yourself
you
will
have
many
others
by
and
by
but
none
so
devoted
none
so
zealous
for
your
glory
you
shall
be
my
first
minister
of
state
not
immediately
monseigneur
for
that
would
give
rise
to
too
much
suspicion
and
astonishment
m
de
richelieu
the
first
minister
of
my
grandmother
marie
de
medici
was
simply
bishop
of
lucon
as
you
are
bishop
of
vannes
i
perceive
that
your
royal
highness
has
studied
my
notes
to
great
advantage
your
amazing
perspicacity
overpowers
me
with
delight
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
m
de
richelieu
by
means
of
the
queens
protection
soon
became
cardinal
it
would
be
better
said
aramis
bowing
that
i
should
not
be
appointed
first
minister
until
your
royal
highness
has
procured
my
nomination
as
cardinal
you
shall
be
nominated
before
two
months
are
past
monsieur
dherblay
but
that
is
a
matter
of
very
trifling
moment
you
would
not
offend
me
if
you
were
to
ask
more
than
that
and
you
would
cause
me
serious
regret
if
you
were
to
limit
yourself
to
that
in
that
case
i
have
something
still
further
to
hope
for
monseigneur
speak
speak
m
fouquet
will
not
keep
long
at
the
head
of
affairs
he
will
soon
get
old
he
is
fond
of
pleasure
consistently
i
mean
with
all
his
labors
thanks
to
the
youthfulness
he
still
retains
but
this
protracted
youth
will
disappear
at
the
approach
of
the
first
serious
annoyance
or
at
the
first
illness
he
may
experience
we
will
spare
him
the
annoyance
because
he
is
an
agreeable
and
noblehearted
man
but
we
cannot
save
him
from
illhealth
so
it
is
determined
when
you
shall
have
paid
all
m
fouquets
debts
and
restored
the
finances
to
a
sound
condition
m
fouquet
will
be
able
to
remain
the
sovereign
ruler
in
his
little
court
of
poets
and
painterswe
shall
have
made
him
rich
when
that
has
been
done
and
i
have
become
your
royal
highnesss
prime
minister
i
shall
be
able
to
think
of
my
own
interests
and
yours
the
young
man
looked
at
his
interrogator
m
de
richelieu
of
whom
we
were
speaking
just
now
was
very
much
to
blame
in
the
fixed
idea
he
had
of
governing
france
alone
unaided
he
allowed
two
kings
king
louis
xiii
and
himself
to

you

it

never

i
shall
always

sufficiently
aloof

all

the
chateau
of
vauxlevicomte
situated
about
a
league
from
melun
had
been
built
by
fouquet
in
1655
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
scarcity
of
money
in
france
mazarin
had
taken
all
that
there
was
and
fouquet
expended
the
remainder
however
as
certain
men
have
fertile
false
and
useful
vices
fouquet
in
scattering
broadcast
millions
of
money
in
the
construction
of
this
palace
had
found
a
means
of
gathering
as
the

of
his
generous
profusion
three
illustrious

the

de

possessed
a
single
fault
with
which
it
could
be
reproached
it
was
its
grand
pretentious
character
it
is
even
at
the
present
day
proverbial
to
calculate
the
number
of
acres
of
roofing
the
restoration
of
which
would
in
our
age
be
the
ruin

around

four

rose
majestically
to
the
whole
height

the
building
the
friezes
ornamented
with
arabesques

the
pediments
which
crowned
the

conferred
richness
and
grace
on
every
part

the
domes
which

the
whole
added
proportion

majesty
this
mansion
built
by
a
subject
bore
a
far
greater
resemblance

those
royal

fancied
he
was
called
upon
to
construct
in
order
to
present
them
to
his
master
from
the
fear

rendering
him
jealous

one
particular

the
mournful
shade
of
the

surintendant

to
his
work
the

covered
with

stained
with

pale
from

inspiration
of

was
putting
the
last
finishing

his
rapid
brush

was
the
portrait
of
the
king

were
expecting

in

placed
himself
before
this
portrait
which
seemed
to
live
as
one
might
say
in
the
cool
freshness
of
its
flesh
and
in
its
warmth
of
color
he
gazed
upon
it
long
and
fixedly
estimated
the
prodigious
labor
that

been
bestowed
upon
it
and
not
being
able
to
find
any
recompense
sufficiently
great
for
this
herculean
effort
he
passed
his
arm
round
the
painters
neck
and
embraced
him
the
surintendant
by
this
action
had
utterly
ruined
a
suit
of
clothes
worth
a
thousand
pistoles
but
he
had
satisfied
more
than
satisfied
lebrun
it
was
a
happy
moment
for
the
artist
it
was
an
unhappy
moment
for
m
percerin
who
was
walking
behind
fouquet
and
was
engaged
in
admiring
in
lebruns
painting
the
suit
that
he
had
made
for
his
majesty
a
perfect
objet
dart
as
he
called
it
which
was
not
to
be
matched
except
in
the
wardrobe
of
the
surintendant
his
distress
and
his
exclamations
were
interrupted
by
a
signal
which
had
been
given
from
the
summit
of
the
mansion
in
the
direction
of
melun
in
the
still
empty
open
plain
the
sentinels
of
vaux
had
just
perceived
the
advancing
procession
of
the
king
and
the
queens
his
majesty
was
entering
melun
with
his
long
train
of
carriages
and
cavaliers
in
an
hour
said
aramis
to
fouquet
in
an
hour
replied
the
latter
sighing
and
the
people
who
ask
one
another
what
is
the
good
of
these
royal
fetes
continued
the
bishop
of
vannes
laughing
with
his
false
smile
alas
i
too
who
am
not
the
people
ask
myself
the
same
thing
i
will
answer
you
in
four
and
twenty
hours
monseigneur
assume
a
cheerful
countenance
for
it
should
be
a
day
of
true
rejoicing
well
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
dherblay
said
the
surintendant
with
a
swelling
heart
pointing
at
the
cortege
of
louis
visible
in
the
horizon
he
certainly
loves
me
but
very
little
and
i
do
not
care
much
more
for
him
but
i
cannot
tell
you
how
it
is
that
since
he
is
approaching
my
house
well
what
well
since
i
know
he
is
on
his
way
here
as
my
guest
he
is
more
sacred
than
ever
for
me
he
is
my
acknowledged
sovereign
and
as
such
is
very
dear
to
me
dear
yes
said
aramis
playing
upon
the
word
as
the
abbe
terray
did
at
a
later
period
with
louis
xv
do
not
laugh
dherblay
i
feel
that
if
he
really
seemed
to
wish
it
i
could
love
that
young
man
you
should
not
say
that
to
me
returned
aramis
but
rather
to
m
colbert
to
m
colbert
exclaimed
fouquet
why
so
because
he
would
allow
you
a
pension
out
of
the
kings
privy
purse
as
soon
as
he
becomes
surintendant
said
aramis
preparing
to
leave
as
soon
as
he
had
dealt
this
last
blow
where
are
you
going
returned
fouquet
with
a
gloomy
look
to
my
own
apartment
in
order
to
change
my
costume
monseigneur
whereabouts
are
you
lodging
dherblay
in
the
blue
room
on
the
second
story
the
room
immediately
over
the
kings
room
precisely
you
will
be
subject
to
very
great
restraint
there
what
an
idea
to
condemn
yourself
to
a
room
where
you
cannot
stir
or
move
about
during
the
night
monseigneur
i
sleep
or
read
in
my
bed
and
your
servants
i
have
but
one
attendant
with
me
i
find
my
reader
quite
sufficient
adieu
monseigneur
do
not
overfatigue
yourself
keep
yourself
fresh
for
the
arrival
of
the
king
we
shall
see
you
by
and
by
i
suppose
and
shall
see
your
friend
du
vallon
also
he
is
lodging
next
to
me
and
is
at
this
moment
dressing
and
fouquet
bowing
with
a
smile

on
like

chapter
xii
the
wine
of
melun
the
king
had
in
point
of
fact
entered
melun
with
the
intention
of
merely
passing
through
the
city
the
youthful
monarch
was
most
eagerly
anxious
for
amusements
only
twice
during
the
journey
had
he
been
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
la
valliere
and
suspecting
that
his
only
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
would
be
after
nightfall
in
the
gardens
and
after
the
ceremonial
of
reception
had
been
gone
through
he
had
been
very
desirous
to
arrive
at
vaux
as
early
as
possible
but
he
reckoned
without
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
and
without
m
colbert
like
calypso
who
could
not
be
consoled
at
the
departure
of
ulysses
our
gascon
could
not
console
himself
for
not
having
guessed
why
aramis
had
asked
percerin
to
show
him
the
kings
new
costumes
there
is
not
a
doubt
he
said
to
himself
that
my
friend
the
bishop
of
vannes
had
some
motive
in
that
and
then
he
began
to
rack
his
brains
most
uselessly
dartagnan
so
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
court
intrigues
who
knew
the
position
of
fouquet
better
than
even
fouquet
himself
did
had
conceived
the
strangest
fancies
and
suspicions
at
the
announcement
of
the
fete
which
would
have
ruined
a
wealthy
man
and
which
became
impossible
utter
madness
even
for
a
man
so
poor
as
he
was
and
then
the
presence
of
aramis
who
had
returned
from
belleisle
and
been
nominated
by
monsieur
fouquet
inspectorgeneral
of
all
the
arrangements
his
perseverance
in
mixing
himself
up
with
all
the
surintendants
affairs
his
visits
to
baisemeaux
all
this
suspicious
singularity
of
conduct
had
excessively
troubled
and
tormented
dartagnan
during
the
last
two
weeks
with
men
of
aramiss
stamp
he
said
one
is
never
the
stronger
except
sword
in
hand
so
long
as
aramis
continued
a
soldier
there
was
hope
of
getting
the
better
of
him
but
since
he
has
covered
his
cuirass
with
a
stole
we
are
lost
but
what
can
aramiss
object
possibly
be
and
dartagnan
plunged
again
into
deep
thought
what
does
it
matter
to
me
after
all
he
continued
if
his
only
object
is
to
overthrow
m
colbert
and
what
else
can
he
be
after
and
dartagnan
rubbed
his
foreheadthat
fertile
land
whence
the
plowshare
of
his
nails
had
turned
up
so
many
and
such
admirable
ideas
in
his
time
he
at
first
thought
of
talking
the
matter
over
with
colbert
but
his
friendship
for
aramis
the
oath
of
earlier
days
bound
him
too
strictly
he
revolted
at
the
bare
idea
of
such
a
thing
and
besides
he
hated
the
financier
too
cordially
then
again
he
wished
to
unburden
his
mind
to
the
king
but
yet
the
king
would
not
be
able
to
understand
the
suspicions
which
had
not
even
a
shadow
of
reality
at
their
base
he
resolved
to
address
himself
to
aramis
direct
the
first
time
he
met
him
i
will
get
him
said
the
musketeer
between
a
couple
of
candles
suddenly
and
when
he
least
expects
it
i
will
place
my
hand
upon
his
heart
and
he
will
tell
mewhat
will
he
tell
me
yes
he
will
tell
me
something
for
mordioux
there
is
something
in
it
i
know
somewhat
calmer
dartagnan
made
every
preparation
for
the
journey
and
took
the
greatest
care
that
the
military
household
of
the
king
as
yet
very
inconsiderable
in
numbers
should
be
well
officered
and
well
disciplined
in
its
meager
and
limited
proportions
the
result
was
that
through
the
captains
arrangements
the
king
on
arriving
at
melun
saw
himself
at
the
head
of
both
the
musketeers
and
swiss
guards
as
well
as
a
picket
of
the
french
guards
it
might
almost
have
been
called
a
small
army
m
colbert
looked
at
the
troops
with
great
delight
he
even
wished
they
had
been
a
third
more
in
number
but
why
said
the
king
in
order
to
show
greater
honor
to
m
fouquet
replied
colbert
in
order
to
ruin
him
the
sooner
thought
dartagnan
when
this
little
army
appeared
before
melun
the
chief
magistrates
came
out
to
meet
the
king
and
to
present
him
with
the
keys
of
the
city
and
invited
him
to
enter
the
hotel
de
ville
in
order
to
partake
of
the
wine
of
honor
the
king
who
expected
to
pass
through
the
city
and
to
proceed
to
vaux
without
delay
became
quite
red
in
the
face
from
vexation
who
was
fool
enough
to
occasion
this
delay
muttered
the
king
between
his
teeth
as
the
chief
magistrate
was
in
the
middle
of
a
long
address
not
i
certainly
replied
dartagnan
but
i
believe
it
was
m
colbert
colbert
having
heard
his
name
pronounced
said
what
was
m
dartagnan
good
enough
to
say
i
was
good
enough
to
remark
that
it
was
you
who
stopped
the
kings
progress
so
that
he
might
taste
the
vin
de
brie
was
i
right
quite
so
monsieur
in
that
case
then
it
was
you
whom
the
king
called
some
name
or
other
what
name
i
hardly
know
but
wait
a
momentidiot
i
think
it
wasno
no
it
was
fool
or
dolt
yes
his
majesty
said
that
the
man
who
had
thought
of
the
vin
de
melun
was
something
of
the
sort
dartagnan
after
this
broadside
quietly
caressed
his
mustache
m
colberts
large
head
seemed
to
become
larger
and
larger
than
ever
dartagnan
seeing
how
ugly
anger
made
him
did
not
stop
halfway
the
orator
still
went
on
with
his
speech
while
the
kings
color
was
visibly
increasing
mordioux
said
the
musketeer
coolly
the
king
is
going
to
have
an
attack
of
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
where
the
deuce
did
you
get
hold
of
that
idea
monsieur
colbert
you
have
no
luck
monsieur
said
the
financier
drawing
himself
up
my
zeal
for
the
kings
service
inspired
me
with
the
idea
bah
monsieur
melun
is
a
city
an
excellent
city
which
pays
well
and
which
it
would
be
imprudent
to
displease
there
now
i
who
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
financier
saw
only
one
idea
in
your
idea
what
was
that
monsieur
that
of
causing
a
little
annoyance
to
m
fouquet
who
is
making
himself
quite
giddy
on
his
donjons
yonder
in
waiting
for
us
this
was
a
homestroke
hard
enough
in
all
conscience
colbert
was
completely
thrown
out
of
the
saddle
by
it
and
retired
thoroughly
discomfited
fortunately
the
speech
was
now
at
an
end
the
king
drank
the
wine
which
was
presented
to
him
and
then
every
one
resumed
the
progress
through
the
city
the
king
bit
his
lips
in
anger
for
the
evening
was
closing
in
and
all
hope
of
a
walk
with
la
valliere
was
at
an
end
in
order
that
the
whole
of
the
kings
household
should
enter
vaux
four
hours
at
least
were
necessary
owing
to
the
different
arrangements
the
king
therefore
who
was
boiling
with
impatience
hurried
forward
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
reach
it
before
nightfall
but
at
the
moment
he
was
setting
off
again
other
and
fresh
difficulties
arose
is
not
the
king
going
to
sleep
at
melun
said
colbert
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
to
dartagnan
m
colbert
must
have
been
badly
inspired
that
day
to
address
himself
in
that
manner
to
the
chief
of
the
musketeers
for
the
latter
guessed
that
the
kings
intention
was
very
far
from
that
of
remaining
where
he
was
dartagnan
would
not
allow
him
to
enter
vaux
except
he
were
well
and
strongly
accompanied
and
desired
that
his
majesty
would
not
enter
except
with
all
the
escort
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
that
these
delays
would
irritate
that
impatient
monarch
beyond
measure
in
what
way
could
he
possibly
reconcile
these
difficulties
dartagnan
took
up
colberts
remark
and
determined
to
repeated
it
to
the
king
sire
he
said
m
colbert
has
been
asking
me
if
your
majesty
does
not
intend
to
sleep
at
melun
sleep
at
melun
what
for
exclaimed
louis
xiv
sleep
at
melun
who
in
heavens
name
can
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
when
m
fouquet
is
expecting
us
this
evening
it
was
simply
replied
colbert
quickly
the
fear
of
causing
your
majesty
the
least
delay
for
according
to
established
etiquette
you
cannot
enter
any
place
with
the
exception
of
your
own
royal
residences
until
the
soldiers
quarters
have
been
marked
out
by
the
quartermaster
and
the
garrison
properly
distributed
dartagnan
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
biting
his
mustache
to
conceal
his
vexation
and
the
queens
were
not
less
interested
they
were
fatigued
and
would
have
preferred
to
go
to
rest
without
proceeding
any
farther
more
especially
in
order
to
prevent
the
king
walking
about
in
the
evening
with
m
de
saintaignan
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
for
if
etiquette
required
the
princesses
to
remain
within
their
own
rooms
the
ladies
of
honor
as
soon
as
they
had
performed
the
services
required
of
them
had
no
restrictions
placed
upon
them
but
were
at
liberty
to
walk
about
as
they
pleased
it
will
easily
be
conjectured
that
all
these
rival
interests
gathering
together
in
vapors
necessarily
produced
clouds
and
that
the
clouds
were
likely
to
be
followed
by
a
tempest
the
king
had
no
mustache
to
gnaw
and
therefore
kept
biting
the
handle
of
his
whip
instead
with
illconcealed
impatience
how
could
he
get
out
of
it

looked
as
agreeable
as
possible
and

as
sulky
as

who

there
he
could
get
in
a
passion
with

will
consult
the
queen
said
louis
xiv
bowing
to
the
royal
ladies
and
this
kindness
of
consideration
softened
maria

heart
who
being
of
a
kind
and
generous
disposition
when
left
to
her
own
freewill
replied
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
whatever
your
majesty
wishes
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
get
to

inquired
anne
of
austria
in
slow
and
measured
accents
placing
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
where
the
seat
of
her
pain
lay
an
hour
for
your
majestys
carriages
said
dartagnan
the
roads
are
tolerably
good
the
king
looked
at
him
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
the
king
he
hastened
to
add
we
should
arrive
by
daylight
said
louis
xiv
but
the
billeting
of
the
kings
military
escort
objected
colbert
softly
will
make
his
majesty
lose
all
the
advantage
of
his
speed
however
quick
he
may
be
double
ass
that
you
are
thought
dartagnan
if
i
had
any
interest
or
motive
in
demolishing
your
credit
with
the
king
i
could
do
it
in
ten
minutes
if
i
were
in
the
kings
place
he
added
aloud
i
should
in
going
to
m
fouquet
leave
my
escort
behind
me
i
should
go
to
him
as
a
friend
i
should
enter
accompanied
only
by
my
captain
of
the
guards
i
should
consider
that
i
was
acting
more
nobly
and
should
be
invested
with
a
still
more
sacred
character
by
doing
so
delight
sparkled
in
the
kings
eyes
that
is
indeed
a
very
sensible
suggestion
we
will
go
to
see
a
friend
as
friends
the
gentlemen
who
are
with
the
carriages
can
go
slowly
but
we
who
are
mounted
will
ride
on
and
he
rode
off
accompanied
by
all
those
who
were
mounted
colbert
hid
his
ugly
head
behind
his
horses
neck
i
shall
be
quits
said
dartagnan
as
he
galloped
along
by
getting
a
little
talk
with
aramis
this
evening
and
then
m
fouquet
is
a
man
of
honor
mordioux
i
have
said
so
and
it
must
be
so
and
this
was
the
way
how
towards
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
without
announcing
his
arrival
by
the
din
of
trumpets
and
without
even
his
advanced
guard
without
outriders
or
musketeers
the
king
presented
himself
before
the
gate
of
vaux
where
fouquet
who
had
been
informed
of
his
royal
guests
approach
had
been
waiting
for
the
last
halfhour
with
his
head
uncovered
surrounded
by
his
household
and
his
friends

m
fouquet
held
the
stirrup
of
the
king
who
having
dismounted
bowed
most
graciously
and
more
graciously
still
held
out
his
hand
to
him
which
fouquet
in
spite
of
a
slight
resistance
on
the
kings
part
carried
respectfully
to
his
lips
the
king
wished
to
wait
in
the
first
courtyard
for
the
arrival
of
the
carriages
nor
had
he
long
to
wait
for
the
roads
had
been
put
into
excellent
order
by
the
superintendent
and
a
stone
would
hardly
have
been
found
of
the
size
of
an
egg
the
whole
way
from
melun
to
vaux
so
that
the
carriages
rolling
along
as
though
on
a
carpet
brought
the
ladies
to
vaux
without
jolting
or
fatigue
by
eight
oclock
they
were
received
by
madame
fouquet
and
at
the
moment
they
made
their
appearance
a
light
as
bright
as
day
burst
forth
from
every
quarter
trees
vases
and
marble
statues
this
species
of
enchantment
lasted
until
their
majesties
had
retired
into
the
palace
all
these
wonders
and
magical
effects
which
the
chronicler
has
heaped
up
or
rather
embalmed
in
his
recital
at
the
risk
of
rivaling
the
brainborn
scenes
of
romancers
these
splendors
whereby
night
seemed
vanquished
and
nature
corrected
together
with
every
delight
and
luxury
combined
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
the
senses
as
well
as
the
imagination
fouquet
did
in
real
truth
offer
to
his
sovereign
in
that
enchanting
retreat
of
which
no
monarch
could
at
that
time
boast
of
possessing
an
equal
we
do
not
intend
to
describe
the
grand
banquet
at
which
the
royal
guests
were
present
nor
the
concerts
nor
the
fairylike
and
more
than
magic
transformations
and
metamorphoses
it
will
be
enough
for
our
purpose
to
depict
the
countenance
the
king
assumed
which
from
being
gay
soon
wore
a
very
gloomy
constrained
and
irritated
expression
he
remembered
his
own
residence
royal
though
it
was
and
the
mean
and
indifferent
style
of
luxury
that
prevailed
there
which
comprised
but
little
more
than
what
was
merely
useful
for
the
royal
wants
without
being
his
own
personal
property
the
large
vases
of
the
louvre
the
older
furniture
and
plate
of
henry
ii
of
francis
i
and
of
louis
xi
were
but
historic
monuments
of
earlier
days
nothing
but
specimens
of
art
the
relics
of
his
predecessors
while
with
fouquet
the
value
of
the
article
was
as
much
in
the
workmanship
as
in
the
article
itself
fouquet
ate
from
a
gold
service
which
artists
in
his
own
employ
had
modeled
and
cast
for
him
alone
fouquet
drank
wines
of
which
the
king
of
france
did
not
even
know
the
name
and
drank
them
out
of
goblets
each
more
valuable
than
the
entire
royal
cellar
what
too
was
to
be
said
of
the
apartments
the
hangings
the
pictures
the
servants
and
officers
of
every
description
of
his
household
what
of
the
mode
of
service
in
which
etiquette
was
replaced
by
order
stiff
formality
by
personal
unrestrained
comfort
the
happiness
and
contentment
of
the
guest
became
the
supreme
law
of
all
who
obeyed
the
host
the
perfect
swarm
of
busily
engaged
persons
moving
about
noiselessly
the
multitude
of
guestswho
were
however
even
less
numerous
than
the
servants
who
waited
on
themthe
myriad
of
exquisitely
prepared
dishes
of
gold
and
silver
vases
the
floods
of
dazzling
light
the
masses
of
unknown
flowers
of
which
the
hothouses
had
been
despoiled
redundant
with
luxuriance
of
unequaled
scent
and
beauty
the
perfect
harmony
of
the
surroundings
which
indeed
was
no
more
than
the
prelude
of
the
promised
fete
charmed
all
who
were
there
and
they
testified
their
admiration
over
and
over
again
not
by
voice
or
gesture
but
by
deep
silence
and
rapt
attention
those
two
languages
of
the
courtier
which
acknowledge
the
hand
of
no
master
powerful
enough
to
restrain
them
as
for
the
king
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
dared
not
look
at
the
queen
anne
of
austria
whose
pride
was
superior
to
that
of
any
creature
breathing
overwhelmed
her
host
by
the
contempt
with
which
she
treated
everything
handed
to
her
the
young
queen
kindhearted
by
nature
and
curious
by
disposition
praised
fouquet
ate
with
an
exceedingly
good
appetite
and
asked
the
names
of
the
strange
fruits
as
they
were
placed
upon
the
table
fouquet
replied
that
he
was
not
aware
of
their
names
the
fruits
came
from
his
own
stores
he
had
often
cultivated
them
himself
having
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
cultivation
of
exotic
fruits
and
plants
the
king
felt
and
appreciated
the
delicacy
of
the
replies
but
was
only
the
more
humiliated
he
thought
the
queen
a
little
too
familiar
in
her
manners
and
that
anne
of
austria
resembled
juno
a
little
too
much
in
being
too
proud
and
haughty
his
chief
anxiety
however
was
himself
that
he
might
remain
cold
and
distant
in
his
behavior
bordering
lightly
the
limits
of
supreme
disdain
or
simple
admiration
but
fouquet
had
foreseen
all
this
he
was
in
fact
one
of
those
men
who
foresee
everything
the
king
had
expressly
declared
that
so
long
as
he
remained
under
fouquets
roof
he
did
not
wish
his
own
different
repasts
to
be
served
in
accordance
with
the
usual
etiquette
and
that
he
would
consequently
dine
with
the
rest
of
society
but
by
the
thoughtful
attention
of
the
surintendant
the
kings
dinner
was
served
up
separately
if
one
may
so
express
it
in
the
middle
of
the
general
table
the
dinner
wonderful
in
every
respect
from
the
dishes
of
which
was
composed
comprised
everything
the
king
liked
and
generally
preferred
to
anything
else
louis
had
no
excusehe
indeed
who
had
the
keenest
appetite
in
his
kingdomfor
saying
that
he
was
not
hungry
nay
m

did
even
better
still
he
certainly
in
obedience
to
the
kings
expressed
desire
seated
himself
at
the
table
but
as
soon
as
the
soups
were
served
he
arose
and
personally
waited
on
the
king
while
madame
fouquet
stood
behind
the
queenmothers
armchair
the
disdain
of
juno
and
the
sulky
fits
of
temper
of
jupiter
could
not
resist
this
excess
of
kindly
feeling
and
polite
attention
the
queen
ate
a
biscuit
dipped
in
a
glass
of
sanlucar
wine
and
the
king
ate
of
everything
saying
to
m
fouquet
it
is
impossible
monsieur
le
surintendant
to
dine
better
anywhere
whereupon
the
whole
court
began
on
all
sides
to
devour
the
dishes
spread
before
them
with
such
enthusiasm
that
it
looked
as
though
a
cloud
of
egyptian
locusts
was
settling
down
on
green
and
growing
crops
as
soon
however
as
his
hunger
was
appeased
the
king
became
morose
and
overgloomed
again
the
more
so
in
proportion
to
the
satisfaction
he
fancied
he
had
previously
manifested
and
particularly
on
account
of
the
deferential
manner
which
his
courtiers
had
shown
towards
fouquet
dartagnan
who
ate
a
good
deal
and
drank
but
little
without
allowing
it
to
be
noticed
did
not
lose
a
single
opportunity
but
made
a
great
number
of
observations
which
he
turned
to
good
profit
when
the
supper
was
finished
the
king
expressed
a
wish
not
to
lose
the
promenade
the
park
was
illuminated
the
moon
too
as
if
she
had
placed
herself
at
the
orders
of
the
lord
of

silvered
the
trees
and
lake
with
her
own
bright
and
quasiphosphorescent
light
the
air
was
strangely
soft
and
balmy
the
daintily
shellgravelled
walks
through
the
thickly
set
avenues
yielded
luxuriously
to
the
feet
the
fete
was
complete
in
every
respect
for
the
king
having
met
la
valliere
in
one
of
the
winding
paths
of
the
wood
was
able
to
press
her
hand
and
say
i
love
you
without
any
one
overhearing
him
except
m
dartagnan
who
followed
and
m
fouquet
who
preceded
him
the
dreamy
night
of
magical
enchantments
stole
smoothly
on
the
king
having
requested
to
be
shown
to
his
room
there
was
immediately
a
movement
in
every
direction
the
queens
passed
to
their
own
apartments
accompanied
by
them
music
of
theorbos
and
lutes
the
king
found
his
musketeers
awaiting
him
on
the
grand
flight
of
steps
for

had
brought
them
on
from
melun
and
had
invited

to
supper

suspicions
at
once
disappeared
he
was
weary
he
had
supped
well
and
wished
for
once
in
his
life
thoroughly
to
enjoy
a
fete
given
by
a
man
who
was
in
every
sense
of
the
word
a
king
m
fouquet
he
said
is
the
man
for
me
the
king
was
conducted
with
the
greatest
ceremony
to
the
chamber
of
morpheus
of
which
we
owe
some
cursory
description
to
our
readers
it
was
the
handsomest
and
largest
in
the
palace
lebrun
had
painted
on
the
vaulted
ceiling
the
happy
as
well
as
the
unhappy
dreams
which
morpheus
inflicts
on
kings
as
well
as
on
other
men
everything
that
sleep
gives
birth
to
that
is
lovely
its
fairy
scenes
its
flowers
and
nectar
the
wild
voluptuousness
or
profound
repose
of
the
senses
had
the
painter
elaborated
on
his
frescoes
it
was
a
composition
as
soft
and
pleasing
in
one
part
as
dark
and
gloomy
and
terrible
in
another
the
poisoned
chalice
the
glittering
dagger
suspended
over
the
head
of
the
sleeper
wizards
and
phantoms
with
terrific
masks
those
halfdim
shadows
more
alarming
than
the
approach
of
fire
or
the
somber
face
of
midnight
these
and
such
as
these
he
had
made
the
companions
of
his
more
pleasing
pictures
no
sooner
had
the
king
entered
his
room
than
a
cold
shiver
seemed
to
pass
through
him
and
on
fouquet
asking
him
the
cause
of
it
the
king
replied
as
pale
as
death
i
am
sleepy
that
is
all
does
your
majesty
wish
for
your
attendants
at
once
no
i
have
to
talk
with
a
few
persons
first
said
the
king
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
m
colbert
i
wish
to
see
him
fouquet
bowed
and
left
the
room
chapter
xiv
a
gascon
and
a
gascon
and
a
half
dartagnan
had
determined
to
lose
no
time
and
in
fact
he
never
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
after
having
inquired
for
aramis
he
had
looked
for
him
in
every
direction
until
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
him
besides
no
sooner
had
the
king
entered
vaux
than
aramis
had
retired
to
his
own
room
meditating
doubtless
some
new
piece
of
gallant
attention
for
his
majestys
amusement
dartagnan
desired
the
servants
to
announce
him
and
found
on
the
second
story
in
a
beautiful
room
called
the
blue
chamber
on
account
of
the
color
of
its
hangings
the
bishop
of
vannes
in
company
with
porthos
and
several
of
the
modern
epicureans
aramis
came
forward
to
embrace
his
friend
and
offered
him
the
best
seat
as
it
was
after
awhile
generally
remarked
among
those
present
that
the
musketeer
was
reserved
and
wished
for
an
opportunity
for
conversing
secretly
with
aramis
the
epicureans
took
their
leave
porthos
however
did
not
stir
for
true
it
is
that
having
dined
exceedingly
well
he
was
fast
asleep
in
his
armchair
and
the
freedom
of
conversation
therefore
was
not
interrupted
by
a
third
person
porthos
had
a
deep
harmonious
snore
and
people
might
talk
in
the
midst
of
its
loud
bass
without
fear
of
disturbing
him
dartagnan
felt
that
he
was
called
upon
to
open
the
conversation
well
and
so
we
have
come
to
vaux
he
said
why
yes
dartagnan
and
how
do
you
like
the
place
very
much
and
i
like
m
fouquet
also
is
he
not
a
charming
host
no
one
could
be
more
so
i
am
told
that
the
king
began
by
showing
great
distance
of
manner
towards
m
fouquet
but
that
his
majesty
grew
much
more
cordial
afterwards
you
did
not
notice
it
then
since
you
say
you
have
been
told
so
no
i
was
engaged
with
the
gentlemen
who
have
just
left
the
room
about
the
theatrical
performances
and
the
tournaments
which
are
to
take
place
tomorrow
ah
indeed
you
are
the
comptrollergeneral
of
the
fetes
here
then
you
know
i
am
a
friend
of
all
kinds
of
amusement
where
the
exercise
of
the
imagination
is
called
into
activity
i
have
always
been
a
poet
in
one
way
or
another
yes
i
remember
the
verses
you
used
to
write
they
were
charming
i
have
forgotten
them
but
i
am
delighted
to
read
the
verses
of
others
when
those
others
are
known
by
the
names
of
moliere
pelisson
la
fontaine
etc
do
you
know
what
idea
occurred
to
me
this
evening
aramis
no
tell
me
what
it
was
for
i
should
never
be
able
to
guess
it
you
have
so
many
well
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
the
true
king
of
france
is
not
louis
xiv
what
said
aramis
involuntarily
looking
the
musketeer
full
in
the
eyes
no
it
is
monsieur
fouquet
aramis
breathed
again
and
smiled
ah
you
are
like
all
the
rest
jealous
he
said
i
would
wager
that
it
was
m
colbert
who
turned
that
pretty
phrase
dartagnan
in
order
to
throw
aramis
off
his
guard
related
colberts
misadventures
with
regard
to
the
vin
de
melun
he
comes
of
a
mean
race
does
colbert
said
aramis
quite
true
when
i
think
too
added
the
bishop
that
that
fellow
will
be
your
minister
within
four
months
and
that
you
will
serve
him
as
blindly
as
you
did
richelieu
or
mazarin
and
as
you
serve
m
fouquet
said
dartagnan
with
this
difference
though
that
m
fouquet
is
not
m
colbert
true
true
said
dartagnan
as
he
pretended
to
become
sad
and
full
of
reflection
and
then
a
moment
after
he
added
why
do
you
tell
me
that
m
colbert
will
be
minister
in
four
months
because
m
fouquet
will
have
ceased
to
be
so
replied
aramis
he
will
be
ruined
you
mean
said
dartagnan
completely
so
why
does
he
give
these
fetes
then
said
the
musketeer
in
a
tone
so
full
of
thoughtful
consideration
and
so
well
assumed
that
the
bishop
was
for
the
moment
deceived
by
it
why
did
you
not
dissuade
him
from
it
the
latter
part
of
the
phrase
was
just
a
little
too
much
and
aramiss
former
suspicions
were
again
aroused
it
is
done
with
the
object
of
humoring
the
king
by
ruining
himself
yes
by
ruining
himself
for
the
king
a
most
eccentric
one
might
say
sinister
calculation
that
necessity
necessity
my
friend
i
dont
see
that
dear
aramis
do
you
not
have
you
not
remarked
m
colberts
daily
increasing
antagonism
and
that
he
is
doing
his
utmost
to
drive
the
king
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
one
must
be
blind
not
to
see
it
and
that
a
cabal
is
already
armed
against
m
fouquet
that
is
well
known
what
likelihood
is
there
that
the
king
would
join
a
party
formed
against
a
man
who
will
have
spent
everything
he
had
to
please
him
true
true
said
dartagnan
slowly
hardly
convinced
yet
curious
to
broach
another
phase
of
the
conversation
there
are
follies
and
follies
he
resumed
and
i
do
not
like
those
you
are
committing
what
do
you
allude
to
as
for
the
banquet
the
ball
the
concert
the
theatricals
the
tournaments
the
cascades
the
fireworks
the
illuminations
and
the
presentsthese
are
well
and
good
i
grant
but
why
were
not
these
expenses
sufficient
why
was
it
necessary
to
have
new
liveries
and
costumes
for
your
whole
household
you
are
quite
right
i
told
m
fouquet
that
myself
he
replied
that
if
he
were
rich
enough
he
would
offer
the
king
a
newly
erected
chateau
from
the
vanes
at
the
houses
to
the
very
subcellars
completely
new
inside
and
out
and
that
as
soon
as
the
king
had
left
he
would
burn
the
whole
building
and
its
contents
in
order
that
it
might
not
be
made
use
of
by
any
one
else
how
completely
spanish
i
told
him
so
and
he
then
added
this
whoever
advises
me
to
spare
expense
i
shall
look
upon
as
my
enemy
it
is
positive
madness
and
that
portrait
too
what
portrait
said
aramis
that
of
the
king
and
the
surprise
as
well
what
surprise
the
surprise
you
seem
to
have
in
view
and
on
account
of
which
you
took
some
specimens
away
when
i
met
you
at
percerins
dartagnan
paused
the
shaft
was
discharged
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
wait
and
watch
its
effect
that
is
merely
an
act
of
graceful
attention
replied
aramis
dartagnan
went
up
to
his
friend
took
hold
of
both
his
hands
and
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
said
aramis
do
you
still
care
for
me
a
very
little
what
a
question
to
ask
very
good
one
favor
then
why
did
you
take
some
patterns
of
the
kings
costumes
at
percerins
come
with
me
and
ask
poor
lebrun
who
has
been
working
upon
them
for
the
last
two
days
and
nights
aramis
that
may
be
truth
for
everybody
else
but
for
me
upon
my
word
dartagnan
you
astonish
me
be
a
little
considerate
tell
me
the
exact
truth
you
would
not
like
anything
disagreeable
to
happen
to
me
would
you
my
dear
friend
you
are
becoming
quite
incomprehensible
what
suspicion
can
you
have
possibly
got
hold
of
do
you
believe
in
my
instinctive
feelings
formerly
you
used
to
have
faith
in
them
well
then
an
instinct
tells
me
that
you
have
some
concealed
project
on
foot
ia
project
i
am
convinced
of
it
what
nonsense
i
am
not
only
sure
of
it
but
i
would
even
swear
it
indeed
dartagnan
you
cause
me
the
greatest
pain
is
it
likely
if
i
have
any
project
in
hand
that
i
ought
to
keep
secret
from
you
i
should
tell
you
about
it
if
i
had
one
that
i
could
and
ought
to
have
revealed
should
i
not
have
long
ago
divulged
it
no
aramis
no
there
are
certain
projects
which
are
never
revealed
until
the
favorable
opportunity
arrives
in
that
case
my
dear
fellow
returned
the
bishop
laughing
the
only
thing
now
is
that
the
opportunity
has
not
yet
arrived
dartagnan
shook
his
head
with
a
sorrowful
expression
oh
friendship
friendship
he
said
what
an
idle
word
you
are
here
is
a
man
who
if
i
were
but
to
ask
it
would
suffer
himself
to
be
cut
in
pieces
for
my
sake
you
are
right
said
aramis
nobly
and
this
man
who
would
shed
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
for
me
will
not
open
up
before
me
the
least
corner
in
his
heart
friendship
i
repeat
is
nothing
but
an
unsubstantial
shadowa
lure
like
everything
else
in
this
bright
dazzling
world
it
is
not
thus
you
should
speak
of
our
friendship
replied
the
bishop
in
a
firm
assured
voice
for
ours
is
not
of
the
same
nature
as
those
of
which
you
have
been
speaking
look
at
us
aramis
three
out
of
the
old
four
you
are
deceiving
me
i
suspect
you
and
porthos
is
fast
asleep
an
admirable
trio
of
friends
dont
you
think
so
what
an
affecting
relic
of
the
former
dear
old
times
i
can
only
tell
you
one
thing
dartagnan
and
i
swear
it
on
the
bible
i
love
you
just
as
i
used
to
do
if
i
ever
suspect
you
it
is
on
account
of
others
and
not
on
account
of
either
of
us
in
everything
i
may
do
and
should
happen
to
succeed
in
you
will
find
your
fourth
will
you
promise
me
the
same
favor
if
i
am
not
mistaken
aramis
your
wordsat
the
moment
you
pronounce
themare
full
of
generous
feeling
such
a
thing
is
very
possible
you
are
conspiring
against
m
colbert
if
that
be
all
mordioux
tell
me
so
at
once
i
have
the
instrument
in
my
own
hand
and
will
pull
out
the
tooth
easily
enough
aramis
could
not
conceal
a
smile
of
disdain
that
flitted
over
his
haughty
features
and
supposing
that
i
were
conspiring
against
colbert
what
harm
would
there
be
in
that
no
no
that
would
be
too
trifling
a
matter
for
you
to
take
in
hand
and
it
was
not
on
that
account
you
asked
percerin
for
those
patterns
of
the
kings
costumes
oh
aramis
we
are
not
enemies
rememberwe
are
brothers
tell
me
what
you
wish
to
undertake
and
upon
the
word
of
a
dartagnan
if
i
cannot
help
you
i
will
swear
to
remain
neuter
i
am
undertaking
nothing
said
aramis
aramis
a
voice
within
me
speaks
and
seems
to
trickle
forth
a
rill
of
light
within
my
darkness
it
is
a
voice
that
has
never
yet
deceived
me
it
is
the
king
you
are
conspiring
against
the
king
exclaimed
the
bishop
pretending
to
be
annoyed
your
face
will
not
convince
me
the
king
i
repeat
will
you
help
me
said
aramis
smiling
ironically
aramis
i
will
do
more
than
help
youi
will
do
more
than
remain
neuteri
will
save
you
you
are
mad
dartagnan
i
am
the
wiser
of
the
two
in
this
matter
you
to
suspect
me
of
wishing
to
assassinate
the
king
who
spoke
of
such
a
thing
smiled
the
musketeer
well
let
us
understand
one
another
i
do
not
see
what
any
one
can
do
to
a
legitimate
king
as
ours
is
if
he
does
not
assassinate
him
dartagnan
did
not
say
a
word
besides
you
have
your
guards
and
your
musketeers
here
said
the
bishop
true
you
are
not
in
m
fouquets
house
but
in
your
own
true
but
in
spite
of
that
aramis
grant
me
for
pitys
sake
one
single
word
of
a
true
friend
a
true
friends
word
is
ever
truth
itself
if
i
think
of
touching
even
with
my
finger
the
son
of
anne
of
austria
the
true
king
of
this
realm
of
franceif
i
have
not
the
firm
intention
of
prostrating
myself
before
his
throneif
in
every
idea
i
may
entertain
tomorrow
here
at
vaux
will
not
be
the
most
glorious
day
my
king
ever
enjoyedmay
heavens
lightning
blast
me
where
i
stand
aramis
had
pronounced
these
words
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
alcove
of
his
own
bedroom
where
dartagnan
seated
with
his
back
towards
the
alcove
could
not
suspect
that
any
one
was
lying
concealed
the
earnestness
of
his
words
the
studied
slowness
with
which
he
pronounced
them
the
solemnity
of
his
oath
gave
the
musketeer
the
most
complete
satisfaction
he
took
hold
of
both
aramiss
hands
and
shook
them
cordially
aramis
had
endured
reproaches
without
turning
pale
and
had
blushed
as
he
listened
to
words
of
praise
dartagnan
deceived
did
him
honor
but
dartagnan
trustful
and
reliant
made
him
feel
ashamed
are
you
going
away
he
said
as
he
embraced
him
in
order
to
conceal
the
flush
on
his
face
yes
duty
summons
me
i
have
to
get
the
watchword
it
seems
i
am
to
be
lodged
in
the
kings
anteroom
where
does
porthos
sleep
take
him
away
with
you
if
you
like
for
he
rumbles
through
his
sleepy
nose
like
a
park
of
artillery
ah
he
does
not
stay
with
you
then
said
dartagnan
not
the
least
in
the
world
he
has
a
chamber
to
himself
but
i
dont
know
where
very
good
said
the
musketeer
from
whom
this
separation
of
the
two
associates
removed
his
last
suspicion
and
he
touched
porthos
lightly
on
the
shoulder
the
latter
replied
by
a
loud
yawn
come
said
dartagnan
what
dartagnan
my
dear
fellow
is
that
you
what
a
lucky
chance
oh
yestrue
i
have
forgotten
i
am
at
the
fete
at
vaux
yes
and
your
beautiful
dress
too
yes
it
was
very
attentive
on
the
part
of
monsieur
coquelin
de
voliere
was
it
not
hush
said
aramis
you
are
walking
so
heavily
you
will
make
the
flooring
give
way
true
said
the
musketeer
this
room
is
above
the
dome
i
think
and
i
did
not
choose
it
for
a
fencingroom
i
assure
you
added
the
bishop
the
ceiling
of
the
kings
room
has
all
the
lightness
and
calm
of
wholesome
sleep
do
not
forget
therefore
that
my
flooring
is
merely
the
covering
of
his
ceiling
good
night
my
friends
and
in
ten
minutes
i
shall
be
asleep
myself
and
aramis
accompanied
them
to
the
door
laughing
quietly
all
the
while
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
he
bolted
the
door
hurriedly
closed
up
the
chinks
of
the
windows
and
then
called
out
monseigneurmonseigneur
philippe
made
his
appearance
from
the
alcove
as
he
pushed
aside
a
sliding
panel
placed
behind
the
bed
m
dartagnan
entertains
a
great
many
suspicions
it
seems
he
said
ahyou
recognized
m
dartagnan
then
before
you
called
him
by
his
name
even
he
is
your
captain
of
musketeers
he
is
very
devoted
to
me
replied
philippe
laying
a
stress
upon
the
personal
pronoun
as
faithful
as
a
dog
but
he
bites
sometimes
if
dartagnan
does
not
recognize
you
before
the
other
has
disappeared
rely
upon
dartagnan
to
the
end
of
the
world
for
in
that
case
if
he
has
seen
nothing
he
will
keep
his
fidelity
if
he
sees
when
it
is
too
late
he
is
a
gascon
and
will
never
admit
that
he
has
been
deceived
i
thought
so
what
are
we
to
do
now
sit
in
this
foldingchair
i
am
going
to
push
aside
a
portion
of
the
flooring
you
will
look
through
the
opening
which
answers
to
one
of
the
false
windows
made
in
the
dome
of
the
kings
apartment
can
you
see
yes
said
philippe
starting
as
at
the
sight
of
an
enemy
i
see
the
king
what
is
he
doing
he
seems
to
wish
some
man
to
sit
down
close
to
him
m
fouquet
no
no
wait
a
moment
look
at
the
notes
and
the
portraits
my
prince
the
man
whom
the
king
wishes
to
sit
down
in
his
presence
is
m
colbert
colbert
sit
down
in
the
kings
presence
exclaimed
aramis
it
is
impossible
look
aramis
looked
through
the
opening
in
the
flooring
yes
he
said
colbert
himself
oh
monseigneur
what
can
we
be
going
to
hearand
what
can
result
from
this
intimacy
nothing
good
for
m
fouquet
at
all
events
the
prince
did
not
deceive
himself
we
have
seen
that
louis
xiv
had
sent
for
colbert
and
colbert
had
arrived
the
conversation
began
between
them
by
the
king
according
to
him
one
of
the
highest
favors
that
he
had
ever
done
it
was
true
the
king
was
alone
with
his
subject
colbert
said
he
sit
down
the
intendant
overcome
with
delight
for
he
feared
he
was
about
to
be
dismissed
refused
this
unprecedented
honor
does
he
accept
said
aramis
no
he
remains
standing
let
us
listen
then
and
the
future
king
and
the
future
pope
listened
eagerly
to
the
simple
mortals
they
held
under
their
feet
ready
to
crush
them
when
they
liked
colbert
said
the
king
you
have
annoyed
me
exceedingly
today
i
know
it
sire
very
good
i
like
that
answer
yes
you
knew
it
and
there
was
courage
in
the
doing
of
it
i
ran
the
risk
of
displeasing
your
majesty
but
i
risked
also
the
concealment
of
your
best
interests
what
you
were
afraid
of
something
on
my
account
i
was
sire
even
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
an
indigestion
said
colbert
for
people
do
not
give
their
sovereigns
such
banquets
as
the
one
of
today
unless
it
be
to
stifle
them
beneath
the
burden
of
good
living
colbert
awaited
the
effect
this
coarse
jest
would
produce
upon
the
king
and
louis
xiv
who
was
the
vainest
and
the
most
fastidiously
delicate
man
in
his
kingdom
forgave
colbert
the
joke
the
truth
is
he
said
that
m
fouquet
has
given
me
too
good
a
meal
tell
me
colbert
where
does
he
get
all
the
money
required
for
this
enormous
expenditurecan
you
tell
yes
i
do
know
sire
will
you
be
able
to
prove
it
with
tolerable
certainty
easily
and
to
the
utmost
farthing
i
know
you
are
very
exact
exactitude
is
the
principal
qualification
required
in
an
intendant
of
finances
but
all
are
not
so
i
thank
you
majesty
for
so
flattering
a
compliment
from
your
own
lips
m
fouquet
therefore
is
richvery
rich
and
i
suppose
every
man
knows
he
is
so
every
one
sire
the
living
as
well
as
the
dead
what
does
that
mean
monsieur
colbert
the
living
are
witnesses
of
m
fouquets
wealththey
admire
and
applaud
the
result
produced
but
the
dead
wiser
and
better
informed
than
we
are
know
how
that
wealth
was
obtainedand
they
rise
up
in
accusation
so
that
m
fouquet
owes
his
wealth
to
some
cause
or
other
the
occupation
of
an
intendant
very
often
favors
those
who
practice
it
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
more
confidentially
i
perceive
do
not
be
afraid
we
are
quite
alone
i
am
never
afraid
of
anything
under
the
shelter
of
my
own
conscience
and
under
the
protection
of
your
majesty
said
colbert
bowing
if
the
dead
therefore
were
to
speak
they
do
speak
sometimes
sireread
ah
murmured
aramis
in
the
princes
ear
who
close
beside
him
listened
without
losing
a
syllable
since
you
are
placed
here
monseigneur
in
order
to
learn
your
vocation
of
a
king
listen
to
a
piece
of
infamyof
a
nature
truly
royal
you
are
about
to
be
a
witness
of
one
of
those
scenes
which
the
foul
fiend
alone
conceives
and
executes
listen
attentivelyyou
will
find
your
advantage
in
it
the
prince
redoubled
his
attention
and
saw
louis
xiv
take
from
colberts
hands
a
letter
the
latter
held
out
to
him
the
late
cardinals
handwriting
said
the
king
your
majesty
has
an
excellent
memory
replied
colbert
bowing
it
is
an
immense
advantage
for
a
king
who
is
destined
for
hard
work
to
recognize
handwritings
at
the
first
glance
the
king
read
mazarins
letter
and
as
its
contents
are
already
known
to
the
reader
in
consequence
of
the
misunderstanding
between
madame
de
chevreuse
and
aramis
nothing
further
would
be
learned
if
we
stated
them
here
again
i
do
not
quite
understand
said
the
king
greatly
interested
your
majesty
has
not
acquired
the
utilitarian
habit
of
checking
the
public
accounts
i
see
that
it
refers
to
money
that
had
been
given
to
m
fouquet
thirteen
millions
a
tolerably
good
sum
yes
well
these
thirteen
millions
are
wanting
to
balance
the
total
of
the
account
that
is
what
i
do
not
very
well
understand
how
was
this
deficit
possible
possible
i
do
not
say
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
fact
that
it
is
really
so
you
say
that
these
thirteen
millions
are
found
to
be
wanting
in
the
accounts
i
do
not
say
so
but
the
registry
does
and
this
letter
of
m
mazarin
indicates
the
employment
of
that
sum
and
the
name
of
the
person
with
whom
it
was
deposited
as
your
majesty
can
judge
for
yourself
yes
and
the
result
is
then
that
m
fouquet
has
not
yet
restored
the
thirteen
millions
that
results
from
the
accounts
certainly
sire
well
and
consequently
well
sire
in
that
case
inasmuch
as
m
fouquet
has
not
yet
given
back
the
thirteen
millions
he
must
have
appropriated
them
to
his
own
purpose
and
with
those
thirteen
millions
one
could
incur
four
times
and
a
little
more
as
much
expense
and
make
four
times
as
great
a
display
as
your
majesty
was
able
to
do
at
fontainebleau
where
we
only
spent
three
millions
altogether
if
you
remember
for
a
blunderer
the
souvenir
he
had
evoked
was
a
rather
skillfully
contrived
piece
of
baseness
for
by
the
remembrance
of
his
own
fete
he
for
the
first
time
perceived
its
inferiority
compared
with
that
of
fouquet
colbert
received
back
again
at
vaux
what
fouquet
had
given
him
at
fontainebleau
and
as
a
good
financier
returned
it
with
the
best
possible
interest
having
once
disposed
the
kings
mind
in
this
artful
way
colbert
had
nothing
of
much
importance
to
detain
him
he
felt
that
such
was
the
case
for
the
king
too
had
again
sunk
into
a
dull
and
gloomy
state
colbert
awaited
the
first
words
from
the
kings
lips
with
as
much
impatience
as
philippe
and
aramis
did
from
their
place
of
observation
are
you
aware
what
is
the
usual
and
natural
consequence
of
all
this
monsieur
colbert
said
the
king
after
a
few
moments
reflection
no
sire
i
do
not
know
well
then
the
fact
of
the
appropriation
of
the
thirteen
millions
if
it
can
be
proved
but
it
is
so
already
i
mean
if
it
were
to
be
declared
and
certified
m
colbert
i
think
it
will
be
tomorrow
if
your
majesty
were
we
not
under
m
fouquets
roof
you
were
going
to
say
perhaps
replied
the
king
with
something
of
nobility
in
his
demeanor
the
king
is
in
his
own
palace
wherever
he
may
beespecially
in
houses
which
the
royal
money
has
constructed
i
think
said
philippe
in
a
low
tone
to
aramis
that
the
architect
who
planned
this
dome
ought
anticipating
the
use
it
could
be
put
to
at
a
future
opportunity
so
to
have
contrived
that
it
might
be
made
to
fall
upon
the
heads
of
scoundrels
such
as
m
colbert
i
think
so
too
replied
aramis
but
m
colbert
is
so
very
near
the
king
at
this
moment
that
is
true
and
that
would
open
the
succession
of
which
your
younger
brother
would
reap
all
the
advantage
monseigneur
but
stay
let
us
keep
quiet
and
go
on
listening
we
shall
not
have
long
to
listen
said
the
young
prince
why
not
monseigneur
because
if
i
were
king
i
should
make
no
further
reply
and
what
would
you
do
i
should
wait
until
tomorrow
morning
to
give
myself
time
for
reflection
louis
xiv
at
last
raised
his
eyes
and
finding
colbert
attentively
waiting
for
his
next
remarks
said
hastily
changing
the
conversation
m
colbert
i
perceive
it
is
getting
very
late
and
i
shall
now
retire
to
bed
by
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
have
made
up
my
mind
very
good
sire
returned
colbert
greatly
incensed
although
he
restrained
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
king
the
king
made
a
gesture
of
adieu
and
colbert
withdrew
with
a
respectful
bow
my
attendants
cried
the
king
and
as
they
entered
the
apartment
philippe
was
about
to
quit
his
post
of
observation
a
moment
longer
said
aramis
to
him
with
his
accustomed
gentleness
of
manner
what
has
just
now
taken
place
is
only
a
detail
and
tomorrow
we
shall
have
no
occasion
to
think
anything
more
about
it
but
the
ceremony
of
the
kings
retiring
to
rest
the
etiquette
observed
in
addressing
the
king
that
indeed
is
of
the
greatest
importance
learn
sire
and
study
well
how
you
ought
to
go
to

colbert
history
will
tell
us
or
rather
history
has
told
us
of
the
various
events
of
the
following
day
of
the
splendid
fetes
given
by
the
surintendant
to
his
sovereign
nothing
but
amusement
and
delight
was
allowed
to
prevail
throughout
the
whole
of
the
following
day
there
was
a
promenade
a
banquet
a
comedy
to
be
acted
and
a
comedy
too
in
which
to
his
great
amazement
porthos
recognized
m
coquelin
de
voliere
as
one
of
the
actors
in
the
piece
called
les
facheux
full
of
preoccupation
however
from
the
scene
of
the
previous
evening
and
hardly
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
poison
which
colbert
had
then
administered
to
him
the
king
during
the
whole
of
the
day
so
brilliant
in
its
effects
so
full
of
unexpected
and
startling
novelties
in
which
all
the
wonders
of
the
arabian
nights
entertainments
seemed
to
be
reproduced
for
his
especial
amusementthe
king
we
say
showed
himself
cold
reserved
and
taciturn
nothing
could
smooth
the
frowns
upon
his
face
every
one
who
observed
him
noticed
that
a
deep
feeling
of
resentment
of
remote
origin
increased
by
slow
degrees
as
the
source
becomes
a
river
thanks
to
the
thousand
threads
of
water
that
increase
its
body
was
keenly
alive
in
the
depths
of
the
kings
heart
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
only
did
he
begin
to
resume
a
little
serenity
of
manner
and
by
that
time
he
had
in
all
probability
made
up
his
mind
aramis
who
followed
him
step
by
step
in
his
thoughts
as
in
his
walk
concluded
that
the
event
he
was
expecting
would
not
be
long
before
it
was
announced
this
time
colbert
seemed
to
walk
in
concert
with
the
bishop
of
vannes
and
had
he
received
for
every
annoyance
which
he
inflicted
on
the
king
a
word
of
direction
from
aramis
he
could
not
have
done
better
during
the
whole
of
the
day
the
king
who
in
all
probability
wished
to
free
himself
from
some
of
the
thoughts
which
disturbed
his
mind
seemed
to
seek
la
vallieres
society
as
actively
as
he
seemed
to
show
his
anxiety
to
flee
that
of
m
colbert
or
m
fouquet
the
evening
came
the
king
had
expressed
a
wish
not
to
walk
in
the
park
until
after
cards
in
the
evening
in
the
interval
between
supper
and
the
promenade
cards
and
dice
were
introduced
the
king
won
a
thousand
pistoles
and
having
won
them
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
then
rose
saying
and
now
gentlemen
to
the
park
he
found
the
ladies
of
the
court
were
already
there
the
king
we
have
before
observed
had
won
a
thousand
pistoles
and
had
put
them
in
his
pocket
but
m
fouquet
had
somehow
contrived
to
lose
ten
thousand
so
that
among
the
courtiers
there
was
still
left
a
hundred
and
ninety
thousand
francs
profit
to
divide
a
circumstance
which
made
the
countenances
of
the
courtiers
and
the
officers
of
the
kings
household
the
most
joyous
countenances
in
the
world
it
was
not
the
same
however
with
the
kings
face
for
notwithstanding
his
success
at
play
to
which
he
was
by
no
means
insensible
there
still
remained
a
slight
shade
of
dissatisfaction
colbert
was
waiting
for
or
upon
him
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
avenues
he
was
most
probably
waiting
there
in
consequence
of
a
rendezvous
which
had
been
given
him
by
the
king
as
louis
xiv
who
had
avoided
him
or
who
had
seemed
to
avoid
him
suddenly
made
him
a
sign
and
they
then
struck
into
the
depths
of
the
park
together
but
la
valliere
too
had
observed
the
kings
gloomy
aspect
and
kindling
glances
she
had
remarked
thisand
as
nothing
which
lay
hidden
or
smoldering
in
his
heart
was
hidden
from
the
gaze
of
her
affection
she
understood
that
this
repressed
wrath
menaced
some
one
she
prepared
to
withstand
the
current
of
his
vengeance
and
intercede
like
an
angel
of
mercy
overcome
by
sadness
nervously
agitated
deeply
distressed
at
having
been
so
long
separated
from
her
lover
disturbed
at
the
sight
of
the
emotion
she
had
divined
she
accordingly
presented
herself
to
the
king
with
an
embarrassed
aspect
which
in
his
then
disposition
of
mind
the
king
interpreted
unfavorably
then
as
they
were
alonenearly
alone
inasmuch
as
colbert
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
young
girl
approaching
had
stopped
and
drawn
back
a
dozen
pacesthe
king
advanced
towards
la
valliere
and
took
her
by
the
hand
mademoiselle
he
said
to
her
should
i
be
guilty
of
an
indiscretion
if
i
were
to
inquire
if
you
were
indisposed
for
you
seem
to
breathe
as
if
you
were
oppressed
by
some
secret
cause
of
uneasiness
and
your
eyes
are
filled
with
tears
oh
sire
if
i
be
indeed
so
and
if
my
eyes
are
indeed
full
of
tears
i
am
sorrowful
only
at
the
sadness
which
seems
to
oppress
your
majesty
my
sadness
you
are
mistaken
mademoiselle
no
it
is
not
sadness
i
experience
what
is
it
then
sire
humiliation
humiliation
oh
sire
what
a
word
for
you
to
use
i
mean
mademoiselle
that
wherever
i
may
happen
to
be
no
one
else
ought
to
be
the
master
well
then
look
round
you
on
every
side
and
judge
whether
i
am
not
eclipsedi
the
king
of
francebefore
the
monarch
of
these
wide
domains
oh
he
continued
clenching
his
hands
and
teeth
when
i
think
that
this
king
well
sire
said
louise
terrified
that
this
king
is
a
faithless
unworthy
servant
who
grows
proud
and
selfsufficient
upon
the
strength
of
property
that
belongs
to
me
and
which
he
has
stolen
and
therefore
i
am
about
to
change
this
impudent
ministers
fete
into
sorrow
and
mourning
of
which
the
nymph
of
vaux
as
the
poets
say
shall
not
soon
lose
the
remembrance
oh
your
majesty
well
mademoiselle
are
you
about
to
take
m
fouquets
part
said
louis
impatiently
no
sire
i
will
only
ask
whether
you
are
well
informed
your
majesty
has
more
than
once
learned
the
value
of
accusations
made
at
court
louis
xiv
made
a
sign
for
colbert
to
approach
speak
monsieur
colbert
said
the
young
prince
for
i
almost
believe
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
has
need
of
your
assistance
before
she
can
put
any
faith
in
the
kings
word
tell
mademoiselle
what
m
fouquet
has
done
and
you
mademoiselle
will
perhaps
have
the
kindness
to
listen
it
will
not
be
long
why
did
louis
xiv
insist
upon
it
in
such
a
manner
a
very
simple
reasonhis
heart
was
not
at
rest
his
mind
was
not
thoroughly
convinced
he
imagined
there
lay
some
dark
hidden
tortuous
intrigue
behind
these
thirteen
millions
of
francs
and
he
wished
that
the
pure
heart
of
la
valliere
which
had
revolted
at
the
idea
of
theft
or
robbery
should
approveeven
were
it
only
by
a
single
wordthe
resolution
he
had
taken
and
which
nevertheless
he
hesitated
before
carrying
into
execution
speak
monsieur
said
la
valliere
to
colbert
who
had
advanced
speak
since
the
king
wishes
me
to
listen
to
you
tell
me
what
is
the
crime
with
which
m
fouquet
is
charged
oh
not
very
heinous
mademoiselle
he
returned
a
mere
abuse
of
confidence
speak
speak
colbert
and
when
you
have
related
it
leave
us
and
go
and
inform
m
dartagnan
that
i
have
certain
orders
to
give
him
m
dartagnan
sire
exclaimed
la
valliere
but
why
send
for
m
dartagnan
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
pardieu
in
order
to
arrest
this
haughty
arrogant
titan
who
true
to
his
menace
threatens
to
scale
my
heaven
arrest
m
fouquet
do
you
say
ah
does
that
surprise
you
in
his
own
house
why
not
if
he
be
guilty
he
is
as
guilty
in
his
own
house
as
anywhere
else
m
fouquet
who
at
this
moment
is
ruining
himself
for
his
sovereign
in
plain
truth
mademoiselle
it
seems
as
if
you
were
defending
this
traitor
colbert
began
to
chuckle
silently
the
king
turned
round
at
the
sound
of
this
suppressed
mirth
sire
said
la
valliere
it
is
not
m
fouquet
i
am
defending
it
is
yourself
me
you
are
defending
me
sire
you
would
dishonor
yourself
if
you
were
to
give
such
an
order
dishonor
myself
murmured
the
king
turning
pale
with
anger
in
plain
truth
mademoiselle
you
show
a
strange
persistence
in
what
you
say
if
i
do
sire
my
only
motive
is
that
of
serving
your
majesty
replied
the
noblehearted
girl
for
that
i
would
risk
i
would
sacrifice
my
very
life
without
the
least
reserve
colbert
seemed
inclined
to
grumble
and
complain
la
valliere
that
timid
gentle
lamb
turned
round
upon
him
and
with
a
glance
like
lightning
imposed
silence
upon
him
monsieur
she
said
when
the
king
acts
well
whether
in
doing
so
he
does
either
myself
or
those
who
belong
to
me
an
injury
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
were
the
king
to
confer
a
benefit
either
upon
me
or
mine
and
if
he
acted
badly
i
should
tell
him
so
but
it
appears
to
me
mademoiselle
colbert
ventured
to
say
that
i
too
love
the
king
yes
monseigneur
we
both
love
him
but
each
in
a
different
manner
replied
la
valliere
with
such
an
accent
that
the
heart
of
the
young
king
was
powerfully
affected
by
it
i
love
him
so
deeply
that
the
whole
world
is
aware
of
it
so
purely
that
the
king
himself
does
not
doubt
my
affection
he
is
my
king
and
my
master
i
am
the
least
of
all
his
servants
but
whoso
touches
his
honor
assails
my
life
therefore
i
repeat
that
they
dishonor
the
king
who
advise
him
to
arrest
m
fouquet
under
his
own
roof
colbert
hung
down
his
head
for
he
felt
that
the
king
had
abandoned
him
however
as
he
bent
his
head
he
murmured
mademoiselle
i
have
only
one
word
to
say
do
not
say
it
then
monsieur
for
i
would
not
listen
to
it
besides
what
could
you
have
to
tell
me
that
m
fouquet
has
been
guilty
of
certain
crimes
i
believe
he
has
because
the
king
has
said
so
and
from
the
moment
the
king
said
i
think
so
i
have
no
occasion
for
other
lips
to
say
i
affirm
it
but
were
m
fouquet
the
vilest
of
men
i
should
say
aloud
m
fouquets
person
is
sacred
to
the
king
because
he
is
the
guest
of
m
fouquet
were
his
house
a
den
of
thieves
were
vaux
a
cave
of
coiners
or
robbers
his
home
is
sacred
his
palace
is
inviolable

his

is

that

not
dare
to
violate
la
valliere
paused
and
was
silent
in
spite
of
himself
the
king
could
not
but
admire
her
he
was
overpowered
by
the
passionate
energy
of
her
voice
by
the
nobleness
of
the
cause
she
advocated
colbert
yielded
overcome
by
the
inequality
of
the
struggle
at
last
the
king
breathed
again
more
freely
shook
his
head
and
held
out
his
hand
to
la
valliere
mademoiselle
he
said
gently
why
do
you
decide
against
me
do
you
know
what
this
wretched
fellow
will
do
if
i
give
him
time
to
breathe
again
is
he
not
a
prey
which
will
always
be
within
your
grasp
should
he
escape
and
take
to
flight
exclaimed
colbert
well
monsieur
it
will
always
remain
on
record
to
the
kings
eternal
honor
that
he
allowed
m
fouquet
to
flee
and
the
more
guilty
he
may
have
been
the
greater
will
the
kings
honor
and
glory
appear
compared
with
such
unnecessary
misery
and
shame

kissed

as
he
knelt
before

colbert
then
suddenly
his
face
brightened
up
again
oh
no
no
aha
old
foxnot
yet
he
said
to
himself
and
while
the
king
protected
from
observation
by
the
thick
covert
of
an
enormous
lime
pressed
la
valliere
to
his
breast
with
all
the
ardor
of
ineffable
affection
colbert
tranquilly
fumbled
among
the
papers
in
his
pocketbook
and
drew
out
of
it
a
paper
folded
in
the
form
of
a
letter
somewhat
yellow
perhaps
but
one
that
must
have
been
most
precious
since
the
intendant
smiled
as
he
looked
at
it
he
then
bent
a
look
full
of
hatred
upon
the
charming
group
which
the
young
girl
and
the
king
formed
togethera
group
revealed
but
for
a
moment
as
the
light
of
the
approaching
torches
shone
upon

to

departure
louise
disappeared
rapidly
among
the
trees
and
then
as
the
king
who
had
been
on
his
knees
before
the
young
girl
was
rising
from
his
humble
posture
colbert
exclaimed
ah
mademoiselle

sire
the
king
stooped
down
immediately
and
picked
up
the
letter
crumpling
it
in
his
hand
as
he
did
so
and
at
the
same
moment
the
torches
arrived
inundating
the
blackness
of
the
scene
with
a
flood
of

jealousy
the
torches
we
have
just
referred
to
the
eager
attention
every
one
displayed
and
the
new
ovation
paid
to
the
king
by
fouquet
arrived
in
time
to
suspend
the
effect
of
a
resolution
which
la
valliere
had
already
considerably
shaken
in
louis
xivs
heart
he
looked
at
fouquet
with
a
feeling
almost
of
gratitude
for
having
given
la
valliere
an
opportunity
of
showing
herself
so
generously
disposed
so
powerful
in
the
influence
she
exercised
over
his
heart
the
moment
of
the
last
and
greatest
display
had
arrived
hardly
had
fouquet
conducted
the
king
towards
the
chateau
when
a
mass
of
fire
burst
from
the
dome
of
vaux
with
a
prodigious
uproar
pouring
a
flood
of
dazzling
cataracts
of
rays
on
every
side
and
illumining
the
remotest
corners
of
the
gardens
the
fireworks
began
colbert
at
twenty
paces
from
the
king
who
was
surrounded
and
feted
by
the
owner
of
vaux
seemed
by
the
obstinate
persistence
of
his
gloomy
thoughts
to
do
his
utmost
to
recall
louiss
attention
which
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
was
already
in
his
opinion
too
easily
diverting
suddenly
just
as
louis
was
on
the
point
of
holding
it
out
to
fouquet
he
perceived
in
his
hand
the
paper
which
as
he
believed
la
valliere
had
dropped
at
his
feet
as
she
hurried
away
the
still
stronger
magnet
of
love
drew
the
young
princes
attention
towards
the
souvenir
of
his
idol
and
by
the
brilliant
light
which
increased
momentarily
in
beauty
and
drew
from
the
neighboring
villages
loud
cheers
of
admiration
the
king
read
the
letter
which
he
supposed
was
a
loving
and
tender
epistle
la
valliere
had
destined
for
him
but
as
he
read
it
a
deathlike
pallor
stole
over
his
face
and
an
expression
of
deepseated
wrath
illumined
by
the
manycolored
fire
which
gleamed
so
brightly
soaringly
around
the
scene
produced
a
terrible
spectacle
which
every
one
would
have
shuddered
at
could
they
only
have
read
into
his
heart
now
torn
by
the
most
stormy
and
most
bitter
passions
there
was
no
truce
for
him
now
influenced
as
he
was
by
jealousy
and
mad
passion
from
the
very
moment
when
the
dark
truth
was
revealed
to
him
every
gentler
feeling
seemed
to
disappear
pity
kindness
of
consideration
the
religion
of
hospitality
all
were
forgotten
in
the
bitter
pang
which
wrung
his
heart
he
still
too
weak
to
hide
his
sufferings
was
almost
on
the
point
of
uttering
a
cry
of
alarm
and
calling
his
guards
to
gather
round
him
this
letter
which
colbert
had
thrown
down
at
the
kings
feet
the
reader
has
doubtlessly
guessed
was
the
same
that
had
disappeared
with
the
porter
toby
at
fontainebleau
after
the
attempt
which
fouquet
had
made
upon
la
vallieres
heart
fouquet
saw
the
kings
pallor
and
was
far
from
guessing
the
evil
colbert
saw
the
kings
anger
and
rejoiced
inwardly
at
the
approach
of
the
storm
fouquets
voice
drew
the
young
prince
from
his
wrathful
reverie
what
is
the
matter
sire
inquired
the
superintendent
with
an
expression
of
graceful
interest
louis
made
a
violent
effort
over
himself
as
he
replied
nothing
i
am
afraid
your
majesty
is
suffering
i
am
suffering
and
have
already
told
you
so
monsieur
but
it
is
nothing
and
the
king
without
waiting
for
the
termination
of
the
fireworks
turned
towards
the
chateau
fouquet
accompanied
him
and
the
whole
court
followed
leaving
the
remains
of
the
fireworks
consuming
for
their
own
amusement
the
superintendent
endeavored
again
to
question
louis
xiv
but
did
not
succeed
in
obtaining
a
reply
he
imagined
there
had
been
some
misunderstanding
between
louis
and
la
valliere
in
the
park
which
had
resulted
in
a
slight
quarrel
and
that
the
king
who
was
not
ordinarily
sulky
by
disposition
but
completely
absorbed
by
his
passion
for
la
valliere
had
taken
a
dislike
to
every
one
because
his
mistress
had
shown
herself
offended
with
him
this
idea
was
sufficient
to
console
him
he
had
even
a
friendly
and
kindly
smile
for
the
young
king
when
the
latter
wished
him
good
night
this
however
was
not
all
the
king
had
to
submit
to
he
was
obliged
to
undergo
the
usual
ceremony
which
on
that
evening
was
marked
by
close
adherence
to
the
strictest
etiquette
the
next
day
was
the
one
fixed
for
the
departure
it
was
but
proper
that
the
guests
should
thank
their
host
and
show
him
a
little
attention
in
return
for
the
expenditure
of
his
twelve
millions
the
only
remark
approaching
to
amiability
which
the
king
could
find
to
say
to
m
fouquet
as
he
took
leave
of
him
were
in
these
words
m
fouquet
you
shall
hear
from
me
be
good
enough
to
desire
m
dartagnan
to
come
here
but
the
blood
of
louis
xiv
who
had
so
profoundly
dissimulated
his
feelings
boiled
in
his
veins
and
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
order
m
fouquet
to
be
put
an
end
to
with
the
same
readiness
indeed
as
his
predecessor
had
caused
the
assassination
of
le
marechal
dancre
and
so
he
disguised
the
terrible
resolution
he
had
formed
beneath
one
of
those
royal
smiles
which
like
lightningflashes
indicated
coups
detat
fouquet
took
the
kings
hand
and
kissed
it
louis
shuddered
throughout
his
whole
frame
but
allowed
m
fouquet
to
touch
his
hand
with
his
lips
five
minutes
afterwards
dartagnan
to
whom
the
royal
order
had
been
communicated
entered
louis
xivs
apartment
aramis
and
philippe
were
in
theirs
still
eagerly
attentive
and
still
listening
with
all
their
ears
the
king
did
not
even
give
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
time
to
approach
his
armchair
but
ran
forward
to
meet
him
take
care
he
exclaimed
that
no
one
enters
here
very
good
sire
replied
the
captain
whose
glance
had
for
a
long
time
past
analyzed
the
stormy
indications
on
the
royal
countenance
he
gave
the
necessary
order
at
the
door
but
returning
to
the
king
he
said
is
there
something
fresh
the
matter
your
majesty
how
many
men
have
you
here
inquired
the
king
without
making
any
other
reply
to
the
question
addressed
to
him
what
for
sire
how
many
men
have
you
i
say
repeated
the
king
stamping
upon
the
ground
with
his
foot
i
have
the
musketeers
well
and
what
others
twenty
guards
and
thirteen
swiss
how
many
men
will
be
required
to
to
do
what
sire
replied
the
musketeer
opening
his
large
calm
eyes
to
arrest
m
fouquet
dartagnan
fell
back
a
step
to
arrest
m
fouquet
he
burst
forth
are
you
going
to
tell
me
that
it
is
impossible
exclaimed
the
king
in
tones
of
cold
vindictive
passion
i
never
say
that
anything
is
impossible
replied
dartagnan
wounded
to
the
quick
very
well
do
it
then
dartagnan
turned
on
his
heel
and
made
his
way
towards
the
door
it
was
but
a
short
distance
and
he
cleared
it
in
half
a
dozen
paces
when
he
reached
it
he
suddenly
paused
and
said
your
majesty
will
forgive
me
but
in
order
to
effect
this
arrest
i
should
like
written
directions
for
what
purposeand
since
when
has
the
kings
word
been
insufficient
for
you
because
the
word
of
a
king
when
it
springs
from
a
feeling
of
anger
may
possibly
change
when
the
feeling
changes
a
truce
to
set
phrases
monsieur
you
have
another
thought
besides
that
oh
i
at
least
have
certain
thoughts
and
ideas
which
unfortunately
others
have
not
dartagnan
replied
impertinently
the
king
in
the
tempest
of
his
wrath
hesitated
and
drew
back
in
the
face
of
dartagnans
frank
courage
just
as
a
horse
crouches
on
his
haunches
under
the
strong
hand
of
a
bold
and
experienced
rider
what
is
your
thought
he
exclaimed
this
sire
replied
dartagnan
you
cause
a
man
to
be
arrested
when
you
are
still
under
his
roof
and
passion
is
alone
the
cause
of
that
when
your
anger
shall
have
passed
you
will
regret
what
you
have
done
and
then
i
wish
to
be
in
a
position
to
show
you
your
signature
if
that
however
should
fail
to
be
a
reparation
it
will
at
least
show
us
that
the
king
was
wrong
to
lose
his
temper
wrong
to
lose
his
temper
cried
the
king
in
a
loud
passionate
voice
did
not
my
father
my
grandfathers
too
before
me
lose
their
temper
at
times
in
heavens
name
the
king
your
father
and
the
king
your
grandfather
never
lost
their
temper
except
when
under
the
protection
of
their
own
palace
the
king
is
master
wherever
he
may
be
that
is
a
flattering
complimentary
phrase
which
cannot
proceed
from
any
one
but
m
colbert
but
it
happens
not
to
be
the
truth
the
king
is
at
home
in
every
mans
house
when
he
has
driven
its
owner
out
of
it
the
king
bit
his
lips
but
said
nothing
can
it
be
possible
said
dartagnan
here
is
a
man
who
is
positively
ruining
himself
in
order
to
please
you
and
you
wish
to
have
him
arrested
mordioux
sire
if
my
name
was
fouquet
and
people
treated
me
in
that
manner
i
would
swallow
at
a
single
gulp
all
sorts
of
fireworks
and
other
things
and
i
would
set
fire
to
them
and
send
myself
and
everybody
else
in
blownup
atoms
to
the
sky
but
it
is
all
the
same
it
is
your
wish
and
it
shall
be
done
go
said
the
king
but
have
you
men
enough
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
take
a

why
that
is
so
easy
that
a
very
child
might
do
it
it
is
like
drinking
a
glass
of
wormwood
one
makes
an
ugly
face
and
that
is
all
if
he
defends
himself
he
it
is
not
at
all
likely
defend
himself
when
such
extreme
harshness
as
you
are
going
to
practice
makes
the
man
a
very
martyr
nay
i
am
sure
that
if
he
has
a
million
of
francs
left
which
i
very
much
doubt
he
would
be
willing
enough
to
give
it
in
order
to
have
such
a
termination
as
this
but
what
does
that
matter
it
shall
be
done
at

stay
said
the
king
do
not
make
his
arrest
a
public
affair
that
will
be
more
difficult
why
so
because
nothing
is
easier
than
to
go
up
to
m
fouquet
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
enthusiastic
guests
who
surround
him
and
say
in
the
kings
name
i
arrest
you
but
to
go
up
to
him
to
turn
him
first
one
way
and
then
another
to
drive
him
up
into
one
of
the
corners
of
the
chessboard
in
such
a
way
that
he
cannot
escape
to
take
him
away
from
his
guests
and
keep
him
a
prisoner
for
you
without
one
of
them
alas
having
heard
anything
about
it
that
indeed
is
a
genuine
difficulty
the
greatest
of
all
in
truth
and
i
hardly
see
how
it
is
to
be
done
you
had
better
say
it
is
impossible
and
you
will
have
finished
much
sooner
heaven
help
me
but
i
seem
to
be
surrounded
by
people
who
prevent
me
doing
what
i
wish
i
do
not
prevent
your
doing
anything
have
you
indeed
decided
take
care
of
m

i
shall
have
made
up
my
mind
by
tomorrow
morning

shall
be
done

and
return
when
i
rise
in
the

for

orders
and
now
leave
me
to
myself
you

not

then
said
the
musketeer
firing
his
last
shot
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
the
king
started
with
his
whole
mind
fixed
on
the
thought
of
revenge
he
had
forgotten
the
cause
and
substance
of
the
offense
no
no
one
he
said
no
one
here
leave
me
dartagnan
quitted
the
room
the
king
closed
the
door
with
his
own
hands
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
his
apartment
at
a
furious
pace
like
a
wounded
bull
in
an
arena
trailing
from
his
horn
the
colored
streamers
and
the
iron
darts
at
last
he
began
to
take
comfort
in
the
expression
of
his
violent
feelings
miserable
wretch
that
he
is
not
only
does
he
squander
my
finances
but
with
his
illgotten
plunder
he
corrupts
secretaries
friends
generals
artists
and
all
and
tries
to
rob
me
of
the
one
to
whom
i
am
most
attached
this
is
the
reason
that
perfidious
girl
so
boldly
took
his
part
gratitude
and
who
can
tell
whether
it
was
not
a
stronger
feelinglove
itself
he
gave
himself
up
for
a
moment
to
the
bitterest
reflections
a
satyr
he
thought
with
that
abhorrent
hate
with
which
young
men
regard
those
more
advanced
in
life
who
still
think
of
love
a
man
who
has
never
found
opposition
or
resistance
in
any
one
who
lavishes
his
gold
and
jewels
in
every
direction
and
who
retains
his
staff
of
painters
in
order
to
take
the
portraits
of
his
mistresses
in
the
costume
of
goddesses
the
king
trembled
with
passion
as
he
continued
he
pollutes
and
profanes
everything
that
belongs
to
me
he
destroys
everything
that
is
mine
he
will
be
my
death
at
last
i
know
that
man
is
too
much
for
me
he
is
my
mortal
enemy
but
he
shall
forthwith
fall
i
hate
himi
hate
himi
hate
him
and
as
he
pronounced
these
words
he
struck
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
which
he
was
sitting
violently
over
and
over
again
and
then
rose
like
one
in
an
epileptic
fit
tomorrow
tomorrow
oh
happy
day
he
murmured
when
the
sun
rises
no
other
rival
shall
that
brilliant
king
of
space
possess
but
me
that
man
shall
fall
so
low
that
when
people
look
at
the
abject
ruin
my
anger
shall
have
wrought
they
will
be
forced
to
confess
at
last
and
at
least
that
i
am
indeed
greater
than
he
the
king
who
was
incapable
of
mastering
his
emotions
any
longer
knocked
over
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
a
small
table
placed
close
to
his
bedside
and
in
the
very
bitterness
of
anger
almost
weeping
and
halfsuffocated
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
dressed
as
he
was
and
bit
the
sheets
in
his
extremity
of
passion
trying
to
find
repose
of
body
at
least
there
the
bed
creaked
beneath
his
weight
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
broken
sounds
emerging
or
one
might
say
exploding
from
his
overburdened

from

subsided
into

from

had
thrown
himself
for
a

minutes
to

fro
convulsively
on
his
bed
his
nerveless
arms
fell
quietly
down
his
head
lay
languidly
on
his
pillow
his
limbs
exhausted
with
excessive
emotion
still
trembled
occasionally
agitated
by
muscular
contractions
while
from
his
breast
faint
and
infrequent
sighs
still
issued
morpheus
the
tutelary
deity
of
the
apartment
towards
whom
louis
raised
his
eyes
wearied
by
his
anger
and
reconciled
by
his
tears
showered
down
upon
him
the
sleepinducing
poppies
with
which
his
hands
are
ever
filled
so
presently
the
monarch
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
then
it
seemed
to
him
as
it
often
happens
in
that
first
sleep
so
light
and
gentle
which
raises
the
body
above
the
couch
and
the
soul
above
the
earthit
seemed
to
him
we
say
as
if
the
god
morpheus
painted
on
the
ceiling
looked
at
him
with
eyes
resembling
human
eyes
that
something
shone
brightly
and
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
dome
above
the
sleeper
that
the
crowd
of
terrible
dreams
which
thronged
together
in
his
brain
and
which
were
interrupted
for
a
moment
half
revealed
a
human
face
with
a
hand
resting
against
the
mouth
and
in
an
attitude
of
deep
and
absorbed
meditation
and
strange
enough
too
this
man
bore
so
wonderful
a
resemblance
to
the
king
himself
that
louis
fancied
he
was
looking
at
his
own
face
reflected
in
a
mirror
with
the
exception
however
that
the
face
was
saddened
by
a
feeling
of
the
profoundest
pity
then
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
dome
gradually
retired
escaping
from
his
gaze
and
that
the
figures
and
attributes
painted
by
lebrun
became
darker
and
darker
as
the
distance
became
more
and
more
remote
a
gentle
easy
movement
as
regular
as
that
by
which
a
vessel
plunges
beneath
the
waves
had
succeeded
to
the
immovableness
of
the
bed
doubtless
the
king
was
dreaming
and
in
this
dream
the
crown
of
gold
which
fastened
the
curtains
together
seemed
to
recede
from
his
vision
just
as
the
dome
to
which
it
remained
suspended
had
done
so
that
the
winged
genius
which
with
both
its
hand
supported
the
crown
seemed
though
vainly
so
to
call
upon
the
king
who
was
fast
disappearing
from
it
the
bed
still
sunk
louis
with
his
eyes
open
could
not
resist
the
deception
of
this
cruel
hallucination
at
last
as
the
light
of
the
royal
chamber
faded
away
into
darkness
and
gloom
something
cold
gloomy
and
inexplicable
in
its
nature
seemed
to
infect
the
air
no
paintings
nor
gold
nor
velvet
hangings
were
visible
any
longer
nothing
but
walls
of
a
dull
gray
color
which
the
increasing
gloom
made
darker
every
moment
and
yet
the
bed
still
continued
to
descend
and
after
a
minute
which
seemed
in
its
duration
almost
an
age
to
the
king
it
reached
a
stratum
of
air
black
and
chill
as
death
and
then
it
stopped
the
king
could
no
longer
see
the
light
in
his
room
except
as
from
the
bottom
of
a
well
we
can
see
the
light
of
day
i
am
under
the
influence
of
some
atrocious
dream
he
thought
it
is
time
to
awaken
from
it
come
let
me
wake
every
one
has
experienced
the
sensation
the
above
remark
conveys
there
is
hardly
a
person
who
in
the
midst
of
a
nightmare
whose
influence
is
suffocating
has
not
said
to
himself
by
the
help
of
that
light
which
still
burns
in
the
brain
when
every
human
light
is
extinguished
it
is
nothing
but
a
dream
after
all
this
was
precisely
what
louis
xiv
said
to
himself
but
when
he
said
come
come
wake
up
he
perceived
that
not
only
was
he
already
awake
but
still
more
that
he
had
his
eyes
open
also
and
then
he
looked
all
round
him
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
two
armed
men
stood
in
stolid
silence
each
wrapped
in
a
huge
cloak
and
the
face
covered
with
a
mask
one
of
them
held
a
small
lamp
in
his
hand
whose
glimmering
light
revealed
the
saddest
picture
a
king
could
look
upon
louis
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
that
his
dream
still
lasted
and
that
all
he
had
to
do
to
cause
it
to
disappear
was
to
move
his
arms
or
to
say
something
aloud
he
darted
from
his
bed
and
found
himself
upon
the
damp
moist
ground
then
addressing
himself
to
the
man
who
held
the
lamp
in
his
hand
he
said
what
is
this
monsieur
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
jest
it
is
no
jest
replied
in
a
deep
voice
the
masked
figure
that
held
the
lantern
do
you
belong
to
m
fouquet
inquired
the
king
greatly
astonished
at
his
situation
it
matters
very
little
to
whom
we
belong
said
the
phantom
we
are
your
masters
now
that
is
sufficient
the
king
more
impatient
than
intimidated
turned
to
the
other
masked
figure
if
this
is
a
comedy
he
said
you
will
tell
m
fouquet
that
i
find
it
unseemly
and
improper
and
that
i
command
it
should
cease
the
second
masked
person
to
whom
the
king
had
addressed
himself
was
a
man
of
huge
stature
and
vast
circumference
he
held
himself
erect
and
motionless
as
any
block
of
marble
well
added
the
king
stamping
his
foot
you
do
not
answer
we
do
not
answer
you
my
good
monsieur
said
the
giant
in
a
stentorian
voice
because
there
is
nothing
to
say
at
least
tell
me
what
you
want
exclaimed
louis
folding
his
arms
with
a
passionate
gesture
you
will
know
by
and
by
replied
the
man
who
held
the
lamp
in
the
meantime
tell
me
where
i
am
look
louis
looked
all
round
him
but
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
which
the
masked
figure
raised
for
the
purpose
he
could
perceive
nothing
but
the
damp
walls
which
glistened
here
and
there
with
the
slimy
traces
of
the
snail
ohoha
dungeon
cried
the
king
no
a
subterranean
passage
which
leads
will
you
be
good
enough
to
follow
us
i
shall
not
stir
from
hence
cried
the
king
if
you
are
obstinate
my
dear
young
friend
replied
the
taller
of
the
two
i
will
lift
you
up
in
my
arms
and
roll
you
up
in
your
own
cloak
and
if
you
should
happen
to
be
stifled
whyso
much
the
worse
for
you
as
he
said
this
he
disengaged
from
beneath
his
cloak
a
hand
of
which
milo
of
crotona
would
have
envied
him
the
possession
on
the
day
when
he
had
that
unhappy
idea
of
rending
his
last
oak
the
king
dreaded
violence
for
he
could
well
believe
that
the
two
men
into
whose
power
he
had
fallen
had
not
gone
so
far
with
any
idea
of
drawing
back
and
that
they
would
consequently
be
ready
to
proceed
to
extremities
if
necessary
he
shook
his
head
and
said
it
seems
i
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
couple
of
assassins
move
on
then
neither
of
the
men
answered
a
word
to
this
remark
the
one
who
carried
the
lantern
walked
first
the
king
followed
him
while
the
second
masked
figure
closed
the
procession
in
this
manner
they
passed
along
a
winding
gallery
of
some
length
with
as
many
staircases
leading
out
of
it
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
mysterious
and
gloomy
palaces
of
ann
radcliffes
creation
all
these
windings
and
turnings
during
which
the
king
heard
the
sound
of
running
water
over
his
head
ended
at
last
in
a
long
corridor
closed
by
an
iron
door
the
figure
with
the
lamp
opened
the
door
with
one
of
the
keys
he
wore
suspended
at
his
girdle
where
during
the
whole
of
the
brief
journey
the
king
had
heard
them
rattle
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
and
admitted
the
air
louis
recognized
the
balmy
odors
that
trees
exhale
in
hot
summer
nights
he
paused
hesitatingly
for
a
moment
or
two
but
the
huge
sentinel
who
followed
him
thrust
him
out
of
the
subterranean
passage
another
blow
said
the
king
turning
towards
the
one
who
had
just
had
the
audacity
to
touch
his
sovereign
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
the
king
of
france
try
to
forget
that
word
replied
the
man
with
the
lamp
in
a
tone
which
as
little
admitted
of
a
reply
as
one
of
the
famous
decrees
of
minos
you
deserve
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
for
the
words
that
you
have
just
made
use
of
said
the
giant
as
he
extinguished
the
lamp
his
companion
handed
to
him
but
the
king
is
too
kindhearted
louis
at
that
threat
made
so
sudden
a
movement
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
meditated
flight
but
the
giants
hand
was
in
a
moment
placed
on
his
shoulder
and
fixed
him
motionless
where
he
stood
but
tell
me
at
least
where
we
are
going
said
the
king
come
replied
the
former
of
the
two
men
with
a
kind
of
respect
in
his
manner
and
leading
his
prisoner
towards
a
carriage
which
seemed
to
be
in
waiting
the
carriage
was
completely
concealed
amid
the
trees
two
horses
with
their
feet
fettered
were
fastened
by
a
halter
to
the
lower
branches
of
a
large
oak
get
in
said
the
same
man
opening
the
carriagedoor
and
letting
down
the
step
the
king
obeyed
seated
himself
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
the
padded
door
of
which
was
shut
and
locked
immediately
upon
him
and
his
guide
as
for
the
giant
he
cut
the
fastenings
by
which
the
horses
were
bound
harnessed
them
himself
and
mounted
on
the
box
of
the
carriage
which
was
unoccupied
the
carriage
set
off
immediately
at
a
quick
trot
turned
into
the
road
to
paris
and
in
the
forest
of
senart
found
a
relay
of
horses
fastened
to
the
trees
in
the
same
manner
the
first
horses
had
been
and
without
a
postilion
the
man
on
the
box
changed
the
horses
and
continued
to
follow
the
road
towards
paris
with
the
same
rapidity
so
that
they
entered
the
city
about
three
oclock
in
the
morning
they
carriage
proceeded
along
the
faubourg
saintantoine
and
after
having
called
out
to
the
sentinel
by
the
kings
order
the
driver
conducted
the
horses
into
the
circular
inclosure
of
the
bastile
looking
out
upon
the
courtyard
called
la
cour
du
gouvernement
there
the
horses
drew
up
reeking
with
sweat
at
the
flight
of
steps
and
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
ran
forward
go
and
wake
the
governor
said
the
coachman
in
a
voice
of
thunder
with
the
exception
of
this
voice
which
might
have
been
heard
at
the
entrance
of
the
faubourg
saintantoine
everything
remained
as
calm
in
the
carriage
as
in
the
prison
ten
minutes
afterwards
m
de
baisemeaux
appeared
in
his
dressinggown
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
what
is
the
matter
now
he
asked
and
whom
have
you
brought
me
there
the
man
with
the
lantern
opened
the
carriagedoor
and
said
two
or
three
words
to
the
one
who
acted
as
driver
who
immediately
got
down
from
his
seat
took
up
a
short
musket
which
he
kept
under
his
feet
and
placed
its
muzzle
on
his
prisoners
chest
and
fire
at
once
if
he
speaks
added
aloud
the
man
who
alighted
from
the
carriage
very
good
replied
his
companion
without
another
remark
with
this
recommendation
the
person
who
had
accompanied
the
king
in
the
carriage
ascended
the
flight
of
steps
at
the
top
of
which
the
governor
was
awaiting
him
monsieur
dherblay
said
the
latter
hush
said
aramis
let
us
go
into
your
room
good
heavens
what
brings
you
here
at
this
hour
a
mistake
my
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
aramis
replied
quietly
it
appears
that
you
were
quite
right
the
other
day
what
about
inquired
the
governor
about
the
order
of
release
my
dear
friend
tell
me
what
you
mean
monsieurno
monseigneur
said
the
governor
almost
suffocated
by
surprise
and
terror
it
is
a
very
simple
affair
you
remember
dear
m
de
baisemeaux
that
an
order
of
release
was
sent
to
you
yes
for
marchiali
very
good
we
both
thought
that
it
was
for
marchiali
certainly
you
will
recollect
however
that
i
would
not
credit
it
but
that
you
compelled
me
to
believe
it
oh
baisemeaux
my
good
fellow
what
a
word
to
make
use
ofstrongly
recommended
that
was
all
strongly
recommended
yes
strongly
recommended
to
give
him
up
to
you
and
that
you
carried
him
off
with
you
in
your
carriage
well
my
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
it
was
a
mistake
it
was
discovered
at
the
ministry
so
that
i
now
bring
you
an
order
from
the
king
to
set
at
liberty
seldonthat
poor
seldon
fellow
you
know
seldon
are
you
sure
this
time
well
read
it
yourself
added
aramis
handing
him
the
order
why
said
baisemeaux
this
order
is
the
very
same
that
has
already
passed
through
my
hands
indeed
it
is
the
very
one
i
assured
you
i
saw
the
other
evening
parbleu
i
recognize
it
by
the
blot
of
ink
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
that
but
all
i
know
is
that
i
bring
it
for
you
but
then
what
about
the
other
what
other
marchiali
i
have
got
him
here
with
me
but
that
is
not
enough
for
me
i
require
a
new
order
to
take
him
back
again
dont
talk
such
nonsense
my
dear
baisemeaux
you
talk
like
a
child
where
is
the
order
you
received
respecting
marchiali
baisemeaux
ran
to
his
iron
chest
and
took
it
out
aramis
seized
hold
of
it
coolly
tore
it
in
four
pieces
held
them
to
the
lamp
and
burnt
them
good
heavens
what
are
you
doing
exclaimed
baisemeaux
in
an
extremity
of
terror
look
at
your
position
quietly
my
good
governor
said
aramis
with
imperturbable
selfpossession
and
you
will
see
how
very
simple
the
whole
affair
is
you
no
longer
possess
any
order
justifying
marchialis
release
i
am
a
lost
man
far
from
it
my
good
fellow
since
i
have
brought
marchiali
back
to
you
and
all
accordingly
is
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
never
left
ah
said
the
governor
completely
overcome
by
terror
plain
enough
you
see
and
you
will
go
and
shut
him
up
immediately
i
should
think
so
indeed
and
you
will
hand
over
this
seldon
to
me
whose
liberation
is
authorized
by
this
order
do
you
understand
ii
you
do
understand
i
see
said
aramis
very
good
baisemeaux
clapped
his
hands
together
but
why
at
all
events
after
having
taken
marchiali
away
from
me
do
you
bring
him
back
again
cried
the
unhappy
governor
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
and
completely
dumbfounded
for
a
friend
such
as
you
are
said
aramisfor
so
devoted
a
servant
i
have
no
secrets
and
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
baisemeauxs
ear
as
he
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
you
know
the
resemblance
between
that
unfortunate
fellow
and
and
the
kingyes
very
good
the
first
use
that
marchiali
made
of
his
liberty
was
to
persistcan
you
guess
what
how
is
it
likely
i
should
guess
to
persist
in
saying
that
he
was
king
of
france
to
dress
himself
up
in
clothes
like
those
of
the
king
and
then
pretend
to
assume
that
he
was
the
king
himself
gracious
heavens
that
is
the
reason
why
i
have
brought
him
back
again
my
dear
friend
he
is
mad
and
lets
every
one
see
how
mad
he
is
what
is
to
be
done
then
that
is
very
simple
let
no
one
hold
any
communication
with
him
you
understand
that
when
his
peculiar
style
of
madness
came
to
the
kings
ears
the
king
who
had
pitied
his
terrible
affliction
and
saw
that
all
his
kindness
had
been
repaid
by
black
ingratitude
became
perfectly
furious
so
that
nowand
remember
this
very
distinctly
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
for
it
concerns
you
most
closelyso
that
there
is
now
i
repeat
sentence
of
death
pronounced
against
all
those
who
may
allow
him
to
communicate
with
any
one
else
but
me
or
the
king
himself
you
understand
baisemeaux
sentence
of
death
you
need
not
ask
me
whether
i
understand
and
now
let
us
go
down
and
conduct
this
poor
devil
back
to
his
dungeon
again
unless
you
prefer
he
should
come
up
here
what
would
be
the
good
of
that
it
would
be
better
perhaps
to
enter
his
name
in
the
prisonbook
at
once
of
course
certainly
not
a
doubt
of
it
in
that
case
have
him
up
baisemeaux
ordered
the
drums
to
be
beaten
and
the
bell
to
be
rung
as
a
warning
to
every
one
to
retire
in
order
to
avoid
meeting
a
prisoner
about
whom
it
was
desired
to
observe
a
certain
mystery
then
when
the
passages
were
free
he
went
to
take
the
prisoner
from
the
carriage
at
whose
breast
porthos
faithful
to
the
directions
which
had
been
given
him
still
kept
his
musket
leveled
ah
is
that
you
miserable
wretch
cried
the
governor
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
king
very
good
very
good
and
immediately
making
the
king
get
out
of
the
carriage
he
led
him
still
accompanied
by
porthos
who
had
not
taken
off
his
mask
and
aramis
who
again
resumed
his
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
bertaudiere
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
philippe
for
six
long
years
had
bemoaned
his
existence
the
king
entered
the
cell
without
pronouncing
a
single
word
he
faltered
in
as
limp
and
haggard
as
a
rainstruck
lily
baisemeaux
shut
the
door
upon
him
turned
the
key
twice
in
the
lock
and
then
returned
to
aramis
it
is
quite
true
he
said
in
a
low
tone
that
he
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
king
but
less
so
than
you
said
so
that
said
aramis
you
would
not
have
been
deceived
by
the
substitution
of
the
one
for
the
other
what
a
question
you
are
a
most
valuable
fellow
baisemeaux
said
aramis
and
now
set
seldon
free
oh
yes
i
was
going
to
forget
that
i
will
go
and
give
orders
at
once
bah
tomorrow
will
be
time
enough
tomorrowoh
no
this

my

again
to

and
as
fast
as
possible
a
man
is
light
and
easy
enough
when
he
has
faithfully
served
his

him

a

at
the
bastile
pain
anguish
and
suffering
in
human
life
are
always
in
proportion
to
the
strength
with
which
a
man
is
endowed
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
heaven
always
apportions
to
a
mans
capability
of
endurance
the
anguish
with
which
he
afflicts
him
for
that
indeed
would
not
be
true
since
heaven
permits
the
existence
of
death
which
is
sometimes
the
only
refuge
open
to
those
who
are
too
closely
pressedtoo
bitterly
afflicted
as
far
as
the
body
is
concerned
suffering
is
in
proportion
to
the
strength
which
has
been
accorded
in
other
words
the
weak
suffer
more
where
the
trial
is
the
same
than
the

and
what
are
the
elementary
principles
we
may
ask
that

it
notmore

anything

we
shall
not
even

the
trouble
to
demonstrate
this
for
it
is
an
axiom
in
morals
as
in
physics
when
the
young
king
stupefied
and
crushed
in
every
sense
and
feeling
found
himself
led
to
a
cell
in
the
bastile
he
fancied
death
itself
is
but
a
sleep
that
it
too
has
its
dreams
as
well
that
the
bed
had
broken
through
the
flooring
of
his
room
at
vaux
that
death
had
resulted
from
the
occurrence
and
that
still
carrying
out
his
dream
the
king
louis
xiv
now
no
longer
living
was
dreaming
one
of
those
horrors
impossible
to
realize
in
life
which
is
termed
dethronement
imprisonment
and
insult
towards
a
sovereign
who
formerly
wielded
unlimited
power
to
be
present
atan
actual
witness
tooof
this
bitterness
of
death
to
float
indecisively
in
an
incomprehensible
mystery
between
resemblance
and
reality
to
hear
everything
to
see
everything
without
interfering
in
a
single
detail
of
agonizing
suffering
wasso
the
king
thought
within
himselfa
torture
far
more
terrible
since
it
might
last
forever
is
this
what
is
termed
eternityhell
he
murmured
at
the
moment
the
door
was
closed
upon
him
which
we
remember
baisemeaux
had
shut
with
his
own
hands
he
did
not
even
look
round
him
and
in
the
room
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
wall
he
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
the
terrible
supposition
that
he
was
already
dead
as
he
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
avoid
looking
upon
something
even
worse
still
how
can
i
have
died
he
said
to
himself
sick
with
terror
the
bed
might
have
been
let
down
by
some
artificial
means
but
no
i
do
not
remember
to
have
felt
a
bruise
nor
any
shock
either
would
they
not
rather
have
poisoned
me
at
my
meals
or
with
the
fumes
of
wax
as
they
did
my
ancestress
jeanne
dalbret
suddenly
the
chill
of
the
dungeons
seemed
to
fall
like
a
wet
cloak
upon
louiss
shoulders
i
have
seen
he
said
my
father
lying
dead
upon
his
funeral
couch
in
his
regal
robes
that
pale
face
so
calm
and
worn
those
hands
once
so
skillful
lying
nerveless
by
his
side
those
limbs
stiffened
by
the
icy
grasp
of
death
nothing
there
betokened
a
sleep
that
was
disturbed
by
dreams
and
yet
how
numerous
were
the
dreams
which
heaven
might
have
sent
that
royal
corpsehim
whom
so
many
others
had
preceded
hurried
away
by
him
into
eternal
death
no
that
king
was
still
the
king
he
was
enthroned
still
upon
that
funeral
couch
as
upon
a
velvet
armchair
he
had
not
abdicated
one
title
of
his
majesty
god
who
had
not
punished
him
cannot
will
not
punish
me
who
have
done
nothing
a
strange
sound
attracted
the
young
mans
attention
he
looked
round
him
and
saw
on
the
mantelshelf
just
below
an
enormous
crucifix
coarsely
painted
in
fresco
on
the
wall
a
rat
of
enormous
size
engaged
in
nibbling
a
piece
of
dry
bread
but
fixing
all
the
time
an
intelligent
and
inquiring
look
upon
the
new
occupant
of
the
cell
the
king
could
not
resist
a
sudden
impulse
of
fear
and
disgust
he
moved
back
towards
the
door
uttering
a
loud
cry
and
as
if
he
but
needed
this
cry
which
escaped
from
his
breast
almost
unconsciously
to
recognize
himself
louis

that
he
was
alive
and
in
full
possession
of
his
natural
senses

cried

looked
round
him
for
a
bell
to
summon
some
one
to
him
there
are
no
bells
in
the

he
said
and
it

in
what

yet
who

the

relapsing
into
gloom
again
perhaps
my
brother
the
duc
dorleans
is
doing
that
which
my
uncle
wished
to
do
during
the
whole
of
his
life

and
at
this
idea
of
separation
the
poor
lover
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
sobs
and
groans
there
is
a
governor
in
this
place
the
king
continued
in
a
fury
of
passion
i

speak
to
him
i
will
summon
him
to

he
calledno
voice
replied
to
his
he
seized
hold
of
his
chair
and
hurled
it
against
the
massive
oaken
door
the
wood
resounded
against
the
door
and
awakened
many
a
mournful
echo
in
the
profound
depths
of
the
staircase
but
from
a
human
creature
none
this
was
a
fresh
proof
for
the
king
of
the
slight
regard
in
which
he
was
held
at
the
bastile
therefore
when
his
first
fit
of
anger
had
passed
away
having
remarked
a
barred
window
through
which
there
passed
a
stream
of
light
lozengeshaped
which
must
be
he
knew
the
bright
orb
of
approaching
day
louis
began
to
call
out
at
first
gently
enough
then
louder
and
louder
still
but
no
one
replied
twenty
other
attempts
which
he
made
one
after
another
obtained
no
other
or
better
success
his
blood
began
to
boil
within
him
and
mount
to
his
head
his
nature
was
such
that
accustomed
to
command
he
trembled
at
the
idea
of
disobedience
the
prisoner
broke
the
chair
which
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
lift
and
made
use
of
it
as
a
battering
ram
to
strike
against
the
door
he
struck
so
loudly
and
so
repeatedly
that
the
perspiration
soon
began
to
pour
down
his
face
the
sound
became
tremendous
and
continuous
certain
stifled
smothered
cries
replied
in
different
directions
this
sound
produced
a
strange
effect
upon
the
king
he
paused
to
listen
it
was
the
voice
of
the
prisoners
formerly
his
victims
now
his
companions
the
voices
ascended
like
vapors
through
the
thick
ceilings
and
the
massive
walls
and
rose
in
accusations
against
the
author
of
this
noise
as
doubtless
their
sighs
and
tears
accused
in
whispered
tones
the
author
of
their
captivity
after
having
deprived
so
many
people
of
their
liberty
the
king
came
among
them
to
rob
them
of
their
rest
this
idea
almost
drove
him
mad
it
redoubled
his
strength
or
rather
his
will
bent
upon
obtaining
some
information
or
a
conclusion
to
the
affair
with
a
portion
of
the
broken
chair
he
recommenced
the
noise
at
the
end
of
an
hour
louis
heard
something
in
the
corridor
behind
the
door
of
his
cell
and
a
violent
blow
which
was
returned
upon
the
door
itself
made
him
cease
his
own
are
you
mad
said
a
rude
brutal
voice
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
this
morning
thought
the
king
but
he
said
aloud
politely
monsieur
are
you
the
governor
of
the
bastile
my
good
fellow
your
head
is
out
of
sorts
replied
the
voice
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
make
such
a
terrible
disturbance
be
quiet
mordioux
are
you
the
governor
the
king
inquired
again
he
heard
a
door
on
the
corridor
close
the
jailer
had
just
left
not
condescending
to
reply
a
single
word
when
the
king
had
assured
himself
of
his
departure
his
fury
knew
no
longer
any
bounds
as
agile
as
a
tiger
he
leaped
from
the
table
to
the
window
and
struck
the
iron
bars
with
all
his
might
he
broke
a
pane
of
glass
the
pieces
of
which
fell
clanking
into
the
courtyard
below
he
shouted
with
increasing
hoarseness
the
governor
the
governor
this
excess
lasted
fully
an
hour
during
which
time
he
was
in
a
burning
fever
with
his
hair
in
disorder
and
matted
on
his
forehead
his
dress
torn
and
covered
with
dust
and
plaster
his
linen
in
shreds
the
king
never
rested
until
his
strength
was
utterly
exhausted
and
it
was
not
until
then
that
he
clearly
understood
the
pitiless
thickness
of
the
walls
the
impenetrable
nature
of
the
cement
invincible
to
every
influence
but
that
of
time
and
that
he
possessed
no
other
weapon
but
despair
he
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
door
and
let
the
feverish
throbbings
of
his
heart
calm
by
degrees
it
had
seemed
as
if
one
single
additional
pulsation
would
have
made
it
burst
a
moment
will
come
when
the
food
which
is
given
to
the
prisoners
will
be
brought
to
me
i
shall
then
see
some
one
i
shall
speak
to
him
and
get
an
answer
and
the
king
tried
to
remember
at
what
hour
the
first
repast
of
the
prisoners
was
served
at
the
bastile
he
was
ignorant
even
of
this
detail
the
feeling
of
remorse
at
this
remembrance
smote
him
like
the
thrust
of
a
dagger
that
he
should
have
lived
for
five
and
twenty
years
a
king
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
every
happiness
without
having
bestowed
a
moments
thought
on
the
misery
of
those
who
had
been
unjustly
deprived
of
their
liberty
the
king
blushed
for
very
shame
he
felt
that
heaven
in
permitting
this
fearful
humiliation
did
no
more
than
render
to
the
man
the
same
torture
as
had
been
inflicted
by
that
man
upon
so
many
others
nothing
could
be
more
efficacious
for
reawakening
his
mind
to
religious
influences
than
the
prostration
of
his
heart
and
mind
and
soul
beneath
the
feeling
of
such
acute
wretchedness
but
louis
dared
not
even
kneel
in
prayer
to
god
to
entreat
him
to
terminate
his
bitter
trial
heaven
is
right
he
said
heaven
acts
wisely
it
would
be
cowardly
to
pray
to
heaven
for
that
which
i
have
so
often
refused
my
own
fellowcreatures
he
had
reached
this
stage
of
his
reflections
that
is
of
his
agony
of
mind
when
a
similar
noise
was
again
heard
behind
his
door
followed
this
time
by
the
sound
of
the
key
in
the
lock
and
of
the
bolts
being
withdrawn
from
their
staples
the
king
bounded
forward
to
be
nearer
to
the
person
who
was
about
to
enter
but
suddenly
reflecting
that
it
was
a
movement
unworthy
of
a
sovereign
he
paused
assumed
a
noble
and
calm
expression
which
for
him
was
easy
enough
and
waited
with
his
back
turned
towards
the
window
in
order
to
some
extent
to
conceal
his
agitation
from
the
eyes
of
the
person
who
was
about
to
enter
it
was
only
a
jailer
with
a
basket
of
provisions
the
king
looked
at
the
man
with
restless
anxiety
and
waited
until
he
spoke
ah
said
the
latter
you
have
broken
your
chair
i
said
you
had
done
so
why
you
have
gone
quite
mad
monsieur
said
the
king
be
careful
what
you
say
it
will
be
a
very
serious
affair
for
you
the
jailer
placed
the
basket
on
the
table
and
looked
at
his
prisoner
steadily
what
do
you
say
he
said
desire
the
governor
to
come
to
me
added
the
king
in
accents
full
of
calm
and
dignity
come
my
boy
said
the
turnkey
you
have
always
been
very
quiet
and
reasonable
but
you
are
getting
vicious
it
seems
and
i
wish
you
to
know
it
in
time
you
have
broken
your
chair
and
made
a
great
disturbance
that
is
an
offense
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
one
of
the
lower
dungeons
promise
me
not
to
begin
over
again
and
i
will
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
the
governor
i
wish
to
see
the
governor
replied
the
king
still
governing
his
passions
he
will
send
you
off
to
one
of
the
dungeons
i
tell
you
so
take
care
i
insist
upon
it
do
you
hear
ah
ah
your
eyes
are
becoming
wild
again
very
good
i
shall
take
away
your
knife
and
the
jailer
did
what
he
said
quitted
the
prisoner
and
closed
the
door
leaving
the
king
more
astounded
more
wretched
more
isolated
than
ever
it
was
useless
though
he
tried
it
to
make
the
same
noise
again
on
his
door
and
equally
useless
that
he
threw
the
plates
and
dishes
out
of
the
window
not
a
single
sound
was
heard
in
recognition
two
hours
afterwards
he
could
not
be
recognized
as
a
king
a
gentleman
a
man
a
human
being
he
might
rather
be
called
a
madman
tearing
the
door
with
his
nails
trying
to
tear
up
the
flooring
of
his
cell
and
uttering
such
wild
and
fearful
cries
that
the
old
bastile
seemed
to
tremble
to
its
very
foundations
for
having
revolted
against
its
master
as
for
the
governor
the
jailer
did
not
even
think
of
disturbing
him
the
turnkeys
and
the
sentinels
had
reported
the
occurrence
to
him
but
what
was
the
good
of
it
were
not
these
madmen
common
enough
in
such
a
prison
and
were
not
the
walls
still
stronger
m
de
baisemeaux
thoroughly
impressed
with
what
aramis
had
told
him
and
in
perfect
conformity
with
the
kings
order
hoped
only
that
one
thing
might
happen
namely
that
the
madman
marchiali
might
be
mad
enough
to
hang
himself
to
the
canopy
of
his
bed
or
to
one
of
the
bars
of
the
window
in
fact
the
prisoner
was
anything
but
a
profitable
investment
for
m
baisemeaux
and
became
more
annoying
than
agreeable
to
him
these
complications
of
seldon
and
marchialithe
complications
first
of
setting
at
liberty
and
then
imprisoning
again
the
complications
arising
from
the
strong
likeness
in
questionhad
at
last
found
a
very
proper
denouement
baisemeaux
even
thought
he
had
remarked
that
dherblay
himself
was
not
altogether
dissatisfied
with
the
result
and
then
really
said
baisemeaux
to
his
next
in
command
an
ordinary
prisoner
is
already
unhappy
enough
in
being
a
prisoner
he
suffers
quite
enough
indeed
to
induce
one
to
hope
charitably
enough
that
his
death
may
not
be
far
distant
with
still
greater
reason
accordingly
when
the
prisoner
has
gone
mad
and
might
bite
and
make
a
terrible
disturbance
in
the
bastile
why
in
such
a
case
it
is
not
simply
an
act
of
mere
charity
to
wish
him
dead
it
would
be
almost
a
good
and
even
commendable
action
quietly
to
have
him
put
out
of
his
misery
and
the
goodnatured
governor
thereupon
sat
down
to
his
late
breakfast
chapter
xix
the
shadow
of
m
fouquet
dartagnan
still
confused
and
oppressed
by
the
conversation
he
had
just
had
with
the
king
could
not
resist
asking
himself
if
he
were
really
in
possession
of
his
senses
if
he
were
really
and
truly
at
vaux
if
he
dartagnan
were
really
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
and
m
fouquet
the
owner
of
the
chateau
in
which
louis
xiv
was
at
that
moment
partaking
of
his
hospitality
these
reflections
were
not
those
of
a
drunken
man
although
everything
was
in
prodigal
profusion
at
vaux
and
the
surintendants
wines
had
met
with
a
distinguished
reception
at
the
fete
the
gascon
however
was
a
man
of
calm
selfpossession
and
no
sooner
did
he
touch
his
bright
steel
blade
than
he
knew
how
to
adopt
morally
the
cold
keen
weapon
as
his
guide
of
action
well
he
said
as
he
quitted
the
royal
apartment
i
seem
now
to
be
mixed
up
historically
with
the
destinies
of
the
king
and
of
the
minister
it
will
be
written
that
m
dartagnan
a
younger
son
of
a
gascon
family
placed
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
m
nicolas
fouquet
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
of
france
my
descendants
if
i
have
any
will
flatter
themselves
with
the
distinction
which
this
arrest
will
confer
just
as
the
members
of
the
de
luynes
family
have
done
with
regard
to
the
estates
of
the
poor
marechal
dancre
but
the
thing
is
how
best
to
execute
the
kings
directions
in
a
proper
manner
any
man
would
know
how
to
say
to
m
fouquet
your
sword
monsieur
but
it
is
not
every
one
who
would
be
able
to
take
care
of
m
fouquet
without
others
knowing
anything
about
it
how
am
i
to
manage
then
so
that
m
le
surintendant
pass
from
the
height
of
favor
to
the
direst
disgrace
that
vaux
be
turned
into
a
dungeon
for
him
that
after
having
been
steeped
to
his
lips
as
it
were
in
all
the
perfumes
and
incense
of
ahasuerus
he
is
transferred
to
the
gallows
of
haman
in
other
words
of
enguerrand
de
marigny
and
at
this
reflection
dartagnans
brow
became
clouded
with
perplexity
the
musketeer
had
certain
scruples
on
the
matter
it
must
be
admitted
to
deliver
up
to
death
for
not
a
doubt
existed
that
louis
hated
fouquet
mortally
the
man
who
had
just
shown
himself
so
delightful
and
charming
a
host
in
every
way
was
a
real
insult
to
ones
conscience
it
almost
seems
said
dartagnan
to
himself
that
if
i
am
not
a
poor
mean
miserable
fellow
i
should
let
m
fouquet
know
the
opinion
the
king
has
about
him
yet
if
i
betray
my
masters
secret
i
shall
be
a
falsehearted
treacherous
knave
a
traitor
too
a
crime
provided
for
and
punishable
by
military
lawsso
much
so
indeed
that
twenty
times
in
former
days
when
wars
were
rife
i
have
seen
many
a
miserable
fellow
strung
up
to
a
tree
for
doing
in
but
a
small
degree
what
my
scruples
counsel
me
to
undertake
upon
a
great
scale
now
no
i
think
that
a
man
of
true
readiness
of
wit
ought
to
get
out
of
this
difficulty
with
more
skill
than
that
and
now
let
us
admit
that
i
do
possess
a
little
readiness
of
invention
it
is
not
at
all
certain
though
for
after
having
for
forty
years
absorbed
so
large
a
quantity
i
shall
be
lucky
if
there
were
to
be
a
pistolesworth
left
dartagnan
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
tore
at
his
mustache
in
sheer
vexation
and
added
what
can
be
the
reason
of
m
fouquets
disgrace
there
seem
to
be
three
good
ones
the
first
because
m
colbert
doesnt
like
him
the
second
because
he
wished
to
fall
in
love
with
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
lastly
because
the
king
likes
m
colbert
and
loves
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
oh
he
is
lost
but
shall
i
put
my
foot
on
his
neck
i
of
all
men
when
he
is
falling
a
prey
to
the
intrigues
of
a
pack
of
women
and
clerks
for
shame
if
he
be
dangerous
i
will
lay
him
low
enough
if
however
he
be
only
persecuted
i
will
look
on
i
have
come
to
such
a
decisive
determination
that
neither
king
nor
living
man
shall
change
my
mind
if
athos
were
here
he
would
do
as
i
have
done
therefore
instead
of
going
in
cold
blood
up
to
m
fouquet
and
arresting
him
offhand
and
shutting
him
up
altogether
i
will
try
and
conduct
myself
like
a
man
who
understands
what
good
manners
are
people
will
talk
about
it
of
course
but
they
shall
talk
well
of
it
i
am
determined
and
dartagnan
drawing
by
a
gesture
peculiar
to
himself
his
shoulderbelt
over
his
shoulder
went
straight
off
to
m
fouquet
who
after
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
guests
was
preparing
to
retire
for
the
night
and
to
sleep
tranquilly
after
the
triumphs
of
the
day
the
air
was
still
perfumed
or
infected
whichever
way
it
may
be
considered
with
the
odors
of
the
torches
and
the
fireworks
the
waxlights
were
dying
away
in
their
sockets
the
flowers
fell
unfastened
from
the
garlands
the
groups
of
dancers
and
courtiers
were
separating
in
the
salons
surrounded
by
his
friends
who
complimented
him
and
received
his
flattering
remarks
in
return
the
surintendant
halfclosed
his
wearied
eyes
he
longed
for
rest
and
quiet
he
sank
upon
the
bed
of
laurels
which
had
been
heaped
up
for
him
for
so
many
days
past
it
might
almost
have
been
said
that
he
seemed
bowed
beneath
the
weight
of
the
new
debts
which
he
had
incurred
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
greatest
possible
honor
to
this
fete
fouquet
had
just
retired
to
his
room
still
smiling
but
more
than
halfasleep
he
could
listen
to
nothing
more
he
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
open
his
bed
seemed
to
possess
a
fascinating
and
irresistible
attraction
for
him
the
god
morpheus
the
presiding
deity
of
the
dome
painted
by
lebrun
had
extended
his
influence
over
the
adjoining
rooms
and
showered
down
his
most
sleepinducing
poppies
upon
the
master
of
the
house
fouquet
almost
entirely
alone
was
being
assisted
by
his
valet
de
chambre
to
undress
when
m
dartagnan
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
room
dartagnan
had
never
been
able
to
succeed
in
making
himself
common
at
the
court
and
notwithstanding
he
was
seen
everywhere
and
on
all
occasions
he
never
failed
to
produce
an
effect
wherever
and
whenever
he
made
his
appearance
such
is
the
happy
privilege
of
certain
natures
which
in
that
respect
resemble
either
thunder
or
lightning
every
one
recognizes
them
but
their
appearance
never
fails
to
arouse
surprise
and
astonishment
and
whenever
they
occur
the
impression
is
always
left
that
the
last
was
the
most
conspicuous
or
most
important
what
m
dartagnan
said
fouquet
who
had
already
taken
his
right
arm
out
of
the
sleeve
of
his
doublet
at
your
service
replied
the
musketeer
come
in
my
dear
m
dartagnan
thank
you
have
you
come
to
criticise
the
fete
you
are
ingenious
enough
in
your
criticisms
i
know
by
no
means
are
not
your
men
looked
after
properly
in
every
way
you
are
not
comfortably
lodged
perhaps
nothing
could
be
better
in
that
case
i
have
to
thank
you
for
being
so
amiably
disposed
and
i
must
not
fail
to
express
my
obligations
to
you
for
all
your
flattering
kindness
these
words
were
as
much
as
to
say
my
dear
dartagnan
pray
go
to
bed
since
you
have
a
bed
to
lie
down
on
and
let
me
do
the
same
dartagnan
did
not
seem
to
understand
it
are
you
going
to
bed
already
he
said
to
the
superintendent
yes
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
nothing
monsieur
nothing
at
all
you
sleep
in
this
room
then
yes
as
you
see
you
have
given
a
most
charming
fete
to
the
king
do
you
think
so
oh
beautiful
is
the
king
pleased
enchanted
did
he
desire
you
to
say
as
much
to
me
he
would
not
choose
so
unworthy
a
messenger
monseigneur
you
do
not
do
yourself
justice
monsieur
dartagnan
is
that
your
bed
there
yes
but
why
do
you
ask
are
you
not
satisfied
with
your
own
my
i
speak
frankly
to
you
most
assuredly
well
then
i
am
not
fouquet
started
and
then
replied
will
you
take
my
room
monsieur
dartagnan
what
deprive
you
of
it
monseigneur
never
what
am
i
to
do
then
allow
me
to
share
yours
with
you
fouquet
looked
at
the
musketeer
fixedly
ah
ah
he
said
you
have
just
left
the
king
i
have
monseigneur
and
the
king
wishes
you
to
pass
the
night
in
my
room
monseigneur
very
well
monsieur
dartagnan
very
well
you
are
the
master
here
i
assure
you
monseigneur
that
i
do
not
wish
to
abuse
fouquet
turned
to
his
valet
and
said
leave
us
when
the
man
had
left
he
said
to
dartagnan
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
i
a
man
of
your
superior
intelligence
cannot
have
come
to
talk
with
a
man
like
myself
at
such
an
hour
as
the
present
without
grave
motives
do
not
interrogate
me
on
the
contrary
what
do
you
want
with
me
nothing
more
than
the
pleasure
of
your
society
come
into
the
garden
then
said
the
superintendent
suddenly
or
into
the
park
no
replied
the
musketeer
hastily
no
why
the
fresh
air
come
admit
at
once
that
you
arrest
me
said
the
superintendent
to
the
captain
never
said
the
latter
you
intend
to
look
after
me
then
yes
monseigneur
i
do
upon
my
honor
upon
your
honorah
that
is
quite
another
thing
so
i
am
to
be
arrested
in
my
own
house
do
not
say
such
a
thing
on
the
contrary
i
will
proclaim
it
aloud
if
you
do
so
i
shall
be
compelled
to
request
you
to
be
silent
very
good
violence
towards
me
and
in
my
own
house
too
we
do
not
seem
to
understand
one
another
at
all
stay
a
moment
there
is
a
chessboard
there
we
will
have
a
game
if
you
have
no
objections
monsieur
dartagnan
i
am
in
disgrace
then
not
at
all
but
i
am
prohibited
i
suppose
from
withdrawing
from
your
sight
i
do
not
understand
a
word
you
are
saying
monseigneur
and
if
you
wish
me
to
withdraw
tell
me
so
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
your
mode
of
action
is
enough
to
drive
me
mad
i
was
almost
sinking
for
want
of
sleep
but
you
have
completely
awakened
me
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
i
am
sure
and
if
you
wish
to
reconcile
me
with
myself
why
go
to
sleep
in
your
bed
in
my
presence
and
i
shall
be
delighted
i
am
under
surveillance
i
see
i
will
leave
the
room
if
you
say
any
such
thing
you
are
beyond
my
comprehension
good
night
monseigneur
said
dartagnan
as
he
pretended
to
withdraw
fouquet
ran
after
him
i
will
not
lie
down
he
said
seriously
and
since
you
refuse
to
treat
me
as
a
man
and
since
you
finesse
with
me
i
will
try
and
set
you
at
bay
as
a
hunter
does
a
wild
boar
bah
cried
dartagnan
pretending
to
smile
i
shall
order
my
horses
and
set
off
for
paris
said
fouquet
sounding
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
if
that
be
the
case
monseigneur
it
is
very
difficult
you
will
arrest
me
then
no
but
i
shall
go
along
with
you
that
is
quite
sufficient
monsieur
dartagnan
returned
fouquet
coldly
it
was
not
for
nothing
you
acquired
your
reputation
as
a
man
of
intelligence
and
resource
but
with
me
all
this
is
quite
superfluous
let
us
come
to
the
point
do
me
a
service
why
do
you
arrest
me
what
have
i
done
oh
i
know
nothing
about
what
you
may
have
done
but
i
do
not
arrest
youthis
evening
at
least
this
evening
said
fouquet
turning
pale
but
tomorrow
it
is
not
tomorrow
just
yet
monseigneur
who
can
ever
answer
for
the
morrow
quick
quick
captain
let
me
speak
to
m
dherblay
alas
that
is
quite
impossible
monseigneur
i
have
strict
orders
to
see
that
you
hold
no
communication
with
any
one
with
m
dherblay
captainwith
your
friend
monseigneur
is
m
dherblay
the
only
person
with
whom
you
ought
to
be
prevented
holding
any
communication
fouquet
colored
and
then
assuming
an
air
of
resignation
he
said
you
are
right
monsieur
you
have
taught
me
a
lesson
i
ought
not
to
have
evoked
a
fallen
man
cannot
assert
his
right
to
anything
even
from
those
whose
fortunes
he
may
have
made
for
a
still
stronger
reason
he
cannot
claim
anything
from
those
to
whom
he
may
never
have
had
the
happiness
of
doing
a
service
monseigneur
it
is
perfectly
true
monsieur
dartagnan
you
have
always
acted
in
the
most
admirable
manner
towards
mein
such
a
manner
indeed
as
most
becomes
the
man
who
is
destined
to
arrest
me
you
at
least
have
never
asked
me
anything
monsieur
replied
the
gascon
touched
by
his
eloquent
and
noble
tone
of
grief
will
youi
ask
it
as
a
favorpledge
me
your
word
as
a
man
of
honor
that
you
will
not
leave
this
room
what
is
the
use
of
it
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
since
you
keep
watch
and
ward
over
me
do
you
suppose
i
should
contend
against
the
most
valiant
sword
in
the
kingdom
it
is
not
that
at
all
monseigneur
but
that
i
am
going
to
look
for
m
dherblay
and
consequently
to
leave
you
alone
fouquet
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
and
surprise
to
look
for
m
dherblay
to
leave
me
alone
he
exclaimed
clasping
his
hands
together
which
is
m
dherblays
room
the
blue
room
is
it
not
yes
my
friend
yes
your
friend
thank
you
for
that
word
monseigneur
you
confer
it
upon
me
today
at
least
if
you
have
never
done
so
before
ah
you
have
saved
me
it
will
take
a
good
ten
minutes
to
go
from
hence
to
the
blue
room
and
to
return
said
dartagnan
nearly
so
and
then
to
wake
aramis
who
sleeps
very
soundly
when
he
is
asleep
i
put
that
down
at
another
five
minutes
making
a
total
of
fifteen
minutes
absence
and
now
monseigneur
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
not
in
any
way
attempt
to
make
your
escape
and
that
when
i
return
i
shall
find
you
here
again
i
give
it
monsieur
replied
fouquet
with
an
expression
of
the
warmest
and
deepest
gratitude
dartagnan
disappeared
fouquet
looked
at
him
as
he
quitted
the
room
waited
with
a
feverish
impatience
until
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
and
as
soon
as
it
was
shut
flew
to
his
keys
opened
two
or
three
secret
doors
concealed
in
various
articles
of
furniture
in
the
room
looked
vainly
for
certain
papers
which
doubtless
he
had
left
at
saintmande
and
which
he
seemed
to
regret
not
having
found
in
them
then
hurriedly
seizing
hold
of
letters
contracts
papers
writings
he
heaped
them
up
into
a
pile
which
he
burnt
in
the
extremest
haste
upon
the
marble
hearth
of
the
fireplace
not
even
taking
time
to
draw
from
the
interior
of
it
the
vases
and
pots
of
flowers
with
which
it
was
filled
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
like
a
man
who
has
just
escaped
an
imminent
danger
and
whose
strength
abandons
him
as
soon
as
the
danger
is
past
he
sank
down
completely
overcome
on
a
couch
when
dartagnan
returned
he
found
fouquet
in
the
same
position
the
worthy
musketeer
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
fouquet
having
given
his
word
would
not
even
think
of
failing
to
keep
it
but
he
had
thought
it
most
likely
that
fouquet
would
turn
his
dartagnans
absence
to
the
best
advantage
in
getting
rid
of
all
the
papers
memorandums
and
contracts
which
might
possibly
render
his
position
which
was
even
now
serious
enough
more
dangerous
than
ever
and
so
lifting
up
his
head
like
a
dog
who
has
regained
the
scent
he
perceived
an
odor
resembling
smoke
he
had
relied
on
finding
in
the
atmosphere
and
having
found
it
made
a
movement
of
his
head
in
token
of
satisfaction
as
dartagnan
entered
fouquet
on
his
side
raised
his
head
and
not
one
of
dartagnans
movements
escaped
him
and
then
the
looks
of
the
two
men
met
and
they
both
saw
that
they
had
understood
each
other
without
exchanging
a
syllable
well
asked
fouquet
the
first
to
speak
and
m
dherblay
upon
my
word
monseigneur
replied
dartagnan
m
dherblay
must
be
desperately
fond
of
walking
out
at
night
and
composing
verses
by
moonlight
in
the
park
of
vaux
with
some
of
your
poets
in
all
probability
for
he
is
not
in
his
own
room
what
not
in
his
own
room
cried
fouquet
whose
last
hope
thus
escaped
him
for
unless
he
could
ascertain
in
what
way
the
bishop
of
vannes
could
assist
him
he
perfectly
well
knew
that
he
could
expect
assistance
from
no
other
quarter
or
indeed
continued
dartagnan
if
he
is
in
his
own
room
he
has
very
good
reasons
for
not
answering
but
surely
you
did
not
call
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
have
heard
you
you
can
hardly
suppose
monseigneur
that
having
already
exceeded
my
orders
which
forbade
me
leaving
you
a
single
momentyou
can
hardly
suppose
i
say
that
i
should
have
been
mad
enough
to
rouse
the
whole
house
and
allow
myself
to
be
seen
in
the
corridor
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
in
order
that
m
colbert
might
state
with
positive
certainty
that
i
gave
you
time
to
burn
your
papers
my
papers
of
course
at
least
that
is
what
i
should
have
done
in
your
place
when
any
one
opens
a
door
for
me
i
always
avail
myself
of
it
yes
yes
and
i
thank
you
for
i
have
availed
myself
of
it
and
you
have
done
perfectly
right
every
man
has
his
own
peculiar
secrets
with
which
others
have
nothing
to
do
but
let
us
return
to
aramis
monseigneur
well
then
i
tell
you
you
could
not
have
called
loud
enough
or
aramis
would
have
heard
you
however
softly
any
one
may
call
aramis
monseigneur
aramis
always
hears
when
he
has
an
interest
in
hearing
i
repeat
what
i
said
beforearamis
was
not
in
his
own
room
or
aramis
had
certain
reasons
for
not
recognizing
my
voice
of
which
i
am
ignorant
and
of
which
you
may
be
even
ignorant
yourself
notwithstanding
your
liegeman
is
his
greatness
the
lord
bishop
of
vannes
fouquet
drew
a
deep
sigh
rose
from
his
seat
took
three
or
four
turns
in
his
room
and
finished
by
seating
himself
with
an
expression
of
extreme
dejection
upon
his
magnificent
bed
with
velvet
hangings
and
costliest
lace
dartagnan
looked
at
fouquet
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
and
sincerest
pity
i
have
seen
a
good
many
men
arrested
in
my
life
said
the
musketeer
sadly
i
have
seen
both
m
de
cinqmars
and
m
de
chalais
arrested
though
i
was
very
young
then
i
have
seen
m
de
conde
arrested
with
the
princes
i
have
seen
m
de
retz
arrested
i
have
seen
m
broussel
arrested
stay
a
moment
monseigneur
it
is
disagreeable
to
have
to
say
but
the
very
one
of
all
those
whom
you
most
resemble
at
this
moment
was
that
poor
fellow
broussel
you
were
very
near
doing
as
he
did
putting
your
dinner
napkin
in
your
portfolio
and
wiping
your
mouth
with
your
papers
mordioux
monseigneur
fouquet
a
man
like
you
ought
not
to
be
dejected
in
this
manner
suppose
your
friends
saw
you
monsieur
dartagnan
returned
the
surintendant
with
a
smile
full
of
gentleness
you
do
not
understand
me
it
is
precisely
because
my
friends
are
not
looking
on
that
i
am
as
you
see
me
now
i
do
not
live
exist
even
isolated
from
others
i
am
nothing
when
left
to
myself
understand
that
throughout
my
whole
life
i
have
passed
every
moment
of
my
time
in
making
friends
whom
i
hoped
to
render
my
stay
and
support
in
times
of
prosperity
all
these

in
harmonious
accents
the
murmur

my

isolation
i
have
never
yet
known
poverty
a
phantom
i
have
sometimes
beheld
clad
in
rags
awaiting
me
at
the
end
of
my
journey
through
lifepoverty
has
been
the
specter
with
which
many
of
my
own
friends
have
trifled
for
years
past
which
they
poetize
and
caress
and
which
has
attracted
me
towards
them
poverty
i
accept
it
acknowledge
it
receive
it
as
a
disinherited
sister
for
poverty
is
neither
solitude
nor
exile
nor
imprisonment
is
it
likely
i
shall
ever
be
poor
with
such
friends
as
pelisson
as
la
fontaine
as
moliere
with
such
a
mistress
asoh
if
you
knew
how
utterly
lonely
and
desolate
i
feel
at
this
moment
and
how
you
who
separate
me
from
all
i
love
seem
to
resemble
the
image
of
solitude
of
annihilationdeath
itself
but
i
have
already
told
you
monsieur
fouquet
replied
dartagnan
moved
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
that
you
are
woefully
exaggerating
the
king
likes
you
no
no
said
fouquet
shaking
his
head
m
colbert
hates
you
m
colbert
what
does
that
matter
to
me
he
will
ruin
you
ah
i
defy
him
to
do
that
for
i
am
ruined
already
at
this
singular
confession
of
the
superintendent
dartagnan
cast
his
glance
all
round
the
room
and
although
he
did
not
open
his
lips
fouquet
understood
him
so
thoroughly
that
he
added
what
can
be
done
with
such
wealth
of
substance
as
surrounds
us
when
a
man
can
no
longer
cultivate
his
taste
for
the
magnificent
do
you
know
what
good
the
greater
part
of
the
wealth
and
the
possessions
which
we
rich
enjoy
confer
upon
us
merely
to
disgust
us
by
their
very
splendor
even
with
everything
which
does
not
equal
it
vaux
you
will
say
and
the
wonders
of
vaux
what
of
it
what
boot
these
wonders
if
i
am
ruined
how
shall
i
fill
with
water
the
urns
which
my
naiads
bear
in
their
arms
or
force
the
air
into
the
lungs
of
my
tritons
to
be
rich
enough
monsieur
dartagnan
a
man
must
be
too
rich
dartagnan
shook
his
head
oh
i
know
very
well
what
you
think
replied
fouquet
quickly
if
vaux
were
yours
you
would
sell
it
and
would
purchase
an
estate
in
the
country
an
estate
which
should
have
woods
orchards
and
land
attached
so
that
the
estate
should
be
made
to
support
its
master
with
forty
millions
you
might
ten
millions
interrupted
dartagnan
not
a
million
my
dear
captain
no
one
in
france
is
rich
enough
to
give
two
millions
for
vaux
and
to
continue
to
maintain
it
as
i
have
done
no
one
could
do
it
no
one
would
know
how
well
said
dartagnan
in
any
case
a
million
is
not
abject
misery
it
is
not
far
from
it
my
dear
monsieur
but
you
do
not
understand
me
no
i
will
not
sell
my
residence
at
vaux
i
will
give
it
to
you
if
you
like
and
fouquet
accompanied
these
words
with
a
movement
of
the
shoulders
to
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
justice
give
it
to
the
king
you
will
make
a
better
bargain
the
king
does
not
require
me
to
give
it
to
him
said
fouquet
he
will
take
it
away
from
me
with
the
most
absolute
ease
and
grace
if
it
pleases
him
to
do
so
and
that
is
the
very
reason
i
should
prefer
to
see
it
perish
do
you
know
monsieur
dartagnan
that
if
the
king
did
not
happen
to
be
under
my
roof
i
would
take
this
candle
go
straight
to
the
dome
and
set
fire
to
a
couple
of
huge
chests
of
fusees
and
fireworks
which
are
in
reserve
there
and
would
reduce
my
palace
to
ashes
bah
said
the
musketeer
negligently
at
all
events
you
would
not
be
able
to
burn
the
gardens
and
that
is
the
finest
feature
of
the
place
and
yet
resumed
fouquet
thoughtfully
what
was
i
saying
great
heavens
burn
vaux
destroy
my
palace
but
vaux
is
not
mine
these
wonderful
creations
are
it
is
true
the
property
as
far
as
sense
of
enjoyment
goes
of
the
man
who
has
paid
for
them
but
as
far
as
duration
is
concerned
they
belong
to
those
who
created
them
vaux
belongs
to
lebrun
to
lenotre
to
pelisson
to
levau
to
la
fontaine
to
moliere
vaux
belongs
to
posterity
in
fact
you
see
monsieur
dartagnan
that
my
very
house
has
ceased
to
be
my
own
that
is
all
well
and
good
said
dartagnan
the
idea
is
agreeable
enough
and
i
recognize
m
fouquet
himself
in
it
that
idea
indeed
makes
me
forget
that
poor
fellow
broussel
altogether
and
i
now
fail
to
recognize
in
you
the
whining
complaints
of
that
old
frondeur
if
you
are
ruined
monsieur
look
at
the
affair
manfully
for
you
too
mordioux
belong
to
posterity
and
have
no
right
to
lessen
yourself
in
any
way
stay
a
moment
look
at
me
i
who
seem
to
exercise
in
some
degree
a
kind
of
superiority
over
you
because
i
am
arresting
you
fate
which
distributes
their
different
parts
to
the
comedians
of
this
world
accorded
me
a
less
agreeable
and
less
advantageous
part
to
fill
than
yours
has
been
i
am
one
of
those
who
think
that
the
parts
which
kings
and
powerful
nobles
are
called
upon
to
act
are
infinitely
of
more
worth
than
the
parts
of
beggars
or
lackeys
it
is
far
better
on
the
stageon
the
stage
i
mean
of
another
theater
than
the
theater
of
this
worldit
is
far
better
to
wear
a
fine
coat
and
to
talk
a
fine
language
than
to
walk
the
boards
shod
with
a
pair
of
old
shoes
or
to
get
ones
backbone
gently
polished
by
a
hearty
dressing
with
a
stick
in
one
word
you
have
been
a
prodigal
with
money
you
have
ordered
and
been
obeyedhave
been
steeped
to
the
lips
in
enjoyment
while
i
have
dragged
my
tether
after
me
have
been
commanded
and
have
obeyed
and
have
drudged
my
life
away
well
although
i
may
seem
of
such
trifling
importance
beside
you
monseigneur
i
do
declare
to
you
that
the
recollection
of
what
i
have
done
serves
me
as
a
spur
and
prevents
me
from
bowing
my
old
head
too
soon
i
shall
remain
unto
the
very
end
a
trooper
and
when
my
turn
comes
i
shall
fall
perfectly
straight
all
in
a
heap
still
alive
after
having
selected
my
place
beforehand
do
as
i
do
monsieur
fouquet
you
will
not
find
yourself
the
worse
for
it
a
fall
happens
only
once
in
a
lifetime
to
men
like
yourself
and
the
chief
thing
is
to
take
it
gracefully
when
the
chance
presents
itself
there
is
a
latin
proverbthe
words
have
escaped
me
but
i
remember
the
sense
of
it
very
well
for
i
have
thought
over
it
more
than
oncewhich
says
the
end
crowns
the
work
fouquet
rose
from
his
seat
passed
his
arm
round
dartagnans
neck
and
clasped
him
in
a
close
embrace
whilst
with
the
other
hand
he
pressed
his
hand
an
excellent
homily
he
said
after
a
moments
pause
a
soldiers
monseigneur
you
have
a
regard
for
me
in
telling
me
all
that
perhaps
fouquet
resumed
his
pensive
attitude
once
more
and
then
a
moment
after
he
said
where
can
m
dherblay
be
i
dare
not
ask
you
to
send
for
him
you
would
not
ask
me
because
i
would
not
do
it
monsieur
fouquet
people
would
learn
it
and
aramis
who
is
not
mixed
up
with
the
affair
might
possibly
be
compromised
and
included
in
your
disgrace
i
will
wait
here
till
daylight
said
fouquet
yes
that
is
best
what
shall
we
do
when
daylight
comes
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
monseigneur
monsieur
dartagnan
will
you
do
me
a
favor
most
willingly
you
guard
me
i
remain
you
are
acting
in
the
full
discharge
of
your
duty
i
suppose
certainly
very
good
then
remain
as
close
to
me
as
my
shadow
if
you
like
and
i
infinitely
prefer
such
a
shadow
to
any
one
else
dartagnan
bowed
to
the
compliment
but
forget
that
you
are
monsieur
dartagnan
captain
of
the
musketeers
forget
that
i
am
monsieur
fouquet
surintendant
of
the
finances
and
let
us
talk
about
my
affairs
that
is
rather
a
delicate
subject
indeed
yes
but
for
your
sake
monsieur
fouquet
i
will
do
what
may
almost
be
regarded
as
an
impossibility
thank
you
what
did
the
king
say
to
you
nothing
ah
is
that
the
way
you
talk
the
deuce
what
do
you
think
of
my
situation
i
do
not
know
however
unless
you
have
some
ill
feeling
against
me
your
position
is
a
difficult
one
in
what
respect
because
you
are
under
your
own
roof
however
difficult
it
may
be
i
understand
it
very
well
do
you
suppose
that
with
any
one
else
but
yourself
i
should
have
shown
so
much
frankness
what
so
much
frankness
do
you
say
you
who
refuse
to
tell
me
the
slightest
thing
at
all
events
then
so
much
ceremony
and
consideration
ah
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
that
respect
one
moment
monseigneur
let
me
tell
you
how
i
should
have
behaved
towards
any
one
but
yourself
it
might
be
that
i
happened
to
arrive
at
your
door
just
as
your
guests
or
your
friends
had
left
youor
if
they
had
not
gone
yet
i
should
wait
until
they
were
leaving
and
should
then
catch
them
one
after
the
other
like
rabbits
i
should
lock
them
up
quietly
enough
i
should
steal
softly
along
the
carpet
of
your
corridor
and
with
one
hand
upon
you
before
you
suspected
the
slightest
thing
amiss
i
should
keep
you
safely
until
my
masters
breakfast
in
the
morning
in
this
way
i
should
just
the
same
have
avoided
all
publicity
all
disturbance
all
opposition
but
there
would
also
have
been
no
warning
for
m
fouquet
no
consideration
for
his
feelings
none
of
those
delicate
concessions
which
are
shown
by
persons
who
are
essentially
courteous
in
their
natures
whenever
the
decisive
moment
may
arrive
are
you
satisfied
with
the
plan
it
makes
me
shudder
i
thought
you
would
not
like
it
it
would
have
been
very
disagreeable
to
have
made
my
appearance
tomorrow
without
any
preparation
and
to
have
asked
you
to
deliver
up
your
sword
oh
monsieur
i
should
have
died
of
shame
and
anger
your
gratitude
is
too
eloquently
expressed
i
have
not
done
enough
to
deserve
it
i
assure
you
most
certainly
monsieur
you
will
never
get
me
to
believe
that
well
then
monseigneur
if
you
are
satisfied
with
what
i
have
done
and
have
somewhat
recovered
from
the
shock
which
i
prepared
you
for
as
much
as
i
possibly
could
let
us
allow
the
few
hours
that
remain
to
pass
away
undisturbed
you
are
harassed
and
should
arrange
your
thoughts
i
beg
you
therefore
go
to
sleep
or
pretend
to
go
to
sleep
either
on
your
bed
or
in
your
bed
i
will
sleep
in
this
armchair
and
when
i
fall
asleep
my
rest
is
so
sound
that
a
cannon
would
not
wake
me
fouquet
smiled
i
expect
however
continued
the
musketeer
the
case
of
a
door
being
opened
whether
a
secret
door
or
any
other
or
the
case
of
any
one
going
out
of
or
coming
into
the
roomfor
anything
like
that
my
ear
is
as
quick
and
sensitive
as
the
ear
of
a
mouse
creaking
noises
make
me
start
it

i
suppose
from
a
natural
antipathy
to
anything
of
the
kind

about
as
much
as
you
like

up

down
in
any
part
of
the
room
write
efface

like
that
will
prevent
me
from
going
to
sleep
or
even
prevent
me
from
snoring
but
do
not
touch
either
the
key
or
the
handle
of
the
door
for
i
should
start
up
in
a
moment
and
that
would
shake
my
nerves
and
make
me
ill
monsieur
dartagnan
said
fouquet
you
are
certainly
the
most
witty
and
the
most
courteous
man
i
ever
met
with
and
you
will
leave
me
only
one
regret
that
of
having
made
your
acquaintance
so
late
dartagnan
drew
a
deep
sigh
which
seemed
to
say
alas
you
have
perhaps
made
it
too
soon
he
then
settled
himself
in
his
armchair
while
fouquet
half
lying
on
his
bed
and
leaning
on
his
arm
was
meditating
on
his
misadventures
in
this
way
both
of
them
leaving
the
candles
burning
awaited
the
first
dawn
of
the
day
and
when
fouquet
happened
to
sigh
too
loudly
dartagnan
only
snored
the
louder
not
a
single
visit
not
even
from
aramis
disturbed
their
quietude
not
a
sound
even
was
heard
throughout
the
whole
vast
palace
outside
however
the
guards
of
honor
on
duty
and
the
patrol
of
musketeers
paced
up
and
down
and
the
sound
of
their
feet
could
be
heard
on
the
gravel
walks
it
seemed
to
act
as
an
additional
soporific
for
the
sleepers
while
the
murmuring
of
the
wind
through
the
trees
and
the
unceasing
music
of
the
fountains
whose
waters
tumbled
in
the
basin
still
went
on
uninterruptedly
without
being
disturbed
at
the
slight
noises
and
items
of
little
moment
that
constitute
the
life
and
death
of
human
nature
chapter
xx
the
morning
in
vivid
contrast
to
the
sad
and
terrible
destiny
of
the
king
imprisoned
in
the
bastile
and
tearing
in
sheer
despair
the
bolts
and
bars
of
his
dungeon
the
rhetoric
of
the
chroniclers
of
old
would
not
fail
to
present
as
a
complete
antithesis
the
picture
of
philippe
lying
asleep
beneath
the
royal
canopy
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
such
rhetoric
is
always
bad
and
always
scatters
in
places
where
they
have
no
right
to
grow
the
flowers
with
which
it
embellishes
and
enlivens
history
but
we
shall
on
the
present
occasion
carefully
avoid
polishing
the
antithesis
in
question
but
shall
proceed
to
draw
another
picture
as
minutely
as
possible
to
serve
as
foil
and
counterfoil
to
the
one
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
young
prince
alighted
from
aramiss
room
in
the
same
way
the
king
had
descended
from
the
apartment
dedicated
to
morpheus
the
dome
gradually
and
slowly
sank
down
under
aramiss
pressure
and
philippe
stood
beside
the
royal
bed
which
had
ascended
again
after
having
deposited
its
prisoner
in
the
secret
depths
of
the
subterranean
passage
alone
in
the
presence
of
all
the
luxury
which
surrounded
him
alone
in
the
presence
of
his
power
alone
with
the
part
he
was
about
to
be
forced
to
act
philippe
for
the
first
time
felt
his
heart
and
mind
and
soul
expand
beneath
the
influence
of
a
thousand
mutable
emotions
which
are
the
vital
throbs
of
a
kings
heart
he
could
not
help
changing
color
when
he
looked
upon
the
empty
bed
still
tumbled
by
his
brothers
body
this
mute
accomplice
had
returned
after
having
completed
the
work
it
had
been
destined
to
perform
it
returned
with
the
traces
of
the
crime
it
spoke
to
the
guilty
author
of
that
crime
with
the
frank
and
unreserved
language
which
an
accomplice
never
fears
to
use
in
the
company
of
his
companion
in
guilt
for
it
spoke
the
truth
philippe
bent
over
the
bed
and
perceived
a
pockethandkerchief
lying
on
it
which
was
still
damp
from
the
cold
sweat
which
had
poured
from
louis
xivs
face
this
sweatbestained
handkerchief
terrified
philippe
as
the
gore
of
abel
frightened
cain
i
am
face
to
face
with
my
destiny
said
philippe
his
eyes
on
fire
and
his
face
a
livid
white
is
it
likely
to
be
more
terrifying
than
my
captivity
has
been
sad
and
gloomy
though
i
am
compelled
to
follow
out
at
every
moment
the
sovereign
power
and
authority
i
have
usurped
shall
i
cease
to
listen
to
the
scruples
of
my
heart
yes
the
king
has
lain
on
this
bed
it
is
indeed
his
head
that
has
left
its
impression
on
this
pillow
his
bitter
tears
that
have
stained
this
handkerchief
and
yet
i
hesitate
to
throw
myself
on
the
bed
or
to
press
in
my
hand
the
handkerchief
which
is
embroidered
with
my
brothers
arms
away
with
such
weakness
let
me
imitate
m
dherblay
who
asserts
that
a
mans
action
should
be
always
one
degree
above
his
thoughts
let
me
imitate
m
dherblay
whose
thoughts
are
of
and
for
himself
alone
who
regards
himself
as
a
man
of
honor
so
long
as
he
injures
or
betrays
his
enemies
only
i
i
alone
should
have
occupied
this
bed
if
louis
xiv
had
not
owing
to
my
mothers
criminal
abandonment
stood
in
my
way
and
this
handkerchief
embroidered
with
the
arms
of
france
would
in
right
and
justice
belong
to
me
alone
if
as
m
dherblay
observes
i
had
been
left
my
royal
cradle
philippe
son
of
france
take
your
place
on
that
bed
philippe
sole
king
of
france
resume
the
blazonry
that
is
yours
philippe
sole
heir
presumptive
to
louis
xiii
your
father
show
yourself
without
pity
or
mercy
for
the
usurper
who
at
this
moment
has
not
even
to
suffer
the
agony
of
the
remorse
of
all
that
you
have
had
to
submit
to
with
these
words
philippe
notwithstanding
an
instinctive
repugnance
of
feeling
and
in
spite
of
the
shudder
of
terror
which
mastered
his
will
threw
himself
on
the
royal
bed
and
forced
his
muscles
to
press
the
still
warm
place
where
louis
xiv
had
lain
while
he
buried
his
burning
face
in
the
handkerchief
still
moistened
by
his
brothers
tears
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
buried
in
the
soft
down
of
his
pillow
philippe
perceived
above
him
the
crown
of
france
suspended
as
we
have
stated
by
angels
with
outspread
golden
wings
a
man
may
be
ambitious
of
lying
in
a
lions
den
but
can
hardly
hope
to
sleep
there
quietly
philippe
listened
attentively
to
every
sound
his
heart
panted
and
throbbed
at
the
very
suspicion
of
approaching
terror
and
misfortune
but
confident
in
his
own
strength
which
was
confirmed
by
the
force
of
an
overpoweringly
resolute
determination
he
waited
until
some
decisive
circumstance
should
permit
him
to
judge
for
himself
he
hoped
that
imminent
danger
might
be
revealed
to
him
like
those
phosphoric
lights
of
the
tempest
which
show
the
sailors
the
altitude
of
the
waves
against
which
they
have
to
struggle
but
nothing
approached
silence
that
mortal
enemy
of
restless
hearts
and
of
ambitious
minds
shrouded
in
the
thickness
of
its
gloom
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
the
future
king
of
france
who
lay
there
sheltered
beneath
his
stolen
crown
towards
the
morning
a
shadow
rather
than
a
body
glided
into
the
royal
chamber
philippe
expected
his
approach
and
neither
expressed
nor
exhibited
any
surprise
well
m
dherblay
well
sire
all
is
accomplished
how
exactly
as
we
expected
did
he
resist
terribly
tears
and
entreaties
and
then
a
perfect
stupor
but
at
last
oh
at
last
a
complete
victory
and
absolute
silence
did
the
governor
of
the
bastile
suspect
anything
nothing
the
resemblance
however
was
the
cause
of
the
success
but
the
prisoner
cannot
fail
to
explain
himself
think
well
of
that
i
have
myself
been
able
to
do
as
much
as
that
on
former
occasion
i
have
already
provided
for
every
chance
in
a
few
days
sooner
if
necessary
we
will
take
the
captive
out
of
his
prison
and
will
send
him
out
of
the
country
to
a
place
of
exile
so
remote
people
can
return
from
their
exile
monsieur
dherblay
to
a
place
of
exile
so
distant
i
was
going
to
say
that
human
strength
and
the
duration
of
human
life
would
not
be
enough
for
his
return
once
more
a
cold
look
of
intelligence
passed
between
aramis
and
the
young
king
and
m
du
vallon
asked
philippe
in
order
to
change
the
conversation
he
will
be
presented
to
you
today
and
confidentially
will
congratulate
you
on
the
danger
which
that
conspirator
has
made
you
run
what
is
to
be
done
with
him
with
m
du
vallon
yes
confer
a
dukedom
on
him
i
suppose
a
dukedom
replied
aramis
smiling
in
a
significant
manner
why
do
you
laugh
monsieur
dherblay
i
laugh
at
the
extreme
caution
of
your
idea
cautious
why
so
your
majesty
is
doubtless
afraid
that
poor
porthos
may
possible
become
a
troublesome
witness
and
you
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
what
in
making
him
a
duke
certainly
you
would
assuredly
kill
him
for
he
would
die
from
joy
and
the
secret
would
die
with
him
good
heavens
yes
said
aramis
phlegmatically
i
should
lose
a
very
good
friend
at
this
moment
and
in
the
middle
of
this
idle
conversation
under
the
light
tone
of
which
the
two
conspirators
concealed
their
joy
and
pride
at
their
mutual
success
aramis
heard
something
which
made
him
prick
up
his
ears
what
is
that
said
philippe
the
dawn
sire
well
well
before
you
retired
to
bed
last
night
you
probably
decided
to
do
something
this
morning
at
break
of
day
yes
i
told
my
captain
of
the
musketeers
replied
the
young
man
hurriedly
that
i
should
expect
him
if
you
told
him
that
he
will
certainly
be
here
for
he
is
a
most
punctual
man
i
hear
a
step
in
the
vestibule
it
must
be
he
come
let
us
begin
the
attack
said
the
young
king
resolutely
be
cautious
for
heavens
sake
to
begin
the
attack
and
with
dartagnan
would
be
madness
dartagnan
knows
nothing
he
has
seen
nothing
he
is
a
hundred
miles
from
suspecting
our
mystery
in
the
slightest
degree
but
if
he
comes
into
this
room
the
first
this
morning
he
will
be
sure
to
detect
something
of
what
has
taken
place
and
which
he
would
imagine
it
his
business
to
occupy
himself
about
before
we
allow
dartagnan
to
penetrate
into
this
room
we
must
air
the
room
thoroughly
or
introduce
so
many
people
into
it
that
the
keenest
scent
in
the
whole
kingdom
may
be
deceived
by
the
traces
of
twenty
different
persons
but
how
can
i
send
him
away
since
i
have
given
him
a
rendezvous
observed
the
prince
impatient
to
measure
swords
with
so
redoubtable
an
antagonist
i
will
take
care
of
that
replied
the
bishop
and
in
order
to
begin
i
am
going
to
strike
a
blow
which
will
completely
stupefy
our
man
he
too
is
striking
a
blow
for
i
hear
him
at
the
door
added
the
prince
hurriedly
and
in
fact
a
knock
at
the
door
was
heard
at
that
moment
aramis
was
not
mistaken
for
it
was
indeed
dartagnan
who
adopted
that
mode
of
announcing
himself
we
have
seen
how
he
passed
the
night
in
philosophizing
with
m
fouquet
but
the
musketeer
was
very
weary
even
of
feigning
to
fall
asleep
and
as
soon
as
earliest
dawn
illumined
with
its
gloomy
gleams
of
light
the
sumptuous
cornices
of
the
superintendents
room
dartagnan
rose
from
his
armchair
arranged
his
sword
brushed
his
coat
and
hat
with
his
sleeve
like
a
private
soldier
getting
ready
for
inspection
are
you
going
out
said
fouquet
yes
monseigneur
and
you
i
shall
remain
you
pledge
your
word
certainly
very
good
besides
my
only
reason
for
going
out
is
to
try
and
get
that
replyyou
know
what
i
mean
that
sentence
you
mean
stay
i
have
something
of
the
old
roman
in
me
this
morning
when
i
got
up
i
remarked
that
my
sword
had
got
caught
in
one
of
the
aiguillettes
and
that
my
shoulderbelt
had
slipped
quite
off
that
is
an
infallible
sign
of
prosperity
yes
be
sure
of
it
for
every
time
that
that
confounded
belt
of
mine
stuck
fast
to
my
back
it
always
signified
a
punishment
from
m
de
treville
or
a
refusal
of
money
by
m
de
mazarin
every
time
my
sword
hung
fast
to
my
shoulderbelt
it
always
predicted
some
disagreeable
commission
or
another
for
me
to
execute
and
i
have
had
showers
of
them
all
my
life
through
every
time
too
my
sword
danced
about
in
its
sheath
a
duel
fortunate
in
its
result
was
sure
to
follow
whenever
it
dangled
about
the
calves
of
my
legs
it
signified
a
slight
wound
every
time
it
fell
completely
out
of
the
scabbard
i
was
booked
and
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
have
to
remain
on
the
field
of
battle
with
two
or
three
months
under
surgical
bandages
into
the
bargain
i
did
not
know
your
sword
kept
you
so
well
informed
said
fouquet
with
a
faint
smile
which
showed
how
he
was
struggling
against
his
own
weakness
is
your
sword
bewitched
or
under
the
influence
of
some
imperial
charm
why
you
must
know
that
my
sword
may
almost
be
regarded
as
part
of
my
own
body
i
have
heard
that
certain
men
seem
to
have
warnings
given
them
by
feeling
something
the
matter
with
their
legs
or
a
throbbing
of
their
temples
with
me
it
is
my
sword
that
warns
me
well
it
told
me
of
nothing
this
morning
but
stay
a
momentlook
here
it
has
just
fallen
of
its
own
accord
into
the
last
hole
of
the
belt
do
you
know
what
that
is
a
warning
of
no
well
that
tells
me
of
an
arrest
that
will
have
to
be
made
this
very
day
well
said
the
surintendant
more
astonished
than
annoyed
by
this
frankness
if
there
is
nothing
disagreeable
predicted
to
you
by
your
sword
i
am
to
conclude
that
it
is
not
disagreeable
for
you
to
arrest
me
you
arrest
you
of
course
the
warning
does
not
concern
you
since
you
have
been
arrested
ever
since
yesterday
it
is
not
you
i
shall
have
to
arrest
be
assured
of
that
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
delighted
and
also
the
reason
why
i
said
that
my
day
will
be
a
happy
one
and
with
these
words
pronounced
with
the
most
affectionate
graciousness
of
manner
the
captain
took
leave
of
fouquet
in
order
to
wait
upon
the
king
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
when
fouquet
said
to
him
one
last
mark
of
kindness
what
is
it
monseigneur
m
dherblay
let
me
see
monsieur
dherblay
i
am
going
to
try
and
get
him
to
come
to
you
dartagnan
did
not
think
himself
so
good
a
prophet
it
was
written
that
the
day
would
pass
away
and
realize
all
the
predictions
that
had
been
made
in
the
morning
he
had
accordingly
knocked
as
we
have
seen
at
the
kings
door
the
door
opened
the
captain
thought
that
it
was
the
king
who
had
just
opened
it
himself
and
this
supposition
was
not
altogether
inadmissible
considering
the
state
of
agitation
in
which
he
had
left
louis
xiv
the
previous
evening
but
instead
of
his
royal
master
whom
he
was
on
the
point
of
saluting
with
the
greatest
respect
he
perceived
the
long
calm
features
of
aramis
so
extreme
was
his
surprise
that
he
could
hardly
refrain
from
uttering
a
loud
exclamation
aramis
he
said
good
morning
dear
dartagnan
replied
the
prelate
coldly
you
here
stammered
out
the
musketeer
his
majesty
desires
you
to
report
that
he
is
still
sleeping
after
having
been
greatly
fatigued
during
the
whole
night
ah
said
dartagnan
who
could
not
understand
how
the
bishop
of
vannes
who
had
been
so
indifferent
a
favorite
the
previous
evening
had
become
in
half
a
dozen
hours
the
most
magnificent
mushroom
of
fortune
that
had
ever
sprung
up
in
a
sovereigns
bedroom
in
fact
to
transmit
the
orders
of
the
king
even
to
the
mere
threshold
of
that
monarchs
room
to
serve
as
an
intermediary
of
louis
xiv
so
as
to
be
able
to
give
a
single
order
in
his
name
at
a
couple
paces
from
him
he
must
have
become
more
than
richelieu
had
ever
been
to
louis
xiii
dartagnans
expressive
eye
halfopened
lips
his
curling
mustache
said
as
much
indeed
in
the
plainest
language
to
the
chief
favorite
who
remained
calm
and
perfectly
unmoved
moreover
continued
the
bishop
you
will
be
good
enough
monsieur
le
capitaine
des
mousquetaires
to
allow
those
only
to
pass
into
the
kings
room
this
morning
who
have
special
permission
his
majesty
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
just
yet
but
objected
dartagnan
almost
on
the
point
of
refusing
to
obey
this
order
and
particularly
of
giving
unrestrained
passage
to
the
suspicions
which
the
kings
silence
had
arousedbut
monsieur
leveque
his
majesty
gave
me
a
rendezvous
for
this
morning
later
later
said
the
kings
voice
from
the
bottom
of
the
alcove
a
voice
which
made
a
cold
shudder
pass
through
the
musketeers
veins
he
bowed
amazed
confused
and
stupefied
by
the
smile
with
which
aramis
seemed
to
overwhelm
him
as
soon
as
these
words
had
been
pronounced
and
then
continued
the
bishop
as
an
answer
to
what
you
were
coming
to
ask
the
king
my
dear
dartagnan
here
is
an
order
of
his
majesty
which
you
will
be
good
enough
to
attend
to
forthwith
for
it
concerns
m
fouquet
dartagnan
took
the
order
which
was
held
out
to
him
to
be
set
at
liberty
he
murmured
ah
and
he
uttered
a
second
ah
still
more
full
of
intelligence
than
the
former
for
this
order
explained
aramiss
presence
with
the
king
and
that
aramis
in
order
to
have
obtained
fouquets
pardon
must
have
made
considerable
progress
in
the
royal
favor
and
that
this
favor
explained
in
its
tenor
the
hardly
conceivable
assurance
with
which
m
dherblay
issued
the
order
in
the
kings
name
for
dartagnan
it
was
quite
sufficient
to
have
understood
something
of
the
matter
in
hand
to
order
to
understand
the
rest
he
bowed
and
withdrew
a
couple
of
paces
as
though
he
were
about
to
leave
i
am
going
with
you
said
the
bishop
where
to
to
m
fouquet
i
wish
to
be
a
witness
of
his
delight
ah
aramis
how
you
puzzled
me
just
now
said
dartagnan
again
but
you
understand
now
i
suppose
of
course
i
understand
he
said
aloud
but
added
in
a
low
tone
to
himself
almost
hissing
the
words
between
his
teeth
no
no
i
do
not
understand
yet
but
it
is
all
the
same
for
here
is
the
order
for
it
and
then
he
added
i
will
lead
the
way
monseigneur
and
he
conducted
aramis
to
fouquets
apartments
chapter
xxi
the
kings
friend
fouquet
was
waiting
with
anxiety
he
had
already
sent
away
many
of
his
servants
and
friends
who
anticipating
the
usual
hour
of
his
ordinary
receptions
had
called
at
his
door
to
inquire
after
him
preserving
the
utmost
silence
respecting
the
danger
which
hung
suspended
by
a
hair
above
his
head
he
only
asked
them
as
he
did
every
one
indeed
who
came
to
the
door
where
aramis
was
when
he
saw
dartagnan
return
and
when
he
perceived
the
bishop
of
vannes
behind
him
he
could
hardly
restrain
his
delight
it
was
fully
equal
to
his
previous
uneasiness
the
mere
sight
of
aramis
was
a
complete
compensation
to
the
surintendant
for
the
unhappiness
he
had
undergone
in
his
arrest
the
prelate
was
silent
and
grave
dartagnan
completely
bewildered
by
such
an
accumulation
of
events
well
captain
so
you
have
brought
m
dherblay
to
me
and
something
better
still
monseigneur
what
is
that
liberty
i
am
free
yes
by
the
kings
order
fouquet
resumed
his
usual
serenity
that
he
might
interrogate
aramis
with
a
look
oh
yes
you
can
thank
m
leveque
de
vannes
pursued
dartagnan
for
it
is
indeed
to
him
that
you
owe
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
the
king
oh
said
fouquet
more
humiliated
at
the
service
than
grateful
at
its
success
but
you
continued
dartagnan
addressing
aramisyou
who
have
become
m
fouquets
protector
and
patron
can
you
not
do
something
for
me
anything
in
the
wide
world
you
like
my
friend
replied
the
bishop
in
his
calmest
tones
one
thing
only
then
and
i
shall
be
perfectly
satisfied
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
to
become
the
favorite
of
the
king
you
who
have
never
spoken
to
him
more
than
twice
in
your
life
from
a
friend
such
as
you
are
said
aramis
i
cannot
conceal
anything
ah
very
good
tell
me
then
very
well
you
think
that
i
have
seen
the
king
only
twice
whilst
the
fact
is
i
have
seen
him
more
than
a
hundred
times
only
we
have
kept
it
very
secret
that
is
all
and
without
trying
to
remove
the
color
which
at
this
revelation
made
dartagnans
face
flush
scarlet
aramis
turned
towards
m
fouquet
who
was
as
much
surprised
as
the
musketeer
monseigneur
he
resumed
the
king
desires
me
to
inform
you
that
he
is
more
than
ever
your
friend
and
that
your
beautiful
fete
so
generously
offered
by
you
on
his
behalf
has
touched
him
to
the
very
heart
and
thereupon
he
saluted
m
fouquet
with
so
much
reverence
of
manner
that
the
latter
incapable
of
understanding
a
man
whose
diplomacy
was
of
so
prodigious
a
character
remained
incapable
of
uttering
a
single
syllable
and
equally
incapable
of
thought
or
movement
dartagnan
fancied
he
perceived
that
these
two
men
had
something
to
say
to
each
other
and
he
was
about
to
yield
to
that
feeling
of
instinctive
politeness
which
in
such
a
case
hurries
a
man
towards
the
door
when
he
feels
his
presence
is
an
inconvenience
for
others
but
his
eager
curiosity
spurred
on
by
so
many
mysteries
counseled
him
to
remain
aramis
thereupon
turned
towards
him
and
said
in
a
quiet
tone
you
will
not
forget
my
friend
the
kings
order
respecting
those
whom
he
intends
to
receive
this
morning
on
rising
these
words
were
clear
enough
and
the
musketeer
understood
them
he
therefore
bowed
to
fouquet
and
then
to
aramisto
the
latter
with
a
slight
admixture
of
ironical
respectand
disappeared
no
sooner
had
he
left
than
fouquet
whose
impatience
had
hardly
been
able
to
wait
for
that
moment
darted
towards
the
door
to
close
it
and
then
returning
to
the
bishop
he
said
my
dear
dherblay
i
think
it
now
high
time
you
should
explain
all
that
has
passed
for
in
plain
and
honest
truth
i
do
not
understand
anything
we
will
explain
all
that
to
you
said
aramis
sitting
down
and
making
fouquet
sit
down
also
where
shall
i
begin
with
this
first
of
all
why
does
the
king
set
me
at
liberty
you
ought
rather
to
ask
me
what
his
reason
was
for
having
you
arrested
since
my
arrest
i
have
had
time
to
think
over
it
and
my
idea
is
that
it
arises
out
of
some
slight
feeling
of
jealousy
my
fete
put
m
colbert
out
of
temper
and
m
colbert
discovered
some
cause
of
complaint
against
me
belleisle
for
instance
no
there
is
no
question
at
all
just
now
of
belleisle
what
is
it
then
do
you
remember
those
receipts
for
thirteen
millions
which
m
de
mazarin
contrived
to
steal
from
you
yes
of
course
well
you
are
pronounced
a
public
robber
good
heavens
oh
that
is
not
all
do
you
also
remember
that
letter
you
wrote
to
la
valliere
alas
yes
and
that
proclaims
you
a
traitor
and
a
suborner
why
should
he
have
pardoned
me
then
we
have
not
yet
arrived
at
that
part
of
our
argument
i
wish
you
to
be
quite
convinced
of
the
fact
itself
observe
this
well
the
king
knows
you
to
be
guilty
of
an
appropriation
of
public
funds
oh
of
course
i
know
that
you
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
but
at
all
events
the
king
has
seen
the
receipts
and
he
can
do
no
other
than
believe
you
are
incriminated
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
not
see
you
will
see
presently
though
the
king
moreover
having
read
your
loveletter
to
la
valliere
and
the
offers
you
there
made
her
cannot
retain
any
doubt
of
your
intentions
with
regard
to
that
young
lady
you
will
admit
that
i
suppose
certainly
pray
conclude
in
the
fewest
words
the
king
we
may
henceforth
assume
is
your
powerful
implacable
and
eternal
enemy
agreed
but
am
i
then
so
powerful
that
he
has
not
dared
to
sacrifice
me
notwithstanding
his
hatred
with
all
the
means
which
my
weakness
or
my
misfortunes
may
have
given
him
as
a
hold
upon
me
it
is
clear
beyond
all
doubt
pursued
aramis
coldly
that
the
king
has
quarreled
with
youirreconcilably
but
since
he
has
absolved
me
do
you
believe
it
likely
asked
the
bishop
with
a
searching
look
without
believing
in
his
sincerity
i
believe
it
in
the
accomplished
fact
aramis
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
why
then
should
louis
xiv
have
commissioned
you
to
tell
me
what
you
have
just
stated
the
king
charged
me
with
no
message
for
you
with
nothing
said
the
superintendent
stupefied
but
that
order
oh
yes
you
are
quite
right
there
is
an
order
certainly
and
these
words
were
pronounced
by
aramis
in
so
strange
a
tone
that
fouquet
could
not
resist
starting
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
i
see
what
is
it
aramis
softly
rubbed
his
white
fingers
over
his
chin
but
said
nothing
does
the
king
exile
me
do
not
act
as
if
you
were
playing
at
the
game
children
play
at
when
they
have
to
try
and
guess
where
a
thing
has
been
hidden
and
are
informed
by
a
bell
being
rung
when
they
are
approaching
near
to
it
or
going
away
from
it
speak
then
guess
you
alarm
me
bah
that
is
because
you
have
not
guessed
then
what
did
the
king
say
to
you
in
the
name
of
our
friendship
do
not
deceive
me
the
king
has
not
said
one
word
to
me
you
are
killing
me
with
impatience
dherblay
am
i
still
superintendent
as
long
as
you
like
but
what
extraordinary
empire
have
you
so
suddenly
acquired
over
his
majestys
mind
ah
thats
the
point
he
does
your
bidding
i
believe
so
it
is
hardly
credible
so
any
one
would
say
dherblay
by
our
alliance
by
our
friendship
by
everything
you
hold
dearest
in
the
world
speak
openly
i
implore
you
by
what
means
have
you
succeeded
in
overcoming
louis
xivs
prejudices
for
he
did
not
like
you
i
am
certain
the
king
will
like
me
now
said
aramis
laying
stress
upon
the
last
word
you
have
something
particular
then
between
you
yes
a
secret
perhaps
a
secret
a
secret
of
such
a
nature
as
to
change
his
majestys
interests
you
are
indeed
a
man
of
superior
intelligence
monseigneur
and
have
made
a
particularly
accurate
guess
i
have
in
fact
discovered
a
secret
of
a
nature
to
change
the
interests
of
the
king
of
france
ah
said
fouquet
with
the
reserve
of
a
man
who
does
not
wish
to
ask
any
more
questions
and
you
shall
judge
of
it
yourself
pursued
aramis
and
you
shall
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken
with
regard
to
the
importance
of
this
secret
i
am
listening
since
you
are
good
enough
to
unbosom
yourself
to
me
only
do
not
forget
that
i
have
asked
you
about
nothing
which
it
may
be
indiscreet
in
you
to
communicate
aramis
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
collecting
himself
do
not
speak
said
fouquet
there
is
still
time
enough
do
you
remember
said
the
bishop
casting
down
his
eyes
the
birth
of
louis
xiv
as
if
it
were
yesterday
have
you
ever
heard
anything
particular
respecting
his
birth
nothing
except
that
the
king
was
not
really
the
son
of
louis
xiii
that
does
not
matter
to
us
or
the
kingdom
either
he
is
the
son
of
his
father
says
the
french
law
whose
father
is
recognized
by
law
true
but
it
is
a
grave
matter
when
the
quality
of
races
is
called
into
question
a
merely
secondary
question
after
all
so
that
in
fact
you
have
never
learned
or
heard
anything
in
particular
nothing
that
is
where
my
secret
begins
the
queen
you
must
know
instead
of
being
delivered
of
a
son
was
delivered
of
twins
fouquet
looked
up
suddenly
as
he
replied
and
the
second
is
dead
you
will
see
these
twins
seemed
likely
to
be
regarded
as
the
pride
of
their
mother
and
the
hope
of
france
but
the
weak
nature
of
the
king
his
superstitious
feelings
made
him
apprehend
a
series
of
conflicts
between
two
children
whose
rights
were
equal
so
he
put
out
of
the
wayhe
suppressedone
of
the
twins
suppressed
do
you
say
have
patience
both
the
children
grew
up
the
one
on
the
throne
whose
minister
you
arethe
other
who
is
my
friend
in
gloom
and
isolation
good
heavens
what
are
you
saying
monsieur
dherblay
and
what
is
this
poor
prince
doing
ask
me
rather
what
has
he
done
yes
yes
he
was
brought
up
in
the
country
and
then
thrown
into
a
fortress
which
goes
by
the
name
of
the
bastile
is
it
possible
cried
the
surintendant
clasping
his
hands
the
one
was
the
most
fortunate
of
men
the
other
the
most
unhappy
and
miserable
of
all
living
beings
does
his
mother
not
know
this
anne
of
austria
knows
it
all
and
the
king
knows
absolutely
nothing
so
much
the
better
said
fouquet
this
remark
seemed
to
make
a
great
impression
on
aramis
he
looked
at
fouquet
with
the
most
anxious
expression
of
countenance
i
beg
your
pardon
i
interrupted
you
said
fouquet
i
was
saying
resumed
aramis
that
this
poor
prince
was
the
unhappiest
of
human
beings
when
heaven
whose
thoughts
are
over
all
his
creatures
undertook
to
come
to
his
assistance
oh
in
what
way
tell
me
you
will
see
the
reigning
kingi
say
the
reigning
kingyou
can
guess
very
well
why
no
why
because
both
of
them
being
legitimate
princes
ought
to
have
been
kings
is
not
that
your
opinion
it
is
certainly
unreservedly
most
unreservedly
twins
are
one
person
in
two
bodies
i
am
pleased
that
a
legist
of
your
learning
and
authority
should
have
pronounced
such
an
opinion
it
is
agreed
then
that
each
of
them
possessed
equal
rights
is
it
not
incontestably
but
gracious
heavens
what
an
extraordinary
circumstance
we
are
not
at
the
end
of
it
yetpatience
oh
i
shall
find
patience
enough
heaven
wished
to
raise
up
for
that
oppressed
child
an
avenger
or
a
supporter
or
vindicator
if
you
prefer
it
it
happened
that
the
reigning
king
the
usurperyou
are
quite
of
my
opinion
i
believe
that
it
is
an
act
of
usurpation
quietly
to
enjoy
and
selfishly
to
assume
the
right
over
an
inheritance
to
which
a
man
has
only
half
a
right
yes
usurpation
is
the
word
in
that
case
i
continue
it
was
heavens
will
that
the
usurper
should
possess
in
the
person
of
his
first
minister
a
man
of
great
talent
of
large
and
generous
nature
well
well
said
fouquet
i
understand
you
you
have
relied
upon
me
to
repair
the
wrong
which
has
been
done
to
this
unhappy
brother
of
louis
xiv
you
have
thought
well
i
will
help
you
i
thank
you
dherblay
i
thank
you
oh
no
it
is
not
that
at
all
you
have
not
allowed
me
to
finish
said
aramis
perfectly
unmoved
i
will
not
say
another
word
then
m
fouquet
i
was
observing
the
minister
of
the
reigning
sovereign
was
suddenly
taken
into
the
greatest
aversion
and
menaced
with
the
ruin
of
his
fortune
loss
of
liberty
loss
of
life
even
by
intrigue
and
personal
hatred
to
which
the
king
gave
too
readily
an
attentive
ear
but
heaven
permits
still
however
out
of
consideration
for
the
unhappy
prince
who
had
been
sacrificed
that
m
fouquet
should
in
his
turn
have
a
devoted
friend
who
knew
this
state
secret
and
felt
that
he
possessed
strength
and
courage
enough
to
divulge
this
secret
after
having
had
the
strength
to
carry
it
locked
up
in
his
own
heart
for
twenty
years
go
no
farther
said
fouquet
full
of
generous
feelings
i
understand
you
and
can
guess
everything
now
you
went
to
see
the
king
when
the
intelligence
of
my
arrest
reached
you
you
implored
him
he
refused
to
listen
to
you
then
you
threatened
him
with
that
secret
threatened
to
reveal
it
and
louis
xiv
alarmed
at
the
risk
of
its
betrayal
granted
to
the
terror
of
your
indiscretion
what
he
refused
to
your
generous
intercession
i
understand
i
understand
you
have
the
king
in
your
power
i
understand
you
understand
nothingas
yet
replied
aramis
and
again
you
interrupt
me
then
too
allow
me
to
observe
that
you
pay
no
attention
to
logical
reasoning
and
seem
to
forget
what
you
ought
most
to
remember
what
do
you
mean
you
know
upon
what
i
laid
the
greatest
stress
at
the
beginning
of
our
conversation
yes
his
majestys
hate
invincible
hate
for
me
yes
but
what
feeling
of
hate
could
resist
the
threat
of
such
a
revelation
such
a
revelation
do
you
say
that
is
the
very
point
where
your
logic
fails
you
what
do
you
suppose
that
if
i
had
made
such
a
revelation
to
the
king
i
should
have
been
alive
now
it
is
not
ten
minutes
ago
that
you
were
with
the
king
that
may
be
he
might
not
have
had
the
time
to
get
me
killed
outright
but
he
would
have
had
the
time
to
get
me
gagged
and
thrown
in
a
dungeon
come
come
show
a
little
consistency
in
your
reasoning
mordieu
and
by
the
mere
use
of
this
word
which
was
so
thoroughly
his
old
musketeers
expression
forgotten
by
one
who
never
seemed
to
forget
anything
fouquet
could
not
but
understand
to
what
a
pitch
of
exaltation
the
calm
impenetrable
bishop
of
vannes
had
wrought
himself
he
shuddered
and
then
replied
the
latter
after
having
mastered
his
feelings
should
i
be
the
man
i
really
am
should
i
be
the
true
friend
you
believe
me
if
i
were
to
expose
you
whom
the
king
already
hates
so
bitterly
to
a
feeling
more
than
ever
to
be
dreaded
in
that
young
man
to
have
robbed
him
is
nothing
to
have
addressed
the
woman
he
loves
is
not
much
but
to
hold
in
your
keeping
both
his
crown
and
his
honor
why
he
would
pluck
out
your
heart
with
his
own
hands
you
have
not
allowed
him
to
penetrate
your
secret
then
i
would
sooner
far
sooner
have
swallowed
at
one
draught
all
the
poisons
that
mithridates
drank
in
twenty
years
in
order
to
try
and
avoid
death
than
have
betrayed
my
secret
to
the
king
what
have
you
done
then
ah
now
we
are
coming
to
the
point
monseigneur
i
think
i
shall
not
fail
to
excite
in
you
a
little
interest
you
are
listening
i
hope
how
can
you
ask
me
if
i
am
listening
go
on
aramis
walked
softly
all
round
the
room
satisfied
himself
that
they
were
alone
and
that
all
was
silent
and
then
returned
and
placed
himself
close
to
the
armchair
in
which
fouquet
was
seated
awaiting
with
the
deepest
anxiety
the
revelation
he
had
to
make
i
forgot
to
tell
you
resumed
aramis
addressing
himself
to
fouquet
who
listened
to
him
with
the
most
absorbed
attentioni
forgot
to
mention
a
most
remarkable
circumstance
respecting
these
twins
namely
that
god
had
formed
them
so
startlingly
so
miraculously
like
each
other
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
their
own
mother
would
not
be
able
to
distinguish
them
is
it
possible
exclaimed
fouquet
the
same
noble
character
in
their
features
the
same
carriage
the
same
stature
the
same
voice
but
their
thoughts
degree
of
intelligence
their
knowledge
of
human
life
there
is
inequality
there
i
admit
monseigneur
yes
for
the
prisoner
of
the
bastile
is
most
incontestably
superior
in
every
way
to
his
brother
and
if
from
his
prison
this
unhappy
victim
were
to
pass
to
the
throne
france
would
not
from
the
earliest
period
of
its
history
perhaps
have
had
a
master
more
powerful
in
genius
and
nobility
of
character
fouquet
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
as
if
he
were
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
this
immense
secret
aramis
approached
him
there
is
a
further
inequality
he
said
continuing
his
work
of
temptation
an
inequality
which
concerns
yourself
monseigneur
between
the
twins
both
sons
of
louis
xiii
namely
the
last
comer

not
know
m

fouquet
raised
his
head
immediatelyhis
features
were
pale
and
distorted
the
bolt

hit
its
marknot
his

his
mind
and
comprehension
i
understand
you
he
said
to
aramis
you
are
proposing
a
conspiracy
to
me
something
like
it
one
of
those
attempts
which
as
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
conversation
alters
the
fate
of
empires
and
of
superintendents
too
yes
monseigneur
in
a
word
you
propose
that
i
should
agree
to
the
substitution
of
the
son
of
louis
xiii
who
is
now
a
prisoner
in
the
bastile
for
the
son
of
louis
xiii
who
is
at
this
moment
asleep
in
the
chamber
of
morpheus
aramis
smiled
with
the
sinister
expression
of
the
sinister
thought
which
was
passing
through
his
brain
exactly
he
said
have
you
thought
continued
fouquet
becoming
animated
with
that
strength
of
talent
which
in
a
few
seconds
originates
and
matures
the
conception
of
a
plan
and
with
that
largeness
of
view
which
foresees
all
consequences
and
embraces
every
result
at
a
glancehave
you
thought
that
we
must
assemble
the
nobility
the
clergy
and
the
third
estate
of
the
realm
that
we
shall
have
to
depose
the
reigning
sovereign
to
disturb
by
so
frightful
a
scandal
the
tomb
of
their
dead
father
to
sacrifice
the
life
the
honor
of
a
woman
anne
of
austria
the
life
and
peace
of
mind
and
heart
of
another
woman
maria
theresa
and
suppose
that
it
were
all
done
if
we
were
to
succeed
in
doing
it
i
do
not
understand
you
continued
aramis
coldly
there
is
not
a
single
syllable
of
sense
in
all
you
have
just
said
what
said
the
superintendent
surprised
a
man
like
you
refuse
to
view
the
practical
bearing
of
the
case
do
you
confine
yourself
to
the
childish
delight
of
a
political
illusion
and
neglect
the
chances
of
its
being
carried
into
execution
in
other
words
the
reality
itself
is
it
possible
my
friend
said
aramis
emphasizing
the
word
with
a
kind
of
disdainful
familiarity
what
does
heaven
do
in
order
to
substitute
one
king
for
another
heaven
exclaimed
fouquetheaven
gives
directions
to
its
agent
who
seizes
upon
the
doomed
victim
hurries
him
away
and
seats
the
triumphant
rival
on
the
empty
throne
but
you
forget
that
this
agent
is
called
death
oh
monsieur
dherblay
in
heavens
name
tell
me
if
you
have
had
the
idea
there
is
no
question
of
that
monseigneur
you
are
going
beyond
the
object
in
view
who
spoke
of
louis
xivs
death
who
spoke
of
adopting
the
example
which
heaven
sets
in
following
out
the
strict
execution
of
its
decrees
no
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
heaven
effects
its
purposes
without
confusion
or
disturbance
without
exciting
comment
or
remark
without
difficulty
or
exertion
and
that
men
inspired
by
heaven
succeed
like
heaven
itself
in
all
their
undertakings
in
all
they
attempt
in
all
they
do
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
my
friend
returned
aramis
with
the
same
intonation
on
the
word
friend
that
he
had
applied
to
it
the
first
timei
mean
that
if
there
has
been
any
confusion
scandal
and
even
effort
in
the
substitution
of
the
prisoner
for
the
king
i
defy
you
to
prove
it
what
cried
fouquet
whiter
than
the
handkerchief
with
which
he
wiped
his
temples
what
do
you
say
go
to
the
kings
apartment
continued
aramis
tranquilly
and
you
who
know
the
mystery
i
defy
even
you
to
perceive
that
the
prisoner
of
the
bastile
is
lying
in
his
brothers
bed
but
the
king
stammered
fouquet
seized
with
horror
at
the
intelligence
what
king
said
aramis
in
his
gentlest
tone
the
one
who
hates
you
or
the
one
who
likes
you
the
kingofyesterday
the
king
of
yesterday
be
quite
easy
on
that
score
he
has
gone
to
take
the
place
in
the
bastile
which
his
victim
occupied
for
so
many
years
great
god
and
who
took
him
there
i
you
yes
and
in
the
simplest
way
i
carried
him
away
last
night
while
he
was
descending
into
midnight
the
other
was
ascending
into
day
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
any
disturbance
whatever
a
flash
of
lightning
without
thunder
awakens
nobody
fouquet
uttered
a
thick
smothered
cry
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
some
invisible
blow
and
clasping
his
head
between
his
clenched
hands
he
murmured
you
did
that
cleverly
enough
too
what
do
you
think
of
it
you
dethroned
the
king
imprisoned
him
too
yes
that
has
been
done
and
such
an
action
was
committed
here
at
vaux
yes
here
at
vaux
in
the
chamber
of
morpheus
it
would
almost
seem
that
it
had
been
built
in
anticipation
of
such
an
act
and
at
what
time
did
it
occur
last
night
between
twelve
and
one
oclock
fouquet
made
a
movement
as
if
he
were
on
the
point
of
springing
upon
aramis
he
restrained
himself
at
vaux
under
my
roof
he
said
in
a
halfstrangled
voice
i
believe
so
for
it
is
still
your
house
and
it
is
likely
to
continue
so
since
m
colbert
cannot
rob
you
of
it
now
it
was
under
my
roof
then
monsieur
that
you
committed
this
crime
this
crime
said
aramis
stupefied
this
abominable
crime
pursued
fouquet
becoming
more
and
more
excited
this
crime
more
execrable
than
an
assassination
this
crime
which
dishonors
my
name
forever
and
entails
upon
me
the
horror
of
posterity
you
are
not
in
your
senses
monsieur
replied
aramis
in
an
irresolute
tone
of
voice
you
are
speaking
too
loudly
take
care
i
will
call
out
so
loudly
that
the
whole
world
shall
hear
me
monsieur
fouquet
take
care
fouquet
turned
round
towards
the
prelate
whom
he
looked
at
full
in
the
face
you
have
dishonored
me
he
said
in
committing
so
foul
an
act
of
treason
so
heinous
a
crime
upon
my
guest
upon
one
who
was
peacefully
reposing
beneath
my
roof
oh
woe
woe
is
me
woe
to
the
man
rather
who
beneath
your
roof
meditated
the
ruin
of
your
fortune
your
life
do
you
forget
that
he
was
my
guest
my
sovereign
aramis
rose
his
eyes
literally
bloodshot
his
mouth
trembling
convulsively
have
i
a
man
out
of
his
senses
to
deal
with
he
said
you
have
an
honorable
man
to
deal
with
you
are
mad
a
man
who
will
prevent
you
consummating
your
crime
you
are
mad
i
say
a
man
who
would
sooner
oh
far
sooner
die
who
would
kill
you
even
rather
than
allow
you
to
complete
his
dishonor
and
fouquet
snatched
up
his
sword
which
dartagnan
had
placed
at
the
head
of
his
bed
and
clenched
it
resolutely
in
his
hand
aramis
frowned
and
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast
as
if
in
search
of
a
weapon
this
movement
did
not
escape
fouquet
who
full
of
nobleness
and
pride
in
his
magnanimity
threw
his
sword
to
a
distance
from
him
and
approached
aramis
so
close
as
to
touch
his
shoulder
with
his
disarmed
hand
monsieur
he
said
i
would
sooner
die
here
on
the
spot
than
survive
this
terrible
disgrace
and
if
you
have
any
pity
left
for
me
i
entreat
you
to
take
my
life
aramis
remained
silent
and
motionless
you
do
not
reply
said
fouquet
aramis
raised
his
head
gently
and
a
glimmer
of
hope
might
be
seen
once
more
to
animate
his
eyes
reflect
monseigneur
he
said
upon
everything
we
have
to
expect
as
the
matter
now
stands
the
king
is
still
alive
and
his
imprisonment
saves
your
life
yes
replied
fouquet
you
may
have
been
acting
on
my
behalf
but
i
will
not
do
not
accept
your
services
but
first
of
all
i
do
not
wish
your
ruin
you
will
leave
this
house
aramis
stifled
the
exclamation
which
almost
escaped
his
broken
heart
i
am
hospitable
towards
all
who
are
dwellers
beneath
my
roof
continued
fouquet
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
majesty
you
will
not
be
more
fatally
lost
than
he
whose
ruin
you
have
consummated
you
will
be
so
said
aramis
in
a
hoarse
prophetic
voice
you
will
be
so
believe
me
i
accept
the
augury
monsieur
dherblay
but
nothing
shall
prevent
me
nothing
shall
stop
me
you
will
leave
vauxyou
must
leave
france
i
give
you
four
hours
to
place
yourself
out
of
the
kings
reach
four
hours
said
aramis
scornfully
and
incredulously
upon
the
word
of
fouquet
no
one
shall
follow
you
before
the
expiration
of
that
time
you
will
therefore
have
four
hours
advance
of
those
whom
the
king
may
wish
to
dispatch
after
you
four
hours
repeated
aramis
in
a
thick
smothered
voice
it
is
more
than
you
will
need
to
get
on
board
a
vessel
and
flee
to
belleisle
which
i
give
you
as
a
place
of
refuge
ah
murmured
aramis
belleisle
is
as
much
mine
for
you
as
vaux
is
mine
for
the
king
go
dherblay
go
as
long
as
i
live
not
a
hair
of
your
head
shall
be
injured
thank
you
said
aramis
with
a
cold
irony
of
manner
go
at
once
then
and
give
me
your
hand
before
we
both
hasten
away
you
to
save
your
life
i
to
save
my
honor
aramis
withdrew
from
his
breast
the
hand
he
had
concealed
there
it
was
stained
with
his
blood
he
had
dug
his
nails
into
his
flesh
as
if
in
punishment
for
having
nursed
so
many
projects
more
vain
insensate
and
fleeting
than
the
life
of
the
man
himself
fouquet
was
horrorstricken
and
then
his
heart
smote
him
with
pity
he
threw
open
his
arms
as
if
to
embrace
him
i
had
no
arms
murmured
aramis
as
wild
and
terrible
in
his
wrath
as
the
shade
of
dido
and
then
without
touching
fouquets
hand
he
turned
his
head
aside
and
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
his
last
word
was
an
imprecation
his
last
gesture
a
curse
which
his
bloodstained
hand
seemed
to
invoke
as
it
sprinkled
on
fouquets
face
a
few
drops
of
blood
which
flowed
from
his
breast
and
both
of
them
darted
out
of
the
room
by
the
secret
staircase
which
led
down
to
the
inner
courtyard
fouquet
ordered
his
best
horses
while
aramis
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
which
led
to
porthoss
apartment
he
reflected
profoundly
and
for
some
time
while
fouquets
carriage
left
the
courtyard
at
full
gallop
shall
i
go
alone
said
aramis
to
himself
or
warn
the
prince
oh
fury

the
prince

thendo
what

war
implacable

impossible
what

i

he
seems
like
one

would
be

as

porthos
shall
leave
with
me
and
shall
follow
my

it
must
be
so
and
aramis
apprehensive
of
meeting
any
one
to
whom
his
hurried
movements
might
appear
suspicious
ascended
the
staircase
without
being
perceived
porthos
so
recently
returned
from
paris
was
already
in
a
profound
sleep
his
huge
body
forgot
its
fatigue
as
his
mind
forgot
its
thoughts
aramis
entered
light
as
a
shadow
and
placed
his
nervous
grasp
on
the
giants
shoulder
come
porthos
he
cried
come
porthos
obeyed
rose
from
his
bed
opened
his
eyes
even
before
his
intelligence
seemed
to
be
aroused
we
leave
immediately
said
aramis
ah
returned
porthos
we
shall
go
mounted
and
faster
than
we
have
ever
gone
in
our
lives
ah
repeated
porthos
dress
yourself
my
friend
and
he
helped
the
giant
to
dress
himself
and
thrust
his
gold
and
diamonds
into
his
pocket
whilst
he
was
thus
engaged
a
slight
noise
attracted
his
attention
and
on
looking
up
he
saw
dartagnan
watching
them
through
the
halfopened
door
aramis
started
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
there
in
such
an
agitated
manner
said
the
musketeer
hush
said
porthos
we
are
going
off
on
a
mission
of
great
importance
added
the
bishop
you
are
very
fortunate
said
the
musketeer
oh
dear
me
said
porthos
i
feel
so
wearied
i
would
far
sooner
have
been
fast
asleep
but
the
service
of
the
king
have
you
seen
m
fouquet
said
aramis
to
dartagnan
yes
this
very
minute
in
a
carriage
what
did
he
say
to
you
adieu
nothing
more
was
that
all
what
else
do
you
think
he
could
say
am
i
worth
anything
now
since
you
have
got
into
such
high
favor
listen
said
aramis
embracing
the
musketeer
your
good
times
are
returning
again
you
will
have
no
occasion
to
be
jealous
of
any
one
ah
bah
i
predict
that
something
will
happen
to
you
today
which
will
increase
your
importance
more
than
ever
really
you
know
that
i
know
all
the
news
oh
yes
come
porthos
are
you
ready
let
us
go
i
am
quite
ready
aramis
let
us
embrace
dartagnan
first
most
certainly
but
the
horses
oh
there
is
no
want
of
them
here
will
you
have
mine
no
porthos
has
his
own
stud
so
adieu
adieu
the
fugitives
mounted
their
horses
beneath
the
very
eyes
of
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
who
held
porthoss
stirrup
for
him
and
gazed
after
them
until
they
were
out
of
sight
on
any
other
occasion
thought
the
gascon
i
should
say
that
those
gentlemen
were
making
their
escape
but
in
these
days
politics
seem
so
changed
that
such
an
exit
is
termed
going
on
a
mission
i
have
no
objection
let
me
attend
to
my
own
affairs
that
is
more
than
enough
for
meand
he
philosophically
entered
his
apartments
chapter
xxii
showing
how
the
countersign
was
respected
at
the
bastile
fouquet
tore
along
as
fast
as
his
horses
could
drag
him
on
his
way
he
trembled
with
horror
at
the
idea
of
what
had
just
been
revealed
to
him
what
must
have
been
he
thought
the
youth
of
those
extraordinary
men
who
even
as
age
is
stealing
fast
upon
them
are
still
able
to
conceive
such
gigantic
plans
and
carry
them
through
without
a
tremor
at
one
moment
he
could
not
resist
the
idea
that
all
aramis
had
just
been
recounting
to
him
was
nothing
more
than
a
dream
and
whether
the
fable
itself
was
not
the
snare
so
that
when
fouquet
arrived
at
the
bastile
he
might
possibly
find
an
order
of
arrest
which
would
send
him
to
join
the
dethroned
king
strongly
impressed
with
this
idea
he
gave
certain
sealed
orders
on
his
route
while
fresh
horses
were
being
harnessed
to
his
carriage
these
orders
were
addressed
to
m
dartagnan
and
to
certain
others
whose
fidelity
to
the
king
was
far
above
suspicion
in
this
way
said
fouquet
to
himself
prisoner
or
not
i
shall
have
performed
the
duty
that
i
owe
my
honor
the
orders
will
not
reach
them
until
after
my
return
if
i
should
return
free
and
consequently
they
will
not
have
been
unsealed
i
shall
take
them
back
again
if
i
am
delayed
it
will
be
because
some
misfortune
will
have
befallen
me
and
in
that
case
assistance
will
be
sent
for
me
as
well
as
for
the
king
prepared
in
this
manner
the
superintendent
arrived
at
the
bastile
he
had
traveled
at
the
rate
of
five
leagues
and
a
half
the
hour
every
circumstance
of
delay
which
aramis
had
escaped
in
his
visit
to
the
bastile
befell
fouquet
it
was
useless
giving
his
name
equally
useless
his
being
recognized
he
could
not
succeed
in
obtaining
an
entrance
by
dint
of
entreaties
threats
commands
he
succeeded
in
inducing
a
sentinel
to
speak
to
one
of
the
subalterns
who
went
and
told
the
major
as
for
the
governor
they
did
not
even
dare
disturb
him
fouquet
sat
in
his
carriage
at
the
outer
gate
of
the
fortress
chafing
with
rage
and
impatience
awaiting
the
return
of
the
officers
who
at
last
reappeared
with
a
sufficiently
sulky
air
well
said
fouquet
impatiently
what
did
the
major
say
well
monsieur
replied
the
soldier
the
major
laughed
in
my
face
he
told
me
that
m
fouquet
was
at
vaux
and
that
even
were
he
at
paris
m
fouquet
would
not
get
up
at
so
early
an
hour
as
the
present
mordieu
you
are
an
absolute
set
of
fools
cried
the
minister
darting
out
of
the
carriage
and
before
the
subaltern
had
time
to
shut
the
gate
fouquet
sprang
through
it
and
ran
forward
in
spite
of
the
soldier
who
cried
out
for
assistance
fouquet
gained
ground
regardless
of
the
cries
of
the
man
who
however
having
at
last
come
up
with
fouquet
called
out
to
the
sentinel
of
the
second
gate
look
out
look
out
sentinel
the
man
crossed
his
pike
before
the
minister
but
the
latter
robust
and
active
and
hurried
away
too
by
his
passion
wrested
the
pike
from
the
soldier
and
struck
him
a
violent
blow
on
the
shoulder
with
it
the
subaltern
who
approached
too
closely
received
a
share
of
the
blows
as
well
both
of
them
uttered
loud
and
furious
cries
at
the
sound
of
which
the
whole
of
the
first
body
of
the
advanced
guard
poured
out
of
the
guardhouse
among
them
there
was
one
however
who
recognized
the
superintendent
and
who
called
monseigneur
ah
monseigneur
stop
stop
you
fellows
and
he
effectually
checked
the
soldiers
who
were
on
the
point
of
revenging
their
companions
fouquet
desired
them
to
open
the
gate
but
they
refused
to
do
so
without
the
countersign
he
desired
them
to
inform
the
governor
of
his
presence
but
the
latter
had
already
heard
the
disturbance
at
the
gate
he
ran
forward
followed
by
his
major
and
accompanied
by
a
picket
of
twenty
men
persuaded
that
an
attack
was
being
made
on
the
bastile
baisemeaux
also
recognized
fouquet
immediately
and
dropped
the
sword
he
bravely
had
been
brandishing
ah
monseigneur
he
stammered
how
can
i
excuse
monsieur
said
the
superintendent
flushed
with
anger
and
heated
by
his
exertions
i
congratulate
you
your
watch
and
ward
are
admirably
kept
baisemeaux
turned
pale
thinking
that
this
remark
was
made
ironically
and
portended
a
furious
burst
of
anger
but
fouquet
had
recovered
his
breath
and
beckoning
the
sentinel
and
the
subaltern
who
were
rubbing
their
shoulders
towards
him
he
said
there
are
twenty
pistoles
for
the
sentinel
and
fifty
for
the
officer
pray
receive
my
compliments
gentlemen
i
will
not
fail
to
speak
to
his
majesty
about
you
and
now
m
baisemeaux
a
word
with
you
and
he
followed
the
governor
to
his
official
residence
accompanied
by
a
murmur
of
general
satisfaction
baisemeaux
was
already
trembling
with
shame
and
uneasiness
aramiss
early
visit
from
that
moment
seemed
to
possess
consequences
which
a
functionary
such
as
he
baisemeaux
was
was
perfectly
justified
in
apprehending
it
was
quite
another
thing
however
when
fouquet
in
a
sharp
tone
of
voice
and
with
an
imperious
look
said
you
have
seen
m
dherblay
this
morning
yes
monseigneur
and
are
you
not
horrified
at
the
crime
of
which
you
have
made
yourself
an
accomplice
well
thought
baisemeaux
good
so
far
and
then
he
added
aloud
but
what
crime
monseigneur
do
you
allude
to
that
for
which
you
can
be
quartered
alive
monsieurdo
not
forget
that
but
this
is
not
a
time
to
show
anger
conduct
me
immediately
to
the
prisoner
to
what
prisoner
said
baisemeaux
trembling
you
pretend
to
be
ignorant
very
goodit
is
the
best
plan
for
you
perhaps
for
if
in
fact
you
were
to
admit
your
participation
in
such
a
crime
it
would
be
all
over
with
you
i
wish
therefore
to
seem
to
believe
in
your
assumption
of
ignorance
i
entreat
you
monseigneur
that
will
do
lead
me
to
the
prisoner
to
marchiali
who
is
marchiali
the
prisoner
who
was
brought
back
this
morning
by
m
dherblay
he
is
called
marchiali
said
the
superintendent
his
conviction
somewhat
shaken
by
baisemeauxs
cool
manner
yes
monseigneur
that
is
the
name
under
which
he
was
inscribed
here
fouquet
looked
steadily
at
baisemeaux
as
if
he
would
read
his
very
heart
and
perceived
with
that
clearsightedness
most
men
possess
who
are
accustomed
to
the
exercise
of
power
that
the
man
was
speaking
with
perfect
sincerity
besides
in
observing
his
face
for
a
few
moments
he
could
not
believe
that
aramis
would
have
chosen
such
a
confidant
it
is
the
prisoner
said
the
superintendent
to
him
whom
m
dherblay
carried
away
the
day
before
yesterday
yes
monseigneur
and
whom
he
brought
back
this
morning
added
fouquet
quickly
for
he
understood
immediately
the
mechanism
of
aramiss
plan
precisely
monseigneur
and
his
name
is
marchiali
you
say
yes
marchiali
if
monseigneur
has
come
here
to
remove
him
so
much
the
better
for
i
was
going
to
write
about
him
what
has
he
done
then
ever
since
this
morning
he
has
annoyed
me
extremely
he
has
had
such
terrible
fits
of
passion
as
almost
to
make
me
believe
that
he
would
bring
the
bastile
itself
down
about
our
ears
i
will
soon
relieve
you
of
his
possession
said
fouquet
ah
so
much
the
better
conduct
me
to
his
prison
will
monseigneur
give
me
the
order
what
order
an
order
from
the
king
wait
until
i
sign
you
one
that
will
not
be
sufficient
monseigneur
i
must
have
an
order
from
the
king
fouquet
assumed
an
irritated
expression
as
you
are
so
scrupulous
he
said
with
regard
to
allowing
prisoners
to
leave
show
me
the
order
by
which
this
one
was
set
at
liberty
baisemeaux
showed
him
the
order
to
release
seldon
very
good
said
fouquet
but
seldon
is
not
marchiali
but
marchiali
is
not
at
liberty
monseigneur
he
is
here
but
you
said
that
m
dherblay
carried
him
away
and
brought
him
back
again
i
did
not
say
so
so
surely
did
you
say
it
that
i
almost
seem
to
hear
it
now
it
was
a
slip
of
my
tongue
then
monseigneur
take
care
m
baisemeaux
take
care
i
have
nothing
to
fear
monseigneur
i
am
acting
according
to
the
very
strictest
regulation
do
you
dare
to
say
so
i
would
say
so
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
apostles
m
dherblay
brought
me
an
order
to
set
seldon
at
liberty
seldon
is
free
i
tell
you
that
marchiali
has
left
the
bastile
you
must
prove
that
monseigneur
let
me
see
him
you
monseigneur
who
govern
this
kingdom
know
very
well
that
no
one
can
see
any
of
the
prisoners
without
an
express
order
from
the
king
m
dherblay
has
entered
however
that
remains
to
be
proved
monseigneur
m
de
baisemeaux
once
more
i
warn
you
to
pay
particular
attention
to
what
you
are
saying
all
the
documents
are
there
monseigneur
m
dherblay
is
overthrown
overthrownm
dherblay
impossible
you
see
that
he
has
undoubtedly
influenced
you
no
monseigneur
what
does
in
fact
influence
me
is
the
kings
service
i
am
doing
my
duty
give
me
an
order
from
him
and
you
shall
enter
stay
m
le
gouverneur
i
give
you
my
word
that
if
you
allow
me
to
see
the
prisoner
i
will
give
you
an
order
from
the
king
at
once
give
it
to
me
now
monseigneur
and
that
if
you
refuse
me
i
will
have
you
and
all
your
officers
arrested
on
the
spot
before
you
commit
such
an
act
of
violence
monseigneur
you
will
reflect
said
baisemeaux
who
had
turned
very
pale
that
we
will
only
obey
an
order

he
added
in
a
sonorous
voice
drawing
the
unhappy
governor
towards
him
do
you
know
why
i
am
so
anxious
to
speak
to
the

no
monseigneur
and
allow
me
to
observe
that
you
are
terrifying
me
out
of
my
senses
i
am
trembling
all
overin
fact
i
feel
as
though
i
were
about
to
faint
you
will
stand
a
better
chance
of
fainting
outright
monsieur

at
the

of
ten
thousand
men
and
thirty
pieces
of
cannon
good
heavens
monseigneur
you
are
losing
your
senses
when
i
have
roused
the
whole
population
of
paris
against
you
and
your
accursed
towers
and
have
battered
open
the
gates
of
this
place
and
hanged
you
to
the
topmost
tree
of
yonder
pinnacle
monseigneur
monseigneur
for
pitys
sake
i
give
you
ten
minutes
to
make
up
your
mind
added
fouquet
in
a
calm
voice
i
will
sit
down
here
in
this
armchair
and
wait
for
you
if
in
ten
minutes
time
you
still
persist
i
leave
this
place
and
you
may
think
me
as
mad
as
you
like
thenyou
shall
see
baisemeaux
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
like
a
man
in
a
state
of
despair
but
he
did
not
reply
a
single
syllable
whereupon
fouquet
seized
a
pen
and
ink
and
wrote
order
for
m
le
prevot

assemble
the
municipal
guard
and
to
march

shrugged
his
shoulders
fouquet
wrote

for

monseigneur
cried
baisemeaux
i
do
not
understand
a
single
jot
of
the
whole
matter
but
so
many
misfortunes
even
were
it
madness
itself
that
had
set
them
at
their
awful
work
might
happen
here
in
a
couple
of
hours
that
the
king
by
whom
i
must
be
judged
will
see
whether
i
have
been
wrong
in
withdrawing
the
countersign
before
this
flood
of
imminent
catastrophes
come
with
me
to
the
keep
monseigneur
you
shall
see
marchiali
fouquet
darted
out
of
the
room
followed
by
baisemeaux
as
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
what
a
terrible
morning
he
said
what
a
disgrace
for
me
walk
faster
replied
fouquet
baisemeaux
made
a
sign
to
the
jailer
to
precede
them
he
was
afraid
of
his
companion
which
the
latter
could
not
fail
to
perceive
a
truce
to
this
childs
play
he
said
roughly
let
the
man
remain
here
take
the
keys
yourself
and
show
me
the
way
not
a
single
person
do
you
understand
must
hear
what
is
going
to
take
place
here
ah
said
baisemeaux
undecided
again
cried
m
fouquet
ah
say
no
at
once
and
i
will
leave
the
bastile
and
will
myself
carry
my
own
dispatches
baisemeaux
bowed
his
head
took
the
keys
and
unaccompanied
except
by
the
minister
ascended
the
staircase
the
higher
they
advanced
up
the
spiral
staircase
the
more
clearly
did
certain
muffled
murmurs
become
distinct
appeals
and
fearful
imprecations
what
is
that
asked
fouquet
that
is
your
marchiali
said
the
governor
this
is
the
way
these
madmen
scream
and
he
accompanied
that
reply
with
a
glance
more
pregnant
with
injurious
allusion
as
far
as
fouquet
was
concerned
than
politeness
the
latter
trembled
he
had
just
recognized
in
one
cry
more
terrible
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
the
kings
voice
he
paused
on
the
staircase
snatching
the
bunch
of
keys
from
baisemeaux
who
thought
this
new
madman
was
going
to
dash
out
his
brains
with
one
of
them
ah
he
cried
m
dherblay
did
not
say
a
word
about
that
give
me
the
keys
at
once
cried
fouquet
tearing
them
from
his
hand
which
is
the
key
of
the
door
i
am
to
open
that
one
a
fearful
cry
followed
by
a
violent
blow
against
the
door
made
the
whole
staircase
resound
with
the
echo
leave
this
place
said
fouquet
to
baisemeaux
in
a
threatening
tone
i
ask
nothing
better
murmured
the
latter
to
himself
there
will
be
a
couple
of
madmen
face
to
face
and
the
one
will
kill
the
other
i
am
sure
go
repeated
fouquet
if
you
place
your
foot
on
this
staircase
before
i
call
you
remember
that
you
shall
take
the
place
of
the
meanest
prisoner
in
the
bastile
this
job
will
kill
me
i
am
sure
it
will
muttered
baisemeaux
as
he
withdrew
with
tottering
steps
the
prisoners
cries
became
more
and
more
terrible
when
fouquet
had
satisfied
himself
that
baisemeaux
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
he
inserted
the
key
in
the
first
lock
it
was
then
that
he
heard
the
hoarse
choking
voice
of
the
king
crying
out
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
help
help
i
am
the
king
the
key
of
the
second
door
was
not
the
same
as
the
first
and
fouquet
was
obliged
to
look
for
it
on
the
bunch
the
king
however
furious
and
almost
mad
with
rage
and
passion
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
was
m
fouquet
who
brought
me
here
help
me
against
m
fouquet
i
am
the
king
help
the
king
against
m
fouquet
these
cries
filled
the
ministers
heart
with
terrible
emotions
they
were
followed
by
a
shower
of
blows
leveled
against
the
door
with
a
part
of
the
broken
chair
with
which
the
king
had
armed
himself
fouquet
at
last
succeeded
in
finding
the
key
the
king
was
almost
exhausted
he
could
hardly
articulate
distinctly
as
he
shouted
death
to
fouquet
death
to
the
traitor

were
on
the
point
of
darting
towards
each
other
when
they
suddenly
and
abruptly
stopped
as
a
mutual
recognition
took
place
and
each
uttered
a
cry
of
horror

said
the
king
when
he
recognized
fouquet
the
king
in
this
state
murmured
the
minister
nothing
could
be
more
terrible
indeed
than
the
appearance
of
the
young
prince
at
the
moment
fouquet
had
surprised
him
his
clothes
were
in
tatters
his
shirt
open
and
torn
to
rags
was
stained
with
sweat
and
with
the
blood
which
streamed
from
his
lacerated
breast
and
arms
haggard

his

louis

presented
the
most
perfect
picture
of
despair
distress
anger
and
fear
combined
that
could
possibly
be
united
in
one
figure
fouquet
was
so
touched
so
affected
and
disturbed
by
it
that
he
ran
towards
him
with
his
arms
stretched
out
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
louis
held
up
the
massive
piece
of
wood
of
which
he
had
made
such
a
furious
use
sire
said
fouquet
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
do
you
not
recognize
the
most
faithful
of
your
friends

friendyou
repeated
louis
gnashing
his
teeth
in
a
manner
which
betrayed
his
hate
and
desire
for
speedy
vengeance
the
most
respectful
of
your
servants
added
fouquet
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
the
king
let
the
rude
weapon
fall
from
his
grasp
fouquet
approached
him
kissed
his
knees
and
took
him
in
his
arms
with
inconceivable
tenderness
my
king
my
child
he
said
how
you
must
have
suffered
louis
recalled
to
himself
by
the
change
of
situation
looked
at
himself
and
ashamed
of
the
disordered
state
of
his
apparel
ashamed
of
his
conduct
and
ashamed
of
the
air
of
pity
and
protection
that
was
shown
towards
him
drew
back
fouquet
did
not
understand
this
movement
he
did
not
perceive
that
the
kings
feeling
of
pride
would
never
forgive
him
for
having
been
a
witness
of
such
an
exhibition
of
weakness
come
sire
he
said
you
are
free
free
repeated
the
king
oh
you
set
me
at
liberty
then
after
having
dared
to
lift
up
your
hand
against
me
you
do
not
believe
that
exclaimed
fouquet
indignantly
you
cannot
believe
me
to
be
guilty
of
such
an
act
and
rapidly
warmly
even
he
related
the
whole
particulars
of
the
intrigue
the
details
of
which
are
already
known
to
the
reader
while
the
recital
continued
louis
suffered
the
most
horrible
anguish
of
mind
and
when
it
was
finished
the
magnitude
of
the
danger
he
had
run
struck
him
far
more
than
the
importance
of
the
secret
relative
to
his
twin
brother
monsieur
he
said
suddenly
to
fouquet
this
double
birth
is
a
falsehood
it
is
impossibleyou
cannot
have
been
the
dupe
of
it
sire
it
is
impossible
i
tell
you
that
the
honor
the
virtue
of
my
mother
can
be
suspected
and
my
first
minister
has
not
yet
done
justice
on
the
criminals
reflect
sire
before
you
are
hurried
away
by
anger
replied
fouquet
the
birth
of
your

have
only
one

that
is

well
as
myself
there
is
a

i
tell
you
beginning
with
the
governor
of
the
bastile
be
careful

for
this
man
has
been
deceived
as
every
one
else
has
by
the
princes
likeness
to
yourself

absurd
this
marchiali
must
be
singularly
like
your
majesty
to
be
able
to
deceive
every
ones
eye
fouquet
persisted
ridiculous
do
not
say
so
sire
those
who
had
prepared
everything
in
order
to
face
and
deceive
your
ministers
your
mother
your
officers
of
state
the
members
of
your
family
must
be
quite
confident
of
the
resemblance
between
you
but
where
are
these
persons
then
murmured
the
king
at
vaux
at

and
you
suffer
them
to
remain
there
my
most
instant
duty
appeared
to
me
to
be
your

release
i
have
accomplished
that
duty
and
now
whatever
your
majesty
may
command
shall
be
done
i
await
your
orders

reflected
for
a
few
moments
muster
all
the
troops
in

he
said
all
the
necessary
orders
are
given
for
that
purpose
replied
fouquet
you
have
given
orders
exclaimed
the
king
for
that
purpose
yes
sire
your
majesty
will
be
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
men
in
less
than
an
hour
the
only
reply
the
king
made
was
to
take
hold
of
fouquets
hand
with
such
an
expression
of
feeling
that
it
was
very
easy
to
perceive
how
strongly
he
had
until
that
remark
maintained
his
suspicions
of
the
minister
notwithstanding
the
latters
intervention
and
with
these
troops
he
said
we
shall
go
at
once
and
besiege
in
your
house
the
rebels
who
by
this
time
will
have
established
and
intrenched
themselves
therein
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
were
the
case
replied
fouquet
why
because
their
chiefthe
very
soul
of
the
enterprisehaving
been
unmasked
by
me
the
whole
plan
seems
to
me
to
have
miscarried
you
have
unmasked
this
false
prince
also
no
i
have
not
seen
him
whom
have
you
seen
then
the
leader
of
the
enterprise
not
that
unhappy
young
man
the
latter
is
merely
an
instrument

your

he
was
my
friend
sire
replied
fouquet
nobly
an
unfortunate
circumstance
for
you
said
the
king
in
a
less
generous
tone
of
voice
such
friendships
sire
had
nothing
dishonorable
in
them
so
long
as
i
was
ignorant
of
the
crime
you
should
have
foreseen
it

i
am
guilty
i
place
myself
in
your
majestys

ah
monsieur
fouquet
it
was
not
that
i
meant
returned
the
king
sorry
to
have
shown
the
bitterness
of
his
thought
in
such
a
manner
well
i
assure

his
face
i
had
something
like
a
vague
suspicion
that
he
was
the
very
man
but
with
this
chief
of
the
enterprise
there
was
a
man
of
prodigious
strength
the
one
who
menaced
me
with
a
force
almost
herculean
what
is
he
it
must
be
his
friend
the
baron
du
vallon
formerly
one
of
the

the
friend
of
dartagnan
the
friend
of
the
comte

ah
exclaimed
the
king
as
he
paused
at
the
name
of
the
latter
we
must
not
forget
the
connection
that
existed
between
the
conspirators
and

the
most
honorable
man
in
france
be
satisfied
with
those
whom
i
deliver
up
to
you
with
those
whom
you
deliver
up
to
me
you
say
very
good
for
you
will
deliver
up
those
who
are
guilty
to
me
what
does
your
majesty
understand
by
that
inquired
fouquet
i
understand
replied
the
king
that
we
shall
soon
arrive
at
vaux
with
a
large
body
of
troops
that
we
will
lay
violent
hands
upon
that
nest
of
vipers
and
that
not
a
soul
shall
escape
your
majesty
will
put
these
men
to
death
cried
fouquet
to
the
very
meanest
of
them
oh
sire
let
us
understand
one
another
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
king
haughtily
we
no
longer
live
in
times
when
assassination
was
the
only
and
the
last
resource
kings
held
in
reservation
at
extremity
no
heaven
be
praised
i
have
parliaments
who
sit
and
judge
in
my
name
and
i
have
scaffolds
on
which
supreme
authority
is
carried
out
fouquet
turned
pale
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
observing
to
your
majesty
that
any
proceedings
instituted
respecting
these
matters
would
bring
down
the
greatest
scandal
upon
the
dignity
of
the
throne
the
august
name
of
anne
of
austria
must
never
be
allowed
to
pass
the
lips
of
the
people
accompanied
by
a
smile
justice
must
be
done
however
monsieur
good
sire
but
royal
blood
must
not
be
shed
upon
a
scaffold
the
royal
blood
you
believe
that
cried
the
king
with
fury
in
his
voice
stamping
his
foot
on
the
ground
this
double
birth
is
an
invention
and
in
that
invention
particularly
do
i
see
m
dherblays
crime
it
is
the
crime
i
wish
to
punish
rather
than
the
violence
or
the
insult
and
punish
it
with
death
sire
with
death
yes
monsieur
i
have
said
it
sire
said
the
surintendant
with
firmness
as
he
raised
his
head
proudly
your
majesty
will
take
the
life
if
you
please
of
your
brother
philippe
of
france
that
concerns
you
alone
and
you
will
doubtless
consult
the
queenmother
upon
the
subject
whatever
she
may
command
will
be
perfectly
correct
i
do
not
wish
to
mix
myself
up
in
it
not
even
for
the
honor
of
your
crown
but
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
and
i
beg
to
submit
it
to
you
speak
said
the
king
in
no
little
degree
agitated
by
his
ministers
last
words
what
do
you
require
the
pardon
of
m
dherblay
and
of
m
du
vallon
my
assassins
two
rebels
sire
that
is
all
oh
i
understand
then
you
ask
me
to
forgive
your
friends
my
friends
said
fouquet
deeply
wounded
your
friends
certainly
but
the
safety
of
the
state
requires
that
an
exemplary
punishment
should
be
inflicted
on
the
guilty
i
will
not
permit
myself
to
remind
your
majesty
that
i
have
just
restored
you
to
liberty
and
have
saved
your
life
monsieur
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
remind
your
majesty
that
had
m
dherblay
wished
to
carry
out
his
character
of
an
assassin
he
could
very
easily
have
assassinated
your
majesty
this
morning
in
the
forest
of
senart
and
all
would
have
been
over
the
king
started
a
pistolbullet
through
the
head
pursued
fouquet
and
the
disfigured
features
of
louis
xiv
which
no
one
could
have
recognized
would
be
m
dherblays
complete
and
entire
justification
the
king
turned
pale
and
giddy
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
danger
he
had
escaped
if
m
dherblay
continued
fouquet
had
been
an
assassin
he
had
no
occasion
to
inform
me
of
his
plan
in
order
to
succeed
freed
from
the
real
king
it
would
have
been
impossible
in
all
futurity
to
guess
the
false
and
if
the
usurper
had
been
recognized
by
anne
of
austria
he
would
still
have
beenher
son
the
usurper
as
far
as
monsieur
dherblays
conscience
was
concerned
was
still
a
king
of
the
blood
of
louis
xiii
moreover
the
conspirator
in
that
course
would
have
had
security
secrecy
impunity
a
pistolbullet
would
have
procured
him
all
that
for
the
sake
of
heaven
sire
grant
me
his
forgiveness
the
king
instead
of
being
touched
by
the
picture
so
faithfully
drawn
in
all
details
of
aramiss
generosity
felt
himself
most
painfully
and
cruelly
humiliated
his
unconquerable
pride
revolted
at
the
idea
that
a
man
had
held
suspended
at
the
end
of
his
finger
the
thread
of
his
royal
life
every
word
that
fell
from
fouquets
lips
and
which
he
thought
most
efficacious
in
procuring
his
friends
pardon
seemed
to
pour
another
drop
of
poison
into
the
already
ulcerated
heart
of
louis
xiv
nothing
could
bend
or
soften
him
addressing
himself
to
fouquet
he
said
i
really
dont
know
monsieur
why
you
should
solicit
the
pardon
of
these
men
what
good
is
there
in
asking
that
which
can
be
obtained
without
solicitation
i
do
not
understand
you
sire
it
is
not
difficult
either
where
am
i
now
in
the
bastile
sire
yes
in
a
dungeon
i
am
looked
upon
as
a
madman
am
i
not
yes
sire
and
no
one
is
known
here
but
marchiali
certainly
well
change
nothing
in
the
position
of
affairs
let
the
poor
madman
rot
between
the
slimy
walls
of
the
bastile
and
m
dherblay
and
m
du
vallon
will
stand
in
no
need
of
my
forgiveness
their
new
king
will
absolve
them
your
majesty
does
me
a
great
injustice
sire
and
you
are
wrong
replied
fouquet
dryly
i
am
not
child
enough
nor
is
m
dherblay
silly
enough
to
have
omitted
to
make
all
these
reflections
and
if
i
had
wished
to
make
a
new
king
as
you
say
i
had
no
occasion
to
have
come
here
to
force
open
the
gates
and
doors
of
the
bastile
to
free
you
from
this
place
that
would
show
a
want
of
even
common
sense
your
majestys
mind
is
disturbed
by
anger
otherwise
you
would
be
far
from
offending
groundlessly
the
very
one
of
your
servants
who
has
rendered
you
the
most
important
service
of
all
louis
perceived
that
he
had
gone
too
far
that
the
gates
of
the
bastile
were
still
closed
upon
him
whilst
by
degrees
the
floodgates
were
gradually
being
opened
behind
which
the
generoushearted
fouquet
had
restrained
his
anger
i
did
not
say
that
to
humiliate
you
heaven
knows
monsieur
he
replied
only
you
are
addressing
yourself
to
me
in
order
to
obtain
a
pardon
and
i
answer
according
to
my
conscience
and
so
judging
by
my
conscience
the
criminals
we
speak
of
are
not
worthy
of
consideration
or
forgiveness
fouquet
was
silent
what
i
do
is
as
generous
added
the
king
as
what
you
have
done
for
i
am
in
your
power
i
will
even
say
it
is
more
generous
inasmuch
as
you
place
before
me
certain
conditions
upon
which
my
liberty
my
life
may
depend
and
to
reject
which
is
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
both
i
was
wrong
certainly
replied
fouquet
yesi
had
the
appearance
of
extorting
a
favor
i
regret
it
and
entreat
your
majestys
forgiveness
and
you
are
forgiven
my
dear
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
king
with
a
smile
which
restored
the
serene
expression
of
his
features
which
so
many
circumstances
had
altered
since
the
preceding
evening
i
have
my
own
forgiveness
replied
the
minister
with
some
degree
of
persistence
but
m
dherblay
and
m
du
vallon
they
will
never
obtain
theirs
as
long
as
i
live
replied
the
inflexible
king
do
me
the
kindness
not
to
speak
of
it
again
your
majesty
shall
be
obeyed
and
you
will
bear
me
no
illwill
for
it
oh
no
sire
for
i
anticipated
the
event
you
had
anticipated
that
i
should
refuse
to
forgive
those
gentlemen
certainly
and
all
my
measures
were
taken
in
consequence
what
do
you
mean
to
say
cried
the
king
surprised
m
dherblay
came
as
may
be
said
to
deliver
himself
into
my
hands
m
dherblay
left
to
me
the
happiness
of
saving
my
king
and
my
country
i
could
not
condemn
m
dherblay
to
death
nor
could
i
on
the
other
hand
expose
him
to
your
majestys
justifiable
wrath
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
as
if
i
had
killed
him
myself
well
and
what
have
you
done
sire
i
gave
m
dherblay
the
best
horses
in
my
stables
and
four
hours
start
over
all
those
your
majesty
might
probably
dispatch
after
him
be
it
so
murmured
the
king
but
still
the
world
is
wide
enough
and
large
enough
for
those
whom
i
may
send
to
overtake
your
horses
notwithstanding
the
four
hours
start
which
you
have
given
to
m
dherblay
in
giving
him
these
four
hours
sire
i
knew
i
was
giving
him
his
life
and
he
will
save
his
life
in
what
way
after
having
galloped
as
hard
as
possible
with
the
four
hours
start
before
your
musketeers
he
will
reach
my
chateau
of
belleisle
where
i
have
given
him
a
safe
asylum
that
may
be
but
you
forget
that
you
have
made
me
a
present
of
belleisle
but
not
for
you
to
arrest
my
friends
you
take
it
back
again
then
as
far
as
that
goesyes
sire
my
musketeers
shall
capture
it
and
the
affair
will
be
at
an
end
neither
your
musketeers
nor
your
whole
army
could
take
belleisle
said
fouquet
coldly
belleisle
is
impregnable
the
king
became
perfectly
livid
a
lightning
flash
seemed
to
dart
from
his
eyes
fouquet
felt
that
he
was
lost
but
he
as
not
one
to
shrink
when
the
voice
of
honor
spoke
loudly
within
him
he
bore
the
kings
wrathful
gaze
the
latter
swallowed
his
rage
and
after
a
few
moments
silence
said
are
we
going
to
return
to
vaux
i
am
at
your
majestys
orders
replied
fouquet
with
a
low
bow
but
i
think
that
your
majesty
can
hardly
dispense
with
changing
your
clothes
previous
to
appearing
before
your
court
we
shall
pass
by
the
louvre
said
the
king
come
and
they
left
the
prison
passing
before
baisemeaux
who
looked
completely
bewildered
as
he
saw
marchiali
once
more
leave
and
in
his
helplessness
tore
out
the
major
portion
of
his
few
remaining
hairs
it
was
perfectly
true
however
that
fouquet
wrote
and
gave
him
an
authority
for
the
prisoners
release
and
that
the
king
wrote
beneath
it
seen
and
approved
louis
a
piece
of
madness
that
baisemeaux
incapable
of
putting
two

notwithstanding
the

the

opened

played
the
king
in
such
a
manner
as
to
awaken
no
suspicion
he
was
thus
completely
dressed
in
hunting
costume
when
he
received
his
visitors
his
own
memory
and
the
notes
of
aramis
announced
everybody
to
him
first
of
all
anne
of
austria
to
whom
monsieur
gave
his
hand
and
then
madame
with
m
de
saintaignan
he
smiled
at
seeing
these
countenances
but
trembled
on
recognizing
his
mother
that
still
so
noble
and
imposing
figure
ravaged
by
pain
pleaded
in
his
heart
the
cause
of
the
famous
queen
who
had
immolated
a
child
to
reasons
of
state
he
found
his
mother
still
handsome
he
knew
that
louis
xiv
loved
her
and
he
promised
himself
to
love
her
likewise
and
not
to
prove
a
scourge
to
her
old
age
he
contemplated
his
brother
with
a
tenderness
easily
to
be
understood
the
latter
had
usurped
nothing
had
cast
no
shades
athwart
his
life
a
separate
tree
he
allowed
the
stem
to
rise
without
heeding
its
elevation
or
majestic
life
philippe
promised
himself
to
be
a
kind
brother
to
this
prince
who
required
nothing
but
gold
to
minister
to
his
pleasures
he
bowed
with
a
friendly
air
to
saintaignan
who
was
all
reverences
and
smiles
and
trembling
held
out
his
hand
to
henrietta
his
sisterinlaw
whose
beauty
struck
him
but
he
saw
in
the
eyes
of
that
princess
an
expression
of
coldness
which
would
facilitate
as
he
thought
their
future
relations
how
much
more
easy
thought
he
it
will
be
to
be
the
brother
of
that
woman
than
her
gallant
if
she
evinces
towards
me
a
coldness
that
my
brother
could
not
have
for
her
but
which
is
imposed
upon
me
as
a
duty
the
only
visit
he
dreaded
at
this
moment
was
that
of
the
queen
his
hearthis
mindhad
just
been
shaken
by
so
violent
a
trial
that
in
spite
of
their
firm
temperament
they
would
not
perhaps
support
another
shock
happily
the
queen
did
not
come
then
commenced
on
the
part
of
anne
of
austria
a
political
dissertation
upon
the
welcome
m
fouquet
had
given
to
the
house
of
france
she
mixed
up
hostilities
with
compliments
addressed
to
the
king
and
questions
as
to
his
health
with
little
maternal
flatteries
and
diplomatic
artifices
well
my
son
said
she
are
you
convinced
with
regard
to
m
fouquet
saintaignan
said
philippe
have
the
goodness
to
go
and
inquire
after
the
queen
at
these
words
the
first
philippe
had
pronounced
aloud
the
slight
difference
that
there
was
between
his
voice
and
that
of
the
king
was
sensible
to
maternal
ears
and
anne
of
austria
looked
earnestly
at
her
son
saintaignan
left
the
room
and
philippe
continued
madame
i
do
not
like
to
hear
m
fouquet
illspoken
of
you
know
i
do
notand
you
have
even
spoken
well
of
him
yourself
that
is
true
therefore
i
only
question
you
on
the
state
of
your
sentiments
with
respect
to
him
sire
said
henrietta
i
on
my
part
have
always
liked
m
fouquet
he
is
a
man
of
good
tastea
superior
man
a
superintendent
who
is
never
sordid
or
niggardly
added
monsieur
and
who
pays
in
gold
all
the
orders
i
have
on
him
every
one
in
this
thinks
too
much
of
himself
and
nobody
for
the
state
said
the
old
queen
m
fouquet
it
is
a
fact
m
fouquet
is
ruining
the
state
well
mother
replied
philippe
in
rather
a
lower
key
do
you
likewise
constitute
yourself
the
buckler
of
m
colbert
how
is
that
replied
the
old
queen
rather
surprised
why
in
truth
replied
philippe
you
speak
that
just
as
your
old
friend
madame
de
chevreuse
would
speak
why
do
you
mention
madame
de
chevreuse
to
me
said
she
and
what
sort
of
humor
are
you
in
today
towards
me
philippe
continued
is
not
madame
de
chevreuse
always
in
league
against
somebody
has
not
madame
de
chevreuse
been
to
pay
you
a
visit
mother
monsieur
you
speak
to
me
now
in
such
a
manner
that
i
can
almost
fancy
i
am
listening
to
your
father
my
father
did
not
like
madame
de
chevreuse
and
had
good
reason
for
not
liking
her
said
the
prince
for
my
part
i
like
her
no
better
than
he
did
and
if
she
thinks
proper
to
come
here
as
she
formerly
did
to
sow
divisions
and
hatreds
under
the
pretext
of
begging
moneywhy
well
what
said
anne
of
austria
proudly
herself
provoking
the
storm
well
replied
the
young
man
firmly
i
will
drive
madame
de
chevreuse
out
of
my
kingdomand
with
her
all
who
meddle
with
its
secrets
and
mysteries
he
had
not
calculated
the
effect
of
this
terrible
speech
or
perhaps
he
wished
to
judge
the
effect
of
it
like
those
who
suffering
from
a
chronic
pain
and
seeking
to
break
the
monotony
of
that
suffering
touch
their
wound
to
procure
a
sharper
pang
anne
of
austria
was
nearly
fainting
her
eyes
open
but
meaningless
ceased
to
see
for
several
seconds
she
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
her
other
son
who
supported
and
embraced
her
without
fear
of
irritating
the
king
sire
murmured
she
you
are
treating
your
mother
very
cruelly
in
what
respect
madame
replied
he
i
am
only
speaking
of
madame
de
chevreuse
does
my
mother
prefer
madame
de
chevreuse
to
the
security
of
the
state
and
of
my
person
well
then
madame
i
tell
you
madame
de
chevreuse
has
returned
to
france
to
borrow
money
and
that
she
addressed
herself
to
m
fouquet
to
sell
him
a
certain
secret
a
certain
secret
cried
anne
of
austria
concerning
pretended
robberies
that
monsieur
le
surintendant
had
committed
which
is
false
added
philippe
m
fouquet
rejected
her
offers
with
indignation
preferring
the
esteem
of
the
king
to
complicity
with
such
intriguers
then
madame
de
chevreuse
sold
the
secret
to
m
colbert
and
as
she
is
insatiable
and
was
not
satisfied
with
having
extorted
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
from
a
servant
of
the
state
she
has
taken
a
still
bolder
flight
in
search
of
surer
sources
of
supply
is
that
true
madame
you
know
all
sire
said
the
queen
more
uneasy
than
irritated
now
continued
philippe
i
have
good
reason
to
dislike
this
fury
who
comes
to
my
court
to
plan
the
shame
of
some
and
the
ruin
of
others
if
heaven
has
suffered
certain
crimes
to
be
committed
and
has
concealed
them
in
the
shadow
of
its
clemency
i
will
not
permit
madame
de
chevreuse
to
counteract
the
just
designs
of
fate
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
had
so
agitated
the
queenmother
that
her
son
had
pity
on
her
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
tenderly
she
did
not
feel
that
in
that
kiss
given
in
spite
of
repulsion
and
bitterness
of
the
heart
there
was
a
pardon
for
eight
years
of
suffering
philippe
allowed
the
silence
of
a
moment
to
swallow
the
emotions
that
had
just
developed
themselves
then
with
a
cheerful
smile
we
will
not
go
today
said
he
i
have
a
plan
and
turning
towards
the
door
he
hoped
to
see
aramis
whose
absence
began
to
alarm
him
the
queenmother
wished
to
leave
the
room
remain
where
you
are
mother
said
he
i
wish
you
to
make
your
peace
with
m
fouquet
i
bear
m
fouquet
no
illwill
i
only
dreaded
his
prodigalities
we
will
put
that
to
rights
and
will
take
nothing
of
the
superintendent
but
his
good
qualities
what
is
your
majesty
looking
for
said
henrietta
seeing
the
kings
eyes
constantly
turned
towards
the
door
and
wishing
to
let
fly
a
little
poisoned
arrow
at
his
heart
supposing
he
was
so
anxiously
expecting
either
la
valliere
or
a
letter
from
her
my
sister
said
the
young
man
who
had
divined
her
thought
thanks
to
that
marvelous
perspicuity
of
which
fortune
was
from
that
time
about
to
allow
him
the
exercise
my
sister
i
am
expecting
a
most
distinguished
man
a
most
able
counselor
whom
i
wish
to
present
to
you
all
recommending
him
to
your
good
graces
ah
come
in
then
dartagnan
what
does
your
majesty
wish
said
dartagnan
appearing
where
is
monsieur
the
bishop
of
vannes
your
friend
why
sire
i
am
waiting
for
him
and
he
does
not
come
let
him
be
sought
for
dartagnan
remained
for
an
instant
stupefied
but
soon
reflecting
that
aramis
had
left
vaux
privately
on
a
mission
from
the
king
he
concluded
that
the
king
wished
to
preserve
the
secret
sire
replied
he
does
your
majesty
absolutely
require
m
dherblay
to
be
brought
to
you
absolutely
is
not
the
word
said
philippe
i
do
not
want
him
so
particularly
as
that
but
if
he
can
be
found
i
thought
so
said
dartagnan
to
himself
is
this
m
dherblay
the
bishop
of
vannes
yes
madame
a
friend
of
m
fouquet
yes
madame
an
old
musketeer
anne
of
austria
blushed
one
of
the
four
braves
who
formerly
performed
such
prodigies
the
old
queen
repented
of
having
wished
to
bite
she
broke
off
the
conversation
in
order
to
preserve
the
rest
of
her
teeth
whatever
may
be
your
choice
sire
said
she
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
excellent
all
bowed
in
support
of
that
sentiment
you
will
find
in
him
continued
philippe
the
depth
and
penetration
of
m
de
richelieu
without
the
avarice
of
m
de
mazarin
a
prime
minister
sire
said
monsieur
in
a
fright
i
will
tell
you
all
about
that
brother
but
it
is
strange
that
m
dherblay
is
not
here
he
called
out
let
m
fouquet
be
informed
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
himoh
before
you
before
you
do
not
retire
m
de
saintaignan
returned
bringing
satisfactory
news
of
the
queen
who
only
kept
her
bed
from
precaution
and
to
have
strength
to
carry
out
the
kings
wishes
whilst
everybody
was
seeking
m
fouquet
and
aramis
the
new
king
quietly
continued
his
experiments
and
everybody
family
officers
servants
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
his
identity
his
air
his
voice
and
manners
were
so
like
the
kings
on
his
side
philippe
applying
to
all
countenances
the
accurate
descriptions
and
keynotes
of
character
supplied
by
his
accomplice
aramis
conducted
himself
so
as
not
to
give
birth
to
a
doubt
in
the
minds
of
those
who
surrounded
him
nothing
from
that
time
could
disturb
the
usurper
with
what
strange
facility
had
providence
just
reversed
the
loftiest
fortune
of
the
world
to
substitute
the
lowliest
in
its
stead
philippe
admired
the
goodness
of
god
with
regard
to
himself
and
seconded
it
with
all
the
resources
of
his
admirable
nature
but
he
felt
at
times
something
like
a
specter
gliding
between
him
and
the
rays
of
his
new
glory
aramis
did
not
appear
the
conversation
had
languished
in
the
royal
family
philippe
preoccupied
forgot
to
dismiss
his
brother
and
madame
henrietta
the
latter
were
astonished
and
began
by
degrees
to
lose
all
patience
anne
of
austria
stooped
towards
her
sons
ear
and
addressed
some
words
to
him
in
spanish
philippe
was
completely
ignorant
of
that
language
and
grew
pale
at
this
unexpected
obstacle
but
as
if
the
spirit
of
the
imperturbable
aramis
had
covered
him
with
his
infallibility
instead
of
appearing
disconcerted
philippe
rose
well
what
said
anne
of
austria
what
is
all
that
noise
said
philippe
turning
round
towards
the
door
of
the
second
staircase
and
a
voice
was
heard
saying
this
way
this
way
a
few
steps
more
sire
the
voice
of
m
fouquet
said
dartagnan
who
was
standing
close
to
the
queenmother
then
m
dherblay
cannot
be
far
off
added
philippe
but
he
then
saw
what
he
little
thought
to
have
beheld
so
near
to
him
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
door
at
which
m
fouquet
was
expected
to
enter
but
it
was
not
m
fouquet
who
entered
a
terrible
cry
resounded
from
all
corners
of
the
chamber
a
painful
cry
uttered
by
the
king
and
all
present
it
is
given
to
but
few
men
even
those
whose
destiny
contains
the
strangest
elements
and
accidents
the
most
wonderful
to
contemplate
such
a
spectacle
similar
to
that
which
presented
itself
in
the
royal
chamber
at
that
moment
the
halfclosed
shutters
only
admitted
the
entrance
of
an
uncertain
light
passing
through
thick
violet
velvet
curtains
lined
with
silk
in
this
soft
shade
the
eyes
were
by
degrees
dilated
and
every
one
present
saw
others
rather
with
imagination
than
with
actual
sight
there
could
not
however
escape
in
these
circumstances
one
of
the
surrounding
details
and
the
new
object
which
presented
itself
appeared
as
luminous
as
though
it
shone
out
in
full
sunlight
so
it
happened
with
louis
xiv
when
he
showed
himself
pale
and
frowning
in
the
doorway
of
the
secret
stairs
the
face
of
fouquet
appeared
behind
him
stamped
with
sorrow
and
determination
the
queenmother
who
perceived
louis
xiv
and
who
held
the
hand
of
philippe
uttered
a
cry
of
which
we
have
spoken
as
if
she
beheld
a
phantom
monsieur
was
bewildered
and
kept
turning
his
head
in
astonishment
from
one
to
the
other
madame
made
a
step
forward
thinking
she
was
looking
at
the
form
of
her
brotherinlaw
reflected
in
a
mirror
and
in
fact
the
illusion
was
possible
the
two
princes
both
pale
as
deathfor
we
renounce
the
hope
of
being
able
to
describe
the
fearful
state
of
philippetrembling
clenching
their
hands
convulsively
measured
each
other
with
looks
and
darted
their
glances
sharp
as
poniards
at
each
other
silent
panting
bending
forward
they
appeared
as
if
about
to
spring
upon
an
enemy
the
unheardof
resemblance
of
countenance
gesture
shape
height
even
to
the
resemblance
of
costume
produced
by
chancefor
louis
xiv
had
been
to
the
louvre
and
put
on
a
violetcolored
dressthe
perfect
analogy
of
the
two
princes
completed
the
consternation
of
anne
of
austria
and
yet
she
did
not
at
once
guess
the
truth
there
are
misfortunes
in
life
so
truly
dreadful
that
no
one
will
at
first
accept
them
people
rather
believe
in
the
supernatural
and
the
impossible
louis
had
not
reckoned
on
these
obstacles
he
expected
that
he
had
only
to
appear
to
be
acknowledged
a
living
sun
he
could
not
endure
the
suspicion
of
equality
with
any
one
he
did
not
admit
that
every
torch
should
not
become
darkness
at
the
instant
he
shone
out
with
his
conquering
ray
at
the
aspect
of
philippe
then
he
was
perhaps
more
terrified
than
any
one
round
him
and
his
silence
his
immobility
were
this
time
a
concentration
and
a
calm
which
precede
the
violent
explosions
of
concentrated
passion
but
fouquet
who
shall
paint
his
emotion
and
stupor
in
presence
of
this
living
portrait
of
his
master
fouquet
thought
aramis
was
right
that
this
newlyarrived
was
a
king
as
pure
in
his
race
as
the
other
and
that
for
having
repudiated
all
participation
in
this
coup
detat
so
skillfully
got
up
by
the
general
of
the
jesuits
he
must
be
a
mad
enthusiast
unworthy
of
ever
dipping
his
hands
in
political
grand
strategy
work
and
then
it
was
the
blood
of
louis
xiii
which
fouquet
was
sacrificing
to
the
blood
of
louis
xiii
it
was
to
a
selfish
ambition
he
was
sacrificing
a
noble
ambition
to
the
right
of
keeping
he
sacrificed
the
right
of
having
the
whole
extent
of
his
fault
was
revealed
to
him
at
simple
sight
of
the
pretender
all
that
passed
in
the
mind
of
fouquet
was
lost
upon
the
persons
present
he
had
five
minutes
to
focus
meditation
on
this
point
of
conscience
five
minutes
that
is
to
say
five
ages
during
which
the
two
kings
and
their
family
scarcely
found
energy
to
breathe
after
so
terrible
a
shock
dartagnan
leaning
against
the
wall
in
front
of
fouquet
with
his
hand
to
his
brow
asked
himself
the
cause
of
such
a
wonderful
prodigy
he
could
not
have
said
at
once
why
he
doubted
but
he
knew
assuredly
that
he
had
reason
to
doubt
and
that
in
this
meeting
of
the
two
louis
xivs
lay
all
the
doubt
and
difficulty
that
during
late
days
had
rendered
the
conduct
of
aramis
so
suspicious
to
the
musketeer
these
ideas
were
however
enveloped
in
a
haze
a
veil
of
mystery
the
actors
in
this
assembly
seemed
to
swim
in
the
vapors
of
a
confused
waking
suddenly
louis
xiv
more
impatient
and
more
accustomed
to
command
ran
to
one
of
the
shutters
which
he
opened
tearing
the
curtains
in
his
eagerness
a
flood
of
living
light
entered
the
chamber
and
made
philippe
draw
back
to
the
alcove
louis
seized
upon
this
movement
with
eagerness
and
addressing
himself
to
the
queen
my
mother
said
he
do
you
not
acknowledge
your
son
since
every
one
here
has
forgotten
his
king
anne
of
austria
started
and
raised
her
arms
towards
heaven
without
being
able
to
articulate
a
single
word
my
mother
said
philippe
with
a
calm
voice
do
you
not
acknowledge
your
son
and
this
time
in
his
turn
louis
drew
back
as
to
anne
of
austria
struck
suddenly
in
head
and
heart
with
fell
remorse
she
lost
her
equilibrium
no
one
aiding
her
for
all
were
petrified
she
sank
back
in
her
fauteuil
breathing
a
weak
trembling
sigh
louis
could
not
endure
the
spectacle
and
the
affront
he
bounded
towards
dartagnan
over
whose
brain
a
vertigo
was
stealing
and
who
staggered
as
he
caught
at
the
door
for
support
a
moi
mousquetaire
said
he
look
us
in
the
face
and
say
which
is
the
paler
he
or
i
this
cry
roused
dartagnan
and
stirred
in
his
heart
the
fibers
of
obedience
he
shook
his
head
and
without
more
hesitation
he
walked
straight
up
to
philippe
on
whose
shoulder
he
laid
his
hand
saying
monsieur
you
are
my
prisoner
philippe
did
not
raise
his
eyes
towards
heaven
nor
stir
from
the
spot
where
he
seemed
nailed
to
the
floor
his
eye
intently
fixed
upon
the
king
his
brother
he
reproached
him
with
a
sublime
silence
for
all
misfortunes
past
all
tortures
to
come
against
this
language
of
the
soul
the
king
felt
he
had
no
power
he
cast
down
his
eyes
dragging
away
precipitately
his
brother
and
sister
forgetting
his
mother
sitting
motionless
within
three
paces
of
the
son
whom
she
left
a
second
time
to
be
condemned
to
death
philippe
approached
anne
of
austria
and
said
to
her
in
a
soft
and
nobly
agitated
voice
if
i
were
not
your
son
i
should
curse
you
my
mother
for
having
rendered
me
so
unhappy
dartagnan
felt
a
shudder
pass
through
the
marrow
of
his
bones
he
bowed
respectfully
to
the
young
prince
and
said
as
he
bent
excuse
me
monseigneur
i
am
but
a
soldier
and
my
oaths
are
his
who
has
just
left
the
chamber
thank
you
m
dartagnan
what
has
become
of
m
dherblay
m
dherblay
is
in
safety
monseigneur
said
a
voice
behind
them
and
no
one
while
i
live
and
am
free
shall
cause
a
hair
to
fall
from
his
head
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
prince
smiling
sadly
pardon
me
monseigneur
said
fouquet
kneeling
but
he
who
is
just
gone
out
from
hence
was
my
guest
here
are
murmured
philippe
with
a
sigh
brave
friends
and
good
hearts
they
make
me
regret
the
world
on
m
dartagnan
i
follow
you
at
the
moment
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
was
about
to
leave
the
room
with
his
prisoner
colbert
appeared
and
after
remitting
an
order
from
the
king
to
dartagnan
retired
dartagnan
read
the
paper
and
then
crushed
it
in
his
hand
with
rage
what
is
it
asked
the
prince
read
monseigneur
replied
the
musketeer
philippe
read
the
following
words
hastily
traced
by
the
hand
of
the
king
m
dartagnan
will
conduct
the
prisoner
to
the
ile
saintemarguerite
he
will
cover
his
face
with
an
iron
vizor
which
the
prisoner
shall
never
raise
except
at
peril
of
his
life
that
is
just
said
philippe
with
resignation
i
am
ready
aramis
was
right
said
fouquet
in
a
low
voice
to
the
musketeer
this
one
is
every
whit
as
much
a
king
as
the
other
more
so
replied
dartagnan
he
wanted
only
you
and
me
chapter
xxv
in
which
porthos
thinks
he
is
pursuing
a
duchy
aramis
and
porthos
having
profited
by
the
time
granted
them
by
fouquet
did
honor
to
the
french
cavalry
by
their
speed
porthos
did
not
clearly
understand
on
what
kind
of
mission
he
was
forced
to
display
so
much
velocity
but
as
he
saw
aramis
spurring
on
furiously
he
porthos
spurred
on
in
the
same
way
they
had
soon
in
this
manner
placed
twelve
leagues
between
them
and
vaux
they
were
then
obliged
to
change
horses
and
organize
a
sort
of
post
arrangement
it
was
during
a
relay
that
porthos
ventured
to
interrogate
aramis
discreetly
hush
replied
the
latter
know
only
that
our
fortune
depends
on
our
speed
as
if
porthos
had
still
been
the
musketeer
without
a
sou
or
a
maille
of
1626
he
pushed
forward
that
magic
word
fortune
always
means
something
in
the
human
ear
it
means
enough
for
those
who
have
nothing
it
means
too
much
for
those
who
have
enough
i
shall
be
made
a
duke
said
porthos
aloud
he
was
speaking
to
himself
that
is
possible
replied
aramis
smiling
after
his
own
fashion
as
porthoss
horse
passed
him
aramis
felt
notwithstanding
as
though
his
brain
were
on
fire
the
activity
of
the
body
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
subduing
that
of
the
mind
all
there
is
of
raging
passion
mental
toothache
or
mortal
threat
raged
gnawed
and
grumbled
in
the
thoughts
of
the
unhappy
prelate
his
countenance
exhibited
visible
traces
of
this
rude
combat
free
on
the
highway
to
abandon
himself
to
every
impression
of
the
moment
aramis
did
not
fail
to
swear
at
every
start
of
his
horse
at
every
inequality
in
the
road
pale
at
times
inundated
with
boiling
sweats
then
again
dry
and
icy
he
flogged
his
horses
till
the
blood
streamed
from
their
sides
porthos
whose
dominant
fault
was
not
sensibility
groaned
at
this
thus
traveled
they
on
for
eight
long
hours
and
then
arrived
at
orleans
it
was
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
aramis
on
observing
this
judged
that
nothing
showed
pursuit
to
be
a
possibility
it
would
be
without
example
that
a
troop
capable
of
taking
him
and
porthos
should
be
furnished
with
relays
sufficient
to
perform
forty
leagues
in
eight
hours
thus
admitting
pursuit
which
was
not
at
all
manifest
the
fugitives
were
five
hours
in
advance
of
their
pursuers
aramis
thought
that
there
might
be
no
imprudence
in
taking
a
little
rest
but
that
to
continue
would
make
the
matter
more
certain
twenty
leagues
more
performed
with
the
same
rapidity
twenty
more
leagues
devoured
and
no
one
not
even
dartagnan
could
overtake
the
enemies
of
the
king
aramis
felt
obliged
therefore
to
inflict
upon
porthos
the
pain
of
mounting
on
horseback
again
they
rode
on
till
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
and
had
only
one
post
more
between
them
and
blois
but
here
a
diabolical
accident
alarmed
aramis
greatly
there
were
no
horses
at
the
post
the
prelate
asked
himself
by
what
infernal
machination
his
enemies
had
succeeded
in
depriving
him
of
the
means
of
going
furtherhe
who
never
recognized
chance
as
a
deity
who
found
a
cause
for
every
accident
preferred
believing
that
the
refusal
of
the
postmaster
at
such
an
hour
in
such
a
country
was
the
consequence
of
an
order
emanating
from
above
an
order
given
with
a
view
of
stopping
short
the
kingmaker
in
the
midst
of
his
flight
but
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
fly
into
a
passion
so
as
to
procure
either
a
horse
or
an
explanation
he
was
struck
with
the
recollection
that
the
comte
de
la
fere
lived
in
the
neighborhood
i
am
not
traveling
said
he
i
do
not
want
horses
for
a
whole
stage
find
me
two
horses
to
go
and
pay
a
visit
to
a
nobleman
of
my
acquaintance
who
resides
near
this
place
what
nobleman
asked
the
postmaster
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
oh
replied
the
postmaster
uncovering
with
respect
a
very
worthy
nobleman
but
whatever
may
be
my
desire
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
him
i
cannot
furnish
you
with
horses

indeed
said
aramis
much
disappointed
only
continued
the
postmaster
if
you
will
put
up
with
a
little
carriage
i
have
i
will
harness
an
old
blind
horse
who
has
still
his
legs
left
and
peradventure
will
draw
you
to
the
house
of
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
it
is
worth
a
louis
said
aramis
no
monsieur
such
a
ride
is
worth
no
more
than
a
crown
that
is
what
m
grimaud
the
comtes
intendant
always
pays
me
when
he
makes
use
of
that
carriage
and
i
should
not
wish
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
have
to
reproach
me
with
having
imposed
on
one
of
his
friends
as
you
please
said
aramis
particularly
as
regards
disobliging
the
comte
de
la
fere
only
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
give
you
a
louis
for
your
idea
oh
doubtless
replied
the
postmaster
with
delight
and
he
himself
harnessed
the
ancient
horse
to
the
creaking
carriage
in
the
meantime
porthos
was
curious
to
behold
he
imagined
he
had
discovered
a
clew
to
the
secret
and
he
felt
pleased
because
a
visit
to
athos
in
the
first
place
promised
him
much
satisfaction
and
in
the
next
gave
him
the
hope
of
finding
at
the
same
time
a
good
bed
and
good
supper
the
master
having
got
the
carriage
ready
ordered
one
of
his
men
to
drive
the
strangers
to
la
fere
porthos
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
aramis
whispering
in
his
ear
i
understand
aha
said
aramis
and
what
do
you
understand
my
friend
we
are
going
on
the
part
of
the
king
to
make
some
great
proposal
to
athos
pooh
said
aramis
you
need
tell
me
nothing
about
it
added
the
worthy
porthos
endeavoring
to
reseat
himself
so
as
to
avoid
the
jolting
you
need
tell
me
nothing
i
shall
guess
well
do
my
friend
guess
away
they
arrived
at
athoss
dwelling
about
nine
oclock
in
the
evening
favored
by
a
splendid
moon
this
cheerful
light
rejoiced
porthos
beyond
expression
but
aramis
appeared
annoyed
by
it
in
an
equal
degree
he
could
not
help
showing
something
of
this
to
porthos
who
replieday
ay
i
guess
how
it
is
the
mission
is
a
secret
one
these
were
his
last
words
in
the
carriage
the
driver
interrupted
him
by
saying
gentlemen
we
have
arrived
porthos
and
his
companion
alighted
before
the
gate
of
the
little
chateau
where
we
are
about
to
meet
again
our
old
acquaintances
athos
and
bragelonne
the
latter
of
whom
had
disappeared
since
the
discovery
of
the
infidelity
of
la
valliere
if
there
be
one
saying
truer
than
another
it
is
this
great
griefs
contain
within
themselves
the
germ
of
consolation
this
painful
wound
inflicted
upon
raoul
had
drawn
him
nearer
to
his
father
again
and
god
knows
how
sweet
were
the
consolations
which
flowed
from
the
eloquent
mouth
and
generous
heart
of
athos
the
wound
was
not
cicatrized
but
athos
by
dint
of
conversing
with
his
son
and
mixing
a
little
more
of
his
life
with
that
of
the
young
man
had
brought
him
to
understand
that
this
pang
of
a
first
infidelity
is
necessary
to
every
human
existence
and
that
no
one
has
loved
without
encountering
it
raoul
listened
again
and
again
but
never
understood
nothing
replaces
in
the
deeply
afflicted
heart
the
remembrance
and
thought
of
the
beloved
object
raoul
then
replied
to
the
reasoning
of
his
father
monsieur
all
that
you
tell
me
is
true
i
believe
that
no
one
has
suffered
in
the
affections
of
the
heart
so
much
as
you
have
but
you
are
a
man
too
great
by
reason
of
intelligence
and
too
severely
tried
by
adverse
fortune
not
to
allow
for
the
weakness
of
the
soldier
who
suffers
for
the
first
time
i
am
paying
a
tribute
that
will
not
be
paid
a
second
time
permit
me
to
plunge
myself
so
deeply
in
my
grief
that
i
may
forget
myself
in
it
that
i
may
drown
even
my
reason
in
it
raoul
raoul
listen
monsieur
never
shall
i
accustom
myself
to
the
idea
that
louise
the
chastest
and
most
innocent
of
women
has
been
able
to
so
basely
deceive
a
man
so
honest
and
so
true
a
lover
as
myself
never
can
i
persuade
myself
that
i
see
that
sweet
and
noble
mask
change
into
a
hypocritical
lascivious
face
louise
lost
louise
infamous
ah
monseigneur
that
idea
is
much
more
cruel
to
me
than
raoul
abandonedraoul
unhappy
athos
then
employed
the
heroic
remedy
he
defended
louise
against
raoul
and
justified
her
perfidy
by
her
love
a
woman
who
would
have
yielded
to
a
king
because
he
is
a
king
said
he
would
deserve
to
be
styled
infamous
but
louise
loves
louis
young
both
they
have
forgotten
he
his
rank
she
her
vows
love
absolves
everything
raoul
the
two
young
people
love
each
other
with
sincerity
and
when
he
had
dealt
this
severe
poniardthrust
athos
with
a
sigh
saw
raoul
bound
away
beneath
the
rankling
wound
and
fly
to
the
thickest
recesses
of
the
wood
or
the
solitude
of
his
chamber
whence
an
hour
after
he
would
return
pale
trembling
but
subdued
then
coming
up
to
athos
with
a
smile
he
would
kiss
his
hand
like
the
dog
who
having
been
beaten
caresses
a
respected
master
to
redeem
his
fault
raoul
redeemed
nothing
but
his
weakness
and
only
confessed
his
grief
thus
passed
away
the
days
that
followed
that
scene
in
which
athos
had
so
violently
shaken
the
indomitable
pride
of
the
king
never
when
conversing
with
his
son
did
he
make
any
allusion
to
that
scene
never
did
he
give
him
the
details
of
that
vigorous
lecture
which
might
perhaps
have
consoled
the
young
man
by
showing
him
his
rival
humbled
athos
did
not
wish
that
the
offended
lover
should
forget
the
respect
due
to
his
king
and
when
bragelonne
ardent
angry
and
melancholy
spoke
with
contempt
of
royal
words
of
the
equivocal
faith
which
certain
madmen
draw
from
promises
that
emanate
from
thrones
when
passing
over
two
centuries
with
that
rapidity
of
a
bird
that
traverses
a
narrow
strait
to
go
from
one
continent
to
the
other
raoul
ventured
to
predict
the
time
in
which
kings
would
be
esteemed
as
less
than
other
men
athos
said
to
him
in
his
serene
persuasive
voice
you
are
right
raoul
all
that
you
say
will
happen
kings
will
lose
their
privileges
as
stars
which
have
survived
their
aeons
lose
their
splendor
but
when
that
moment
comes
raoul
we
shall
be
dead
and
remember
well
what
i
say
to
you
in
this
world
all
men
women
and
kings
must
live
for
the
present
we
can
only
live
for
the
future
for
god
this
was
the
manner
in
which
athos
and
raoul
were
as
usual
conversing
and
walking
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
long
alley
of
limes
in
the
park
when
the
bell
which
served
to
announce
to
the
comte
either
the
hour
of
dinner
or
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
was
rung
and
without
attaching
any
importance
to
it
he
turned
towards
the
house
with
his
son
and
at
the
end
of
the
alley
they
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
aramis
and
porthos
chapter
xxvi
the
last
adieux
raoul
uttered
a
cry
and
affectionately
embraced
porthos
aramis
and
athos
embraced
like
old
men
and
this
embrace
itself
being
a
question
for
aramis
he
immediately
said
my
friend
we
have
not
long
to
remain
with
you
ah
said
the
comte
only
time
to
tell
you
of
my
good
fortune
interrupted
porthos
ah
said
raoul
athos
looked
silently
at
aramis
whose
somber
air
had
already
appeared
to
him
very
little
in
harmony
with
the
good
news
porthos
hinted
what
is
the
good
fortune
that
has
happened
to
you
let
us
hear
it
said
raoul
with
a
smile
the
king
has
made
me
a
duke
said
the
worthy
porthos
with
an
air
of
mystery
in
the
ear
of
the
young
man
a
duke
by
brevet
but
the
asides
of
porthos
were
always
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
everybody
his
murmurs
were
in
the
diapason
of
ordinary
roaring
athos
heard
him
and
uttered
an
exclamation
which
made
aramis
start
the
latter
took
athos
by
the
arm
and
after
having
asked
porthoss
permission
to
say
a
word
to
his
friend
in
private
my
dear
athos
he
began
you
see
me
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
trouble
with
grief
and
trouble
my
dear
friend
cried
the
comte
oh
what
in
two
words
i
have
conspired
against
the
king
that
conspiracy
has
failed
and
at
this
moment
i
am
doubtless
pursued
you
are
pursueda
conspiracy
eh
my
friend
what
do
you
tell
me
the
saddest
truth
i
am
entirely
ruined
well
but
porthosthis
title
of
dukewhat
does
all
that
mean
that
is
the
subject
of
my
severest
pain
that
is
the
deepest
of
my
wounds
i
have
believing
in
infallible
success
drawn
porthos
into
my
conspiracy
he
threw
himself
into
it
as
you
know
he
would
do
with
all
his
strength
without
knowing
what
he
was
about
and
now
he
is
as
much
compromised
as
myselfas
completely
ruined
as
i
am
good
god
and
athos
turned
towards
porthos
who
was
smiling
complacently
i
must
make
you
acquainted
with
the
whole
listen
to
me
continued
aramis
and
he
related
the
history
as
we
know
it
athos
during
the
recital
several
times
felt
the
sweat
break
from
his
forehead
it
was
a
great
idea
said
he
but
a
great
error
for
which
i
am
punished
athos
therefore
i
will
not
tell
you
my
entire
thought
tell
it
nevertheless
it
is
a
crime
a
capital
crime
i
know
it
is
lese
majeste
porthos
poor
porthos
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
success
as
i
have
told
you
was
certain
m
fouquet
is
an
honest
man
and
i
a
fool
for
having
so
illjudged
him
said
aramis
oh
the
wisdom
of
man
oh
millstone
that
grinds
the
world
and
which
is
one
day
stopped
by
a
grain
of
sand
which
has
fallen
no
one
knows
how
between
its
wheels
say
by
a
diamond
aramis
but
the
thing
is
done
how
do
you
think
of
acting
i
am
taking
away
porthos
the
king
will
never
believe
that
that
worthy
man
has
acted
innocently
he
never
can
believe
that
porthos
has
thought
he
was
serving
the
king
whilst
acting
as
he
has
done
his
head
would
pay
my
fault
it
shall
not
must
not
be
so
you
are
taking
him
away
whither
to
belleisle
at
first
that
is
an
impregnable
place
of
refuge
then
i
have
the
sea
and
a
vessel
to
pass
over
into
england
where
i
have
many
relations
you
in
england
yes
or
else
in
spain
where
i
have
still
more
but
our
excellent
porthos
you
ruin
him
for
the
king
will
confiscate
all
his
property
all
is
provided
for
i
know
how
when
once
in
spain
to
reconcile
myself
with
louis
xiv
and
restore
porthos
to
favor
you
have
credit
seemingly
aramis
said
athos
with
a
discreet
air
much
and
at
the
service
of
my
friends
these
words
were
accompanied
by
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
thank
you
replied
the
comte
and
while
we
are
on
this
head
said
aramis
you
also
are
a
malcontent
you
also
raoul
have
griefs
to
lay
to
the
king
follow
our
example
pass
over
into
belleisle
then
we
shall
see
i
guarantee
upon
my
honor
that
in
a
month
there
will
be
war
between
france
and
spain
on
the
subject
of
this
son
of
louis
xiii
who
is
an
infante
likewise
and
whom
france
detains
inhumanly
now
as
louis
xiv
would
have
no
inclination
for
a
war
on
that
subject
i
will
answer
for
an
arrangement
the
result
of
which
must
bring
greatness
to
porthos
and
to
me
and
a
duchy
in
france
to
you
who
are
already
a
grandee
of
spain
will
you
join
us
no
for
my
part
i
prefer
having
something
to
reproach
the
king
with
it
is
a
pride
natural
to
my
race
to
pretend
to
a
superiority
over
royal
races
doing
what
you
propose
i
should
become
the
obliged
of
the
king
i
should
certainly
be
the
gainer
on
that
ground
but
i
should
be
a
loser
in
my
conscienceno
thank
you
then
give
me
two
things
athosyour
absolution
oh
i
give
it
you
if
you
really
wished
to
avenge
the
weak
and
oppressed
against
the
oppressor
that
is
sufficient
for
me
said
aramis
with
a
blush
which
was
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
and
now
give
me
your
two
best
horses
to
gain
the
second
post
as
i
have
been
refused
any
under
the
pretext
of
the
duc
de
beaufort
being
traveling
in
this
country
you
shall
have
the
two
best
horses
aramis
and
again
i
recommend
poor
porthos
strongly
to
your
care
oh
i
have
no
fear
on
that
score
one
word
more
do
you
think
i
am
maneuvering
for
him
as
i
ought
the
evil
being
committed
yes
for
the
king
would
not
pardon
him
and
you
have
whatever
may
be
said
always
a
supporter
in
m
fouquet
who
will
not
abandon
you
he
being
himself
compromised
notwithstanding
his
heroic
action
you
are
right
and
that
is
why
instead
of
gaining
the
sea
at
once
which
would
proclaim
my
fear
and
guilt
that
is
why
i
remain
upon
french
ground
but
belleisle
will
be
for
me
whatever
ground
i
wish
it
to
be
english
spanish
or
roman
all
will
depend
with
me
on
the
standard
i
shall
think
proper
to
unfurl
how
so
it
was
i
who
fortified
belleisle
and
so
long
as
i
defend
it
nobody
can
take
belleisle
from
me
and
then
as
you
have
said
just
now
m
fouquet
is
there
belleisle
will
not
be
attacked
without
the
signature
of
m
fouquet
that
is
true
nevertheless
be
prudent
the
king
is
both
cunning
and
strong
aramis
smiled
i
again
recommend
porthos
to
you
repeated
the
count
with
a
sort
of
cold
persistence
whatever
becomes
of
me
count
replied
aramis
in
the
same
tone
our
brother
porthos
will
fare
as
i
door
better
athos
bowed
whilst
pressing
the
hand
of
aramis
and
turned
to
embrace
porthos
with
emotion
i
was
born
lucky
was
i
not
murmured
the
latter
transported
with
happiness
as
he
folded
his
cloak
round
him
come
my
dear
friend
said
aramis
raoul
had
gone
out
to
give
orders
for
the
saddling
of
the
horses
the
group
was
already
divided
athos
saw
his
two
friends
on
the
point
of
departure
and
something
like
a
mist
passed
before
his
eyes
and
weighed
upon
his
heart
it
is
strange
thought
he
whence
comes
the
inclination
i
feel
to
embrace
porthos
once
more
at
that
moment
porthos
turned
round
and
he
came
towards
his
old
friend
with
open
arms
this
last
endearment
was
tender
as
in
youth
as
in
times
when
hearts
were
warmlife
happy
and
then
porthos
mounted
his
horse
aramis
came
back
once
more
to
throw
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
athos
the
latter
watched
them
along
the
highroad
elongated
by
the
shade
in
their
white
cloaks
like
phantoms
they
seemed
to
enlarge
on
their
departure
from
the
earth
and
it
was
not
in
the
mist
but
in
the
declivity
of
the
ground
that
they
disappeared
at
the
end
of
the
perspective
both
seemed
to
have
given
a
spring
with
their
feet
which
made
them
vanish
as
if
evaporated
into
cloudland
then
athos
with
a
very
heavy
heart
returned
towards
the
house
saying
to
bragelonne
raoul
i
dont
know
what
it
is
that
has
just
told
me
that
i
have
seen
those
two
for
the
last
time
it
does
not
astonish
me
monsieur
that
you
should
have
such
a
thought
replied
the
young
man
for
i
have
at
this
moment
the
same
and
think
also
that
i
shall
never
see
messieurs
du
vallon
and
dherblay
again
oh
you
replied
the
count
you
speak
like
a
man
rendered
sad
by
a
different
cause
you
see
everything
in
black
you
are
young
and
if
you
chance
never
to
see
those
old
friends
again
it
will
because
they
no
longer
exist
in
the
world
in
which
you
have
yet
many
years
to
pass
but
i
raoul
shook
his
head
sadly
and
leaned
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
count
without
either
of
them
finding
another
word
in
their
hearts
which
were
ready
to
overflow
all
at
once
a
noise
of
horses
and
voices
from
the
extremity
of
the
road
to
blois
attracted
their
attention
that
way
flambeauxbearers
shook
their
torches
merrily
among
the
trees
of
their
route
and
turned
round
from
time
to
time
to
avoid
distancing
the
horsemen
who
followed
them
these
flames
this
noise
this
dust
of
a
dozen
richly
caparisoned
horses
formed
a
strange
contrast
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
the
melancholy
and
almost
funereal
disappearance
of
the
two
shadows
of
aramis
and
porthos
athos
went
towards
the
house
but
he
had
hardly
reached
the
parterre
when
the
entrance
gate
appeared
in
a
blaze
all
the
flambeaux
stopped
and
appeared
to
enflame
the
road
a
cry
was
heard
of
m
le
duc
de
beaufortand
athos
sprang
towards
the
door
of
his
house
but
the
duke
had
already
alighted
from
his
horse
and
was
looking
around
him
i
am
here
monseigneur
said
athos
ah
good
evening
dear
count
said
the
prince
with
that
frank
cordiality
which
won
him
so
many
hearts
is
it
too
late
for
a
friend
ah
my
dear
prince
come
in
said
the
count
and
m
de
beaufort
leaning
on
the
arm
of
athos
they
entered
the
house
followed
by
raoul
who
walked
respectfully
and
modestly
among
the
officers
of
the
prince
with
several
of
whom
he
was
acquainted
chapter
xxvii
monsieur
de
beaufort
the
prince
turned
round
at
the
moment
when
raoul
in
order
to
leave
him
alone
with
athos
was
shutting
the
door
and
preparing
to
go
with
the
other
officers
into
an
adjoining
apartment
is
that
the
young
man
i
have
heard
m
le
prince
speak
so
highly
of
asked
m
de
beaufort
it
is
monseigneur
he
is
quite
the
soldier
let
him
stay
count
we
cannot
spare
him
remain
raoul
since
monseigneur
permits
it
said
athos
ma
foi
he
is
tall
and
handsome
continued
the
duke
will
you
give
him
to
me
monseigneur
if
i
ask
him
of
you
how
am
i
to
understand
you
monseigneur
said
athos
why
i
call
upon
you
to
bid
you
farewell
farewell
yes
in
good
truth
have
you
no
idea
of
what
i
am
about
to
become
why
i
suppose
what
you
have
always
been
monseigneura
valiant
prince
and
an
excellent
gentleman
i
am
going
to
become
an
african
princea
bedouin
gentleman
the
king
is
sending
me
to
make
conquests
among
the
arabs
what
is
this
you
tell
me
monseigneur
strange
is
it
not
i
the
parisian
par
essence
i
who
have
reigned
in
the
faubourgs
and
have
been
called
king
of
the
hallesi
am
going
to
pass
from
the
place
maubert
to
the
minarets
of
gigelli
from
a
frondeur
i
am
becoming
an
adventurer
oh
monseigneur
if
you
did
not
yourself
tell
me
that
it
would
not
be
credible
would
it
believe
me
nevertheless
and
we
have
but
to
bid
each
other
farewell
this
is
what
comes
of
getting
into
favor
again
into
favor
yes
you
smile
ah
my
dear
count
do
you
know
why
i
have
accepted
this
enterprise
can
you
guess
because
your
highness
loves
glory
aboveeverything
oh
no
there
is
no
glory
in
firing
muskets
at
savages
i
see
no
glory
in
that
for
my
part
and
it
is
more
probable
that
i
shall
there
meet
with
something
else
but
i
have
wished
and
still
wish
earnestly
my
dear
count
that
my
life
should
have
that
last
facet
after
all
the
whimsical
exhibitions
i
have
seen
myself
make
during
fifty
years
for
in
short
you
must
admit
that
it
is
sufficiently
strange
to
be
born
the
grandson
of
a
king
to
have
made
war
against
kings
to
have
been
reckoned
among
the
powers
of
the
age
to
have
maintained
my
rank
to
feel
henry
iv
within
me
to
be
great
admiral
of
franceand
then
to
go
and
get
killed
at
gigelli
among
all
those
turks
saracens
and
moors
monseigneur
you
harp
with
strange
persistence
on
that
theme
said
athos
in
an
agitated
voice
how
can
you
suppose
that
so
brilliant
a
destiny
will
be
extinguished
in
that
remote
and
miserable
scene
and
can
you
believe
upright
and
simple
as
you
are
that
if
i
go
into
africa
for
this
ridiculous
motive
i
will
not
endeavor
to
come
out
of
it
without
ridicule
shall
i
not
give
the
world
cause
to
speak
of
me
and
to
be
spoken
of
nowadays
when
there
are
monsieur
le
prince
m
de
turenne
and
many
others
my
contemporaries
i
admiral
of
france
grandson
of
henry
iv
king
of
paris
have
i
anything
left
but
to
get
myself
killed
cordieu
i
will
be
talked
of
i
tell
you
i
shall
be
killed
whether
or
not
if
not
there
somewhere
else
why
monseigneur
this
is
mere
exaggeration
and
hitherto
you
have
shown
nothing
exaggerated
save
in
bravery
peste
my
dear
friend
there
is
bravery
in
facing
scurvy
dysentery
locusts
poisoned
arrows
as
my
ancestor
st
louis
did
do
you
know
those
fellows
still
use
poisoned
arrows
and
then
you
know
me
of
old
i
fancy
and
you
know
that
when
i
once
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
i
perform
it
in
grim
earnest
yes
you
made
up
your
mind
to
escape
from
vincennes
ay
but
you
aided
me
in
that
my
master
and
a
propos
i
turn
this
way
and
that
without
seeing
my
old
friend
m
vaugrimaud
how
is
he
m
vaugrimaud
is
still
your
highnesss
most
respectful
servant
said
athos
smiling
i
have
a
hundred
pistoles
here
for
him
which
i
bring
as
a
legacy
my
will
is
made
count
ah
monseigneur
monseigneur
and
you
may
understand
that
if
grimauds
name
were
to
appear
in
my
will
the
duke
began
to
laugh
then
addressing
raoul
who
from
the
commencement
of
this
conversation
had
sunk
into
a
profound
reverie
young
man
said
he
i
know
there
is
to
be
found
here
a
certain
de
vouvray
wine
and
i
believe
raoul
left
the
room
precipitately
to
order
the
wine
in
the
meantime
m
de
beaufort
took
the
hand
of
athos
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
him
asked
he
nothing
at
present
monseigneur
ah
yes
i
know
since
the
passion
of
the
king
for
la
valliere
yes
monseigneur
that
is
all
true
then
is
it
i
think
i
know
her
that
little
la
valliere
she
is
not
particularly
handsome
if
i
remember
right
no
monseigneur
said
athos
do
you
know
whom
she
reminds
me
of
does
she
remind
your
highness
of
any
one
she
reminds
me
of
a
very
agreeable
girl
whose
mother
lived
in
the
halles
ah
ah
said
athos
smiling
oh
the
good
old
times
added
m
de
beaufort
yes
la
valliere
reminds
me
of
that
girl
who
had
a
son
had
she
not
3
i
believe
she
had
replied
the
duke
with
careless
naivete
and
a
complaisant
forgetfulness
of
which
no
words
could
translate
the
tone
and
the
vocal
expression
now
here
is
poor
raoul
who
is
your
son
i
believe
yes
he
is
my
son
monseigneur
and
the
poor
lad
has
been
cut
out
by
the
king
and
he
frets
still
better
monseigneur
he
abstains
you
are
going
to
let
the
boy
rust
in
idleness
it
is
a
mistake
come
give
him
to
me
my
wish
is
to
keep
him
at
home
monseigneur
i
have
no
longer
anything
in
the
world
but
him
and
as
long
as
he
likes
to
remain
well
well
replied
the
duke
i
could
nevertheless
have
soon
put
matters
to
rights
again
i
assure
you
i
think
he
has
in
him
the
stuff
of
which
marechals
of
france
are
made
i
have
seen
more
than
one
produced
from
less
likely
rough
material
that
is
very
possible
monseigneur
but
it
is
the
king
who
makes
marechals
of
france
and
raoul
will
never
accept
anything
of
the
king
raoul
interrupted
this
conversation
by
his
return
he
preceded
grimaud
whose
still
steady
hands
carried
the
plateau
with
one
glass
and
a
bottle
of
the
dukes
favorite
wine
on
seeing
his
old
protege
the
duke
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
grimaud
good
evening
grimaud
said
he
how
goes
it
the
servant
bowed
profoundly
as
much
gratified
as
his
noble
interlocutor
two
old
friends
said
the
duke
shaking
honest
grimauds
shoulder
after
a
vigorous
fashion
which
was
followed
by
another
still
more
profound
and
delighted
bow
from
grimaud
but
what
is
this
count
only
one
glass
i
should
not
think
of
drinking
with
your
highness
unless
your
highness
permitted
me
replied
athos
with
noble
humility
cordieu
you
were
right
to
bring
only
one
glass
we
will
both
drink
out
of
it
like
two
brothers
in
arms
begin
count
do
me
the
honor
said
athos
gently
putting
back
the
glass
you
are
a
charming
friend
replied
the
duc
de
beaufort
who
drank
and
passed
the
goblet
to
his
companion
but
that
is
not
all
continued
he
i
am
still
thirsty
and
i
wish
to
do
honor
to
this
handsome
young
man
who
stands
here
i
carry
good
luck
with
me
vicomte
said
he
to
raoul
wish
for
something
while
drinking
out
of
my
glass
and
may
the
black
plague
grab
me
if
what
you
wish
does
not
come
to
pass
he
held
the
goblet
to
raoul
who
hastily
moistened
his
lips
and
replied
with
the
same
promptitude
i
have
wished
for
something
monseigneur
his
eyes
sparkled
with
a
gloomy
fire
and
the
blood
mounted
to
his
cheeks
he
terrified
athos
if
only
with
his
smile
and
what
have
you
wished
for
replied
the
duke
sinking
back
into
his
fauteuil
whilst
with
one
hand
he
returned
the
bottle
to
grimaud
and
with
the
other
gave
him
a
purse
will
you
promise
me
monseigneur
to
grant
me
what
i
wish
for
pardieu
that
is
agreed
upon
i
wished
monsieur
le
duc
to
go
with
you
to
gigelli
athos
became
pale
and
was
unable
to
conceal
his
agitation
the
duke
looked
at
his
friend
as
if
desirous
to
assist
him
to
parry
this
unexpected
blow
that
is
difficult
my
dear
vicomte
very
difficult
added
he
in
a
lower
tone
of
voice
pardon
me
monseigneur
i
have
been
indiscreet
replied
raoul
in
a
firm
voice
but
as
you
yourself
invited
me
to
wish
to
wish
to
leave
me
said
athos
oh
monsieurcan
you
imagine
well
mordieu
cried
the
duke
the
young
vicomte
is
right
what
can
he
do
here
he
will
go
moldy
with
grief
raoul
blushed
and
the
excitable
prince
continued
war
is
a
distraction
we
gain
everything
by
it
we
can
only
lose
one
thing
by
itlifethen
so
much
the
worse
that
is
to
say
memory
said
raoul
eagerly
and
that
is
to
say
so
much
the
better
he
repented
of
having
spoken
so
warmly
when
he
saw
athos
rise
and
open
the
window
which
was
doubtless
to
conceal
his
emotion
raoul
sprang
towards
the
comte
but
the
latter
had
already
overcome
his
emotion
and
turned
to
the
lights
with
a
serene
and
impassible
countenance
well
come
said
the
duke
let
us
see
shall
he
go
or
shall
he
not

he
goes

cried
raoul
bending
his
knee
monseigneur
cried
athos
taking
the
hand
of
the
duke
raoul
shall
do
just
as
he
likes
oh
no
monsieur
just
as
you
like
interrupted
the
young
man
par
la
corbleu
said
the
prince
in
his
turn
it
is
neither
the
comte
nor
the
vicomte
that
shall
have
his
way
it
is
i
i
will
take
him
away
the
marine
offers
a
superb
fortune
my
friend
raoul
smiled
again
so
sadly
that
this
time
athos
felt
his
heart
penetrated
by
it
and
replied
to
him
by
a
severe
look
raoul
comprehended
it
all
he
recovered
his
calmness
and
was
so
guarded
that
not
another
word
escaped
him
the
duke
at
length
rose
on
observing
the
advanced
hour
and
said
with
animation
i
am
in
great
haste
but
if
i
am
told
i
have
lost
time
in
talking
with
a
friend
i
will
reply
i
have
gainedon
the
balancea
most
excellent
recruit
pardon
me
monsieur
le
duc
interrupted
raoul
do
not
tell
the
king
so
for
it
is
not
the
king
i
wish
to
serve
eh
my
friend
whom
then
will
you
serve
the
times
are
past
when
you
might
have
said
i
belong
to
m
de
beaufort
no
nowadays
we
all
belong
to
the
king
great
or
small
therefore
if
you
serve
on
board
my
vessels
there
can
be
nothing
equivocal
about
it
my
dear
vicomte
it
will
be
the
king
you
will
serve
athos
waited
with
a
kind
of
impatient
joy
for
the
reply
about
to
be
made
to
this
embarrassing
question
by
raoul
the
intractable
enemy
of
the
king
his
rival
the
father
hoped
that
the
obstacle
would
overcome
the
desire
he
was
thankful
to
m
de
beaufort
whose
lightness
or
generous
reflection
had
thrown
an
impediment
in
the
way
of
the
departure
of
a
son
now
his
only
joy
but
raoul
still
firm
and
tranquil
replied
monsieur
le
duc
the
objection
you
make
i
have
already
considered
in
my
mind
i
will
serve
on
board
your
vessels
because
you
do
me
the
honor
to
take
me
with
you
but
i
shall
there
serve
a
more
powerful
master
than
the
king
i
shall
serve
god
god
how
so
said
the
duke
and
athos
together
my
intention
is
to
make
profession
and
become
a
knight
of
malta
added
bragelonne
letting
fall
one
by
one
words
more
icy
than
the
drops
which
fall
from
the
bare
trees
after
the
tempests
of
winter
4
under
this
blow
athos
staggered
and
the
prince
himself
was
moved
grimaud
uttered
a
heavy
groan
and
let
fall
the
bottle
which
was
broken
without
anybody
paying
attention
m
de
beaufort
looked
the
young
man
in
the
face
and
read
plainly
though
his
eyes
were
cast
down
the
fire
of
resolution
before
which
everything
must
give
way
as
to
athos
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
that
tender
but
inflexible
soul
he
could
not
hope
to
make
it
deviate
from
the
fatal
road
it
had
just
chosen
he
could
only
press
the
hand
the
duke
held
out
to
him
comte
i
shall
set
off
in
two
days
for
toulon
said
m
de
beaufort
will
you
meet
me
at
paris
in
order
that
i
may
know
your
determination
i
will
have
the
honor
of
thanking
you
there
mon
prince
for
all
your
kindness
replied
the
comte
and
be
sure
to
bring
the
vicomte
with
you
whether
he
follows
me
or
does
not
follow
me
added
the
duke
he
has
my
word
and
i
only
ask
yours
having
thrown
a
little
balm
upon
the
wound
of
the
paternal
heart
he
pulled
the
ear
of
grimaud
whose
eyes
sparkled
more
than
usual
and
regained
his
escort
in
the
parterre
the
horses
rested
and
refreshed
set
off
with
spirit
through
the
lovely
night
and
soon
placed
a
considerable
distance
between
their
master
and
the
chateau
athos
and
bragelonne
were
again
face
to
face
eleven
oclock
was
striking
the
father
and
son
preserved
a
profound
silence
towards
each
other
where
an
intelligent
observer
would
have
expected
cries
and
tears
but
these
two
men
were
of
such
a
nature
that
all
emotion
following
their
final
resolutions
plunged
itself
so
deep
into
their
hearts
that
it
was
lost
forever
they
passed
then
silently
and
almost
breathlessly
the
hour
that
preceded
midnight
the
clock
by
striking
alone
pointed
out
to
them
how
many
minutes
had
lasted
the
painful
journey
made
by
their
souls
in
the
immensity
of
their
remembrances
of
the
past
and
fear
of
the
future
athos
rose
first
saying
it
is
late
then
till
tomorrow
raoul
rose
and
in
his
turn
embraced
his
father
the
latter
held
him
clasped
to
his
breast
and
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
in
two
days
you
will
have
left
me
my
sonleft
me
forever
raoul
monsieur
replied
the
young
man
i
had
formed
a
determination
that
of
piercing
my
heart
with
my
sword
but
you
would
have
thought
that
cowardly
i
have
renounced
that
determination
and
therefore
we
must
part
you
leave
me
desolate
by
going
raoul
listen
to
me
again
monsieur
i
implore
you
if
i
do
not
go
i
shall
die
here
of
grief
and
love
i
know
how
long
a
time
i
have
to
live
thus
send
me
away
quickly
monsieur
or
you
will
see
me
basely
die
before
your
eyesin
your
housethis
is
stronger
than
my
willstronger
than
my
strengthyou
may
plainly
see
that
within
one
month
i
have
lived
thirty
years
and
that
i
approach
the
end
of
my
life
then
said
athos
coldly
you
go
with
the
intention
of
getting
killed
in
africa
oh
tell
me
do
not
lie
raoul
grew
deadly
pale
and
remained
silent
for
two
seconds
which
were
to
his
father
two
hours
of
agony
then
all
at
once
monsieur
said
he
i
have
promised
to
devote
myself
to
god
in
exchange
for
the
sacrifice
i
make
of
my
youth
and
liberty
i
will
only
ask
of
him
one
thing
and
that
is
to
preserve
me
for
you
because
you
are
the
only
tie
which
attaches
me
to
this
world
god
alone
can
give
me
the
strength
not
to
forget
that
i
owe
you
everything
and
that
nothing
ought
to
stand
in
my
esteem
before
you
athos
embraced
his
son
tenderly
and
said
you
have
just
replied
to
me
on
the
word
of
honor
of
an
honest
man
in
two
days
we
shall
be
with
m
de
beaufort
at
paris
and
you
will
then
do
what
will
be
proper
for
you
to
do
you
are
free
raoul
adieu
and
he
slowly
gained
his
bedroom
raoul
went
down
into
the
garden
and
passed
the
night
in
the
alley
of
limes
chapter
xxviii
preparations
for
departure
athos
lost
no
more
time
in
combating
this
immutable
resolution
he
gave
all
his
attention
to
preparing
during
the
two
days
the
duke
had
granted
him
the
proper
appointments
for
raoul
this
labor
chiefly
concerned
grimaud
who
immediately
applied
himself
to
it
with
the
goodwill
and
intelligence
we
know
he
possessed
athos
gave
this
worthy
servant
orders
to
take
the
route
to
paris
when
the
equipments
should
be
ready
and
not
to
expose
himself
to
the
danger
of
keeping
the
duke
waiting
or
delaying
raoul
so
that
the
duke
should
perceive
his
absence
he
himself
the
day
after
the
visit
of
m
de
beaufort
set
off
for
paris
with
his
son
for
the
poor
young
man
it
was
an
emotion
easily
to
be
understood
thus
to
return
to
paris
amongst
all
the
people
who
had
known
and
loved
him
every
face
recalled
a
pang
to
him
who
had
suffered
so
much
to
him
who
had
loved
so
much
some
circumstance
of
his
unhappy
love
raoul
on
approaching
paris
felt
as
if
he
were
dying
once
in
paris
he
really
existed
no
longer
when
he
reached
guiches
residence
he
was
informed
that
guiche
was
with
monsieur
raoul
took
the
road
to
the
luxembourg
and
when
arrived
without
suspecting
that
he
was
going
to
the
place
where
la
valliere
had
lived
he
heard
so
much
music
and
respired
so
many
perfumes
he
heard
so
much
joyous
laughter
and
saw
so
many
dancing
shadows
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
charitable
woman
who
perceived
him
so
dejected
and
pale
beneath
a
doorway
he
would
have
remained
there
a
few
minutes
and
then
would
have
gone
away
never
to
return
but
as
we
have
said
in
the
first
antechamber
he
had
stopped
solely
for
the
sake
of
not
mixing
himself
with
all
those
happy
beings
he
felt
were
moving
around
him
in
the
adjacent
salons
and
as
one
of
monsieurs
servants
recognizing
him
had
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
see
monsieur
or
madame
raoul
had
scarcely
answered
him
but
had
sunk
down
upon
a
bench
near
the
velvet
doorway
looking
at
a
clock
which
had
stopped
for
nearly
an
hour
the
servant
had
passed
on
and
another
better
acquainted
with
him
had
come
up
and
interrogated
raoul
whether
he
should
inform
m
de
guiche
of
his
being
there
this
name
did
not
even
arouse
the
recollections
of
raoul
the
persistent
servant
went
on
to
relate
that
de
guiche
had
just
invented
a
new
game
of
lottery
and
was
teaching
it
to
the
ladies
raoul
opening
his
large
eyes
like
the
absent
man
in
theophrastus
made
no
answer
but
his
sadness
increased
two
shades
with
his
head
hanging
down
his
limbs
relaxed
his
mouth
half
open
for
the
escape
of
his
sighs
raoul
remained
thus
forgotten
in
the
antechamber
when
all
at
once
a
ladys
robe
passed
rubbing
against
the
doors
of
a
side
salon
which
opened
on
the
gallery
a
lady
young
pretty
and
gay
scolding
an
officer
of
the
household
entered
by
that
way
and
expressed
herself
with
much
vivacity
the
officer
replied
in
calm
but
firm
sentences
it
was
rather
a
little
love
pet
than
a
quarrel
of
courtiers
and
was
terminated
by
a
kiss
on
the
fingers
of
the
lady
suddenly
on
perceiving
raoul
the
lady
became
silent
and
pushing
away
the
officer
make
your
escape
malicorne
said
she
i
did
not
think
there
was
any
one
here
i
shall
curse
you
if
they
have
either
heard
or
seen
us
malicorne
hastened
away
the
young
lady
advanced
behind
raoul
and
stretching
her
joyous
face
over
him
as
he
lay
monsieur
is
a
gallant
man
said
she
and
no
doubt
she
here
interrupted
herself
by
uttering
a
cry
raoul
said
she
blushing
mademoiselle
de
montalais
said
raoul
paler
than
death
he
rose
unsteadily
and
tried
to
make
his
way
across
the
slippery
mosaic
of
the
floor
but
she
had
comprehended
that
savage
and
cruel
grief
she
felt
that
in
the
flight
of
raoul
there
was
an
accusation
of
herself
a
woman
ever
vigilant
she
did
not
think
she
ought
to
let
the
opportunity
slip
of
making
good
her
justification
but
raoul
though
stopped
by
her
in
the
middle
of
the
gallery
did
not
seem
disposed
to
surrender
without
a
combat
he
took
it
up
in
a
tone
so
cold
and
embarrassed
that
if
they
had
been
thus
surprised
the
whole
court
would
have
no
doubt
about
the
proceedings
of
mademoiselle
de
montalais
ah
monsieur
said
she
with
disdain
what
you
are
doing
is
very
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
my
heart
inclines
me
to
speak
to
you
you
compromise
me
by
a
reception
almost
uncivil
you
are
wrong
monsieur
and
you
confound
your
friends
with
enemies
farewell
raoul
had
sworn
never
to
speak
of
louise
never
even
to
look
at
those
who
might
have
seen
louise
he
was
going
into
another
world
that
he
might
never
meet
with
anything
louise
had
seen
or
even
touched
but
after
the
first
shock
of
his
pride
after
having
had
a
glimpse
of
montalais
the
companion
of
louisemontalais
who
reminded
him
of
the
turret
of
blois
and
the
joys
of
youthall
his
reason
faded
away
pardon
me
mademoiselle
it
enters
not
it
cannot
enter
into
my
thoughts
to
be
uncivil
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
said
she
with
the
smile
of
former
days
well
come
somewhere
else
for
we
may
be
surprised
oh
said
he
she
looked
at
the
clock
doubtingly
then
having
reflected
in
my
apartment
said
she
we
shall
have
an
hour
to
ourselves
and
taking
her
course
lighter
than
a
fairy
she
ran
up
to
her
chamber
followed
by
raoul
shutting
the
door
and
placing
in
the
hands
of
her
cameriste
the
mantle
she
had
held
upon
her
arm
you
were
seeking
m
de
guiche
were
you
not
said
she
to
raoul
yes
mademoiselle
i
will
go
and
ask
him
to
come
up
here
presently
after
i
have
spoken
to
you
do
so
mademoiselle
are
you
angry
with
me
raoul
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
then
casting
down
his
eyes
yes
said
he
you
think
i
was
concerned
in
the
plot
which
brought
about
the
rupture
do
you
not
rupture
said
he
with
bitterness
oh
mademoiselle
there
can
be
no
rupture
where
there
has
been
no
love
you
are
in
error
replied
montalais
louise
did
love
you
raoul
started
not
with
love
i
know
but
she
liked
you
and
you
ought
to
have
married
her
before
you
set
out
for
london
raoul
broke
into
a
sinister
laugh
which
made
montalais
shudder
you
tell
me
that
very
much
at
your
ease
mademoiselle
do
people
marry
whom
they
like
you
forget
that
the
king
then
kept
for
himself
as
his
mistress
her
of
whom
we
are
speaking
listen
said
the
young
woman
pressing
the
hands
of
raoul
in
her
own
you
were
wrong
in
every
way
a
man
of
your
age
ought
never
to
leave
a
woman
of
hers
alone
there
is
no
longer
any
faith
in
the
world
then
said
raoul
no
vicomte
said
montalais
quietly
nevertheless
let
me
tell
you
that
if
instead
of
loving
louise
coldly
and
philosophically
you
had
endeavored
to
awaken
her
to
love
enough
i
pray
you
mademoiselle
said
raoul
i
feel
as
though
you
are
all
of
both
sexes
of
a
different
age
from
me
you
can
laugh
and
you
can
banter
agreeably
i
mademoiselle
i
loved
mademoiselle
de
raoul
could
not
pronounce
her
namei
loved
her
well
i
put
my
faith
in
hernow
i
am
quits
by
loving
her
no
longer
oh
vicomte
said
montalais
pointing
to
his
reflection
in
a
lookingglass
i
know
what
you
mean
mademoiselle
i
am
much
altered
am
i
not
well
do
you
know
why
because
my
face
is
the
mirror
of
my
heart
the
outer
surface
changed
to
match
the
mind
within
you
are
consoled
then
said
montalais
sharply
no
i
shall
never
be
consoled
i
dont
understand
you
m
de
bragelonne
i
care
but
little
for
that
i
do
not
quite
understand
myself
you
have
not
even
tried
to
speak
to
louise
who
i
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
eyes
flashing
fire
iwhy
do
you
not
advise
me
to
marry
her
perhaps
the
king
would
consent
now
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
full
of
anger
i
see
said
montalais
that
you
are
not
cured
and
that
louise
has
one
enemy
the
more
one
enemy
the
more
yes
favorites
are
but
little
beloved
at
the
court
of
france
oh
while
she
has
her
lover
to
protect
her
is
not
that
enough
she
has
chosen
him
of
such
a
quality
that
her
enemies
cannot
prevail
against
her
but
stopping
all
at
once
and
then
she
has
you
for
a
friend
mademoiselle
added
he
with
a
shade
of
irony
which
did
not
glide
off
the
cuirass
who
ioh
no
i
am
no
longer
one
of
those
whom
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
condescends
to
look
upon
but
this
but
so
big
with
menace
and
with
storm
this
but
which
made
the
heart
of
raoul
beat
such
griefs
did
it
presage
for
her
whom
lately
he
loved
so
dearly
this
terrible
but
so
significant
in
a
woman
like
montalais
was
interrupted
by
a
moderately
loud
noise
heard
by
the
speakers
proceeding
from
the
alcove
behind
the
wainscoting
montalais
turned
to
listen
and
raoul
was
already
rising
when
a
lady
entered
the
room
quietly
by
the
secret
door
which
she
closed
after
her
madame
exclaimed
raoul
on
recognizing
the
sisterinlaw
of
the
king
stupid
wretch
murmured
montalais
throwing
herself
but
too
late
before
the
princess
i
have
been
mistaken
in
an
hour
she
had
however
time
to
warn
the
princess
who
was
walking
towards
raoul
m
de
bragelonne
madame
and
at
these
words
the
princess
drew
back
uttering
a
cry
in
her
turn
your
royal
highness
said
montalais
with
volubility
is
kind
enough
to
think
of
this
lottery
and
the
princess
began
to
lose
countenance
raoul
hastened
his
departure
without
divining
all
but
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
way
madame
was
preparing
a
word
of
transition
to
recover
herself
when
a
closet
opened
in
front
of
the
alcove
and
m
de
guiche
issued
all
radiant
also
from
that
closet
the
palest
of
the
four
we
must
admit
was
still
raoul
the
princess
however
was
near
fainting
and
was
obliged
to
lean
upon
the
foot
of
the
bed
for
support
no
one
ventured
to
support
her
this
scene
occupied
several
minutes
of
terrible
suspense
but
raoul
broke
it
he
went
up
to
the
count
whose
inexpressible
emotion
made
his
knees
tremble
and
taking
his
hand
dear
count
said
he
tell
madame
i
am
too
unhappy
not
to
merit
pardon
tell
her
also
that
i
have
loved
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
that
the
horror
of
the
treachery
that
has
been
practiced
on
me
renders
me
inexorable
towards
all
other
treachery
that
may
be
committed
around
me
this
is
why
mademoiselle
said
he
smiling
to
montalais
i
never
would
divulge
the
secret
of
the
visits
of
my
friend
to
your
apartment
obtain
from
madamefrom
madame
who
is
so
clement
and
so
generousobtain
her
pardon
for
you
whom
she
has
just
surprised
also
you
are
both
free
love
each
other
be
happy
the
princess
felt
for
a
moment
a
despair
that
cannot
be
described
it
was
repugnant
to
her
notwithstanding
the
exquisite
delicacy
which
raoul
had
exhibited
to
feel
herself
at
the
mercy
of
one
who
had
discovered
such
an
indiscretion
it
was
equally
repugnant
to
her
to
accept
the
evasion
offered
by
this
delicate
deception
agitated
nervous
she
struggled
against
the
double
stings
of
these
two
troubles
raoul
comprehended
her
position
and
came
once
more
to
her
aid
bending
his
knee
before
her
madame
said
he
in
a
low
voice
in
two
days
i
shall
be
far
from
paris
in
a
fortnight
i
shall
be
far
from
france
where
i
shall
never
be
seen
again
are
you
going
away
then
said
she
with
great
delight
with
m
de
beaufort
into
africa
cried
de
guiche
in
his
turn
you
raouloh
my
friendinto
africa
where
everybody
dies
and
forgetting
everything
forgetting
that
that
forgetfulness
itself
compromised
the
princess
more
eloquently
than
his
presence
ingrate
said
he
and
you
have
not
even
consulted
me
and
he
embraced
him
during
which
time
montalais
had
led
away
madame
and
disappeared
herself
raoul
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
said
with
a
smile
i
have
been
dreaming
then
warmly
to
guiche
who
by
degrees
absorbed
him
my
friend
said
he
i
conceal
nothing
from
you
who
are
the
elected
of
my
heart
i
am
going
to
seek
death
in
yonder
country
your
secret
will
not
remain
in
my
breast
more
than
a
year
oh
raoul
a
man
do
you
know
what
is
my
thought
count
this
is
iti
shall
live
more
vividly
being
buried
beneath
the
earth
than
i
have
lived
for
this
month
past
we
are
christians
my
friend
and
if
such
sufferings
were
to
continue
i
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
safety
of
my
soul
de
guiche
was
anxious
to
raise
objections
not
one
word
more
on
my
account
said
raoul
but
advice
to
you
dear
friend
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
is
of
much
greater
importance
what
is
that
without
doubt
you
risk
much
more
than
i
do
because
you
love
oh
it
is
a
joy
so
sweet
to
me
to
be
able
to
speak
to
you
thus
well
then
de
guiche
beware
of
montalais
what
of
that
kind
friend
she
was
the
friend
ofher
you
know
of
she
ruined
her
by
pride
you
are
mistaken
and
now
when
she
has
ruined
her
she
would
ravish
from
her
the
only
thing
that
renders
that
woman
excusable
in
my
eyes
what
is
that
her
love
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
there
is
a
plot
formed
against
her
who
is
the
mistress
of
the
kinga
plot
formed
in
the
very
house
of
madame
can
you
think
so
i
am
certain
of
it
by
montalais
take
her
as
the
least
dangerous
of

planchets
inventory
athos
during
the
visit
made
to
the
luxembourg
by
raoul
had
gone
to
planchets
residence
to
inquire
after
dartagnan
the
comte
on
arriving
at
the
rue
des
lombards
found
the
shop
of
the
grocer
in
great
confusion
but
it
was
not
the
encumberment
of
a
lucky
sale
or
that
of
an
arrival
of
goods
planchet
was
not
enthroned
as
usual
on
sacks
and
barrels
no
a
young
man
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
and
another
with
an
accountbook
in
his
hand
were
setting
down
a
number
of
figures
whilst
a
third
counted
and
weighed
an
inventory
was
being
taken
athos
who
had
no
knowledge
of
commercial
matters
felt
himself
a
little
embarrassed
by
material
obstacles
and
the
majesty
of
those
who
were
thus
employed
he
saw
several
customers
sent
away
and
asked
himself
whether
he
who
came
to
buy
nothing
would
not
be
more
properly
deemed
importunate
he
therefore
asked
very
politely
if
he
could
see
m
planchet
the
reply
quite
carelessly
given
was
that
m
planchet
was
packing
his
trunks
these
words
surprised
athos
what
his
trunks
said
he
is
m
planchet
going
away
yes
monsieur
directly
then
if
you
please
inform
him
that
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
desires
to
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
at
the
mention
of
the
comtes
name
one
of
the
young
men
no
doubt
accustomed
to
hear
it
pronounced
with
respect
immediately
went
to
inform
planchet
it
was
at
this
moment
that
raoul
after
his
painful
scene
with
montalais
and
de
guiche
arrived
at
the
grocers
house
planchet
left
his
job
directly
he
received
the
comtes
message
ah
monsieur
le
comte
exclaimed
he
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
what
good
star
brings
you
here
my
dear
planchet
said
athos
pressing
the
hand
of
his
son
whose
sad
look
he
silently
observedwe
are
come
to
learn
of
youbut
in
what
confusion
do
i
find
you
you
are
as
white
as
a
miller
where
have
you
been
rummaging
ah
diable
take
care
monsieur
dont
come
near
me
till
i
have
well
shaken
myself
what
for
flour
or
dust
only
whiten
no
no
what
you
see
on
my
arms
is
arsenic
arsenic
yes
i
am
taking
my
precautions
against
rats
ay
i
suppose
in
an
establishment
like
this
rats
play
a
conspicuous
part
it
is
not
with
this
establishment
i
concern
myself
monsieur
le
comte
the
rats
have
robbed
me
of
more
here
than
they
will
ever
rob
me
of
again
what
do
you
mean
why
you
may
have
observed
monsieur
my
inventory
is
being
taken
are
you
leaving
trade
then
eh
mon
dieu
yes
i
have
disposed
of
my
business
to
one
of
my
young
men
bah
you
are
rich
then
i
suppose
monsieur
i
have
taken
a
dislike
to
the
city
i
dont
know
whether
it
is
because
i
am
growing
old
and
as
m
dartagnan
one
day
said
when
we
grow
old
we
more
often
think
of
the
adventures
of
our
youth
but
for
some
time
past
i
have
felt
myself
attracted
towards
the
country
and
gardening
i
was
a
countryman
formerly
and
planchet
marked
this
confession
with
a
rather
pretentious
laugh
for
a
man
making
profession
of
humility
athos
made
a
gesture
of
approval
and
then
added
you
are
going
to
buy
an
estate
then
i
have
bought
one
monsieur
ah
that
is
still
better
a
little
house
at
fontainebleau
with
something
like
twenty
acres
of
land
round
it
very
well
planchet
accept
my
compliments
on
your
acquisition
but
monsieur
we
are
not
comfortable
here
the
cursed
dust
makes
you
cough
corbleu
i
do
not
wish
to
poison
the
most
worthy
gentleman
in
the
kingdom
athos
did
not
smile
at
this
little
pleasantry
which
planchet
had
aimed
at
him
in
order
to
try
his
strength
in
mundane
facetiousness
yes
said
athos
let
us
have
a
little
talk
by
ourselvesin
your
own
room
for
example
you
have
a
room
have
you
not
certainly
monsieur
le
comte
upstairs
perhaps
and
athos
seeing
planchet
a
little
embarrassed
wished
to
relieve
him
by
going
first
it
isbut
said
planchet
hesitating
athos
was
mistaken
in
the
cause
of
this
hesitation
and
attributing
it
to
a
fear
the
grocer
might
have
of
offering
humble
hospitality
never
mind
never
mind
said
he
still
going
up
the
dwelling
of
a
tradesman
in
this
quarter
is
not
expected
to
be
a
palace
come
on
raoul
nimbly
preceded
him
and
entered
first
two
cries
were
heard
simultaneouslywe
may
say
three
one
of
these
cries
dominated
the
others
it
emanated
from
a
woman
another
proceeded
from
the
mouth
of
raoul
it
was
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
it
than
he
shut
the
door
sharply
the
third
was
from
fright
it
came
from
planchet
i
ask
your
pardon
added
he
madame
is
dressing
raoul
had
no
doubt
seen
that
what
planchet
said
was
true
for
he
turned
round
to
go
downstairs
again
madame
said
athos
oh
pardon
me
planchet
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
upstairs
it
is
truchen
added
planchet
blushing
a
little
it
is
whoever
you
please
my
good
planchet
but
pardon
my
rudeness
no
no
go
up
now
gentlemen
we
will
do
no
such
thing
said
athos
oh
madame
having
notice
has
had
time
no
planchet
farewell
eh
gentlemen
you
would
not
disoblige
me
by
thus
standing
on
the
staircase
or
by
going
away
without
having
sat
down
if
we
had
known
you
had
a
lady
upstairs
replied
athos
with
his
customary
coolness
we
would
have
asked
permission
to
pay
our
respects
to
her
planchet
was
so
disconcerted
by
this
little
extravagance
that
he
forced
the
passage
and
himself
opened
the
door
to
admit
the
comte
and
his
son
truchen
was
quite
dressed
in
the
costume
of
the
shopkeepers
wife
rich
yet
coquettish
german
eyes
attacking
french
eyes
she
left
the
apartment
after
two
courtesies
and
went
down
into
the
shopbut
not
without
having
listened
at
the
door
to
know
what
planchets
gentlemen
visitors
would
say
of
her
athos
suspected
that
and
therefore
turned
the
conversation
accordingly
planchet
on
his
part
was
burning
to
give
explanations
which
athos
avoided
but
as
certain
tenacities
are
stronger
than
others
athos
was
forced
to
hear
planchet
recite
his
idyls
of
felicity
translated
into
a
language
more
chaste
than
that
of
longus
so
planchet
related
how
truchen
had
charmed
the
years
of
his
advancing
age
and
brought
good
luck
to
his
business
as
ruth
did
to
boaz
you
want
nothing
now
then
but
heirs
to
your
property
if
i
had
one
he
would
have
three
hundred
thousand
livres
said
planchet
humph
you
must
have
one
then
said
athos
phlegmatically
if
only
to
prevent
your
little
fortune
being
lost
this
word
little
fortune
placed
planchet
in
his
rank
like
the
voice
of
the
sergeant
when
planchet
was
but
a
piqueur
in
the
regiment
of
piedmont
in
which
rochefort
had
placed
him
athos
perceived
that
the
grocer
would
marry
truchen
and
in
spite
of
fate
establish
a
family
this
appeared
the
more
evident
to
him
when
he
learned
that
the
young
man
to
whom
planchet
was
selling
the
business
was
her
cousin
having
heard
all
that
was
necessary
of
the
happy
prospects
of
the
retiring
grocer
what
is
m
dartagnan
about
said
he
he
is
not
at
the
louvre
ah
monsieur
le
comte
monsieur
dartagnan
has
disappeared
disappeared
said
athos
in
surprise
oh
monsieur
we
know
what
that
means
but
i
do
not
know
whenever
m
dartagnan
disappears
it
is
always
for
some
mission
or
some
great
affair
has
he
said
anything
to
you
about
it
never
you
were
acquainted
with
his
departure
for
england
formerly
were
you
not
on
account
of
the
speculation
said
planchet
heedlessly
the
speculation
i
mean
interrupted
planchet
quite
confused
well
well
neither
your
affairs
nor
those
of
your
master
are
in
question
the
interest
we
take
in
him
alone
has
induced
me
to
apply
to
you
since
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
is
not
here
and
as
we
cannot
learn
from
you
where
we
are
likely
to
find
m
dartagnan
we
will
take
our
leave
of
you
au
revoir
planchet
au
revoir
let
us
be
gone
raoul
monsieur
le
comte
i
wish
i
were
able
to
tell
you
oh
not
at
all
i
am
not
the
man
to
reproach
a
servant
with
discretion
this
word
servant
struck
rudely
on
the
ears
of
the
demimillionnaire
planchet
but
natural
respect
and
bonhomie
prevailed
over
pride
there
is
nothing
indiscreet
in
telling
you
monsieur
le
comte
m
dartagnan
came
here
the
other
day
aha
and
remained
several
hours
consulting
a
geographical
chart
you
are
right
then
my
friend
say
no
more
about
it
and
the
chart
is
there
as
a
proof
added
planchet
who
went
to
fetch
from
the
neighboring
wall
where
it
was
suspended
by
a
twist
forming
a
triangle
with
the
bar
of
the
window
to
which
it
was
fastened
the
plan
consulted
by
the
captain
on
his
last
visit
to
planchet
this
plan
which
he
brought
to
the
comte
was
a
map
of
france
upon
which
the
practiced
eye
of
that
gentleman
discovered
an
itinerary
marked
out
with
small
pins
wherever
a
pin
was
missing
a
hole
denoted
its
having
been
there
athos
by
following
with
his
eye
the
pins
and
holes
saw
that
dartagnan
had
taken
the
direction
of
the
south
and
gone
as
far

never

of
the
pleasure

humiliating
his
royal
majesty
when
they
had
an
opportunity
it
was
this
egotistical

constrained
to

with
its

the

likewise

could
not

out
for

without
a
good
round
sum
and
in

find
that
sum
he
was
distributing

his
old
creditors
plate
arms
jewels

furniture
which
was
more
magnificent
in
selling
it

brought
him
back

a
man
to
whom
ten
thousand
livres
were
owing
refuse
to
carry
away
a
present
worth
six
thousand
enhanced
in
estimation
from
having
belonged
to
a
descendant
of
henry

and
how
after
having
carried
away
that
present
could
he
refuse
ten
thousand
livres
more
to
this
generous
noble
this

an

he
had
no

superfluous
arms

was
placed
amidst
his
cannons
no
more

the
sea
might
rob
him
of

he
had
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
crowns
fresh
in
his
coffers
and
throughout
the
house

was
a

movement

people

monseigneur
the

in

every

gave
up

the
oriental

of

carried

from

paid
themselves
upon

thus
the

plundered
the
clothespresses

very
little

anxious
to

their

given
them
by

many
were

bounding
joyously
along
under

weight
of
earthen
jars
and
bottles
gloriously
stamped
with
the
arms
of

by
giving
away
his

made

utensils
and
thirty
more
with
the
contents
of
his
cellar
still
further
all
these
people
went
away
with
the
conviction
that
m
de
beaufort
only
acted
in
this
manner
to
prepare
for
a
new
fortune
concealed
beneath
the
arabs
tents
they
repeated
to
each
other
while
pillaging
his
hotel
that
he
was
sent
to
gigelli
by
the
king
to
reconstruct
his
lost
fortunes
that
the
treasures
of
africa
would
be
equally
divided
between
the
admiral
and
the
king
of
france
that
these
treasures
consisted
in
mines
of
diamonds
or
other
fabulous
stones
the
gold
and
silver
mines
of

did
not
even
obtain
the
honor
of
being
named
in

to
the
mines
to
be
workedwhich
could
not
be
begun
till
after

campaignthere
would
be
the
booty

by

lay
his
hands
on
all
the
riches
pirates

robbed
christendom
of
since
the
battle
of
lepanto
the
number
of
millions
from
these
sources
defied
calculation
why
then
should
he
who
was
going
in
quest
of
such
treasure
set
any
store
by
the
poor
utensils
of
his
past
life
and
reciprocally
why
should
they
spare
the
property
of
him
who
spared
it
so
little
himself
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
athos
with
his
piercing
practiced
glance
saw
what
was
going
on
at

he
found
the
admiral
of
france
a
little
exalted
for
he
was
rising
from
a
table
of
fifty
covers
at
which
the
guests
had
drunk
long
and
deeply
to
the
prosperity
of
the
expedition
at
the
conclusion
of
which
repast
the
remains
with
the
dessert
had
been
given
to
the
servants

empty
dishes

the
curious
the

was
intoxicated
with
his
ruin
and
his
popularity
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
had
drunk
his
old
wine
to
the
health
of
his
wine
of
the

he
saw

moistened

monseigneur
the

right
to

war

to

among
the
arabs
with
gold
as
well
as
lead
i
wish
to
try
the
contrary
replied
the
duke
and
then
you
are
acquainted
with
my
ideas
upon
the
expeditionplenty
of
noise
plenty
of
fire
and
if
so
it
must
be
i
shall
disappear
in
the
smoke
having
spoken
thus
m
de
beaufort
began
to
laugh
but
his
mirth
was
not
reciprocated
by
athos
and
raoul
he
perceived
this
at
once
ah
said
he
with
the
courteous
egotism
of
his
rank
and
age
you
are
such
people
as
a
man
should
not
see
after
dinner
you
are
cold
stiff
and
dry
when
i
am
all
fire
suppleness
and
wine
no
devil
take
me
i
should
always
see
you
fasting
vicomte
and
you
comte
if
you
wear
such
a
face
as
that
you
shall
see
me
no
more
he
said
this
pressing
the
hand
of
athos
who
replied
with
a
smile
monseigneur
do
not
talk
so
grandly
because
you
happen
to
have
plenty
of
money
i
predict
that
within
a
month
you
will
be
dry
stiff
and
cold
in
presence
of
your
strongbox
and
that
then
having
raoul
at
your
elbow
fasting
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
him
gay
animated
and
generous
because
he
will
have
some
new
crowns
to
offer
you
god
grant
it
may
be
so
cried
the
delighted
duke
comte
stay
with
me
no
i
shall
go
with
raoul
the
mission
with
which
you
charge
him
is
a
troublesome
and
difficult
one
alone
it
would
be
too
much
for
him
to
execute
you
do
not
observe
monseigneur
you
have
given
him
command
of
the
first
order
bah
and
in
your
naval
arrangements
too
that
may
be
true
but
one
finds
that
such
fine
young
fellows
as
your
son
generally
do
all
that
is
required
of
them
monseigneur
i
believe
you
will
find
nowhere
so
much
zeal
and
intelligence
so
much
real
bravery
as
in
raoul
but
if
he
failed
to
arrange
your
embarkation
you
would
only
meet
the
fate
that
you
deserve
humph
you
are
scolding
me
then
monseigneur
to
provision
a
fleet
to
assemble
a
flotilla
to
enroll
your
maritime
force
would
take
an
admiral
a
year
raoul
is
a
cavalry
officer
and
you
allow
him
a
fortnight
i
tell
you
he
will
do
it
he
may
but
i
will
go
and
help
him
to
be
sure
you
will
i
reckoned
upon
you
and
still
further
believe
that
when
we
are
once
at
toulon
you
will
not
let
him
depart
alone
oh
said
athos
shaking

if

going

monsieur
replied
athos
sternly
do
not
be
unjust
and
senseless
in
your
egotism
or
your
grief
whichever
you
please
to
call
it
if
you
set
out
for
this
war
solely
with
the
intention
of
getting
killed
therein
you
stand
in
need
of
nobody
and
it
was
scarcely
worth
while
to
recommend
you
to
m
de
beaufort
but
when
you
have
been
introduced
to
the
prime
commandantwhen
you
have
accepted
the
responsibility
of
a
post
in
his
army
the
question
is
no
longer
about
you
but
about
all
those
poor
soldiers
who
as
well
as
you
have
hearts
and
bodies
who
will
weep
for
their
country
and
endure
all
the
necessities
of
their
condition
remember
raoul
that
officers
are
ministers
as
useful
to
the
world
as
priests
and
that
they
ought
to
have
more
charity
monsieur
i
know
it
and
have
practiced
it
i
would
have
continued
to
do
so
still
but
you
forget
also
that
you
are
of
a
country
that
is
proud
of
its
military
glory
go
and
die
if
you
like
but
do
not
die
without
honor
and
without
advantage
to
france
cheer
up
raoul
do
not
let
my
words

you
i
love
you
and

to
see
you
perfect
i
love
your
reproaches
monsieur
said
the
young
man
mildly
they
alone
may
cure
me
because
they
prove
to
me
that
some
one
loves
me
still
and
now
raoul
let
us
be
off
the
weather
is
so
fine
the
heavens
so
clear
those
heavens
which
we
always
find
above
our
heads
which
you
will
see
more
clear
still
at
gigelli
and
which
will
speak
to
you
of
me
there
as
they
speak
to
me
here
of
god
the
two
gentlemen
after
having
agreed
on
this
point
talked
over
the
wild
freaks
of
the
duke
convinced
that
france
would
be
served
in
a
very
incomplete
manner
as
regarded
both
spirit
and
practice
in
the
ensuing
expedition
and
having
summed
up
the
ducal
policy
under
the
one
word
vanity
they
set
forward
in
obedience
rather
to
their
will
than
destiny
the
sacrifice

accomplished

the

dish
the
journey
passed
off
pretty
well
athos
and
his
son
traversed
france
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
leagues
per
day
sometimes
more
sometimes
less
according
to
the
intensity
of
raouls
grief
it
took
them
a
fortnight
to
reach
toulon
and
they
lost
all
traces
of
dartagnan
at
antibes
they
were
forced
to
believe
that
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
was
desirous
of
preserving
an
incognito
on
his
route
for
athos
derived
from
his
inquiries
an
assurance
that
such
a
cavalier
as
he
described
had
exchanged
his
horse
for
a
wellclosed
carriage
on
quitting
avignon
raoul
was
much
affected
at
not
meeting
with
dartagnan
his
affectionate
heart
longed
to
take
a
farewell
and
received
consolation
from
that
heart
of
steel
athos
knew
from
experience
that
dartagnan
became
impenetrable
when
engaged
in
any
serious
affair
whether
on
his
own
account
or
on
the
service
of
the
king
he
even
feared
to
offend
his
friend
or
thwart
him
by
too
pressing
inquiries
and
yet
when
raoul
commenced
his
labor
of
classing
the
flotilla
and
got
together
the
chalands
and
lighters
to
send
them
to
toulon
one
of
the
fishermen
told
the
comte
that
his
boat
had
been
laid
up
to
refit
since
a
trip
he
had
made
on
account
of
a
gentleman
who
was
in
great
haste
to
embark
athos
believing
that
this
man
was
telling
a
falsehood
in
order
to
be
left
at
liberty
to
fish
and
so
gain
more
money
when
all
his
companions
were
gone
insisted
upon
having
the
details
the
fisherman
informed
him
that
six
days
previously
a
man
had
come
in
the
night
to
hire
his
boat
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
island
of
st
honnorat
the
price
was
agreed
upon
but
the
gentleman
had
arrived
with
an
immense
carriage
case
which
he
insisted
upon
embarking
in
spite
of
the
many
difficulties
that
opposed
the
operation
the
fisherman
wished
to
retract
he
had
even
threatened
but
his
threats
had
procured
him
nothing
but
a
shower
of
blows
from
the
gentlemans
cane
which
fell
upon
his
shoulders
sharp
and
long
swearing
and
grumbling
he
had
recourse
to
the
syndic
of
his
brotherhood
at
antibes
who
administer
justice
among
themselves
and
protect
each
other
but
the
gentleman
had
exhibited
a
certain
paper
at
sight
of
which
the
syndic
bowing
to
the
very
ground
enjoined
obedience
from
the
fisherman
and
abused
him
for
having
been
refractory
they
then
departed
with
the
freight
but
all
this
does
not
tell
us
said
athos
how
you
injured
your
boat
this
is
the
way
i
was
steering
towards
st
honnorat
as
the
gentleman
desired
me
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
pretended
that
i
could
not
pass
to
the
south
of
the
abbey
and
why
not
because
monsieur
there
is
in
front
of
the
square
tower
of
the
benedictines
towards
the
southern
point
the
bank
of
the
moines
a
rock
asked
athos
level
with
the
water
but
below
water
a
dangerous
passage
yet
one
i
have
cleared
a
thousand
times
the
gentleman
required
me
to
land
him
at
saintemarguerites
well
well
monsieur
cried
the
fisherman
with
his
provencal
accent
a
man
is
a
sailor
or
he
is
not
he
knows
his
course
or
he
is
nothing
but
a
freshwater
lubber
i
was
obstinate
and
wished
to
try
the
channel
the
gentleman
took
me
by
the
collar
and
told
me
quietly
he
would
strangle
me
my
mate
armed
himself
with
a
hatchet
and
so
did
i
we
had
the
affront
of
the
night
before
to
pay
him
out
for
but
the
gentleman
drew
his
sword
and
used
it
in
such
an
astonishingly
rapid
manner
that
we
neither
of
us
could
get
near
him
i
was
about
to
hurl
my
hatchet
at
his
head
and
i
had
a
right
to
do
so
hadnt
i
monsieur
for
a
sailor
aboard
is
master
as
a
citizen
is
in
his
chamber
i
was
going
then
in
selfdefense
to
cut
the
gentleman
in
two
when
all
at
oncebelieve
me
or
not
monsieurthe
great
carriage
case
opened
of
itself
i
dont
know
how
and
there
came
out
of
it
a
sort
of
a
phantom
his
head
covered
with
a
black
helmet
and
a
black
mask
something
terrible
to
look
upon
which
came
towards
me
threatening
with
its
fist
and
that
was
said
athos
that
was
the
devil
monsieur
for
the
gentleman
with
great
glee
cried
out
on
seeing
him
ah
thank
you
monseigneur
a
most
strange
story
murmured
the
comte
looking
at
raoul
and
what
did
you
do
asked
the
latter
of
the
fisherman
you
must
know
monsieur
that
two
poor
men
such
as
we
are
could
be
no
match
for
two
gentlemen
but
when
one
of
them
turned
out
to
be
the
devil
we
had
no
earthly
chance
my
companion
and
i
did
not
stop
to
consult
one
another
we
made
but
one
jump
into
the
sea
for
we
were
within
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
of
the
shore
well
and
then
why
and
then
monseigneur
as
there
was
a
little
wind
from
the
southwest
the
boat
drifted
into
the
sands
of
saintemarguerites
ohbut
the
travelers
bah
you
need
not
be
uneasy
about
them
it
was
pretty
plain
that
one
was
the
devil
and
protected
the
other
for
when
we
recovered
the
boat
after
she
got
afloat
again
instead
of
finding
these
two
creatures
injured
by
the
shock
we
found
nothing
not
even
the
carriage
or
the
case
very
strange
very
strange
repeated
the
comte
but
after
that
what
did
you
do
my
friend
i
made
my
complaint
to
the
governor
of
saintemarguerites
who
brought
my
finger
under
my
nose
by
telling
me
if
i
plagued
him
with
such
silly
stories
he
would
have
me
flogged
what
did
the
governor
himself
say
so
yes
monsieur
and
yet
my
boat
was
injured
seriously
injured
for
the
prow
is
left
upon
the
point
of
saintemarguerites
and
the
carpenter
asks
a
hundred
and
twenty
livres
to
repair
it
very
well
replied
raoul
you
will
be
exempted
from
the
service
go
we
will
go
to
saintemarguerites
shall
we
said
the
comte
to
bragelonne
as
the
man
walked
away
yes
monsieur
for
there
is
something
to
be
cleared
up
that
man
does
not
seem
to
me
to
have
told
the
truth
nor
to
me
either
raoul
the
story
of
the
masked
man
and
the
carriage
having
disappeared
may
be
told
to
conceal
some
violence
these
fellows
have
committed
upon
their
passengers
in
the
open
sea
to
punish
him
for
his
persistence
in
embarking
i
formed
the
same
suspicion
the
carriage
was
more
likely
to
contain
property
than
a
man
we
shall
see
to
that
raoul
the
gentleman
very
much
resembles
dartagnan
i
recognize
his
methods
of
proceeding
alas
we
are
no
longer
the
young
invincibles
of
former
days
who
knows
whether
the
hatchet
or
the
iron
bar
of
this
miserable
coaster
has
not
succeeded
in
doing
that
which
the
best
blades
of
europe
balls
and
bullets
have
not
been
able
to
do
in
forty
years
that
same
day
they
set
out
for
saintemarguerites
on
board
a
chassemaree
come
from
toulon
under
orders
the
impression
they
experienced
on
landing
was
a
singularly
pleasing
one
the
island
seemed
loaded
with
flowers
and
fruits
in
its
cultivated
part
it
served
as
a
garden
for
the
governor
orange
pomegranate
and
fig
trees
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
their
golden
or
purple
fruits
all
round
this
garden
in
the
uncultivated
parts
red
partridges
ran
about
in
conveys
among
the
brambles
and
tufts
of
junipers
and
at
every
step
of
the
comte
and
raoul
a
terrified
rabbit
quitted
his
thyme
and
heath
to
scuttle
away
to
the
burrow
in
fact
this
fortunate
isle
was
uninhabited
flat
offering
nothing
but
a
tiny
bay
for
the
convenience
of
embarkation
and
under
the
protection
of
the
governor
who
went
shares
with
them
smugglers
made
use
of
it
as
a
provisional
entrepot
at
the
expense
of
not
killing
the
game
or
devastating
the
garden
with
this
compromise
the
governor
was
in
a
situation
to
be
satisfied
with
a
garrison
of
eight
men
to
guard
his
fortress
in
which
twelve
cannons
accumulated
coats
of
moldy
green
the
governor
was
a
sort
of
happy
farmer
harvesting
wines
figs
oil
and
oranges
preserving
his
citrons
and
cedrates
in
the
sun
of
his
casemates
the
fortress
encircled
by
a
deep
ditch
its
only
guardian
arose
like
three
heads
upon
turrets
connected
with
each
other
by
terraces
covered
with
moss
athos
and
raoul
wandered
for
some
time
round
the
fences
of
the
garden
without
finding
any
one
to
introduce
them
to
the
governor
they
ended
by
making
their
own
way
into
the
garden
it
was
at
the
hottest
time
of
the
day
each
living
thing
sought
its
shelter
under
grass
or
stone
the
heavens
spread
their
fiery
veils
as
if
to
stifle
all
noises
to
envelop
all
existences
the
rabbit
under
the
broom
the
fly
under
the
leaf
slept
as
the
wave
did
beneath
the
heavens
athos
saw
nothing
living
but
a
soldier
upon
the
terrace
beneath
the
second
and
third
court
who
was
carrying
a
basket
of
provisions
on
his
head
this
man
returned
almost
immediately
without
his
basket
and
disappeared
in
the
shade
of
his
sentrybox
athos
supposed
he
must
have
been
carrying
dinner
to
some
one
and
after
having
done
so
returned
to
dine
himself
all
at
once
they
heard
some
one
call
out
and
raising
their
heads
perceived
in
the
frame
of
the
bars
of
the
window
something
of
a
white
color
like
a
hand
that
was
waved
backwards
and
forwardssomething
shining
like
a
polished
weapon
struck
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
before
they
were
able
to
ascertain
what
it
was
a
luminous
train
accompanied
by
a
hissing
sound
in
the
air
called
their
attention
from
the
donjon
to
the
ground
a
second
dull
noise
was
heard
from
the
ditch
and
raoul
ran
to
pick
up
a
silver
plate
which
was
rolling
along
the
dry
sand
the
hand
that
had
thrown
this
plate
made
a
sign
to
the
two
gentlemen
and
then
disappeared
athos
and
raoul
approaching
each
other
commenced
an
attentive
examination
of
the
dusty
plate
and
they
discovered
in
characters
traced
upon
the
bottom
of
it
with
the
point
of
a
knife
this
inscription
i
am
the
brother
of

french
gentlemen
and
christians
pray
to
god
for
the
soul
and
the
reason
of
the
son
of
your
old
rulers
the
plate
fell
from
the
hands
of
athos
whilst
raoul
was
endeavoring
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
these
dismal
words
at
the
same
moment
they
heard
a
cry
from
the
top
of
the
donjon
quick
as
lightning
raoul
bent
down
his
head
and
forced
down
that
of
his
father
likewise
a
musketbarrel
glittered
from
the
crest
of
the
wall
a
white
smoke
floated
like
a
plume
from
the
mouth
of
the
musket
and
a
ball
was
flattened
against
a
stone
within
six
inches
of
the
two
gentlemen
cordieu
cried
athos
what
are
people
assassinated
here
come
down
cowards
as
you
are
yes
come
down
cried
raoul
furiously
shaking
his
fist
at
the
castle
one
of
the
assailantshe
who
was
about
to
firereplied
to
these
cries
by
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
as
his
companion
who
wished
to
continue
the
attack
had
reseized
his
loaded
musket
he
who
had
cried
out
threw
up
the
weapon
and
the
ball
flew
into
the
air
athos
and
raoul
seeing
them
disappear
from
the
platform
expected
they
would
come
down
to
them
and
waited
with
a
firm
demeanor
five
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
a
stroke
upon
a
drum
called
the
eight
soldiers
of
the
garrison
to
arms
and
they
showed
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
with
their
muskets
in
hand
at
the
head
of
these
men
was
an
officer
whom
athos
and
raoul
recognized
as
the
one
who
had
fired
the
first
musket
the
man
ordered
the
soldiers
to
make
ready
we
are
going
to
be
shot
cried
raoul
but
sword
in
hand
at
least
let
us
leap
the
ditch
we
shall
kill
at
least
two
of
these
scoundrels
when
their
muskets
are
empty
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
raoul
was
springing
forward
followed
by
athos
when
a
wellknown
voice
resounded
behind
them
athos
raoul
dartagnan
replied
the
two
gentlemen
recover
arms
mordioux
cried
the
captain
to
the
soldiers
i
was
sure
i
could
not
be
mistaken
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
asked
athos
what
were
we
to
be
shot
without
warning
it
was
i
who
was
going
to
shoot
you
and
if
the
governor
missed
you
i
should
not
have
missed
you
my
dear
friends
how
fortunate
it
is
that
i
am
accustomed
to
take
a
long
aim
instead
of
firing
at
the
instant
i
raise
my
weapon
i
thought
i
recognized
you
ah
my
dear
friends
how
fortunate
and
dartagnan
wiped
his
brow
for
he
had
run
fast
and
emotion
with
him
was
not
feigned
how
said
athos
and
is
the
gentleman
who
fired
at
us
the
governor
of
the
fortress
in
person
and
why
did
he
fire
at
us
what
have
we
done
to
him
pardieu
you
received
what
the
prisoner
threw
to
you
that
is
true
that
platethe
prisoner
has
written
something
on
it
has
he
not
yes
good
heavens
i
was
afraid
he
had
and
dartagnan
with
all
the
marks
of
mortal
disquietude
seized
the
plate
to
read
the
inscription
when
he
had
read
it
a
fearful
pallor
spread
across
his
countenance
oh
good
heavens
repeated
he
silencehere
is
the
governor
and
what
will
he
do
to
us
is
it
our
fault
it
is
true
then
said
athos
in
a
subdued
voice
it
is
true
silence
i
tell
yousilence
if
he
only
believes
you
can
read
if
he
only
suspects
you
have
understood
i
love
you
my
dear
friends
i
would
willingly
be
killed
for
you
but
but
said
athos
and
raoul
but
i
could
not
save
you
from
perpetual
imprisonment
if
i
saved
you
from
death
silence
then
silence
again
the
governor
came
up
having
crossed
the
ditch
upon
a
plank
bridge
well
said
he
to
dartagnan
what
stops
us
you
are
spaniardsyou
do
not
understand
a
word
of
french
said
the
captain
eagerly
to
his
friends
in
a
low
voice
well
replied
he
addressing
the
governor
i
was
right
these
gentlemen
are
two
spanish
captains
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
at
ypres
last
year
they
dont
know
a
word
of
french
ah
said
the
governor
sharply
and
yet
they
were
trying
to
read
the
inscription
on
the
plate
dartagnan
took
it
out
of
his
hands
effacing
the
characters
with
the
point
of
his
sword
how
cried
the
governor
what
are
you
doing
i
cannot
read
them
now
it
is
a
state
secret
replied
dartagnan
bluntly
and
as
you
know
that
according
to
the
kings
orders
it
is
under
the
penalty
of
death
any
one
should
penetrate
it
i
will
if
you
like
allow
you
to
read
it
and
have
you
shot
immediately
afterwards
during
this
apostrophehalf
serious
half
ironicalathos
and
raoul
preserved
the
coolest
most
unconcerned
silence
but
is
it
possible
said
the
governor
that
these
gentlemen
do
not
comprehend
at
least
some
words
suppose
they
do
if
they
do
understand
a
few
spoken
words
it
does
not
follow
that
they
should
understand
what
is
written
they
cannot
even
read
spanish
a
noble
spaniard
remember
ought
never
to
know
how
to
read
the
governor
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
these
explanations
but
he
was
still
tenacious
invite
these
gentlemen
to
come
to
the
fortress
said
he
that
i
will
willingly
do
i
was
about
to
propose
it
to
you
the
fact
is
the
captain
had
quite
another
idea
and
would
have
wished
his
friends
a
hundred
leagues
off
but
he
was
obliged
to
make
the
best
of
it
he
addressed
the
two
gentlemen
in
spanish
giving
them
a
polite
invitation
which
they
accepted
they
all
turned
towards
the
entrance
of
the
fort
and
the
incident
being
at
an
end
the
eight
soldiers
returned
to
their
delightful
leisure
for
a
moment
disturbed
by
this
unexpected
adventure
chapter
xxxii
captive
and
jailers
when
they
had
entered
the
fort
and
whilst
the
governor
was
making
some
preparations
for
the
reception
of
his
guests
come
said
athos
let
us
have
a
word
of
explanation
whilst
we
are
alone
it
is
simply
this
replied
the
musketeer
i
have
conducted
hither
a
prisoner
who
the
king
commands
shall
not
be
seen
you
came
here
he
has
thrown
something
to
you
through
the
lattice
of
his
window
i
was
at
dinner
with
the
governor
i
saw
the
object
thrown
and
i
saw
raoul
pick
it
up
it
does
not
take
long
to
understand
this
i
understood
it
and
i
thought
you
in
intelligence
with
my
prisoner
and
then
and
thenyou
commanded
us
to
be
shot
ma
foi
i
admit
it
but
if
i
was
the
first
to
seize
a
musket
fortunately
i
was
the
last
to
take
aim
at
you
if
you
had
killed
me
dartagnan
i
should
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
die
for
the
royal
house
of
france
and
it
would
be
an
honor
to
die
by
your
handyou
its
noblest
and
most
loyal
defender
what
the
devil
athos
do
you
mean
by
the
royal
house
stammered
dartagnan
you
dont
mean
that
you
a
wellinformed
and
sensible
man
can
place
any
faith
in
the
nonsense
written
by
an
idiot
i
do
believe
in
it
with
so
much
the
more
reason
my
dear
chevalier
from
your
having
orders
to
kill
all
those
who
do
believe
in
it
said
raoul
that
is
because
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeersbecause
every
calumny
however
absurd
it
may
be
has
the
almost
certain
chance
of
becoming
popular
no
dartagnan
replied
athos
promptly
but
because
the
king
is
not
willing
that
the
secret
of
his
family
should
transpire
among
the
people
and
cover
with
shame
the
executioners
of
the
son
of
louis
xiii
do
not
talk
in
such
a
childish
manner
athos
or
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
have
lost
your
senses
besides
explain
to
me
how
it
is
possible
louis
xiii
should
have
a
son
in
the
isle
of
saintemarguerite
a
son
whom
you
have
brought
hither
masked
in
a
fishingboat
said
athos
why
not
dartagnan
was
brought
to
a
pause
oh
said
he
whence
do
you
know
that
a
fishingboat
brought
you
to
saintemarguerites
with
the
carriage
containing
the
prisonerwith
a
prisoner
whom
you
styled
monseigneur
oh
i
am
acquainted
with
all
that
resumed
the
comte
dartagnan
bit
his
mustache
if
it
were
true
said
he
that
i
had
brought
hither
in
a
boat
and
with
a
carriage
a
masked
prisoner
nothing
proves
that
this
prisoner
must
be
a
princea
prince
of
the
house
of
france
ask
aramis
such
riddles
replied
athos
coolly
aramis
cried
the
musketeer
quite
at
a
stand
have
you
seen
aramis
after
his
discomfiture
at
vaux
yes
i
have
seen
aramis
a
fugitive
pursued
bewildered
ruined
and
aramis
has
told
me
enough
to
make
me
believe
in
the
complaints
this
unfortunate
young
prince
cut
upon
the
bottom
of
the
plate
dartagnans
head
sunk
on
his
breast
in
some
confusion
this
is
the
way
said
he
in
which
god
turns
to
nothing
that
which
men
call
wisdom
a
fine
secret
must
that
be
of
which
twelve
or
fifteen
persons
hold
the
tattered
fragments
athos
cursed
be
the
chance
which
has
brought
you
face
to
face
with
me
in
this
affair
for
now
well
said
athos
with
his
customary
mild
severity
is
your
secret
lost
because
i
know
it
consult
your
memory
my
friend
have
i
not
borne
secrets
heavier
than
this
you
have
never
borne
one
so
dangerous
replied
dartagnan
in
a
tone
of
sadness
i
have
something
like
a
sinister
idea
that
all
who
are
concerned
with
this
secret
will
die
and
die
unhappily
the
will
of
god
be
done
said
athos
but
here
is
your
governor
dartagnan
and
his
friends
immediately
resumed
their
parts
the
governor
suspicious
and
hard
behaved
towards
dartagnan
with
a
politeness
almost
amounting
to
obsequiousness
with
respect
to
the
travelers
he
contented
himself
with
offering
good
cheer
and
never
taking
his
eye
from
them
athos
and
raoul
observed
that
he
often
tried
to
embarrass
them
by
sudden
attacks
or
to
catch
them
off
their
guard
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
gave
him
the
least
advantage
what
dartagnan
had
said
was
probable
if
the
governor
did
not
believe
it
to
be
quite
true
they
rose
from
the
table
to
repose
awhile
what
is
this
mans
name
i
dont
like
the
looks
of
him
said
athos
to
dartagnan
in
spanish
de
saintmars
replied
the
captain
he
is
then
i
suppose
the
princes
jailer
eh
how
can
i
tell
i
may
be
kept
at
saintemarguerite
forever
oh
no
not
you
my
friend
i
am
in
the
situation
of
a
man
who
finds
a
treasure
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
he
would
like
to
carry
it
away
but
he
cannot
he
would
like
to
leave
it
but
he
dares
not
the
king
will
not
dare
to
recall
me
for
no
one
else
would
serve
him
as
faithfully
as
i
do
he
regrets
not
having
me
near
him
from
being
aware
that
no
one
would
be
of
so
much
service
near
his
person
as
myself
but
it
will
happen
as
it
may
please
god
but
observed
raoul
your
not
being
certain
proves
that
your
situation
here
is
provisional
and
you
will
return
to
paris
ask
these
gentlemen
interrupted
the
governor
what
was
their
purpose
in
coming
to
saintmarguerite
they
came
from
learning
there
was
a
convent
of
benedictines
at
saintehonnorat
which
is
considered
curious
and
from
being
told
there
was
excellent
shooting
in
the
island
that
is
quite
at
their
service
as
well
as
yours
replied
saintmars
dartagnan
politely
thanked
him
when
will
they
depart
added
the
governor
tomorrow
replied
dartagnan
m
de
saintmars
went
to
make
his
rounds
and
left
dartagnan
alone
with
the
pretended
spaniards
oh
exclaimed
the
musketeer
here
is
a
life
and
a
society
that
suits
me
very
little
i
command
this
man
and
he
bores
me
mordioux
come
let
us
have
a
shot
or
two
at
the
rabbits
the
walk
will
be
beautiful
and
not
fatiguing
the
whole
island
is
but
a
league
and
a
half
in
length
with
the
breadth
of
a
league
a
real
park
let
us
try
to
amuse
ourselves
as
you
please
dartagnan
not
for
the
sake
of
amusing
ourselves
but
to
gain
an
opportunity
for
talking
freely
dartagnan
made
a
sign
to
a
soldier
who
brought
the
gentlemen
some
guns
and
then
returned
to
the
fort
and
now
said
the
musketeer
answer
me
the
question
put
to
you
by
that
blacklooking
saintmars
what
did
you
come
to
do
at
the
lerin
isles
to
bid
you
farewell
bid
me
farewell
what
do
you
mean
by
that
is
raoul
going
anywhere
yes
then
i
will
lay
a
wager
it
is
with
m
de
beaufort
with
m
de
beaufort
it
is
my
dear
friend
you
always
guess
correctly
from
habit
whilst
the
two
friends
were
commencing
their
conversation
raoul
with
his
head
hanging
down
and
his
heart
oppressed
seated
himself
on
a
mossy
rock
his
gun
across
his
knees
looking
at
the
sealooking
at
the
heavens
and
listening
to
the
voice
of
his
soul
he
allowed
the
sportsmen
to
attain
a
considerable
distance
from
him
dartagnan
remarked
his
absence
he
has
not
recovered
the
blow
said
he
to
athos
he
is
struck
to
death
oh
your
fears
exaggerate
i
hope
raoul
is
of
a
tempered
nature
around
all
hearts
as
noble
as
his
there
is
a
second
envelope
that
forms
a
cuirass
the
first
bleeds
the
second
resists
no
replied
athos
raoul
will
die
of
it
mordioux
said
dartagnan
in
a
melancholy
tone
and
he
did
not
add
a
word
to
this
exclamation
then
a
minute
after
why
do
you
let
him
go
because
he
insists
on
going
and
why
do
you
not
go
with
him
because
i
could
not
bear
to
see
him
die
dartagnan
looked
his
friend
earnestly
in
the
face
you
know
one
thing
continued
the
comte
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
the
captain
you
know
that
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
been
afraid
of
but
few
things
well
i
have
an
incessant
gnawing
insurmountable
fear
that
an
hour
will
come
in
which
i
shall
hold
the
dead
body
of
that
boy
in
my
arms
oh
murmured
dartagnan
oh
he
will
die
i
know
i
have
a
perfect
conviction
of
that
but
i
would
not
see
him
die
how
is
this
athos
you
come
and
place
yourself
in
the
presence
of
the
bravest
man
you
say
you
have
ever
seen
of
your
own
dartagnan
of
that
man
without
an
equal
as
you
formerly
called
him
and
you
come
and
tell
him
with
your
arms
folded
that
you
are
afraid
of
witnessing
the
death
of
your
son
you
who
have
seen
all
that
can
be
seen
in
this
world
why
have
you
this
fear
athos
man
upon
this
earth
must
expect
everything
and
ought
to
face
everything
listen
to
me
my
friend
after
having
worn
myself
out
upon
this
earth
of
which
you
speak
i
have
preserved
but
two
religions
that
of
life
friendship
my
duty
as
a
fatherthat
of
eternity
love
and
respect
for
god
now
i
have
within
me
the
revelation
that
if
god
should
decree
that
my
friend
or
my
son
should
render
up
his
last
sigh
in
my
presenceoh
no
i
cannot
even
tell
you
dartagnan
speak
speak
tell
me
i
am
strong
against
everything
except
against
the
death
of
those
i
love
for
that
only
there
is
no
remedy
he
who
dies
gains
he
who
sees
others
die
loses
no
this
is
itto
know
that
i
should
no
more
meet
on
earth
him
whom
i
now
behold
with
joy
to
know
that
there
would
nowhere
be
a
dartagnan
any
more
nowhere
again
be
a
raoul
oh
i
am
old
look
you
i
have
no
longer
courage
i
pray
god
to
spare
me
in
my
weakness
but
if
he
struck
me
so
plainly
and
in
that
fashion
i
should
curse
him
a
christian
gentleman
ought
not
to
curse
his
god
dartagnan
it
is
enough
to
once
have
cursed
a
king
humph
sighed
dartagnan
a
little
confused
by
this
violent
tempest
of
grief
let
me
speak
to
him
athos
who
knows
try
if
you
please
but
i
am
convinced
you
will
not
succeed
i
will
not
attempt
to
console
him
i
will
serve
him
you
will
doubtless
i
will
do
you
think
this
would
be
the
first
time
a
woman
had
repented
of
an
infidelity
i
will
go
to
him
i
tell
you
athos
shook
his
head
and
continued
his
walk
alone
dartagnan
cutting
across
the
brambles
rejoined
raoul
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
well
raoul
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
i
have
a
kindness
to
ask
of
you
replied
bragelonne
ask
it
then
you
will
some
day
return
to
france
i
hope
so
ought
i
to
write
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
no
you
must
not
but
i
have
many
things
to
say
to
her
go
and
say
them
to
her
then
never
pray
what
virtue
do
you
attribute
to
a
letter
which
your
speech
might
not
possess
perhaps
you
are
right
she
loves
the
king
said
dartagnan
bluntly
and
she
is
an
honest
girl
raoul
started
and
you
you
whom
she
abandons
she
perhaps
loves
better
than
she
does
the
king
but
after
another
fashion
dartagnan
do
you
believe
she
loves
the
king
to
idolatry
her
heart
is
inaccessible
to
any
other
feeling
you
might
continue
to
live
near
her
and
would
be
her
best
friend
ah
exclaimed
raoul
with
a
passionate
burst
of
repugnance
at
such
a
hideous
hope
will
you
do
so
it
would
be
base
that
is
a
very
absurd
word
which
would
lead
me
to
think
slightly
of
your
understanding
please
to
understand
raoul
that
it
is
never
base
to
do
that
which
is
imposed
upon
us
by
a
superior
force
if
your
heart
says
to
you
go
there
or
die
why
go
raoul
was
she
base
or
brave
she
whom
you
loved
in
preferring
the
king
to
you
the
king
whom
her
heart
commanded
her
imperiously
to
prefer
to
you
no
she
was
the
bravest
of
women
do
then
as
she
has
done
oblige
yourself
do
you
know
one
thing
of
which
i
am
sure
raoul
what
is
that
why
that
by
seeing
her
closely
with
the
eyes
of
a
jealous
man
well
well
you
would
cease
to
love
her
then
i
am
decided
my
dear
dartagnan
to
set
off
to
see
her
again
no
to
set
off
that
i
may
never
see
her
again
i
wish
to
love
her
forever
ha
i
must
confess
replied
the
musketeer
that
is
a
conclusion
which
i
was
far
from
expecting
this
is
what
i
wish
my
friend
you
will
see
her
again
and
you
will
give
her
a
letter
which
if
you
think
proper
will
explain
to
her
as
to
yourself
what
is
passing
in
my
heart
read
it
i
drew
it
up
last
night
something
told
me
i
should
see
you
today
he
held
the
letter
out
and
dartagnan
read
mademoiselleyou
are
not
wrong
in
my
eyes
in
not
loving
me
you
have
only
been
guilty
of
one
fault
towards
me
that
of
having
left
me
to
believe
you
loved
me
this
error
will
cost
me
my
life
i
pardon
you
but
i
cannot
pardon
myself
it
is
said
that
happy
lovers
are
deaf
to
the
sorrows
of
rejected
lovers
it
will
not
be
so
with
you
who
did
not
love
me
save
with
anxiety
i
am
sure
that
if
i
had
persisted
in
endeavoring
to
change
that
friendship
into
love
you
would
have
yielded
out
of
a
fear
of
bringing
about
my
death
or
lessening
the
esteem
i
had
for
you
it
is
much
more
delightful
to
me
to
die
knowing
that
you
are
free
and
satisfied
how
much
then
will
you
love
me
when
you
will
no
longer
fear
either
my
presence
or
reproaches
you
will
love
me
because
however
charming
a
new
love
may
appear
to
you
god
has
not
made
me
in
anything
inferior
to
him
you
have
chosen
and
because
my
devotedness
my
sacrifice
and
my
painful
end
will
assure
me
in
your
eyes
a
certain
superiority
over
him
i
have
allowed
to
escape
in
the
candid
credulity
of
my
heart
the
treasure
i
possessed
many
people
tell
me
that
you
loved
me
enough
to
lead
me
to
hope
you
would
have
loved
me
much
that
idea
takes
from
my
mind
all
bitterness
and
leads
me
only
to
blame
myself
you
will
accept
this
last
farewell
and
you
will
bless
me
for
having
taken
refuge
in
the
inviolable
asylum
where
hatred
is
extinguished
and
where
all
love
endures
forever
adieu
mademoiselle
if
your
happiness
could
be
purchased
by
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
i
would
shed
that
drop
i
willingly
make
the
sacrifice
of
it
to
my
misery
raoul
vicotme
de
bragelonne
the
letter
reads
very
well
said
the
captain
i
have
only
one
fault
to
find
with
it
tell
me
what
that
is
said
raoul
why
it
is
that
it
tells
everything
except
the
thing
which
exhales
like
a
mortal
poison
from
your
eyes
and
from
your
heart
except
the
senseless
love
which
still
consumes
you
raoul
grew
paler
but
remained
silent
why
did
you
not
write
simply
these
words
mademoiselleinstead
of
cursing
you
i
love
you
and
i
die
that
is
true
exclaimed
raoul
with
a
sinister
kind
of
joy
and
tearing
the
letter
he
had
just
taken
back
he
wrote
the
following
words
upon
a
leaf
of
his
tablets
to
procure
the
happiness
of
once
more
telling
you
i
love
you
i
commit
the
baseness
of
writing
to
you
and
to
punish
myself
for
that
baseness
i
die
and
he
signed
it
you
will
give
her
these
tablets
captain
will
you
not
when
asked
the
latter
on
the
day
said
bragelonne
pointing
to
the
last
sentence
on
the
day
when
you
can
place
a
date
under
these
words
and
he
sprang
away
quickly
to
join
athos
who
was
returning
with
slow
steps
as
they
reentered
the
fort
the
sea
rose
with
that
rapid
gusty
vehemence
which
characterizes
the
mediterranean
the
illhumor
of
the
element
became
a
tempest
something
shapeless
and
tossed
about
violently
by
the
waves
appeared
just
off
the
coast
what
is
that
said
athosa
wrecked
boat
no
it
is
not
a
boat
said
dartagnan
pardon
me
said
raoul
there
is
a
bark
gaining
the
port
rapidly
yes
there
is
a
bark
in
the
creek
which
is
prudently
seeking
shelter
here
but
that
which
athos
points
to
in
the
sand
is
not
a
boat
at
allit
has
run
aground
yes
yes
i
see
it
it
is
the
carriage
which
i
threw
into
the
sea
after
landing
the
prisoner
well
said
athos
if
you
take
my
advice
dartagnan
you
will
burn
that
carriage
in
order
that
no
vestige
of
it
may
remain
without
which
the
fishermen
of
antibes
who
have
believed
they
had
to
do
with
the
devil
will
endeavor
to
prove
that
your
prisoner
was
but
a
man
your
advice
is
good
athos
and
i
will
this
night
have
it
carried
out
or
rather
i
will
carry
it
out
myself
but
let
us
go
in
for
the
rain
falls
heavily
and
the
lightning
is
terrific
as
they
were
passing
over
the
ramparts
to
a
gallery
of
which
dartagnan
had
the
key
they
saw

directing
his
steps
towards
the
chamber
inhabited
by
the
prisoner
upon
a
sign
from
dartagnan
they
concealed
themselves
in
an
angle
of
the
staircase
what
is
it
said
athos
you
will
see
look
the
prisoner
is
returning
from
chapel
and
they
saw
by
the
red
flashes
of
lightning
against
the
violet
fog
which
the
wind
stamped
upon
the
bankward
sky
they
saw
pass
gravely
at
six
paces
behind
the
governor
a
man
clothed
in
black
and
masked
by
a
vizor
of
polished
steel
soldered
to
a
helmet
of
the
same
nature
which
altogether
enveloped
the
whole
of
his
head
the
fire
of
the
heavens
cast
red
reflections
on
the
polished
surface
and
these
reflections
flying
off
capriciously
seemed
to
be
angry
looks
launched
by
the
unfortunate
instead
of
imprecations
in
the
middle
of
the
gallery
the
prisoner
stopped
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
the
infinite
horizon
to
respire
the
sulphurous
perfumes
of
the
tempest
to
drink
in
thirstily
the
hot
rain
and
to
breathe
a
sigh
resembling
a
smothered
groan
come
on
monsieur
said
saintmars
sharply
to
the
prisoner
for
he
already
became
uneasy
at
seeing
him
look
so
long
beyond
the
walls
monsieur
come
on
say
monseigneur
cried
athos
from
his
corner
with
a
voice
so
solemn
and
terrible
that
the
governor
trembled
from
head
to
foot
athos
insisted
upon
respect
being
paid
to
fallen
majesty
the
prisoner
turned
round
who
spoke
asked
saintmars
it
was
i
replied
dartagnan
showing
himself
promptly
you
know
that
is
the
order
call
me
neither
monsieur
nor
monseigneur
said
the
prisoner
in
his
turn
in
a
voice
that
penetrated
to
the
very
soul
of
raoul
call
me
accursed
he
passed
on
and
the
iron
door
croaked
after
him
there
goes
a
truly
unfortunate
man
murmured
the
musketeer
in
a
hollow
whisper
pointing
out
to
raoul
the
chamber
inhabited
by
the
prince
chapter
xxxiii
promises
scarcely
had
dartagnan
reentered
his
apartment
with
his
two
friends
when
one
of
the
soldiers
of
the
fort
came
to
inform
him
that
the
governor
was
seeking
him
the
bark
which
raoul
had
perceived
at
sea
and
which
appeared
so
eager
to
gain
the
port
came
to
saintemarguerite
with
an
important
dispatch
for
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
on
opening
it
dartagnan
recognized
the
writing
of
the
king
i
should
think
said
louis
xiv
you
will
have
completed
the
execution
of
my
orders
monsieur
dartagnan
return
then
immediately
to
paris
and
join
me
at
the
louvre
there
is
the
end
of
my
exile
cried
the
musketeer
with
joy
god
be
praised
i
am
no
longer
a
jailer
and
he
showed
the
letter
to
athos
so
then
you
must
leave
us
replied
the
latter
in
a
melancholy
tone
yes
but
to
meet
again
dear
friend
seeing
that
raoul
is
old
enough
now
to
go
alone
with
m
de
beaufort
and
will
prefer
his
father
going
back
in
company
with
m
dartagnan
to
forcing
him
to
travel
two
hundred
leagues
solitarily
to
reach
home
at
la
fere
will
you
not
raoul
certainly
stammered
the
latter
with
an
expression
of
tender
regret
no
no
my
friend
interrupted
athos
i
will
never
quit
raoul
till
the
day
his
vessel
disappears
on
the
horizon
as
long
as
he
remains
in
france
he
shall
not
be
separated
from
me
as
you
please
dear
friend
but
we
will
at
least
leave
saintemarguerite
together
take
advantage
of
the
bark
that
will
convey
me
back
to
antibes
with
all
my
heart
we
cannot
too
soon
be
at
a
distance
from
this
fort
and
from
the
spectacle
that
shocked
us
so
just
now
the
three
friends
quitted
the
little
isle
after
paying
their
respects
to
the
governor
and
by
the
last
flashes
of
the
departing
tempest
they
took
their
farewell
of
the
white
walls
of
the
fort
dartagnan
parted
from
his
friend
that
same
night
after
having
seen
fire
set
to
the
carriage
upon
the
shore
by
the
orders
of
saintmars
according
to
the
advice
the
captain
had
given
him
before
getting
on
horseback
and
after
leaving
the
arms
of
athos
my
friends
said
he
you
bear
too
much
resemblance
to
two
soldiers
who
are
abandoning
their
post
something
warns
me
that
raoul
will
require
being
supported
by
you
in
his
rank
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
permission
to
go
over
into
africa
with
a
hundred
good
muskets
the
king
will
not
refuse
me
and
i
will
take
you
with
me
monsieur
dartagnan
replied
raoul
pressing
his
hand
with
emotion
thanks
for
that
offer
which
would
give
us
more
than
we
wish
either
monsieur
le
comte
or
i
i
who
am
young
stand
in
need
of
labor
of
mind
and
fatigue
of
body
monsieur
le
comte
wants
the
profoundest
repose
you
are
his
best
friend
i
recommend
him
to
your
care
in
watching
over
him
you
are
holding
both
our
souls
in
your
hands
i
must
go
my
horse
is
all
in
a
fret
said
dartagnan
with
whom
the
most
manifest
sign
of
a
lively
emotion
was
the
change
of
ideas
in
conversation
come
comte
how
many
days
longer
has
raoul
to
stay
here
three
days
at
most
and
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
reach
home
oh
a
considerable
time
replied
athos
i
shall
not
like
the
idea
of
being
separated
too
quickly
from
raoul
time
will
travel
too
fast
of
itself
to
require
me
to
aid
it
by
distance
i
shall
only
make
halfstages
and
why
so
my
friend
nothing
is
more
dull
than
traveling
slowly
and
hostelry
life
does
not
become
a
man
like
you
my
friend
i
came
hither
on
posthorses
but
i
wish
to
purchase
two
animals
of
a
superior
kind
now
to
take
them
home
fresh
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
make
them
travel
more
than
seven
or
eight
leagues
a
day
where
is
grimaud
he
arrived
yesterday
morning
with
raouls
appointments
and
i
have
left
him
to
sleep
that
is
never
to
come
back
again
dartagnan
suffered
to
escape
him
till
we
meet
again
then
dear
athosand
if
you
are
diligent
i
shall
embrace
you
the
sooner
so
saying
he
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
which
raoul
held
farewell
said
the
young
man
embracing
him
farewell
said
dartagnan
as
he
got
into
his
saddle
his
horse
made
a
movement
which
divided
the
cavalier
from
his
friends
this
scene
had
taken
place
in
front
of
the
house
chosen
by
athos
near
the
gates
of
antibes
whither
dartagnan
after
his
supper
had
ordered
his
horses
to
be
brought
the
road
began
to
branch
off
there
white
and
undulating
in
the
vapors
of
the
night
the
horse
eagerly
respired
the
salt
sharp
perfume
of
the
marshes
dartagnan
put
him
to
a
trot
and
athos
and
raoul
sadly
turned
towards
the
house
all
at
once
they
heard
the
rapid
approach
of
a
horses
steps
and
first
believed
it
to
be
one
of
those
singular
repercussions
which
deceive
the
ear
at
every
turn
in
a
road
but
it
was
really
the
return
of
the
horseman
they
uttered
a
cry
of
joyous
surprise
and
the
captain
springing
to
the
ground
like
a
young
man
seized
within
his
arms
the
two
beloved
heads
of
athos
and
raoul
he
held
them
long
embraced
thus
without
speaking
a
word
or
suffering
the
sigh
which
was
bursting
his
breast
to
escape
him
then
as
rapidly
as
he
had
come
back
he
set
off
again
with
a
sharp
application
of
his
spurs
to
the
sides
of
his
fiery
horse
alas
said
the
comte
in
a
low
voice
alas
alas
an
evil
omen
on
his
side
said
dartagnan
to
himself
making
up
for
lost
time
i
could
not
smile
upon
them
an
evil
omen
the
next
day
grimaud
was
on
foot
again
the
service
commanded
by
m
de
beaufort
was
happily
accomplished
the
flotilla
sent
to
toulon
by
the
exertions
of
raoul
had
set
out
dragging
after
it
in
little
nutshells
almost
invisible
the
wives
and
friends
of
the
fishermen
and
smugglers
put
in
requisition
for
the
service
of
the
fleet
the
time
so
short
which
remained
for
father
and
son
to
live
together
appeared
to
go
by
with
double
rapidity
like
some
swift
stream
that
flows
towards
eternity
athos
and
raoul
returned
to
toulon
which
began
to
be
filled
with
the
noise
of
carriages
with
the
noise
of
arms
the
noise
of
neighing
horses
the
trumpeters
sounded
their
spirited
marches
the
drummers
signalized
their
strength
the
streets
were
overflowing
with
soldiers
servants
and
tradespeople
the
duc
de
beaufort
was
everywhere
superintending
the
embarkation
with
the
zeal
and
interest
of
a
good
captain
he
encouraged
the
humblest
of
his
companions
he
scolded
his
lieutenants
even
those
of
the
highest
rank
artillery
provisions
baggage
he
insisted
upon
seeing
all
himself
he
examined
the
equipment
of
every
soldier
assured
himself
of
the
health
and
soundness
of
every
horse
it
was
plain
that
light
boastful
egotistical
in
his
hotel
the
gentleman
became
the
soldier
againthe
high
noble
a
captainin
face
of
the
responsibility
he
had
accepted
and
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
whatever
was
the
care
with
which
he
presided
over
the
preparations
for
departure
it
was
easy
to
perceive
careless
precipitation
and
the
absence
of
all
the
precaution
that
make
the
french
soldier
the
first
soldier
in
the
world
because
in
that
world
he
is
the
one
most
abandoned
to
his
own
physical
and
moral
resources
all
things
having
satisfied
or
appearing
to
have
satisfied
the
admiral
he
paid
his
compliments
to
raoul
and
gave
the
last
orders
for
sailing
which
was
ordered
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
he
invited
the
comte
had
his
son
to
dine
with
him
but
they
under
a
pretext
of
service
kept
themselves
apart
gaining
their
hostelry
situated
under
the
trees
of
the
great
place
they
took
their
repast
in
haste
and
athos
led
raoul
to
the
rocks
which
dominate
the
city
vast
gray
mountains
whence
the
view
is
infinite
and
embraces
a
liquid
horizon
which
appears
so
remote
is
it
on
a
level
with
the
rocks
themselves
the
night
was
fine
as
it
always
is
in
these
happy
climes
the
moon
rising
behind
the
rocks
unrolled
a
silver
sheet
on
the
cerulean
carpet
of
the
sea
in
the
roadsteads
maneuvered
silently
the
vessels
which
had
just
taken
their
rank
to
facilitate
the
embarkation
the
sea
loaded
with
phosphoric
light
opened
beneath
the
hulls
of
the
barks
that
transported
the
baggage
and
munitions

up

from
every
oar
dropped
liquid
diamonds
the
sailors
rejoicing
in
the
largesses
of
the
admiral
were
heard
murmuring
their
slow
and
artless
songs
sometimes
the
grinding
of
the
chains
was
mixed
with
the
dull
noise
of
shot
falling
into
the
holds
such
harmonies
such
a
spectacle

the
heart

athos
had
seated
himself
with
his
son
upon
the
moss
among
the
brambles
of
the
promontory
around
their
heads
passed
and
repassed
large
bats
carried
along
by
the
fearful
whirl
of
their
blind
chase
the
feet
of
raoul
were
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
bathed
in
that
void
which
is
peopled
by
vertigo
and
provokes
to
selfannihilation
when
the
moon
had
risen
to
its
fullest
height
caressing
with
light
the
neighboring
peaks
when
the
watery
mirror
was
illumined
in
its
full
extent
and
the
little
red
fires
had
made
their
openings
in
the
black
masses
of
every
ship

collecting
all
his
ideas
and
all
his
courage

god
has
made
all
these
things
that
we
see

he
has

up
with
this
monstrous
universe
we
shine
like

like
those
waves
we
suffer
like
those
great
ships
which
are
worn
out
in
plowing
the
waves
in
obeying
the
wind
that
urges
them
towards
an
end
as
the
breath
of
god
blows
us
towards

everything

beautiful
to
living

monsieur
said
raoul
we
have
before
us
a
beautiful
spectacle
how
good
dartagnan
is
interrupted
athos
suddenly
and
what
a
rare
good
fortune
it
is
to
be
supported
during
a
whole
life
by
such
a
friend
as
he
is
that
is
what
you
have
missed

i
have
wanted
a
friend
m
de
guiche
is
an
agreeable
companion
resumed
the
comte
coldly
but
i
believe
in
the
times
in
which
you
live
men
are
more
engaged
in
their
own
interests
and
their
own
pleasures
than
they
were
in
ours
you
have
sought
a
secluded
life
that
is
a
great
happiness
but
you
have
lost
your
strength
thereby
we
four
more
weaned
from
those
delicate
abstractions
that
constitute
your
joy
furnished
much
more
resistance
when
misfortune
presented
itself
i
have
not
interrupted
you
monsieur
to
tell
you
that
i
had
a
friend
and
that
that
friend
is
m
de
guiche
certes
he
is
good
and
generous
and
moreover
he
loves
me
but
i
have
lived
under
the
guardianship
of
another
friendship
monsieur
as
precious
and
as
strong
as
that
of
which
you
speak
since
it
is
yours
i
have
not
been
a
friend
for
you
raoul
said
athos
eh
monsieur
and
in
what
respect
not
because
i
have
given
you
reason
to
think
that
life
has
but
one
face
because
sad
and
severe
alas
i
have
always
cut
off
for
you
without
god
knows
wishing
to
do
so
the
joyous
buds
that
spring
incessantly
from
the
fair
tree
of
youth
so
that
at
this
moment
i
repent
of
not
having
made
of
you
a
more
expansive
dissipated
animated
man
i
know
why
you
say
that
monsieur
no
it
is
not
you
who
have
made
me
what
i
am
it
was
love
which
took
me
at
the
time
when
children
only
have
inclinations
it
is
the
constancy
natural
to
my
character
which
with
other
creatures
is
but
habit
i
believed
that
i
should
always
be
as
i
was
i
thought
god
had
cast
me
in
a
path
quite
clear
quite
straight
bordered
with
fruits
and
flowers
i
had
ever
watching
over
me
your
vigilance
and
strength
i
believed
myself
to
be
vigilant
and
strong
nothing
prepared
me
i
fell
once
and
that
once
deprived
me
of
courage
for
the
whole
of
my
life
it
is
quite
true
that
i
wrecked
myself
oh
no
monsieur
you
are
nothing
in
my
past
but
happinessin
my
future
but
hope
no
i
have
no
reproach
to
make
against
life
such
as
you
made
it
for
me
i
bless
you
and
i
love
you
ardently
my
dear
raoul
your
words
do
me
good
they
prove
to
me
that
you
will
act
a
little
for
me
in
the
time
to
come
i
shall
only
act
for
you
monsieur
raoul
what
i
have
never
hitherto
done
with
respect
to
you
i
will
henceforward
do
i
will
be
your
friend
not
your
father
we
will
live
in
expanding
ourselves
instead
of
living
and
holding
ourselves
prisoners
when
you
come
back
and
that
will
be
soon
will
it
not
certainly
monsieur
for
such
an
expedition
cannot
last
long
soon
then
raoul
soon
instead
of
living
moderately
on
my
income
i
will
give
you
the
capital
of
my
estates
it
will
suffice
for
launching
you
into
the
world
till
my
death
and
you
will
give
me
i
hope
before
that
time
the
consolation
of
not
seeing
my
race
extinct
i
will
do
all
you
may
command
said
raoul
much
agitated
it
is
not
necessary
raoul
that
your
duty
as
aidedecamp
should
lead
you
into
too
hazardous
enterprises
you
have
gone
through
your
ordeal
you
are
known
to
be
a
true
man
under
fire
remember
that
war
with
arabs
is
a
war
of
snares
ambuscades
and
assassinations
so
it
is
said
monsieur
there
is
never
much
glory
in
falling
in
an
ambuscade
it
is
a
death
which
always
implies
a
little
rashness
or
want
of
foresight
often
indeed
he
who
falls
in
one
meets
with
but
little
pity
those
who
are
not
pitied
raoul
have
died
to
little
purpose
still
further

conqueror
laughs
and
we
frenchmen
ought
not
to
allow
stupid
infidels
to
triumph
over
our
faults
do
you
clearly
understand
what
i
am
saying
to
you
raoul
god
forbid
i
should
encourage
you
to
avoid
encounters
i
am
naturally
prudent
monsieur
and
i
have
very
good
fortune
said
raoul
with
a
smile
which
chilled
the
heart
of
his
poor
father
for
the
young
man
hastened
to
add
in
twenty
combats
through
which
i
have

to
send
him
an

or
the
plague
rather
than
the
fever
oh
monsieur
with
sobriety
with
reasonable
exercise
i
have
already
obtained
from
m
de
beaufort
a
promise
that
his
dispatches
shall
be
sent
off
every
fortnight
to
france
you
as
his
aidedecamp
will
be
charged
with
expediting
them
and
will
be
sure
not
to
forget
me
no
monsieur
said
raoul
almost
choked
with
emotion
besides
raoul
as
you
are
a
good
christian
and
i
am
one
also
we
ought
to
reckon
upon
a
more
special
protection
of
god
and
his
guardian
angels
promise
me
that
if
anything
evil
should
happen
to
you
on
any
occasion
you
will
think
of
me
at
once
first
and
at
once
oh
yes
monsieur
and
will
call
upon
me
instantly
you
dream
of
me
sometimes
do
you
not
raoul
every
night
monsieur
during
my
early
youth
i
saw
you
in
my
dreams
calm
and
mild
with
one
hand
stretched
out
over
my
head
and
that
it
was
which
made
me
sleep
so
soundlyformerly
we
love
each
other
too
dearly
said
the
comte
that
from
this
moment
in
which
we
separate
a
portion
of
both
our
souls
should
not
travel
with
one
and
the
other
of
us
and
should
not
dwell
wherever
we
may
dwell
whenever
you
may
be
sad
raoul
i
feel
that
my
heart
will
be
dissolved
in
sadness
and
when
you
smile
on
thinking
of
me
be
assured
you
will
send
me
from
however
remote
a
distance
a
vital
scintillation
of
your
joy
i
will
not
promise
you
to
be
joyous
replied
the
young
man
but
you
may
be
certain
that
i
will
never
pass
an
hour
without
thinking
of
you
not
one
hour
i
swear
unless
i
shall
be
dead
athos
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
threw
his
arm
round
the
neck
of
his
son
and
held
him
embraced
with
all
the
power
of
his
heart
the
moon
began
to
be
now
eclipsed
by
twilight
a
golden
band
surrounded
the
horizon
announcing
the
approach
of
the
day
athos
threw
his
cloak
over
the
shoulders
of
raoul
and
led
him
back
to
the
city
where
burdens
and
porters
were
already
in
motion
like
a
vast
anthill
at
the
extremity
of
the
plateau
which
athos
and
bragelonne
were
quitting
they
saw
a
dark
shadow
moving
uneasily
backwards
and
forwards
as
if
in
indecision
or
ashamed
to
be
seen
it
was
grimaud
who
in
his
anxiety
had
tracked
his
master
and
was
there
awaiting
him
oh
my
good
grimaud
cried
raoul
what
do
you
want
you
are
come
to
tell
us
it
is
time
to
be
gone
have
you
not
alone
said
grimaud
addressing
athos
and
pointing
to
raoul
in
a
tone
of
reproach
which
showed
to
what
an
extent
the
old
man
was
troubled
oh
you
are
right
cried
the
comte
no
raoul
shall
not
go
alone
no
he
shall
not
be
left
alone
in
a
strange
land
without
some
friendly
hand
to
support
him
some
friendly
heart
to
recall
to
him
all
he
loved
i
said
grimaud
you
yes
you
cried
raoul
touched
to
the
inmost
heart
alas
said
athos
you
are
very
old
my
good
grimaud
so
much
the
better
replied
the
latter
with
an
inexpressible
depth
of
feeling
and
intelligence
but
the
embarkation
is
begun
said
raoul
and
you
are
not
prepared
yes
said
grimaud
showing
the
keys
of
his
trunks
mixed
with
those
of
his
young
master
but
again
objected
raoul
you
cannot
leave
monsieur
le
comte
thus
alone
monsieur
le
comte
whom
you
have
never
quitted
grimaud
turned
his
diamond
eyes
upon
athos
and
raoul
as
if
to
measure
the
strength
of
both
the
comte
uttered
not
a
word
monsieur
le
comte
prefers
my
going
said
grimaud
i
do
said
athos
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
at
that
moment
the
drums
suddenly
rolled
and
the
clarions
filled
the
air
with
their
inspiring
notes
the
regiments
destined
for
the
expedition

to
debouch
from

gayly
towards

carried
them
in

closing
the
march
with
his

take
a
full
hour
before
he
could
reach
the
sea
raoul
with
athos
turned
his
steps
slowly
towards
the
beach
in
order
to
take
his
place
when
the
prince
embarked
grimaud
boiling
with
the
ardor
of
a
young
man

with
his

through

was
about
to
lose

in
melancholy
meditation
was
deaf
to
every
noise
around
him
an
officer
came
quickly
towards
them
to
inform
raoul
that
m
de
beaufort
was
anxious
to
have
him
by
his
side
have
the
kindness
to
tell
the
prince
said
raoul
that
i
request
he
will
allow
me
this
hour
to
enjoy
the
company
of
my
father
no
no
said
athos
an
aidedecamp
ought
not
thus
to
quit
his
general
please
to
tell
the
prince
monsieur
that
the
vicomte
will
join
him
immediately
the
officer
set
off
at
a
gallop
whether
we
part
here
or
part
there
added
the
comte
it
is
no
less
a
separation
he
carefully
brushed
the
dust
from
his
sons
coat
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
hair
as
they
walked
along
but
raoul
said
he
you
want
money
m
de
beauforts
train
will
be
splendid
and
i
am
certain
it
will
be
agreeable
to
you
to
purchase
horses
and
arms
which
are
very
dear
things
in
africa
now
as
you
are
not
actually
in
the
service
of
the
king
or
m
de
beaufort
and
are
simply
a
volunteer
you
must
not
reckon
upon
either
pay
or
largesse
but
i
should
not
like
you
to
want
for
anything
at
gigelli
here
are
two
hundred
pistoles
if
you
would
please
me
raoul
spend
them
raoul
pressed
the
hand
of
his
father
and
at
the
turning
of
a
street
they
saw
m
de
beaufort
mounted
on
a
magnificent
white
genet
which
responded
by
graceful
curvets
to
the
applause
of
the
women
of
the
city
the
duke
called
raoul
and
held
out
his
hand
to
the
comte
he
spoke
to
him
for
some
time
with
such
a
kindly
expression
that
the
heart
of
the
poor
father
even
felt
a
little
comforted
it
was
however
evident
to
both
father
and
son
that
their
walk
amounted
to
nothing
less
than
a
punishment
there
was
a
terrible
momentthat
at
which
on
quitting
the
sands
of
the
shore
the
soldiers
and
sailors
exchanged
the
last
kisses
with
their
families
and
friends
a
supreme
moment
in
which
notwithstanding
the
clearness
of
the
heavens
the
warmth
of
the
sun
of
the
perfumes
of
the
air
and
the
rich
life
that
was
circulating
in
their
veins
everything
appeared
black
everything
bitter
everything
created
doubts
of
providence
nay
at
the
most
of
god
it
was
customary
for
the
admiral

not

to

his
feelings
from
his
friends
so
much
as
he
would
have

the

the

overcome
by
fear
and
sad
presentiments
had
yielded
for
a
few
moments
to
human
weakness
when
therefore
he
had
silenced
his
heart
and
calmed
the
agitation
of
his
nerves
turning
towards
his
lackey

captain
replied
rabaud
and
from
that
moment
dartagnan
accommodating
his
action
to
the
pace
of
the
horse
like
a
true
centaur
gave
up
his
thoughts
to
nothingthat
is
to
say
to
everything
he
asked
himself
why
the
king
had
sent
for
him
back
why
the
iron
mask
had
thrown
the
silver
plate
at
the
feet
of
raoul
as
to
the
first
subject
the
reply
was
negative
he
knew
right
well
that
the
kings
calling
him
was
from
necessity
he
still
further
knew
that
louis
xiv
must
experience
an
imperious
desire
for
a
private
conversation
with
one
whom
the
possession
of
such
a
secret
placed
on
a
level
with
the
highest
powers
of
the
kingdom
but
as
to
saying
exactly
what
the
kings
wish
was
dartagnan
found
himself
completely
at
a
loss
the
musketeer
had
no
doubts
either
upon
the
reason
which
had
urged
the
unfortunate
philippe
to
reveal
his
character
and
birth
philippe
buried
forever
beneath
a
mask
of
steel
exiled
to
a
country
where
the
men
seemed
little
more
than
slaves
of
the
elements
philippe
deprived
even
of
the
society
of
dartagnan
who
had
loaded
him
with
honors
and
delicate
attentions
had
nothing
more
to
see
than
odious
specters
in
this
world
and
despair
beginning
to
devour
him
he
poured
himself
forth
in
complaints
in
the
belief
that
his
revelations
would
raise
up
some
avenger
for
him
the
manner
in
which
the
musketeer
had
been
near
killing
his
two
best
friends
the
destiny
which
had
so
strangely
brought
athos
to
participate
in
the
great
state
secret
the
farewell
of
raoul
the
obscurity
of
the
future
which
threatened
to
end
in
a
melancholy
death
all
this
threw
dartagnan
incessantly
back
on
lamentable
predictions
and
forebodings
which
the
rapidity
of
his
pace
did
not
dissipate
as
it
used
formerly
to
do
dartagnan
passed
from
these
considerations
to
the
remembrance
of
the
proscribed
porthos
and
aramis
he
saw
them
both
fugitives
tracked
ruinedlaborious
architects
of
fortunes
they
had
lost
and
as
the
king
called
for
his
man
of
execution
in
hours
of
vengeance
and
malice
dartagnan
trembled
at
the
very
idea
of
receiving
some
commission
that
would
make
his
very
soul
bleed
sometimes
ascending
hills
when
the
winded
horse
breathed
hard
from
his
red
nostrils
and
heaved
his
flanks
the
captain
left
to
more
freedom
of
thought
reflected
on
the
prodigious
genius
of
aramis
a
genius
of
acumen
and
intrigue
a
match
to
which
the
fronde
and
the
civil
war
had
produced
but
twice
soldier
priest
diplomatist
gallant
avaricious
cunning
aramis
had
never
taken
the
good
things
of
this
life
except
as
steppingstones
to
rise
to
giddier
ends
generous
in
spirit
if
not
lofty
in
heart
he
never
did
ill
but
for
the
sake
of
shining
even
yet
more
brilliantly
towards
the
end
of
his
career
at
the
moment
of
reaching
the
goal
like
the
patrician
fuscus
he
had
made
a
false
step
upon
a
plank
and
had
fallen
into
the
sea

very
stones
dishonored
even
to
the
timberthese
were
so
many
poignant
griefs
for
dartagnan
and
every
time
that
one
of
these
griefs
struck
him
he
bounded
like
a
horse
at
the
sting
of
a
gadfly
beneath
the
vaults
of
foliage
where
he
has
sought
shady
shelter
from
the
burning
sun
never
was
the
man
of
spirit
subjected
to
ennui
if
his
body
was
exposed
to
fatigue
never
did
the
man
of
healthy
body
fail
to
find
life
light
if
he
had
something
to
engage
his
mind
dartagnan
riding
fast
thinking
as
constantly
alighted
from
his
horse
in
pairs
fresh
and
tender
in
his
muscles
as
the
athlete
preparing
for
the
gymnasium
the
king
did
not
expect
him
so
soon
and
had
just
departed
for
the
chase
towards
meudon
dartagnan
instead
of
riding
after
the
king
as
he
would
formerly
have
done
took
off
his
boots
had
a
bath
and
waited
till
his
majesty
should
return
dusty
and
tired
he
occupied
the
interval
of
five
hours
in
taking
as
people
say
the
air
of
the
house
and
in
arming
himself
against
all
ill
chances
he
learned
that
the
king
during
the
last
fortnight
had
been
gloomy
that
the
queenmother
was
ill
and
much
depressed
that
monsieur
the
kings
brother
was
exhibiting
a
devotional
turn
that
madame
had
the
vapors
and
that
m
de
guiche
was
gone
to
one
of
his
estates
he
learned
that
m
colbert
was
radiant
that
m
fouquet
consulted
a
fresh
physician
every
day
who
still
did
not
cure
him
and
that
his
principal
complaint
was
one
which
physicians
do
not
usually
cure
unless
they
are
political
physicians
the
king
dartagnan
was
told
behaved
in
the
kindest
manner
to
m
fouquet
and
did
not
allow
him
to
be
ever
out
of
his
sight
but
the
surintendant
touched
to
the
heart
like
one
of
those
fine
trees
a
worm
has
punctured
was
declining
daily
in
spite
of
the
royal
smile
that
sun
of
court
trees
dartagnan
learned
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
become
indispensable
to
the
king
that
the
king
during
his
sporting
excursions
if
he
did
not
take
her
with
him
wrote
to
her
frequently
no
longer
verses
but
which
was
much
worse
prose
and
that
whole
pages
at
a
time
thus
as
the
political
pleiad
of
the
day
said
the
first
king
in
the
world
was
seen
descending
from
his
horse
with
an
ardor
beyond
compare
and
on
the
crown
of
his
hat
scrawling
bombastic
phrases
which
m
de
saintaignan
aidedecamp
in
perpetuity
carried
to
la
valliere
at
the
risk
of
foundering
his
horses
during
this
time
deer
and
pheasants
were
left
to
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
nature
hunted
so
lazily
that
it
was
said
the
art
of
venery
ran
great
risk
of
degenerating
at
the
court
of
france
dartagnan
then
thought
of
the
wishes
of
poor
raoul
of
that
desponding
letter
destined
for
a
woman
who
passed
her
life
in
hoping
and
as
dartagnan
loved
to
philosophize
a
little
occasionally
he
resolved
to
profit
by
the
absence
of
the
king
to
have
a
minutes
talk
with
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
this
was
a
very
easy
affair
while
the
king
was
hunting
louise
was
walking
with
some
other
ladies
in
one
of
the
galleries
of
the
palais
royal
exactly
where
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
had
some
guards
to
inspect
dartagnan
did
not
doubt
that
if
he
could
but
open
the
conversation
on
raoul
louise
might
give
him
grounds
for
writing
a
consolatory
letter
to
the
poor
exile
and
hope
or
at
least
consolation
for
raoul
in
the
state
of
heart
in
which
he
had
left
him
was
the
sun
was
life
to
two
men
who
were
very
dear
to
our
captain
he
directed
his
course
therefore
to
the
spot
where
he
knew
he
should
find
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
dartagnan
found
la
valliere
the
center
of
the
circle
in
her
apparent
solitude
the
kings
favorite
received
like
a
queen
more
perhaps
than
the
queen
a
homage
of
which
madame
had
been
so
proud
when
all
the
kings
looks
were
directed
to
her
and
commanded
the
looks
of
the
courtiers
dartagnan
although
no
squire
of
dames
received
nevertheless
civilities
and
attentions
from
the
ladies
he
was
polite
as
a
brave
man
always
is
and
his
terrible
reputation
had
conciliated
as
much
friendship
among
the
men
as
admiration
among
the
women
on
seeing
him
enter
therefore
they
immediately
accosted
him
and
as
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
with
fair
ladies
opened
the
attack
by
questions
where
had
he
been
what
had
become
of
him
so
long
why
had
they
not
seen
him
as
usual
make
his
fine
horse
curvet
in
such
beautiful
style
to
the
delight
and
astonishment
of
the
curious
from
the
kings
balcony
he
replied
that
he
had
just
come
from
the
land
of
oranges
this
set
all
the
ladies
laughing
those
were
times
in
which
everybody
traveled
but
in
which
notwithstanding
a
journey
of
a
hundred
leagues
was
a
problem
often
solved
by
death
from
the

m
de
beaufort
is
at
this
moment
embarking
for
algiers
have
you
seen
the
army
asked
several
warlike
fair
ones
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
replied
dartagnan
and
the
fleet
yes
i
saw
everything
have
we
any
of
us
any
friends
there
said
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
coldly
but
in
a
manner
to
attract
attention
to
a
question
that
was
not
without
its
calculated
aim
why
replied
dartagnan
yes
there
were
m
de
la
guillotiere
m
de
manchy
m
de
bragelonne
la
valliere
became
pale
m
de
bragelonne
cried
the
perfidious
athenais
eh
whatis
he
gone
to
the
warshe
montalais
trod
on
her
toe
but
all
in
vain
do
you
know
what
my
opinion
is
continued
she
addressing
dartagnan
no
mademoiselle
but
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
it
my
opinion
is
then
that
all
the
men
who
go
to
this
war
are
desperate
desponding
men
whom
love
has
treated
ill
and
who
go
to
try
if
they
cannot
find
jetcomplexioned
women
more
kind
than
fair
ones
have
been
some
of
the
ladies
laughed
la
valliere
was
evidently
confused
montalais
coughed
loud
enough
to
waken
the
dead
mademoiselle
interrupted
dartagnan
you
are
in
error
when
you
speak
of
black
women
at
gigelli
the
women
there
have
not
jet
faces
it
is
true
they
are
not
whitethey
are
yellow
yellow
exclaimed
the
bevy
of
fair
beauties
eh
do
not
disparage
it
i
have
never
seen
a
finer
color
to
match
with
black
eyes
and
a
coral
mouth
so
much
the
better
for
m
de
bragelonne
said
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
with
persistent
malice
he
will
make
amends
for
his
loss
poor
fellow
a
profound
silence
followed
these
words
and
dartagnan
had
time
to
observe
and
reflect
that
womenmild
dovestreat
each
other
more
cruelly
than
tigers
but
making
la
valliere
pale
did
not
satisfy
athenais
she
determined
to
make
her
blush
likewise
resuming
the
conversation
without
pause
do
you
know
louise
said
she
that
there
is
a
great
sin
on
your
conscience
what
sin
mademoiselle
stammered
the
unfortunate
girl
looking
round
her
for
support
without
finding
it
ehwhy
continued
athenais
the
poor
young
man
was
affianced
to
you
he
loved
you
you
cast
him
off
well
that
is
a
right
which
every
honest
woman
has
said
montalais
in
an
affected
tone
when
we
know
we
cannot
constitute
the
happiness
of
a
man
it
is
much
better
to
cast
him
off
cast
him
off
or
refuse
himthats
all
very
well
said
athenais
but
that
is
not
the
sin
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
has
to
reproach
herself
with
the
actual
sin
is
sending
poor
bragelonne
to
the
wars
and
to
wars
in
which
death
is
so
very
likely
to
be
met
with
louise
pressed
her
hand
over
her
icy
brow
and
if
he
dies
continued
her
pitiless
tormentor
you
will
have
killed
him
that
is
the
sin
louise
halfdead
caught
at
the
arm
of
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
whose
face
betrayed
unusual
emotion
you
wished
to
speak
with
me
monsieur
dartagnan
said
she
in
a
voice
broken
by
anger
and
pain
what
had
you
to
say
to
me
dartagnan
made
several
steps
along
the
gallery
holding
louise
on
his
arm
then
when
they
were
far
enough
removed
from
the
otherswhat
i
had
to
say
to
you
mademoiselle
replied
he
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
has
just
expressed
roughly
and
unkindly
it
is
true
but
still
in
its
entirety
she
uttered
a
faint
cry
pierced
to
the
heart
by
this
new
wound
she
went
her
way
like
one
of
those
poor
birds
which
struck
unto
death
seek
the
shade
of
the
thicket
in
which
to
die
she
disappeared
at
one
door
at
the
moment
the
king
was
entering
by
another
the
first
glance
of
the
king
was
directed
towards
the
empty
seat
of
his
mistress
not
perceiving
la
valliere
a
frown
came
over
his
brow
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
dartagnan
who
bowed
to
himah
monsieur
cried
he
you
have
been
diligent
i
am
much
pleased
with
you
this
was
the
superlative
expression
of
royal
satisfaction
many
men
would
have
been
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
for
such
a
speech
from
the
king
the
maids
of
honor
and
the
courtiers
who
had
formed
a
respectful
circle
round
the
king
on
his
entrance
drew
back
on
observing
he
wished
to
speak
privately
with
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
the
king
led
the
way
out
of
the
gallery
after
having
again
with
his
eyes
sought
everywhere
for
la
valliere
whose
absence
he
could
not
account
for
the
moment
they
were
out
of
the
reach
of
curious
ears
well
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
the
prisoner
is
in
his
prison
sire
what
did
he
say
on
the
road
nothing
sire
what
did
he
do
there
was
a
moment
at
which
the
fishermanwho
took
me
in
his
boat
to
saintemargueriterevolted
and
did
his
best
to
kill
me
thethe
prisoner
defended
me
instead
of
attempting
to
fly
the
king
became
pale
enough
said
he
and
dartagnan
bowed
louis
walked
about
his
cabinet
with
hasty
steps
were
you
at
antibes
said
he
when
monsieur
de
beaufort
came
there
no
sire
i
was
setting
off
when
monsieur
le
duc
arrived
ah
which
was
followed
by
a
fresh
silence
whom
did
you
see
there
a
great
many
persons
said
dartagnan
coolly
the
king
perceived
he
was
unwilling
to
speak
i
have
sent
for
you
monsieur
le
capitaine
to
desire
you
to
go
and
prepare
my
lodgings
at
nantes
at
nantes
cried
dartagnan
in
bretagne
yes
sire
it
is
in
bretagne
will
you
majesty
make
so
long
a
journey
as
to
nantes
the
states
are
assembled
there
replied
the
king
i
have
two
demands
to
make
of
them
i
wish
to
be
there
when
shall
i
set
out
said
the
captain
this
eveningtomorrowtomorrow
evening
for
you
must
stand
in
need
of
rest
i
have
rested
sire
that
is
well
then
between
this
and
tomorrow
evening
when
you
please
dartagnan
bowed
as
if
to
take
his
leave
but
perceiving
the
king
very
much
embarrassed
will
you
majesty
said
he
stepping
two
paces
forward
take
the
court
with
you
certainly
i
shall
then
you
majesty
will
doubtless
want
the
musketeers
and
the
eye
of
the
king
sank
beneath
the
penetrating
glance
of
the
captain
take
a
brigade
of
them
replied
louis
is
that
all
has
your
majesty
no
other
orders
to
give
me
noahyes
i
am
all
attention
sire
at
the
castle
of
nantes
which
i
hear
is
very
ill
arranged
you
will
adopt
the
practice
of
placing
musketeers
at
the
door
of
each
of
the
principal
dignitaries
i
shall
take
with
me
of
the
principal
yes
for
instance
at
the
door
of
m
de
lyonne
yes
and
that
of
m
letellier
yes
of
m
de
brienne
yes
and
of
monsieur
le
surintendant
without
doubt
very
well
sire
by
tomorrow
i
shall
have
set
out
oh
yes
but
one
more
word
monsieur
dartagnan
at
nantes
you
will
meet
with
m
le
duc
de
gesvres
captain
of
the
guards
be
sure
that
your
musketeers
are
placed
before
his
guards
arrive
precedence
always
belongs
to
the
first
comer
yes
sire
and
if
m
de
gesvres
should
question
you
question
me
sire
is
it
likely
that
m
de
gesvres
should
question
me
and
the
musketeer
turning
cavalierly
on
his
heel
disappeared
to
nantes
said
he
to
himself
as
he
descended
from
the
stairs
why
did
he
not
dare
to
say
from
thence
to
belleisle
as
he
reached
the
great
gates
one
of
m
briennes
clerks
came
running
after
him
exclaiming
monsieur
dartagnan
i
beg
your
pardon
what
is
the
matter
monsieur
ariste
the
king
has
desired
me
to
give
you
this
order
upon
your
cashbox
asked
the
musketeer
no
monsieur
on
that
of
m
fouquet
dartagnan
was
surprised
but
he
took
the
order
which
was
in
the
kings
own
writing
and
was
for
two
hundred
pistoles
what
thought
he
after
having
politely
thanked
m
briennes
clerk
m
fouquet
is
to
pay
for
the
journey
then
mordioux
that
is
a
bit
of
pure
louis
xi
why
was
not
this
order
on
the
chest
of
m
colbert
he
would
have
paid
it
with
such
joy
and
dartagnan
faithful
to
his
principle
of
never
letting
an
order
at
sight
get
cold
went
straight
to
the
house
of
m
fouquet
to
receive
his
two
hundred
pistoles
chapter
xxxv
the
last
supper
the
superintendent
had
no
doubt
received
advice
of
the
approaching
departure
for
he
was
giving
a
farewell
dinner
to
his
friends
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
house
the
hurry
of
the
servants
bearing
dishes
and
the
diligence
of
the
registres
denoted
an
approaching
change
in
offices
and
kitchen
dartagnan
with
his
order
in
his
hand
presented
himself
at
the
offices
when
he
was
told
it
was
too
late
to
pay
cash
the
chest
was
closed
he
only
replied
on
the
kings
service
the
clerk
a
little
put
out
by
the
serious
air
of
the
captain
replied
that
that
was
a
very
respectable
reason
but
that
the
customs
of
the
house
were
respectable
likewise
and
that
in
consequence
he
begged
the
bearer
to
call
again
next
day
dartagnan
asked
if
he
could
not
see
m
fouquet
the
clerk
replied
that
m
le
surintendant
did
not
interfere
with
such
details
and
rudely
closed
the
outer
door
in
the
captains
face
but
the
latter
had
foreseen
this
stroke
and
placed
his
boot
between
the
door
and
the
doorcase
so
that
the
lock
did
not
catch
and
the
clerk
was
still
nose
to
nose
with
his
interlocutor
this
made
him
change
his
tone
and
say
with
terrified
politeness
if
monsieur
wishes
to
speak
to
m
le
surintendant
he
must
go
to
the
antechambers
these
are
the
offices
where
monseigneur
never
comes
oh
very
well
where
are
they
replied
dartagnan
on
the
other
side
of
the
court
said
the
clerk
delighted
to
be
free
dartagnan
crossed
the
court
and
fell
in
with
a
crowd
of
servants
monseigneur
sees
nobody
at
this
hour
he
was
answered
by
a
fellow
carrying
a
vermeil
dish
in
which
were
three
pheasants
and
twelve
quails
tell
him
said
the
captain
laying
hold
of
the
servant
by
the
end
of
his
dish
that
i
am
m
dartagnan
captain
of
his
majestys
musketeers
the
fellow
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
disappeared
dartagnan
following
him
slowly
he
arrived
just
in
time
to
meet
m
pelisson
in
the
antechamber
the
latter
a
little
pale
came
hastily
out
of
the
diningroom
to
learn
what
was
the
matter
dartagnan
smiled
there
is
nothing
unpleasant
monsieur
pelisson
only
a
little
order
to
receive
the
money
for
ah
said
fouquets
friend
breathing
more
freely
and
he
took
the
captain
by
the
hand
and
dragging
him
behind
him
led
him
into
the
diningroom
where
a
number
of
friends
surrounded
the
surintendant
placed
in
the
center
and
buried
in
the
cushions
of
a
fauteuil
there
were
assembled
all
the
epicureans
who
so
lately
at
vaux
had
done
the
honors
of
the
mansion
of
wit
and
money
in
aid
of
m
fouquet
joyous
friends
for
the
most
part
faithful
they
had
not
fled
their
protector
at
the
approach
of
the
storm
and
in
spite
of
the
threatening
heavens
in
spite
of
the
trembling
earth
they
remained
there
smiling
cheerful
as
devoted
in
misfortune
as
they
had
been
in
prosperity
on
the
left
of
the
surintendant
sat
madame
de
belliere
on
his
right
was
madame
fouquet
as
if
braving
the
laws
of
the
world
and
putting
all
vulgar
reasons
of
propriety
to
silence
the
two
protecting
angels
of
this
man
united
to
offer
at
the
moment
of
the
crisis
the
support
of
their
twined
arms
madame
de
belliere
was
pale
trembling
and
full
of
respectful
attentions
for
madame
la
surintendante
who
with
one
hand
on
her
husbands
was
looking
anxiously
towards
the
door
by
which
pelisson
had
gone
out
to
bring
dartagnan
the
captain
entered
at
first
full
of
courtesy
and
afterwards
of
admiration
when
with
his

glance
he
had
divined
as
well
as
taken
in
the
expression
of
every
face
fouquet
raised
himself
up
in
his
chair
pardon
me
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
if
i
did
not
myself
receive
you
when
coming
in
the
kings
name
and
he
pronounced
the
last
words
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
firmness
which
filled
the
hearts
of
all
his
friends
with
terror
monseigneur
replied
dartagnan
i
only
come
to
you
in
the
kings
name
to
demand
payment
of
an
order
for
two
hundred
pistoles
the
clouds
passed
from
every
brow
but
that
of
fouquet
which
still
remained
overcast
ah
then
said
he
perhaps
you
also
are
setting
out
for
nantes
i
do
not
know
whither
i
am
setting
out
monseigneur
but
said
madame
fouquet
recovered
from
her
fright
you
are
not
going
so
soon
monsieur
le
capitaine
as
not
to
do
us
the
honor
to
take
a
seat
with
us
madame
i
should
esteem
that
a
great
honor
done
me
but
i
am
so
pressed
for
time
that
you
see
i
have
been
obliged
to
permit
myself
to
interrupt
your
repast
to
procure
payment
of
my
note
the
reply
to
which
shall
be
gold
said
fouquet
making
a
sign
to
his
intendant
who
went
out
with
the
order
dartagnan
handed
him
oh
said
the
latter
i
was
not
uneasy
about
the
payment
the
house
is
good
a
painful
smile
passed
over
the
pale
features
of
fouquet
are
you
in
pain
asked
madame
de
belliere
do
you
feel
your
attack
coming
on
asked
madame
fouquet
neither
thank
you
both
said
fouquet
your
attack
said
dartagnan
in
his
turn
are
you
unwell
monseigneur
i
have
a
tertian
fever
which
seized
me
after
the
fete
at
vaux
caught
cold
in
the
grottos
at
night
perhaps
no
no
nothing
but
agitation
that
was
all
the
too
much
heart
you
displayed
in
your
reception
of
the
king
said
la
fontaine
quietly
without
suspicion
that
he
was
uttering
a
sacrilege
we
cannot
devote
too
much
heart
to
the
reception
of
our
king
said
fouquet
mildly
to
his
poet
monsieur
meant
to
say
the
too
great
ardor
interrupted
dartagnan
with
perfect
frankness
and
much
amenity
the
fact
is
monseigneur
that
hospitality
was
never
practiced
as
at
vaux
madame
fouquet
permitted
her
countenance
to
show
clearly
that
if
fouquet
had
conducted
himself
well
towards
the
king
the
king
had
hardly
done
the
like
to
the
minister
but
dartagnan
knew
the
terrible
secret
he
alone
with
fouquet
knew
it
those
two
men
had
not
the
one
the
courage
to
complain
the
other
the
right
to
accuse
the
captain
to
whom
the
two
hundred
pistoles
were
brought
was
about
to
take
his
leave
when
fouquet
rising
took
a
glass
of
wine
and
ordered
one
to
be
given
to
dartagnan
monsieur
said
he
to
the
health
of
the
king
whatever
may
happen
and
to
your
health
monseigneur
whatever
may
happen
said
dartagnan
he
bowed
with
these
words
of
evil
omen
to
all
the
company
who
rose
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
sound
of
his
spurs
and
boots
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
i
for
a
moment
thought
it
was
i
and
not
my
money
he
wanted
said
fouquet
endeavoring
to
laugh
you
cried
his
friends
and
what
for
in
the
name
of
heaven
oh
do
not
deceive
yourselves
my
dear
brothers
in
epicurus
said
the
superintendent
i
do
not
wish
to
make
a
comparison
between
the
most
humble
sinner
on
the
earth
and
the
god
we
adore
but
remember
he
gave
one
day
to
his
friends
a
repast
which
is
called
the
last
supper
and
which
was
nothing
but
a
farewell
dinner
like
that
which
we
are
making
at
this
moment
a
painful
cry
of
denial
arose
from
all
parts
of
the
table
shut
the
doors
said
fouquet
and
the
servants
disappeared
my
friends
continued
fouquet
lowering
his
voice
what

formerly
what

we

then
when
he
really
sinks
i
have
no
more

no
more

i
have
no

anything
but
powerful
enemies
and
powerless

cried
pelisson
since
you
explain
yourself
with
such
frankness
it
is
our

at

a
distance
said
madame

yes
i

fouquet

what
is
to

done
there
the
king
summons
me
to
the
states
i
know
well
it
is
for
the
purpose
of

me

to
refuse
to
go
would
be
to
evince
uneasiness
well
i
have
discovered
the

of
reconciling
everything
cried
pelisson
you

fouquet

at

with
an
air
of
surprise
but
with
friends

in
your

as
far
as
orleans
in
your
own
barge
as

defend
yourself
if
you

escape
if
you
are

in

you
will
carry
your

against
all

whilst
flying
you

only
have
obeyed
the

reaching
the

you

hour

to
prevent
our

added
la

intoxicated
with
fresh
projects
and
enthusiasm
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
this
concert
of
joy
and
hope
a
courier
from
the
king
said
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
a
profound
silence
immediately
ensued
as
if
the
message
brought
by
this
courier
was
nothing
but
a
reply
to
all
the
projects
given
birth
to
a
moment
before
every
one
waited
to
see
what
the
master
would
do
his
brow
was
streaming
with
perspiration
and
he
was
really
suffering
from
his
fever
at
that
instant
he
passed
into
his
cabinet
to
receive
the
kings
message
there
prevailed
as
we
have
said
such
a
silence
in
the
chambers
and
throughout
the
attendance
that
from
the
diningroom
could
be
heard
the
voice
of
fouquet
saying
that
is
well
monsieur
this
voice
was
however
broken
by
fatigue
and
trembled
with
emotion
an
instant
after
fouquet
called
gourville
who
crossed
the
gallery
amidst
the
universal
expectation
at
length
he
himself
reappeared
among
his
guests
but
it
was
no
longer
the
same
pale
spiritless
countenance
they
had
beheld
when
he
left
them
from
pale
he
had
become
livid
and
from
spiritless
annihilated
a
breathing
living
specter
he
advanced
with
his
arms
stretched
out
his
mouth
parched
like
a
shade
that
comes
to
salute
the
friends
of
former
days
on
seeing
him
thus
every
one
cried
out
and
every
one
rushed
towards
fouquet
the
latter
looking
at
pelisson
leaned
upon
his
wife
and
pressed
the
icy
hand
of
the
marquise
de
belliere
well
said
he
in
a
voice
which
had
nothing
human
in
it
what
has
happened
my
god
said
some
one
to
him
fouquet
opened
his
right
hand
which
was
clenched
but
glistening
with
perspiration
and
displayed
a
paper
upon
which
pelisson
cast
a
terrified
glance
he
read
the
following
lines
written
by
the

and
wellbeloved

we
stand
in

in
his
turn
you

the
surintendant
with
a
simplicity
that
went
to
the
heart
of
all

at

there
then
is
there
an
instant
to
be
lost
madame
fouquet
rushed
downstairs
calling
for
her

madame

flew
after

catching
her
in

ran
to

in
the

gourville
gathered
in
his

easily
explained
this
precipitate
departure
by
saying
that
an
order
from
the

had
summoned
the

to
nantes
chapter

in
m
colberts
carriage
as
gourville
had
seen
the
kings
musketeers
were
mounting
and
following
their
captain
the
latter
who
did
not
like
to
be
confined
in
his
proceedings
left
his
brigade
under
the
orders
of
a
lieutenant
and
set
off
on
post
horses
recommending
his
men
to
use
all
diligence
however
rapidly
they
might
travel
they
could
not
arrive
before
him
he
had
time
in
passing
along
the
rue
des
petitschamps
to
see
something
which
afforded
him
plenty
of
food
for
thought
and
conjecture
he
saw
m
colbert
coming
out
from
his
house
to
get
into
his
carriage
which
was
stationed
before
the
door
in
this
carriage
dartagnan
perceived
the
hoods
of
two
women
and
being
rather
curious
he
wished
to
know
the
names
of
the
ladies
hid
beneath
these
hoods
to
get
a
glimpse
at
them
for
they
kept
themselves
closely
covered
up
he
urged
his
horse
so
near
the
carriage
that
he
drove
him
against
the
step
with
such
force
as
to
shake
everything
containing
and
contained
the
terrified
women
uttered
the
one
a
faint
cry
by
which
dartagnan
recognized
a
young
woman
the
other
an
imprecation
in
which
he
recognized
the
vigor
and
aplomb
that
half
a
century
bestows
the
hoods
were
thrown
back
one
of
the
women
was
madame
vanel
the
other
the
duchesse
de
chevreuse
dartagnans
eyes
were
quicker
than
those
of
the
ladies
he
had
seen
and
known
them
whilst
they
did
not
recognize
him
and
as
they
laughed
at
their
fright
pressing
each
others
hands
humph
said
dartagnan
the
old
duchesse
is
no
more
inaccessible
to
friendship
than
formerly
she
paying
her
court
to
the
mistress
of
m
colbert
poor
m
fouquet
that
presages
you
nothing
good
he
rode
on
m
colbert
got
into
his
carriage
and
the
distinguished
trio
commenced
a
sufficiently
slow
pilgrimage
toward
the
wood
of
vincennes
madame
de
chevreuse
set
down
madame
vanel
at
her
husbands
house
and
left
alone
with
m
colbert
chatted
upon
affairs
whilst
continuing
her
ride
she
had
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
conversation
that
dear
duchesse
and
as
she
always
talked
for
the
ill
of
others
though
ever
with
a
view
to
her
own
good
her
conversation
amused
her
interlocutor
and
did
not
fail
to
leave
a
favorable
impression
she
taught
colbert
who
poor
man
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
how
great
a
minister
he
was
and
how
fouquet
would
soon
become
a
cipher
she
promised
to
rally
around
him
when
he
should
become
surintendant
all
the
old
nobility
of
the
kingdom
and
questioned
him
as
to
the
preponderance
it
would
be
proper
to
allow
la
valliere
she
praised
him
she
blamed
him
she
bewildered
him
she
showed
him
the
secret
of
so
many
secrets
that
for
a
moment
colbert
thought
he
was
doing
business
with
the
devil
she
proved
to
him
that
she
held
in
her
hand
the
colbert
of
today
as
she
had
held
the
fouquet
of
yesterday
and
as
he
asked
her
very
simply
the
reason
of
her
hatred
for
the
surintendant
why
do
you
yourself
hate
him
said
she
madame
in
politics
replied
he
the
differences
of
system
oft
bring
about
dissentions
between
men
m
fouquet
always
appeared
to
me
to
practice
a
system
opposed
to
the
true
interests
of
the
king
she
interrupted
himi
will
say
no
more
to
you
about
m
fouquet
the
journey
the
king
is
about
to
take
to
nantes
will
give
a
good
account
of
him
m
fouquet
for
me
is
a
man
gone
byand
for
you
also
colbert
made
no
reply
on
his
return
from
nantes
continued
the
duchesse
the
king
who
is
only
anxious
for
a
pretext
will
find
that
the
states
have
not
behaved
wellthat
they
have
made
too
few
sacrifices
the
states
will
say
that
the
imposts
are
too
heavy
and
that
the
surintendant
has
ruined
them
the
king
will
lay
all
the
blame
on
m
fouquet
and
then
and
then
said
colbert
oh
he
will
be
disgraced
is
not
that
your
opinion
colbert
darted
a
glance
at
the
duchesse
which
plainly
said
if
m
fouquet
be
only
disgraced
you
will
not
be
the
cause
of
it
your
place
m
colbert
the
duchesse
hastened
to
say
must
be
a
high
place
do
you
perceive
any
one
between
the
king
and
yourself
after
the
fall
of
m
fouquet
i
do
not
understand
said
he
you
will
understand
to
what
does
your
ambition
aspire
i
have
none
it
was
useless
then
to
overthrow
the
superintendent
monsieur
colbert
it
was
idle
i
had
the
honor
to
tell
you
madame
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
the
interest
of
the
kingbut
if
you
please
we
will
speak
of
your
own
mine
that
is
to
say
the
affairs
of
his
majesty
in
short
are
you
or
are
you
not
endeavoring
to
ruin
m
fouquet
answer
without
evasion
madame
i
ruin
nobody
i
am
endeavoring
to
comprehend
then
why
you
purchased
from
me
the
letters
of
m
mazarin
concerning
m
fouquet
neither
can
i
conceive
why
you
have
laid
those
letters
before
the
king
colbert
half
stupefied
looked
at
the
duchesse
with
an
air
of
constraint
madame
said
he
i
can
less
easily
conceive
how
you
who
received
the
money
can
reproach
me
on
that
head
that
is
said
the
old
duchesse
because
we
must
will
that
which
we
wish
for
unless
we
are
not
able
to
obtain
what
we
wish
will
said
colbert
quite
confounded
by
such
coarse
logic
you
are
not
able
hein
speak
i
am
not
able
i
allow
to
destroy
certain
influences
near
the
king
that
fight
in
favor
of
m
fouquet
what
are
they
stop
let
me
help
you
do
madame
la
valliere
oh
very
little
influence
no
knowledge
of
business
and
small
means
m
fouquet
has
paid
his
court
to
her
to
defend
him
would
be
to
accuse
herself
would
it
not
i
think
it
would
there
is
still
another
influence
what
do
you
say
to
that
is
it
considerable
the
queenmother
perhaps
her
majesty
the
queenmother
has
a
weakness
for
m
fouquet
very
prejudicial
to
her
son
never
believe
that
said
the
old
duchesse
smiling
oh
said
colbert
with
incredulity
i
have
often
experienced
it
formerly
very
recently
madame
at
vaux
it
was
she
who
prevented
the
king
from
having
m
fouquet
arrested
people
do
not
forever
entertain
the
same
opinions
my
dear
monsieur
that
which
the
queen
may
have
wished
recently
she
would
not
wish
perhaps
today
and
why
not
said
colbert
astonished
oh
the
reason
is
of
very
little
consequence
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
is
of
great
consequence
for
if
i
were
certain
of
not
displeasing
her
majesty
the
queenmother
my
scruples
would
be
all
removed
well
have
you
never
heard
talk
of
a
certain
secret
a
secret
call
it
what
you
like
in
short
the
queenmother
has
conceived
a
bitter
hatred
for
all
those
who
have
participated
in
one
fashion
or
another
in
the
discovery
of
this
secret
and
m
fouquet
i
believe
is
one
of
these
then
said
colbert
we
may
be
sure
of
the
assent
of
the
queenmother
i
have
just
left
her
majesty
and
she
assures
me
so
so
be
it
then
madame
but
there
is
something
further
do
you
happen
to
know
a
man
who
was
the
intimate
friend
of
m
fouquet
m
dherblay
a
bishop
i
believe
bishop
of
vannes
well
this
m
dherblay
who
also
knew
the
secret
the
queenmother
is
pursuing
with
the
utmost
rancor
indeed
so
hotly
pursued
that
if
he
were
dead
she
would
not
be
satisfied
with
anything
less
than
his
head
to
satisfy
her
he
would
never
speak
again
and
is
that
the
desire
of
the
queenmother
an
order
is
given
for
it
this
monsieur
dherblay
shall
be
sought
for
madame
oh
it
is
well
known
where
he
is
colbert
looked
at
the
duchesse
say
where
madame
he
is
at
belleileenmer
at
the
residence
of
m
fouquet
at
the
residence
of
m
fouquet
he
shall
be
taken
it
was
now
the
duchesses
turn
to
smile
do
not
fancy
the
capture
so
easy
said
she
do
not
promise
it
so
lightly
why
not
madame
because
m
dherblay
is
not
one
of
those
people
who
can
be
taken
when
and
where
you
please
he
is
a
rebel
then
oh
monsieur
colbert
we
have
passed
all
our
lives
in
making
rebels
and
yet
you
see
plainly
that
so
far
from
being
taken
we
take
others
colbert
fixed
upon
the
old
duchesse
one
of
those
fierce
looks
of
which
no
words
can
convey
the
expression
accompanied
by
a
firmness
not
altogether
wanting
in
grandeur
the
times
are
gone
said
he
in
which
subjects
gained
duchies
by
making
war
against
the
king
of
france
if
m
dherblay
conspires
he
will
perish
on
the
scaffold
that
will
give
or
will
not
give
pleasure
to
his
enemiesa
matter
by
the
way
of
little
importance
to
us
and
this
us
a
strange
word
in
the
mouth
of
colbert
made
the
duchesse
thoughtful
for
a
moment
she
caught
herself
reckoning
inwardly
with
this
mancolbert
had
regained
his
superiority
in
the
conversation
and
he
meant
to
keep
it
you
ask
me
madame
he
said
to
have
this
m
dherblay
arrested
ii
ask
you
nothing
of
the
kind
i
thought
you
did
madame
but
as
i
have
been
mistaken
we
will
leave
him
alone
the
king
has
said
nothing
about
him
the
duchesse
bit
her
nails
besides
continued
colbert
what
a
poor
capture
would
this
bishop
be
a
bishop
game
for
a
king
oh
no
no
i
will
not
even
take
the
slightest
notice
of
him
the
hatred
of
the
duchesse
now
discovered
itself
game
for
a
woman
said
she
is
not
the
queen
a
woman
if
she
wishes
m
dherblay
arrested
she
has
her
reasons
besides
is
not
m
dherblay
the
friend
of
him
who
is
doomed
to
fall
oh
never
mind
that
said
colbert
this
man
shall
be
spared
if
he
is
not
the
enemy
of
the
king
is
that
displeasing
to
you
i
say
nothing
yesyou
wish
to
see
him
in
prison
in
the
bastile
for
instance
i
believe
a
secret
better
concealed
behind
the
walls
of
the
bastile
than
behind
those
of
belleisle
i
will
speak
to
the
king
about
it
he
will
clear
up
the
point
and
whilst
waiting
for
that
enlightenment
monsieur
leveque
de
vannes
will
have
escaped
i
would
do
so
escaped
he
and
whither
should
he
escape
europe
is
ours
in
will
if
not
in
fact
he
will
always
find
an
asylum
monsieur
it
is
evident
you
know
nothing
of
the
man
you
have
to
do
with
you
do
not
know
dherblay
you
do
not
know
aramis
he
was
one
of
those
four
musketeers
who
under
the
late
king
made
cardinal
de
richelieu
tremble
and
who
during
the
regency
gave
so
much
trouble
to
monseigneur
mazarin
but
madame
what
can
he
do
unless
he
has
a
kingdom
to
back
him
he
has
one
monsieur
a
kingdom
he
what
monsieur
dherblay
i
repeat
to
you
monsieur
that
if
he
wants
a
kingdom
he
either
has
it
or
will
have
it
well
as
you
are
so
earnest
that
this
rebel
should
not
escape
madame
i
promise
you
he
shall
not
escape
belleisle
is
fortified
m
colbert
and
fortified
by
him
if
belleisle
were
also
defended
by
him
belleisle
is
not
impregnable
and
if
monsieur
leveque
de
vannes
is
shut
up
in
belleisle
well
madame
the
place
shall
be
besieged
and
he
will
be
taken
you
may
be
very
certain
monsieur
that
the
zeal
you
display
in
the
interest
of
the
queenmother
will
please
her
majesty
mightily
and
you
will
be
magnificently
rewarded
but
what
shall
i
tell
her
of
your
projects
respecting
this
man
that
when
once
taken
he
shall
be
shut
up
in
a
fortress
from
which
her
secret
shall
never
escape
very
well
monsieur
colbert
and
we
may
say
that
dating
from
this
instant
we
have
formed
a
solid
alliance
that
is
you
and
i
and
that
i
am
absolutely
at
your
service
it
is
i
madame
who
place
myself
at
yours
this
chevalier
dherblay
is
a
kind
of
spanish
spy
is
he
not
much
more
a
secret
ambassador
higher
still
stopking
phillip
iii
of
spain
is
a
bigot
he
is
perhaps
the
confessor
of
phillip
iii
you
must
go
higher
even
than
that
mordieu
cried
colbert
who
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
swear
in
the
presence
of
this
great
lady
of
this
old
friend
of
the
queenmother
he
must
then
be
the
general
of
the
jesuits
i
believe
you
have
guessed
it
at
last
replied
the
duchesse
ah
then
madame
this
man
will
ruin
us
all
if
we
do
not
ruin
him
and
we
must
make
haste
too
such
was
my
opinion
monsieur
but
i
did
not
dare
to
give
it
you
and
it
was
lucky
for
us
he
has
attacked
the
throne
and
not
us
but
mark
this
well
m
colbert
m
dherblay
is
never
discouraged
if
he
has
missed
one
blow
he
will
be
sure
to
make
another
he
will
begin
again
if
he
has
allowed
an
opportunity
to
escape
of
making
a
king
for
himself
sooner
or
later
he
will
make
another
of
whom

colbert
knitted
his
brow
with
a
menacing
expression
i
feel
assured
that
a
prison
will
settle
this
affair
for
us
madame
in
a
manner
satisfactory
for
both
the
duchesse
smiled
again
oh
if
you
knew
said
she
how
many
times
aramis
has
got
out
of
prison
oh
replied
colbert
we
will
take
care
that
he
shall
not
get
out
this
time
but
you
were
not
attending
to
what
i
said
to
you
just
now
do
you
remember
that
aramis
was
one
of
the
four
invincibles
whom
richelieu
so
dreaded
and
at
that
period
the
four
musketeers
were
not
in
possession
of
that
which
they
have
nowmoney
and
experience
colbert
bit
his
lips
we
will
renounce
the
idea
of
the
prison
said
he
in
a
lower
tone
we
will
find
a
little
retreat
from
which
the
invincible
cannot
possibly
escape
that
was
well
spoken
our
ally
replied
the
duchesse
but
it
is
getting
late
had
we
not
better
return
the
more
willingly
madame
from
my
having
my
preparations
to
make
for
setting
out
with
the
king
to
paris
cried
the
duchesse
to
the
coachman
and
the
carriage
returned
towards
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
after
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
that
gave
to
death
the
last
friend
of
fouquet

last

chapter
xxxvii
the
two
lighters
dartagnan
had
set
off
fouquet
likewise
was
gone
and
with
a
rapidity
which
doubled
the
tender
interest
of
his
friends
the
first
moments
of
this
journey
or
better
say
this
flight
were
troubled
by
a
ceaseless
dread
of
every
horse
and
carriage
to
be
seen
behind
the
fugitive
it
was
not
natural
in
fact
if
louis
xiv
was
determined
to
seize
this
prey
that
he
should
allow
it
to
escape
the
young
lion
was
already
accustomed
to
the
chase
and
he
had
bloodhounds
sufficiently
clever
to
be
trusted
but
insensibly
all
fears
were
dispersed
the
surintendant
by
hard
traveling
placed
such
a
distance
between
himself
and
his
persecutors
that
no
one
of
them
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
overtake
him
as
to
his
position
his
friends
had
made
it
excellent
for
him
was
he
not
traveling
to
join
the
king
at
nantes
and
what
did
the
rapidity
prove
but
his
zeal
to
obey
he
arrived
fatigued
but
reassured
at
orleans
where
he
found
thanks
to
the
care
of
a
courier
who
had
preceded
him
a
handsome
lighter
of
eight
oars
these
lighters
in
the
shape
of
gondolas
somewhat
wide
and
heavy
containing
a
small
chamber
covered
by
the
deck
and
a
chamber
in
the
poop
formed
by
a
tent
then
acted
as
passageboats
from
orleans
to
nantes
by
the
loire
and
this
passage
a
long
one
in
our
days
appeared
then
more
easy
and
convenient
than
the
highroad
with
its
posthacks
and
its
illhung
carriages
fouquet
went
on
board
this
lighter
which
set
out
immediately
the
rowers
knowing
they
had
the
honor
of
conveying
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
pulled
with
all
their
strength
and
that
magic
word
the
finances
promised
them
a
liberal
gratification
of
which
they
wished
to
prove
themselves
worthy
the
lighter
seemed
to
leap
the
mimic
waves
of
the
loire
magnificent
weather
a
sunrise
that
empurpled
all
the
landscape
displayed
the
river
in
all
its
limpid
serenity
the
current
and
the
rowers
carried
fouquet
along
as
wings
carry
a
bird
and
he
arrived
before
beaugency
without
the
slightest
accident
having
signalized
the
voyage
fouquet
hoped
to
be
the
first
to
arrive
at
nantes
there
he
would
see
the
notables
and
gain
support
among
the
principal
members
of
the
states
he
would
make
himself
a
necessity
a
thing
very
easy
for
a
man
of
his
merit
and
would
delay
the
catastrophe
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
avoiding
it
entirely
besides
said
gourville
to
him
at
nantes
you
will
make
out
or
we
will
make
out
the
intentions
of
your
enemies
we
will
have
horses
always
ready
to
convey
you
to
poitou
a
bark
in
which
to
gain
the
sea
and
when
once
upon
the
open
sea
belleisle
is
your
inviolable
port
you
see
besides
that
no
one
is
watching
you
no
one
is
following
he
had
scarcely
finished
when
they
discovered
at
a
distance
behind
an
elbow
formed
by
the
river
the
masts
of
a
huge
lighter
coming
down
the
rowers
of
fouquets
boat
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
on
seeing
this
galley
what
is
the
matter
asked
fouquet
the
matter
is
monseigneur
replied
the
patron
of
the
bark
that
it
is
a
truly
remarkable
thingthat
lighter
comes
along
like
a
hurricane
gourville
started
and
mounted
to
the
deck
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
fouquet
did
not
go
up
with
him
but
said
to
gourville
with
restrained
mistrust
see
what
it
is
dear
friend
the
lighter
had
just
passed
the
elbow
it
came
on
so
fast
that
behind
it
might
be
plainly
seen
the
white
wake
illumined
with
the
fires
of
the
day
how
they
go
repeated
the
skipper
how
they
go
they
must
be
well
paid
i
did
not
think
he
added
that
oars
of
wood
could
behave
better
than
ours
but
yonder
oarsmen
prove
the
contrary
well
they
may
said
one
of
the
rowers
they
are
twelve
and
we
but
eight
twelve
rowers
replied
gourville
twelve
impossible
the
number
of
eight
rowers
for
a
lighter
had
never
been
exceeded
even
for
the
king
this
honor
had
been
paid
to
monsieur
le
surintendant
more
for
the
sake
of
haste
than
of
respect
what
does
it
mean
said
gourville
endeavoring
to
distinguish
beneath
the
tent
which
was
already
apparent
travelers
which
the
most
piercing
eye
could
not
yet
have
succeeded
in
discovering
they
must
be
in
a
hurry
for
it
is
not
the
king
said
the
patron
fouquet
shuddered
by
what
sign
do
you
know
that
it
is
not
the
king
said
gourville
in
the
first
place
because
there
is
no
white
flag
with
fleursdelis
which
the
royal
lighter
always
carries
and
then
said
fouquet
because
it
is
impossible
it
should
be
the
king
gourville
as
the
king
was
still
in
paris
yesterday
gourville
replied
to
the
surintendant
by
a
look
which
said
you
were
there
yourself
yesterday
and
by
what
sign
do
you
make
out
they
are
in
such
haste
added
he
for
the
sake
of
gaining
time
by
this
monsieur
said
the
patron
these
people
must
have
set
out
a
long
while
after
us
and
they
have
already
nearly
overtaken
us
bah
said
gourville
who
told
you
that
they
do
not
come
from
beaugency
or
from
moit
even
we
have
seen
no
lighter
of
that
shape
except
at
orleans
it
comes
from
orleans
monsieur
and
makes
great
haste
fouquet
and
gourville
exchanged
a
glance
the
captain
remarked
their
uneasiness
and
to
mislead
him
gourville
immediately
said
some
friend
who
has
laid
a
wager
he
would
catch
us
let
us
win
the
wager
and
not
allow
him
to
come
up
with
us
the
patron
opened
his
mouth
to
say
that
it
was
quite
impossible
but
fouquet
said
with
much
hauteurif
it
is
any
one
who
wishes
to
overtake
us
let
him
come
we
can
try
monseigneur
said
the
man
timidly
come
you
fellows
put
out
your
strength
row
row
no
said
fouquet
on
the
contrary
stop
short
monseigneur
what
folly
interrupted
gourville
stooping
towards
his
ear
pull
up
repeated
fouquet
the
eight
oars
stopped
and
resisting
the
water
created
a
retrograde
motion
it
stopped
the
twelve
rowers
in
the
other
did
not
at
first
perceive
this
maneuver
for
they
continued
to
urge
on
their
boat
so
vigorously
that
it
arrived
quickly
within
musketshot
fouquet
was
shortsighted
gourville
was
annoyed
by
the
sun
now
full
in
his
eyes
the
skipper
alone
with
that
habit
and
clearness
which
are
acquired
by
a
constant
struggle
with
the
elements
perceived
distinctly
the
travelers
in
the
neighboring
lighter
i
can
see
them
cried
he
there
are
two
i
can
see
nothing
said
gourville
you
will
not
be
long
before
you
distinguish
them
in
twenty
strokes
of
their
oars
they
will
be
within
ten
paces
of
us
but
what
the
patron
announced
was
not
realized
the
lighter
imitated
the
movement
commanded
by
fouquet
and
instead
of
coming
to
join
its
pretended
friends
it
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
river
i
cannot
comprehend
this
said
the
captain
nor
i
cried
gourville
you
who
can
see
so
plainly
the
people
in
that
lighter
resumed
fouquet
try
to
describe
them
to
us
before
we
are
too
far
off
i
thought
i
saw
two
replied
the
boatman
i
can
only
see
one
now
under
the
tent
what
sort
of
man
is
he
he
is
a
dark
man
broadshouldered
bullnecked
a
little
cloud
at
that
moment
passed
across
the
azure
darkening
the
sun
gourville
who
was
still
looking
with
one
hand
over
his
eyes
became
able
to
see
what
he
sought
and
all
at
once
jumping
from
the
deck
into
the
chamber
where
fouquet
awaited
him
colbert
said
he
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
colbert
repeated
fouquet
too
strange
but
no
it
is
impossible
i
tell
you
i
recognized
him
and
he
at
the
same
time
so
plainly
recognized
me
that
he
is
just
gone
into
the
chamber
on
the
poop
perhaps
the
king
has
sent
him
on
our
track
in
that
case
he
would
join
us
instead
of
lying
by
what
is
he
doing
there
he
is
watching
us
without
a
doubt
i
do
not
like
uncertainty
said
fouquet
let
us
go
straight
up
to
him
oh
monseigneur
do
not
do
that
the
lighter
is
full
of
armed
men
he
wishes
to
arrest
me
then
gourville
why
does
he
not
come
on
monseigneur
it
is
not
consistent
with
your
dignity
to
go
to
meet
even
your
ruin
but
to
allow
them
to
watch
me
like
a
malefactor
nothing
yet
proves
that
they
are
watching
you
monseigneur
be
patient
what
is
to
be
done
then
do
not
stop
you
were
only
going
so
fast
to
appear
to
obey
the
kings
order
with
zeal
redouble
the
speed
he
who
lives
will
see
that
is
better
come
cried
fouquet
since
they
remain
stockstill
yonder
let
us
go
on
the
captain
gave
the
signal
and
fouquets
rowers
resumed
their
task
with
all
the
success
that
could
be
looked
for
from
men
who
had
rested
scarcely
had
the
lighter
made
a
hundred
fathoms
than
the
other
that
with
the
twelve
rowers
resumed
its
rapid
course
this
position
lasted
all
day
without
any
increase
or
diminution
of
distance
between
the
two
vessels
towards
evening
fouquet
wished
to
try
the
intentions
of
his
persecutor
he
ordered
his
rowers
to
pull
towards
the
shore
as
if
to
effect
a
landing
colberts
lighter
imitated
this
maneuver
and
steered
towards
the
shore
in
a
slanting
direction
by
the
merest
chance
at
the
spot
where
fouquet
pretended
to
wish
to
land
a
stableman
from
the
chateau
of
langeais
was
following
the
flowery
banks
leading
three
horses
in
halters
without
doubt
the
people
of
the
twelveoared
lighter
fancied
that
fouquet
was
directing
his
course
to
these
horses
ready
for
flight
for
four
or
five
men
armed
with
muskets
jumped
from
the
lighter
on
to
the
shore
and
marched
along
the
banks
as
if
to
gain
ground
on
the
horseman
fouquet
satisfied
of
having
forced
the
enemy
to
a
demonstration
considered
his
intention
evident
and
put
his
boat
in
motion
again
colberts
people
returned
likewise
to
theirs
and
the
course
of
the
two
vessels
was
resumed
with
fresh
perseverance
upon
seeing
this
fouquet
felt
himself
threatened
closely
and
in
a
prophetic
voicewell
gourville
said
he
whisperingly
what
did
i
say
at
our
last
repast
at
my
house
am
i
going
or
not
to
my
ruin
oh
monseigneur
these
two
boats
which
follow
each
other
with
so
much
emulation
as
if
we
were
disputing
m
colbert
and
i
a
prize
for
swiftness
on
the
loire
do
they
not
aptly
represent
our
fortunes
and
do
you
not
believe
gourville
that

uncertainty
you
are
about
to
appear
at
the

you
are
about
to
show
what
sort
of
man
you
are
your
eloquence
and
genius
for

oh
let
m

look
to
it
well
for
his
lighter

as
much
exposed
as
yours

being
upset

go
quickly

faster
than

it
is
true
we
shall

he
everything

remember
the
proverb

come
first
served
well
m
colbert
takes
care
not
to
pass
me
he
is
a
prudent

m
colbert
he
was
right
the
two
lighters
held
their
course
as
far
as
nantes
watching
each
other
when
the
surintendant
landed
gourville
hoped
he
should
be
able
to
seek
refuge
at
once
and
have
the
relays
prepared
but
at
the
landing
the
second
lighter
joined
the
first
and
colbert
approaching
fouquet
saluted
him
on
the
quay
with
marks
of
the
profoundest
respectmarks
so
significant
so
public
that
their
result
was
the
bringing
of
the
whole
population
upon
la
fosse
fouquet
was
completely
selfpossessed
he
felt
that
in
his
last
moments
of
greatness
he
had
obligations
towards
himself
he
wished
to
fall
from
such
a
height
that
his
fall
should
crush
some
of
his
enemies
colbert
was
thereso
much
the
worse
for
colbert
the
surintendant
therefore
coming
up
to
him
replied
with
that
arrogant
semiclosure
of
the
eyes
peculiar
to
himwhat
is
that
you
m
colbert
to
offer
you
my
respects
monseigneur
said
the
latter
were
you
in
that
lighterpointing
to
the
one
with
twelve
rowers
yes
monseigneur
of
twelve
rowers
said
fouquet
what
luxury
m
colbert
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
was
the
queenmother
monseigneurand
colbert
blushed
this
is
a
voyage
that
will
cost
those
who
have
to
pay
for
it
dear
monsieur
lintendant
said
fouquet
but
you
have
happily
arrivedyou
see
however
added
he
a
moment
after
that
i
who
had
but
eight
rowers
arrived
before
you
and
he
turned
his
back
towards
him
leaving
him
uncertain
whether
the
maneuvers
of
the
second
lighter
had
escaped
the
notice
of
the
first
at
least
he
did
not
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
showing
that
he
had
been
frightened
colbert
so
annoyingly
attacked
did
not
give
way
i
have
not
been
quick
monseigneur
he
replied
because
i
followed
your
example
whenever
you
stopped
and
why
did
you
do
that
monsieur
colbert
cried
fouquet
irritated
by
the
base
audacity
as
you
had
a
superior
crew
to
mine
why
did
you
not
either
join
me
or
pass
me
out
of
respect
said
the
intendant
bowing
to
the
ground
fouquet
got
into
a
carriage
which
the
city
had
sent
to
him
we
know
not
why
or
how
and
he
repaired
to
la
maison
de
nantes
escorted
by
a
vast
crowd
of
people
who
for
several
days
had
been
agog
with
expectation
of
a
convocation
of
the
states
scarcely
was
he
installed
when
gourville
went
out
to
order
horses
on
the
route
to
poitiers
and
vannes
and
a
boat
at
paimboef
he
performed
these
various
operations
with
so
much
mystery
activity
and
generosity
that
never
was
fouquet
then
laboring
under
an
attack
of
fever
more
nearly
saved
except
for
the
counteraction
of
that
immense
disturber
of
human
projectschance
a
report
was
spread
during
the
night
that
the
king
was
coming
in
great
haste
on
post
horses
and
would
arrive
in
ten
or
twelve
hours
at
the
latest
the
people
while
waiting
for
the
king
were
greatly
rejoiced
to
see
the
musketeers
newly
arrived
with
monsieur
dartagnan
their
captain
and
quartered
in
the
castle
of
which
they
occupied
all
the
posts
in
quality
of
guard
of
honor
m
dartagnan
who
was
very
polite
presented
himself
about
ten
oclock
at
the
lodgings
of
the
surintendant
to
pay
his
respectful
compliments
and
although
the
minister
suffered
from
fever
although
he
was
in
such
pain
as
to
be
bathed
in
sweat
he
would
receive
m
dartagnan
who
was
delighted
with
that
honor
as
will
be
seen
by
the
conversation
they
had
together
chapter
xxxviii
friendly
advice
fouquet
had
gone
to
bed
like
a
man
who
clings
to
life
and
wishes
to
economize
as
much
as
possible
that
slender
tissue
of
existence
of
which
the
shocks
and
frictions
of
this
world
so
quickly
wear
out
the
tenuity
dartagnan
appeared
at
the
door
of
this
chamber
and
was
saluted
by
the
superintendent
with
a
very
affable
good
day
bon
jour
monseigneur
replied
the
musketeer
how
did
you
get
through
the
journey
tolerably
well
thank
you
and
the
fever
but
poorly
i
drink
as
you
perceive
i
am
scarcely
arrived
and
i
have
already
levied
a
contribution
of
tisane
upon
nantes
you
should
sleep
first
monseigneur
eh
corbleu
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
i
should
be
very
glad
to
sleep
who
hinders
you
why
you
in
the
first
place
i
oh
monseigneur
no
doubt
you
do
is
it
at
nantes
as
at
paris
do
you
not
come
in
the
kings
name
for
heavens
sake
monseigneur
replied
the
captain
leave
the
king
alone
the
day
on
which
i
shall
come
on
the
part
of
the
king
for
the
purpose
you
mean
take
my
word
for
it
i
will
not
leave
you
long
in
doubt
you
will
see
me
place
my
hand
on
my
sword
according
to
the
ordonnance
and
you
will
hear
my
say
at
once
in
ceremonial
voice
monseigneur
in
the
name
of
the
king
i
arrest
you
you
promise
me
that
frankness
said
the
superintendent
upon
my
honor
but
we
have
not
come
to
that
believe
me
what
makes
you
think
that
m
dartagnan
for
my
part
i
think
quite
the
contrary
i
have
heard
speak
of
nothing
of
the
kind
replied
dartagnan
eh
eh
said
fouquet
indeed
no
you
are
an
agreeable
man
in
spite
of
your
fever
the
king
should
not
cannot
help
loving
you
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
fouquets
expression
implied
doubt
but
m
colbert
said
he
does
m
colbert
love
me
as
much
as
you
say
i
am
not
speaking
of
m
colbert
replied
dartagnan
he
is
an
exceptional
man
he
does
not
love
you
so
much
is
very
possible
but
mordioux
the
squirrel
can
guard
himself
against
the
adder
with
very
little
trouble
do
you
know
that
you
are
speaking
to
me
quite
as
a
friend
replied
fouquet
and
that
upon
my
life
i
have
never
met
with
a
man
of
your
intelligence
and
heart
you
are
pleased
to
say
so
replied
dartagnan
why
did
you
wait
till
today
to
pay
me
such
a
compliment
blind
that
we
are
murmured
fouquet
your
voice
is
getting
hoarse
said
dartagnan
drink
monseigneur
drink
and
he
offered
him
a
cup
of
tisane
with
the
most
friendly
cordiality
fouquet
took
it
and
thanked
him
by
a
gentle
smile
such
things
only
happen
to
me
said
the
musketeer
i
have
passed
ten
years
under
your
very
beard
while
you
were
rolling
about
tons
of
gold
you
were
clearing
an
annual
pension
of
four
millions
you
never
observed
me
and
you
find
out
there
is
such
a
person
in
the
world
just
at
the
moment
you
just
at
the
moment
i
am
about
to
fall
interrupted
fouquet
that
is
true
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
i
did
not
say
so
but
you
thought
so
and
that
is
the
same
thing
well
if
i
fall
take
my
word
as
truth
i
shall
not
pass
a
single
day
without
saying
to
myself
as
i
strike
my
brow
fool
foolstupid
mortal
you
had
a
monsieur
dartagnan
under
your
eye
and
hand
and
you
did
not
employ
him
you
did
not
enrich
him
you
overwhelm
me
said
the
captain
i
esteem
you
greatly
there
exists
another
man
then
who
does
not
think
as
m
colbert
thinks
said
the
surintendant
how
this
m
colbert
looms
up
in
your
imagination
he
is
worse
than
fever
oh
i
have
good
cause
said
fouquet
judge
for
yourself
and
he
related
the
details
of
the
course
of
the
lighters
and
the
hypocritical
persecution
of
colbert
is
not
this
a
clear
sign
of
my
ruin
dartagnan
became
very
serious
that
is
true
he
said
yes
it
has
an
unsavory
odor
as
m
de
treville
used
to
say
and
he
fixed
on
m
fouquet
his
intelligent
and
significant
look
am
i
not
clearly
designated
in
that
captain
is
not
the
king
bringing
me
to
nantes
to
get
me
away
from
paris
where
i
have
so
many
creatures
and
to
possess
himself
of
belleisle
where
m
dherblay
is
added
dartagnan
fouquet
raised
his
head
as
for
me
monseigneur
continued
dartagnan
i
can
assure
you
the
king
has
said
nothing
to
me
against
you
indeed
the
king
commanded
me
to
set
out
for
nantes
it
is
true
and
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
m
de
gesvres
my
friend
to
m
de
gesvres
yes
monseigneur
continued
the
musketeer
whose
eye
s
did
not
cease
to
speak
a
language
different
from
the
language
of
his
lips
the
king
moreover
commanded
me
to
take
a
brigade
of
musketeers
which
is
apparently
superfluous
as
the
country
is
quite
quiet
a
brigade
said
fouquet
raising
himself
upon
his
elbow
ninetysix
horsemen
yes
monseigneur
the
same
number
as
were
employed
in
arresting
mm
de
chalais
de
cinqmars
and
montmorency
fouquet
pricked
up
his
ears
at
these
words
pronounced
without
apparent
value
and
what
else
said
he
oh
nothing
but
insignificant
orders
such
as
guarding
the
castle
guarding
every
lodging
allowing
none
of
m
de
gesvress
guards
to
occupy
a
single
post
and
as
to
myself
cried
fouquet
what
orders
had
you
as
to
you
monseigneurnot
the
smallest
word
monsieur
dartagnan
my
safety
my
honor
perhaps
my
life
are
at
stake
you
would
not
deceive
me
ito
what
end
are
you
threatened
only
there
really
is
an
order
with
respect
to
carriages
and
boats
an
order
yes
but
it
cannot
concern
youa
simple
measure
of
police
what
is
it
captainwhat
is
it
to
forbid
all
horses
or
boats
to
leave
nantes
without
a
pass
signed
by
the
king
great
god
but
dartagnan
began
to
laugh
all
that
is
not
to
be
put
into
execution
before
the
arrival
of
the
king
at
nantes
so
that
you
see
plainly
monseigneur
the
order
in
nowise
concerns
you
fouquet
became
thoughtful
and
dartagnan
feigned
not
to
observe
his
preoccupation
it
is
evident
by
my
thus
confiding
to
you
the
orders
which
have
been
given
to
me
that
i
am
friendly
towards
you
and
that
i
am
trying
to
prove
to
you
that
none
of
them
are
directed
against
you
without
doubtwithout
doubt
said
fouquet
still
absent
let
us
recapitulate
said
the
captain
his
glance
beaming
with
earnestness
a
special
guard
about
the
castle
in
which
your
lodging
is
to
be
is
it
not
do
you
know
the
castle
ah
monseigneur
a
regular
prison
the
absence
of
m
de
gesvres
who
has
the
honor
of
being
one
of
your
friends
the
closing
of
the
gates
of
the
city
and
of
the
river
without
a
pass
but
only
when
the
king
shall
have
arrived
please
to
observe
monsieur
fouquet
that
if
instead
of
speaking
to
man
like
you
who
are
one
of
the
first
in
the
kingdom
i
were
speaking
to
a
troubled
uneasy
consciencei
should
compromise
myself
forever
what
a
fine
opportunity
for
any
one
who
wished
to
be
free
no
police
no
guards
no
orders
the
water
free
the
roads
free
monsieur
dartagnan
obliged
to
lend
his
horses
if
required
all
this
ought
to
reassure
you
monsieur
fouquet
for
the
king
would
not
have
left
me
thus
independent
if
he
had
any
sinister
designs
in
truth
monsieur
fouquet
ask
me
whatever
you
like
i
am
at
your
service
and
in
return
if
you
will

with
a
profound
bow
the
musketeer
whose
looks
had
lost
none
of
their
intelligent
kindness
left
the
apartment
he
had
not
reached
the
steps
of
the
vestibule
when
fouquet
quite
beside
himself
hung
to
the
bellrope
and
shouted
my
horsesmy
lighter
but
nobody
answered
the
surintendant
dressed
himself
with
everything
that
came
to
hand

cried
he
while
slipping
his
watch
into
his
pocket
and
the
bell
sounded
again
whilst

repeated

breathless
and
pale

cried
fouquet
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
it
is
too
late
said
the
surintendants
poor
friend
too
latewhy
listen
and
they
heard
the
sounds
of
trumpets
and
drums
in
front
of
the
castle
what
does
that
mean
gourville
it
means
the
king
is
come
monseigneur
the
king
the
king
who
has
ridden
double
stages
who
has
killed
horses
and
who
is
eight
hours
in
advance
of
all
our
calculations
we
are
lost
murmured
fouquet
brave
dartagnan
all
is
over
thou
has
spoken
to
me
too
late
the
king
in
fact
was
entering
the
city
which
soon
resounded
with
the
cannon
from
the
ramparts
and
from
a
vessel
which
replied
from
the
lower
parts
of
the
river
fouquets
brow
darkened
he
called
his
valets
de
chambre
and
dressed
in
ceremonial
costume
from
his
window
behind
the
curtains
he
could
see
the
eagerness
of
the
people
and
the
movement
of
a
large
troop
which
had
followed
the
prince
the
king
was
conducted
to
the
castle
with
great
pomp
and
fouquet
saw
him
dismount
under
the
portcullis
and
say
something
in
the
ear
of
dartagnan
who
held
his
stirrup
dartagnan
when
the
king
had
passed
under
the
arch
directed
his
steps
towards
the
house
fouquet
was
in
but
so
slowly
and
stopping
so
frequently
to
speak
to
his
musketeers
drawn
up
like
a
hedge
that
it
might
be
said
he
was
counting
the
seconds
or
the
steps
before
accomplishing
his
object
fouquet
opened
the
window
to
speak
to
him
in
the
court
ah
cried
dartagnan
on
perceiving
him
are
you
still
there
monseigneur
and
that
word
still
completed
the
proof
to
fouquet
of
how
much
information
and
how
many
useful
counsels
were
contained
in
the
first
visit
the
musketeer
had
paid
him
the
surintendant
sighed
deeply
good
heavens
yes
monsieur
replied
he
the
arrival
of
the
king
has
interrupted
me
in
the
projects
i
had
formed
oh
then
you
know
that
the
king
has
arrived
yes
monsieur
i
have
seen
him
and
this
time
you
come
from
him
to
inquire
after
you
monseigneur
and
if
your
health
is
not
too
bad
to
beg
you
to
have
the
kindness
to
repair
to
the
castle
directly
monsieur
dartagnan
directly
ah
mordioux
said
the
captain
now
the
king
is

there
is
no
more
walking

more

now
you
as
much
as
me

as
much
as
you
fouquet
heaved
a
last
sigh
climbed
with
difficulty
into
his
carriage
so
great
was
his
weakness
and
went
to
the
castle
escorted
by
dartagnan
whose
politeness
was
not
less
terrifying
this
time
than
it
had
just
before
been
consoling
and

chapter
xxxix
how
the
king
louis
xiv
played
his
little
part
as
fouquet
was
alighting
from
his
carriage
to
enter
the
castle
of
nantes
a
man
of
mean
appearance
went
up
to
him
with
marks
of
the
greatest
respect
and
gave
him
a
letter
dartagnan
endeavored
to
prevent
this
man
from
speaking
to
fouquet
and
pushed
him
away
but
the
message
had
been
given
to
the
surintendant
fouquet
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
and
instantly
a
vague
terror
which
dartagnan
did
not
fail
to
penetrate
was
painted
on
the
countenance
of
the
first
minister
fouquet
put
the
paper
into
the
portfolio
which
he
had
under
his
arm
and
passed
on
towards
the
kings
apartments
dartagnan
through
the
small
windows
made
at
every
landing
of
the
donjon
stairs
saw
as
he
went
up
behind
fouquet
the
man
who
had
delivered
the
note
looking
round
him
on
the
place
and
making
signs
to
several
persons
who
disappeared
in
the
adjacent
streets
after
having
themselves
repeated
the
signals
fouquet
was
made
to
wait
for
a
moment
on
the
terrace
of
which
we
have
spokena
terrace
which
abutted
on
the
little
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
the
cabinet
of
the
king
was
located
here
dartagnan
passed
on
before
the
surintendant
whom
till
that
time
he
had
respectfully
accompanied
and
entered
the
royal
cabinet
well
asked
louis
xiv
who
on
perceiving
him
threw
on
to
the
table
covered
with
papers
a
large
green
cloth
the
order
is
executed
sire
and
fouquet
monsieur
le
surintendant
follows
me
said
dartagnan
in
ten
minutes
let
him
be
introduced
said
the
king
dismissing
dartagnan
again
with
a
gesture
the
latter
retired
but
had
scarcely
reached
the
corridor
at
the
extremity
of
which
fouquet
was
waiting
for
him
when
he
was
recalled
by
the
kings
bell
did
he
not
appear
astonished
asked
the
king
who
sire
fouquet
replied
the
king
without
saying
monsieur
a
peculiarity
which
confirmed
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
in
his
suspicions
no
sire
replied
he
thats
well
and
a
second
time
louis
dismissed
dartagnan
fouquet
had
not
quitted
the
terrace
where
he
had
been
left
by
his
guide
he
reperused
his
note
conceived
thus
something
is
being
contrived
against
you
perhaps
they
will
not
dare
to
carry
it
out
at
the
castle
it
will
be
on
your
return
home
the
house
is
already
surrounded
by
musketeers
do
not
enter
a
white
horse
is
in
waiting
for
you
behind
the
esplanade
fouquet
recognized
the
writing
and
zeal
of
gourville
not
being
willing
that
if
any
evil
happened
to
himself
this
paper
should
compromise
a
faithful
friend
the
surintendant
was
busy
tearing
it
into
a
thousand
morsels
spread
about
by
the
wind
from
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
dartagnan
found
him
watching
the
snowflake
fluttering
of
the
last
scraps
in
space
monsieur
said
he
the
king
awaits
you
fouquet
walked
with
a
deliberate
step
along
the
little
corridor
where
mm
de
brienne
and
rose
were
at
work
whilst
the
duc
de
saintaignan
seated
on
a
chair
likewise
in
the
corridor
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
orders
with
feverish
impatience
his
sword
between
his
legs
it
appeared
strange
to
fouquet
that
mm
brienne
rose
and
de
saintaignan
in
general
so
attentive
and
obsequious
should
scarcely
take
the
least
notice
as
he
the
surintendant
passed
but
how
could
he
expect
to
find
it
otherwise
among
courtiers
he
whom
the
king
no
longer
called
anything
but
fouquet
he
raised
his
head
determined
to
look
every
one
and
everything
bravely
in
the
face
and
entered
the
kings
apartment
where
a
little
bell
which
we
already
know
had
already
announced
him
to
his
majesty
the
king
without
rising
nodded
to
him
and
with
interest
well
how
are
you
monsieur
fouquet
said
he
i
am
in
a
high
fever
replied
the
surintendant
but
i
am
at
the
kings
service
that
is
well
the
states
assemble
tomorrow
have
you
a
speech
ready
fouquet
looked
at
the
king
with
astonishment
i
have
not
sire
replied
he
but
i
will
improvise
one
i
am
too
well
acquainted
with
affairs
to
feel
any
embarrassment
i
have
only
one
question
to
ask
will
your
majesty
permit
me
certainly
ask
it
why
did
not
your
majesty
do
his
first
minister
the
honor
of
giving
him
notice
of
this
in
paris
you
were
ill
i
was
not
willing
to
fatigue
you
never
did
a
labornever
did
an
explanation
fatigue
me
sire
and
since
the
moment
is
come
for
me
to
demand
an
explanation
of
my
king
oh
monsieur
fouquet
an
explanation
an
explanation
pray
of
what
of
your
majestys
intentions
with
respect
to
myself
the
king
blushed
i
have
been
calumniated
continued
fouquet
warmly
and
i
feel
called
upon
to
adjure
the
justice
of
the
king
to
make
inquiries
you
say
all
this
to
me
very
uselessly
monsieur
fouquet
i
know
what
i
know
your
majesty
can
only
know
the
things
that
have
been
told
to
you
and
i
on
my
part
have
said
nothing
to
you
whilst
others
have
spoken
many
many
times
what
do
you
wish
to
say
said
the
king
impatient
to
put
an
end
to
this
embarrassing
conversation
i
will
go
straight
to
the
facts
sire
and
i
accuse
a
certain
man
of
having
injured
me
in
your
majestys
opinion
nobody
has
injured
you
monsieur
fouquet
that
reply
proves
to
me
sire
that
i
am
right
monsieur
fouquet
i
do
not
like
people
to
be
accused
not
when
one
is
accused
we
have
already
spoken
too
much
about
this
affair
your
majesty
will
not
allow
me
to
justify
myself
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
accuse
you
fouquet
with
a
halfbow
made
a
step
backward
it
is
certain
thought
he
that
he
has
made
up
his
mind
he
alone
who
cannot
go
back
can
show
such
obstinacy
not
to
see
the
danger
now
would
be
to
be
blind
indeed
not
to
shun
it
would
be
stupid
he
resumed
aloud
did
your
majesty
send
for
me
on
business
no
monsieur
fouquet
but
for
some
advice
i
wish
to
give
you
i
respectfully
await
it
sire
rest
yourself
monsieur
fouquet
do
not
throw
away
your
strength
the
session
of
the
states
will
be
short
and
when
my
secretaries
shall
have
closed
it
i
do
not
wish
business
to
be
talked
of
in
france
for
a
fortnight
has
the
king
nothing
to
say
to
me
on
the
subject
of
this
assembly
of
the
states
no
monsieur
fouquet
not
to
me
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
rest
yourself
i
beg
you
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
fouquet
bit
his
lips
and
hung
his
head
he
was
evidently
busy
with
some
uneasy
thought
this
uneasiness
struck
the
king
are
you
angry
at
having
to
rest
yourself
m
fouquet
said
he
yes
sire
i
am
not
accustomed
to
take
rest
but
you
are
ill
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
your
majesty
spoke
just
now
of
a
speech
to
be
pronounced
tomorrow
his
majesty
made
no
reply
this
unexpected
stroke
embarrassed
him
fouquet
felt
the
weight
of
this
hesitation
he
thought
he
could
read
danger
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
prince
which
fear
would
but
precipitate
if
i
appear
frightened
i
am
lost
thought
he
the
king
on
his
part
was
only
uneasy
at
the
alarm
of
fouquet
has
he
a
suspicion
of
anything
murmured
he
if
his
first
word
is
severe
again
thought
fouquet
if
he
becomes
angry
or
feigns
to
be
angry
for
the
sake
of
a
pretext
how
shall
i
extricate
myself
let
us
smooth
the
declivity
a
little
gourville
was
right
sire
said
he
suddenly
since
the
goodness
of
the
king
watches
over
my
health
to
the
point
of
dispensing
with
my
labor
may
i
not
be
allowed
to
be
absent
from
the
council
of
tomorrow
i
could
pass
the
day
in
bed
and
will
entreat
the
king
to
grant
me
his
physician
that
we
may
endeavor
to
find
a
remedy
against
this
fearful
fever
so
be
it
monsieur
fouquet
it
shall
be
as
you
desire
you
shall
have
a
holiday
tomorrow
you
shall
have
the
physician
and
shall
be
restored
to
health
thanks
said
fouquet
bowing
then
opening
his
game
shall
i
not
have
the
happiness
of
conducting
your
majesty
to
my
residence
of
belleisle
and
he
looked
louis
full
in
the
face
to
judge
of
the
effect
of
such
a
proposal
the
king
blushed
again
do
you
know
replied
he
endeavoring
to
smile
that
you
have
just
said
my
residence
of
belleisle
yes
sire
well
do
you
not
remember
continued
the
king
in
the
same
cheerful
tone
that
you
gave
me
belleisle
that
is
true
again
sire
only
as
you
have
not
taken
it
you
will
doubtless
come
with
me
and
take
possession
of
it
i
mean
to
do
so
that
was
besides
your
majestys
intention
as
well
as
mine
and
i
cannot
express
to
your
majesty
how
happy
and
proud
i
have
been
to
see
all
the
kings
regiments
from
paris
to
help
take
possession
the
king
stammered
out
that
he
did
not
bring
the
musketeers
for
that
alone
oh
i
am
convinced
of
that
said
fouquet
warmly
your
majesty
knows
very
well
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
come
alone
with
a
cane
in
your
hand
to
bring
to
the
ground
all
the
fortifications
of
belleisle
peste
cried
the
king
i
do
not
wish
those
fine
fortifications
which
cost
so
much
to
build
to
fall
at
all
no
let
them
stand
against
the
dutch
and
english
you
would
not
guess
what
i
want
to
see
at
belleisle
monsieur
fouquet
it
is
the
pretty
peasants
and
women
of
the
lands
on
the
seashore
who
dance
so
well
and
are
so
seducing
with
their
scarlet
petticoats
i
have
heard
great
boast
of
your
pretty
tenants
monsieur
le
surintendant
well
let
me
have
a
sight
of
them
whenever
your
majesty
pleases
have
you
any
means
of
transport
it
shall
be
tomorrow
if
you
like
the
surintendant
felt
this
stroke
which
was
not
adroit
and
replied
no
sire
i
was
ignorant
of
your
majestys
wish
above
all
i
was
ignorant
of
your
haste
to
see
belleisle
and
i
am
prepared
with
nothing
you
have
a
boat
of
your
own
nevertheless
i
have
five
but
they
are
all
in
port
or
at
paimboeuf
and
to
join
them
or
bring
them
hither
would
require
at
least
twentyfour
hours
have
i
any
occasion
to
send
a
courier
must
i
do
so
wait
a
little
put
an
end
to
the
feverwait
till
tomorrow
that
is
true
who
knows
but
that
by
tomorrow
we
may
not
have
a
hundred
other
ideas
replied
fouquet
now
perfectly
convinced
and
very
pale
the
king
started
and
stretched
his
hand
out
towards
his
little
bell
but
fouquet
prevented
his
ringing
sire
said
he
i
have
an
aguei
am
trembling
with
cold
if
i
remain
a
moment
longer
i
shall
most
likely
faint
i
request
your
majestys
permission
to
go
and
fling
myself
beneath
the
bedclothes
indeed
you
are
in
a
shiver
it
is
painful
to
behold
come
monsieur
fouquet
begone
i
will
send
to
inquire
after
you
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
with
kindness
in
an
hour
i
shall
be
better
i
will
call
some
one
to
reconduct
you
said
the
king
as
you
please
sire
i
would
gladly
take
the
arm
of
any
one
monsieur
dartagnan
cried
the
king
ringing
his
little
bell
oh
sire
interrupted
fouquet
laughing
in
such
a
manner
as
made
the
prince
feel
cold
would
you
give
me
the
captain
of
your
musketeers
to
take
me
to
my
lodgings
an
equivocal
honor
that
sire
a
simple
footman
i
beg
and
why
m
fouquet
m
dartagnan
conducts
me
often
and
extremely
well
yes
but
when
he
conducts
you
sire
it
is
to
obey
you
whilst
me
go
on
if
i
am
obliged
to
return
home
supported
by
the
leader
of
the
musketeers
it
would
be
everywhere
said
you
had
had
me
arrested
arrested
replied
the
king
who
became
paler
than
fouquet
himselfarrested
oh
and
why
should
they
not
say
so
continued
fouquet
still
laughing
and
i
would
lay
a
wager
there
would
be
people
found
wicked
enough
to
laugh
at
it
this
sally
disconcerted
the
monarch
fouquet
was
skillful
enough
or
fortunate
enough
to
make
louis
xiv
recoil
before
the
appearance
of
the
deed
he
meditated
m
dartagnan
when
he
appeared
received
an
order
to
desire
a
musketeer
to
accompany
the
surintendant
quite
unnecessary
said
the
latter
sword
for
sword
i
prefer
gourville
who
is
waiting
for
me
below
but
that
will
not
prevent
me
enjoying
the
society
of
m
dartagnan
i
am
glad
he
will
see
belleisle
he
is
so
good
a
judge
of
fortifications
dartagnan
bowed
without
at
all
comprehending
what
was
going
on
fouquet
bowed
again
and
left
the
apartment
affecting
all
the
slowness
of
a
man
who
walks
with
difficulty
when
once
out
of
the
castle
i
am
saved
said
he
oh
yes
disloyal
king
you
shall
see
belleisle
but
it
shall
be
when
i
am
no
longer
there
he
disappeared
leaving
dartagnan
with
the
king
captain
said
the
king
you
will
follow
m
fouquet
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
yes
sire
he
is
going
to
his
lodgings
again
you
will
go
with
him
yes
sire
you
will
arrest
him
in
my
name
and
will
shut
him
up
in
a
carriage
in
a
carriage
well
sire
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
may
not
on
the
road
either
converse
with
any
one
or
throw
notes
to
people
he
may
meet
that
will
be
rather
difficult
sire
not
at
all
pardon
me
sire
i
cannot
stifle
m
fouquet
and
if
he
asks
for
liberty
to
breathe
i
cannot
prevent
him
by
closing
both
the
windows
and
the
blinds
he
will
throw
out
at
the
doors
all
the
cries
and
notes
possible
the
case
is
provided
for
monsieur
dartagnan
a
carriage
with
a
trellis
will
obviate
both
the
difficulties
you
point
out
a
carriage
with
an
iron
trellis
cried
dartagnan
but
a
carriage
with
an
iron
trellis
is
not
made
in
half
an
hour
and
your
majesty
commands
me
to
go
immediately
to
m
fouquets
lodgings
the
carriage
in
question
is
already
made
ah
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
said
the
captain
if
the
carriage
is
ready
made
very
well
then
we
have
only
to
set
it
in
motion
it
is
readyand
the
horses
harnessed
ah
and
the
coachman
with
the
outriders
is
waiting
in
the
lower
court
of
the
castle
dartagnan
bowed
there
only
remains
for
me
to
ask
your
majesty
whither
i
shall
conduct
m
fouquet
to
the
castle
of
angers
at
first
very
well
sire
afterwards
we
will
see
yes
sire
monsieur
dartagnan
one
last
word
you
have
remarked
that
for
making
this
capture
of
m
fouquet
i
have
not
employed
my
guards
on
which
account
m
de
gesvres
will
be
furious
your
majesty
does
not
employ
your
guards
said
the
captain
a
little
humiliated
because
you
mistrust
m
de
gesvres
that
is
all
that
is
to
say
monsieur
that
i
have
more
confidence
in
you
i
know
that
very
well
sire
and
it
is
of
no
use
to
make
so
much
of
it
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
arriving
at
this
monsieur
that
if
from
this
moment
it
should
happen
that
by
any
chance
whatever
m
fouquet
should
escapesuch
chances
have
been
monsieur
oh
very
often
sire
but
for
others
not
for
me
and
why
not
with
you
because
i
sire
have
for
an
instant
wished
to
save
m
fouquet
the
king
started
because
continued
the
captain
i
had
then
a
right
to
do
so
having
guessed
your
majestys
plan
without
you
having
spoken
to
me
of
it
and
that
i
took
an
interest
in
m
fouquet
now
was
i
not
at
liberty
to
show
my
interest
in
this
man
in
truth
monsieur
you
do
not
reassure
me
with
regard
to
your
services
if
i
had
saved
him
then
i
should
have
been
perfectly
innocent
i
will
say
more
i
should
have
done
well
for
m
fouquet
is
not
a
bad
man
but
he
was
not
willing
his
destiny
prevailed
he
let
the
hour
of
liberty
slip
by
so
much
the
worse
now
i
have
orders
i
will
obey
those
orders
and
m
fouquet
you
may
consider
as
a
man
arrested
he
is
at
the
castle
of
angers
this
very
m
fouquet
oh
you
have
not
got
him
yet
captain
that
concerns
me
every
one
to
his
trade
sire
only
once
more
reflect
do
you
seriously
give
me
orders
to
arrest
m
fouquet
sire
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
in
writing
sire
then
here
is
the
order
dartagnan
read
it
bowed
to
the
king
and
left
the
room
from
the
height
of
the
terrace
he
perceived
gourville
who
went
by
with
a
joyous
air
towards
the
lodgings
of
m
fouquet
chapter
xl
the
white
horse
and
the
black
that
is
rather
surprising
said
dartagnan
gourville
running
about
the
streets
so
gayly
when
he
is
almost
certain
that
m
fouquet
is
in
danger
when
it
is
almost
equally
certain
that
it
was
gourville
who
warned
m
fouquet
just
now
by
the
note
which
was
torn
into
a
thousand
pieces
upon
the
terrace
and
given
to
the
winds
by
monsieur
le
surintendant
gourville
is
rubbing
his
hands
that
is
because
he
has
done
something
clever
whence
comes
m
gourville
gourville
is
coming
from
the
rue
aux
herbes
whither
does
the
rue
aux
herbes
lead
and
dartagnan
followed
along
the
tops
of
the
houses
of
nantes
dominated
by
the
castle
the
line
traced
by
the
streets
as
he
would
have
done
upon
a
topographical
plan
only
instead
of
the
dead
flat
paper
the
living
chart
rose
in
relief
with
the
cries
the
movements
and
the
shadows
of
men
and
things
beyond
the
inclosure
of
the
city
the
great
verdant
plains
stretched
out
bordering
the
loire
and
appeared
to
run
towards
the
pink
horizon
which
was
cut
by
the
azure
of
the
waters
and
the
dark
green
of
the
marshes
immediately
outside
the
gates
of
nantes
two
white
roads
were
seen
diverging
like
separate
fingers
of
a
gigantic
hand
dartagnan
who
had
taken
in
all
the
panorama
at
a
glance
by
crossing
the
terrace
was
led
by
the
line
of
the
rue
aux
herbes
to
the
mouth
of
one
of
those
roads
which
took
its
rise
under
the
gates
of
nantes
one
step
more
and
he
was
about
to
descend
the
stairs
take
his
trellised
carriage
and
go
towards
the
lodgings
of
m
fouquet
but
chance
decreed
at
the
moment
of
plunging
into
the
staircase
that
he
was
attracted
by
a
moving
point
then
gaining
ground
upon
that
road
what
is
that
said
the
musketeer
to
himself
a
horse
gallopinga
runaway

no
doubt
what
a
rate
he
is
going
at
the
moving
point
became
detached
from
the
road
and
entered
into
the
fields
a
white
horse
continued
the
captain
who
had
just
observed
the
color
thrown
luminously
against
the
dark
ground
and
he
is
mounted
it
must
be
some
boy
whose
horse
is
thirsty
and
has
run
away
with
him
these
reflections
rapid
as
lightning
simultaneous
with
visual
perception
dartagnan
had
already
forgotten
when
he
descended
the
first
steps
of
the
staircase
some
morsels
of
paper
were
spread
over
the
stairs
and
shone
out
white
against
the
dirty
stones
eh
eh
said
the
captain
to
himself
here
are
some
of
the
fragments
of
the
note
torn
by
m
fouquet
poor
man
he
has
given
his
secret
to
the
wind
the
wind
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
and
brings
it
back
to
the
king
decidedly

dartagnan
picked
up
one
of
these
morsels
of
paper
as
he
descended
gourvilles
pretty
little
hand
cried
he
whilst
examining
one
of
the
fragments
of
the
note
i
was
not
mistaken
and
he
read
the
word
horse
stop
said
he
and
he
examined
another
upon
which
there
was
not
a
letter
traced
upon
a
third
he
read
the
word
white
white
horse
repeated
he
like
a
child
that
is
spelling
ah
mordioux
cried
the
suspicious
spirit
a
white
horse
and
like
that
grain
of
powder
which
burning
dilates
into
ten
thousand
times
its
volume
dartagnan
enlightened
by
ideas
and
suspicions
rapidly
reascended
the
stairs
towards
the
terrace
the
white
horse
was
still
galloping
in
the
direction
of
the
loire
at
the
extremity
of
which
melting
into
the
vapors
of
the
water
a
little
sail
appeared

oh
cried
the
musketeer
only
a
man
who
wants
to
fly
would
go
at
that
pace
across
plowed
lands
there
is
but
one
fouquet
a
financier
to
ride
thus
in
open
day
upon
a
white
horse
there
is
no
one
but
the
lord
of
belleisle
who
would
make
his
escape
towards
the
sea
while
there
are
such
thick
forests
on
land
and
there
is
but
one
dartagnan
in

who
will
have
gained
his
boat
within

this

said
the
musketeer
gave
orders
that
the
carriage
with
the
iron
trellis
should
be
taken
immediately
to
a
thicket
situated
just
outside
the
city
he
selected
his
best
horse
jumped
upon
his
back
galloped
along
the
rue
aux
herbes
taking
not
the
road
fouquet
had
taken
but
the
bank
itself
of
the
loire
certain
that
he
should
gain
ten
minutes
upon
the
total
distance
and
at
the
intersection
of
the
two
lines
come
up
with
the
fugitive
who
could
have
no
suspicion
of
being
pursued
in
that
direction
in
the
rapidity
of
the
pursuit
and
with
the
impatience
of
the
avenger
animating
himself
as
in
war
dartagnan
so
mild
so
kind
towards
fouquet
was
surprised
to
find
himself
become
ferociousalmost
sanguinary
for
a
long
time
he
galloped
without
catching
sight
of
the
white
horse
his
rage
assumed
fury
he
doubted
himselfhe
suspected
that
fouquet
had
buried
himself
in
some
subterranean
road
or
that
he
had
changed
the
white
horse
for
one
of
those
famous
black
ones
as
swift
as
the
wind
which
dartagnan
at
saintmande
had
so
frequently
admired
and
envied
for
their
vigor
and
their
fleetness
at
such
moments
when
the
wind
cut
his
eyes
so
as
to
make
the
tears
spring
from
them
when
the
saddle
had
become
burning
hot
when
the
galled
and
spurred
horse
reared
with
pain
and
threw
behind
him
a
shower
of
dust
and
stones
dartagnan
raising
himself
in
his
stirrups
and
seeing
nothing
on
the
waters
nothing
beneath
the
trees
looked
up
into
the
air
like
a
madman
he
was
losing
his
senses
in
the
paroxysms
of
eagerness
he
dreamt
of
aerial
waysthe
discovery
of
the
following
century
he
called
to
his
mind
daedalus
and
the
vast
wings
that
had
saved
him
from
the
prisons
of
crete
a
hoarse
sigh
broke
from
his
lips
as
he
repeated
devoured
by
the
fear
of
ridicule
i
i
duped
by
a
gourville
i
they
will
say
that
i
am
growing
oldthey
will
say
i
have
received
a
million
to
allow
fouquet
to
escape
and
he
again
dug
his
spurs
into
the
sides
of
his
horse
he
had
ridden
astonishingly
fast
suddenly
at
the
extremity
of
some
open
pastureground
behind
the
hedges
he
saw
a
white
form
which
showed
itself
disappeared
and
at
last
remained
distinctly
visible
against
the
rising
ground
dartagnans
heart
leaped
with
joy
he
wiped
the
streaming
sweat
from
his
brow
relaxed
the
tension
of
his
kneesby
which
the
horse
breathed
more
freelyand
gathering
up
his
reins
moderated
the
speed
of
the
vigorous
animal
his
active
accomplice
on
this
manhunt
he
had
then
time
to
study
the
direction
of
the
road
and
his
position
with
regard
to
fouquet
the
superintendent
had
completely
winded
his
horse
by
crossing
the
soft
ground
he
felt
the
necessity
of
gaining
a
firmer
footing
and
turned
towards
the
road
by
the
shortest
secant
line
dartagnan
on
his
part
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
ride
straight
on
concealed
by
the
sloping
shore
so
that
he
would
cut
his
quarry
off
the
road
when
he
came
up
with
him
then
the
real
race
would
beginthen
the
struggle
would
be
in
earnest
dartagnan
gave
his
horse
good
breathingtime
he
observed
that
the
superintendent
had
relaxed
into
a
trot
which
was
to
say
he
too
was
favoring
his
horse
but
both
of
them
were
too
much
pressed
for
time
to
allow
them
to
continue
long
at
that
pace
the
white
horse
sprang
off
like
an
arrow
the
moment
his
feet
touched
firm
ground
dartagnan
dropped
his
head
and
his
black
horse
broke
into
a
gallop
both
followed
the
same
route
the
quadruple
echoes
of
this
new
racecourse
were
confounded
fouquet
had
not
yet
perceived
dartagnan
but
on
issuing
from
the
slope
a
single
echo
struck
the
air
it
was
that
of
the
steps
of
dartagnans
horse
which
rolled
along
like
thunder
fouquet
turned
round
and
saw
behind
him
within
a
hundred
paces
his
enemy
bent
over
the
neck
of
his
horse
there
could
be
no
doubtthe
shining
baldrick
the
red
cassockit
was
a
musketeer
fouquet
slackened
his
hand
likewise
and
the
white
horse
placed
twenty
feet
more
between
his
adversary
and
himself
oh
but
thought
dartagnan
becoming
very
anxious
that
is
not
a
common
horse
m
fouquet
is
uponlet
us
see
and
he
attentively
examined
with
his
infallible
eye
the
shape
and
capabilities
of
the
courser
round
full
quartersa
thin
long
taillarge
hocksthin
legs
as
dry
as
bars
of
steelhoofs
hard
as
marble
he
spurred
his
own
but
the
distance
between
the
two
remained
the
same
dartagnan
listened
attentively
not
a
breath
of
the
horse
reached
him
and
yet
he
seemed
to
cut
the
air
the
black
horse
on
the
contrary
began
to
puff
like
any
blacksmiths
bellows
i
must
overtake
him
if
i
kill
my
horse
thought
the
musketeer
and
he
began
to
saw
the
mouth
of
the
poor
animal
whilst
he
buried
the
rowels
of
his
merciless
spurs
into
his
sides
the
maddened
horse
gained
twenty
toises
and
came
up
within
pistolshot
of
fouquet
courage
said
the
musketeer
to
himself
courage
the
white
horse
will
perhaps
grow
weaker
and
if
the
horse
does
not
fall
the
master
must
pull
up
at
last
but
horse
and
rider
remained
upright
together
gaining
ground
by
difficult
degrees
dartagnan
uttered
a
wild
cry
which
made
fouquet
turn
round
and
added
speed
to
the
white
horse
a
famous
horse
a
mad
rider
growled
the
captain
hola
mordioux
monsieur
fouquet
stop
in
the
kings
name
fouquet
made
no
reply
do
you
hear
me
shouted
dartagnan
whose
horse
had
just
stumbled
pardieu
replied
fouquet
laconically
and
rode
on
faster
dartagnan
was
nearly
mad
the
blood
rushed
boiling
to
his
temples
and
his
eyes
in
the
kings
name
cried
he
again
stop
or
i
will
bring
you
down
with
a
pistolshot
do
replied
fouquet
without
relaxing
his
speed
dartagnan
seized
a
pistol
and
cocked
it
hoping
that
the
double
click
of
the
spring
would
stop
his
enemy
you
have
pistols
likewise
said
he
turn
and
defend
yourself
fouquet
did
turn
round
at
the
noise
and
looking
dartagnan
full
in
the
face
opened
with
his
right
hand
the
part
of
his
dress
which
concealed
his
body
but
he
did
not
even
touch
his
holsters
there
were
not
more
than
twenty
paces
between
the
two
mordioux
said
dartagnan
i
will
not
assassinate
you
if
you
will
not
fire
upon

what
is
a
prison
i
would
rather
die
replied
fouquet
i
shall
suffer
less
dartagnan
drunk
with
despair
hurled
his
pistol
to
the
ground
i
will
take
you
alive
said
he
and
by
a
prodigy
of
skill
which
this
incomparable
horseman
alone
was
capable
he
threw
his
horse
forward
to
within
ten
paces
of
the
white
horse
already
his
hand
was
stretched
out
to
seize
his
prey
kill
me
kill
me
cried
fouquet
twould
be
more
humane
no
alivealive
murmured
the
captain
at
this
moment
his
horse
made
a
false
step
for
the
second
time
and
fouquets
again
took
the
lead
it
was
an
unheardof
spectacle
this
race
between
two
horses
which
now
only
kept
alive
by
the
will
of
their
riders
it
might
be
said
that
dartagnan
rode
carrying
his
horse
along
between
his
knees
to
the
furious
gallop
had
succeeded
the
fast
trot
and
that
had
sunk
to
what
might
be
scarcely
called
a
trot
at
all
but
the
chase
appeared
equally
warm
in
the
two
fatigued
athletoe
dartagnan
quite
in
despair
seized
his
second
pistol
and
cocked
it
at
your
horse
not
at
you
cried
he
to
fouquet
and
he
fired
the
animal
was
hit
in
the
quartershe
made
a
furious
bound
and
plunged
forward
at
that
moment
dartagnans
horse
fell
dead
i
am
dishonored
thought
the
musketeer
i
am
a
miserable
wretch
for
pitys
sake
m
fouquet
throw
me
one
of
your
pistols
that
i
may
blow
out
my
brains
but
fouquet
rode
away
for
mercys
sake
for
mercys
sake
cried
dartagnan
that
which
you
will
not
do
at
this
moment
i
myself
will
do
within
an
hour
but
here
upon
this
road
i
should
die
bravely
i
should
die
esteemed
do
me
that
service
m
fouquet
m
fouquet
made
no
reply
but
continued
to
trot
on
dartagnan
began
to
run
after
his
enemy
successively
he
threw
away
his
hat
his
coat
which
embarrassed
him
and
then
the
sheath
of
his
sword
which
got
between
his
legs
as
he
was
running
the
sword
in
his
hand
itself
became
too
heavy
and
he
threw
it
after
the
sheath
the
white
horse
began
to
rattle
in
its
throat
dartagnan
gained
upon
him
from
a
trot
the
exhausted
animal
sunk
to
a
staggering
walkthe
foam
from
his
mouth
was
mixed
with
blood
dartagnan
made
a
desperate
effort
sprang
towards
fouquet
and
seized
him
by
the
leg
saying
in
a
broken
breathless
voice
i
arrest
you
in
the
kings
name
blow
my
brains
out
if
you
like
we
have
both
done
our
duty
fouquet
hurled
far
from
him
into
the
river
the
two
pistols
dartagnan
might
have
seized
and
dismounting
from
his
horsei
am
your
prisoner
monsieur
said
he
will
you
take
my
arm
for
i
see
you
are
ready
to
faint
thanks
murmured
dartagnan
who
in
fact
felt
the
earth
sliding
from
under
his
feet
and
the
light
of
day
turning
to
blackness
around
him
then
he
rolled
upon
the
sand
without
breath
or
strength
fouquet
hastened
to
the
brink
of
the
river
dipped
some
water
in
his
hat
with
which
he
bathed
the
temples
of
the
musketeer
and
introduced
a
few
drop
between
his
lips
dartagnan
raised
himself
with
difficulty
and
looked
about
him
with
a
wandering
eye
he
beheld
fouquet
on
his
knees
with
his
wet
hat
in
his
hand
smiling
upon
him
with
ineffable
sweetness
you
are
not
off
then
cried
he
oh
monsieur
the
true
king
of
royalty
in
heart
in
soul
is
not
louis
of
the
louvre
or
philippe
of
saintemarguerite
it
is
you
proscribed
condemned
i
who
this
day
am
ruined
by
a
single
error
m
dartagnan
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
is
that
i
should
have
had
you
for
a
friend
but
how
shall
we
return
to
nantes
we
are
a
great
way
from
it
that
is
true
said
dartagnan
gloomily
the
white
horse
will
recover
perhaps
he
is
a
good
horse
mount
monsieur
dartagnan
i
will
walk
till
you
have
rested
a
little
poor
beast
and
wounded
too
said
the
musketeer
he
will
go
i
tell
you
i
know
him
but
we
can
do
better
still
let
us
both
get
up
and
ride
slowly
we
can
try
said
the
captain
but
they
had
scarcely
charged
the
animal
with
this
double
load
when
he
began
to
stagger
and
then
with
a
great
effort
walked
a
few
minutes
then
staggered
again
and
sank
down
dead
by
the
side
of
the
black
horse
which
he
had
just
managed
to
come
up
to
we
will
go
on
footdestiny
wills
it
sothe
walk
will
be
pleasant
said
fouquet
passing
his
arm
through
that
of
dartagnan
mordioux
cried
the
latter
with
a
fixed
eye
a
contracted
brow
and
a
swelling
heartwhat
a
disgraceful
day
they
walked
slowly
the
four
leagues
which
separated
them
from
the
little
wood
behind
which
the
carriage
and
escort
were
in
waiting
when
fouquet
perceived
that
sinister
machine
he
said
to
dartagnan
who
cast
down
his
eyes
ashamed
of
louis
xiv
there
is
an
idea
that
did
not

it
was
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
king
full
of
impatience
went
to
his
cabinet
on
the
terrace
and
kept
opening
the
door
of
the
corridor
to
see
what
his
secretaries
were
doing
m
colbert
seated
in
the
same
place
m
de
saintaignan
had
so
long
occupied
in
the
morning
was
chatting
in
a
low
voice
with
m
de
brienne
the
king
opened
the
door
suddenly
and
addressed
them
what
is
it
you
are
saying
we
were
speaking
of
the
first
sitting
of
the
states
said
m
de
brienne
rising
very
well
replied
the
king
and
returned
to
his
room
five
minutes
after
the
summons
of
the
bell
recalled

whose
hour
it
was
have
you
finished
your
copies
asked
the
king
not
yet
sire
see
if
m
dartagnan
has
returned
not
yet

it
is
very
strange
murmured
the
king
call
m
colbert
colbert
entered
he
had
been
expecting
this
all
the
morning
monsieur
colbert
said
the
king
very
sharply
you
must
ascertain
what
has
become
of
m
dartagnan
colbert
in
his
calm
voice
replied
where
does
your
majesty
desire
him
to
be
sought
for
eh
monsieur
do
you
not
know
on
what
i
have
sent
him
replied
louis
acrimoniously
your
majesty
did
not
inform
me
monsieur
there
are
things
that
must
be
guessed
and
you
above
all
are
apt
to
guess
them
i
might
have
been
able
to
imagine
sire
but
i
do
not
presume
to
be
positive
colbert
had
not
finished
these
words
when
a
rougher
voice
than
that
of
the
king
interrupted
the
interesting
conversation
thus
begun
between
the
monarch
and
his
clerk
dartagnan
cried
the
king
with
evident
joy
dartagnan
pale
and
in
evidently
bad
humor
cried
to
the
king
as
he
entered
sire
is
it
your
majesty
who
has
given
orders
to
my
musketeers
what
orders
said
the
king
about
m
fouquets
house
none
replied
louis
ha
said
dartagnan
biting
his
mustache
i
was
not
mistaken
then
it
was
monsieur
here
and
he
pointed
to
colbert
what
orders
let
me
know
said
the
king
orders
to
turn
the
house
topsyturvy
to
beat
m
fouquets
servants
to
force
the
drawers
to
give
over
a
peaceful
house
to
pillage

these
are
savage
orders
monsieur
said
colbert
turning
pale
monsieur
interrupted
dartagnan
the
king
alone
understandthe
king
alone
has
a
right
to
command
my
musketeers
but
as
to
you
i
forbid
you
to
do
it
and
i
tell
you
so
before
his
majesty
gentlemen
who
carry
swords
do
not
sling
pens
behind
their
ears
dartagnan
dartagnan
murmured
the
king
it
is
humiliating
continued
the
musketeer
my
soldiers
are
disgraced
i
do
not
command
reitres
thank
you
nor
clerks
of

but
what
is
all
this
about

the
king
with
authority
about
this

who
could
not
guess
your
majestys
orders

consequently
could
not

to
arrest

under
the
pretense
of
securing
the

papers
they
have
taken
away
the
furniture
my

have
been
posted
round
the
house
all
the
morning
such
were
my
orders
why
did
any
one
presume
to
order
them
to
enter
why
by
forcing
them
to
assist
in
this
pillage
have
they
been
made

monsieur
dartagnan
said
the
king
sternly
take
care
it
is
not
in
my
presence
that
such
explanations
and
made
in
such
a
tone
should
take
place
i
have
acted
for
the
good
of
the
king
said
colbert
in
a
faltering
voice
it
is
hard
to
be
so
treated
by
one
of
your
majestys
officers
and
that
without
redress
on
account
of
the
respect
i
owe
the
king
the
respect
you
owe
the
king
cried
dartagnan
his
eyes
flashing
fire
consists
in
the
first
place
in
making
his
authority
respected
and
his
person
beloved
every
agent
of
a
power
without
control
represents
that
power
and
when
people
curse
the
hand
which
strikes
them
it
is
the
royal
hand
that
god
reproaches
do
you
hear
must
a
soldier
hardened
by
forty
years
of
wounds
and
blood
give
you
this
lesson
monsieur
must
mercy
be
on
my
side
and
ferocity
on
yours
you
have
caused
the
innocent
to
be
arrested
bound
and
imprisoned
accomplices
perhaps
of
m
fouquet
said
colbert
who
told
you
m
fouquet
had
accomplices
or
even
that
he
was
guilty
the
king
alone
knows
that
his
justice
is
not
blind
when
he
says
arrest
and
imprison
such
and
such
a
man
he
is
obeyed
do
not
talk
to
me
then
any
more
of
the
respect
you
owe
the
king
and
be
careful
of
your
words
that
they
may
not
chance
to
convey
the
slightest
menace
for
the
king
will
not
allow
those
to
be
threatened
who
do
him
service
by
others
who
do
him
disservice
and
if
in
case
i
should
have
which
god
forbid
a
master
so
ungrateful
i
would
make
myself
respected
thus
saying
dartagnan
took
his
station
haughtily
in
the
kings
cabinet
his
eyes
flashing
his
hand
on
his
sword
his
lips
trembling
affecting
much
more
anger
than
he
really
felt
colbert
humiliated
and
devoured
with
rage
bowed
to
the
king
as
if
to
ask
his
permission
to
leave
the
room
the
king
thwarted
alike
in
pride
and
in
curiosity
knew
not
which
part
to
take
dartagnan
saw
him
hesitate
to
remain
longer
would
have
been
a
mistake
it
was
necessary
to
score
a
triumph
over
colbert
and
the
only
method
was
to
touch
the
king
so
near
the
quick
that
his
majesty
would
have
no
other
means
of
extrication
but
choosing
between
the
two
antagonists
dartagnan
bowed
as
colbert
had
done
but
the
king
who
in
preference
to
everything
else
was
anxious
to
have
all
the
exact
details
of
the
arrest
of
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
from
him
who
had
made
him
tremble
for
a
momentthe
king
perceiving
that
the
illhumor
of
dartagnan
would
put
off
for
half
an
hour
at
least
the
details
he
was
burning
to
be
acquainted
withlouis
we
say
forgot
colbert
who
had
nothing
new
to
tell
him
and
recalled
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
in
the
first
place
said
he
let
me
see
the
result
of
your
commission
monsieur
you
may
rest
yourself
hereafter
dartagnan
who
was
just
passing
through
the
doorway
stopped
at
the
voice
of
the
king
retraced
his
steps
and
colbert
was
forced
to
leave
the
closet
his
countenance
assumed
almost
a
purple
hue
his
black
and
threatening
eyes
shone
with
a
dark
fire
beneath
their
thick
brows
he
stepped
out
bowed
before
the
king
half
drew
himself
up
in
passing
dartagnan
and
went
away
with
death
in
his
heart
dartagnan
on
being
left
alone
with
the
king
softened
immediately
and
composing
his
countenance
sire
said
he
you
are
a
young
king
it
is
by
the
dawn
that
people
judge
whether
the
day
will
be
fine
or
dull
how
sire
will
the
people
whom
the
hand
of
god
has
placed
under
your
law
argue
of
your
reign
if
between
them
and
you
you
allow
angry
and
violent
ministers
to
interpose
their
mischief
but
let
us
speak
of
myself
sire
let
us
leave
a
discussion
that
may
appear
idle
and
perhaps
inconvenient
to
you
let
us
speak
of
myself
i
have
arrested
m
fouquet
you
took
plenty
of
time
about
it
said
the
king
sharply
dartagnan
looked
at
the
king
i
perceive
that
i
have
expressed
myself
badly
i
announced
to
your
majesty
that
i
had
arrested
monsieur
fouquet
you
did
and
what
then
well
i
ought
to
have
told
your
majesty
that
m
fouquet
had
arrested
me
that
would
have
been
more
just
i
reestablish
the
truth
then
i
have
been
arrested
by
m
fouquet
it
was
now
the
turn
of
louis
xiv
to
be
surprised
his
majesty
was
astonished
in
his
turn
dartagnan
with
his
quick
glance
appreciated
what
was
passing
in
the
heart
of
his
master
he
did
not
allow
him
time
to
put
any
questions
he
related
with
that
poetry
that
picturesqueness
which
perhaps
he
alone
possessed
at
that
period
the
escape
of
fouquet
the
pursuit
the
furious
race
and
lastly
the
inimitable
generosity
of
the
surintendant
who
might
have
fled
ten
times
over
who
might
have
killed
the
adversary
in
the
pursuit
but
who
had
preferred
imprisonment
perhaps
worse
to
the
humiliation
of
one
who
wished
to
rob
him
of
his
liberty
in
proportion
as
the
tale
advanced
the
king
became
agitated
devouring
the
narrators
words
and
drumming
with
his
fingernails
upon
the
table
it
results
from
all
this
sire
in
my
eyes
at
least
that
the
man
who
conducts
himself
thus
is
a
gallant
man
and
cannot
be
an
enemy
to
the
king
that
is
my
opinion
and
i
repeat
it
to
your
majesty
i
know
what
the
king
will
say
to
me
and
i
bow
to
itreasons
of
state
so
be
it
to
my
ears
that
sounds
highly
respectable
but
i
am
a
soldier
and
i
have
received
my
orders
my
orders
are
executedvery
unwillingly
on
my
part
it
is
true
but
they
are
executed
i
say
no
more
where
is
m
fouquet
at
this
moment
asked
louis
after
a
short
silence
m
fouquet
sire
replied
dartagnan
is
in
the
iron
cage
that
m
colbert
had
prepared
for
him
and
is
galloping
as
fast
as
four
strong
horses
can
drag
him
towards
angers
why
did
you
leave
him
on
the
road
because
your
majesty
did
not
tell
me
to
go
to
angers
the
proof
the
best
proof
of
what
i
advance
is
that
the
king
desired
me
to
be
sought
for
but
this
minute
and
then
i
had
another
reason
what
is
that
whilst
i
was
with
him
poor
m
fouquet
would
never
attempt
to
escape
well
cried
the
king
astonished
your
majesty
ought
to
understand
and
does
understand
certainly
that
my
warmest
wish
is
to
know
that
m
fouquet
is
at
liberty
i
have
given
him
one
of
my
brigadiers
the
most
stupid
i
could
find
among
my
musketeers
in
order
that
the
prisoner
might
have
a
chance
of
escaping
are
you
mad
monsieur
dartagnan
cried
the
king
crossing
his
arms
on
his
breast
do
people
utter
such
enormities
even
when
they
have
the
misfortune
to
think
them
ah
sire
you
cannot
expect
that
i
should
be
an
enemy
to
m
fouquet
after
what
he
has
just
done
for
you
and
me
no
no
if
you
desire
that
he
should
remain
under
your
lock
and
bolt
never
give
him
in
charge
to
me
however
closely
wired
might
be
the
cage
the
bird
would
in
the
end
take
wing
i
am
surprised
said
the
king
in
his
sternest
tone
you
did
not
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
man
m
fouquet
wished
to
place
upon
my
throne
you
had
in
him
all
you
wantaffection
gratitude
in
my
service
monsieur
you
will
only
find
a
master
if
m
fouquet
had
not
gone
to
seek
you
in
the
bastile
sire
replied
dartagnan
with
a
deeply
impressive
manner
one
single
man
would
have
gone
there
and
i
should
have
been
that
manyou
know
that
right
well
sire
the
king
was
brought
to
a
pause
before
that
speech
of
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
so
frankly
spoken
and
so
true
the
king
had
nothing
to
offer
on
hearing
dartagnan
louis
remembered
the
dartagnan
of
former
times
him
who
at
the
palais
royal
held
himself
concealed
behind
the
curtains
of
his
bed
when
the
people
of
paris
led
by
cardinal
de
retz
came
to
assure
themselves
of
the
presence
of
the
king
the
dartagnan
whom
he
saluted
with
his
hand
at
the
door
of
his
carriage
when
repairing
to
notre
dame
on
his
return
to
paris
the
soldier
who
had
quitted
his
service
at
blois
the
lieutenant
he
had
recalled
to
be
beside
his
person
when
the
death
of
mazarin
restored
his
power
the
man
he
had
always
found
loyal
courageous
devoted
louis
advanced
towards
the
door
and
called
colbert
colbert
had
not
left
the
corridor
where
the
secretaries
were
at
work
he
reappeared
colbert
did
you
make
a
perquisition
on
the
house
of
m
fouquet
yes
sire
what
has
it
produced
m
de
roncherolles
who
was
sent
with
your
majestys
musketeers
has
remitted
me
some
papers
replied
colbert
i
will
look
at
them
give
me
your
hand
my
hand
sire
yes
that
i
may
place
it
in
that
of
m
dartagnan
in
fact
m
dartagnan
added
he
with
a
smile
turning
towards
the
soldier
who
at
sight
of
the
clerk
had
resumed
his
haughty
attitude
you
do
not
know
this
man
make
his
acquaintance
and
he
pointed
to
colbert
he
has
been
made
but
a
moderately
valuable
servant
in
subaltern
positions
but
he
will
be
a
great
man
if
i
raise
him
to
the
foremost
rank
sire
stammered
colbert
confused
with
pleasure
and
fear
i
always
understood
why
murmured
dartagnan
in
the
kings
ear
he
was
jealous
precisely
and
his
jealousy
confined
his
wings
he
will
henceforward
be
a
wingedserpent
grumbled
the
musketeer
with
a
remnant
of
hatred
against
his
recent
adversary
but
colbert
approaching
him
offered
to
his
eyes
a
physiognomy
so
different
from
that
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
him
wear
he
appeared
so
good
so
mild
so
easy
his
eyes
took
the
expression
of
an
intelligence
so
noble
that
dartagnan
a
connoisseur
in
physiognomies
was
moved
and
almost
changed
in
his
convictions
colbert
pressed
his
hand
that
which
the
king
has
just
told
you
monsieur
proves
how
well
his
majesty
is
acquainted
with
men
the
inveterate
opposition
i
have
displayed
up
to
this
day
against
abuses
and
not
against
men
proves
that
i
had
it
in
view
to
prepare
for
my
king
a
glorious
reign
for
my
country
a
great
blessing
i
have
many
ideas
m
dartagnan
you
will
see
them
expand
in
the
sun
of
public
peace
and
if
i
have
not
the
good
fortune
to
conquer
the
friendship
of
honest
men
i
am
at
least
certain
monsieur
that
i
shall
obtain
their
esteem
for
their
admiration
monsieur
i
would
give
my
life
this
change
this
sudden
elevation
this
mute
approbation
of
the
king
gave
the
musketeer
matter
for
profound
reflection
he
bowed
civilly
to
colbert
who
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
the
king
when
he
saw
they
were
reconciled
dismissed
them
they
left
the
room
together
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
cabinet
the
new
minister
stopping
the
captain
said
is
it
possible
m
dartagnan
that
with
such
an
eye
as
yours
you
did
not
at
the
first
glance
at
the
first
impression
discover
what
sort
of
man
i
am
monsieur
colbert
replied
the
musketeer
a
ray
of
the
sun
in
our
eyes
prevents
us
from
seeing
the
most
vivid
flame
the
man
in
power
radiates
you
know
and
since
you
are
there
why
should
you
continue
to
persecute
him
who
had
just
fallen
into
disgrace
and
fallen
from
such
a
height
i
monsieur
said
colbert
oh
monsieur
i
would
never
persecute
him
i
wished
to
administer
the
finances
and
to
administer
them
alone
because
i
am
ambitious
and
above
all
because
i
have
the
most
entire
confidence
in
my
own
merit
because
i
know
that
all
the
gold
of
this
country
will
ebb
and
flow
beneath
my
eyes
and
i
love
to
look
at
the
kings
gold
because
if
i
live
thirty
years
in
thirty
years
not
a
denir
of
it
will
remain
in
my
hands
because
with
that
gold
i
will
build
granaries
castles
cities
and
harbors
because
i
will
create
a
marine
i
will
equip
navies
that
shall
waft
the
name
of
france
to
the
most
distant
people
because
i
will
create
libraries
and
academies
because
i
will
make
france
the
first
country
in
the
world
and
the
wealthiest
these
are
the
motives
for
my
animosity
against
m
fouquet
who
prevented
my
acting
and
then
when
i
shall
be
great
and
strong
when
france
is
great
and
strong
in
my
turn
then
will
i
cry
mercy
mercy
did
you
say
then
ask
his
liberty
of
the
king
the
king
is
only
crushing
him
on
your
account
colbert
again
raised
his
head
monsieur
said
he
you
know
that
is
not
so
and
that
the
king
has
his
own
personal
animosity
against
m
fouquet
it
is
not
for
me
to
teach
you
that
but
the
king
will
grow
tired
he
will
forget
the
king
never
forgets
m
dartagnan
hark
the
king
calls
he
is
going
to
issue
an
order
i
have
not
influenced
him
have
i
listen
the
king
in
fact
was
calling
his
secretaries
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
i
am
here
sire
give
twenty
of
your
musketeers
to
m
de
saintaignan
to
form
a
guard
for
m
fouquet
dartagnan
and
colbert
exchanged
looks
and
from
angers
continued
the
king
they
will
conduct
the
prisoner
to
the
bastile
in
paris
you
were
right
said
the
captain
to
the
minister
saintaignan
continued
the
king
you
will
have
any
one
shot
who
shall
attempt
to
speak
privately
with
m
fouquet
during
the
journey
but
myself
sire
said
the
duke
you
monsieur
you
will
only
speak
to
him
in
the
presence
of
the
musketeers
the
duke
bowed
and
departed
to
execute
his
commission
dartagnan
was
about
to
retire
likewise
but
the
king
stopped
him
monsieur
said
he
you
will
go
immediately
and
take
possession
of
the
isle
and
fief
of
belleileenmer
yes
sire
alone
you
will
take
a
sufficient
number
of
troops
to
prevent
delay
in
case
the
place
should
be
contumacious
a
murmur
of
courtly
incredulity
rose
from
the
group
of
courtiers
that
shall
be
done
said
dartagnan
i
saw
the
place
in
my
infancy
resumed
the
king
and
i
do
not
wish
to
see
it
again
you
have
heard
me
go
monsieur
and
do
not
return
without
the
keys
colbert
went
up
to
dartagnan
a
commission
which
if
you
carry
it
out
well
said
he
will
be
worth
a
marechals
baton
to
you
why
do
you
employ
the
words
if
you
carry
it
out
well
because
it
is
difficult
ah
in
what
respect
you
have
friends
in
belleisle
monsieur
dartagnan
and
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
for
men
like
you
to
march
over
the
bodies
of
their
friends
to
obtain
success
dartagnan
hung
his
head
in
deepest
thought
whilst
colbert
returned
to
the
king
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
captain
received
the
written
order
from
the
king
to
blow
up
the
fortress
of
belleisle
in
case
of
resistance
with
power
of
life
and
death
over
all
the
inhabitants
or
refugees
and
an
injunction
not
to
allow
one
to
escape
colbert
was
right
thought
dartagnan
for
me
the
baton
of
a
marechal
of
france
will
cost
the
lives
of
my
two
friends
only
they
seem
to
forget
that
my
friends
are
not
more
stupid
than
the
birds
and
that
they
will
not
wait
for
the
hand
of
the
fowler
to
extend
over
their
wings
i
will
show
them
that
hand
so
plainly
that
they
will
have
quite
time
enough
to
see
it
poor
porthos
poor
aramis
no
my
fortune
should
shall
not
cost
your
wings
a
feather
having
thus
determined
dartagnan
assembled
the
royal
army
embarked
it
at
paimboeuf
and
set
sail
without
the
loss
of
an
unnecessary
minute
chapter
xlii
belleileenmer
at
the
extremity
of
the
mole
against
which
the
furious
sea
beats
at
the
evening
tide
two
men
holding
each
other
by
the
arm
were
conversing
in
an
animated
and
expansive
tone
without
the
possibility
of
any
other
human
being
hearing
their
words
borne
away
as
they
were
one
by
one
by
the
gusts
of
wind
with
the
white
foam
swept
from
the
crests
of
the
waves
the
sun
had
just
gone
down
in
the
vast
sheet
of
the
crimsoned
ocean
like
a
gigantic
crucible
from
time
to
time
one
of
these
men
turning
towards
the
east
cast
an
anxious
inquiring
look
over
the
sea
the
other
interrogating
the
features
of
his
companion
seemed
to
seek
for
information
in
his
looks
then
both
silent
busied
with
dismal
thoughts
they
resumed
their
walk
every
one
has
already
perceived
that
these
two
men
were
our
proscribed
heroes
porthos
and
aramis
who
had
taken
refuge
in
belleisle
since
the
ruin
of
their
hopes
since
the
discomfiture
of
the
colossal
schemes
of
m
dherblay
if
is
of
no
use
your
saying
anything
to
the
contrary
my
dear
aramis
repeated
porthos
inhaling
vigorously
the
salt
breeze
with
which
he
charged
his
massive
chest
it
is
of
no
use
aramis
the
disappearance
of
all
the
fishingboats
that
went
out
two
days
ago
is
not
an
ordinary
circumstance
there
has
been
no
storm
at
sea
the
weather
has
been
constantly
calm
not
even
the
lightest
gale
and
even
if
we
had
had
a
tempest
all
our
boats
would
not
have
foundered
i
repeat
it
is
strange
this
complete
disappearance
astonishes
me
i
tell
you
true
murmured
aramis
you
are
right
friend
porthos
it
is
true
there
is
something
strange
in
it
and
further
added
porthos
whose
ideas
the
assent
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
seemed
to
enlarge
and
further
do
you
not
observe
that
if
the
boats
have
perished
not
a
single
plank
has
washed
ashore
i
have
remarked
it
as
well
as
yourself
and
do
you
not
think
it
strange
that
the
two
only
boats
we
had
left
in
the
whole
island
and
which
i
sent
in
search
of
the
others
aramis
here
interrupted
his
companion
by
a
cry
and
by
so
sudden
a
movement
that
porthos
stopped
as
if
he
were
stupefied
what
do
you
say
porthos
whatyou
have
sent
the
two
boats
in
search
of
the
others
yes
to
be
sure
i
have
replied
porthos
calmly
unhappy
man
what
have
you
done
then
we
are
indeed
lost
cried
the
bishop
lostwhat
did
you
say
exclaimed
the
terrified
porthos
how
lost
aramis
how
are
we
lost
aramis
bit
his
lips
nothing
nothing
your
pardon
i
meant
to
say
what
that
if
we
were
inclinedif
we
took
a
fancy
to
make
an
excursion
by
sea
we
could
not
very
good
and
why
should
that
vex
you
a
precious
pleasure
ma
foi
for
my
part
i
dont
regret
it
at
all
what
i
regret
is
certainly
not
the
more
or
less
amusement
we
can
find
at
belleisle
what
i
regret
aramis
is

my
dear

arei
know
not

oh
i
tell
you
in
full
sincerity
of
soul
and
your
affection
will
excuse
my
frankness
but
i
declare
to
you
i
am
not
happy
at

no
in
good
truth
i
am
not
happy
aramis
breathed
a
long
but
stifled
sigh
dear
friend
replied
he
that
is
why
it
is
so
sad
a
thing
you
have
sent
the
two
boats
we
had
left
in
search
of
the
boats
which
disappeared
two
days
ago
if
you
had
not
sent
them
away
we
would
have
departed

parbleu
why
the
orders
you
have
been
constantly
in
and
out
of
season
repeating
to
methat
we
were
to
hold
belleisle
against

you
know
very
well
that
is
true
murmured
aramis
again
you
see
then
plainly
my
friend
that
we
could
not
depart
and
that
the
sending
away
of
the
boats
in
search
of
the
others
cannot
prove
prejudicial
to
us
in
the
very
least
aramis
was
silent
and
his
vague
glances
luminous
as
that
of
an
albatross
hovered
for
a
long
time
over
the
sea
interrogating
space
seeking
to
pierce
the
very
horizon
with
all
that
aramis
continued
porthos
who
adhered
to
his
idea
and
that
the
more
closely
from
the
bishop
having
apparently
endorsed
itwith
all
that
you
give
me
no
explanation
about
what
can
have
happened
to
these
unfortunate
boats
i
am
assailed
by
cries
and
complaints
whichever
way
i
go
the
children
cry
to
see
the
desolation
of
the
women
as
if
i
could
restore
the
absent
husbands
and
fathers
what
do
you
suppose
my
friend
and
how
ought
i
to
answer
them
think
all
you
like
my
good
porthos
and
say
nothing
this
reply
did
not
satisfy
porthos
at
all
he
turned
away
grumbling
something
in
illhumor
aramis
stopped
the
valiant
musketeer
do
you
remember
said
he
in
a
melancholy
tone
kneading
the
two
hands
of
the
giant
between
his
own
with
affectionate
cordiality
do
you
remember
my
friend
that
in
the
glorious
days
of
youthdo
you
remember
porthos
when
we
were
all
strong
and
valiantwe
and
the
other
twoif
we
had
then
had
an
inclination
to
return
to
france
do
you
think
this
sheet
of
salt
water
would
have
stopped
us
oh
said
porthos
but
six
leagues
if
you
had
seen
me
get
astride
of
a
plank
would
you
have
remained
on
land
porthos
no
pardieu
no
aramis
but
nowadays
what
sort
of
a
plank
should
we
want
my
friend
i
in
particular
and
the
seigneur
de
bracieux
cast
a
profound
glance
over
his
colossal
rotundity
with
a
loud
laugh
and
do
you
mean
seriously
to
say
you
are
not
tired
of
belleisle
a
little
and
that
you
would
not
prefer
the
comforts
of
your
dwellingof
your
episcopal
palace
at
vannes
come
confess
no
replied
aramis
without
daring
to
look
at
porthos
let
us
stay
where
we
are
then
said
his
friend
with
a
sigh
which
in
spite
of
the
efforts
he
made
to
restrain
it
escaped
his
echoing
breast
let
us
remainlet
us
remain
and
yet
added
he
and
yet
if
we
seriously
wished
but
that
decidedlyif
we
had
a
fixed
idea
one
firmly
taken
to
return
to
france
and
there
were
not
boats
have
you
remarked
another
thing
my
friendthat
is
since
the
disappearance
of
our
barks
during
the
last
two
days
absence
of
fishermen
not
a
single
small
boat
has
landed
on
the
shores
of
the
isle
yes
certainly
you
are
right
i
too
have
remarked
it
and
the
observation
was
the
more
naturally
made
for
before
the
last
two
fatal
days
barks
and
shallops
were
as
plentiful
as
shrimps
i
must
inquire
said
aramis
suddenly
and
with
great
agitation
and
then
if
we
had
a
raft
constructed
but
there
are
some
canoes
my
friend
shall
i
board
one
a
canoea
canoe
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
porthos
a
canoe
to
be
upset
in
no
no
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
it
is
not
our
trade
to
ride
upon
the
waves
we
will
wait
we
will
wait
and
aramis
continued
walking
about
with
increased
agitation
porthos
who
grew
tired
of
following
all
the
feverish
movements
of
his
friendporthos
who
in
his
faith
and
calmness
understood
nothing
of
the
sort
of
exasperation
which
was
betrayed
by
his
companions
continual
convulsive
startsporthos
stopped
him
let
us
sit
down
upon
this
rock
said
he
place
yourself
there
close
to
me
aramis
and
i
conjure
you
for
the
last
time
to
explain
to
me
in
a
manner
i
can
comprehendexplain
to
me
what
we
are
doing
here
porthos
said
aramis
much
embarrassed
i
know
that
the
false
king
wished
to
dethrone
the
true
king
that
is
a
fact
that
i
understand
well
yes
said
aramis
i
know
that
the
false
king
formed
the
project
of
selling
belleisle
to
the
english
i
understand
that
too
yes
i
know
that
we
engineers
and
captains
came
and
threw
ourselves
into
belleisle
to
take
direction
of
the
works
and
the
command
of
ten
companies
levied
and
paid
by
m
fouquet
or
rather
the
ten
companies
of
his
soninlaw
all
that
is
plain
aramis
rose
in
a
state
of
great
impatience
he
might
be
said
to
be
a
lion
importuned
by
a
gnat
porthos
held
him
by
the
arm
but
what
i
cannot
understand
what
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
my
mind
and
all
my
reflections
i
cannot
comprehend
and
never
shall
comprehend
is
that
instead
of
sending
us
troops
instead
of
sending
us
reinforcements
of
men
munitions
provisions
they
leave
us
without
boats
they
leave
belleisle
without
arrivals
without
help
it
is
that
instead
of
establishing
with
us
a
correspondence
whether
by
signals
or
written
or
verbal
communications
all
relations
with
the
shore
are
intercepted
tell
me
aramis
answer
me
or
rather
before
answering
me
will
you
allow
me
to
tell
you
what
i
have
thought
will
you
hear
what
my
idea
is
the
plan
i
have
conceived
the
bishop
raised
his
head
well
aramis
continued
porthos
i
have
dreamed
i
have
imagined
that
an
event
has
taken
place
in
france
i
dreamt
of
m
fouquet
all
the
night
of
lifeless
fish
of
broken
eggs
of
chambers
badly
furnished
meanly
kept
villainous
dreams
my
dear
dherblay
very
unlucky
such
dreams
porthos
what
is
that
yonder
interrupted
aramis
rising
suddenly
and
pointing
out
to
his
friend
a
black
spot
upon
the
empurpled
line
of
the
water
a
bark
said
porthos
yes
it
is
a
bark
ah
we
shall
have
some
news
at
last
there
are
two
cried
the
bishop
on
discovering
another
mast
two

said
porthos
in
his
turn
six
seven
ah
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
it
is
a
fleet
our
boats
returning
probably
said
aramis
very
uneasily
in
spite
of
the
assurance
he
affected
they
are
very
large
for
fishingboats
observed
porthos
and
do
you
not
remark
my
friend
that
they
come
from
the
loire
they
come
from
the
loireyes
and
look
everybody
here
sees
them
as
well
as
ourselves
look
women
and
children
are
beginning
to
crowd
the
jetty
an
old
fisherman
passed
are
those
our
barks
yonder
asked
aramis
the
old
man
looked
steadily
into
the
eye
of
the
horizon
no
monseigneur
replied
he
they

boars

the
royal

replied
aramis
starting
how
do
you
know
that
said
he
by
the
flag
but
said
porthos
the
boat
is
scarcely
visible
how
the
devil
my
friend
can
you
distinguish
the
flag
i
see
there
is
one
replied
the
old
man
our

not

that
sort
of
craft

generally
used
for
transport
of

ah
groaned
aramis
vivat
cried
porthos
they
are
sending
us
reinforcements
dont
you
think
they
are
aramis
probably
unless
it
is
the
english
coming
by
the
loire
that
would
have
an
evil
look
porthos
for
they
must
have
come
through
paris
you
are
right
they
are
reinforcements
decidedly
or
provisions
aramis
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
made
no
reply
then
all
at
onceporthos
said
he
have
the
alarm
sounded
the
alarm
do
you
imagine
such
a
thing
yes
and
let
the
cannoniers
mount
their
batteries
the
artillerymen
be
at
their
pieces
and
be
particularly
watchful
of
the
coast
batteries
porthos
opened
his
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
he
looked
attentively
at
his
friend
to
convince
himself
he
was
in
his
proper
senses
i
will
do
it
my
dear
porthos
continued
aramis
in
his
blandest
tone
i
will
go
and
have
these
orders
executed
myself
if
you
do
not
go
my
friend
well
i
willinstantly
said
porthos
who
went
to
execute
the
orders
casting
all
the
while
looks
behind
him
to
see
if
the
bishop
of
vannes
were
not
deceived
and
if
on
recovering
more
rational
ideas
he
would
not
recall
him
the
alarm
was
sounded
trumpets
brayed
drums
rolled
the
great
bronze
bell
swung
in
horror
from
its
lofty
belfry
the
dikes
and
moles
were
quickly
filled
with
the
curious
and
soldiers
matches
sparkled
in
the
hands
of
the
artillerymen
placed
behind
the
large
cannon
bedded
in
their
stone
carriages
when
every
man
was
at
his
post
when
all
the
preparations
for
defense
were
made
permit
me
aramis
to
try
to
comprehend
whispered
porthos
timidly
in
aramiss
ear
my
dear
friend
you
will
comprehend
but
too
soon
murmured
m
dherblay
in
reply
to
this
question
of
his
lieutenant
the
fleet
which
is
coming
yonder
with
sails
unfurled
straight
towards
the
port
of
belleisle
is
a
royal
fleet
is
it
not
but
as
there
are
two
kings
in
france
porthos
to
which
of
these
two
kings
does
this
fleet
belong
oh
you
open
my
eyes
replied
the
giant
stunned
by
the
insinuation
and
porthos
whose
eyes
this
reply
of
his
friends
had
at
last
opened
or
rather
thickened
the
bandage
which
covered
his
sight
went
with
his
best
speed
to
the
batteries
to
overlook
his
people
and
exhort
every
one
to
do
his
duty
in
the
meantime
aramis
with
his
eye
fixed
on
the
horizon
saw
the
ships
continually
drawing
nearer
the
people
and
the
soldiers
perched
on
the
summits
of
the
rocks
could
distinguish
the
masts
then
the
lower
sails
and
at
last
the
hulls
of
the
lighters
bearing
at
the
masthead
the
royal
flag
of
france
it
was
night
when
one
of
these
vessels
which
had
created
such
a
sensation
among
the
inhabitants
of
belleisle
dropped
anchor
within
cannon
shot
of
the
place
it
was
soon
seen
notwithstanding
the
darkness
that
some
sort
of
agitation
reigned
on
board
the
vessel
from
the
side
of
which
a
skiff
was
lowered
of
which
the
three
rowers
bending
to
their
oars
took
the
direction
of
the
port
and
in
a
few
instants
struck
land
at
the
foot
of
the
fort
the
commander
jumped
ashore
he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
which
he
waved
in
the
air
and
seemed
to
wish
to
communicate
with
somebody
this
man
was
soon
recognized
by
several
soldiers
as
one
of
the
pilots
of
the
island
he
was
the
captain
of
one
of
the
two
barks
retained
by
aramis
but
which
porthos
in
his
anxiety
with
regard
to
the
fate
of
the
fishermen
who
had
disappeared
had
sent
in
search
of
the
missing
boats
he
asked
to
be
conducted
to
m
dherblay
two
soldiers
at
a
signal
from
a
sergeant
marched
him
between
them
and
escorted
him
aramis
was
upon
the
quay
the
envoy
presented
himself
before
the
bishop
of
vannes
the
darkness
was
almost
absolute
notwithstanding
the
flambeaux
borne
at
a
small
distance
by
the
soldiers
who
were
following
aramis
in
his
rounds
well
jonathan
from
whom
do
you
come
monseigneur
from
those
who
captured
me
who
captured
you
you
know
monseigneur
we
set
out
in
search
of
our
comrades
yes
and
afterwards
well
monseigneur
within
a
short
league
we
were
captured
by
a
chasse
maree
belonging
to
the
king
ah
said
aramis
of
which
king
cried
porthos
jonathan
started
speak
continued
the
bishop
we
were
captured
monseigneur
and
joined
to
those
who
had
been
taken
yesterday
morning
what
was
the
cause
of
the
mania
for
capturing
you
all
said
porthos
monsieur
to
prevent
us
from
telling
you
replied
jonathan
porthos
was
again
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
and
they
have
released
you
today
asked
he
that
i
might
tell
you
they
have
captured
us
monsieur
trouble
upon
trouble
thought
honest
porthos
during
this
time
aramis
was
reflecting
humph
said
he
then
i
suppose
it
is
a
royal
fleet
blockading
the
coasts
yes
monseigneur
who
commands
it
the
captain
of
the
kings
musketeers
dartagnan
dartagnan
exclaimed
porthos
i
believe
that
is
the
name
and
did
he
give
you
this
letter
yes
monseigneur
bring
the
torches
nearer
it
is
his
writing
said
porthos

eagerly
read
the
following
lines
order
of
the
king
to
take
belleisle
or
to
put
the
garrison
to

if
they
resist

to
make
prisoners
of
all
the
men
of
the

signed
dartagnan
who
the
day
before
yesterday
arrested
m
fouquet
for
the
purpose
of
his
being
sent
to
the
bastile
aramis
turned
pale
and
crushed
the
paper
in
his
hands
what
is
it
asked
porthos
nothing
my
friend
nothing
tell
me
jonathan
monseigneur
did
you
speak
to
m
dartagnan
yes
monseigneur
what
did
he
say
to
you
that
for
ampler
information
he
would
speak
with
monseigneur
where
on
board
his
own
vessel
on

his
vessel
and
porthos
repeated
on
board
his
vessel
m
le
mousquetaire
continued
jonathan
told
me
to
take
you
both
on
board
my
canoe
and
bring
you
to
him
let
us
go
at
once
exclaimed
porthos
dear
dartagnan
but
aramis
stopped
him
are
you
mad
cried
he
who
knows
that
it
is
not
a
snare
of
the
other
kings
said
porthos
mysteriously
a
snare
in
fact
thats
what
it
is
my
friend
very
possibly
what
is
to
be
done
then
if
dartagnan
sends
for
us
who
assures
you
that
dartagnan
sends
for
us
well
butbut
his
writing
writing
is
easily
counterfeited
this
looks
counterfeitedunsteady
you
are
always
right
but
in
the
meantime
we
know
nothing
aramis
was
silent
it
is
true
said
the
good
porthos
we
do
not
want
to
know
anything
what
shall
i
do
asked
jonathan
you
will
return
on
board
this
captains
vessel
yes
monseigneur
and
will
tell
him
that
we
beg
he
will
himself
come
into
the
island
ah
i
comprehend
said
porthos
yes
monseigneur
replied
jonathan
but
if
the
captain
should
refuse
to
come
to
belleisle
if
he
refuses
as
we
have
cannon
we
will
make
use
of
them
what
against
dartagnan
if
it
is
dartagnan
porthos
he
will
come
go
jonathan
go
ma
foi
i
no
longer
comprehend
anything
murmured
porthos
i
will
make
you
comprehend
it
all
my
dear
friend
the
time
for
it
has
come
sit
down
upon
this
guncarriage
open
your
ears
and
listen
well
to
me
oh
pardieu
i
will
listen
no
fear
of
that
may
i
depart
monseigneur
cried
jonathan
yes
begone
and
bring
back
an
answer
allow
the
canoe
to
pass
you
men
there
and
the
canoe
pushed
off
to
regain
the
fleet
aramis
took
porthos
by
the
hand
and
commenced
his
explanations
chapter
xliii
explanations
by
aramis
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
friend
porthos
will
probably
surprise
you
but
it
may
prove
instructive
i
like
to
be
surprised
said
porthos
in
a
kindly
tone
do
not
spare
me
therefore
i
beg
i
am
hardened
against
emotions
dont
fear
speak
out
it
is
difficult
porthosdifficult
for
in
truth
i
warn
you
a
second
time
i
have
very
strange
things
very
extraordinary
things
to
tell
you
oh
you
speak
so
well
my
friend
that
i
could
listen
to
you
for
days
together
speak
then
i
begandstop
i
have
an
idea
i
will
to
make
your
task
more
easy
i
will
to
assist
you
in
telling
me
such
things
question
you
i
shall
be
pleased
at
your
doing
so
what
are
we
going
to
fight
for
aramis
if
you
ask
me
many
such
questions
as
thatif
you
would
render
my
task
the
easier
by
interrupting
my
revelations
thus
porthos
you
will
not
help
me
at
all
so
far
on
the
contrary
that
is
the
very
gordian
knot
but
my
friend
with
a
man
like
you
good
generous
and
devoted
the
confession
must
be
bravely
made
i
have
deceived
you
my
worthy
friend
you
have
deceived
me
good
heavens
yes
was
it
for
my
good
aramis
i
thought
so
porthos
i
thought
so
sincerely
my
friend
then
said
the
honest
seigneur
of
bracieux
you
have
rendered
me
a
service
and
i
thank
you
for
it
for
if
you
had
not
deceived
me
i
might
have
deceived
myself
in
what
then
have
you
deceived
me
tell
me
in
that
i
was
serving
the
usurper
against
whom
louis
xiv
at
this
moment
is
directing
his
efforts
the
usurper
said
porthos
scratching
his
head
that
iswell
i
do
not
quite
clearly
comprehend
he
is
one
of
the
two
kings
who
are
contending
for
the
crown
of
france
very
well
then
you
were
serving
him
who
is
not
louis
xiv
you
have
hit
the
matter
in
one
word
it
follows
that
it
follows
that
we
are
rebels
my
poor
friend
the
devil
the
devil
cried
porthos
much
disappointed
oh
but
dear
porthos
be
calm
we
shall
still
find
means
of
getting
out
of
the
affair
trust
me
it
is
not
that
which
makes
me
uneasy
replied
porthos
that
which
alone
touches
me
is
that
ugly
word
rebels
ah
but
and
so
according
to
this
the
duchy
that
was
promised
me
it
was
the
usurper
that
was
to
give
it
to
you
and
that
is
not
the
same
thing
aramis
said
porthos
majestically
my
friend
if
it
had
only
depended
upon
me
you
should
have
become
a
prince
porthos
began
to
bite
his
nails
in
a
melancholy
way
that
is
where
you
have
been
wrong
continued
he
in
deceiving
me
for
that
promised
duchy
i
reckoned
upon
oh
i
reckoned
upon
it
seriously
knowing
you
to
be
a
man
of
your
word
aramis
poor
porthos
pardon
me
i
implore
you
so
then
continued
porthos
without
replying
to
the
bishops
prayer
so
then
it
seems
i
have
quite
fallen
out
with
louis
xiv
oh
i
will
settle
all
that
my
good
friend
i
will
settle
all
that
i
will
take
it
on
myself
alone
aramis
no
no
porthos
i
conjure
you
let
me
act
no
false
generosity
no
inopportune
devotedness
you
knew
nothing
of
my
projects
you
have
done
nothing
of
yourself
with
me
it
is
different
i
alone
am
the
author
of
this
plot
i
stood
in
need
of
my
inseparable
companion
i
called
upon
you
and
you
came
to
me
in
remembrance
of
our
ancient
device
all
for
one
one
for
all
my
crime
is
that
i
was
an
egotist
now
that
is
a
word
i
like
said
porthos
and
seeing
that
you
have
acted
entirely
for
yourself
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
blame
you
it
is
natural
and
upon
this
sublime
reflection
porthos
pressed
his
friends
hand
cordially
in
presence
of
this
ingenuous
greatness
of
soul
aramis
felt
his
own
littleness
it
was
the
second
time
he
had
been
compelled
to
bend
before
real
superiority
of
heart
which
is
more
imposing
than
brilliancy
of
mind
he
replied
by
a
mute
and
energetic
pressure
to
the
endearment
of
his
friend
now
said
porthos
that
we
have
come
to
an
explanation
now
that
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
our
situation
with
respect
to
louis
xiv
i
think
my
friend
it
is
time
to
make
me
comprehend
the
political
intrigue
of
which
we
are
the
victimsfor
i
plainly
see
there
is
a
political
intrigue
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
dartagnan
my
good
porthos
dartagnan
is
coming
and
will
detail
it
to
you
in
all
its
circumstances
but
excuse
me
i
am
deeply
grieved
i
am
bowed
down
with
mental
anguish
and
i
have
need
of
all
my
presence
of
mind
all
my
powers
of
reflection
to
extricate
you
from
the
false
position
in
which
i
have
so
imprudently
involved
you
but
nothing
can
be
more
clear
nothing
more
plain
than
your
position
henceforth
the
king
louis
xiv
has
no
longer
now
but
one
enemy
that
enemy
is
myself
myself
alone
i
have
made
you
a
prisoner
you
have
followed
me
today
i
liberate
you
you
fly
back
to
your
prince
you
can
perceive
porthos
there
is
not
one
difficulty
in
all
this
do
you
think
so
said
porthos
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
then
why
said
the
admirable
good
sense
of
porthos
then
why
if
we
are
in
such
an
easy
position
why
my
friend
do
we
prepare
cannon
muskets
and
engines
of
all
sorts
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
much
more
simple
to
say
to
captain
dartagnan
my
dear
friend
we
have
been
mistaken
that
error
is
to
be
repaired
open
the
door
to
us
let
us
pass
through
and
we
will
say
goodbye
ah
that
said
aramis
shaking
his
head
why
do
you
say
that
do
you
not
approve
of
my
plan
my
friend
i
see
a
difficulty
in
it
what
is
it
the
hypothesis
that
dartagnan
may
come
with
orders
which
will
oblige
us
to
defend
ourselves
what
defend
ourselves
against
dartagnan
folly
against
the
good
dartagnan
aramis
once
more
replied
by
shaking
his
head
porthos
at
length
said
he
if
i
have
had
the
matches
lighted
and
the
guns
pointed
if
i
have
had
the
signal
of
alarm
sounded
if
i
have
called
every
man
to
his
post
upon
the
ramparts
those
good
ramparts
of
belleisle
which
you
have
so
well
fortified
it
was
not
for
nothing
wait
to
judge
or
rather
no
do
not
wait
what
can
i
do
if
i
knew
my
friend
i
would
have
told
you
but
there
is
one
thing
much
more
simple
than
defending
ourselvesa
boat
and
away
for
francewhere
my
dear
friend
said
aramis
smiling
with
a
strong
shade
of
sadness
do
not
let
us
reason
like
children
let
us
be
men
in
council
and
in
executionbut
hark
i
hear
a
hail
for
landing
at
the
port
attention
porthos
serious
attention
it
is
dartagnan
no
doubt
said
porthos
in
a
voice
of
thunder
approaching
the
parapet
yes
it
is
i
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
running
lightly
up
the
steps
of
the
mole
and
gaining
rapidly
the
little
esplanade
on
which
his
two
friends
waited
for
him
as
soon
as
he
came
towards
them
porthos
and
aramis
observed
an
officer
who
followed
dartagnan
treading
apparently
in
his
very
steps
the
captain
stopped
upon
the
stairs
of
the
mole
when
halfway
up
his
companions
imitated
him
make
your
men
draw
back
cried
dartagnan
to
porthos
and
aramis
let
them
retire
out
of
hearing
this
order
given
by
porthos
was
executed
immediately
then
dartagnan
turning
towards
him
who
followed
him
monsieur
said
he
we
are
no
longer
on
board
the
kings
fleet
where
in
virtue
of
your
order
you
spoke
so
arrogantly
to
me
just
now
monsieur
replied
the
officer
i
did
not
speak
arrogantly
to
you
i
simply
but
rigorously
obeyed
instructions
i
was
commanded
to
follow
you
i
follow
you
i
am
directed
not
to
allow
you
to
communicate
with
any
one
without
taking
cognizance
of
what
you
do
i
am
in
duty
bound
accordingly
to
overhear
your
conversations
dartagnan
trembled
with
rage
and
porthos
and
aramis
who
heard
this
dialogue
trembled
likewise
but
with
uneasiness
and
fear
dartagnan
biting
his
mustache
with
that
vivacity
which
denoted
in
him
exasperation
closely
to
be
followed
by
an
explosion
approached
the
officer
monsieur
said
he
in
a
low
voice
so
much
the
more
impressive
that
affecting
calm
it
threatened
tempestmonsieur
when
i
sent
a
canoe
hither
you
wished
to
know
what
i
wrote
to
the
defenders
of
belleisle
you
produced
an
order
to
that
effect
and
in
my
turn
i
instantly
showed
you
the
note
i
had
written
when
the
skipper
of
the
boat
sent
by
me
returned
when
i
received
the
reply
of
these
two
gentlemen
and
he
pointed
to
aramis
and
porthos
you
heard
every
word
of
what
the
messenger
said
all
that
was
plainly
in
your
orders
all
that
was
well
executed
very
punctually
was
it
not
yes
monsieur
stammered
the
officer
yes
without
doubt
but
monsieur
continued
dartagnan
growing
warmmonsieur
when
i
manifested
the
intention
of
quitting
my
vessel
to
cross
to
belleisle
you
demanded
to
accompany
me
i
did
not
hesitate
i
brought
you
with
me
you
are
now
at
belleisle
are
you
not
yes
monsieur
but
butthe
question
no
longer
is
of
m
colbert
who
has
given
you
that
order
or
of
whomsoever
in
the
world
you
are
following
the
instructions
the
question
now
is
of
a
man
who
is
a
clog
upon
m
dartagnan
and
who
is
alone
with
m
dartagnan
upon
steps
whose
feet
are
bathed
by
thirty
feet
of
salt
water
a
bad
position
for
that
man
a
bad
position
monsieur
i
warn
you
but
monsieur
if
i
am
a
restraint
upon
you
said
the
officer
timidly
and
almost
faintly
it
is
my
duty
which
monsieur
you
have
had
the
misfortune
either
you
or
those
that
sent
you
to
insult
me
it
is
done
i
cannot
seek
redress
from
those
who
employ
youthey
are
unknown
to
me
or
are
at
too
great
a
distance
but
you
are
under
my
hand
and
i
swear
that
if
you
make
one
step
behind
me
when
i
raise
my
feet
to
go
up
to
those
gentlemen
i
swear
to
you
by
my
name
i
will
cleave
your
head
in
two
with
my
sword
and
pitch
you
into
the
water
oh
it
will
happen
it
will
happen
i
have
only
been
six
times
angry
in
my
life
monsieur
and
all
five
preceding
times
i
killed
my
man
the
officer
did
not
stir
he
became
pale
under
this
terrible
threat
but
replied
with
simplicity
monsieur
you
are
wrong
in
acting
against
my
orders
porthos
and
aramis
mute
and
trembling
at
the
top
of
the
parapet
cried
to
the
musketeer
good
dartagnan
take
care
dartagnan
made
them
a
sign
to
keep
silence
raised
his
foot
with
ominous
calmness
to
mount
the
stair
and
turned
round
sword
in
hand
to
see
if
the
officer
followed
him
the
officer
made
a
sign
of
the
cross
and
stepped
up
porthos
and
aramis
who
knew
their
dartagnan
uttered
a
cry
and
rushed
down
to
prevent
the
blow
they
thought
they
already
heard
but
dartagnan
passed
his
sword
into
his
left
hand
monsieur
said
he
to
the
officer
in
an
agitated
voice
you
are
a
brave
man
you
will
all
the
better
comprehend
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
now
speak
monsieur
dartagnan
speak
replied
the
officer
these
gentlemen
we
have
just
seen
and
against
whom
you
have
orders
are
my
friends
i
know
they
are
monsieur
you
can
understand
whether
or
not
i
ought
to
act
towards
them
as
your
instructions
prescribe
i
understand
your
reserve
very
well
permit
me
then
to
converse
with
them
without
a
witness
monsieur
dartagnan
if
i
yield
to
your
request
if
i
do
that
which
you
beg
me
i
break
my
word
but
if
i
do
not
do
it
i
disoblige
you
i
prefer
the
one
dilemma
to
the
other
converse
with
your
friends
and
do
not
despise
me
monsieur
for
doing
this
for
your
sake
whom
i
esteem
and
honor
do
not
despise
me
for
committing
for
you
and
you
alone
an
unworthy
act
dartagnan
much
agitated
threw
his
arm
round
the
neck
of
the
young
man
and
then
went
up
to
his
friends
the
officer
enveloped
in
his
cloak
sat
down
on
the
damp
weedcovered
steps
well
said
dartagnan
to
his
friends
such
is
my
position
judge
for
yourselves
all
three
embraced
as
in
the
glorious
days
of
their
youth
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
these
preparations
said
porthos
you
ought
to
have
a
suspicion
of
what
they
signify
said
dartagnan
not
any
i
assure
you
my
dear
captain
for
in
fact
i
have
done
nothing
no
more
has
aramis
the
worthy
baron
hastened
to
say
dartagnan
darted
a
reproachful
look
at
the
prelate
which
penetrated
that
hardened
heart
dear
porthos
cried
the
bishop
of
vannes
you
see
what
is
being
done
against
you
said
dartagnan
interception
of
all
boats
coming
to
or
going
from
belleisle
your
means
of
transport
seized
if
you
had
endeavored
to
fly
you
would
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
cruisers
that
plow
the
sea
in
all
directions
on
the
watch
for
you
the
king
wants
you
to
be
taken
and
he
will
take
you
dartagnan
tore
at
his
gray
mustache
aramis
grew
somber
porthos
angry
my
idea
was
this
continued
dartagnan
to
make
you
both
come
on
board
to
keep
you
near
me
and
restore
you
your
liberty
but
now
who
can
say
when
i
return
to
my
ship
i
may
not
find
a
superior
that
i
may
not
find
secret
orders
which
will
take
from
me
my
command
and
give
it
to
another
who
will
dispose
of
me
and
you
without
hope
of
help
we
must
remain
at
belleisle
said
aramis
resolutely
and
i
assure
you
for
my
part
i
will
not
surrender
easily
porthos
said
nothing
dartagnan
remarked
the
silence
of
his
friend
i
have
another
trial
to
make
of
this
officer
of
this
brave
fellow
who
accompanies
me
and
whose
courageous
resistance
makes
me
very
happy
for
it
denotes
an
honest
man
who
though
an
enemy
is
a
thousand
times
better
than
a
complaisant
coward
let
us
try
to
learn
from
him
what
his
instructions
are
and
what
his
orders
permit
or
forbid
let
us
try
said
aramis
dartagnan
went
to
the
parapet
leaned
over
towards
the
steps
of
the
mole
and
called
the
officer
who
immediately
came
up
monsieur
said
dartagnan
after
having
exchanged
the
cordial
courtesies
natural
between
gentlemen
who
know
and
appreciate
each
other
monsieur
if
i
wished
to
take
away
these
gentlemen
from
here
what
would
you
do
i
should
not
oppose
it
monsieur
but
having
direct
explicit
orders
to
put
them
under
guard
i
should
detain
them
ah
said
dartagnan
thats
all
over
said
aramis
gloomily
porthos
did
not
stir
but
still
take
porthos
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
he
can
prove
to
the
king
and
i
will
help
him
do
so
and
you
too
monsieur
dartagnan
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
hum
said
dartagnan
will
you
come
will
you
follow
me
porthos
the
king
is
merciful
i
want
time
for
reflection
said
porthos
you
will
remain
here
then
until
fresh
orders
said
aramis
with
vivacity
until
we
have
an
idea
resumed
dartagnan
and
i
now
believe
that
will
not
be
long
for
i
have
one
already
let
us
say
adieu
then
said
aramis
but
in
truth
my
good
porthos
you
ought
to
go
no
said
the
latter
laconically
as
you
please
replied
aramis
a
little
wounded
in
his
susceptibilities
at
the
morose
tone
of
his
companion
only
i
am
reassured
by
the
promise
of
an
idea
from
dartagnan
an
idea
i
fancy
i
have
divined
let
us
see
said
the
musketeer
placing
his
ear
near
aramiss
mouth
the
latter
spoke
several
words
rapidly
to
which
dartagnan
replied
that
is
it
precisely
infallible
cried
aramis
during
the
first
emotion
this
resolution
will
cause
take
care
of
yourself
aramis
oh
dont
be
afraid
now
monsieur
said
dartagnan
to
the
officer
thanks
a
thousand
thanks
you
have
made
yourself
three
friends
for
life
yes
added
aramis
porthos
alone
said
nothing
but
merely
bowed
dartagnan
having
tenderly
embraced
his
two
old
friends
left
belleisle
with
the
inseparable
companion
with
whom
m
colbert
had
saddled
him
thus
with
the
exception
of
the
explanation
with
which
the
worthy
porthos
had
been
willing
to
be
satisfied
nothing
had
changed
in
appearance
in
the
fate
of
one
or
the
other
only
said
aramis
there
is
dartagnans
idea
dartagnan
did
not
return
on
board
without
profoundly
analyzing
the
idea
he
had
discovered
now
we
know
that
whatever
dartagnan
did
examine
according
to
custom
daylight
was
certain
to
illuminate
as
to
the
officer
now
grown
mute
again
he
had
full
time
for
meditation
therefore
on
putting
his
foot
on
board
his
vessel
moored
within
cannonshot
of
the
island
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
had
already
got
together
all
his
means
offensive
and
defensive
he
immediately
assembled
his
council
which
consisted
of
the
officers
serving
under
his
orders
these
were
eight
in
number
a
chief
of
the
maritime
forces
a
major
directing
the
artillery
an
engineer
the
officer
we
are
acquainted
with
and
four
lieutenants
having
assembled
them
dartagnan
arose
took
of
his
hat
and
addressed
them
thus
gentlemen
i
have
been
to
reconnoiter
belleileenmer
and
i
have
found
in
it
a
good
and
solid
garrison
moreover
preparations
are
made
for
a
defense
that
may
prove
troublesome
i
therefore
intend
to
send
for
two
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
place
that
we
may
converse
with
them
having
separated
them
from
their
troops
and
cannon
we
shall
be
better
able
to
deal
with
them
particularly
by
reasoning
with
them
is
not
this
your
opinion
gentlemen
the
major
of
artillery
rose
monsieur
said
he
with
respect
but
firmness
i
have
heard
you
say
that
the
place
is
preparing
to
make
a
troublesome
defense
the
place
is
then
as
you
know
determined
on
rebellion
dartagnan
was
visibly
put
out
by
this
reply
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
allow
himself
to
be
subdued
by
a
trifle
and
resumed
monsieur
said
he
your
reply
is
just
but
you
are
ignorant
that
belleisle
is
a
fief
of
m
fouquets
and
that
former
monarchs
gave
the
right
to
the
seigneurs
of
belleisle
to
arm
their
people
the
major
made
a
movement
oh
do
not
interrupt
me
continued
dartagnan
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
that
right
to
arm
themselves
against
the
english
was
not
a
right
to
arm
themselves
against
their
king
but
it
is
not
m
fouquet
i
suppose
who
holds
belleisle
at
this
moment
since
i
arrested
m
fouquet
the
day
before
yesterday
now
the
inhabitants
and
defenders
of
belleisle
know
nothing
of
this
arrest
you
would
announce
it
to
them
in
vain
it
is
a
thing
so
unheardof
and
extraordinary
so
unexpected
that
they
would
not
believe
you
a
breton
serves
his
master
and
not
his
masters
he
serves
his
master
till
he
has
seen
him
dead
now
the
bretons
as
far
as
i
know
have
not
seen
the
body
of
m
fouquet
it
is
not
then
surprising
they
hold
out
against
that
which
is
neither
m
fouquet
nor
his
signature
the
major
bowed
in
token
of
assent
that
is
why
continued
dartagnan
i
propose
to
cause
two
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
garrison
to
come
on
board
my
vessel
they
will
see
you
gentlemen
they
will
see
the
forces
we
have
at
our
disposal
they
will
consequently
know
to
what
they
have
to
trust
and
the
fate
that
attends
them
in
case
of
rebellion
we
will
affirm
to
them
upon
our
honor
that
m
fouquet
is
a
prisoner
and
that
all
resistance
can
only
be
prejudicial
to
them
we
will
tell
them
that
at
the
first
cannon
fired
there
will
be
no
further
hope
of
mercy
from
the
king
then
or
so
at
least
i
trust
they
will
resist
no
longer
they
will
yield
up
without
fighting
and
we
shall
have
a
place
given
up
to
us
in
a
friendly
way
which
it
might
cost
prodigious
efforts
to
subdue
the
officer
who
had
followed
dartagnan
to
belleisle
was
preparing
to
speak
but
dartagnan
interrupted
him
yes
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
tell
me
monsieur
i
know
that
there
is
an
order
of
the
kings
to
prevent
all
secret
communications
with
the
defenders
of
belleisle
and
that
is
exactly
why
i
do
not
offer
to
communicate
except
in
presence
of
my
staff
and
dartagnan
made
an
inclination
of
the
head
to
his
officers
who
knew
him
well
enough
to
attach
a
certain
value
to
the
condescension
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
as
if
to
read
each
others
opinions
in
their
eyes
with
the
intention
of
evidently
acting
should
they
agree
according
to
the
desire
of
dartagnan
and
already
the
latter
saw
with
joy
that
the
result
of
their
consent
would
be
sending
a
bark
to
porthos
and
aramis
when
the
kings
officer
drew
from
a
pocket
a
folded
paper
which
he
placed
in
the
hands
of
dartagnan
this
paper
bore
upon
its
superscription
the
number
1
what
more
murmured
the
surprised
captain
read
monsieur
said
the
officer
with
a
courtesy
that
was
not
free
from
sadness
dartagnan
full
of
mistrust
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
these
words
prohibition
to
m
dartagnan
to
assemble
any
council
whatever
or
to
deliberate
in
any
way
before
belleisle
be
surrendered
and
the
prisoners
shot
signedlouis
dartagnan
repressed
the
quiver
of
impatience
that
ran
through
his
whole
body
and
with
a
gracious
smile
that
is
well
monsieur
said
he
the
kings
orders
shall
be
complied
with
chapter
xliv
result
of
the
ideas
of
the
king
and
the
ideas
of
dartagnan
the
blow
was
direct
it
was
severe
mortal
dartagnan
furious
at
having
been
anticipated
by
an
idea
of
the
kings
did
not
despair
however
even
yet
and
reflecting
upon
the
idea
he
had
brought
back
from
belleisle
he
elicited
therefrom
novel
means
of
safety
for
his
friends
gentlemen
said
he
suddenly
since
the
king
has
charged
some
other
than
myself
with
his
secret
orders
it
must
be
because
i
no
longer
possess
his
confidence
and
i
should
really
be
unworthy
of
it
if
i
had
the
courage
to
hold
a
command
subject
to
so
many
injurious
suspicions
therefore
i
will
go
immediately
and
carry
my
resignation
to
the
king
i
tender
it
before
you
all
enjoining
you
all
to
fall
back
with
me
upon
the
coast
of
france
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
compromise
the
safety
of
the
forces
his
majesty
has
confided
to
me
for
this
purpose
return
all
to
your
posts
within
an
hour
we
shall
have
the
ebb
of
the
tide
to
your
posts
gentlemen
i
suppose
added
he
on
seeing
that
all
prepared
to
obey
him
except
the
surveillant
officer
you
have
no
orders
to
object
this
time
and
dartagnan
almost
triumphed
while
speaking
these
words
this
plan
would
prove
the
safety
of
his
friends
the
blockade
once
raised
they
might
embark
immediately
and
set
sail
for
england
or
spain
without
fear
of
being
molested
whilst
they
were
making
their
escape
dartagnan
would
return
to
the
king
would
justify
his
return
by
the
indignation
which
the
mistrust
of
colbert
had
raised
in
him
he
would
be
sent
back
with
full
powers
and
he
would
take
belleisle
that
is
to
say
the
cage
after
the
birds
had
flown
but
to
this
plan
the
officer
opposed
a
further
order
of
the
kings
it
was
thus
conceived
from
the
moment
m
dartagnan
shall
have
manifested
the
desire
of
giving
in
his
resignation
he
shall
no
longer
be
reckoned
leader
of
the
expedition
and
every
officer
placed
under
his
orders
shall
be
held
to
no
longer
obey
him
moreover
the
said
monsieur
dartagnan
having
lost
that
quality
of
leader
of
the
army
sent
against
belleisle
shall
set
out
immediately
for
france
accompanied
by
the
officer
who
will
have
remitted
the
message
to
him
and
who
will
consider
him
a
prisoner
for
whom
he
is
answerable
brave
and
careless
as
he
was
dartagnan
turned
pale
everything
had
been
calculated
with
a
depth
of
precognition
which
for
the
first
time
in
thirty
years
recalled
to
him
the
solid
foresight
and
inflexible
logic
of
the
great
cardinal
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
thoughtful
scarcely
breathing
if
i
were
to
put
this
order
in
my
pocket
thought
he
who
would
know
it
what
would
prevent
my
doing
it
before
the
king
had
had
time
to
be
informed
i
should
have
saved
those
poor
fellows
yonder
let
us
exercise
some
small
audacity
my
head
is
not
one
of
those
the
executioner
strikes
off
for
disobedience
we
will
disobey
but
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
adopt
this
plan
he
saw
the
officers
around
him
reading
similar
orders
which
the
passive
agent
of
the
thoughts
of
that
infernal
colbert
had
distributed
to
them
this
contingency
of
his
disobedience
had
been
foreseenas
all
the
rest
had
been
monsieur
said
the
officer
coming
up
to
him
i
await
your
good
pleasure
to
depart
i
am
ready
monsieur
replied
dartagnan
grinding
his
teeth
the
officer
immediately
ordered
a
canoe
to
receive
m
dartagnan
and
himself
at
sight
of
this
he
became
almost
distraught
with
rage
how
stammered
he
will
you
carry
on
the
directions
of
the
different
corps
when
you
are
gone
monsieur
replied
the
commander
of
the
fleet
it
is
to
me
the
command
of
the
whole
is
committed
then
monsieur
rejoined
colberts
man
addressing
the
new
leader
it
is
for
you
that
this
last
order
remitted
to
me
is
intended
let
us
see
your
powers
here
they
are
said
the
officer
exhibiting
the
royal
signature
here
are
your
instructions
replied
the
officer
placing
the
folded
paper
in
his
hands
and
turning
round
towards
dartagnan
come
monsieur
said
he
in
an
agitated
voice
such
despair
did
he
behold
in
that
man
of
iron
do
me
the
favor
to
depart
at
once
immediately
articulated
dartagnan
feebly
subdued
crushed
by
implacable
impossibility
and
he
painfully
subsided
into
the
little
boat
which
started
favored
by
wind
and
tide
for
the
coast
of
france
the
kings
guards
embarked
with
him
the
musketeer
still
preserved
the
hope
of
reaching
nantes
quickly
and
of
pleading
the
cause
of
his
friends
eloquently
enough
to
incline
the
king
to
mercy
the
bark
flew
like
a
swallow
dartagnan
distinctly
saw
the
land
of
france
profiled
in
black
against
the
white
clouds
of
night
ah
monsieur
said
he
in
a
low
voice
to
the
officer
to
whom
for
an
hour
he
had
ceased
speaking
what
would
i
give
to
know
the
instructions
for
the
new
commander
they
are
all
pacific
are
they
not
and
he
did
not
finish
the
thunder
of
a
distant
cannon
rolled
athwart
the
waves
another
and
two
or
three
still
louder
dartagnan
shuddered
they
have
commenced
the
siege
of
belleisle
replied
the
officer
the
canoe
had
just
touched
the
soil
of
france
chapter
xlv
the
ancestors
of
porthos
when
dartagnan
left
aramis
and
porthos
the
latter
returned
to
the
principal
fort
in
order
to
converse
with
greater
liberty
porthos
still
thoughtful
was
a
restraint
on
aramis
whose
mind
had
never
felt
itself
more
free
dear
porthos
said
he
suddenly
i
will
explain
dartagnans
idea
to
you
what
idea
aramis
an
idea
to
which
we
shall
owe
our
liberty
within
twelve
hours
ah
indeed
said
porthos
much
astonished
let
us
hear
it
did
you
remark
in
the
scene
our
friend
had
with
the
officer
that
certain
orders
constrained
him
with
regard
to
us
yes
i
did
notice
that
well
dartagnan
is
going
to
give
in
his
resignation
to
the
king
and
during
the
confusion
that
will
result
from
his
absence
we
will
get
away
or
rather
you
will
get
away
porthos
if
there
is
possibility
of
flight
for
only
one
here
porthos
shook
his
head
and
replied
we
will
escape
together
aramis
or
we
will
stay
together
thine
is
a
right
a
generous
heart
said
aramis
only
your
melancholy
uneasiness
affects
me
i
am
not
uneasy
said
porthos
then
you
are
angry
with
me
i
am
not
angry
with
you
then
why
my
friend
do
you
put
on
such
a
dismal
countenance
i
will
tell
you
i
am
making
my
will
and
while
saying
these
words
the
good
porthos
looked
sadly
in
the
face
of
aramis
your
will
cried
the
bishop
what
then
do
you
think
yourself
lost
i
feel
fatigued
it
is
the
first
time
and
there
is
a
custom
in
our
family
what
is
it
my
friend
my
grandfather
was
a
man
twice
as
strong
as
i
am
indeed
said
aramis
then
your
grandfather
must
have
been
samson
himself
no
his
name
was
antoine
well
he
was
about
my
age
when
setting
out
one
day
for
the
chase
he
felt
his
legs
weak
the
man
who
had
never
known
what
weakness
was
before
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
fatigue
my
friend
nothing
good
as
you
will
see
for
having
set
out
complaining
still
of
weakness
of
the
legs
he
met
a
wild
boar
which
made
head
against
him
he
missed
him
with
his
arquebuse
and
was
ripped
up
by
the
beast
and
died
immediately
there
is
no
reason
in
that
why
you
should
alarm
yourself
dear
porthos
oh
you
will
see
my
father
was
as
strong
again
as
i
am
he
was
a
rough
soldier
under
henry
iii
and
henry
iv
his
name
was
not
antoine
but
gaspard
the
same
as
m
de
coligny
always
on
horseback
he
had
never
known
what
lassitude
was
one
evening
as
he
rose
from
table
his
legs
failed
him
he
had
supped
heartily
perhaps
said
aramis
and
that
was
why
he
staggered
bah
a
friend
of
m
de
bassompierre
nonsense
no
no
he
was
astonished
at
this
lassitude
and
said
to
my
mother
who
laughed
at
him
would
not
one
believe
i
was
going
to
meet
with
a
wild
boar
as
the
late
m
du
vallon
my
father
did
well
said
aramis
well
having
this
weakness
my
father
insisted
upon
going
down
into
the
garden
instead
of
going
to
bed
his
foot
slipped
on
the
first
stair
the
staircase
was
steep
my
father
fell
against
a
stone
in
which
an
iron
hinge
was
fixed
the
hinge
gashed
his
temple
and
he
was
stretched
out
dead
upon
the
spot
aramis
raised
his
eyes
to
his
friend
these
are
two
extraordinary
circumstances
said
he
let
us
not
infer
that
there
may
succeed
a
third
it
is
not
becoming
in
a
man
of
your
strength
to
be
superstitious
my
brave
porthos
besides
when
were
your
legs
known
to
fail
never
have
you
stood
so
firm
so
haughtily
why
you
could
carry
a
house
on
your
shoulders
at
this
moment
said
porthos
i
feel
myself
pretty
active
but
at
times
i
vacillate
i
sink
and
lately
this
phenomenon
as
you
say
has
occurred
four
times
i
will
not
say
this
frightens
me
but
it
annoys
me
life
is
an
agreeable
thing
i
have
money
i
have
fine
estates
i
have
horses
that
i
love
i
have
also
friends
that
i
love
dartagnan
athos
raoul
and
you
the
admirable
porthos
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
dissimulate
in
the
very
presence
of
aramis
the
rank
he
gave
him
in
his
friendship
aramis
pressed
his
hand
we
will
still
live
many
years
said
he
to
preserve
to
the
world
such
specimens
of
its
rarest
men
trust
yourself
to
me
my
friend
we
have
no
reply
from
dartagnan
that
is
a
good
sign
he
must
have
given
orders
to
get
the
vessels
together
and
clear
the
seas
on
my
part
i
have
just
issued
directions
that
a
bark
should
be
rolled
on
rollers
to
the
mouth
of
the
great
cavern
of
locmaria
which
you
know
where
we
have
so
often
lain
in
wait
for
the
foxes
yes
and
which
terminates
at
the
little
creek
by
a
trench
where
we
discovered
the
day
that
splendid
fox
escaped
that
way
precisely
in
case
of
misfortunes
a
bark
is
to
be
concealed
for
us
in
that
cavern
indeed
it
must
be
there
by
this
time
we
will
wait
for
a
favorable
moment
and
during
the
night
we
will
go
to
sea
that
is
a
grand
idea
what
shall
we
gain
by
it
we
shall
gain
thisnobody
knows
that
grotto
or
rather
its
issue
except
ourselves
and
two
or
three
hunters
of
the
island
we
shall
gain
thisthat
if
the
island
is
occupied
the
scouts
seeing
no
bark
upon
the
shore
will
never
imagine
we
can
escape
and
will
cease
to
watch
i
understand
well
that
weakness
in
the
legs
oh
better
much
just
now
you
see
then
plainly
that
everything
conspires
to
give
us
quietude
and
hope
dartagnan
will
sweep
the
sea
and
leave
us
free
no
royal
fleet
or
descent
to
be
dreaded
vive
dieu
porthos
we
have
still
half
a
century
of
magnificent
adventure
before
us
and
if
i
once
touch
spanish
ground
i
swear
to
you
added
the
bishop
with
terrible
energy
that
your
brevet
of
duke
is
not
such
a
chance
as
it
is
said
to
be
we
live
by
hope
said
porthos
enlivened
by
the
warmth
of
his
companion
all
at
once
a
cry
resounded
in
their
ears
to
arms
to
arms
this
cry
repeated
by
a
hundred
throats
piercing
the
chamber
where
the
two
friends
were
conversing
carried
surprise
to
one
and
uneasiness
to
the
other
aramis
opened
the
window
he
saw
a
crowd
of
people
running
with
flambeaux
women
were
seeking
places
of
safety
the
armed
population
were
hastening
to
their
posts
the
fleet
the
fleet
cried
a
soldier
who
recognized
aramis
the
fleet
repeated
the
latter
within
half
cannonshot
continued
the
soldier
to
arms
cried
aramis
to
arms
repeated
porthos
formidably
and
both
rushed
forth
towards
the
mole
to
place
themselves
within
the
shelter
of
the
batteries
boats
laden
with
soldiers
were
seen
approaching
and
in
three
directions
for
the
purpose
of
landing
at
three
points
at
once
what
must
be
done
said
an
officer
of
the
guard
stop
them
and
if
they
persist
fire
said
aramis
five
minutes
later
the
cannonade
commenced
these
were
the
shots
that
dartagnan
had
heard
as
he
landed
in
france
but
the
boats
were
too
near
the
mole
to
allow
the
cannon
to
aim
correctly
they
landed
and
the
combat
commenced
hand
to
hand
whats
the
matter
porthos
said
aramis
to
his
friend
nothing
nothingonly
my
legs
it
is
really
incomprehensiblethey
will
be
better
when
we
charge
in
fact
porthos
and
aramis
did
charge
with
such
vigor
and
so
thoroughly
animated
their
men
that
the
royalists
reembarked
precipitately
without
gaining
anything
but
the
wounds
they
carried
away
eh
but
porthos
cried
aramis
we
must
have
a
prisoner
quick
quick
porthos
bent
over
the
stair
of
the
mole
and
seized
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
one
of
the
officers
of
the
royal
army
who
was
waiting
to
embark
till
all
his
people
should
be
in
the
boat
the
arm
of
the
giant
lifted
up
his
prey
which
served
him
as
a
buckler
and
he
recovered
himself
without
a
shot
being
fired
at
him
here
is
a
prisoner
for
you
said
porthos
coolly
to
aramis
well
cried
the
latter
laughing
did
you
not
calumniate
your
legs
it
was
not
with
my
legs
i
captured
him
said
porthos
it
was
with
my
arms
chapter
xlvi
the
son
of
biscarrat
the
bretons
of
the
isle
were
very
proud
of
this
victory
aramis
did
not
encourage
them
in
the
feeling
what
will
happen
said
he
to
porthos
when
everybody
was
gone
home
will
be
that
the
anger
of
the
king
will
be
roused
by
the
account
of
the
resistance
and
that
these
brave
people
will
be
decimated
or
shot
when
they
are
taken
which
cannot
fail
to
take
place
from
which
it
results
then
said
porthos
that
what
we
have
done
is
of
not
the
slightest
use
for
the
moment
it
may
be
replied
the
bishop
for
we
have
a
prisoner
from
whom
we
shall
learn
what
our
enemies
are
preparing
to
do
yes
let
us
interrogate
the
prisoner
said
porthos
and
the
means
of
making
him
speak
are
very
simple
we
are
going
to
supper
we
will
invite
him
to
join
us
as
he
drinks
he
will
talk
this
was
done
the
officer
was
at
first
rather
uneasy
but
became
reassured
on
seeing
what
sort
of
men
he
had
to
deal
with
he
gave
without
having
any
fear
of
compromising
himself
all
the
details
imaginable
of
the
resignation
and
departure
of
dartagnan
he
explained
how
after
that
departure
the
new
leader
of
the
expedition
had
ordered
a
surprise
upon
belleisle
there
his
explanations
stopped
aramis
and
porthos
exchanged
a
glance
that
evinced
their
despair
no
more
dependence
to
be
placed
now
on
dartagnans
fertile
imaginationno
further
resource
in
the
event
of
defeat
aramis
continuing
his
interrogations
asked
the
prisoner
what
the
leaders
of
the
expedition
contemplated
doing
with
the
leaders
of
belleisle
the
orders
are
replied
he
to
kill
during
combat
or
hang
afterwards
porthos
and
aramis
looked
at
each
other
again
and
the
color
mounted
to
their
faces
i
am
too
light
for
the
gallows
replied
aramis
people
like
me
are
not
hung
and
i
am
too
heavy
said
porthos
people
like
me
break
the
cord
i
am
sure
said
the
prisoner
gallantly
that
we
could
have
guaranteed
you
the
exact
kind
of
death
you
preferred
a
thousand
thanks
said
aramis
seriously
porthos
bowed
one
more
cup
of
wine
to
your
health
said
he
drinking
himself
from
one
subject
to
another
the
chat
with
the
officer
was
prolonged
he
was
an
intelligent
gentleman
and
suffered
himself
to
be
led
on
by
the
charm
of
aramiss
wit
and
porthoss
cordial
bonhomie
pardon
me
said
he
if
i
address
a
question
to
you
but
men
who
are
in
their
sixth
bottle
have
a
clear
right
to
forget
themselves
a
little
address
it
cried
porthos
address

said
aramis
were
you
not
gentlemen
both
in
the
musketeers
of
the
late
king
yes
monsieur
and
amongst
the
best
of
them
if
you
please
said
porthos
that
is
true
i
should
say
even
the
best
of
all
soldiers
messieurs
if
i
did
not
fear
to
offend
the
memory
of
my
father
of
your
father
cried
aramis
do
you
know
what
my
name
is
ma
foi
no
monsieur
but
you
can
tell
us
and
i
am
called
georges
de
biscarrat
oh
cried
porthos
in
his
turn
biscarrat
do
you
remember
that
name
aramis
biscarrat
reflected
the
bishop
it
seems
to
me
try
to
recollect
monsieur
said
the
officer
pardieu
that
wont
take
me
long
said
porthos
biscarratcalled
cardinalone
of
the
four
who
interrupted
us
on
the
day
on
which
we
formed
our
friendship
with
dartagnan
sword
in
hand
precisely
gentlemen
the
only
one
cried
aramis
eagerly
we
could
not
scratch
consequently
a
capital
blade
said
the
prisoner
thats
true
most
true
exclaimed
both
friends
together
ma
foi
monsieur
biscarrat
we
are
delighted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
brave
mans
son
biscarrat
pressed
the
hands
held
out
by
the
two
musketeers
aramis
looked
at
porthos
as
much
as
to
say
here
is
a
man
who
will
help
us
and
without
delayconfess
monsieur
said
he
that
it
is
good
to
have
once
been
a
good
man
my
father
always
said
so
monsieur
confess
likewise
that
it
is
a
sad
circumstance
in
which
you
find
yourself
of
falling
in
with
men
destined
to
be
shot
or
hung
and
to
learn
that
these
men
are
old
acquaintances
in
fact
hereditary
friends
oh
you
are
not
reserved
for
such
a
frightful
fate
as
that
messieurs
and
friends
said
the
young
man
warmly
bah
you
said
so
yourself
i
said
so
just
now
when
i
did
not
know
you
but
now
that
i
know
you
i
sayyou
will
evade
this
dismal
fate
if
you
wish
howif
we
wish
echoed
aramis
whose
eyes
beamed
with
intelligence
as
he
looked
alternately
at
the
prisoner
and
porthos
provided
continued
porthos
looking
in
his
turn
with
noble
intrepidity
at
m
biscarrat
and
the
bishopprovided
nothing
disgraceful
be
required
of
us
nothing
at
all
will
be
required
of
you
gentlemen
replied
the
officerwhat
should
they
ask
of
you
if
they
find
you
they
will
kill
you
that
is
a
predetermined
thing
try
then
gentlemen
to
prevent
their
finding
you
i
dont
think
i
am
mistaken
said
porthos
with
dignity
but
it
appears
evident
to
me
that
if
they
want
to
find
us
they
must
come
and
seek
us
here
in
that
you
are
perfectly
right
my
worthy
friend
replied
aramis
constantly
consulting
with
his
looks
the
countenance
of
biscarrat
who
had
grown
silent
and
constrained
you
wish
monsieur
de
biscarrat
to
say
something
to
us
to
make
us
some
overture
and
you
dare
notis
that
true
ah
gentlemen
and
friends
it
is
because
by
speaking
i
betray
the
watchword
but
hark
i
hear
a
voice
that
frees
mine
by
dominating
it
cannon
said
porthos
cannon
and
musketry
too
cried
the
bishop
on
hearing
at
a
distance
among
the
rocks
these
sinister
reports
of
a
combat
which
they
thought
had
ceased
what
can
that
be
asked
porthos
eh
pardieu
cried
aramis
that
is
just
what
i
expected
what
is
that
that
the
attack
made
by
you
was
nothing
but
a
feint
is
not
that
true
monsieur
and
whilst
your
companions
allowed
themselves
to
be
repulsed
you
were
certain
of
effecting
a
landing
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
oh
several
monsieur
we
are
lost
then
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
quietly
lost
that
is
possible
replied
the
seigneur
de
pierrefonds
but
we
are
not
taken
or
hung
and
so
saying
he
rose
from
the
table
went
to
the
wall
and
coolly
took
down
his
sword
and
pistols
which
he
examined
with
the
care
of
an
old
soldier
who
is
preparing
for
battle
and
who
feels
that
life
in
a
great
measure
depends
upon
the
excellence
and
right
conditions
of
his
arms
at
the
report
of
the
cannon
at
the
news
of
the
surprise
which
might
deliver
up
the
island
to
the
royal
troops
the
terrified
crowd
rushed
precipitately
to
the
fort
to
demand
assistance
and
advice
from
their
leaders
aramis
pale
and
downcast
between
two
flambeaux
showed
himself
at
the
window
which
looked
into
the
principal
court
full
of
soldiers
waiting
for
orders
and
bewildered
inhabitants
imploring
succor
my
friends

a
grave
and
sonorous
voice

been
arrested
by
an
order
of
the
king
and
thrown
into
the
bastile
a
sustained
yell
of
vengeful
fury
came
floating
up
to
the
window
at
which
the
bishop
stood
and
enveloped
him
in
a
magnetic
field

the
most

of

the
crowd
collected
under

window
uttered
a
prolonged
roar
of
anger
and
terror
the
soldiers
of
louis
xiv
have
reached
the
island
continued
aramis
from
this
time
it
would
no
longer
be
a
fight
betwixt
them
and
youit

slowly
submissive
silent
ah
what
have
you
just
been
saying
my
friend
said
porthos
monsieur
said
biscarrat
to
the
bishop
you
may
save
all
these
inhabitants
but
thus
you
will
neither
save
yourself
nor
your
friend
monsieur
de
biscarrat
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
with
a
singular
accent
of
nobility
and
courtesy
monsieur
de
biscarrat
be
kind
enough
to
resume
your
liberty
i
am
very
willing
to
do
so
monsieur
but
that
would
render
us
a
service
for
when
announcing
to
the
kings
lieutenant
the
submission
of
the
islanders
you
will
perhaps
obtain
some
grace
for
us
on
informing
him
of
the
manner
in
which
that
submission
has
been
effected
grace
replied
porthos
with
flashing
eyes
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
word
aramis
touched
the
elbow
of
his
friend
roughly
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
in
the
days
of
their
youth
when
he
wanted
to
warn
porthos
that
he
had
committed
or
was
about
to
commit
a
blunder
porthos
understood
him
and
was
silent
immediately
i
will
go
messieurs
replied
biscarrat
a
little
surprised
likewise
at
the
word
grace
pronounced
by
the
haughty
musketeer
of
and
to
whom
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
had
related
with
so
much
enthusiasm
the
heroic
exploits
with
which
his
father
had
delighted
him
go
then
monsieur
biscarrat
said
aramis
bowing
to
him
and
at
parting
receive
the
expression
of
our
entire
gratitude
but
you
messieurs
you
whom
i
think
it
an
honor
to
call
my
friends
since
you
have
been
willing
to
accept
that
title
what
will
become
of
you
in
the
meantime
replied
the
officer
very
much
agitated
at
taking
leave
of
the
two
ancient
adversaries
of
his
father
we
will
wait
here
but
mon
dieuthe
order
is
precise
and
formal
i
am
bishop
of
vannes
monsieur
de
biscarrat
and
they
no
more
shoot
a
bishop
than
they
hang
a
gentleman
ah
yes
monsieuryes
monseigneur
replied
biscarrat
it
is
true
you
are
right
there
is
still
that
chance
for
you
then
i
will

to
the
commander
of
the
expedition

kings

then
messieurs
or
rather
to
meet
again
i
hope
the
worthy
officer
jumping
upon
a
horse
given
him
by
aramis
departed
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
of
cannon
which
by
surging
the
crowd
into
the
fort
had
interrupted
the
conversation
of
the
two
friends
with
their
prisoner
aramis
watched
the
departure
and
when
left
alone
with
porthos
well
do
you
comprehend
said
he
ma
foi
no
did
not
biscarrat
inconvenience
you
here
no
he
is
a
brave
fellow
yes
but
the
grotto
of
locmariais
it
necessary
all
the
world
should
know
it
ah
that
is
true
that
is
true
i
comprehend
we
are
going
to
escape
by
the
cavern
if
you
please
cried
aramis
gayly
forward

the
grotto
of
locmaria
the
cavern
of
locmaria
was
sufficiently
distant
from
the
mole
to
render
it
necessary
for
our
friends
to
husband
their
strength
in
order
to
reach
it
besides
night
was
advancing
midnight
had
struck
at
the
fort
porthos
and
aramis
were
loaded
with
money
and
arms
they
walked
then
across
the
heath
which
stretched
between
the
mole
and
the
cavern
listening
to
every
noise
in
order
better
to
avoid
an
ambush
from
time
to
time
on
the
road
which
they
had
carefully
left
on
their
left
passed
fugitives
coming
from
the
interior
at
the
news
of
the
landing
of
the
royal
troops
aramis
and
porthos
concealed
behind
some
projecting
mass
of
rock
collected
the
words
that
escaped
from
the
poor
people
who
fled
trembling
carrying
with
them
their
most
valuable
effects
and
tried
whilst
listening
to
their
complaints
to
gather
something
from
them
for
their
own
interest
at
length
after
a
rapid
race
frequently
interrupted
by
prudent
stoppages
they
reached
the
deep
grottoes
in
which
the
prophetic
bishop
of
vannes
had
taken
care
to
have
secreted
a
bark
capable
of
keeping
the
sea
at
this
fine
season
my
good
friend
said
porthos
panting
vigorously
we
have
arrived
it
seems
but
i
thought
you
spoke
of
three
men
three
servants
who
were
to
accompany
us
i
dont
see
themwhere
are
they
why
should
you
see
them
porthos
replied
aramis
they
are
certainly
waiting
for
us
in
the
cavern
and
no
doubt
are
resting
having
accomplished
their
rough
and
difficult
task
aramis
stopped
porthos
who
was
preparing
to
enter
the
cavern
will
you
allow
me
my
friend
said
he
to
the
giant
to
pass
in
first
i
know
the
signal
i
have
given
to
these
men
who
not
hearing
it
would
be
very
likely
to
fire
upon
you
or
slash
away
with
their
knives
in
the
dark
go
on
then
aramis
go
ongo
first
you
impersonate
wisdom
and
foresight
go
ah
there
is
that
fatigue
again
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
it
has
just
seized
me
afresh
aramis
left
porthos
sitting
at
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
and
bowing
his
head
he
penetrated
into
the
interior
of
the
cavern
imitating
the
cry
of
the
owl
a
little
plaintive
cooing
a
scarcely
distinct
echo
replied
from
the
depths
of
the
cave
aramis
pursued
his
way
cautiously
and
soon
was
stopped
by
the
same
kind
of
cry
as
he
had
first
uttered
within
ten
paces
of
him
are
you
there
yves
said
the
bishop
yes
monseigneur
goenne
is
here
likewise
his
son
accompanies
us
that
is
well
are
all
things
ready
yes
monseigneur
go
to
the
entrance
of
the
grottoes
my
good
yves
and
you
will
there
find
the
seigneur
de
pierrefonds
who
is
resting
after
the
fatigue
of
our
journey
and
if
he
should
happen
not
to
be
able
to
walk
lift
him
up
and
bring
him
hither
to
me
the
three
men
obeyed
but
the
recommendation
given
to
his
servants
was
superfluous
porthos
refreshed
had
already
commenced
the
descent
and
his
heavy
step
resounded
amongst
the
cavities
formed
and
supported
by
columns
of
porphyry
and
granite
as
soon
as
the
seigneur
de
bracieux
had
rejoined
the
bishop
the
bretons
lighted
a
lantern
with
which
they
were
furnished
and
porthos
assured
his
friend
that
he
felt
as
strong
again
as
ever
let
us
inspect
the
boat
said
aramis
and
satisfy
ourselves
at
once
what
it
will
hold
do
not
go
too
near
with
the
light
said
the
patron
yves
for
as
you
desired
me
monseigneur
i
have
placed
under
the
bench
of
the
poop
in
the
coffer
you
know
of
the
barrel
of
powder
and
the
musketcharges
that
you
sent
me
from
the
fort
very
well
said
aramis
and
taking
the
lantern
himself
he
examined
minutely
all
parts
of
the
canoe
with
the
precautions
of
a
man
who
is
neither
timid
nor
ignorant
in
the
face
of
danger
the
canoe
was
long
light
drawing
little
water
thin
of
keel
in
short
one
of
those
that
have
always
been
so
aptly
built
at
belleisle
a
little
high
in
its
sides
solid
upon
the
water
very
manageable
furnished
with
planks
which
in
uncertain
weather
formed
a
sort
of
deck
over
which
the
waves
might
glide
so
as
to
protect
the
rowers
in
two
wellclosed
coffers
placed
beneath
the
benches
of
the
prow
and
the
poop
aramis
found
bread
biscuit
dried
fruits
a
quarter
of
bacon
a
good
provision
of
water
in
leathern
bottles
the
whole
forming
rations
sufficient
for
people
who
did
not
mean
to
quit
the
coast
and
would
be
able
to
revictual
if
necessity
commanded
the
arms
eight
muskets
and
as
many
horsepistols
were
in
good
condition
and
all
loaded
there
were
additional
oars
in
case
of
accident
and
that
little
sail
called
trinquet
which
assists
the
speed
of
the
canoe
at
the
same
time
the
boatmen
row
and
is
so
useful
when
the
breeze
is
slack
when
aramis
had
seen
to
all
these
things
and
appeared
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
inspection
let
us
consult
porthos
said
he
to
know
if
we
must
endeavor
to
get
the
boat
out
by
the
unknown
extremity
of
the
grotto
following
the
descent
and
the
shade
of
the
cavern
or
whether
it
be
better
in
the
open
air
to
make
it
slide
upon
its
rollers
through
the
bushes
leveling
the
road
of
the
little
beach
which
is
but
twenty
feet
high
and
gives
at
high
tide
three
or
four
fathoms
of
good
water
upon
a
sound
bottom
it
must
be
as
you
please
monseigneur
replied
the
skipper
yves
respectfully
but
i
dont
believe
that
by
the
slope
of
the
cavern
and
in
the
dark
in
which
we
shall
be
obliged
to
maneuver
our
boat
the
road
will
be
so
convenient
as
the
open
air
i
know
the
beach
well
and
can
certify
that
it
is
as
smooth
as
a
grassplot
in
a
garden
the
interior
of
the
grotto
on
the
contrary
is
rough
without
reckoning
monseigneur
that
at
its
extremity
we
shall
come
to
the
trench
which
leads
into
the
sea
and
perhaps
the
canoe
will
not
pass
down
it
i
have
made
my
calculation
said
the
bishop
and
i
am
certain
it
will
pass
so
be
it
i
wish
it
may
monseigneur
continued
yves
but
your
highness
knows
very
well
that
to
make
it
reach
the
extremity
of
the
trench
there
is
an
enormous
stone
to
be
liftedthat
under
which
the
fox
always
passes
and
which
closes
the
trench
like
a
door
it
can
be
raised
said
porthos
that
is
nothing
oh
i
know
that
monseigneur
has
the
strength
of
ten
men
replied
yves
but
that
is
giving
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
think
the
skipper
may
be
right
said
aramis
let
us
try
the
openair
passage
the
more
so
monseigneur
continued
the
fisherman
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
embark
before
day
it
will
require
so
much
labor
and
that
as
soon
as
daylight
appears
a
good
vedette
placed
outside
the
grotto
would
be
necessary
indispensable
even
to
watch
the
maneuvers
of
the
lighters
or
cruisers
that
are
on
the
lookout
for
us
yes
yes
yves
your
reasons
are
good
we
will
go
by
the
beach
and
the
three
robust
bretons
went
to
the
boat
and
were
beginning
to
place
their
rollers
underneath
it
to
put
it
in
motion
when
the
distant
barking
of
dogs
was
heard
proceeding
from
the
interior
of
the
island
aramis
darted
out
of
the
grotto
followed
by
porthos
dawn
just
tinted
with
purple
and
white
the
waves
and
plain
through
the
dim
light
melancholy
firtrees
waved
their
tender
branches
over
the
pebbles
and
long
flights
of
crows
were
skimming
with
their
black
wings
the
shimmering
fields
of
buckwheat
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
would
be
clear
daylight
the
wakened
birds
announced
it
to
all
nature
the
barkings
which
had
been
heard
which
had
stopped
the
three
fishermen
engaged
in
moving
the
boat
and
had
brought
aramis
and
porthos
out
of
the
cavern
now
seemed
to
come
from
a
deep
gorge
within
about
a
league
of
the
grotto
it
is
a
pack
of
hounds
said
porthos
the
dogs
are
on
a
scent
who
can
be
hunting
at
such
a
moment
as
this
said
aramis
and
this
way
particularly
continued
porthos
where
they
might
expect
the
army
of
the
royalists
the
noise
comes
nearer
yes
you
are
right
porthos
the
dogs
are
on
a
scent
but
yves
cried
aramis
come
here
come
here
yves
ran
towards
him
letting
fall
the
cylinder
which
he
was
about
to
place
under
the
boat
when
the
bishops
call
interrupted
him
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
hunt
skipper
said
porthos
eh
monseigneur
i
cannot
understand
it
replied
the
breton
it
is
not
at
such
a
moment
that
the
seigneur
de
locmaria
would
hunt
no
and
yet
the
dogs
unless
they
have
escaped
from
the
kennel
no
said
goenne
they
are
not
the
seigneur
de
locmarias
hounds
in
common
prudence
said
aramis
let
us
go
back
into
the
grotto
the
voices
evidently
draw
nearer
we
shall
soon
know
what
we
have
to
trust
to
they
reentered
but
had
scarcely
proceeded
a
hundred
steps
in
the
darkness
when
a
noise
like
the
hoarse
sigh
of
a
creature
in
distress
resounded
through
the
cavern
and
breathless
rapid
terrified
a
fox
passed
like
a
flash
of
lightning
before
the
fugitives
leaped
over
the
boat
and
disappeared
leaving
behind
its
sour
scent
which
was
perceptible
for
several
seconds
under
the
low
vaults
of
the
cave
the
fox
cried
the
bretons
with
the
glad
surprise
of
born
hunters
accursed
mischance
cried
the
bishop
our
retreat
is
discovered
how
so
said
porthos
are
you
afraid
of
a
fox
eh
my
friend
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
do
you
specify
the
fox
it
is
not
the
fox
alone
pardieu
but
dont
you
know
porthos
that
after
the
foxes
come
hounds
and
after
hounds
men
porthos
hung
his
head
as
though
to
confirm
the
words
of
aramis
they
heard
the
yelping
pack
approach
with
frightful
swiftness
upon
the
trail
six
foxhounds
burst
at
once
upon
the
little
heath
with
mingling
yelps
of
triumph
there
are
the
dogs
plain
enough
said
aramis
posted
on
the
lookout
behind
a
chink
in
the
rocks
now
who
are
the
huntsmen
if
it
is
the
seigneur
de
locmarias
replied
the
sailor
he
will
leave
the
dogs
to
hunt
the
grotto
for
he
knows
them
and
will
not
enter
in
himself
being
quite
sure
that
the
fox
will
come
out
the
other
side
it
is
there
he
will
wait
for
him
it

the
seigneur
de
locmaria
who
is
hunting
replied
aramis
turning
pale
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
maintain
a
placid
countenance
who
is
it
then
said
porthos
look
porthos
applied
his
eye
to
the
slit
and
saw
at
the
summit
of
a
hillock
a
dozen
horsemen
urging
on
their
horses
in
the
track
of
the
dogs
shouting
taiaut
taiaut
the
guards
said

yes
my
friend
the

guards
the
kings
guards
do
you
say
monseigneur
cried
the
bretons
growing
pale
in
turn
with
biscarrat
at
their
head
mounted
upon
my
gray
horse
continued
aramis
the
hounds
at
the
same
moment
rushed
into
the
grotto
like
an
avalanche
and
the
depths
of
the
cavern
were
filled
with
their
deafening
cries
ah
the
devil
said
aramis
resuming
all
his
coolness
at
the
sight
of
this
certain
inevitable
danger
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
we
are
lost
but
we
have
at
least
one
chance
left
if
the
guards
who
follow
their
hounds
happen
to
discover
there
is
an
issue
to
the
grotto
there
is
no
help
for
us
for
on
entering
they
must
see
both
ourselves
and
our
boat
the
dogs
must
not
go
out
of
the
cavern
their
masters
must
not
enter
that
is
clear
said
porthos
you
understand
added
aramis
with
the
rapid
precision
of
command
there
are
six
dogs
that
will
be
forced
to
stop
at
the
great
stone
under
which
the
fox
has
glidedbut
at
the
too
narrow
opening
of
which
they
must
be
themselves
stopped
and
killed
the
bretons
sprang
forward
knife
in
hand
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
lamentable
concert
of
angry
barks
and
mortal
howlsand
then
silence
thats
well
said
aramis
coolly
now
for
the
masters
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
said
porthos
wait
their
arrival
conceal
ourselves
and
kill
them
kill
them
replied
porthos
there
are
sixteen
said
aramis
at
least
at
present
and
well
armed
added
porthos
with
a
smile
of
consolation
it
will
last
about
ten
minutes
said
aramis
to
work
and
with
a
resolute
air
he
took
up
a
musket
and
placed
a
huntingknife
between
his
teeth
yves
goenne
and
his
son
continued
aramis
will
pass
the
muskets
to
us
you
porthos
will
fire
when
they
are
close
we
shall
have
brought
down
at
the
lowest
computation
eight
before
the
others
are
aware
of
anythingthat
is
certain
then
all
there
are
five
of
us
will
dispatch
the
other
eight

in
hand
and
poor

the
grotto
in
spite
of
the
sort
of
divination
which
was
the
remarkable
side
of
the
character
of
aramis
the
event
subject
to
the
risks
of
things
over
which
uncertainty
presides
did
not
fall
out
exactly
as
the
bishop
of
vannes
had
foreseen
biscarrat
better
mounted
than
his
companions
arrived
first
at
the
opening
of
the
grotto
and
comprehended
that
fox
and
hounds
were
one
and
all
engulfed
in
it
only
struck
by
that
superstitious
terror
which
every
dark
and
subterraneous
way
naturally
impresses
upon
the
mind
of
man
he
stopped
at
the
outside
of
the
grotto
and
waited
till
his
companions
should
have
assembled
round
him
well
asked
the
young
men
coming
up
out
of
breath
and
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
this
inaction
well
i
cannot
hear
the
dogs
they
and
the
fox
must
all
be
lost
in
this
infernal
cavern
they
were
too
close
up
said
one
of
the
guards
to
have
lost
scent
all
at
once
besides
we
should
hear
them
from
one
side
or
another
they
must
as
biscarrat
says
be
in
this
grotto
but
then
said
one
of
the
young
men
why
dont
they
give
tongue
it
is
strange
muttered
another
well
but
said
a
fourth
let
us
go
into
this
grotto
does
it
happen
to
be
forbidden
we
should
enter
it
no
replied
biscarrat
only
as
it
looks
as
dark
as
a
wolfs
mouth
we
might
break
our
necks
in
it
witness
the
dogs
said
a
guard
who
seem
to
have
broken
theirs
what
the
devil
can
have
become
of
them
asked
the
young
men
in
chorus
and
every
master
called
his
dog
by
his
name
whistled
to
him
in
his
favorite
mode
without
a
single
one
replying
to
either
call
or
whistle
it
is
perhaps
an
enchanted
grotto
said
biscarrat
let
us
see
and
jumping
from
his
horse
he
made
a
step
into
the
grotto
stop
stop
i
will
accompany
you
said
one
of
the
guards
on
seeing
biscarrat
disappear
in
the
shades
of
the
caverns
mouth
no
replied
biscarrat
there
must
be
something
extraordinary
in
the
placedont
let
us
risk
ourselves
all
at
once
if
in
ten
minutes
you
do
not
hear
of
me
you
can
come
in
but
not
all
at
once
be
it
so
said
the
young
man
who
besides
did
not
imagine
that
biscarrat
ran
much
risk
in
the
enterprise
we
will
wait
for
you
and
without
dismounting
from
their
horses
they
formed
a
circle
round
the
grotto
biscarrat
entered
then
alone
and
advanced
through
the
darkness
till
he
came
in
contact
with
the
muzzle
of
porthoss
musket
the
resistance
which
his
chest
met
with
astonished
him
he
naturally
raised
his
hand
and
laid
hold
of
the
icy
barrel
at
the
same
instant
yves
lifted
a
knife
against
the
young
man
which
was
about
to
fall
upon
him
with
all
force
of
a
bretons
arm
when
the
iron
wrist
of
porthos
stopped
it
halfway
then
like
low
muttering
thunder
his
voice
growled
in
the
darkness
i
will
not
have
him
killed
biscarrat
found
himself
between
a
protection
and
a
threat
the
one
almost
as
terrible
as
the
other
however
brave
the
young
man
might
be
he
could
not
prevent
a
cry
escaping
him
which
aramis
immediately
suppressed
by
placing
a
handkerchief
over
his
mouth
monsieur
de
biscarrat
said
he
in
a
low
voice
we
mean
you
no
harm
and
you
must
know
that
if
you
have
recognized
us
but
at
the
first
word
the
first
groan
the
first
whisper
we
shall
be
forced
to
kill
you
as
we
have
killed
your
dogs
yes
i
recognize
you
gentlemen
said
the
officer
in
a
low
voice
but
why
are
you
herewhat
are
you
doing
here
unfortunate
men
i
thought
you
were
in
the
fort
and
you
monsieur
you
were
to
obtain
conditions
for
us
i
think
i
did
all
i
was
able
messieurs
but
but
what
but
there
are
positive
orders
to
kill
us
biscarrat
made
no
reply
it
would
have
cost
him
too
much
to
speak
of
the
cord
to
gentlemen
aramis
understood
the
silence
of
the
prisoner
monsieur
biscarrat
said
he
you
would
be
already
dead
if
we
had
not
regard
for
your
youth
and
our
ancient
association
with
your
father
but
you
may
yet
escape
from
the
place
by
swearing
that
you
will
not
tell
your
companions
what
you
have
seen
i
will
not
only
swear
that
i
will
not
speak
of
it
said
biscarrat
but
i
still
further
swear
that
i
will
do
everything
in
the
world
to
prevent
my
companions
from
setting
foot
in
the
grotto
biscarrat
biscarrat
cried
several
voices
from
the
outside
coming
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
cave
reply
said
aramis
here
i
am
cried
biscarrat
now
begone
we
depend
on
your
loyalty
and
he
left
his
hold
of
the
young
man
who
hastily
returned
towards
the
light
biscarrat
biscarrat
cried
the
voices
still
nearer
and
the
shadows
of
several
human
forms
projected
into
the
interior
of
the
grotto
biscarrat
rushed
to
meet
his
friends
in
order
to
stop
them
and
met
them
just
as
they
were
adventuring
into
the
cave
aramis
and
porthos
listened
with
the
intense
attention
of
men
whose
life
depends
upon
a
breath
of
air
oh
oh
exclaimed
one
of
the
guards
as
he
came
to
the
light
how
pale
you
are
pale
cried
another
you
ought
to
say
corpsecolor
i
said
the
young
man
endeavoring
to
collect
his
faculties
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
has
happened
exclaimed
all
the
voices
you
have
not
a
drop
of
blood
in
your
veins
my
poor
friend
said
one
of
them
laughing
messieurs
it
is
serious
said
another
he
is
going
to
faint
does
any
one
of
you
happen
to
have
any
salts
and
they
all
laughed
this
hail
of
jests
fell
round
biscarrats
ears
like
musketballs
in
a
melee
he
recovered
himself
amidst
a
deluge
of
interrogations
what
do
you
suppose
i
have
seen
asked
he
i
was
too
hot
when
i
entered
the
grotto
and
i
have
been
struck
with
a
chill
that
is
all
but
the
dogs
the
dogs
have
you
seen
them
againdid
you
see
anything
of
themdo
you
know
anything
about
them
i
suppose
they
have
got
out
some
other
way
messieurs
said
one
of
the
young
men
there
is
in
that
which
is
going
on
in
the
paleness
and
silence
of
our
friend
a
mystery
which
biscarrat
will
not
or
cannot
reveal
only
and
this
is
certain
biscarrat
has
seen
something
in
the
grotto
well
for
my
part
i
am
very
curious
to
see
what
it
is
even
if
it
is
the
devil
to
the
grotto
messieurs
to
the
grotto
to
the
grotto
repeated
all
the
voices
and
the
echo
of
the
cavern
carried
like
a
menace
to
porthos
and
aramis
to
the
grotto
to
the
grotto
biscarrat
threw
himself
before
his
companions
messieurs
messieurs
cried
he
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
not
go
in
why
what
is
there
so
terrific
in
the
cavern
asked
several
at
once
come
speak
biscarrat
decidedly
it
is
the
devil
he
has
seen
repeated
he
who
had
before
advanced
that
hypothesis
well
said
another
if
he
has
seen
him
he
need
not
be
selfish
he
may
as
well
let
us
have
a
look
at
him
in
turn
messieurs
messieurs
i
beseech
you
urged
biscarrat
nonsense
let
us
pass
messieurs
i
implore
you
not
to
enter
why
you
went
in
yourself
then
one
of
the
officers
whoof
a
riper
age
than
the
othershad
till
this
time
remained
behind
and
had
said
nothing
advanced
messieurs
said
he
with
a
calmness
which
contrasted
with
the
animation
of
the
young
men
there
is
in
there
some
person
or
something
that
is
not
the
devil
but
which
whatever
it
may
be
has
had
sufficient
power
to
silence
our
dogs
we
must
discover
who
this
some
one
is
or
what
this
something
is
biscarrat
made
a
last
effort
to
stop
his
friends
but
it
was
useless
in
vain
he
threw
himself
before
the
rashest
in
vain
he
clung
to
the
rocks
to
bar
the
passage
the
crowd
of
young
men
rushed
into
the
cave
in
the
steps
of
the
officer
who
had
spoken
last
but
who
had
sprung
in
first
sword
in
hand
to
face
the
unknown
danger
biscarrat
repulsed
by
his
friends
unable
to
accompany
them
without
passing
in
the
eyes
of
porthos
and
aramis
for
a
traitor
and
a
perjurer
with
painfully
attentive
ear
and
unconsciously
supplicating
hands
leaned
against
the
rough
side
of
a
rock
which
he
thought
must
be
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
musketeers
as
to
the
guards
they
penetrated
further
and
further
with
exclamations
that
grew
fainter
as
they
advanced
all
at
once
a
discharge
of
musketry
growling
like
thunder
exploded
in
the
entrails
of
the
vault
two
or
three
balls
were
flattened
against
the
rock
on
which
biscarrat
was
leaning
at
the
same
instant
cries
shrieks
imprecations
burst
forth
and
the
little
troop
of
gentlemen
reappearedsome
pale
some
bleedingall
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
which
the
outer
air
seemed
to
suck
from
the
depths
of
the
cavern
biscarrat
biscarrat
cried
the
fugitives
you
knew
there
was
an
ambuscade
in
that
cavern
and
you
did
not
warn
us

you
are
the

that
four
of
us
are
murdered

woe
be
to
you

you
are
the
cause

my
being
wounded
unto
death

of

gush

face
my
blood
be
on
your
head
and
he
rolled
in
agony
at
the
feet
of
the
young
man
but
at
least
tell
us
who
is
there
cried
several
furious
voices
biscarrat
remained
silent
tell
us
or
die
cried
the
wounded
man
raising
himself
upon
one
knee
and
lifting
towards
his
companion
an
arm
bearing
a
useless
sword
biscarrat
rushed
towards
him
opening
his
breast
for
the
blow
but
the
wounded
man
fell
back
not
to
rise
again
uttering
a
groan
which
was
his
last
biscarrat
with
hair
on
end
haggard
eyes
and
bewildered
head
advanced
towards
the
interior
of
the
cavern
saying
you
are
right
death
to
me
who
have
allowed
my
comrades
to
be
assassinated
i
am
a
worthless
wretch
and
throwing
away
his
sword
for
he
wished
to
die
without
defending
himself
he
rushed
head
foremost
into
the
cavern
the
others
followed
him
the
eleven
who
remained
out
of
sixteen
imitated
his
example
but
they
did
not
go
further
than
the
first
a
second
discharge
laid
five
upon
the
icy
sand
and
as
it
was
impossible
to
see
whence
this
murderous
thunder
issued
the
others
fell
back
with
a
terror
that
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
but
far
from
flying
as
the
others
had
done
biscarrat
remained
safe
and
sound
seated
on
a
fragment
of
rock
and
waited
there
were
only
six
gentlemen
left
seriously
said
one
of
the
survivors
is
it
the
devil
ma
foi
it
is
much
worse
said
another
ask
biscarrat
he
knows
where
is
biscarrat
the
young
men
looked
round
them
and
saw
that
biscarrat
did
not
answer
he
is
dead
said
two
or
three
voices
oh
no
replied
another
i
saw
him
through
the
smoke
sitting
quietly
on
a
rock
he
is
in
the
cavern
he
is
waiting
for
us
he
must
know
who
are
there
and
how
should
he
know
them
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
rebels
that
is
true
well
let
us
call
him
and
learn
from
him
whom
we
have
to
deal
with
and
all
voices
shouted
biscarrat
biscarrat
but
biscarrat
did
not
answer
good
said
the
officer
who
had
shown
so
much
coolness
in
the
affair
we
have
no
longer
any
need
of
him
here
are
reinforcements
coming
in
fact
a
company
of
guards
left
in
the
rear
by
their
officers
whom
the
ardor
of
the
chase
had
carried
awayfrom
seventyfive
to
eighty
menarrived
in
good
order
led
by
their
captain
and
the
first
lieutenant
the
five
officers
hastened
to
meet
their
soldiers
and
in
language
the
eloquence
of
which
may
be
easily
imagined
they
related
the
adventure
and
asked
for
aid
the
captain
interrupted
them
where
are
your
companions
demanded
he
dead
but
there
were
sixteen
of
you
ten
are
dead
biscarrat
is
in
the
cavern
and
we
are
five
biscarrat
is
a
prisoner
probably
no
for
here
he
islook
in
fact
biscarrat
appeared
at
the
opening
of
the
grotto
he
is
making
a
sign
to
come
on
said
the
officer
come
on
come
on
cried
all
the
troop
and
they
advanced
to
meet
biscarrat
monsieur
said
the
captain
addressing
biscarrat
i
am
assured
that
you
know
who
the
men
are
in
that
grotto
and
who
make
such
a
desperate
defense
in
the
kings
name
i
command
you
to
declare
what
you
know
captain
said
biscarrat
you
have
no
need
to
command
me
my
word
has
been
restored
to
me
this
very
instant
and
i
came
in
the
name
of
these
men
to
tell
me
who
they
are
to
tell
you
they
are
determined
to
defend
themselves
to
the
death
unless
you
grant
them
satisfactory
terms
how
many
are
there
of
them
then
there
are
two
said
biscarrat
there
are
twoand
want
to
impose
conditions
upon
us
there
are
two
and
they
have
already
killed
ten
of
our
men
what
sort
of
people
are
theygiants
worse
than
that
do
you
remember
the
history
of
the
bastion
saintgervais
captain
yes
where
four
musketeers
held
out
against
an
army
well
these
are
two
of
those
same
musketeers
and
their
names
at
that
period
they
were
called
porthos
and
aramis
now
they
are
styled
m
dherblay
and
m
du
vallon
and
what
interest
have
they
in
all
this
it
is
they
who
were
holding
bellisle
for
m
fouquet
a
murmur
ran
through
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
on
hearing
the
two
words
porthos
and
aramis
the
musketeers
the
musketeers
repeated
they
and
among
all
these
brave
men
the
idea
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
struggle
against
two
of
the
oldest
glories
of
the
french
army
made
a
shiver
half
enthusiasm
twothirds
terror
run
through
them
in
fact
those
four
namesdartagnan
athos
porthos
and
aramiswere
venerated
among
all
who
wore
a
sword
as
in
antiquity
the
names
of
hercules
theseus
castor
and
pollux
were
venerated
two
menand
they
have
killed
ten
in
two
discharges
it
is
impossible
monsieur
biscarrat
eh
captain
replied
the
latter
i
do
not
tell
you
that
they
have
not
with
them
two
or
three
men
as
the
musketeers
of
the
bastion
saintgervais
had
two
or
three
lackeys
but
believe
me
captain
i
have
seen
these
men
i
have
been
taken
prisoner
by
themi
know
they
themselves
alone
are
allsufficient
to
destroy
an
army
that
we
shall
see
said
the
captain
and
that
in
a
moment
too
gentlemen
attention
at
this
reply
no
one
stirred
and
all
prepared
to
obey
biscarrat
alone
risked
a
last
attempt
monsieur
said
he
in
a
low
voice
be
persuaded
by
me
let
us
pass
on
our
way
those
two
men
those
two
lions
you
are
going
to
attack
will
defend
themselves
to
the
death
they
have
already
killed
ten
of
our
men
they
will
kill
double
the
number
and
end
by
killing
themselves
rather
than
surrender
what
shall
we
gain
by
fighting
them
we
shall
gain
the
consciousness
monsieur
of
not
having
allowed
eighty
of
the
kings
guards
to
retire
before
two
rebels
if
i
listened
to
your
advice
monsieur
i
should
be
a
dishonored
man
and
by
dishonoring
myself
i
should
dishonor
the
army
forward
my
men
and
he
marched
first
as
far
as
the
opening
of
the
grotto
there
he
halted
the
object
of
this
halt
was
to
give
biscarrat
and
his
companions
time
to
describe
to
him
the
interior
of
the
grotto
then
when
he
believed
he
had
a
sufficient
acquaintance
with
the
place
he
divided
his
company
into
three
bodies
which
were
to
enter
successively
keeping
up
a
sustained
fire
in
all
directions
no
doubt
in
this
attack
they
would
lose
five
more
perhaps
ten
but
certainly
they
must
end
by
taking
the
rebels
since
there
was
no
issue
and
at
any
rate
two
men
could
not
kill
eighty
captain
said
biscarrat
i
beg
to
be
allowed
to
march
at
the
head
of
the
first
platoon
so
be
it
replied
the
captain
you
have
all
the
honor
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
thanks
replied
the
young
man
with
all
the
firmness
of
his
race
take
your
sword
then
i
shall
go
as
i
am
captain
said
biscarrat
for
i
do
not
go
to
kill
i
go
to
be
killed

himself
at

an
homeric
song
it
is
time
to
pass
to
the
other
camp
and
to
describe
at
once
the
combatants
and
the
field
of
battle
aramis
and
porthos
had
gone
to
the
grotto
of
locmaria
with
the
expectation
of
finding
there
their
canoe
ready
armed
as
well
as
the
three
bretons
their
assistants
and
they
at
first
hoped
to
make
the
bark
pass
through
the
little
issue
of
the
cavern
concealing
in
that
fashion
both
their
labors
and
their
flight
the
arrival
of
the
fox
and
dogs
obliged
them
to
remain
concealed
the
grotto
extended
the
space
of
about
a
hundred
toises
to
that
little
slope
dominating
a
creek
formerly
a
temple
of
the
celtic
divinities
when
belleisle
was
still
called
kalonese
this
grotto
had
beheld
more
than
one
human
sacrifice
accomplished
in
its
mystic
depths
the
first
entrance
to
the
cavern
was
by
a
moderate
descent
above
which
distorted
rocks
formed
a
weird
arcade
the
interior
very
uneven
and
dangerous
from
the
inequalities
of
the
vault
was
subdivided
into
several
compartments
which
communicated
with
each
other
by
means
of
rough
and
jagged
steps
fixed
right
and
left
in
uncouth
natural
pillars
at
the
third
compartment
the
vault
was
so
low
the
passage
so
narrow
that
the
bark
would
scarcely
have
passed
without
touching
the
side
nevertheless
in
moments
of
despair
wood
softens
and
stone
grows
flexible
beneath
the
human
will
such
was
the
thought
of
aramis
when
after
having
fought
the
fight
he
decided
upon
flighta
flight
most
dangerous
since
all
the
assailants
were
not
dead
and
that
admitting
the
possibility
of
putting
the
bark
to
sea
they
would
have
to
fly
in
open
day
before
the
conquered
so
interested
on
recognizing
their
small
number
in
pursuing
their
conquerors
when
the
two
discharges
had
killed
ten
men
aramis
familiar
with
the
windings
of
the
cavern
went
to
reconnoiter
them
one
by
one
and
counted
them
for
the
smoke
prevented
seeing
outside
and
he
immediately
commanded
that
the
canoe
should
be
rolled
as
far
as
the
great
stone
the
closure
of
the
liberating
issue
porthos
collected
all
his
strength
took
the
canoe
in
his
arms
and
raised
it
up
whilst
the
bretons
made
it
run
rapidly
along
the
rollers
they
had
descended
into
the
third
compartment
they
had
arrived
at
the
stone
which
walled
the
outlet
porthos
seized
this
gigantic
stone
at
its
base
applied
his
robust
shoulder
and
gave
a
heave
which
made
the
wall
crack
a
cloud
of
dust
fell
from
the
vault
with
the
ashes
of
ten
thousand
generations
of
sea
birds
whose
nests
stuck
like
cement
to
the
rock
at
the
third
shock
the
stone
gave
way
and
oscillated
for
a
minute
porthos
placing
his
back
against
the
neighboring
rock
made
an
arch
with
his
foot
which
drove
the
block
out
of
the
calcareous
masses
which
served
for
hinges
and
cramps
the
stone
fell
and
daylight
was
visible
brilliant
radiant
flooding
the
cavern
through
the
opening
and
the
blue
sea
appeared
to
the
delighted
bretons
they
began
to
lift
the
bark
over
the
barricade
twenty
more
toises
and
it
would
glide
into
the
ocean
it
was
during
this
time
that
the
company
arrived
was
drawn
up
by
the
captain
and
disposed
for
either
an
escalade
or
an
assault
aramis
watched
over
everything
to
favor
the
labors
of
his
friends
he
saw
the
reinforcements
counted
the
men
and
convinced
himself
at
a
single
glance
of
the
insurmountable
peril
to
which
fresh
combat
would
expose
them
to
escape
by
sea
at
the
moment
the
cavern
was
about
to
be
invaded
was
impossible
in
fact
the
daylight
which
had
just
been
admitted
to
the
last
compartments
had
exposed
to
the
soldiers
the
bark
being
rolled
towards
the
sea
the
two
rebels
within
musketshot
and
one
of
their
discharges
would
riddle
the
boat
if
it
did
not
kill
the
navigators
besides
allowing
everythingif
the
bark
escaped
with
the
men
on
board
of
it
how
could
the
alarm
be
suppressedhow
could
notice
to
the
royal
lighters
be
prevented
what
could
hinder
the
poor
canoe
followed
by
sea
and
watched
from
the
shore
from
succumbing
before
the
end
of
the
day
aramis
digging
his
hands
into
his
gray
hair
with
rage
invoked
the
assistance
of
god
and
the
assistance
of
the
demons
calling
to
porthos
who
was
doing
more
work
than
all
the
rollerswhether
of
flesh
or
woodmy
friend
said
he
our
adversaries
have
just
received
a
reinforcement
ah
ah
said
porthos
quietly
what
is
to
be
done
then
to
recommence
the
combat
said
aramis
is
hazardous
yes
said
porthos
for
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
out
of
two
one
should
not
be
killed
and
certainly
if
one
of
us
was
killed
the
other
would
get
himself
killed
also
porthos
spoke
these
words
with
that
heroic
nature
which
with
him
grew
grander
with
necessity
aramis
felt
it
like
a
spur
to
his
heart
we
shall
neither
of
us
be
killed
if
you
do
what
i
tell
you
friend
porthos
tell
me
what
these
people
are
coming
down
into
the
grotto
yes
we
could
kill
about
fifteen
of
them
but
no
more
how
many
are
there
in
all
asked
porthos
they
have
received
a
reinforcement
of
seventyfive
men
seventyfive
and
five
eighty
ah
sighed
porthos
if
they
fire
all
at
once
they
will
riddle
us
with
balls
certainly
they
will
without
reckoning
added
aramis
that
the
detonation
might
occasion
a
collapse
of
the
cavern
ay
said
porthos
a
piece
of
falling
rock
just
now
grazed
my
shoulder
you
see
then
oh
it
is
nothing
we
must
determine
upon
something
quickly
our
bretons
are
going
to
continue
to
roll
the
canoe
towards
the
sea
very
well
we
two
will
keep
the
powder
the
balls
and
the
muskets
here
but
only
two
my
dear
aramiswe
shall
never
fire
three
shots
together
said
porthos
innocently
the
defense
by
musketry
is
a
bad
one
find
a
better
then
i
have
found
one
said
the
giant
eagerly
i
will
place
myself
in
ambuscade
behind
the
pillar
with
this
iron
bar
and
invisible
unattackable
if
they
come
in
floods
i
can
let
my
bar
fall
upon
their
skulls
thirty
times
in
a
minute
hein
what
do
you
think
of
the
project
you
smile
excellent
dear
friend
perfect
i
approve
it
greatly
only
you
will
frighten
them
and
half
of
them
will
remain
outside
to
take
us
by
famine
what
we
want
my
good
friend
is
the
entire
destruction
of
the
troop
a
single
survivor
encompasses
our
ruin
you
are
right
my
friend
but
how
can
we
attract
them
pray
by
not
stirring
my
good
porthos
well
we
wont
stir
then
but
when
they
are
all
together
then
leave
it
to
me
i
have
an
idea
if
it
is
so
and
your
idea
proves
a
good
oneand
your
idea
is
most
likely
to
be
goodi
am
satisfied
to
your
ambuscade
porthos
and
count
how
many
enter
but
you
what
will
you
do
dont
trouble
yourself
about
me
i
have
a
task
to
perform
i
think
i
hear
shouts
it
is
they
to
your
post
keep
within
reach
of
my
voice
and
hand
porthos
took
refuge
in
the
second
compartment
which
was
in
darkness
absolutely
black
aramis
glided
into
the
third
the
giant
held
in
his
hand
an
iron
bar
of
about
fifty
pounds
weight
porthos
handled
this
lever
which
had
been
used
in
rolling
the
bark
with
marvelous
facility
during
this
time
the
bretons
had
pushed
the
bark
to
the
beach
in
the
further
and
lighter
compartment
aramis
stooping
and
concealed
was
busy
with
some
mysterious
maneuver
a
command
was
given
in
a
loud
voice
it
was
the
last
order
of
the
captain
commandant
twentyfive
men
jumped
from
the
upper
rocks
into
the
first
compartment
of
the
grotto
and
having
taken
their
ground
began
to
fire
the
echoes
shrieked
and
barked
the
hissing
balls
seemed
actually
to
rarefy
the
air
and
then
opaque
smoke
filled
the
vault
to
the
left
to
the
left
cried
biscarrat
who
in
his
first
assault
had
seen
the
passage
to
the
second
chamber
and
who
animated
by
the
smell
of
powder
wished
to
guide
his
soldiers
in
that
direction
the
troop
accordingly
precipitated
themselves
to
the
leftthe
passage
gradually
growing
narrower
biscarrat
with
his
hands
stretched
forward
devoted
to
death

in

of
the
muskets

on

on
exclaimed
he
i
see
daylight
strike
porthos
cried
the
sepulchral
voice
of
aramis
porthos
breathed
a
heavy
sighbut
he
obeyed
the
iron
bar
fell
full
and
direct
upon
the
head
of
biscarrat
who
was
dead
before
he
had
ended
his
cry
then
the
formidable
lever
rose
ten
times
in
ten
seconds
and
made
ten
corpses
the
soldiers
could
see
nothing
they
heard
sighs
and
groans
they
stumbled
over
dead
bodies
but
as
they
had
no
conception
of
the
cause
of
all
this
they
came
forward
jostling
each
other
the
implacable
bar
still
falling
annihilated
the
first
platoon
without
a
single
sound
to
warn
the
second
which
was
quietly
advancing
only
commanded
by
the
captain
the
men
had
stripped
a
fir
growing
on
the
shore
and
with
its
resinous
branches
twisted
together
the
captain
had
made
a
flambeau
on
arriving
at
the
compartment
where
porthos
like
the
exterminating
angel
had
destroyed
all
he
touched
the
first
rank
drew
back
in
terror
no
firing
had
replied
to
that
of
the
guards
and
yet
their
way
was
stopped
by
a
heap
of
dead
bodiesthey
literally
walked
in
blood
porthos
was
still
behind
his
pillar
the
captain
illumining
with
trembling
pinetorch
this
frightful
carnage
of
which
he
in
vain
sought
the
cause
drew
back
towards
the
pillar
behind
which
porthos
was
concealed
then
a
gigantic
hand
issued
from
the
shade
and
fastened
on
the
throat
of
the
captain
who
uttered
a
stifle
rattle
his
stretchedout
arms
beating
the
air
the
torch
fell
and
was
extinguished
in
blood
a
second
after
the
corpse
of
the
captain
dropped
close
to
the
extinguished
torch
and
added
another
body
to
the
heap
of
dead
which
blocked
up
the
passage
all
this
was
effected
as
mysteriously
as
though
by
magic
at
hearing
the
rattling
in
the
throat
of
the
captain
the
soldiers
who
accompanied
him
had
turned
round
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
extended
arms
his
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
and
then
the
torch
fell
and
they
were
left
in
darkness
from
an
unreflective
instinctive
mechanical
feeling
the
lieutenant
cried
fire
immediately
a
volley
of
musketry
flamed
thundered
roared
in
the
cavern
bringing
down
enormous
fragments
from
the
vaults
the
cavern
was
lighted
for
an
instant
by
this
discharge
and
then
immediately
returned
to
pitchy
darkness
rendered
thicker
by
the
smoke
to
this
succeeded
a
profound
silence
broken
only
by
the
steps
of
the
third
brigade
now
entering
the
cavern
chapter
l
the
death
of
a
titan
at
the
moment
when
porthos
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
than
these
men
coming
from
open
daylight
was
looking
round
him
to
see
if
through
this
artificial
midnight
aramis
were
not
making
him
some
signal
he
felt
his
arm
gently
touched
and
a
voice
low
as
a
breath
murmured
in
his
ear
come
oh
said
porthos
hush
said
aramis
if
possible
yet
more
softly
and
amidst
the
noise
of
the
third
brigade
which
continued
to
advance
the
imprecations
of
the
guards
still
left
alive
the
muffled
groans
of
the
dying
aramis
and
porthos
glided
unseen
along
the
granite
walls
of
the
cavern
aramis
led
porthos
into
the
last
but
one
compartment
and
showed
him
in
a
hollow
of
the
rocky
wall
a
barrel
of
powder
weighing
from
seventy
to
eighty
pounds
to
which
he
had
just
attached
a
fuse
my
friend
said
he
to
porthos
you
will
take
this
barrel
the
match
of
which
i
am
going
to
set
fire
to
and
throw
it
amidst
our
enemies
can
you
do
so
parbleu
replied
porthos
and
he
lifted
the
barrel
with
one
hand
light
it
stop
said
aramis
till
they
are
all
massed
together
and
then
my
jupiter
hurl
your
thunderbolt
among
them
light
it
repeated
porthos
on
my
part
continued
aramis
i
will
join
our
bretons
and
help
them
to
get
the
canoe
to
the
sea
i
will
wait
for
you
on
the
shore
launch
it
strongly
and
hasten
to
us
light
it
said
porthos
a
third
time
but
do
you
understand
me
parbleu
said
porthos
again
with
laughter
that
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
restrain
when
a
thing
is
explained
to
me
i
understand
it
begone
and
give
me
the
light
aramis
gave
the
burning
match
to
porthos
who
held
out
his
arm
to
him
his
hands
being
engaged
aramis
pressed
the
arm
of
porthos
with
both
his
hands
and
fell
back
to
the
outlet
of
the
cavern
where
the
three
rowers
awaited
him
porthos
left
alone
applied
the
spark
bravely
to
the
match
the
sparka
feeble
spark
first
principle
of
conflagrationshone
in
the
darkness
like
a
glowworm
then
was
deadened
against
the
match
which
it
set
fire
to
porthos
enlivening
the
flame
with
his
breath
the
smoke
was
a
little
dispersed
and
by
the
light
of
the
sparkling
match
objects
might
for
two
seconds
be
distinguished
it
was
a
brief
but
splendid
spectacle
that
of
this
giant
pale
bloody
his
countenance
lighted
by
the
fire
of
the
match
burning
in
surrounding
darkness
the
soldiers
saw
him
they
saw
the
barrel
he
held
in
his
handthey
at
once
understood
what
was
going
to
happen
then
these
men
already
choked
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
what
had
been
accomplished
filled
with
terror
at
thought
of
what
was
about
to
be
accomplished
gave
out
a
simultaneous
shriek
of
agony
some
endeavored
to
fly
but
they
encountered
the
third
brigade
which
barred
their
passage
others
mechanically
took
aim
and
attempted
to
fire
their
discharged
muskets
others
fell
instinctively
upon
their
knees
two
or
three
officers
cried
out
to
porthos
to
promise
him
his
liberty
if
he
would
spare
their
lives
the
lieutenant
of
the
third
brigade
commanded
his
men
to
fire
but
the
guards
had
before
them
their
terrified
companions
who
served
as
a
living
rampart
for
porthos
we
have
said
that
the
light
produced
by
the
spark
and
the
match
did
not
last
more
than
two
seconds
but
during
these
two
seconds
this
is
what
it
illumined
in
the
first
place
the
giant
enlarged
in
the
darkness
then
at
ten
paces
off
a
heap
of
bleeding
bodies
crushed
mutilated
in
the
midst
of
which
some
still
heaved
in
the
last
agony
lifting
the
mass
as
a
last
respiration
inflating
the
sides
of
some
old
monster
dying
in
the
night
every
breath
of
porthos
thus
vivifying
the
match
sent
towards
this
heap
of
bodies
a
phosphorescent
aura
mingled
with
streaks
of
purple
in
addition
to
this
principal
group
scattered
about
the
grotto
as
the
chances
of
death
or
surprise
had
stretched
them
isolated
bodies
seemed
to
be
making
ghastly
exhibitions
of
their
gaping
wounds
above
ground
bedded
in
pools
of
blood
rose
heavy
and
sparkling
the
short
thick
pillars
of
the
cavern
of
which
the
strongly
marked
shades
threw
out
the
luminous
particles
and
all
this
was
seen
by
the
tremulous
light
of
a
match
attached
to
a
barrel
of
powder
that
is
to
say
a
torch
which
whilst
throwing
a
light
on
the
dead
past
showed
death
to
come
as
i
have
said
this
spectacle
did
not
last
above
two
seconds
during
this
short
space
of
time
an
officer
of
the
third
brigade
got
together
eight
men
armed
with
muskets
and
through
an
opening
ordered
them
to
fire
upon
porthos
but
they
who
received
the
order
to
fire
trembled
so
that
three
guards
fell
by
the
discharge
and
the
five
remaining
balls
hissed
on
to
splinter
the
vault
plow
the
ground
or
indent
the
pillars
of
the
cavern
a
burst
of
laughter
replied
to
this
volley
then
the
arm
of
the
giant
swung
round
then
was
seen
whirling
through
the
air
like
a
falling
star
the
train
of
fire
the
barrel
hurled
a
distance
of
thirty
feet
cleared
the
barricade
of
dead
bodies
and
fell
amidst
a
group
of
shrieking
soldiers
who
threw
themselves
on
their
faces
the
officer
had
followed
the
brilliant
train
in
the
air
he
endeavored
to
precipitate
himself
upon
the
barrel
and
tear
out
the
match
before
it
reached
the
powder
it
contained
useless
the
air
had
made
the
flame
attached
to
the
conductor
more
active
the
match
which
at
rest
might
have
burnt
five
minutes
was
consumed
in
thirty
seconds
and
the
infernal
work
exploded
furious
vortices
of
sulphur
and
nitre
devouring
shoals
of
fire
which
caught
every
object
the
terrible
thunder
of
the
explosion
this
is
what
the
second
which
followed
disclosed
in
that
cavern
of
horrors
the
rocks
split
like
planks
of
deal
beneath
the
axe
a
jet
of
fire
smoke
and
debris
sprang
from
the
middle
of
the
grotto
enlarging

out
of
the

a
dozen
of

leaps
and
he
would
reach
the

suddenly
he
felt
his
knees
give

his

powerless
his

he
fell
upon

with
his

he
clung
to
the
rocks
and
raised
himself
up
again

repeated

bending

monseigneur
shouted
the
bretons
to
porthos
who
was
floundering
as
in
a
dream
but
there
was
no
time
the
explosion
thundered
earth
gaped
the
smoke
which
hurled
through
the
clefts
obscured
the
sky
the
sea
flowed
back
as
though
driven
by
the
blast
of
flame
which
darted
from
the
grotto
as
if
from
the
jaws
of
some
gigantic
fiery
chimera
the
reflux
took
the

out
twenty
toises
the

rocks
cracked
to
their

and
separated
like
blocks
beneath
the
operation
of
the
wedge
a
portion
of
the
vault
was
carried
up
towards

if
it

built

conflagration
and
black

oscillated

and
fell
successively
the
mighty
monoliths
of
rock
which
the
violence
of
the
explosion
had
not
been
able
to
uproot
from
the
bed
of
ages
they
bowed
to
each
other
like
grave
and
stiff
old
men
then
prostrating
themselves
lay
down
forever
in
their
dusty
tomb
this
frightful
shock
seemed
to
restore
porthos
the
strength
that
he
had
lost
he
arose
a
giant
among
granite
giants
but
at
the
moment
he
was
flying
between
the
double
hedge
of
granite
phantoms
these
latter
which
were
no
longer
supported
by
the
corresponding
links
began
to
roll
and
totter
round
our
titan
who
looked
as
if
precipitated
from
heaven
amidst
rocks
which
he
had
just
been
launching
porthos
felt
the
very
earth
beneath
his
feet
becoming
jellytremulous
he
stretched
both
hands
to
repulse
the
falling
rocks
a
gigantic
block
was
held
back
by
each
of
his
extended
arms
he
bent
his
head
and
a
third
granite
mass
sank
between
his
shoulders
for
an
instant
the
power
of
porthos
seemed
about
to
fail
him
but
this
new
hercules
united
all
his
force
and
the
two
walls
of
the
prison
in
which
he
was
buried
fell
back
slowly
and
gave
him
place
for
an
instant
he
appeared
in
this
frame
of
granite
like
the
angel
of
chaos
but
in
pushing
back
the
lateral
rocks
he
lost
his
point
of
support
for
the
monolith
which
weighed
upon
his
shoulders
and
the
boulder
pressing
upon
him
with
all
its
weight
brought
the
giant
down
upon
his
knees
the
lateral
rocks
for
an
instant
pushed
back
drew
together
again
and
added
their
weight
to
the
ponderous
mass
which
would
have
been
sufficient
to
crush
ten
men
the
hero
fell
without

while
answering
aramis
with
words
of
encouragement
and
hope
for
thanks
to
the
powerful
arch
of
his
hands
for
an
instant
he
believed
that
like
enceladus
he
would
succeed
in
shaking
off
the
triple
load
but
by
degrees
aramis
beheld
the
block
sink
the
hands
strung
for
an
instant
the
arms
stiffened
for
a
last
effort

sank

with
a
voice
growing

patience
scarcely
had
he
pronounced
these
words
when
the
impulse
of
the
fall
augmented
the
weight
the
enormous
rock
sank
down
pressed
by
those
others
which
sank
in
from
the
sides
and
as
it
were
swallowed
up
porthos
in
a
sepulcher
of
badly
jointed
stones
on
hearing
the
dying
voice
of
his
friend
aramis
had
sprung
to

of

bretons

him
with

animated
active
and
young
as
at
twenty
sprang
towards
the

with
his
hands
delicate
as
those
of
a
woman
raised
by
a
miracle
of
strength
the
cornerstone
of
this
great
granite
grave
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
darkness
of
that
charnelhouse
of
the
still
brilliant
eye
of
his
friend
to
whom
the
momentary
lifting
of
the
mass
restored
a
momentary
respiration
the
two
men
came
rushing
up
grasped
their
iron
levers
united
their
triple
strength
not
merely
to
raise
it
but
sustain
it
all
was
useless
they
gave
way
with
cries
of
grief
and
the
rough
voice
of
porthos
seeing
them
exhaust
themselves
in
a
useless
struggle
murmured
in
an
almost
cheerful
tone
those
supreme
words
which
came
to
his
lips
with
the
last
respiration
too
heavy
after
which
his
eyes
darkened
and
closed
his
face
grew
ashy
pale
the
hands
whitened
and
the
colossus
sank
quite
down
breathing
his
last
sigh
with
him
sank
the
rock
which
even
in
his
dying
agony
he
had
still
held
up
the
three
men
dropped
the
levers
which
rolled
upon
the
tumulary
stone
then
breathless
pale
his
brow
covered
with
sweat
aramis
listened
his
breast
oppressed
his
heart
ready
to
break
nothing

the
giant

eternal
sleep

its

swelling
with
the
kisses

the
breeze

carrying
them
rapidly
from

made

across
the

thus
during
which
daylight
gradually
disappeared
but
during
which
also
the
sail
in
view
gained
so
swiftly
on
the
bark
that
goenne
one
of
the
three
sailors
ventured
to
say
aloud
monseigneur
we
are
being
chased
aramis
made
no
reply
the
ship
still
gained
upon
them
then
of
their
own
accord
two
of
the
sailors
by
the
direction
of
the
patron
yves
lowered
the
sail
in
order
that
that
single
point
upon
the
surface
of
the
waters
should
cease
to
be
a
guide
to
the
eye
of
the
enemy
pursuing
them
on
the
part
of
the
ship
in
sight
on
the
contrary
two
more
small
sails
were
run
up
at
the
extremities
of
the
masts
unfortunately
it
was
the
time
of
the
finest
and
longest
days
of
the
year
and
the
moon
in
all
her
brilliancy
succeeded
inauspicious
daylight
the
balancelle
which
was
pursuing
the
little
bark
before
the
wind
had
then
still
half
an
hour
of
twilight
and
a
whole
night
almost
as
light
as
day
monseigneur
monseigneur
we
are
lost
said
the
captain
look
they
see
us
plainly
though
we
have
lowered
sail
that
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
murmured
one
of
the
sailors
since
they
say
that
by
the
aid
of
the
devil
the
parisfolk
have
fabricated
instruments
with
which
they
see
as
well
at
a
distance
as
near
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
aramis
took
a
telescope
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
focussed
it
silently
and
passing
it
to
the
sailor
here
said
he
look
the
sailor
hesitated
dont
be
alarmed
said
the
bishop
there
is
no
sin
in
it
and
if
there
is
any
sin
i
will
take
it
on
myself
the
sailor
lifted
the
glass
to
his
eye
and
uttered
a
cry
he
believed
that
the
vessel
which
appeared
to
be
distant
about
cannonshot
had
at
a
single
bound
cleared
the
whole
distance
but
on
withdrawing
the
instrument
from
his
eye
he
saw
that
except
the
way
which
the
balancelle
had
been
able
to
make
during
that
brief
instant
it
was
still
at
the
same
distance
so
murmured
the
sailor
they
can
see
us
as
we
see
them
they
see
us
said
aramis
and
sank
again
into
impassibility
whatthey
see
us
said
yves
impossible
well
captain
look
yourself
said
the
sailor
and
he
passed
him
the
glass
monseigneur
assures
me
that
the
devil
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
asked
yves
aramis
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
skipper
lifted
the
glass
to
his
eye
oh
monseigneur
said
he
it
is
a
miraclethere
they
are
it
seems
as
if
i
were
going
to
touch
them
twentyfive
men
at
least
ah
i
see
the
captain
forward
he
holds
a
glass
like
this
and
is
looking
at
us
ah
he
turns
round
and
gives
an
order
they
are
rolling
a
piece
of
cannon
forwardthey
are
loading
itpointing
it
misericorde
they
are
firing
at
us
and
by
a
mechanical
movement
the
skipper
put
aside
the
telescope
and
the
pursuing
ship
relegated
to
the
horizon
appeared
again
in
its
true
aspect
the
vessel
was
still
at
the
distance
of
nearly
a
league
but
the
maneuver
sighted
thus
was
not
less
real
a
light
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
beneath
the
sails
more
blue
than
they
and
spreading
like
a
flower
opening
then
at
about
a
mile
from
the
little
canoe
they
saw
the
ball
take
the
crown
off
two
or
three
waves
dig
a
white
furrow
in
the
sea
and
disappear
at
the
end
of
it
as
inoffensive
as
the
stone
with
which
in
play
a
boy
makes
ducks
and
drakes
it
was
at
once
a
menace
and
a
warning
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
patron
they
will
sink
us
said
goenne
give
us
absolution
monseigneur
and
the
sailors
fell
on
their
knees
before
him
you
forget
that
they
can
see
you
said
he
that
is
true
said
the
sailors
ashamed
of
their
weakness
give
us
your
orders
monseigneur
we
are
prepared
to
die
for
you
let
us
wait
said
aramis
howlet
us
wait
yes
do
you
not
see
as
you
just
now
said
that
if
we
endeavor
to
fly
they
will
sink
us
but
perhaps
the
patron
ventured
to
say
perhaps
under
cover
of
night
we
could
escape
them
oh
said
aramis
they
have
no
doubt
greek
fire
with
which
to
lighten
their
own
course
and
ours
likewise
at
the
same
moment
as
if
the
vessel
was
responsive
to
the
appeal
of
aramis
a
second
cloud
of
smoke
mounted
slowly
to
the
heavens
and
from
the
bosom
of
that
cloud
sparkled
an
arrow
of
flame
which
described
a
parabola
like
a
rainbow
and
fell
into
the
sea
where
it
continued
to
burn
illuminating
a
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
league
in
diameter
the
bretons
looked
at
each
other
in
terror
you
see
plainly
said
aramis
it
will
be
better
to
wait
for
them
the
oars
dropped
from
the
hands
of
the
sailors
and
the
bark
ceasing
to
make
way
rocked
motionless
upon
the
summits
of
the
waves
night
came
on
but
still
the
ship
drew
nearer
it
might
be
imagined
it
redoubled
its
speed
with
darkness
from
time
to
time
as
a
vulture
rears
its
head
out
of
its
nest
the
formidable
greek
fire
darted
from
its
sides
and
cast
its
flame
upon
the
ocean
like
an
incandescent
snowfall
at
last
it
came
within
musketshot
all
the
men
were
on
deck
arms
in
hand
the
cannoniers
were
at
their
guns
the
matches
burning
it
might
be
thought
they
were
about
to
board
a
frigate
and
to
fight
a
crew
superior
in
number
to
their
own
not
to
attempt
the
capture
of
a
canoe
manned
by
four
people
surrender
cried
the
commander
of
the
balancelle
with
the
aid
of
his
speakingtrumpet
the
sailors
looked
at
aramis
aramis
made
a
sign
with
his
head
yves
waved
a
white
cloth
at
the
end
of
a
gaff
this
was
like
striking
their
flag
the
pursuer
came
on
like
a
racehorse
it
launched
a
fresh
greek
fire
which
fell
within
twenty
paces
of
the
little
canoe
and
threw
a
light
upon
them
as
white
as
sunshine
at
the
first
sign
of
resistance
cried
the
commander
of
the
balancelle
fire
the
soldiers
brought
their
muskets
to
the
present
did
we
not
say
we
surrendered
said
yves
alive
alive
captain
cried
one
excited
soldier
they
must
be
taken
alive
well
yesliving
said
the
captain
then
turning
towards
the
bretons
your
lives
are
safe
my
friends
cried
he
all
but
the
chevalier
dherblay
aramis
stared
imperceptibly
for
an
instant
his
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
depths
of
the
ocean
illumined
by
the
last
flashes
of
the
greek
fire
which
ran
along
the
sides
of
the
waves
played
on
the
crests
like
plumes
and
rendered
still
darker
and
more
terrible
the
gulfs
they
covered
do
you
hear
monseigneur
said
the
sailors
yes
what
are
your
orders
accept
but
you
monseigneur
aramis
leaned
still
more
forward
and
dipped
the
ends
of
his
long
white
fingers
in
the
green
limpid
waters
of
the
sea
to
which
he
turned
with
smiles
as
to
a
friend
accept
repeated
he
we
accept
repeated
the
sailors
but
what
security
have
we
the
word
of
a
gentleman
said
the
officer
by
my
rank
and
by
my
name
i
swear
that
all
except
m
le
chevalier
dherblay
shall
have
their
lives
spared
i
am
lieutenant
of
the
kings
frigate
the
pomona
and
my
name
is
louis
constant
de
pressigny
with
a
rapid
gesture
aramisalready
bent
over
the
side
of
the
bark
towards
the
seadrew
himself
up
and
with
a
flashing
eye
and
a
smile
upon
his
lips
throw
out
the
ladder
messieurs
said
he
as
if
the
command
had
belonged
to
him
he
was
obeyed
when
aramis
seizing
the
rope
ladder
walked
straight
up
to
the
commander
with
a
firm
step
looked
at
him
earnestly
made
a
sign
to
him
with
his
hand
a
mysterious
and
unknown
sign
at
sight
of
which
the
officer
turned
pale
trembled
and
bowed
his
head
the
sailors
were
profoundly
astonished
without
a
word
aramis
then
raised
his
hand
to
the
eyes
of
the
commander
and
showed
him
the
collet
of
a
ring
he
wore
on
the
ringfinger
of
his
left
hand
and
while
making
this
sign
aramis
draped
in
cold
and
haughty
majesty
had
the
air
of
an
emperor
giving
his
hand
to
be
kissed
the
commandant
who
for
a
moment
had
raised
his
head
bowed
a
second
time
with
marks
of
the
most
profound
respect
then
stretching
his
hand
out
in
his
turn
towards
the
poop
that
is
to
say
towards
his
own
cabin
he
drew
back
to
allow
aramis
to
go
first
the
three
bretons
who
had
come
on
board
after
their
bishop
looked
at
each
other
stupefied
the
crew
were
awed
to
silence
five
minutes
after
the
commander
called
the
second
lieutenant
who
returned
immediately
ordering
the
head
to
be
put
towards
corunna
whilst
this
order
was
being
executed
aramis
reappeared
upon
the
deck
and
took
a
seat
near
the
bastingage
night
had
fallen
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
yet
aramis
looked
incessantly
towards
belleisle
yves
then
approached
the
captain
who
had
returned
to
take
his
post
in
the
stern
and
said
in
a
low
and
humble
voice
what
course
are
we
to
follow
captain
we
take
what
course
monseigneur
pleases
replied
the
officer
aramis
passed
the
night
leaning
upon
the
bastingage
yves
on
approaching
him
next
morning
remarked
that
the
night
must
have
been
a
very
damp
one
for
the
wood
on
which
the
bishops
head
had
rested
was
soaked
with
dew
who
knowsthat
dew
was
it
may
be
the
first
tears
that
had
ever
fallen
from
the
eyes
of
aramis
what
epitaph
would
have
been
worth
that
good
porthos
chapter
lii
m
de
gesvress
round
dartagnan
was
little
used
to
resistance
like
that
he
had
just
experienced
he
returned
profoundly
irritated
to
nantes
irritation
with
this
vigorous
man
usually
vented
itself
in
impetuous
attack
which
few
people
hitherto
were
they
king
were
they
giants
had
been
able
to
resist
trembling
with
rage
he
went
straight
to
the
castle
and
asked
an
audience
with
the
king
it
might
be
about
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
and
since
his
arrival
at
nantes
the
king
had
been
an
early
riser
but
on
arriving
at
the
corridor
with
which
we
are
acquainted
dartagnan
found
m
de
gesvres
who
stopped
him
politely
telling
him
not
to
speak
too
loud
and
disturb
the
king
is
the
king
asleep
said
dartagnan
well
i
will
let
him
sleep
but
about
what
oclock
do
you
suppose
he
will
rise
oh
in
about
two
hours
his
majesty
has
been
up
all
night
dartagnan
took
his
hat
again
bowed
to
m
de
gesvres
and
returned
to
his
own
apartments
he
came
back
at
halfpast
nine
and
was
told
that
the
king
was
at
breakfast
that
will
just
suit
me
said
dartagnan
i
will
talk
to
the
king
while
he
is
eating
m
de
brienne
reminded
dartagnan
that
the
king
would
not
see
any
one
at
mealtime
but
said
dartagnan
looking
askant
at
brienne
you
do
not
know
perhaps
monsieur
that
i
have
the
privilege
of
entree
anywhereand
at
any
hour
brienne
took
the
captains
hand
kindly
and
said
not
at
nantes
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
the
king
in
this
journey
has
changed
everything
dartagnan
a
little
softened
asked
about
what
oclock
the
king
would
have
finished
his
breakfast
we
dont
know
ehdont
know
what
does
that
mean
you
dont
know
how
much
time
the
king
devotes
to
eating
it
is
generally
an
hour
and
if
we
admit
that
the
air
of
the
loire
gives
an
additional
appetite
we
will
extend
it
to
an
hour
and
a
half
that
is
enough
i
think
i
will
wait
where
i
am
oh
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
the
order
of
the
day
is
not
to
allow
any
person
to
remain
in
this
corridor
i
am
on
guard
for
that
particular
purpose
dartagnan
felt
his
anger
mounting
to
his
brain
a
second
time
he
went
out
quickly
for
fear
of
complicating
the
affair
by
a
display
of
premature
illhumor
as
soon
as
he
was
out
he
began
to
reflect
the
king
said
he
will
not
receive
me
that
is
evident
the
young
man
is
angry
he
is
afraid
beforehand
of
the
words
that
i
may
speak
to
him
yes
but
in
the
meantime
belleisle
is
besieged
and
my
two
friends
by
now
probably
taken
or
killed
poor
porthos
as
to
master
aramis
he
is
always
full
of
resources
and
i
am
easy
on
his
account
but
no
no
porthos
is
not
yet
an
invalid
nor
is
aramis
in
his
dotage
the
one
with
his
arm
the
other
with
his
imagination
will
find
work
for
his
majestys
soldiers
who
knows
if
these
brave
men
may
not
get
up
for
the
edification
of
his
most
christian
majesty
a
little
bastion
of
saintgervais
i
dont
despair
of
it
they
have
cannon
and
a
garrison
and
yet
continued
dartagnan
i
dont
know
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
stop
the
combat
for
myself
alone
i
will
not
put
up
with
either
surly
looks
or
insults
from
the
king
but
for
my
friends
i
must
put
up
with
everything
shall
i
go
to
m
colbert
now
there
is
a
man
i
must
acquire
the
habit
of
terrifying
i
will
go
to
m
colbert
and
dartagnan
set
forward
bravely
to
find
m
colbert
but
was
informed
that
he
was
working
with
the
king
at
the
castle
of
nantes
good
cried
he
the
times
have
come
again
in
which
i
measured
my
steps
from
de
treville
to
the
cardinal
from
the
cardinal
to
the
queen
from
the
queen
to
louis
xiii
truly
is
it
said
that
men
in
growing
old
become
children
againto
the
castle
then
he
returned
thither
m
de
lyonne
was
coming
out
he
gave
dartagnan
both
hands
but
told
him
that
the
king
had
been
busy
all
the
preceding
evening
and
all
night
and
that
orders
had
been
given
that
no
one
should
be
admitted
not
even
the
captain
who
takes
the
order
cried
dartagnan
i
think
that
is
rather
too
strong
not
even
he
said
m
de
lyonne
since
that
is
the
case
replied
dartagnan
wounded
to
the
heart
since
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
who
has
always
entered
the
kings
chamber
is
no
longer
allowed
to
enter
it
his
cabinet
or
his
salleamanger
either
the
king
is
dead
or
his
captain
is
in
disgrace
do
me
the
favor
then
m
de
lyonne
who
are
in
favor
to
return
and
tell
the
king
plainly
i
send
him
my
resignation
dartagnan
beware
of
what
you
are
doing
for
friendships
sake
go
and
he
pushed
him
gently
towards
the
cabinet
well
i
will
go
said
lyonne
dartagnan
waited
walking
about
the
corridor
in
no
enviable
mood
lyonne
returned
well
what
did
the
king
say
exclaimed
dartagnan
he
simply
answered
tis
well
replied
lyonne
that
it
was
well
said
the
captain
with
an
explosion
that
is
to
say
that
he
accepts
it
good
now
then
i
am
free
i
am
only
a
plain
citizen
m
de
lyonne
i
have
the
pleasure
of
bidding
you
goodbye
farewell
castle
corridor
antechamber
a
bourgeois
about
to
breathe
at
liberty
takes
his
farewell
of
you
and
without
waiting
longer
the
captain
sprang
from
the
terrace
down
the
staircase
where
he
had
picked
up
the
fragments
of
gourvilles
letter
five
minutes
after
he
was
at
the
hostelry
where
according
to
the
custom
of
all
great
officers
who
have
lodgings
at
the
castle
he
had
taken
what
was
called
his
citychamber
but
when
he
arrived
there
instead
of
throwing
off
his
sword
and
cloak
he
took
his
pistols
put
his
money
into
a
large
leather
purse
sent
for
his
horses
from
the
castlestables
and
gave
orders
that
would
ensure
their
reaching
vannes
during
the
night
everything
went
on
according
to
his
wishes
at
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
he
was
putting
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
when
m
de
gesvres
appeared
at
the
head
of
twelve
guards
in
front
of
the
hostelry
dartagnan
saw
all
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
could
not
fail
seeing
thirteen
men
and
thirteen
horses
but
he
feigned
not
to
observe
anything
and
was
about
to
put
his
horse
in
motion
gesvres
rode
up
to
him
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
aloud
ah
monsieur
de
gesvres
good
evening
one
would
say
you
were
getting
on
horseback
more
than

see
it
is
fortunate
i
have
met
with
you

looking
for
me
then
mon
dieu
yes
on
the
part
of
the
king
i
will
wager
yes
as
i
three
days
ago
went
in
search
of
m
fouquet
oh
nonsense
it
is
of
no
use
being
overdelicate
with
me
that
is
all
labor
lost
tell
me
at
once
you
are
come
to
arrest

arrest
yougood
heavens
no
why
do
you
come
to
accost
me
with
twelve
horsemen
at
your
heels
then
i
am
making
my
round
that
isnt
bad
and
so

your
round

with
you
and
i
beg
you
to
come
with
me
where
to
the
king
good
said
dartagnan
with
a
bantering
air
the
king
is
disengaged
for
heavens
sake
captain
said
m
de
gesvres
in
a
low
voice
to
the
musketeer
do
not
compromise
yourself
these
men
hear
you
dartagnan
laughed
aloud
and
replied
march
people
who
are
arrested
are
placed
between
the
six
first
guards
and
the
six
last
but
as
i
am
not
arresting
you
said
m
de
gesvres
you
will
march
behind
with
me
if
you
please
well
said
dartagnan
that
is
very
polite
duke
and
you
are
right
in
being
so
for
if
ever
i
had
had
to
make
my
rounds
near
your
chambredeville
i
should
have
been
courteous
to
you
i
assure
you
on
the
word
of
a
gentleman
now
one
favor
more
what
does
the
king
want
with
me
oh
the
king
is
furious
very
well
the
king
who
has
thought
it
worth
while
to
be
angry
may
take
the
trouble
to
grow
calm
again
that
is
all
i
shant
die
of
that
i
will
swear
no
but
buti
shall
be
sent
to
keep
company
with
unfortunate
m
fouquet
mordioux
that
is
a
gallant
man
a
worthy
man
we
shall
live
very
sociably
together
i
will
be
sworn
here
we
are
at
our
place
of
destination
said
the
duke
captain
for
heavens
sake
be
calm
with
the
king
ah
ah
you
are
playing
the
brave
man
with
me
duke
said
dartagnan
throwing
one
of
his
defiant
glances
over
gesvres
i
have
been
told
that
you
are
ambitious
of
uniting
your
guards
with
my
musketeers
this
strikes
me
as
a
splendid
opportunity
i
will
take
exceeding
good
care
not
to
avail
myself
of
it
captain
and
why
not
pray
oh
for
many
reasonsin
the
first
place
for
this
if
i
were
to
succeed
you
in
the
musketeers
after
having
arrested
you
ah
then
you
admit
you
have
arrested
me
no
i
dont
say
met
me
then
so
you
were
saying
if
you
were
to
succeed
me
after
having
arrested
me
your
musketeers
at
the
first
exercise
with
ball
cartridges
would
fire
my
way
by
mistake
oh
as
to
that
i
wont
say
for
the
fellows
do
love
me
a
little
gesvres
made
dartagnan
pass
in
first
and
took
him
straight
to
the
cabinet
where
louis
was
waiting
for
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
and
placed
himself
behind
his
colleague
in
the
antechamber
the
king
could
be
heard
distinctly
speaking
aloud
to
colbert
in
the
same
cabinet
where
colbert
might
have
heard
a
few
days
before
the
king
speaking
aloud
with
m
dartagnan
the
guards
remained
as
a
mounted
picket
before
the
principal
gate
and
the
report
was
quickly
spread
throughout
the
city
that
monsieur
le
capitaine
of
the
musketeers
had
been
arrested
by
order
of
the
king
then
these
men
were
seen
to
be
in
motion
and
as
in
the
good
old
times
of
louis
xiii
and
m
de
treville
groups
were
formed
and
staircases
were
filled
vague
murmurs
issuing
from
the
court
below
came
rolling
to
the
upper
stories
like
the
distant
moaning
of
the
waves
m
de
gesvres
became
uneasy
he
looked
at
his
guards
who
after
being
interrogated
by
the
musketeers
who
had
just
got
among
their
ranks
began
to
shun
them
with
a
manifestation
of
innocence
dartagnan
was
certainly
less
disturbed
by
all
this
than
m
de
gesvres
the
captain
of
the
guards
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
seated
himself
on
the
ledge
of
a
window
whence
with
his
eagle
glance
he
saw
all
that
was
going
on
without
the
least
emotion
no
step
of
the
progressive
fermentation
which
had
shown
itself
at
the
report
of
his
arrest
escaped
him
he
foresaw
the
very
moment
the
explosion
would
take
place
and
we
know
that
his
previsions
were
in
general
correct
it
would
be
very
whimsical
thought
he
if
this
evening
my
praetorians
should
make
me
king
of
france
how
i
should
laugh
but
at
the
height
all
was
stopped
guards
musketeers
officers
soldiers
murmurs
uneasiness
dispersed
vanished
died
away
there
was
an
end
of
menace
and
sedition
one
word
had
calmed
the
waves
the
king
had
desired
brienne
to
say
hush
messieurs
you
disturb
the
king
dartagnan
sighed
all
is
over
said
he
the
musketeers
of
the
present
day
are
not
those
of
his
majesty
louis
xiii
all
is
over
monsieur
dartagnan
you
are
wanted
in
the
antechamber
of
the
king
proclaimed
an
usher
chapter
liii
king
louis
xiv
the
king
was
seated
in
his
cabinet
with
his
back
turned
towards
the
door
of
entrance
in
front
of
him
was
a
mirror
in
which
while
turning
over
his
papers
he
could
see
at
a
glance
those
who
came
in
he
did
not
take
any
notice
of
the
entrance
of
dartagnan
but
spread
above
his
letters
and
plans
the
large
silk
cloth
he
used
to
conceal
his
secrets
from
the
importunate
dartagnan
understood
this
byplay
and
kept
in
the
background
so
that
at
the
end
of
a
minute
the
king
who
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
save
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
was
obliged
to
cry
is
not
m
dartagnan
there
i
am
here
sire
replied
the
musketeer
advancing
well
monsieur
said
the
king
fixing
his
pellucid
eyes
on
dartagnan
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
i
sire
replied
the
latter
who
watched
the
first
blow
of
his
adversary
to
make
a
good
retort
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
your
majesty
unless
it
be
that
you
have
caused
me
to
be
arrested
and
here
i
am
the
king
was
going
to
reply
that
he
had
not
had
dartagnan
arrested
but
any
such
sentence
appeared
too
much
like
an
excuse
and
he
was
silent
dartagnan
likewise
preserved
an
obstinate
silence
monsieur
at
length
resumed
the
king
what
did
i
charge
you
to
go
and
do
at
belleisle
tell
me
if
you
please
the
king
while
uttering
these
words
looked
intently
at
his
captain
here
dartagnan
was
fortunate
the
king
seemed
to
place
the
game
in
his
hands
i
believe
replied
he
that
your
majesty
does
me
the
honor
to
ask
what
i
went
to
belleisle
to
accomplish
yes
monsieur
well
sire
i
know
nothing
about
it
it
is
not
of
me
that
question
should
be
asked
but
of
that
infinite
number
of
officers
of
all
kinds
to
whom
have
been
given
innumerable
orders
of
all
kinds
whilst
to
me
head
of
the
expedition
nothing
precise
was
said
or
stated
in
any
form
whatever
the
king
was
hurt
he
showed
it
by
his
reply
monsieur
said
he
orders
have
only
been
given
to
such
as
were
judged
faithful
and
therefore
i
have
been
astonished
sire
retorted
the
musketeer
that
a
captain
like
myself
who
ranks
with
a
marechal
of
france
should
have
found
himself
under
the
orders
of
five
or
six
lieutenants
or
majors
good
to
make
spies
of
possibly
but
not
at
all
fit
to
conduct
a
warlike
expedition
it
was
upon
this
subject
i
came
to
demand
an
explanation
of
your
majesty
when
i
found
the
door
closed
against
me
which
the
final
insult
offered
to
a
brave
man
has
led
me
to
quit
your
majestys
service
monsieur
replied
the
king
you
still
believe
that
you
are
living
in
an
age
when
kings
were
as
you
complain
of
having
been
under
the
orders
and
at
the
discretion
of
their
inferiors
you
seem
to
forget
that
a
king
owes
an
account
of
his
actions
to
none
but
god
i
forget
nothing
sire
said
the
musketeer
wounded
by
this
lesson
besides
i
do
not
see
in
what
an
honest
man
when
he
asks
of
his
king
how
he
has
illserved
him
offends
him
you
have
illserved
me
monsieur
by
siding
with
my
enemies
against
me
who
are
your
enemies
sire
the
men
i
sent
you
to
fight
two
men
the
enemies
of
the
whole
of
your
majestys
army
that
is
incredible
you
have
no
power
to
judge
of
my
will
but
i
have
to
judge
of
my
own
friendships
sire
he
who
serves
his
friends
does
not
serve
his
master
i
so
well
understand
this
sire
that
i
have
respectfully
offered
your
majesty
my
resignation
and
i
have
accepted
it
monsieur
said
the
king
before
being
separated
from
you
i
was
willing
to
prove
to
you
that
i
know
how
to
keep
my
word
your
majesty
has
kept
more
than
your
word
for
your
majesty
has
had
me
arrested
said
dartagnan
with
his
cold
bantering
air
you
did
not
promise
me
that
sire
the
king
would
not
condescend
to
perceive
the
pleasantry
and
continued
seriously
you
see
monsieur
to
what
grave
steps
your
disobedience
forces
me
my
disobedience
cried
dartagnan
red
with
anger
it
is
the
mildest
term
that
i
can
find
pursued
the
king
my
idea
was
to
take
and
punish
rebels
was
i
bound
to
inquire
whether
these
rebels
were
your
friends
or
not
but
i
was
replied
dartagnan
it
was
a
cruelty
on
your
majestys
part
to
send
me
to
capture
my
friends
and
lead
them
to
your
gibbets
it
was
a
trial
i
had
to
make
monsieur
of
pretended
servants
who
eat
my
bread
and
should
defend
my
person
the
trial
has
succeeded
ill
monsieur
dartagnan
for
one
bad
servant
your
majesty
loses
said
the
musketeer
with
bitterness
there
are
ten
who
on
that
same
day
go
through
a
like
ordeal
listen
to
me
sire
i
am
not
accustomed
to
that
service
mine
is
a
rebel
sword
when
i
am
required
to
do
ill
it
was
ill
to
send
me
in
pursuit
of
two
men
whose
lives
m
fouquet
your
majestys
preserver
implored
you
to
save
still
further
these
men
were
my
friends
they
did
not
attack
your
majesty
they
succumbed
to
your
blind
anger
besides
why
were
they
not
allowed
to
escape
what
crime
had
they
committed
i
admit
you
may
contest
with
me
the
right
of
judging
their
conduct
but
why
suspect
me
before
the
action
why
surround
me
with
spies
why
disgrace
me
before
the
army
why
me
in
whom
till
now
you
showed
the
most
entire
confidencewho
for
thirty
years
have
been
attached
to
your
person
and
have
given
you
a
thousand
proofs
of
my
devotionfor
it
must
be
said
now
that
i
am
accusedwhy
reduce
me
to
see
three
thousand
of
the
kings
soldiers
march
in
battle
against
two
men
one
would
say
you
have
forgotten
what
these
men
have
done
to
me
said
the
king
in
a
hollow
voice
and
that
it
was
no
merit
of
theirs
i
was
not
lost
sire
one
would
imagine
you
forget
that
i
was
there
enough
monsieur
dartagnan
enough
of
these
dominating
interests
which
arise
to
keep
the
sun
itself
from
my
interests
i
am
founding
a
state
in
which
there
shall
be
but
one
master
as
i
promised
you
the
moment
is
at
hand
for
me
to
keep
my
promise
you
wish
to
be
according
to
your
tastes
or
private
friendships
free
to
destroy
my
plans
and
save
my
enemies
i
will
thwart
you
or
will
drop
youseek
a
more
compliant
master
i
know
full
well
that
another
king
would
not
conduct
himself
as
i
do
and
would
allow
himself
to
be
dominated
by
you
at
the
risk
of
sending
you
some
day
to
keep
company
with
m
fouquet
and
the
rest
but
i
have
an
excellent
memory
and
for
me
services
are
sacred
titles
to
gratitude
to
impunity
you
shall
only
have
this
lesson
monsieur
dartagnan
as
the
punishment
of
your
want
of
discipline
and
i
will
not
imitate
my
predecessors
in
anger
not
having
imitated
them
in
favor
and
then
other
reasons
make
me
act
mildly
towards
you
in
the
first
place
because
you
are
a
man
of
sense
a
man
of
excellent
sense
a
man
of
heart
and
that
you
will
be
a
capital
servant
to
him
who
shall
have
mastered
you
secondly
because
you
will
cease
to
have
any
motives
for
insubordination
your
friends
are
now
destroyed
or
ruined
by
me
these
supports
on
which
your
capricious
mind
instinctively
relied
i
have
caused
to
disappear
at
this
moment
my
soldiers
have
taken
or
killed
the
rebels
of
belleisle
dartagnan
became
pale
taken
or
killed
cried
he
oh
sire
if
you
thought
what
you
tell
if
you
were
sure
you
were
telling
me
the
truth
i
should
forget
all
that
is
just
all
that
is
magnanimous
in
your
words
to
call
you
a
barbarous
king
and
an
unnatural
man
but
i
pardon
you
these
words
said
he
smiling
with
pride
i
pardon
them
to
a
young
prince
who
does
not
know
who
cannot
comprehend
what
such
men
as
m
dherblay
m
du
vallon
and
myself
are
taken
or
killed
ah
ah
sire
tell
me
if
the
news
is
true
how
much
has
it
cost
you
in
men
and
money
we
will
then
reckon
if
the
game
has
been
worth
the
stakes
as
he
spoke
thus
the
king
went
up
to
him
in
great
anger
and
said
monsieur
dartagnan
your
replies
are
those
of
a
rebel
tell
me
if
you
please
who
is
king
of
france
do
you
know
any
other
sire
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
coldly
i
very
well
remember
that
one
morning
at
vaux
you
addressed
that
question
to
many
people
who
did
not
answer
to
it
whilst
i
on
my
part
did
answer
to
it
if
i
recognized
my
king
on
that
day
when
the
thing
was
not
easy
i
think
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
the
question
of
me
now
when
your
majesty
and
i
are
alone
at
these
words
louis
cast
down
his
eyes
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
shade
of
the
unfortunate
philippe
passed
between
dartagnan
and
himself
to
evoke
the
remembrance
of
that
terrible
adventure
almost
at
the
same
moment
an
officer
entered
and
placed
a
dispatch
in
the
hands
of
the
king
who
in
his
turn
changed
color
while
reading
it
monsieur
said
he
what
i
learn
here
you
would
know
later
it
is
better
i
should
tell
you
and
that
you
should
learn
it
from
the
mouth
of
your
king
a
battle
has
taken
place
at
belleisle
is
it
possible
said
dartagnan
with
a
calm
air
though
his
heart
was
beating
fast
enough
to
choke
him
well
sire
well
monsieurand
i
have
lost
a
hundred
and
ten
men
a
beam
of
joy
and
pride
shone
in
the
eyes
of
dartagnan
and
the
rebels
said
he
the
rebels
have
fled
said
the
king
dartagnan
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
triumph
only
added
the
king
i
have
a
fleet
which
closely
blockades
belleisle
and
i
am
certain
not
a
bark
can
escape
so
that
said
the
musketeer
brought
back
to
his
dismal
idea
if
these
two
gentlemen
are
taken
they
will
be
hanged
said
the
king
quietly
and
do
they
know
it
replied
dartagnan
repressing
his
trembling
they
know
it
because
you
must
have
told
them
yourself
and
all
the
country
knows
it
then
sire
they
will
never
be
taken
alive
i
will
answer
for
that
ah
said
the
king
negligently
and
taking
up
his
letter
again
very
well
they
will
be
dead
then
monsieur
dartagnan
and
that
will
come
to
the
same
thing
since
i
should
only
take
them
to
have
them
hanged
dartagnan
wiped
the
sweat
which
flowed
from
his
brow
i
have
told
you
pursued
louis
xiv
that
i
would
one
day
be
an
affectionate
generous
and
constant
master
you
are
now
the
only
man
of
former
times
worthy
of
my
anger
or
my
friendship
i
will
not
spare
you
either
sentiment
according
to
your
conduct
could
you
serve
a
king
monsieur
dartagnan
who
should
have
a
hundred
kings
his
equals
in
the
kingdom
could
i
tell
me
do
with
such
weak
instruments
the
great
things
i
meditate
did
you
ever
see
an
artist
effect
great
works
with
an
unworthy
tool
far
from
us
monsieur
the
old
leaven
of
feudal
abuse
the
fronde
which
threatened
to
ruin
monarchy
has
emancipated
it
i
am
master
at
home
captain
dartagnan
and
i
shall
have
servants
who
lacking
perhaps
your
genius
will
carry
devotion
and
obedience
to
the
verge
of
heroism
of
what
consequence
i
ask
you
of
what
consequence
is
it
that
god
has
given
no
sense
to
arms
and
legs
it
is
to
the
head
he
has
given
genius
and
the
head
you
know
the
rest
obey
i
am
the
head
dartagnan
started
louis
xiv
continued
as
if
he
had
seen
nothing
although
this
emotion
had
not
by
any
means
escaped
him
now
let
us
conclude
between
us
two
the
bargain
i
promised
to
make
with
you
one
day
when
you
found
me
in
a
very
strange
predicament
at
blois
do
me
justice
monsieur
when
you
admit
i
do
not
make
any
one
pay
for
the
tears
of
shame
that
i
then
shed
look
around
you
lofty
heads
have
bowed
bow
yours
or
choose
such
exile
as
will
suit
you
perhaps
when
reflecting
upon
it
you
will
find
your
king
has
a
generous
heart
who
reckons
sufficiently
upon
your
loyalty
to
allow
you
to
leave
him
dissatisfied
when
you
possess
a
great
state
secret
you
are
a
brave
man
i
know
you
to
be
so
why
have
you
judged
me
prematurely
judge
me
from
this
day
forward
dartagnan
and
be
as
severe
as
you
please
dartagnan
remained
bewildered
mute
undecided
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
at
last
he
had
found
an
adversary
worthy
of
him
this
was
no
longer
trick
it
was
calculation
no
longer
violence
but
strength
no
longer
passion
but
will
no
longer
boasting
but
council
this
young
man
who
had
brought
down
a
fouquet
and
could
do
without
a
dartagnan
deranged
the
somewhat
headstrong
calculations
of
the
musketeer
come
let
us
see
what
stops
you
said
the
king
kindly
you
have
given
in
your
resignation
shall
i
refuse
to
accept
it
i
admit
that
it
may
be
hard
for
such
an
old
captain
to
recover
lost
goodhumor
oh
replied
dartagnan
in
a
melancholy
tone
that
is
not
my
most
serious
care
i
hesitate
to
take
back
my
resignation
because
i
am
old
in
comparison
with
you
and
have
habits
difficult
to
abandon
henceforward
you
must
have
courtiers
who
know
how
to
amuse
youmadmen
who
will
get
themselves
killed
to
carry
out
what
you
call
your
great
works
great
they
will
be
i
feelbut
if
by
chance
i
should
not
think
them
so
i
have
seen
war
sire
i
have
seen
peace
i
have
served
richelieu
and
mazarin
i
have
been
scorched
with
your
father
at
the
fire
of
rochelle
riddled
with
swordthrusts
like
a
sieve
having
grown
a
new
skin
ten
times
as
serpents
do
after
affronts
and
injustices
i
have
a
command
which
was
formerly
something
because
it
gave
the
bearer
the
right
of
speaking
as
he
liked
to
his
king
but
your
captain
of
the
musketeers
will
henceforward
be
an
officer
guarding
the
outer
doors
truly
sire
if
that
is
to
be
my
employment
from
this
time
seize
the
opportunity
of
our
being
on
good
terms
to
take
it
from
me
do
not
imagine
that
i
bear
malice
no
you
have
tamed
me
as
you
say
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
taming
me
you
have
lowered
me
by
bowing
me
you
have
convicted
me
of
weakness
if
you
knew
how
well
it
suits
me
to
carry
my
head
high
and
what
a
pitiful
mien
i
shall
have
while
scenting
the
dust
of
your
carpets
oh
sire
i
regret
sincerely
and
you
will
regret
as
i
do
the
old
days
when
the
king
of
france
saw
in
every
vestibule
those
insolent
gentlemen
lean
always
swearingcrossgrained
mastiffs
who
could
bite
mortally
in
the
hour
of
danger
or
of
battle
these
men
were
the
best
of
courtiers
to
the
hand
which
fed
themthey
would
lick
it
but
for
the
hand
that
struck
them
oh
the
bite
that
followed
a
little
gold
on
the
lace
of
their
cloaks
a
slender
stomach
in
their
hautsdechausses
a
little
sparkling
of
gray
in
their
dry
hair
and
you
will
behold
the
handsome
dukes
and
peers
the
haughty
marechaux
of
france
but
why
should
i
tell
you
all
this
the
king
is
master
he
wills
that
i
should
make
verses
he
wills
that
i
should
polish
the
mosaics
of
his
antechambers
with
satin
shoes
mordioux
that
is
difficult
but
i
have
got
over
greater
difficulties
i
will
do
it
why
should
i
do
it
because
i
love
moneyi
have
enough
because
i
am
ambitiousmy
career
is
almost
at
an
end
because
i
love
the
court
no
i
will
remain
here
because
i
have
been
accustomed
for
thirty
years
to
go
and
take
the
orderly
word
of
the
king
and
to
have
said
to
me
good
evening
dartagnan
with
a
smile
i
did
not
beg
for
that
smile
i
will
beg
for
are
you
content
sire
and
dartagnan
bowed
his
silver
head
upon
which
the
smiling
king
placed
his
white
hand
with
pride
thanks
my
old
servant
my
faithful
friend
said
he
as
reckoning
from
this
day
i
have
no
longer
any
enemies
in
france
it
remains
with
me
to
send
you
to
a
foreign
field
to
gather
your
marshals
baton
depend
upon
me
for
finding
you
an
opportunity
in
the
meanwhile
eat
of
my
very
best
bread
and
sleep
in
absolute
tranquillity
that
is
all
kind
and
well
said
dartagnan
much
agitated
but
those
poor
men
at
belleisle
one
of
them
in
particularso
good
so
brave
so
true
do
you
ask
their
pardon
of
me
upon
my
knees
sire
well
then
go
and
take
it
to
them
if
it
be
still
in
time
but
do
you
answer
for
them
with
my
life
sire
go
then
tomorrow
i
set
out
for
paris
return
by
that
time
for
i
do
not
wish
you
to
leave
me
in
the
future
be
assured
of
that
sire
said
dartagnan
kissing
the
royal
hand
and
with
a
heart
swelling
with
joy
he
rushed
out
of
the
castle
on
his
way
to
belleisle
chapter
liv
m
fouquets
friends
the
king
had
returned
to
paris
and
with
him
dartagnan
who
in
twentyfour
hours
having
made
with
greatest
care
all
possible
inquiries
at
belleisle
succeeded
in
learning
nothing
of
the
secret
so
well
kept
by
the
heavy
rock
of
locmaria
which
had
fallen
on
the
heroic
porthos
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
only
knew
what
those
two
valiant
menthese
two
friends
whose
defense
he
had
so
nobly
taken
up
whose
lives
he
had
so
earnestly
endeavored
to
saveaided
by
three
faithful
bretons
had
accomplished
against
a
whole
army
he
had
seen
spread
on
the
neighboring
heath
the
human
remains
which
had
stained
with
clouted
blood
the
scattered
stones
among
the
flowering
broom
he
learned
also
that
a
bark
had
been
seen
far
out
at
sea
and
that
like
a
bird
of
prey
a
royal
vessel
had
pursued
overtaken
and
devoured
the
poor
little
bird
that
was
flying
with
such
palpitating
wings
but
there
dartagnans
certainties
ended
the
field
of
supposition
was
thrown
open
now
what
could
he
conjecture
the
vessel
had
not
returned
it
is
true
that
a
brisk
wind
had
prevailed
for
three
days
but
the
corvette
was
known
to
be
a
good
sailer
and
solid
in
its
timbers
it
had
no
need
to
fear
a
gale
of
wind
and
it
ought
according
to
the
calculation
of
dartagnan
to
have
either
returned
to
brest
or
come
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
loire
such
was
the
news
ambiguous
it
is
true
but
in
some
degree
reassuring
to
him
personally
which
dartagnan
brought
to
louis
xiv
when
the
king
followed
by
all
the
court
returned
to
paris
louis
satisfied
with
his
successlouis
more
mild
and
affable
as
he
felt
himself
more
powerfulhad
not
ceased
for
an
instant
to
ride
beside
the
carriage
door
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
everybody
was
anxious
to
amuse
the
two
queens
so
as
to
make
them
forget
this
abandonment
by
son
and
husband
everything
breathed
the
future
the
past
was
nothing
to
anybody
only
that
past
was
like
a
painful
bleeding
wound
to
the
hearts
of
certain
tender
and
devoted
spirits
scarcely
was
the
king
reinstalled
in
paris
when
he
received
a
touching
proof
of
this
louis
xiv
had
just
risen
and
taken
his
first
repast
when
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
presented
himself
before
him
dartagnan
was
pale
and
looked
unhappy
the
king
at
the
first
glance
perceived
the
change
in
a
countenance
generally
so
unconcerned
what
is
the
matter
dartagnan
said
he
sire
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
to
me
good
heavens
what
is
that
sire
i
have
lost
one
of
my
friends
m
du
vallon
in
the
affair
of
belleisle
and
while
speaking
these
words
dartagnan
fixed
his
falcon
eye
upon
louis
xiv
to
catch
the
first
feeling
that
would
show
itself
i
knew
it
replied
the
king
quietly
you
knew
it
and
did
not
tell
me
cried
the
musketeer
to
what
good
your
grief
my
friend
was
so
well
worthy
of
respect
it
was
my
duty
to
treat
it
gently
to
have
informed
you
of
this
misfortune
which
i
knew
would
pain
you
so
greatly
dartagnan
would
have
been
in
your
eyes
to
have
triumphed
over
you
yes
i
knew
that
m
du
vallon
had
buried
himself
beneath
the
rocks
of
locmaria
i
knew
that
m
dherblay
had
taken
one
of
my
vessels
with
its
crew
and
had
compelled
it
to
convey
him
to
bayonne
but
i
was
willing
you
should
learn
these
matters
in
a
direct
manner
in
order
that
you
might
be
convinced
my
friends
are
with
me
respected
and
sacred
that
always
in
me
the
man
will
sacrifice
himself
to
subjects
whilst
the
king
is
so
often
found
to
sacrifice
men
to
majesty
and
power
but
sire
how
could
you
know
how
do
you
yourself
know
dartagnan
by
this
letter
sire
which
m
dherblay
free
and
out
of
danger
writes
me
from
bayonne
look
here
said
the
king
drawing
from
a
casket
placed
upon
the
table
closet
to
the
seat
upon
which
dartagnan
was
leaning
here
is
a
letter
copied
exactly
from
that
of
m
dherblay
here
is
the
very
letter
which
colbert
placed
in
my
hands
a
week
before
you
received
yours
i
am
well
served
you
may
perceive
yes
sire
murmured
the
musketeer
you
were
the
only
man
whose
star
was
equal
to
the
task
of
dominating
the
fortune
and
strength
of
my
two
friends
you
have
used
your
power
sire
you
will
not
abuse
it
will
you
dartagnan
said
the
king
with
a
smile
beaming
with
kindness
i
could
have
m
dherblay
carried
off
from
the
territories
of
the
king
of
spain
and
brought
here
alive
to
inflict
justice
upon
him
but
dartagnan
be
assured
i
will
not
yield
to
this
first
and
natural
impulse
he
is
freelet
him
continue
free
oh
sire
you
will
not
always
remain
so
clement
so
noble
so
generous
as
you
have
shown
yourself
with
respect
to
me
and
m
dherblay
you
will
have
about
you
counselors
who
will
cure
you
of
that
weakness
no
dartagnan
you
are
mistaken
when
you
accuse
my
council
of
urging
me
to
pursue
rigorous
measures
the
advice
to
spare
m
dherblay
comes
from
colbert
himself
oh
sire
said
dartagnan
extremely
surprised
as
for
you
continued
the
king
with
a
kindness
very
uncommon
to
him
i
have
several
pieces
of
good
news
to
announce
to
you
but
you
shall
know
them
my
dear
captain
the
moment
i
have
made
my
accounts
all
straight
i
have
said
that
i
wish
to
make
and
would
make
your
fortune
that
promise
will
soon
become
reality
a
thousand
times
thanks
sire
i
can
wait
but
i
implore
you
whilst
i
go
and
practice
patience
that
your
majesty
will
deign
to
notice
those
poor
people
who
have
for
so
long
a
time
besieged
your
antechamber
and
come
humbly
to
lay
a
petition
at
your
feet
who
are
they
enemies
of
your
majesty
the
king
raised
his
head
friends
of
m
fouquet
added
dartagnan
their
names
m
gourville
m
pelisson
and
a
poet
m
jean
de
la
fontaine
the
king
took
a
moment
to
reflect
what
do
they
want
i
do
not
know
how
do
they
appear
in
great
affliction
what
do
they
say
nothing
what
do
they
do
they
weep
let
them
come
in
said
the
king
with
a
serious
brow
dartagnan
turned
rapidly
on
his
heel
raised
the
tapestry
which
closed
the
entrance
to
the
royal
chamber
and
directing
his
voice
to
the
adjoining
room
cried
enter
the
three
men
dartagnan
had
named
immediately
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
in
which
were
the
king
and
his
captain
a
profound
silence
prevailed
in
their
passage
the
courtiers
at
the
approach
of
the
friends
of
the
unfortunate
superintendent
of
finances
drew
back
as
if
fearful
of
being
affected
by
contagion
with
disgrace
and
misfortune
dartagnan
with
a
quick
step
came
forward
to
take
by
the
hand
the
unhappy
men
who
stood
trembling
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
he
led
them
in
front
of
the
kings
fauteuil
who
having
placed
himself
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
awaited
the
moment
of
presentation
and
was
preparing
himself
to
give
the
supplicants
a
rigorously
diplomatic
reception
the
first
of
the
friends
of
fouquets
to
advance
was
pelisson
he
did
not
weep
but
his
tears
were
only
restrained
that
the
king
might
better
hear
his
voice
and
prayer
gourville
bit
his
lips
to
check
his
tears
out
of
respect
for
the
king
la
fontaine
buried
his
face
in
his
handkerchief
and
the
only
signs
of
life
he
gave
were
the
convulsive
motions
of
his
shoulders
raised
by
his
sobs
the
king
preserved
his
dignity
his
countenance
was
impassible
he
even
maintained
the
frown
which
appeared
when
dartagnan
announced
his
enemies
he
made
a
gesture
which
signified
speak
and
he
remained
standing
with
his
eyes
fixed
searchingly
on
these
desponding
men
pelisson
bowed
to
the
ground
and
la
fontaine
knelt
as
people
do
in
churches
this
dismal
silence
disturbed
only
by
sighs
and
groans
began
to
excite
in
the
king
not
compassion
but
impatience
monsieur
pelisson
said
he
in
a
sharp
dry
tone
monsieur
gourville
and
you
monsieur
and
he
did
not
name
la
fontaine
i
cannot
without
sensible
displeasure
see
you
come
to
plead
for
one
of
the
greatest
criminals
it
is
the
duty
of
justice
to
punish
a
king
does
not
allow
himself
to
soften
save
at
the
tears
of
the
innocent
the
remorse
of
the
guilty
i
have
no
faith
either
in
the
remorse
of
m
fouquet
or
the
tears
of
his
friends
because
the
one
is
tainted
to
the
very
heart
and
the
others
ought
to
dread
offending
me
in
my
own
palace
for
these
reasons
i
beg
you
monsieur
pelisson
monsieur
gourville
and
you
monsieur
to
say
nothing
that
will
not
plainly
proclaim
the
respect
you
have
for
my
will
sire
replied
pelisson
trembling
at
these
words
we
are
come
to
say
nothing
to
your
majesty
that
is
not
the
most
profound
expression
of
the
most
sincere
respect
and
love
that
are
due
to
a
king
from
all
his
subjects
your
majestys
justice
is

the

a
warlike
figure
appeared
upon
the

resplendent
in
the
full
light
of
the
sun
this
was
dartagnan
who
had
come
alone
to
the
gate
and
finding
nobody
to
hold
his
stirrup
had
tied
his
horse
to
the
knocker
and
announced
himself
the
splendor
of
daylight
invading
the
room
the
murmur
of
all
present
and
more
than
all
the
instinct
of
the
faithful
dog
drew
mousqueton
from
his
reverie
he
raised
his
head
recognized
the
old
friend
of
his
master
and
screaming
with
grief
he
embraced
his
knees
watering
the
floor
with
his
tears
dartagnan
raised
the
poor
intendant
embraced
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
brother
and
having
nobly
saluted
the
assembly
who
all
bowed
as
they
whispered
to
each
other
his
name
he
went
and
took
his
seat
at
the
extremity
of
the
great
carved
oak
hall
still
holding
by
the
hand
poor
mousqueton
who
was
suffocating
with
excess
of
woe
and
sank
upon
the
steps
then
the
procureur
who
like
the
rest
was
considerably
agitated
commenced
porthos
after
a
profession
of
faith
of
the
most
christian
character
asked
pardon
of
his
enemies
for
all
the
injuries
he
might
have
done
them
at
this
paragraph
a
ray
of
inexpressible
pride
beamed
from
the
eyes
of
dartagnan
he
recalled
to
his
mind
the
old
soldier
all
those
enemies
of
porthos
brought
to
earth
by
his
valiant
hand
he
reckoned
up
the
numbers
of
them
and
said
to
himself
that
porthos
had
acted
wisely
not
to
enumerate
his
enemies
or
the
injuries
done
to
them
or
the
task
would
have
been
too
much
for
the
reader

resumed
i
have
lived
without
having
any
children
and
it
is
probable
i
never
shall
have
any
which
to
me
is
a
cutting
grief
and
yet
i
am
mistaken
for
i
have

this
young
nobleman
appears
to
me
extremely

am
the

humble

here
a
sharp
sound
interrupted
the
reader
it
was
dartagnans
sword
which
slipping
from
his
baldric
had
fallen
on
the
sonorous
flooring
every
one
turned
his
eyes
that
way
and
saw
that
a
large
tear
had
rolled
from
the
thick
lid
of
dartagnan
halfway
down
to
his
aquiline
nose
the
luminous
edge
of
which
shone
like
a
little
crescent
moon
this
is
why

murmur
ran
through
the
auditory
the
procureur
continued
seconded
by
the
flashing
eye
of
dartagnan
which
glancing
over
the
assembly
quickly
restored
the
interrupted
silence
on

they
are

the
love

in

bequeath
to

my
old

and
faithful
friend

already
named
providing
that
the
said
vicomte
shall
so
act
that
mousqueton
shall
declare
when
dying
he
has
never
ceased
to
be
happy
on
hearing
these
words
mousqueton
bowed
pale
and
trembling
his
shoulders
shook
convulsively
his
countenance
compressed
by
a
frightful
grief
appeared
from
between
his
icy
hands
and
the
spectators
saw
him
stagger
and
hesitate
as
if
though
wishing
to
leave
the
hall
he
did
not
know
the
way
mousqueton
my
good
friend
said
dartagnan
go
and
make
your
preparations
i
will
take
you
with
me
to
athoss
house
whither
i
shall
go
on
leaving
pierrefonds
mousqueton
made
no
reply
he
scarcely
breathed
as
if
everything
in
that
hall
would
from
that
time
be
foreign
he
opened
the
door
and
slowly
disappeared
the
procureur
finished
his
reading
after
which
the
greater
part
of
those
who
had
come
to
hear
the
last
will
of
porthos
dispersed
by
degrees
many
disappointed
but
all
penetrated
with
respect
as
for
dartagnan
thus
left
alone
after
having
received
the
formal
compliments
of
the
procureur
he
was
lost
in
admiration
of
the
wisdom
of
the
testator
who
had
so
judiciously
bestowed
his
wealth
upon
the
most
necessitous
and
the
most
worthy
with
a
delicacy
that
neither
nobleman
nor
courtier
could
have
displayed
more
kindly
when
porthos
enjoined
raoul
de
bragelonne
to
give
dartagnan
all
that
he
would
ask
he
knew
well
our
worthy
porthos
that
dartagnan
would
ask
or
take
nothing
and
in
case
he
did
demand
anything
none
but
himself
could
say
what
porthos
left
a
pension
to
aramis
who
if
he
should
be
inclined
to
ask
too
much
was
checked
by
the
example
of
dartagnan
and
that
word
exile
thrown
out
by
the
testator
without
apparent
intention
was
it
not
the
mildest
most
exquisite
criticism
upon
that
conduct
of
aramis
which
had
brought
about
the
death
of
porthos
but
there
was
no
mention
of
athos
in
the
testament
of
the
dead
could
the
latter
for
a
moment
suppose
that
the
son
would
not
offer
the
best
part
to
the
father
the
rough
mind
of
porthos
had
fathomed
all
these
causes
seized
all
these
shades
more
clearly
than
law
better
than
custom
with
more
propriety
than
taste
porthos
had
indeed
a
heart
said
dartagnan
to
himself
with
a
sigh
as
he
made
this
reflection
he
fancied
he
hard
a
groan
in
the
room
above
him
and
he
thought
immediately
of
poor
mousqueton
whom
he
felt
it
was
a
pleasing
duty
to
divert
from
his
grief
for
this
purpose
he
left
the
hall
hastily
to
seek
the
worthy
intendant
as
he
had
not
returned
he
ascended
the
staircase
leading
to
the
first
story
and
perceived
in
porthoss
own
chamber
a
heap
of
clothes
of
all
colors
and
materials
upon
which
mousqueton
had
laid
himself
down
after
heaping
them
all
on
the
floor
together
it
was
the
legacy
of
the
faithful
friend
those
clothes
were
truly
his
own
they
had
been
given
to
him
the
hand
of
mousqueton
was
stretched
over
these
relics
which
he
was
kissing
with
his
lips
with
all
his
face
and
covered
with
his
body
dartagnan
approached
to
console
the
poor
fellow
my
god
said
he
he
does
not
stirhe
has
fainted
but
dartagnan
was
mistaken
mousqueton
was
dead
dead

dog

the

forever

bound
together

manner

indissoluble
athos

alone
after
the
departure
of
raoul
began
to
pay
his
tribute
to
that
foretaste
of
death
which
is
called
the
absence
of
those
we
love
back
in
his
house
at
blois
no
longer
having
even
grimaud
to
receive
a
poor
smile
as
he
passed
through
the
parterre
athos
daily
felt
the
decline
of
vigor
of
a
nature
which
for
so
long
a
time
had
seemed
impregnable

which
had
been
kept
back
by
the
presence
of
the
beloved

with
that
cortege
of
pains
and
inconveniences
which
grows
by
geometrical
accretion
athos
had
no
longer
his
son
to
induce
him
to
walk
firmly
with
head
erect
as
a
good
example
he
had
no
longer
in
those
brilliant
eyes
of
the
young
man
an
everardent
focus
at
which

kindle
anew
the
fire

his
looks

then
must
it
be
said
that
nature
exquisite
in
tenderness
and
reserve
no
longer
finding
anything
to
understand
its
feelings
gave
itself
up
to
grief
with
all
the
warmth
of
common
natures

his
sixtysecond

strength

athos
had
become
an
old
man
in
a
week
from
the
moment
at
which
he
lost
the
comfort
of
his
later
youth
still
handsome
though
bent
noble
but
sad
he
sought
since
his
solitude
the
deeper
glades
where
sunshine
scarcely
penetrated
he
discontinued
all
the
mighty
exercises
he
had
enjoyed
through
life
when
raoul
was
no
longer
with
him
the
servants
accustomed
to
see
him
stirring
with
the
dawn
at
all
seasons
were
astonished
to
hear
seven
oclock
strike
before
their
master
quitted
his
bed
athos
remained
in
bed
with
a
book
under
his
pillowbut
he
did
not
sleep
neither
did
he
read
remaining
in
bed
that
he
might
no
longer
have
to
carry
his
body
he
allowed
his
soul
and
spirit
to
wander
from
their
envelope
and
return
to
his
son
or
to
god
6
his
people
were
sometimes
terrified
to
see
him
for
hours
together
absorbed
in
silent
reverie
mute
and
insensible
he
no
longer
heard
the
timid
step
of
the
servant
who
came
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
to
watch
the
sleeping
or
waking
of
his
master
it
often
occurred
that
he
forgot
the
day
had
half
passed
away
that
the
hours
for
the
two
first
meals
were
gone
by
then
he
was
awakened
he
rose
descended
to
his
shady
walk
then
came
out
a
little
into
the
sun
as
though
to
partake
of
its
warmth
for
a
minute
in
memory
of
his
absent
child
and
then
the
dismal
monotonous
walk
recommenced
until
exhausted
he
regained
the
chamber
and
his
bed
his
domicile
by
choice
for
several
days
the
comte
did
not
speak
a
single
word
he
refused
to
receive
the
visits
that
were
paid
him
and
during
the
night
he
was
seen
to
relight
his
lamp
and
pass
long
hours
in
writing
or
examining
parchments
athos
wrote
one
of
these
letters
to
vannes
another
to
fontainebleau
they
remained
without
answers
we
know
why
aramis
had
quitted
france
and
dartagnan
was
traveling
from
nantes
to
paris
from
paris
to
pierrefonds
his
valet
de
chambre
observed
that
he
shortened
his
walk
every
day
by
several
turns
the
great
alley
of
limes
soon
became
too
long
for
feet
that
used
to
traverse
it
formerly
a
hundred
times
a
day
the
comte
walked
feebly
as
far
as
the
middle
trees
seated
himself
upon
a
mossy
bank
that
sloped
towards
a
sidewalk
and
there
waited
the
return
of
his
strength
or
rather
the
return
of
night
very
shortly
a
hundred
steps
exhausted
him
at
length
athos
refused
to
rise
at
all
he
declined
all
nourishment
and
his
terrified
people
although
he
did
not
complain
although
he
wore
a
smile
upon
his
lips
although
he
continued
to
speak
with
his
sweet
voicehis
people
went
to
blois
in
search
of
the
ancient
physician
of
the
late
monsieur
and
brought
him
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
could
see
the
comte
without
being
himself
seen
for
this
purpose
they
placed
him
in
a
closet
adjoining
the
chamber
of
the
patient
and
implored
him
not
to
show
himself
for
fear
of
displeasing
their
master
who
had
not
asked
for
a
physician
the
doctor
obeyed
athos
was
a
sort
of
model
for
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
the
blaisois
boasted
of
possessing
this
sacred
relic
of
french
glory
athos
was
a
great
seigneur
compared
with
such
nobles
as
the
king
improvised
by
touching
with
his
artificial
scepter
the
patchedup
trunks
of
the
heraldic
trees
of
the
province
people
respected
athos
we
say
and
they
loved
him
the
physician
could
not
bear
to
see
his
people
weep
to
see
flock
round
him
the
poor
of
the
canton
to
whom
athos
had
so
often
given
life
and
consolation
by
his
kind
words
and
his
charities
he
examined
therefore
from
the
depths
of
his
hidingplace
the
nature
of
that
mysterious
malady
which
bent
and
aged
more
mortally
every
day
a
man
but
lately
so
full
of
life
and
a
desire
to
live
he
remarked
upon
the
cheeks
of
athos
the
hectic
hue
of
fever
which
feeds
upon
itself
slow
fever
pitiless
born
in
a
fold
of
the
heart
sheltering
itself
behind
that
rampart
growing
from
the
suffering
it
engenders
at
once
cause
and
effect
of
a
perilous
situation
the
comte
spoke
to
nobody
he
did
not
even
talk
to
himself
his
thought
feared
noise
it
approached
to
that
degree
of
overexcitement
which
borders
upon
ecstasy
man
thus
absorbed
though
he
does
not
yet
belong
to
god
already
appertains
no
longer
to
the
earth
the
doctor
remained
for
several
hours
studying
this
painful
struggle
of
the
will
against
superior
power
he
was
terrified
at
seeing
those
eyes
always
fixed
ever
directed
on
some
invisible
object
was
terrified
at
the
monotonous
beating
of
that
heart
from
which
never
a
sigh
arose
to
vary
the
melancholy
state
for
often
pain
becomes
the
hope
of
the
physician
half
a
day
passed
away
thus
the
doctor
formed
his
resolution
like
a
brave
man
he
issued
suddenly
from
his
place
of
retreat
and
went
straight
up
to
athos
who
beheld
him
without
evincing
more
surprise
than
if
he
had
understood
nothing
of
the
apparition
monsieur
le
comte
i
crave
your
pardon
said
the
doctor
coming
up
to
the
patient
with
open
arms
but
i
have
a
reproach
to
make
youyou
shall
hear
me
and
he
seated
himself
by
the
pillow
of
athos
who
had
great
trouble
in
rousing
himself
from
his
preoccupation
what
is
the
matter
doctor
asked
the
comte
after
a
silence
the
matter
is

are
ill

and
have
had
no

the
doctor
knew
the
temper
of
that
mind
he
appreciated
the
strength
of
that
body
he
reflected
for
the
moment
told
himself
that
words
were
useless
remedies
absurd
and
left
the
chateau
exhorting
athoss
servants
not
to
quit
him
for
a
moment
the
doctor
being
gone
athos
evinced
neither
anger
nor
vexation
at
having
been
disturbed
he
did
not
even
desire
that
all
letters
that
came
should
be
brought
to
him
directly
he
knew
very
well
that
every
distraction
which
should
arise
would
be
a
joy
a
hope
which
his
servants
would
have
paid
with
their
blood
to
procure
him
sleep
had
become
rare
by
intense
thinking
athos
forgot
himself
for
a
few
hours
at
most
in
a
reverie
most
profound
more
obscure
than
other
people
would
have
called
a
dream
the
momentary
repose
which
this
forgetfulness
thus
gave
the
body
still
further
fatigued
the
soul
for
athos
lived
a
double
life
during
these
wanderings
of
his
understanding
one
night
he
dreamt
that
raoul
was
dressing
himself
in
a
tent
to
go
upon
an
expedition
commanded
by
m
de
beaufort
in
person
the
young
man
was
sad
he
clasped
his
cuirass
slowly
and
slowly
he
girded
on
his
sword
what
is
the
matter
asked
his
father
tenderly
what
afflicts
me
is
the
death
of
porthos
ever
so
dear
a
friend
replied
raoul
i
suffer
here
the
grief
you
soon
will
feel
at
home
and
the
vision
disappeared
with
the
slumber
of
athos
at
daybreak
one
of
his
servants
entered
his
masters
apartment
and
gave
him
a
letter
which
came
from
spain
the
writing
of
aramis
thought
the
comte
and
he
read
porthos
is
dead
cried
he
after
the
first
lines
oh
raoul
raoul
thanks
thou
keepest
thy
promise
thou
warnest
me
and
athos
seized
with
a
mortal
sweat
fainted
in
his
bed
without
any
other
cause
than
weakness
chapter
lvii
athoss
vision
when
this
fainting
of
athos
had
ceased
the
comte
almost
ashamed
of
having
given
way
before
this
superior
natural
event
dressed
himself
and
ordered
his
horse
determined
to
ride
to
blois
to
open
more
certain
correspondences
with
either
africa
dartagnan
or
aramis
in
fact
this
letter
from
aramis
informed
the
comte
de
la
fere
of
the
bad
success
of
the
expedition
of
belleisle
it
gave
him
sufficient
details
of
the
death
of
porthos
to
move
the
tender
and
devoted
heart
of
athos
to
its
innermost
fibers
athos
wished
to
go
and
pay
his
friend
porthos
a
last
visit
to
render
this
honor
to
his
companion
in
arms
he
meant
to
send
to
dartagnan
to
prevail
upon
him
to
recommence
the
painful
voyage
to
belleisle
to
accomplish
in
his
company
that
sad
pilgrimage
to
the
tomb
of
the
giant
he
had
so
much
loved
then
to
return
to
his
dwelling
to
obey
that
secret
influence
which
was
conducting
him
to
eternity
by
a
mysterious
road
but
scarcely
had
his
joyous
servants
dressed
their
master
whom
they
saw
with
pleasure
preparing
for
a
journey
which
might
dissipate
his
melancholy
scarcely
had
the
comtes
gentlest
horse
been
saddled
and
brought
to
the
door
when
the
father
of
raoul
felt
his
head
become
confused
his
legs
give
way
and
he
clearly
perceived
the
impossibility
of
going
one
step
further
he
ordered
himself
to
be
carried
into
the
sun
they
laid
him
upon
his
bed
of
moss
where
he
passed
a
full
hour
before
he
could
recover
his
spirits
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
this
weakness
after
then
inert
repose
of
the
latter
days
athos
took
a
bouillon
to
give
him
strength
and
bathed
his
dried
lips
in
a
glassful
of
the
wine
he
loved
the
bestthat
old
anjou
wine
mentioned
by
porthos
in
his
admirable
will
then
refreshed
free
in
mind
he
had
his
horse
brought
again
but
only
with
the
aid
of
his
servants
was
he
able
painfully
to
climb
into
the
saddle
he
did
not
go
a
hundred
paces
a
shivering
seized
him
again
at
the
turning
of
the
road
this
is
very
strange
said
he
to
his
valet
de
chambre
who
accompanied
him
let
us
stop
monsieuri
conjure
you
replied
the
faithful
servant
how
pale
you
are
getting
that
will
not
prevent
my
pursuing
my
route
now
i
have
once
started
replied
the
comte
and
he
gave
his
horse
his
head
again
but
suddenly
the
animal
instead
of
obeying
the
thought
of
his
master
stopped
a
movement
of
which
athos
was
unconscious
had
checked
the
bit
something
said
athos
wills
that
i
should
go
no
further
support
me
added
he
stretching
out
his
arms
quick
come
closer
i
feel
my
muscles
relaxi
shall
fall
from
my
horse
the
valet
had
seen
the
movement
made
by
his
master
at
the
moment
he
received
the
order
he
went
up
to
him
quickly
received
the
comte
in
his
arms
and
as
they
were
not
yet
sufficiently
distant
from
the
house
for
the
servants
who
had
remained
at
the
door
to
watch
their
masters
departure
not
to
perceive
the
disorder
in
the
usually
regular
proceeding
of
the
comte
the
valet
called
his
comrades
by
gestures
and
voice
and
all
hastened
to
his
assistance
athos
had
gone
but
a
few
steps
on
his
return
when
he
felt
himself
better
again
his
strength
seemed
to
revive
and
with
it
the
desire
to
go
to
blois
he
made
his
horse
turn
round
but
at
the
animals
first
steps
he
sunk
again
into
a
state
of
torpor
and
anguish
well
decidedly
said
he
it
is
willed
that
i
should
stay
at
home
his
people
flocked
around
him
they
lifted
him
from
his
horse
and
carried
him
as
quickly
as
possible
into
the
house
everything
was
prepared
in
his
chamber
and
they
put
him
to
bed
you
will
be
sure
to
remember
said
he
disposing
himself
to
sleep
that
i
expect
letters
from
africa
this
very
day
monsieur
will
no
doubt
hear
with
pleasure
that
blaisoiss
son
is
gone
on
horseback
to
gain
an
hour
over
the
courier
of
blois
replied
his
valet
de
chambre
thank
you
replied
athos
with
his
placid
smile
the
comte
fell
asleep
but
his
disturbed
slumber
resembled
torture
rather
than
repose
the
servant
who
watched
him
saw
several
times
the
expression
of
internal
suffering
shadowed
on
his
features
perhaps
athos
was
dreaming
the
day
passed
away
blaisoiss
son
returned
the
courier
had
brought
no
news
the
comte
reckoned
the
minutes
with
despair
he
shuddered
when
those
minutes
made
an
hour
the
idea
that
he
was
forgotten
seized
him
once
and
brought
on
a
fearful
pang
of
the
heart
everybody
in
the
house
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
the
courierhis
hour
had
long
passed
four
times
the
express
sent
to
blois
had
repeated
his
journey
and
there
was
nothing
to
the
address
of
the
comte
athos
knew
that
the
courier
only
arrived
once
a
week
here
then
was
a
delay
of
eight
mortal
days
to
be
endured
he
commenced
the
night
in
this
painful
persuasion
all
that
a
sick
man
irritated
by
suffering
can
add
of
melancholy
suppositions
to
probabilities
already
gloomy
athos
heaped
up
during
the
early
hours
of
this
dismal
night
the
fever
rose
it
invaded
the
chest
where
the
fire
soon
caught
according
to
the
expression
of
the
physician
who
had
been
brought
back
from
blois
by
blaisois
at
his
last
journey
soon
it
gained
the
head
the
physician
made
two
successive
bleedings
which
dislodged
it
for
the
time
but
left
the
patient
very
weak
and
without
power
of
action
in
anything
but
his
brain
and
yet
this
redoubtable
fever
had
ceased
it
besieged
with
its
last
palpitations
the
tense
extremities
it
ended
by
yielding
as
midnight
struck
the
physician
seeing
the
incontestable
improvement
returned
to
blois
after
having
ordered
some
prescriptions
and
declared
that
the
comte
was
saved
then
commenced
for
athos
a
strange
indefinable
state
free
to
think
his
mind
turned
towards
raoul
that
beloved
son
his
imagination
penetrated
the
fields
of
africa
in
the
environs
of
gigelli
where
m
de
beaufort
must
have
landed
with
his
army
a
waste
of
gray
rocks
rendered
green
in
certain
parts
by
the
waters
of
the
sea
when
it
lashed
the
shore
in
storms
and
tempest
beyond
the
shore
strewed
over
with
these
rocks
like
gravestones
ascended
in
form
of
an
amphitheater
among
mastictrees
and
cactus
a
sort
of
small
town
full
of
smoke
confused
noises
and
terrified
movements
all
of
a
sudden
from
the
bosom
of
this
smoke
arose
a
flame
which
succeeded
creeping
along
the
houses
in
covering
the
entire
surface
of
the
town
and
increased
by
degrees
uniting
in
its
red
and
angry
vortices
tears
screams
and
supplicating
arms
outstretched
to
heaven
there
was
for
a
moment
a
frightful
pelemele
of
timbers
falling
to
pieces
of
swords
broken
of
stones
calcined
trees
burnt
and
disappearing
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
in
this
chaos
in
which
athos
distinguished
raised
arms
in
which
he
heard
cries
sobs
and
groans
he
did
not
see
one
human
figure
the
cannon
thundered
at
a
distance
musketry
madly
barked
the
sea
moaned
flocks
made
their
escape
bounding
over
the
verdant
slope
but
not
a
soldier
to
apply
the
match
to
the
batteries
of
cannon
not
a
sailor
to
assist
in
maneuvering
the
fleet
not
a
shepherd
in
charge
of
the
flocks
after
the
ruin
of
the
village
the
destruction
of
the
forts
which
dominated
it
a
ruin
and
destruction
magically
wrought
without
the
cooperation
of
a
single
human
being
the
flames
were
extinguished
the
smoke
began
to
subside
then
diminished
in
intensity
paled
and
disappeared
entirely
night
then
came
over
the
scene
night
dark
upon
the
earth
brilliant
in
the
firmament
the
large
blazing
stars
which
spangled
the
african
sky
glittered
and
gleamed
without
illuminating
anything
a
long
silence
ensued
which
gave
for
a
moment
repose
to
the
troubled
imagination
of
athos
and
as
he
felt
that
that
which
he
saw
was
not
terminated
he
applied
more
attentively
the
eyes
of
his
understanding
on
the
strange
spectacle
which
his
imagination
had
presented
this
spectacle
was
soon
continued
for
him
a
mild
pale
moon
rose
behind
the
declivities
of
the
coast
streaking
at
first
the
undulating
ripples
of
the
sea
which
appeared
to
have
calmed
after
the
roaring
it
had
sent
forth
during
the
vision
of
athosthe
moon
we
say
shed
its
diamonds
and
opals
upon
the
briers
and
bushes
of
the
hills
the
gray
rocks
so
many
silent
and
attentive
phantoms
appeared
to
raise
their
heads
to
examine
likewise
the
field
of
battle
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
athos
perceived
that
the
field
empty
during
the
combat
was
now
strewn
with
fallen
bodies
an
inexpressible
shudder
of
fear
and
horror
seized
his
soul
as
he
recognized
the
white
and
blue
uniforms
of
the
soldiers
of
picardy
with
their
long
pikes
and
blue
handles
and
muskets
marked
with
the
fleurdelis
on
the
butts
when
he
saw
all
the
gaping
wounds
looking
up
to
the
bright
heavens
as
if
to
demand
back
of
them
the
souls
to
which
they
had
opened
a
passagewhen
he
saw
the
slaughtered
horses
stiff
their
tongues
hanging
out
at
one
side
of
their
mouths
sleeping
in
the
shiny
blood
congealed
around
them
staining
their
furniture
and
their
maneswhen
he
saw
the
white
horse
of
m
de
beaufort
with
his
head
beaten
to
pieces
in
the
first
ranks
of
the
dead
athos
passed
a
cold
hand
over
his
brow
which
he
was
astonished
not
to
find
burning
he
was
convinced
by
this
touch
that
he
was
present
as
a
spectator
without
deliriums
dreadful
aid
the
day
after
the
battle
fought
upon
the
shores
of
gigelli
by
the
army
of
the
expedition
which
he
had
seen
leave
the
coast
of
france
and
disappear
upon
the
dim
horizon
and
of
which
he
had
saluted
with
thought
and
gesture
the
last
cannonshot
fired
by
the
duke
as
a
signal
of
farewell
to
his
country
who
can
paint
the
mortal
agony
with
which
his
soul
followed
like
a
vigilant
eye
these
effigies
of
claycold
soldiers
and
examined
them
one
after
the
other
to
see
if
raoul
slept
among
them
who
can
express
the
intoxication
of
joy
with
which
athos
bowed
before
god
and
thanked
him
for
not
having
seen
him
he
sought
with
so
much
fear
among
the
dead
in
fact
fallen
in
their
ranks
stiff
icy
the
dead
still
recognizable
with
ease
seemed
to
turn
with
complacency
towards
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
be
the
better
seen
by
him
during
his
sad
review
but
yet
he
was
astonished
while
viewing
all
these
bodies
not
to
perceive
the
survivors
to
such
a
point
did
the
illusion
extend
that
this
vision
was
for
him
a
real
voyage
made
by
the
father
into
africa
to
obtain
more
exact
information
respecting
his
son
fatigued
therefore
with
having
traversed
seas
and
continents
he
sought
repose
under
one
of
the
tents
sheltered
behind
a
rock
on
the
top
of
which
floated
the
white
fleurdelised
pennon
he
looked
for
a
soldier
to
conduct
him
to
the
tent
of
m
de
beaufort
then
while
his
eye
was
wandering
over
the
plain
turning
on
all
sides
he
saw
a
white
form
appear
behind
the
scented
myrtles
this
figure
was
clothed
in
the
costume
of
an
officer
it
held
in
its
hand
a
broken
sword
it
advanced
slowly
towards
athos
who
stopping
short
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
it
neither
spoke
nor
moved
but
wished
to
open
his
arms
because
in
this
silent
officer
he
had
already
recognized
raoul
the
comte
attempted
to
utter
a
cry
but
it
was
stifled
in
his
throat
raoul
with
a
gesture
directed
him
to
be
silent
placing
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
drawing
back
by
degrees
without
athos
being
able
to
see
his
legs
move
the
comte
still
paler
than
raoul
followed
his
son
painfully
traversing
briers
and
bushes
stones
and
ditches
raoul
not
appearing
to
touch
the
earth
no
obstacle
seeming
to
impede
the
lightness
of
his
march
the
comte
whom
the
inequalities
of
the
path
fatigued
soon
stopped
exhausted
raoul
still
continued
to
beckon
him
to
follow
him
the
tender
father
to
whom
love
restored
strength
made
a
last
effort
and
climbed
the
mountain
after
the
young
man
who
attracted
him
by
gesture
and
by
smile
at
length
he
gained
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
saw
thrown
out
in
black
upon
the
horizon
whitened
by
the
moon
the
aerial
form
of
raoul
athos
reached
forth
his
hand
to
get
closer
to
his
beloved
son
upon
the
plateau
and
the
latter
also
stretched
out
his
but
suddenly
as
if
the
young
man
had
been
drawn
away
in
his
own
despite
still
retreating
he
left
the
earth
and
athos
saw
the
clear
blue
sky
shine
between
the
feet
of
his
child
and
the
ground
of
the
hill
raoul
rose
insensibly
into
the
void
smiling
still
calling
with
gesturehe
departed
towards
heaven
athos
uttered
a
cry
of
tenderness
and
terror
he
looked
below
again
he
saw
a
camp
destroyed
and
all
those
white
bodies
of
the
royal
army
like
so
many
motionless
atoms
and
then
raising
his
head
he
saw
the
figure
of
his
son
still
beckoning
him
to
climb
the
mystic
void
chapter
lviii
the
angel
of
death
athos
was
at
this
part
of
his
marvelous
vision
when
the
charm
was
suddenly
broken
by
a
great
noise
rising
from
the
outer
gates
a
horse
was
heard
galloping
over
the
hard
gravel
of
the
great
alley
and
the
sound
of
noisy
and
animated
conversations
ascended
to
the
chamber
in
which
the
comte
was
dreaming
athos
did
not
stir
from
the
place
he
occupied
he
scarcely
turned
his
head
towards
the
door
to
ascertain
the
sooner
what
these
noises
could
be
a
heavy
step
ascended
the
stairs
the
horse
which
had
recently
galloped
departed
slowly
towards
the
stables
great
hesitation
appeared
in
the
steps
which
by
degrees
approached
the
chamber
a
door
was
opened
and
athos
turning
a
little
towards
the
part
of
the
room
the
noise
came
from
cried
in
a
weak
voice
it
is
a
courier
from
africa
is
it
not
no
monsieur
le
comte
replied
a
voice
which
made
the
father
of
raoul
start
upright
in
his
bed
grimaud
murmured
he
and
the
sweat
began
to
pour
down
his
face
grimaud
appeared
in
the
doorway
it
was
no
longer
the
grimaud
we
have
seen
still
young
with
courage
and
devotion
when
he
jumped
the
first
into
the
boat
destined
to
convey
raoul
de
bragelonne
to
the
vessels
of
the
royal
fleet
twas
now
a
stern
and
pale
old
man
his
clothes
covered
with
dust
and
hair
whitened
by
old
age
he
trembled
whilst
leaning
against
the
doorframe
and
was
near
falling
on
seeing
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
the
countenance
of
his
master
these
two
men
who
had
lived
so
long
together
in
a
community
of
intelligence
and
whose
eyes
accustomed
to
economize
expressions
knew
how
to
say
so
many
things
silentlythese
two
old
friends
one
as
noble
as
the
other
in
heart
if
they
were
unequal
in
fortune
and
birth
remained
tonguetied
whilst
looking
at
each
other
by
the
exchange
of
a
single
glance
they
had
just
read
to
the
bottom
of
each
others
hearts
the
old
servitor
bore
upon
his
countenance
the
impression
of
a
grief
already
old
the
outward
token
of
a
grim
familiarity
with
woe
he
appeared
to
have
no
longer
in
use
more
than
a
single
version
of
his
thoughts
as
formerly
he
was
accustomed
not
to
speak
much
he
was
now
accustomed
not
to
smile
at
all
athos
read
at
a
glance
all
these
shades
upon
the
visage
of
his
faithful
servant
and
in
the
same
tone
he
would
have
employed
to
speak
to
raoul
in
his
dream
grimaud
said
he
raoul
is
dead
is
it
not
so
behind
grimaud
the
other
servants
listened
breathlessly
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
bed
of
their
sick
master
they
heard
the
terrible
question
and
a
heartbreaking
silence
followed
yes
replied
the
old
man
heaving
the
monosyllable
from
his
chest
with
a
hoarse
broken
sigh
then
arose
voices
of
lamentation
which
groaned
without
measure
and
filled
with
regrets
and
prayers
the
chamber
where
the
agonized
father
sought
with
his
eyes
the
portrait
of
his
son
this
was
for
athos
like
the
transition
which
led
to
his
dream
without
uttering
a
cry
without
shedding
a
tear
patient
mild
resigned
as
a
martyr
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
heaven
in
order
there
to
see
again
rising
above
the
mountain
of
gigelli
the
beloved
shade
that
was
leaving
him
at
the
moment
of
grimauds
arrival
without
doubt
while
looking
towards
the
heavens
resuming
his
marvelous
dream
he
repassed
by
the
same
road
by
which
the
vision
at
once
so
terrible
and
sweet
had
led
him
before
for
after
having
gently
closed
his
eyes
he
reopened
them
and
began
to
smile
he
had
just
seen
raoul
who
had
smiled
upon
him
with
his
hands
joined
upon
his
breast
his
face
turned
towards
the
window
bathed
by
the
fresh
air
of
night
which
brought
upon
its
wings
the
aroma
of
the
flowers
and
the
woods
athos
entered
never
again
to
come
out
of
it
into
the
contemplation
of
that
paradise
which
the
living
never
see
god
willed
no
doubt
to
open
to
this
elect
the
treasures
of
eternal
beatitude
at
this
hour
when
other
men
tremble
with
the
idea
of
being
severely
received
by
the
lord
and
cling
to
this
life
they
know
in
the
dread
of
the
other
life
of
which
they
get
but
merest
glimpses
by
the
dismal
murky
torch
of
death
athos
was
spiritguided
by
the
pure
serene
soul
of
his
son
which
aspired
to
be
like
the
paternal
soul
everything
for
this
just
man
was
melody
and
perfume
in
the
rough
road
souls
take
to
return
to
the
celestial
country
after
an
hour
of
this
ecstasy
athos
softly
raised
his
hands
as
white
as
wax
the
smile
did
not
quit
his
lips
and
he
murmured
low
so
low
as
scarcely
to
be
audible
these
three
words
addressed
to
god
or
to
raoul
here
i
am
and
his
hands
fell
slowly
as
though
he
himself
had
laid
them
on
the
bed
death
had
been
kind
and
mild
to
this
noble
creature
it
had
spared
him
the
tortures
of
the
agony
convulsions
of
the
last
departure
had
opened
with
an
indulgent
finger
the
gates
of
eternity
to
that
noble
soul
god
had
no
doubt
ordered
it
thus
that
the
pious
remembrance
of
this
death
should
remain
in
the
hearts
of
those
present
and
in
the
memory
of
other
mena
death
which
caused
to
be
loved
the
passage
from
this
life
to
the
other
by
those
whose
existence
upon
this
earth
leads
them
not
to
dread
the
last
judgment
athos
preserved
even
in
the
eternal
sleep
that
placid
and
sincere
smilean
ornament
which
was
to
accompany
him
to
the
tomb
the
quietude
and
calm
of
his
fine
features
made
his
servants
for
a
long
time
doubt
whether
he
had
really
quitted

from
a
distance
devoured

and
did
not
approach
from
pious
fear
of
bringing
to
him
the
breath
of
death
but
grimaud
fatigued
as
he
was
refused
to
leave
the
room
he
sat
himself
down
upon
the
threshold
watching
his
master
with
the
vigilance
of
a
sentinel
jealous
to
receive
either
his
first
waking
look

his
last
dying
sigh

but
grimaud
by
anxiously
listening
perceived
that
the

no
longer
breathed
he
raised
himself
with
his
hands
leaning
on
the
ground
looked
to
see
if
there
did
not
appear

motion
in
the
body

his
master
nothing
fear
seized
him
he
rose
completely
up
and
at
the
very
moment
heard
some
one
coming
up
the
stairs
a
noise
of
spurs

against

to

the

floor
his
heart
rent
by
a
nameless
agony
he
placed
his
ear
to
the
breast
of
athos
his
face
to
the
comtes
mouth
neither
noise
nor
breath
dartagnan
drew
back
grimaud
who
had
followed
him
with
his
eyes
and
for
whom
each
of
his
movements
had
been
a
revelation
came
timidly
seated
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
glued
his
lips
to
the
sheet
which
was
raised
by
the
stiffened
feet
of
his
master
then
large
drops
began
to
flow
from
his
red
eyes
this
old
man
in
invincible
despair
who
wept
bent
doubled
without
uttering
a
word
presented
the
most
touching
spectacle
that
dartagnan
in
a
life
so
filled
with
emotion
had
ever
met
with
the
captain
resumed
standing
in
contemplation
before
that
smiling
dead
man
who
seemed
to
have
burnished
his
last
thought
to
give
his
best
friend
the
man
he
had
loved
next
to
raoul
a
gracious
welcome
even
beyond
life
and
for
reply
to
that
exalted
flattery
of
hospitality
dartagnan
went
and
kissed
athos
fervently
on
the
brow
and
with
his
trembling
fingers
closed
his
eyes
then
he
seated
himself
by
the
pillow
without
dread
of
that
dead
man
who
had
been
so
kind
and
affectionate
to
him
for
five
and
thirty
years
he
was
feeding
his
soul
with
the
remembrances
the
noble
visage
of
the
comte
brought
to
his
mind
in
crowdssome
blooming
and
charming
as
that
smilesome
dark
dismal
and
icy
as
that
visage
with
its
eyes
now
closed
to
all
eternity
all
at
once
the
bitter
flood
which
mounted
from
minute
to
minute
invaded
his
heart
and
swelled
his
breast
almost
to
bursting
incapable
of
mastering
his
emotion
he
arose
and
tearing
himself
violently
from
the
chamber
where
he
had
just
found
dead
him
to
whom
he
came
to
report
the
news
of
the
death
of
porthos
he
uttered
sobs
so
heartrending
that
the
servants
who
seemed
only
to
wait
for
an
explosion
of
grief
answered
to
it
by
their
lugubrious
clamors
and
the
dogs
of
the
late
comte
by
their
lamentable
howlings
grimaud
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
lift
up
his
voice
even
in
the
paroxysm
of
his
grief
he
would
not
have
dared
to
profane
the
dead
or
for
the
first
time
disturb
the
slumber
of
his
master

not
athos
always
bidden
him
be
dumb
at
daybreak

who
had
wandered
about
the
lower
hall
biting
his
fingers
to
stifle
his
sighsdartagnan
went
up
once
more
and
watching
the
moments
when
grimaud
turned
his
head
towards
him
he
made
him
a
sign
to
come
to
him
which
the
faithful
servant
obeyed
without
making
more
noise
than
a
shadow
dartagnan
went
down
again
followed
by
grimaud
and
when
he
had
gained
the
vestibule
taking
the
old
mans
hands

said

i

seen
how

me

drew
from
his
breast
a
large
letter
upon
the
envelope
of
which
was
traced

address

the

of

at

the
regiments
formed
in

and
advancing
against
the
ramparts
were
rather
roughly
handled
there
was
a
sort
of
hesitation
in
our
troops
who
found
themselves
illseconded
by
the
artillery
in
fact
the
batteries
which
had
been
established
the
evening

but
a
weak
and
uncertain
aim
on
account
of
their
position
the
upward
direction
of
the
aim
lessened
the
justness
of

shots

well
as

range
monseigneur
comprehending
the
bad
effect
of
this
position
on
the
siege
artillery
commanded
the
frigates
moored
in
the
little
road
to
commence
a
regular
fire
against
the
place
m
de
bragelonne
offered
himself
at
once
to
carry
this
order
but
monseigneur
refused
to
acquiesce
in
the
vicomtes
request
monseigneur
was
right
for
he
loved
and
wished
to
spare
the
young
nobleman
he
was
quite
right
and
the
event
took
upon
itself
to
justify
his
foresight
and
refusal
for
scarcely
had
the
sergeant
charged
with
the
message
solicited
by
m
de
bragelonne
gained
the
seashore
when
two
shots
from
long
carbines
issued
from
the
enemys
ranks
and
laid
him
low
the
sergeant
fell
dyeing
the
sand
with
his
blood
observing
which
m
de
bragelonne
smiled
at
monseigneur
who
said
to
him
you
see
vicomte
i
have
saved
your
life
report
that
some
day
to
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
in
order
that
learning
it
from
you
he
may
thank
me
the
young
nobleman
smiled
sadly
and
replied
to
the
duke
it
is
true
monseigneur
that
but
for
your
kindness
i
should
have
been
killed
where
the
poor
sergeant
has
fallen
and
should
be
at
rest
m
de
bragelonne
made
this
reply
in
such
a
tone
that
monseigneur
answered
him
warmly
vrai
dieu
young
man
one
would
say
that
your
mouth
waters
for
death
but
by
the
soul
of
henry
iv
i
have
promised
your
father
to
bring
you
back
alive
and
please
the
lord
i
mean
to
keep
my
word
monseigneur
de
bragelonne
colored
and
replied
in
a
lower
voice
monseigneur
pardon
me
i
beseech
you
i
have
always
had
a
desire
to
meet
good
opportunities
and
it
is
so
delightful
to
distinguish
ourselves
before
our
general
particularly
when
that
general
is
m
le
duc
de
beaufort
monseigneur
was
a
little
softened
by
this
and
turning
to
the
officers
who
surrounded
him
gave
different
orders
the
grenadiers
of
the
two
regiments
got
near
enough
to
the
ditches
and
intrenchments
to
launch
their
grenades
which
had
but
small
effect
in
the
meanwhile
m
destrees
who
commanded
the
fleet
having
seen
the
attempt
of
the
sergeant
to
approach
the
vessels
understood
that
he
must
act
without
orders
and
opened
fire
then
the
arabs
finding
themselves
seriously
injured
by
the
balls
from
the
fleet
and
beholding
the
destruction
and
the
ruin
of
their
walls
uttered
the
most
fearful
cries
their
horsemen
descended
the
mountain
at
a
gallop
bent
over
their
saddles
and
rushed
full
tilt
upon
the
columns
of
infantry
which
crossing
their
pikes
stopped
this
mad
assault
repulsed
by
the
firm
attitude
of
the
battalion
the
arabs
threw
themselves
with
fury
towards
the
etatmajor
which
was
not
on
its
guard
at
that
moment
the
danger
was
great
monseigneur
drew
his
sword
his
secretaries
and
people
imitated
him
the
officers
of
the
suite
engaged
in
combat
with
the
furious
arabs
it
was
then
m
de
bragelonne
was
able
to
satisfy
the
inclination
he
had
so
clearly
shown
from
the
commencement
of
the
action
he
fought
near
the
prince
with
the
valor
of
a
roman
and
killed
three
arabs
with
his
small
sword
but
it
was
evident
that
his
bravery
did
not
arise
from
that
sentiment
of
pride
so
natural
to
all
who
fight
it
was
impetuous
affected
even
forced
he
sought
to
glut
intoxicate
himself
with
strife
and
carnage
he
excited
himself
to
such
a
degree
that
monseigneur
called
to
him
to
stop
he
must
have
heard
the
voice
of
monseigneur
because
we
who
were
close
to
him
heard
it
he
did
not
however
stop
but
continued
his
course
to
the
intrenchments
as
m
de
bragelonne
was
a
welldisciplined
officer
this
disobedience
to
the
orders
of
monseigneur
very
much
surprised
everybody
and
m
de
beaufort
redoubled
his
earnestness
crying
stop
bragelonne
where
are
you
going
stop
repeated
monseigneur
i
command
you
we
all
imitating
the
gesture
of
m
le
duc
we
all
raised
our
hands
we
expected
that
the
cavalier
would
turn
bridle
but
m
de
bragelonne
continued
to
ride
towards
the
palisades
stop
bragelonne
repeated
the
prince
in
a
very
loud
voice
stop
in
the
name
of
your
father
at
these
words
m
de
bragelonne
turned
round
his
countenance
expressed
a
lively
grief
but
he
did
not
stop
we
then
concluded
that
his
horse
must
have
run
away
with
him
when
m
le
duc
saw
cause
to
conclude
that
the
vicomte
was
no
longer
master
of
his
horse
and
had
watched
him
precede
the
first
grenadiers
his
highness
cried
musketeers
kill
his
horse
a
hundred
pistoles
for
the
man
who
kills
his
horse
but
who
could
expect
to
hit
the
beast
without
at
least
wounding
his
rider
no
one
dared
the
attempt
at
length
one
presented
himself
he
was
a
sharpshooter
of
the
regiment
of
picardy
named
luzerne
who
took
aim
at
the
animal
fired
and
hit
him
in
the
quarters
for
we
saw
the
blood
redden
the
hair
of
the
horse
instead
of
falling
the
cursed
jennet
was
irritated
and
carried
him
on
more
furiously
than
ever
every
picard
who
saw
this
unfortunate
young
man
rushing
on
to
meet
certain
death
shouted
in
the
loudest
manner
throw
yourself
off
monsieur
le
vicomteoffoff
throw
yourself
off
m
de
bragelonne
was
an
officer
much
beloved
in
the
army
already
had
the
vicomte
arrived
within
pistolshot
of
the
ramparts
when
a
discharge
was
poured
upon
him
that
enshrouded
him
in
fire
and
smoke
we
lost
sight
of
him
the
smoke
dispersed
he
was
on
foot
upright
his
horse
was
killed
the
vicomte
was
summoned
to
surrender
by
the
arabs
but
he
made
them
a
negative
sign
with
his
head
and
continued
to
march
towards
the
palisades
this
was
a
mortal
imprudence
nevertheless
the
entire
army
was
pleased
that
he
would
not
retreat
since
illchance
had
led
him
so
near
he
marched
a
few
paces
further
and
the
two
regiments
clapped
their
hands
it
was
at
this
moment
the
second
discharge
shook
the
walls
and
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
again
disappeared
in
the
smoke
but
this
time
the
smoke
dispersed
in
vain
we
no
longer
saw
him
standing
he
was
down
with
his
head
lower
than
his
legs
among
the
bushes
and
the
arabs
began
to
think
of
leaving
their
intrenchments
to
come
and
cut
off
his
head
or
take
his
bodyas
is
the
custom
with
the
infidels
but
monseigneur
le
duc
de
beaufort
had
followed
all
this
with
his
eyes
and
the
sad
spectacle
drew
from
him
many
painful
sighs
he
then
cried
aloud
seeing
the
arabs
running
like
white
phantoms
among
the
mastictrees
grenadiers
lancers
will
you
let
them
take
that
noble
body
saying
these
words
and
waving
his
sword
he
himself
rode
towards
the
enemy
the
regiments
rushing
in
his
steps
ran
in
their
turn
uttering
cries
as
terrible
as
those
of
the
arabs
were
wild
the
combat
commenced
over
the
body
of
m
de
bragelonne
and
with
such
inveteracy
was
it
fought
that
a
hundred
and
sixty
arabs
were
left
upon
the
field
by
the
side
of
at
least
fifty
of
our
troops
it
was
a
lieutenant
from
normandy
who
took
the
body
of
the
vicomte
on
his
shoulders
and
carried
it
back
to
the
lines
the
advantage
was
however
pursued
the
regiments
took
the
reserve
with
them
and
the
enemys
palisades
were
utterly
destroyed
at
three
oclock
the
fire
of
the
arabs
ceased
the
handtohand
fight
lasted
two
hours
it
was
a
massacre
at
five
oclock
we
were
victorious
at
all
points
the
enemy
had
abandoned
his
positions
and
m
le
duc
ordered
the
white
flag
to
be
planted
on
the
summit
of
the
little
mountain
it
was
then
we
had
time
to
think
of
m
de
bragelonne
who
had
eight
large
wounds
in
his
body
through
which
almost
all
his
blood
had
welled
away
still
however
he
had
breathed
which
afforded
inexpressible
joy
to
monseigneur
who
insisted
on
being
present
at
the
first
dressing
of
the
wounds
and
the
consultation
of
the
surgeons
there
were
two
among
them
who
declared
m
de
bragelonne
would
live
monseigneur
threw
his
arms
around
their
necks
and
promised
them
a
thousand
louis
each
if
they
could
save
him
the
vicomte
heard
these
transports
of
joy
and
whether
he
was
in
despair
or
whether
he
suffered
much
from
his
wounds
he
expressed
by
his
countenance
a
contradiction
which
gave
rise
to
reflection
particularly
in
one
of
the
secretaries
when
he
had
heard
what
follows
the
third
surgeon
was
the
brother
of
sylvain
de
saintcosme
the
most
learned
of
them
all
he
probed
the
wounds
in
his
turn
and
said
nothing
m
de
bragelonne
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
upon
the
skillful
surgeon
and
seemed
to
interrogate
his
every
movement
the
latter
upon
being
questioned
by
monseigneur
replied
that
he
saw
plainly
three
mortal
wounds
out
of
eight
but
so
strong
was
the
constitution
of
the
wounded
so
rich
was
he
in
youth
and
so
merciful
was
the
goodness
of
god
that
perhaps
m
de
bragelonne
might
recover
particularly
if
he
did
not
move
in
the
slightest
manner
frere
sylvain
added
turning
towards
his
assistants
above
everything
do
not
allow
him
to
move
even
a
finger
or
you
will
kill
him
and
we
all
left
the
tent
in
very
low
spirits
that
secretary
i
have
mentioned
on
leaving
the
tent
thought
he
perceived
a
faint
and
sad
smile
glide
over
the
lips
of
m
de
bragelonne
when
the
duke
said
to
him
in
a
cheerful
kind
voice
we
will
save
you
vicomte
we
will
save
you
yet
in
the
evening
when
it
was
believed
the
wounded
youth
had
taken
some
repose
one
of
the
assistants
entered
his
tent
but
rushed
out
again
immediately
uttering
loud
cries
we
all
ran
up
in
disorder
m
le
duc
with
us
and
the
assistant
pointed
to
the
body
of
m
de
bragelonne
upon
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
bathed
in
the
remainder
of
his
blood
it
appeared
that
he
had
suffered
some
convulsion
some
delirium
and
that
he
had
fallen
that
the
fall
had
accelerated
his
end
according
to
the
prognosis
of
frere
sylvain
we
raised
the
vicomte
he
was
cold
and
dead
he
held
a
lock
of
fair
hair
in
his
right
hand
and
that
hand
was
tightly
pressed
upon
his
heart
then
followed
the
details
of
the
expedition
and
of
the
victory
obtained
over
the
arabs
dartagnan
stopped
at
the
account
of
the
death
of
poor
raoul
oh
murmured
he
unhappy
boy
a
suicide
and
turning
his
eyes
towards
the
chamber
of
the
chateau
in
which
athos
slept
in
eternal
sleep
they
kept
their
words
with
each
other
said

in
a
low
voice
now
i
believe
them
to
be
happy
they
must
be
reunited
and
he
returned
through
the
parterre
with
slow
and
melancholy
steps
all
the
villageall
the
neighborhoodwere
filled
with

neighbors
relating
to

the

the

and
wherever
messengers
had
carried
the
news
might
have
been
seen
arriving
in

dartagnan
had
shut
himself
up
without
being
willing
to
speak
to
anybody
two
such
heavy
deaths
falling
upon
the
captain
so
closely
after
the
death
of
porthos
for
a
long
time
oppressed
that
spirit
which
had
hitherto
been
so
indefatigable
and
invulnerable
except
grimaud
who
entered
his
chamber
once
the
musketeer
saw
neither
servants
nor
guests
he
supposed
from
the
noises
in
the
house
and
the
continual
coming
and
going
that
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
funeral
of
the
comte
he
wrote
to
the
king
to
ask
for
an
extension
of
his
leave
of
absence
grimaud
as
we
have
said
had
entered
dartagnans
apartment
had
seated
himself
upon
a
jointstool
near
the
door
like
a
man
who
meditates
profoundly
then
rising
he
made
a
sign
to
dartagnan
to
follow
him
the
latter
obeyed
in
silence
grimaud
descended
to
the
comtes
bedchamber
showed
the
captain
with
his
finger
the
place
of
the
empty
bed
and
raised
his
eyes
eloquently
towards
heaven
yes
replied
dartagnan
yes
good
grimaudnow
with
the
son
he
loved
so
much
grimaud
left
the
chamber
and
led
the
way
to
the
hall
where
according
to
the
custom
of
the
province
the
body
was
laid
out
previously
to
being
put
away
forever
dartagnan
was
struck
at
seeing
two
open
coffins
in
the
hall
in
reply
to
the
mute
invitation
of
grimaud
he
approached
and
saw
in
one
of
them
athos
still
handsome
in
death
and
in
the
other
raoul
with
his
eyes
closed
his
cheeks
pearly
as
those
of
the
palls
of
virgil
with
a
smile
on
his
violet
lips
he
shuddered
at
seeing
the
father
and
son
those
two
departed
souls
represented
on
earth
by
two
silent
melancholy
bodies
incapable
of
touching
each
other
however
close
they
might
be
raoul
here
murmured
he
oh
grimaud
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
grimaud
shook
his
head
and
made
no
reply
but
taking
dartagnan
by
the
hand
he
led
him
to
the
coffin
and
showed
him
under
the
thin
windingsheet
the
black
wounds
by
which
life
had
escaped
the
captain
turned
away
his
eyes
and
judging
it
was
useless
to
question
grimaud
who
would
not
answer
he
recollected
that
m
de
beauforts
secretary
had
written
more
than
he
dartagnan
had
had
the
courage
to
read
taking
up
the
recital
of
the
affair
which
had
cost
raoul
his
life
he
found
these
words
which
ended
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
letter
monseigneur
le
duc
has
ordered
that
the
body
of
monsieur
le
vicomte
should
be
embalmed
after
the
manner
practiced
by
the
arabs
when
they
wish
their
dead
to
be
carried
to
their
native
land
and
monsieur
le
duc
has
appointed
relays
so
that
the
same
confidential
servant
who
brought
up
the
young
man
might
take
back
his
remains
to
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
and
so
thought
dartagnan
i
shall
follow
thy
funeral
my
dear
boyi
already
oldi
who
am
of
no
value
on
earthand
i
shall
scatter
dust
upon
that
brow
i
kissed
but
two
months
since
god
has
willed
it
to
be
so
thou
hast
willed
it
to
be
so
thyself
i
have
no
longer
the
right
even
to
weep
thou
hast
chosen
death
it
seemed
to
thee
a
preferable
gift
to
life
at
length
arrived
the
moment
when
the
chill
remains
of
these
two
gentlemen
were
to
be
given
back
to
mother
earth
there
was
such
an
affluence
of
military
and
other
people
that
up
to
the
place
of
the
sepulture
which
was
a
little
chapel
on
the
plain
the
road
from
the
city
was
filled
with
horsemen
and
pedestrians
in
mourning
athos
had
chosen
for
his
restingplace
the
little
inclosure
of
a
chapel
erected
by
himself
near
the
boundary
of
his
estates
he
had
had
the
stones
cut
in
1550
brought
from
an
old
gothic
manorhouse
in
berry
which
had
sheltered
his
early
youth
the
chapel
thus
rebuilt
transported
was
pleasing
to
the
eye
beneath
its
leafy
curtains
of
poplars
and
sycamores
it
was
ministered
in
every
sunday
by
the
cure
of
the
neighboring
bourg
to
whom
athos
paid
an
allowance
of
two
hundred
francs
for
this
service
and
all
the
vassals
of
his
domain
with
their
families
came
thither
to
hear
mass
without
having
any
occasion
to
go
to
the
city
behind
the
chapel
extended
surrounded
by
two
high
hedges
of
hazel
elder
and
white
thorn
and
a
deep
ditch
the
little
inclosureuncultivated
though
gay
in
its
sterility
because
the
mosses
there
grew
thick
wild
heliotrope
and
ravenelles
there
mingled
perfumes
while
from
beneath
an
ancient
chestnut
issued
a
crystal
spring
a
prisoner
in
its
marble
cistern
and
on
the
thyme
all
around
alighted
thousands
of
bees
from
the
neighboring
plants
whilst
chaffinches
and
redthroats
sang
cheerfully
among
the
flowerspangled
hedges
it
was
to
this
place
the
somber
coffins
were
carried
attended
by
a
silent
and
respectful
crowd
the
office
of
the
dead
being
celebrated
the
last
adieux
paid
to
the
noble
departed
the
assembly
dispersed
talking
along
the
roads
of
the
virtues
and
mild
death
of
the
father
of
the
hopes
the
son
had
given
and
of
his
melancholy
end
upon
the
arid
coast
of
africa
little
by
little
all
noises
were
extinguished
like
the
lamps
illuminating
the
humble
nave
the
minister
bowed
for
the
last
time
to
the
altar
and
the
still
fresh
graves
then
followed
by
his
assistant
he
slowly
took
the
road
back
to
the
presbytery
dartagnan
left
alone
perceived
that
night
was
coming
on
he
had
forgotten
the
hour
thinking
only
of
the
dead
he
arose
from
the
oaken
bench
on
which
he
was
seated
in
the
chapel
and
wished
as
the
priest
had
done
to
go
and
bid
a
last
adieu
to
the
double
grave
which
contained
his
two
lost
friends
a
woman
was
praying
kneeling
on
the
moist
earth
dartagnan
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
to
avoid
disturbing
her
and
also
to
endeavor
to
find
out
who
was
the
pious
friend
who
performed
this
sacred
duty
with
so
much
zeal
and
perseverance
the
unknown
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands
which
were
white
as
alabaster
from
the
noble
simplicity
of
her
costume
she
must
be
a
woman
of
distinction
outside
the
inclosure
were
several
horses
mounted
by
servants
a
travelling
carriage
was
in
waiting
for
this
lady
dartagnan
in
vain
sought
to
make
out
what
caused
her
delay
she
continued
praying
and
frequently
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
by
which
dartagnan
perceived
she
was
weeping
he
beheld
her
strike
her
breast
with
the
compunction
of
a
christian
woman
he
heard
her
several
times
exclaim
as
from
a
wounded
heart
pardon
pardon
and
as
she
appeared
to
abandon
herself
entirely
to
her
grief
as
she
threw
herself
down
almost
fainting
exhausted
by
complaints
and
prayers
dartagnan
touched
by
this
love
for
his
so
much
regretted
friends
made
a
few
steps
towards
the
grave
in
order
to
interrupt
the
melancholy
colloquy
of
the
penitent
with
the
dead
but
as
soon
as
his
step
sounded
on
the
gravel
the
unknown
raised
her
head
revealing
to
dartagnan
a
face
aflood
with
tears
a
wellknown
face
it
was
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
monsieur
dartagnan
murmured
she
you
replied
the
captain
in
a
stern
voice
you
hereoh
madame
i
should
better
have
liked
to
see
you
decked
with
flowers
in
the

it

pitiless
friend

men

grave
oh
spare
me
god
forbid
madame
that
i
should
offend
a
woman
or
that
i
should
make
her
weep
in
vain
but
i
must
say
that
the
place
of
the
murderer
is
not
upon
the
grave
of
her
victims
she
wished
to
reply
what
i
now
tell
you
added
he
coldly
i
have
already
told
the
king
she
clasped
her
hands
i
know
said
she
i
have
caused
the
death
of
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
ah
you
know
it
the
news
arrived
at
court
yesterday
i
have
traveled
during
the
night
forty
leagues
to
come
and
ask
pardon
of
the
comte
whom
i
supposed
to
be
still
living
and
to
pray
god
on
the
tomb
of
raoul
that
he
would
send
me
all
the
misfortunes
i
have
merited
except
a
single
one
now
monsieur
i
know
that
the
death
of
the
son
has
killed
the
father
i
have
two
crimes
to
reproach
myself
with
i
have
two
punishments
to
expect
from
heaven
i
will
repeat
to
you
mademoiselle
said
dartagnan
what
m
de
bragelonne
said
of
you
at
antibes
when
he
already
meditated
death
if
pride
and
coquetry
have
misled
her
i
pardon
her
while
despising
her
if
love
has
produced
her
error
i
pardon
her
but
i
swear
that
no
one
could
have
loved
her
as
i
have
done
you
know
interrupted
louise
that
of
my
love
i
was
about
to
sacrifice
myself
you
know
whether
i
suffered
when
you
met
me
lost
dying
abandoned
well
never
have
i
suffered
so
much
as
now
because
then
i
hoped
desirednow
i
have
no
longer
anything
to
wish
for
because
this
death
drags
all
my
joy
into
the
tomb
because
i
can
no
longer
dare
to
love
without
remorse
and
i
feel
that
he
whom
i
loveoh
it
is
but
justwill
repay
me
with
the
tortures
i
have
made
others
undergo
dartagnan
made
no
reply
he
was
too
well
convinced
that
she
was
not
mistaken
well
then
added
she
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
do
not
overwhelm
me
today
i
again
implore
you
i
am
like
the
branch
torn
from
the
trunk
i
no
longer
hold
to
anything
in
this
worlda
current
drags
me
on
i
know
not
whither
i
love
madly
even
to
the
point
of
coming
to
tell
it
wretch
that
i
am
over
the
ashes
of
the
dead
and
i
do
not
blush
for
iti
have
no
remorse
on
this
account
such
love
is
a
religion
only
as
hereafter
you
will
see
me
alone
forgotten
disdained
as
you
will
see
me
punished
as
i
am
destined
to
be
punished
spare
me
in
my
ephemeral
happiness
leave
it
to
me
for
a
few
days
for
a
few
minutes
now
even
at
the
moment
i
am
speaking
to
you
perhaps
it
no
longer
exists
my
god
this
double
murder
is
perhaps
already
expiated
while
she
was
speaking
thus
the
sound
of
voices
and
of
horses
drew
the
attention
of
the
captain
m
de
saintaignan
came
to
seek
la
valliere
the
king
he
said
is
a
prey
to
jealousy
and
uneasiness
saintaignan
did
not
perceive
dartagnan
half
concealed
by
the
trunk
of
a
chestnuttree
which
shaded
the
double
grave
louise
thanked
saintaignan
and
dismissed
him
with
a
gesture
he
rejoined
the
party
outside
the
inclosure
you
see
madame
said
the
captain
bitterly
to
the
young
womanyou
see
your
happiness
still
lasts
the
young
woman
raised
her
head
with
a
solemn
air
a
day
will
come
said
she
when
you
will
repent
of
having
so
misjudged
me
on
that
day
it
is
i
who
will
pray
god
to
forgive
you
for
having
been
unjust
towards
me
besides
i
shall
suffer
so
much
that
you
yourself
will
be
the
first
to
pity
my
sufferings
do
not
reproach
me
with
my
fleeting
happiness
monsieur
dartagnan
it
costs
me
dear
and
i
have
not
paid
all
my
debt
saying
these
words
she
again
knelt
down
softly
and
affectionately
pardon
me
the
last
time
my
affianced
raoul
said
she
i
have
broken
our
chain
we
are
both
destined
to
die
of
grief
it
is
thou
who
departest
first
fear
nothing
i
shall
follow
thee
see
only
that
i
have
not
been
base
and
that
i
have
come
to
bid
thee
this
last
adieu
the
lord
is
my
witness
raoul
that
if
with
my
life
i
could
have
redeemed
thine
i
would
have
given
that
life
without
hesitation
i
could
not
give
my
love
once
more
forgive
me
dearest
kindest
friend
she
strewed
a
few
sweet
flowers
on
the
freshly
sodded
earth
then
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
the
heavily
stricken
lady
bowed
to
dartagnan
and
disappeared
the
captain
watched
the
departure
of
the
horses
horsemen
and
carriage
then
crossing
his
arms
upon
his
swelling
chest
when
will
it
be
my
turn
to
depart
said
he
in
an
agitated
voice
what
is
there
left
for
man
after
youth
love
glory

more
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
with
a
dull
eye
then
drawing
himself
up
forward
still
forward
said
he
when
it
is

epilogue
four
years
after
the
scene
we
have
just
described
two
horsemen
well
mounted
traversed
blois
early
in
the
morning
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
a
hawking
party
the
king
had
arranged
to
make
in
that
uneven
plain
the
loire
divides
in
two
which
borders
on
the
one
side
meung
on
the
other
amboise
these
were
the
keeper
of
the
kings
harriers
and
the
master
of
the
falcons
personages
greatly
respected
in
the
time
of
louis
xiii
but
rather
neglected
by
his
successor
the
horsemen
having
reconnoitered
the
ground
were
returning
their
observations
made
when
they
perceived
certain
little
groups
of
soldiers
here
and
there
whom
the
sergeants
were
placing
at
distances
at
the
openings
of
the
inclosures
these
were
the
kings
musketeers
behind
them
came
upon
a
splendid
horse
the
captain
known
by
his
richly
embroidered
uniform
his
hair
was
gray
his
beard
turning
so
he
seemed
a
little
bent
although
sitting
and
handling
his
horse
gracefully
he
was
looking
about
him
watchfully
m
dartagnan
does
not
get
any
older
said
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
to
his
colleague
the
falconer
with
ten
years
more
to
carry
than
either
of
us
he
has
the
seat
of
a
young
man
on
horseback
that
is
true
replied
the
falconer
i
dont
see
any
change
in
him
for
the
last
twenty
years
but
this
officer
was
mistaken
dartagnan
in
the
last
four
years
had
lived
a
dozen
age
had
printed
its
pitiless
claws
at
each
angle
of
his
eyes
his
brow
was
bald
his
hands
formerly
brown
and
nervous
were
getting
white
as
if
the
blood
had
half
forgotten
them
dartagnan
accosted
the
officers
with
the
shade
of
affability
which
distinguishes
superiors
and
received
in
turn
for
his
courtesy
two
most
respectful
bows
ah
what
a
lucky
chance
to
see
you
here
monsieur
dartagnan
cried
the
falconer
it
is
rather
i
who
should
say
that
messieurs
replied
the
captain
for
nowadays
the
king
makes
more
frequent
use
of
his
musketeers
than
of
his
falcons
ah
it
is
not
as
it
was
in
the
good
old
times
sighed
the
falconer
do
you
remember
monsieur
dartagnan
when
the
late
king
flew
the
pie
in
the
vineyards
beyond
beaugence
ah
dame
you
were
not
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
at
that
time
monsieur
dartagnan
7
and
you
were
nothing
but
undercorporal
of
the
tiercelets
replied
dartagnan
laughing
never
mind
that
it
was
a
good
time
seeing
that
it
is
always
a
good
time
when
we
are
young
good
day
monsieur
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
you
do
me
honor
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
latter
dartagnan
made
no
reply
the
title
of
comte
had
hardly
struck
him
dartagnan
had
been
a
comte
four
years
are
you
not
very
much
fatigued
with
the
long
journey
you
have
taken
monsieur
le
capitaine
continued
the
falconer
it
must
be
full
two
hundred
leagues
from
hence
to
pignerol
two
hundred
and
sixty
to
go
and
as
many
to
return
said
dartagnan
quietly
and
said
the
falconer
is
he
well
who
asked
dartagnan
why
poor
m
fouquet
continued
the
falconer
in
a
low
voice
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
had
prudently
withdrawn
no
replied
dartagnan
the
poor
man
frets
terribly
he
cannot
comprehend
how
imprisonment
can
be
a
favor
he
says
that
parliament
absolved
him
by
banishing
him
and
banishment
is
or
should
be
liberty
he
cannot
imagine
that
they
had
sworn
his
death
and
that
to
save
his
life
from
the
claws
of
parliament
was
to
be
under
too
much
obligation
to
heaven
ah
yes
the
poor
man
had
a
close
chance
of
the
scaffold
replied
the
falconer
it
is
said
that
m
colbert
had
given
orders
to
the
governor
of
the
bastile
and
that
the
execution
was
ordered
enough
said
dartagnan
pensively
and
with
a
view
of
cutting
short
the
conversation
yes
said
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
drawing
towards
them
m
fouquet
is
now
at
pignerol
he
has
richly
deserved
it
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
conducted
there
by
you
he
robbed
the
king
sufficiently
dartagnan
launched
at
the
master
of
the
dogs
one
of
his
crossest
looks
and
said
to
him
monsieur
if
any
one
told
me
you
had
eaten
your
dogs
meat
not
only
would
i
refuse
to
believe
it
but
still
more
if
you
were
condemned
to
the
lash
or
to
jail
for
it
i
should
pity
you
and
would
not
allow
people
to
speak
ill
of
you
and
yet
monsieur
honest
man
as
you
may
be
i
assure
you
that
you
are
not
more
so
than
poor
m
fouquet
was
after
having
undergone
this
sharp
rebuke
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
hung
his
head
and
allowed
the
falconer
to
get
two
steps
in
advance
of
him
nearer
to
dartagnan
he
is
content
said
the
falconer
in
a
low
voice
to
the
musketeer
we
all
know
that
harriers
are
in
fashion
nowadays
if
he
were
a
falconer
he
would
not
talk
in
that
way
dartagnan
smiled
in
a
melancholy
manner
at
seeing
this
great
political
question
resolved
by
the
discontent
of
such
humble
interest
he
for
a
moment
ran
over
in
his
mind
the
glorious
existence
of
the
surintendant
the
crumbling
of
his
fortunes
and
the
melancholy
death
that
awaited
him
and
to
conclude
did
m
fouquet
love
falconry
said
he
oh
passionately
monsieur
repeated
the
falconer
with
an
accent
of
bitter
regret
and
a
sigh
that
was
the
funeral
oration
of
fouquet
dartagnan
allowed
the
illhumor
of
the
one
and
the
regret
of
the
other
to
pass
and
continued
to
advance
they
could
already
catch
glimpses
of
the
huntsmen
at
the
issue
of
the
wood
the
feathers
of
the
outriders
passing
like
shooting
stars
across
the
clearings
and
the
white
horses
skirting
the
bosky
thickets
looking
like
illuminated
apparitions
but
resumed
dartagnan
will
the
sport
last
long
pray
give
us
a
good
swift
bird
for
i
am
very
tired
is
it
a
heron
or
a
swan
both
monsieur
dartagnan
said
the
falconer
but
you
need
not
be
alarmed
the
king
is
not
much
of
a
sportsman
he
does
not
take
the
field
on
his
own
account
he
only
wishes
to
amuse
the
ladies
the
words
to
amuse
the
ladies
were
so
strongly
accented
they
set
dartagnan
thinking
ah
said
he
looking
keenly
at
the
falconer
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
smiled
no
doubt
with
a
view
of
making
it
up
with
the
musketeer
oh
you
may
safely
laugh
said
dartagnan
i
know
nothing
of
current
news
i
only
arrived
yesterday
after
a
months
absence
i
left
the
court
mourning
the
death
of
the
queenmother
the
king
was
not
willing
to
take
any
amusement
after
receiving
the
last
sigh
of
anne
of
austria
but
everything
comes
to
an
end
in
this
world
well
then
he
is
no
longer
sad
so
much
the
better
8
and
everything
begins
as
well
as
ends
said
the
keeper
with
a
coarse
laugh
ah
said
dartagnan
a
second
timehe
burned
to
know
but
dignity
would
not
allow
him
to
interrogate
people
below
himthere
is
something
beginning
then
it
seems
the
keeper
gave
him
a
significant
wink
but
dartagnan
was
unwilling
to
learn
anything
from
this
man
shall
we
see
the
king
early
asked
he
of
the
falconer
at
seven
oclock
monsieur
i
shall
fly
the
birds
who
comes
with
the
king
how
is
madame
how
is
the
queen
better
monsieur
has
she
been
ill
then
monsieur
since
the
last
chagrin
she
suffered
her
majesty
has
been
unwell
what
chagrin
you
need
not
fancy
your
news
is
old
i
have
but
just
returned
it
appears
that
the
queen
a
little
neglected
since
the
death
of
her
motherinlaw
complained
to
the
king
who
answered
herdo
i
not
sleep
at
home
every
night
madame
what
more
do
you
expect
ah
said
dartagnanpoor
woman
she
must
heartily
hate
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
oh
no
not
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
replied
the
falconer
who
then
the
blast
of
a
huntinghorn
interrupted
this
conversation
it
summoned
the
dogs
and
the
hawks
the
falconer
and
his
companions
set
off
immediately
leaving
dartagnan
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
suspended
sentence
the
king
appeared
at
a
distance
surrounded
by
ladies
and
horsemen
all
the
troop
advanced
in
beautiful
order
at
a
foots
pace
the
horns
of
various
sorts
animating
the
dogs
and
horses
there
was
an
animation
in
the
scene
a
mirage
of
light
of
which
nothing
now
can
give
an
idea
unless
it
be
the
fictitious
splendor
of
a
theatric
spectacle
dartagnan
with
an
eye
a
little
just
a
little
dimmed
by
age
distinguished
behind
the
group
three
carriages
the
first
was
intended
for
the
queen
it
was
empty
dartagnan
who
did
not
see
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
by
the
kings
side
on
looking
about
for
her
saw
her
in
the
second
carriage
she
was
alone
with
two
of
her
women
who
seemed
as
dull
as
their
mistress
on
the
left
hand
of
the
king
upon
a
highspirited
horse
restrained
by
a
bold
and
skillful
hand
shone
a
lady
of
most
dazzling
beauty
the
king
smiled
upon
her
and
she
smiled
upon
the
king
loud
laughter
followed
every
word
she
uttered
i
must
know
that
woman
thought
the
musketeer
who
can
she
be
and
he
stooped
towards
his
friend
the
falconer
to
whom
he
addressed
the
question
he
had
put
to
himself
the
falconer
was
about
to
reply
when
the
king
perceiving
dartagnan
ah
comte
said
he
you
are
amongst
us
once
more
then
why
have
i
not
seen
you
sire
replied
the
captain
because
your
majesty
was
asleep
when
i
arrived
and
not
awake
when
i
resumed
my
duties
this
morning
still
the
same
said
louis
in
a
loud
voice
denoting
satisfaction
take
some
rest
comte
i
command
you
to
do
so
you
will
dine
with
me
today
a
murmur
of
admiration
surrounded
dartagnan
like
a
caress
every
one
was
eager
to
salute
him
dining
with
the
king
was
an
honor
his
majesty
was
not
so
prodigal
of
as
henry
iv
had
been
the
king
passed
a
few
steps
in
advance
and
dartagnan
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
fresh
group
among
whom
shone
colbert
goodday
monsieur
dartagnan
said
the
minister
with
marked
affability
have
you
had
a
pleasant
journey
yes
monsieur
said
dartagnan
bowing
to
the
neck
of
his
horse
i
heard
the
king
invite
you
to
his
table
for
this
evening
continued
the
minister
you
will
meet
an
old
friend
there
an
old
friend
of
mine
asked
dartagnan
plunging
painfully
into
the
dark
waves
of
the
past
which
had
swallowed
up
for
him
so
many
friendships
and
so
many
hatreds
m
le
duc
dalmeda
who
is
arrived
this
morning
from
spain
the
duc
dalmeda
said
dartagnan
reflecting
in
vain
here
cried
an
old
man
white
as
snow
sitting
bent
in
his
carriage
which
he
caused
to
be
thrown
open
to
make
room
for
the
musketeer
aramis
cried
dartagnan
struck
with
profound
amazement
and
he
felt
inert
as
it
was
the
thin
arm
of
the
old
nobleman
hanging
round
his
neck
colbert
after
having
observed
them
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
urged
his
horse
forward
and
left
the
two
old
friends
together
and
so
said
the
musketeer
taking
aramiss
arm
you
the
exile
the
rebel
are
again
in
france
ah
and
i
shall
dine
with
you
at
the
kings
table
said
aramis
smiling
yes
will
you
not
ask
yourself
what
is
the
use
of
fidelity
in
this
world
stop
let
us
allow
poor
la
vallieres
carriage
to
pass
look
how
uneasy
she
is
how
her
eyes
dim
with
tears
follow
the
king
who
is
riding
on
horseback
yonder
with
whom
with
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
now
madame
de
montespan
replied
aramis
she
is
jealous
is
she
then
deserted
not
quite
yet
but
it
will
not
be
long
before
she
is
9
they
chatted
together
while
following
the
sport
and
aramiss
coachman
drove
them
so
cleverly
that
they
arrived
at
the
instant
when
the
falcon
attacking
the
bird
beat
him
down
and
fell
upon
him
the
king
alighted
madame
de
montespan
followed
his
example
they
were
in
front
of
an
isolated
chapel
concealed
by
huge
trees
already
despoiled
of
their
leaves
by
the
first
cutting
winds
of
autumn
behind
this
chapel
was
an
inclosure
closed
by
a
latticed
gate
the
falcon
had
beaten
down
his
prey
in
the
inclosure
belonging
to
this
little
chapel
and
the
king
was
desirous
of
going
in
to
take
the
first
feather
according
to
custom
the
cortege
formed
a
circle
round
the
building
and
the
hedges
too
small
to
receive
so
many
dartagnan
held
back
aramis
by
the
arm
as
he
was
about
like
the
rest
to
alight
from
his
carriage
and
in
a
hoarse
broken
voice
do
you
know
aramis
said
he
whither
chance
has
conducted
us
no
replied
the
duke
here
repose
men
that
we
knew
well
said
dartagnan
greatly
agitated
aramis
without
divining
anything
and
with
a
trembling
step
penetrated
into
the
chapel
by
a
little
door
which
dartagnan
opened
for
him
where
are
they
buried
said
he
there
in
the
inclosure
there
is
a
cross
you
see
beneath
yon
little
cypress
the
tree
of
grief
is
planted
over
their
tomb
dont
go
to
it
the
king
is
going
that
way
the
heron
has
fallen
just
there
aramis
stopped
and
concealed
himself
in
the
shade
they
then
saw
without
being
seen
the
pale
face
of
la
valliere
who
neglected
in
her
carriage
at
first
looked
on
with
a
melancholy
heart
from
the
door
and
then
carried
away
by
jealousy
advanced
into
the
chapel
whence
leaning
against
a
pillar
she
contemplated
the
king
smiling
and
making
signs
to
madame
de
montespan
to
approach
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
madame
de
montespan
complied
she
took
the
hand
the
king
held
out
to
her
and
he
plucking
out
the
first
feather
from
the
heron
which
the
falconer
had
strangled
placed
it
in
his
beautiful
companions
hat
she
smiling
in
her
turn
kissed
the
hand
tenderly
which
made
her
this
present
the
king
grew
scarlet
with
vanity
and
pleasure
he
looked
at
madame
de
montespan
with
all
the
fire
of
new
love
what
will
you
give
me
in
exchange
said
he
she
broke
off
a
little
branch
of
cypress
and
offered
it
to
the
king
who
looked
intoxicated
with
hope
humph
said
aramis
to
dartagnan
the
present
is
but
a
sad
one
for
that
cypress
shades
a
tomb
yes
and
the
tomb
is
that
of
raoul
de
bragelonne
said
dartagnan
aloud
of
raoul
who
sleeps
under
that
cross
with
his
father
a
groan
resoundedthey
saw
a
woman
fall
fainting
to
the
ground
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
seen
all
heard
all
poor
woman
muttered
dartagnan
as
he
helped
the
attendants
to
carry
back
to
her
carriage
the
lonely
lady
whose
lot
henceforth
in
life
was
suffering
that
evening
dartagnan
was
seated
at
the
kings
table
near
m
colbert
and
m
le
duc
dalmeda
the
king
was
very
gay
he
paid
a
thousand
little
attentions
to
the
queen
a
thousand
kindnesses
to
madame
seated
at
his
left
hand
and
very
sad
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
time
of
calm
when
the
king
was
wont
to
watch
his
mothers
eyes
for
the
approval
or
disapproval
of
what
he
had
just
done
of
mistresses
there
was
no
question
at
this
dinner
the
king
addressed
aramis
two
or
three
times
calling
him
m
lambassadeur
which
increased
the
surprise
already
felt
by
dartagnan
at
seeing
his
friend
the
rebel
so
marvelously
well
received
at
court
the
king
on
rising
from
table
gave
his
hand
to
the
queen
and
made
a
sign
to
colbert
whose
eye
was
on
his
masters
face
colbert
took
dartagnan
and
aramis
on
one
side
the
king
began
to
chat
with
his
sister
whilst
monsieur
very
uneasy
entertained
the
queen
with
a
preoccupied
air
without
ceasing
to
watch
his
wife
and
brother
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
conversation
between
aramis
dartagnan
and
colbert
turned
upon
indifferent
subjects
they
spoke
of
preceding
ministers
colbert
related
the
successful
tricks
of
mazarin
and
desired
those
of
richelieu
to
be
related
to
him
dartagnan
could
not
overcome
his
surprise
at
finding
this
man
with
his
heavy
eyebrows
and
low
forehead
display
so
much
sound
knowledge
and
cheerful
spirits
aramis
was
astonished
at
that
lightness
of
character
which
permitted
this
serious
man
to
retard
with
advantage
the
moment
for
more
important
conversation
to
which
nobody
made
any
allusion
although
all
three
interlocutors
felt
its
imminence
it
was
very
plain
from
the
embarrassed
appearance
of
monsieur
how
much
the
conversation
of
the
king
and
madame
annoyed
him
madames
eyes
were
almost
red
was
she
going
to
complain
was
she
going
to
expose
a
little
scandal
in
open
court
the
king
took
her
on
one
side
and
in
a
tone
so
tender
that
it
must
have
reminded
the
princess
of
the
time
when
she
was
loved
for
herself
sister
said
he
why
do
i
see
tears
in
those
lovely
eyes
whysire
said
she
monsieur
is
jealous
is
he
not
sister
she
looked
towards
monsieur
an
infallible
sign
that
they
were
talking
about
him
yes
said
she
listen
to
me
said
the
king
if
your
friends
compromise
you
it
is
not
monsieurs
fault
he
spoke
these
words
with
so
much
kindness
that
madame
encouraged
having
borne
so
many
solitary
griefs
so
long
was
nearly
bursting
into
tears
so
full
was
her
heart
come
come
dear
little
sister
said
the
king
tell
me
your
griefs
on
the
word
of
a
brother
i
pity
them
on
the
word
of
a
king
i
will
put
an
end
to
them
she
raised
her
glorious
eyes
and
in
a
melancholy
tone
it
is
not
my
friends
who
compromise
me
said
she
they
are
either
absent
or
concealed
they
have
been
brought
into
disgrace
with
your
majesty
they
so
devoted
so
good
so
loyal
you
say
this
on
account
of
de
guiche
whom
i
have
exiled
at
monsieurs
desire
and
who
since
that
unjust
exile
has
endeavored
to
get
himself
killed
once
every
day
unjust
say
you
sister
so
unjust
that
if
i
had
not
had
the
respect
mixed
with
friendship
that
i
have
always
entertained
for
your
majesty
well
well
i
would
have
asked
my
brother
charles
upon
whom
i
can
always
the
king
started
what
then
i
would
have
asked
him
to
have
had
it
represented
to
you
that
monsieur
and
his
favorite
m
le
chevalier
de
lorraine
ought
not
with
impunity
to
constitute
themselves
the
executioners
of
my
honor
and
my
happiness
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
said
the
king
that
dismal
fellow
is
my
mortal
enemy
whilst
that
man
lives
in
my
household
where
monsieur
retains
him
and
delegates
his
power
to
him
i
shall
be
the
most
miserable
woman
in
the
kingdom
so
said
the
king
slowly
you
call
your
brother
of
england
a
better
friend
than
i
am
actions
speak
for
themselves
sire
and
you
would
prefer
going
to
ask
assistance
there
to
my
own
country
said
she
with
pride
yes
sire
you
are
the
grandchild
of
henry
iv
as
well
as
myself
lady
cousin
and
brotherinlaw
does
not
that
amount
pretty
well
to
the
title
of
brothergermain
then
said
henrietta
act
let
us
form
an
alliance
begin
i
have
you
say
unjustly
exiled
de
guiche
oh
yes
said
she
blushing
de
guiche
shall
return
10
so
far
well
and
now
you
say
that
i
do
wrong
in
having
in
your
household
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
who
gives
monsieur
ill
advice
respecting
you
remember
well
what
i
tell
you
sire
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
some
dayobserve
if
ever
i
come
to
a
dreadful
end
i
beforehand
accuse
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
he
has
a
spirit
that
is
capable
of
any
crime
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
shall
no
longer
annoy
youi
promise
you
that
11
then
that
will
be
a
true
preliminary
of
alliance
sirei
sign
but
since
you
have
done
your
part
tell
me
what
shall
be
mine
instead
of
embroiling
me
with
your
brother
charles
you
must
make
him
a
more
intimate
friend
than
ever
that
is
very
easy
oh
not
quite
so
easy
as
you
may
suppose
for
in
ordinary
friendship
people
embrace
or
exercise
hospitality
and
that
only
costs
a
kiss
or
a
return
profitable
expenses
but
in
political
friendship
ah
its
a
political
friendship
is
it
yes
my
sister
and
then
instead
of
embraces
and
feasts
it
is
soldiersit
is
soldiers
all
alive
and
well
equippedthat
we
must
serve
up
to
our
friends
vessels
we
must
offer
all
armed
with
cannons
and
stored
with
provisions
it
hence
results
that
we
have
not
always
coffers
in
a
fit
condition
for
such
friendships
ah
you
are
quite
right
said
madame
the
coffers
of
the
king
of
england
have
been
sonorous
for
some
time
but
you
my
sister
who
have
so
much
influence
over
your
brother
you
can
secure
more
than
an
ambassador
could
ever
get
the
promise
of
to
effect
that
i
must
go
to
london
my
dear
brother
i
have
thought
so
replied
the
king
eagerly
and
i
have
said
to
myself
that
such
a
voyage
would
do
your
health
and
spirits
good
only
interrupted
madame
it
is
possible
i
should
fail
the
king
of
england
has
dangerous
counselors
counselors
do
you
say
precisely
if
by
chance
your
majesty
had
any
intentioni
am
only
supposing
soof
asking
charles
ii
his
alliance
in
a
war
a
war
yes
well
then
the
kings
counselors
who
are
in
number
sevenmademoiselle
stewart
mademoiselle
wells
mademoiselle
gwyn
miss
orchay
mademoiselle
zunga
miss
davies
and
the
proud
countess
of
castlemainewill
represent
to
the
king
that
war
costs
a
great
deal
of
money
that
it
is
better
to
give
balls
and
suppers
at
hampton
court
than
to
equip
ships
of
the
line
at
portsmouth
and
greenwich
and
then
your
negotiations
will
fail
oh
those
ladies
cause
all
negotiations
to
fall
through
which
they
dont
make
themselves
do
you
know
the
idea
that
has
struck
me
sister
no
inform
me
what
it
is
it
is
that
searching
well
around
you
you
might
perhaps
find
a
female
counselor
to
take
with
you
to
your
brother
whose
eloquence
might
paralyze
the
illwill
of
the
seven
others
that
is
really
an
idea
sire
and
i
will
search
you
will
find
what
you
want
i
hope
so
a
pretty
ambassadress
is
necessary
an
agreeable
face
is
better
than
an
ugly
one
is
it
not
most
assuredly
an
animated
lively
audacious
character
certainly
nobility
that
is
enough
to
enable
her
to
approach
the
king
without
awkwardnessnot
too
lofty
so
as
not
to
trouble
herself
about
the
dignity
of
her
race
very
true
and
who
knows
a
little
english
mon
dieu
why
some
one
cried
madame
like
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
for
instance
oh
why
yes
said
louis
xiv
you
have
hit
the
markit
is
you
who
have
found
my
sister
i
will
take
her
she
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
i
suppose
oh
no
i
will
name
her
seductrice
plenipotentiaire
at
once
and
will
add
a
dowry
to
the
title
that
is
well
i
fancy
you
already
on
your
road
my
dear
little
sister
consoled
for
all
your
griefs
i
will
go
on
two
conditions
the
first
is
that
i
shall
know
what
i
am
negotiating
about
that
is
it
the
dutch
you
know
insult
me
daily
in
their
gazettes
and
by
their
republican
attitude
i
do
not
like
republics
that
may
easily
be
imagined
sire
i
see
with
pain
that
these
kings
of
the
seathey
call
themselves
sokeep
trade
from
france
in
the
indies
and
that
their
vessels
will
soon
occupy
all
the
ports
of
europe
such
a
power
is
too
near
me
sister
they
are
your
allies
nevertheless
that
is
why
they
were
wrong
in
having
the
medal
you
have
heard
of
struck
a
medal
which
represents
holland
stopping
the
sun
as
joshua
did
with
this
legend
the
sun
had
stopped
before
me
there
is
not
much
fraternity
in
that
is
there
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
that
miserable
episode
i
never
forget
anything
sister
and
if
my
true
friends
such
as
your
brother
charles
are
willing
to
second
me
the
princess
remained
pensively
silent
listen
to
me
there
is
the
empire
of
the
seas
to
be
shared
said
louis
xiv
for
this
partition
which
england
submits
to
could
i
not
represent
the
second
party
as
well
as
the
dutch
we
have
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
to
treat
that
question
replied
madame
your
second
condition
for
going
if
you
please
sister
the
consent
of
monsieur
my
husband
you
shall
have
it
then
consider
me
already
gone
brother
on
hearing
these
words
louis
xiv
turned
round
towards
the
corner
of
the
room
in
which
dartagnan
colbert
and
aramis
stood
and
made
an
affirmative
sign
to
his
minister
colbert
then
broke
in
on
the
conversation
suddenly
and
said
to
aramis
monsieur
lambassadeur
shall
we
talk
about
business
dartagnan
immediately
withdrew
from
politeness
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
fireplace
within
hearing
of
what
the
king
was
about
to
say
to
monsieur
who
evidently
uneasy
had
gone
to
him
the
face
of
the
king
was
animated
upon
his
brow
was
stamped
a
strength
of
will
the
expression
of
which
already
met
no
further
contradiction
in
france
and
was
soon
to
meet
no
more
in
europe
monsieur
said
the
king
to
his
brother
i
am
not
pleased
with
m
le
chevalier
de
lorraine
you
who
do
him
the
honor
to
protect
him
must
advise
him
to
travel
for
a
few
months
these
words
fell
with
the
crush
of
an
avalanche
upon
monsieur
who
adored
his
favorite
and
concentrated
all
his
affections
in
him
in
what
has
the
chevalier
been
inconsiderate
enough
to
displease
your
majesty
cried
he
darting
a
furious
look
at
madame
i
will
tell
you
that
when
he
is
gone
said
the
king
suavely
and
also
when
madame
here
shall
have
crossed
over
into
england
madame
in
england
murmured
monsieur
in
amazement
in
a
week
brother
continued
the
king
whilst
we
will
go
whither
i
will
shortly
tell
you
and
the
king
turned
on
his
heel
smiling
in
his
brothers
face
to
sweeten
as
it
were
the
bitter
draught
he
had
given
him
during
this
time
colbert
was
talking
with
the
duc
dalmeda
monsieur
said
colbert
to
aramis
this
is
the
moment
for
us
to
come
to
an
understanding
i
have
made
your
peace
with
the
king
and
i
owed
that
clearly
to
a
man
of
so
much
merit
but
as
you
have
often
expressed
friendship
for
me
an
opportunity
presents
itself
for
giving
me
a
proof
of
it
you
are
besides
more
a
frenchman
than
a
spaniard
shall
we
secureanswer
me
franklythe
neutrality
of
spain
if
we
undertake
anything
against
the
united
provinces
monsieur
replied
aramis
the
interest
of
spain
is
clear
to
embroil
europe
with
the
provinces
would
doubtless
be
our
policy
but
the
king
of
france
is
an
ally
of
the
united
provinces
you
are
not
ignorant
besides
that
it
would
infer
a
maritime
war
and
that
france
is
in
no
state
to
undertake
this
with
advantage
colbert
turning
round
at
this
moment
saw
dartagnan
who
was
seeking
some
interlocutor
during
this
aside
of
the
king
and
monsieur
he
called
him
at
the
same
time
saying
in
a
low
voice
to
aramis
we
may
talk
openly
with
dartagnan
i
suppose
oh
certainly
replied
the
ambassador
we
were
saying
m
dalmeda
and
i
said
colbert
that
a
conflict
with
the
united
provinces
would
mean
a
maritime
war
thats
evident
enough
replied
the
musketeer
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
monsieur
dartagnan
i
think
that
to
carry
on
such
a
war
successfully
you
must
have
very
large
land
forces
what
did
you
say
said
colbert
thinking
he
had
ill
understood
him
why
such
a
large
land
army
said
aramis
because
the
king
will
be
beaten
by
sea
if
he
has
not
the
english
with
him
and
that
when
beaten
by
sea
he
will
soon
be
invaded
either
by
the
dutch
in
his
ports
or
by
the
spaniards
by
land
and
spain
neutral
asked
aramis
neutral
as
long
as
the
king
shall
prove
stronger
rejoined
dartagnan
colbert
admired
that
sagacity
which
never
touched
a
question
without
enlightening
it
thoroughly
aramis
smiled
as
he
had
long
known
that
in
diplomacy
dartagnan
acknowledged
no
superior
colbert
who
like
all
proud
men
dwelt
upon
his
fantasy
with
a
certainty
of
success
resumed
the
subject
who
told
you
m
dartagnan
that
the
king
had
no
navy
oh
i
take
no
heed
of
these
details
replied
the
captain
i
am
but
an
indifferent
sailor
like
all
nervous
people
i
hate
the
sea
and
yet
i
have
an
idea
that
with
ships
france
being
a
seaport
with
two
hundred
exits
we
might
have
sailors
colbert
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
oblong
book
divided
into
two
columns
on
the
first
were
the
names
of
vessels
on
the
other
the
figures
recapitulating
the
number
of
cannon
and
men
requisite
to
equip
these
ships
i
have
had
the
same
idea
as
you
said
he
to
dartagnan
and
i
have
had
an
account
drawn
up
of
the
vessels
we
have
altogetherthirtyfive
ships
thirtyfive
ships
impossible
cried
dartagnan
something
like
two
thousand
pieces
of
cannon
said
colbert
that
is
what
the
king
possesses
at
this
moment
of
five
and
thirty
vessels
we
can
make
three
squadrons
but
i
must
have
five
five
cried
aramis
they
will
be
afloat
before
the
end
of
the
year
gentlemen
the
king
will
have
fifty
ship
of
the
line
we
may
venture
on
a
contest
with
them
may
we
not
to
build
vessels
said
dartagnan
is
difficult
but
possible
as
to
arming
them
how
is
that
to
be
done
in
france
there
are
neither
foundries
nor
military
docks
bah
replied
colbert
in
a
bantering
tone
i
have
planned
all
that
this
year
and
a
half
past
did
you
not
know
it
do
you
know
m
dimfreville
dimfreville
replied
dartagnan
no
he
is
a
man
i
have
discovered
he
has
a
specialty
he
is
a
man
of
geniushe
knows
how
to
set
men
to
work
it
is
he
who
has
cast
cannon
and
cut
the
woods
of
bourgogne
and
then
monsieur
lambassadeur
you
may
not
believe
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
but
i
have
a
still
further
idea
oh
monsieur
said
aramis
civilly
i
always
believe
you
calculating
upon
the
character
of
the
dutch
our
allies
i
said
to
myself
they
are
merchants
they
are
friendly
with
the
king
they
will
be
happy
to
sell
to
the
king
what
they
fabricate
for
themselves
then
the
more
we
buyah
i
must
add
this
i
have
forantdo
you
know
forant
dartagnan
colbert
in
his
warmth
forgot
himself
he
called
the
captain
simply
dartagnan
as
the
king
did
but
the
captain
only
smiled
at
it
no
replied
he
i
do
not
know
him
that
is
another
man
i
have
discovered
with
a
genius
for
buying
this
forant
has
purchased
for
me
350000
pounds
of
iron
in
balls
200000
pounds
of
powder
twelve
cargoes
of
northern
timber
matches
grenades
pitch
tari
know
not
what
with
a
saving
of
seven
per
cent
upon
what
all
those
articles
would
cost
me
fabricated
in
france
that
is
a
capital
and
quaint
idea
replied
dartagnan
to
have
dutch
cannonballs
cast
which
will
return
to
the
dutch
is
it
not
with
loss
too
and
colbert
laughed
aloud
he
was
delighted
with
his
own
joke
still
further
added
he
these
same
dutch
are
building
for
the
king
at
this
moment
six
vessels
after
the
model
of
the
best
of
their
name
destouchesah
perhaps
you
dont
know
destouches
no
monsieur
he
is
a
man
who
has
a
sure
glance
to
discern
when
a
ship
is
launched
what
are
the
defects
and
qualities
of
that
shipthat
is
valuable
observe
nature
is
truly
whimsical
well
this
destouches
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
man
likely
to
prove
useful
in
marine
affairs
and
he
is
superintending
the
construction
of
six
vessels
of
seventyeight
guns
which
the
provinces
are
building
for
his
majesty
it
results
from
this
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
that
the
king
if
he
wished
to
quarrel
with
the
provinces
would
have
a
very
pretty
fleet
now
you
know
better
than
anybody
else
if
the
land
army
is
efficient
dartagnan
and
aramis
looked
at
each
other
wondering
at
the
mysterious
labors
this
man
had
undertaken
in
so
short
a
time
colbert
understood
them
and
was
touched
by
this
best
of
flatteries
if
we
in
france
were
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
said
dartagnan
out
of
france
still
less
must
be
known
that
is
why
i
told
monsieur
lambassadeur
said
colbert
that
spain
promising
its
neutrality
england
helping
us
if
england
assists
you
said
aramis
i
promise
the
neutrality
of
spain
i
take
you
at
your
word
colbert
hastened
to
reply
with
his
blunt
bonhomie
and
a
propos
of
spain
you
have
not
the
golden
fleece
monsieur
dalmeda
i
heard
the
king
say
the
other
day
that
he
should
like
to
see
you
wear
the
grand
cordon
of
st
michael
aramis
bowed
oh
thought
dartagnan
and
porthos
is
no
longer
here
what
ells
of
ribbons
would
there
be
for
him
in
these
largesses
dear
porthos
monsieur
dartagnan
resumed
colbert
between
us
two
you
will
have
i
wager
an
inclination
to
lead
your
musketeers
into
holland
can
you
swim
and
he
laughed
like
a
man
in
high
good
humor
like
an
eel
replied
dartagnan
ah
but
there
are
some
bitter
passages
of
canals
and
marshes
yonder
monsieur
dartagnan
and
the
best
swimmers
are
sometimes
drowned
there
it
is
my
profession
to
die
for
his
majesty
said
the
musketeer
only
as
it
is
seldom
in
war
that
much
water
is
met
with
without
a
little
fire
i
declare
to
you
beforehand
that
i
will
do
my
best
to
choose
fire
i
am
getting
old
water
freezes
mebut
fire
warms
monsieur
colbert
and
dartagnan
looked
so
handsome
still
in
quasijuvenile
strength
as
he
pronounced
these
words
that
colbert
in
his
turn
could
not
help
admiring
him
dartagnan
perceived
the
effect
he
had
produced
he
remembered
that
the
best
tradesman
is
he
who
fixes
a
high
price
upon
his
goods
when
they
are
valuable
he
prepared
his
price
in
advance
so
then
said
colbert
we
go
into
holland
yes
replied
dartagnan
only
only
said
m
colbert
only
repeated
dartagnan
there
lurks
in
everything
the
question
of
interest
the
question
of
selflove
it
is
a
very
fine
title
that
of
captain
of
the
musketeers
but
observe
this
we
have
now
the
kings
guards
and
the
military
household
of
the
king
a
captain
of
musketeers
ought
to
command
all
that
and
then
he
would
absorb
a
hundred
thousand
livres
a
year
for
expenses
well
but
do
you
suppose
the
king
would
haggle
with
you
said
colbert
eh
monsieur
you
have
not
understood
me
replied
dartagnan
sure
of
carrying
his
point
i
was
telling
you
that
i
an
old
captain
formerly
chief
of
the
kings
guard
having
precedence
of
the
marechaux
of
francei
saw
myself
one
day
in
the
trenches
with
two
other
equals
the
captain
of
the
guards
and
the
colonel
commanding
the
swiss
now
at
no
price
will
i
suffer
that
i
have
old
habits
and
i
will
stand
or
fall
by
them
colbert
felt
this
blow
but
he
was
prepared
for
it
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
just
now
replied
he
about
what
monsieur
we
were
speaking
of
canals
and
marshes
in
which
people
are
drowned
well
well
if
they
are
drowned
it
is
for
want
of
a
boat
a
plank
or
a
stick
of
a
stick
however
short
it
may
be
said
dartagnan
exactly
said
colbert
and
therefore
i
never
heard
of
an
instance
of
a
marechal
of
france
being
drowned
dartagnan
became
very
pale
with
joy
and
in
a
not
very
firm
voice
people
would
be
very
proud
of
me
in
my
country
said
he
if
i
were
a
marechal
of
france
but
a
man
must
have
commanded
an
expedition
in
chief
to
obtain
the
baton
monsieur
said
colbert
here
is
in
this
pocketbook
which
you
will
study
a
plan
of
campaign
you
will
have
to
lead
a
body
of
troops
to
carry
out
in
the
next
spring
12
dartagnan
took
the
book
tremblingly
and
his
fingers
meeting
those
of
colbert
the
minister
pressed
the
hand
of
the
musketeer
loyally
monsieur
said
he
we
had
both
a
revenge
to
take
one
over
the
other
i
have
begun
it
is
now
your
turn
i
will
do
you
justice
monsieur
replied
dartagnan
and
implore
you
to
tell
the
king
that
the
first
opportunity
that
shall
offer
he
may
depend
upon
a
victory
or
to
behold
me
deador
both
then
i
will
have
the
fleursdelis
for
your
marechals
baton
prepared
immediately
said
colbert
on
the
morrow
aramis
who
was
setting
out
for
madrid
to
negotiate
the
neutrality
of
spain
came
to
embrace
dartagnan
at
his
hotel
let
us
love
each
other
for
four
said
dartagnan
we
are
now
but
two
and
you
will
perhaps
never
see
me
again
dear
dartagnan
said
aramis
if
you
knew
how
i
have
loved
you
i
am
old
i
am
extinctah
i
am
almost
dead
my
friend
said
dartagnan
you
will
live
longer
than
i
shall
diplomacy
commands
you
to
live
but
for
my
part
honor
condemns
me
to
die
bah
such
men
as
we
are
monsieur
le
marechal
said
aramis
only
die
satisfied
with
joy
in
glory
ah
replied
dartagnan
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
assure
you
monsieur
le
duc
i
feel
very
little
appetite
for
either
they
once
more
embraced
and
two
hours
after
separatedforever
the
death
of
dartagnan
contrary
to
that
which
generally
happens
whether
in
politics
or
morals
each
kept
his
promises
and
did
honor
to
his
engagements
the
king
recalled
m
de
guiche
and
banished
m
le
chevalier
de
lorraine
so
that
monsieur
became
ill
in
consequence
madame
set
out
for
london
where
she
applied
herself
so
earnestly
to
make
her
brother
charles
ii
acquire
a
taste
for
the
political
counsels
of
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
that
the
alliance
between
england
and
france
was
signed
and
the
english
vessels
ballasted
by
a
few
millions
of
french
gold
made
a
terrible
campaign
against
the
fleets
of
the
united
provinces
charles
ii
had
promised
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
a
little
gratitude
for
her
good
counsels
he
made
her
duchess
of
portsmouth
colbert
had
promised
the
king
vessels
munitions
victories
he
kept
his
word
as
is
well
known
at
length
aramis
upon
whose
promises
there
was
least
dependence
to
be
placed
wrote
colbert
the
following
letter
on
the
subject
of
the
negotiations
which
he
had
undertaken
at
madrid
monsieur
colberti
have
the
honor
to
expedite
to
you
the
r
p
oliva
general
ad
interim
of
the
society
of
jesus
my
provisional
successor
the
reverend
father
will
explain
to
you
monsieur
colbert
that
i
preserve
to
myself
the
direction
of
all
the
affairs
of
the
order
which
concern
france
and
spain
but
that
i
am
not
willing
to
retain
the
title
of
general
which
would
throw
too
high
a
sidelight
on
the
progress
of
the
negotiations
with
which
his
catholic
majesty
wishes
to
intrust
me
i
shall
resume
that
title
by
the
command
of
his
majesty
when
the
labors
i
have
undertaken
in
concert
with
you
for
the
great
glory
of
god
and
his
church
shall
be
brought
to
a
good
end
the
r
p
oliva
will
inform
you
likewise
monsieur
of
the
consent
his
catholic
majesty
gives
to
the
signature
of
a
treaty
which
assures
the
neutrality
of
spain
in
the
event
of
a
war
between
france
and
the
united
provinces
this
consent
will
be
valid
even
if
england
instead
of
being
active
should
satisfy
herself
with
remaining
neutral
as
for
portugal
of
which
you
and
i
have
spoken
monsieur
i
can
assure
you
it
will
contribute
with
all
its
resources
to
assist
the
most
christian
king
in
his
war
i
beg
you
monsieur
colbert
to
preserve
your
friendship
and
also
to
believe
in
my
profound
attachment
and
to
lay
my
respect
at
the
feet
of
his
most
christian
majesty
signed
le
duc
dalmeda

aramis
had
performed
more
than
he
had
promised
it
remained
to
be
seen
how
the
king
m
colbert
and
dartagnan
would
be
faithful
to
each
other
in
the
spring
as
colbert
had
predicted

on
its
campaign
it
preceded
in
magnificent
order
the
court
of
louis
xiv
who
setting
out
on
horseback
surrounded
by
carriages
filled
with
ladies
and
courtiers
conducted
the
elite
of
his
kingdom
to
this
sanguinary
fete
the
officers
of
the
army
it
is
true
had
no
other
music
save
the
artillery
of
the
dutch
forts
but
it
was
enough
for
a
great
number
who
found
in
this
war
honor

m
dartagnan
set
out
commanding
a
body
of
twelve
thousand
men
cavalry
and
infantry
with
which
he
was
ordered
to
take
the
different
places
which
form
knots
of
that
strategic
network
called
la
frise
never
was
an
army
conducted
more
gallantly
to
an
expedition
the
officers
knew
that
their
leader
prudent
and
skillful
as
he
was
brave
would
not
sacrifice
a
single
man
nor
yield
an
inch
of
ground
without
necessity
he
had
the
old
habits
of
war
to
live
upon
the
country
keeping
his
soldiers
singing
and
the

month
he
was
engaged
in
besieging
the
thirteenth
which
had
held
out
five
days
dartagnan
caused
the
trenches
to
be
opened
without
appearing
to
suppose
that
these
people
would
ever
allow
themselves
to
be
taken
the
pioneers
and
laborers
were
in
the
army
of
this
man
a
body
full
of
ideas
and
zeal
because
their
commander
treated
them
like
soldiers

how
to
render
their
work
glorious

never
allowed

turned
over

turfheaps
mounds
of
potters

at

soldiers

housewives
m
dartagnan
dispatched
a
courier
to
the
king
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
last
success
which
redoubled
the
good
humor
of

majesty

inclination

amuse
the
ladies

victories

so
much
majesty
to
the
prince
that
madame
de

no
longer
called
him
anything
but
louis
the
invincible
so
that
mademoiselle
de

valliere
who
only
called
the
king
louis
the
victorious
lost
much
of
his
majestys
favor
besides
her
eyes
were
frequently
red
and
to
an
invincible
nothing
is
more
disagreeable
than
a
mistress
who
weeps
while
everything
is
smiling
round
her
the
star
of
mademoiselle
de

was
being
drowned
in
clouds
and
tears
but
the
gayety
of
madame
de
montespan
redoubled
with
the
successes
of
the
king
and
consoled
him
for
every
other
unpleasant
circumstance
it
was
to
dartagnan
the
king
owed
this
and
his
majesty
was
anxious
to
acknowledge
these
services
he
wrote
to
m
colbert

consequence
of
this

detaining
dartagnans
envoy
placed
in
the
hands
of
that
messenger
a
letter
from
himself
and
a
small
coffer
of
ebony
inlaid
with
gold
not
very
important
in
appearance
but
which
without
doubt
was
very
heavy
as
a
guard
of
five
men
was
given
to
the
messenger
to
assist
him
in
carrying
it
these
people
arrived
before
the
place
which
dartagnan
was
besieging
towards
daybreak
and
presented
themselves
at
the
lodgings
of
the
general
they
were
told
that
m
dartagnan
annoyed
by
a
sortie
which
the
governor
an
artful
man
had
made
the
evening
before
and
in
which
the
works
had
been
destroyed
and
seventyseven
men
killed
and
the
reparation
of
the
breaches
commenced
had
just
gone
with
twenty
companies
of
grenadiers
to
reconstruct
the
works
m
colberts
envoy
had
orders
to
go
and
seek
m
dartagnan
wherever
he
might
be
or
at
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
he
directed
his
course
therefore
towards
the
trenches
followed
by
his
escort
all
on
horseback
they
perceived
m
dartagnan
in
the
open
plain
with
his
goldlaced
hat
his
long
cane
and
gilt
cuffs
he
was
biting
his
white
mustache
and
wiping
off
with
his
left
hand
the
dust
which
the
passing
balls
threw
up
from
the
ground
they
plowed
so
near
him
they
also
saw
amidst
this
terrible
fire
which
filled
the
air
with
whistling
hisses
officers
handling
the
shovel
soldiers
rolling
barrows
and
vast
fascines
rising
by
being
either
carried
or
dragged
by
from
ten
to
twenty
men
cover
the
front
of
the
trench
reopened
to
the
center
by
this
extraordinary
effort
of
the
general
in
three
hours
all
was
reinstated
dartagnan
began
to
speak
more
mildly
and
he
became
quite
calm
when
the
captain
of
the
pioneers
approached
him
hat
in
hand
to
tell
him
that
the
trench
was
again
in
proper
order
this
man
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
a
ball
took
off
one
of
his
legs
and
he
fell
into
the
arms
of
dartagnan
the
latter
lifted
up
his
soldier
and
quietly
with
soothing
words
carried
him
into
the
trench
amidst
the
enthusiastic
applause
of
the
regiments
from
that
time
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
valorthe
army
was
delirious
two
companies
stole
away
to
the
advanced
posts
which
they
instantly
destroyed
when
their
comrades
restrained
with
great
difficulty
by
dartagnan
saw
them
lodged
upon
the
bastions
they
rushed
forward
likewise
and
soon
a
furious
assault
was
made
upon
the
counterscarp
upon
which
depended
the
safety
of
the
place
dartagnan
perceived
there
was
only
one
means
left
of
checking
his
armyto
take
the
place
he
directed
all
his
force
to
the
two
breaches
where
the
besieged
were
busy
in
repairing
the
shock
was
terrible
eighteen
companies
took
part
in
it
and
dartagnan
went
with
the
rest
within
half
cannonshot
of
the
place
to
support
the
attack
by
echelons
the
cries
of
the
dutch
who
were
being
poniarded
upon
their
guns
by
dartagnans
grenadiers
were
distinctly
audible
the
struggle
grew
fiercer
with
the
despair
of
the
governor
who
disputed
his
position
foot
by
foot
dartagnan
to
put
an
end
to
the
affair
and
to
silence
the
fire
which
was
unceasing
sent
a
fresh
column
which
penetrated
like
a
very
wedge
and
he
soon
perceived
upon
the
ramparts
through
the
fire
the
terrified
flight
of
the
besieged
pursued
by
the
besiegers
at
this
moment
the
general
breathing
feely
and
full
of
joy
heard
a
voice
behind
him
saying
monsieur
if
you
please
from
m
colbert
he
broke
the
seal
of
the
letter
which
contained
these
words
monsieur

standing
with
a
radiant
countenance
and
sparkling
eye

looked
up
to
watch
the
progress
of

enveloped
in

to

hour

then

dartagnan
intoxicated
with
joy
made
a
sign
to
the
messenger
who
approached
with
his
coffret
in
his
hands
but
at
the
moment
the
marechal
was
going
to
look
at
it
a
loud
explosion
resounded
from
the
ramparts
and
called
his
attention
towards
the
city
it
is
strange
said
dartagnan
that
i
dont
yet
see
the
kings
flag
on
the
walls
or
hear
the
drums
beat
the
chamade
he
launched
three
hundred
fresh
men
under
a
highspirited
officer
and
ordered
another
breach
to
be
made
then
more
tranquilly
he
turned
towards
the
coffret
which
colberts
envoy
held
out
to
himit
was
his
treasurehe
had
won
it
dartagnan
was
holding
out
his
hand
to
open
the
coffret
when
a
ball
from
the
city
crushed
the
coffret
in
the
arms
of
the
officer
struck
dartagnan
full
in
the
chest
and
knocked
him
down
upon
a
sloping
heap
of
earth
whilst
the
fleurdelised
baton
escaping
from
the
broken
box
came
rolling
under
the
powerless
hand
of
the
marechal
dartagnan
endeavored
to
raise
himself
it
was
thought
he
had
been
knocked
down
without
being
wounded
a
terrible
cry
broke
from
the
group
of
terrified
officers
the
marechal
was
covered
with
blood
the
pallor
of
death
ascended
slowly
to
his
noble
countenance
leaning
upon
the
arms
held
out
on
all
sides
to
receive
him
he
was
able
once
more
to
turn
his
eyes
towards
the
place
and
to
distinguish
the
white
flag
at
the
crest
of
the
principal
bastion
his
ears
already
deaf
to
the
sounds
of
life
caught
feebly
the
rolling
of
the
drum
which
announced
the
victory
then
clasping
in
his
nerveless
hand
the
baton
ornamented
with
its
fleursdelis
he
cast
on
it
his
eyes
which
had
no
longer
the
power
of
looking
upwards
towards
heaven
and
fell
back
murmuring
strange
words
