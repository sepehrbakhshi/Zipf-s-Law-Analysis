preface
to
the
american
edition
among
the
works
of
every
writer
of
fiction
there
are
generally
one
or
two
that
owe
their
being
to
some
haunting
thought
long
communed
witha
thought
which
has
at
last
found
a
living
shape
in
some
story
of
deed
and
passion
i
say
one
or
two
advisedly
for
the
span
of
mans
active
life
is
short
and
such
haunting
fancies
are
of
their
essence
solitary
as
a
matter
of
fact
indeed
the
majority
of
a
novelists
creations
belong
to
another
class
must
of
necessity
if
he
be
a
prolific
creator
find
their
conception
in
more
sudden
impulses
the
great
family
of
the
children
of
his
brain
must
be
born
of
inspirations
ever
new
and
in
alluring
freshness
go
forth
into
the
world
surrounded
by
the
atmosphere
of
their
authors
present
mood
decked
in
the
colours
of
his
latest
imaginings
strengthened
by
his
latest
passional
impressions
and
philosophical
conclusions
in
the
latter
category
the
lack
of
long
intimate
acquaintance
between
the
author
and
the
friends
or
foes
he
depicts
is
amply
compensated
for
by
the
enthusiasm
appertaining
to
new
discoveries
as
each
character
reveals
itself
often
in
quite
unforeseen
manner
and
the
consequences
of
each
event
shape
themselves
inevitably
and
sometimes
indeed
almost
against
his
will
although
dissimilar
in
their
genesis
both
kinds
of
stories
can
in
the
telling
be
equally
lifelike
and
equally
alluring
to
the
reader
but
what
of
the
writer
among
his
literary
family
is
there
not
one
nearer
his
heart
than
all
the
resthis
dreamchild
it
may
be
the
stoutest
of
the
breed
or
it
may
be

may
be
the
firstborn

fathers
in
the

this
secret
tenderness
many
a
child
and
many
a
book
is
brooded
over
with
a
special
love
even
before
its
birthloved
thus
for
no
grace
or
merit
of
its
own
this
book
is
my
dreamchild





here
by
the
way
i
should
like
to
say
my
word
in
honour
of
fictionfiction
contradistinguished
from
what
is
popularly
termed
serious
writing
if
in
a
story
the
characters
and
the
events
are
truly
convincing
if
the
former
are
appealingly
human
and
the
latter
are
so
carefully
devised
and
described
as
never
to
evoke
the
idea
of
improbability
then
it
can
make
no
difference
in
the
intellectual
pleasure
of
the
reader
whether
what
he
is
made
to
realise
so
vividly
is
a
record
of
fact
or
of
mere
fancy
facts
we
read
of
are
of
necessity
past
what
is
past
what
is
beyond
the
immediate
ken
of
our
senses
can
only
be
realised
in
imagination
and
the
picture
we
are
able
to
make
of
it
for
ourselves
depends
altogether
on
the
sympathetic
skill
of
the

before
us
as
rob
roy
macgregor
whose
existence
was
so
undeniably
tangible
to
the
men
of
his
days
do
we
not
see
in
our
minds

and
know
as
clearly
the
lovable

john

of

romance
as
his
contemporaries

alike
of
the
plainest
facts
or
of
the
veriest
imaginings
are
but
pictures
it
matters
very
little
therefore
whether
the
man
or
the
woman
we
read
of
but
never
can
see
in
the
flesh
has
really
lived
or
not
if
what
we
do
read
raises
an
emotion
in
our
hearts
to
the
novelist
every
character
each
in
his
own
degree
is
almost
as
living
as
a
personal
acquaintance
every
event
is
as
clear
as
a
personal
experience
and
if
this
be
true
of
the
story
written

la
grce
de
la
plume
where
both
events
and
characters
unfold
themselves
like
the
buds
of
some
unknown
plant
how
much
more
strongly
is
it
the
case
of
the
story
that
has
so
long
been
mused
over
that
one
day
it
had
to
be
told
then
the
marking
events
of
the
actors
lives
their
adventures
whether
of
sorrow
or
of
joy
their
sayings
and
doings
noble
or
bright
or
mistaken
recorded
in
the
book
are
but
a
tithe
of
the
adventures
sayings
and
doings
with
which
the
writer
seems
to
be
familiar
he
might
write
or
talk
about
them
in
praise
or
vindictiveness
as
he
loves
or
dreads
them
for
many
a
longer
daybut
he
has
one
main
theme
to
make
clear
to
his
hearers
and
must
respect
the
modern
canons
of
the
storytelling
art
among
the
many
things
therefore
he
could
tell
an
he
would
he
selects
that
only
which
will
unravel
a
particular
thread
of
fate
in
the
tangle
of
endless
consequences
which
will
render
plausible
the
growth
of
passions
on
which
in
a
continuous
lifedrama
is
based
one
particular
episode
of
such
a
kind
is
the
story
of
adrian
landale
the
haunting
thought
round
which
the
tale
of
the
sorely
tempesttossed
dreamer
is
gathered
is
one
which
i
think
must
at
one
time
or
other
have
occurred
to
many
a
man
as
he
neared
the
maturity
of
middlelifewhat
form
of
turmoil
would
come
into
his
heart
if
when
still
in
the
strength
of
his
age
but
after
long
years
of
hopeless
separation
he
were
again
brought
face
to
face
with
the
woman
who
had
been
the
one
passion
of
his
life
the
first
and
only
love
of
his
youth
and
what
if
she
were
still
then
exactly
as
he
had
last
seen
hershe
untouched
by
years
even
as
she
had
so
long
lived
in
his
thoughts
he
with
his
soul
scarred
and
seamed
by
many
encounters
bravely
sustained
in
the
battle
of
life
the
problem
thus
propounded
is
not
solvable
even
in
fiction
unless
it
be
by
fantastic
treatment
but
perhaps
the
more
so
on
this
account
did
it
haunt
me
and
out
of
the
travail
of
my
mind
around
it
out
of
the
changing
shadows
of
restless
speculation
gradually
emerged
clear
and
alive
the
being
of
adrian
landale
and
his
two
loves
here
then
was
a
man
whose
mind
moulded
by
nature
for
grace
and
contemplation
was
cast
by
fate
amid
all
the
turmoils
of
romance
and
action
here
was
one
of
those
whose
warm
heart
and
idealising
enthusiasm
must
wreathe
the
beauty
of
love
into
all
the
beauties
of
the
world
whose
ideals
are
spent
on
one
adored
object
who
having
lost
it
seems
to
have
lost
the
very
sense
of
love
to
whom
love
never
could
return
save
by
some
miracle
but
fortune
that
had
been
so
cruelly
hard
on
him
one
day
in
her
blind
way
brings
back
to
his
door
the
miraculous
restitutionand
there
leaves
him
to
struggle
along
the
new
path
of
his
fate
it
is
there
also
that
i
take
up
the
thread
of
the
speculation
and
watch
through
its
vicissitudes
the
working
of
the
problem
raised
by
such
a
strange
circumstance
the
surroundings
in
a
story
of
this
kind
are
of
the
nature
of
things
all
those
of
romance
and
by
romance
i
would
point
out
is
not
necessarily
meant
in
taletelling
a
chain
of
events
fraught
with
greater
improbability
than
those
of
socalled
real
life
indeed
where
is
now
the
writer
who
will
for
a
moment
admit
even
tacitly
that
his
records
are
not
of
reality
it
simply
betokens
a
specialisation
of
the
wider
genus
novel
a
narrative
of
strong
action
and
moving
incident
in
addition
to
the
necessary
analysis
of
character
a
story
in
which
the
uncertain
violence
of
the
outside
world
turns
the
course
of
the
actors
lives
from
the
more
obvious
channels
it
connotes
also
as
a
rule
more
poignant
emotionsemotions
born
of
strife
or
peril
even
of
horror
it
tells
of
the
shock
of
arms
in
life
rather
than
of
the
mere
diplomacy
of
life
above
all
romance
depends
upon
picturesque
and
varied
setting
upon
the
scenery
of
the
drama
so
to
speak
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
essentially
though
this
has
sometimes
been
advanced
a
narrative
of
mere
adventures
as
contrasted
to
the
observation
and
dissection
of
character
and
manners
we
find
in
the
true
novel
rather
be
it
said
that
it
is
one
in
which
the
hidden
soul
is
made
patent
under
the
touchstone

incidents

hairbreadth

human
life
on
the
whole
was
held
rather
cheap
in
consequence
they
are
the
days
when
in
liverpool
the
privateers
were
daily
fitting
out
or
bringing
in
the
prizes
and
when
in
lord
street
offices
distant
cargoes
of
living
ebony
were
put
to
auction
by
steady
intensely
respectable
churchgoing
merchants
but
especially
they
are
the
days
of
war
and
the
fortunes
of
war
days
of
pressgangs
to
kidnap
unwilling
rulers
of
the
waves
of
hulks
and
prisons
filled
to
overflowing
even
in
a
mere
commercial
port
like
liverpool
with
french
prisoners
of

a
long
course
of
relentless
hostilities
lasting
the
span
of

fullgrown
generation
had
cultivated
the
predatory
instinct
of
all
men

the
temperament
of
action

seemed
to
justify

their
way

reduced

road

up
privateering
on
a
systematic
scale
in
such
an
atmosphere
there
could
not
fail
to
return
a
belief
in
the
good
old
border
rule
the
simple
plan
that
they
should
take
who
have
the
power
and
they
should
keep
who
can
and
it
must
be
remembered
that

on
that
ethical
understanding
many
privateer
owners
built
up
large
fortunes
still
enjoyed
by
descendants
who
in
these
days
would
look
upon
highsea
looting
of
noncombatants
with
definite
horror
the
years
of
the
great
french
war
however
fostered
a
species
of
nautical
enterprise
more
venturesome
even
than
privateering
raiding
blockaderunning
and
all
the
ordinary
forms
of
smuggling
that
are
usual
when
two
coast
lines
are
at
enmity
i
mean
that
smuggling
of
gold
specie
and
bullion
which
incidentally
was
destined
to
affect
the
course
of
sir
adrians
life
so
powerfully





as
captain
jacks
last
venture
may
at
this
distance
of
time
appear
a
little
improbable
it
is
well
to
state
here
some
littleknown
facts
concerning
the
now
rather
incomprehensible
pursuit
of
gold
smugglinga
romantic
subject
if
ever
there
was
one
the
existence
at
one
time
of
this
form
of
freetrade
is
all
but
forgotten
indeed
very
little
was
ever
heard
of
it
in
the
world
except
among
parties
directly
interested
even
at
the
time
when
it
played
an
important
part
in
the
machinery
of
governments
its
rise
during
the
years
of
napoleonic
tyranny
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
its
continuance
during
the
factitious
calm
of
the
first
restoration
in
france
were
due
to
circumstances
that
never
existed
before
and
are
little
likely
to
occur
again
the
accumulation
of
a
fund
of
gold
coin
reserved
against
sudden
contingency
was
one
of
bonapartes
imperial
ideas
in
a
modified
and
more
modern
form
this
notion
of
a
warchest
untouched
and
unproductive
in
peacetime
is
still
adhered
to
by
the
germans
they
have
kept
to
heart
many
of
their
former
conquerors
lessons
lessons
forgotten
by
the
french
themselvesand
the
enormous
treasure
of
gold
bags
guarded
at
spandau
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
napoleon
however
in
his
triumphant
days
never
and
for
obvious
reasons
lacked
money
it
was
less
an
actual
treasure
that
he
required
and
valued
so
highly
for
political
and
military
purposes
than
an
ever
ready
reserve
of
wealth
easily
portable
of
paramount
value
at
all
times
concentrated
so
to
speak
and
nothing
could
come
nearer
to
that
description
than
rolls
of
english
guineas
indeed
the
vast
numbers
of
these
coins
which
fitfully
appeared
in
circulation
throughout
europe
justified
the
many
weird
legends
concerning
the
power
of
british
goldlor
anglais
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
in
days
when
the
national
currency
consisted
chiefly
of
lumbering
silver
cus
the
bourbon
government
also
appreciated
to
the
full
the
value
of
a
private
gold
reserve
at
any
rate
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
first
restoration
that
the
golden
guinea
of
england
found
in
france
its
highest
premium
without
going
into
the
vexed
and
dreary
question
of
single
or
double
standard
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
during
the
early
years
of
the
century
now
about
to
close
gold
coin
was
leaving
england
at
a
rate
which
not
only
appeared
phenomenal
but
was
held
to
be
injurious
to
the
community
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
it
was
finding
its
way
to
france
whilst
great
britain
was
flooded
with
silver
it
was
then
made
illegal
to
export
gold
coin
or
bullion
the
prohibition
was
stringently
indeed
at
one
time
ruthlessly
enforced
in
this
manner
the
new
and
highly
profitable
traffic
in
english
guineas
entered
the
province
of
the
freetrader
the
difference
introduced
in
his
practice
being
merely
one
of
degree
whereas
in
the
case
of
prohibited
imports
the
chief
task
lay
in
running
the
illicit
goods
and
distributing
them
in
the
case
of
guineasmuggling
its
arduousness
was
further
increased
by
the
danger
of
collecting
the
gold
inland
and
clearing
from
home
harbours
very
little
as
i
said
has
ever
been
heard
of
this
singular
trade
and
for
obvious
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
obtained
only
for
a
comparatively
small
number
of
years
the
latter
part
of
the
great
war
the
last
of
it
belonging
to
the
period
of
the
hundred
days
and
in
the
second
it
was
at
all
times
of
necessity
confined
to
a
very
small
number
of
freetrading
skippers
of
adventurous
men
in
stirring
days
there
were
of
course
a
multitude
but
few
naturally
were
the
men
to
whose
honour
the
custody
of
so
much
ready
wealth
could
safely
be
intrusted
that
is
where
as
captain
jack
says
sometimes
in
this
book
the
likes
of
me
come
in
the
exchange
was
enormously
profitable
as
much
as
thirtytwo
shillings
in
silver
value
could
at
one
time
be
obtained
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
for
an
english
guinea
but
the
shipper
and
broker
in
an
illegal
venture
where
contract
could
not
be
enforced
had
to
be
a
man
whose
simple
word
was
warrantyand
indeed
in
the
case
of
large
consignments
this
blind
trust
had
to
be
extended
to
almost
every
man
of
his
crew
what
a
romance
could
be
written
upon
this
theme
alone
in
the
story
of
adrian
landale
however
it
plays
but
a
subsidiary
part
brave
joyoushearted
captain
jack
and
his
bold
venture
for
a
fortune
appear
only
in
the
drama
to
turn
its
previous
course
to
unforeseen
channels
just
as
in
most
of
our
lives
the
sudden
intrusion
of
a
new
strong
personalitytransient
though
it
may
be
a
tempest
or
a
meteorchanges
their
seemingly
inevitable
trend
to
altogether
new
issues





it
was
urged
by
my
english
publishers
that
in
the
light
of
scarthey
i
relate
two
distinct
lovestories
and
two
distinct
phases
of
one
mans
life
and
that
it
were
wiser
by
which
word
i
presume
was
meant
more
profitable
to
distribute
the
tale
between
two
books
one
to
be
a
sequel
to
the
other
happily
i
would
not
be
persuaded
to
cut
a
fully
composed
canvas
in
two
for
the
sake
of
the
frames
it
is
the
fate
of
sequels
as
stevenson
said
in
his
dedication
of
catriona
to
disappoint
those
who
have
waited
for
them
besides
life
is
essentially
continuousit
may
not
be
inept
to
state
a
truism
of
this
kind
in
a
world
of
novels
where
the
climax
of
life
if
not
indeed
its
very
conclusion
is
held
to
be
reached
on
the
day
of
marriage
there
is
often
of
course
more
than
one
true
passion
of
love
in
a
mans
life
and
even
if
the
second
does
not
really
kill
the
memory
of
the
first
their
course
should
they
be
worth
the
telling
may
well
be
told
separately
but
if
in
the
story
of
a
mans
love
for
two
women
the
past
and
the
present
are
so
closely
interwoven
as
were
the
reality
and
the
mighthavebeen
in
the
mind
of
adrian
landale
any
separation
of
the
two
phases
youth
and
maturity
would
surely
have
stultified
the
whole
scheme
of
the
story
i
have
also
been
taken
to
task
by
some
critics
for
having
the
tale
once
opened
at
a
given
time
and
place
harked
back
to
other
days
and
other
scenes
an
inartistic
and
confusing
method
i
was
told
i
am
still
of
contrary
opinion
there
are
certain
stories
which
belong
by
their
very
essence
to
certain
places
all
ancient
buildings
have
if
we
only
knew
them
their
human
dramas
this
is
the
very
soul
of
the
hidden
but
irresistible
attraction
they
retain
for
us
even
when
deserted
and
dismantled
as
now
the
peel
of
scarthey
for
the
sake
of
harmonious
proportions
and
in
order
to
give
it
its
proper
atmosphere
it
was
imperative
that
in
this
dramawherever
the
intermediate
scenes
might
be
placed

on
the
banks
of
the

also

in

to
transplant
his

the
while
this
adrian

ancestral
home
stood
in
its
placid
and
double
pride
of
ancient
and
settled
wealth
only
some
few
miles
away
as
the
bee
flies
in
the
midst
of
its
noble
park
slightly
retired
from
the
coastline
and
from
its
upper
casements
could
be
descried
by
day
the
little
green
patch
of
scarthey
and
the
jagged
outline
of
its
ruins
on
the
yellow

glimmering
face
of
the
great
bay
and
by
night
the
light
of
its
turret
and
there
he
was
still
living
in
some
kind
of
happiness
in
the
year
fourteen
when
out
of
the
eternal
store
of
events
began
to
shape
themselves
the
latter
episodes
of
a
life
in
which
storm
and
peace
followed
each
other
as
abruptly
as
in
the
very
atmosphere
that
he
then
breathed
for
some
eight
years
he
had
nested
on
that
rock
with
no
other
companions
but
a
dog
a
very
ancient
housekeeper
who
cooked
and
washed
for
t
young
mester
as
she
obstinately
persisted
in
calling
the
man
whom
she
had
once
nursed
upon
her
knee

a
singular
sturdy
foreign
man

as

his
adoption

latter
was
more
than
suspected
of
having
escaped
from
the

that
time
the
lawful
place
of
custody
of
french
war
prisoners
his
own
voluntary
captivity
however
had
nothing
really
dismal
for
adrian
landale
and
the
inhabited
portions
of
scarthey
ruins
had
certainly
nothing
prisonlike
about
them
nothing
even
that
recalled
the
wilful
contrition
of
a
hermitage
on

paused
after
her
wont
to
wait
till
the
sounds
had
filtered
as
far
as
her
intellect
then
proceeded
to
give
a
few
angry
headshakes

but
a
pint
of

left
and
it
the
last
pointing
her
withered
finger
erratically
as
the
palsy
shook
it
at
a
cutglass
decanter
where
a
modicum
of
port
wine
sparkled
richly
under
the
facets

believe
after
all
you
are
as
fond
of
him
at
the
bottom
of
your

as
i
am
now
what
good

you

for

today
bending
from
his
great
height
to
inspect
the
refection
ahhum
excellent
the
old
woman
after
another
pause
for
comprehension
retired
battling
with
dignity
against
the
obvious
pleasure
caused
by
her
masters
affectionate
familiarity
and
the
latter
sat
down
at
a
small
table
in
front
of
the
south
window
through
this
deep
portholelike
aperture
he
could
whilst
disposing
of
his
simple
meal
watch
the
arrival
of
the
yawl
which
did
ferrying
duty
between
scarthey
and
the
mainland
the
sturdy
little
craft
heavily
laden
with
packages
was
being
hauled
up
to
its
usual
place
of
safety
high
on
the
shingle
bank
under
cover
of
a
remnant
of
walling
which
in
the
days
of
the
castles
strength
had
been
a
secure
landingplace
for
the
garrisons
boats
but
which
now
was
almost
filled
by
the
castup
sands
and
stone
of
the
beach
this
was
done
under
the
superintendence
of
ren
man
of
all
work
and
with
the
mechanical
intermediary
of
rollers
and
capstan
by
a
small
white
horse
shackled
to
a
lever
and
patiently
grinding
his
steady
rounds
on
the
sand
his
preliminary
task
achieved
the
man
after
a
few
friendly
smacks
set
the
beast
free
to
trot
back
to
his
loose
pasture
proceeding
himself
to
unship
his
cargo
through
the
narrow
frame
of
his
window
the
master
with
eyes
of
approval
could
see
the
servant
dexterously
load
himself
with
a
wellbalanced
pile
of
parcels
disappearing
to
return
after
intervals
emptyhanded
within
the
field
of
view
and
select
another
burden
now
heavier
now
more
bulky
in
due
course
ren
came
up
and
reported
himself
in
person
and
as
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
the
dark
doorway
framed
a
not
unstriking
presentment
a
younglooking
man
for
his
years
he
was
a
trifle
junior
to
his
master
short
and
sturdy
in
build
on
whose
very
broad
shoulders
sat
a
phenomenally
fair
headthe
hair
short
crisp
and
curly
in
colour
like
faded
towand
who
in
smilingly
respectful
silence
gazed
into
the
room
out
of
small
lightblue
eyes
brimful
of
alertness
and
intelligence
waiting
to
be
addressed
renny
said
adrian
landale
returning
the
glance
with
one
of
comfortable
friendliness
you
will
have
to
make
your
peace
with
margery
she
considers
that
you
neglect
me
shamefully
why
you
are
actually
twenty
minutes
late
after
three
days
journeying
and
perils
by
land
and
sea
the
frenchman
answered
the
pleasantry
by
a
broader
smile
and
a
scrape
and
your
honour
he
said
if
what
is
now
arriving
on
us
had
come
half
an
hour
sooner
i
should
have
rested
planted
there
with
a
jerk
of
the
flaxen
head
towards
the
mainland
turning
my
thumbs
till
tomorrow
at
the
least
we
shall
have
a
grain
number
one
soon
he
spoke
english
fluently
though
with
the
guttural
accent
of
brittany
and
an
unconquerable
tendency
to
translate
his
own
jargon
almost
word
for
word
in
their
daily
intercourse
master
and
man
had
come
for
many
years
past
to
eschew
french
almost
entirely
ren
had
let
it
be
understood
that
he
considered
his
proficiency
in
the
vernacular
quite
undeniable
and
with
characteristic
readiness
sir
adrian
had
fallen
in
with
the
little
vanity
in
former
days
the
dependants
form
of
address
had
been
monseigneur
considering
and
shrewdly
so
an
english
landowner
to
stand
in
that
relation
to
a
simple
individual
like
himself
in
later
days
monseigneur
having
demurred
at
the
appellation
my
lord
in
his
own
tongue
the
devoted
servant
had
discovered
your
honour
as
a
happy
substitute
and
adhered
to
this
discovery
with
satisfaction
oh
we
are
going
to
have
a
squall
say
you
interpreted
the
master
rising
to
inspect
the
weatherglass
which
in
truth
had
fallen
deep
with
much
suddenness
more
than
a
squall
i
think
this
looks
like
a
hurricane
coming
but
since
you
are
safe
home
alls
well
we
are
secure
and
sound
here
and
the
fishing
fleet
are
drawing
in
i
see
peering
through
the
seaward
window
and
now
continued
adrian
laying
down
his
napkin
and
brushing
away
a
few
crumbs
from
the
folds
of
a
faultless
silk
stock
what
have
you
for
me
thereand
what
news
news
your
honour
oh
for
that
i
have
news
this
time
said
mr
renny
potter
with
an
emphatic
nod
but
if
your
honour
will
permit
i
shall
say
them
last
i
have
brought
the
clothes
and
the
linen
the
wine
the
brandy
and
the
books
brandy
and
wine
your
honour
i
heard
out
of
the
last
prize
brought
into
liverpool
and
a
nantes
ship
it
was
toothis
in
a
pathetically
philosophical
tone
then
after
a
pause
also
provisions
and
bulbs
for
the
devils
pot
as
margery
will
call
it
but
there
is
no
saying
your
honour
eats
more
when
i
have
brought
him
back
onions
eschalot
and
ail
now
do
i
lie
your
honour
may
i
added
the
speaker
and
forthwith
took
his
answer
from
his
masters
smile
may
i
respectfully
see
what
the
old
one
has
kitchened
for
you
when
i
was
not
there
and
adrian
landale
with
some
amusement
watched
the
frenchman
rise
from
the
package
he
was
then
uncording
to
examine
the
platters
on
the
table
and
loudly
sniff

disdain

at

ah
your

sighed
the
man
returning
to
his
talk
you
others
english
are
big
and
strong
but
you
waste
great
things
in
small
enjoyment
oho
renny
said
the
lightkeeper
squire
as
he
leant
against
the
fireplace
leisurely
filling
a
long
clay
pipe
this
is
one
of
your
epigrams
i
must
make
a
note
of
it
anon
but
let
me
see
now
what
you
really
have
in
those
parcels
of
booksfor
books
they
are

they
not
so
carefully
and
neatly

assented
the
man
undoing
the
final
fold
of
paper
mr
young
in
the
high
street
of
liverpool
had
the
packets
ready
he
says
you
must
have
them
all
and
all
printed
this
year
what
so
many
people
can
want
to
say
i
for
my
count
cannot
comprehend
three
more
parcels
on
the
stairs
your
honour
mr
young
says
you
must
have
them
but
it
took
two
porters
to
carry
them
to
the
preston
diligence
not
without
eagerness
did
the
recluse
of
scarthey
bend
over
and
finger
the
unequal
rows
of
volumes
arrayed
on
the
table
and
with
a
smile
of
expectation
examine
the
labels

the

ah

what

has
to

on
such

topic
dear

mused
sir
adrian
sitting
down
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
the
excursion
how
widely
have
our
lives
drifted
apart
since
those
college
days
of
ours
when
we
both
believed
in
the
coming
millennium
and
the
noble
future
of
mankindnoble
mankind
he
read
a
few
lines
and
became
absorbed
whilst
ren
noiselessly
busied
himself
in
and
out
of
the
chamber
presently
he
got
up
book
in
hand
slowly
walked
to
the
north
window
and
passively
gazed
at
the
misty
distance
where
rose
the
blue
outline
of
the
lake
hills
so
my
old
friend
almost
forgotten
he
murmured
that
is
where
you
indite
such
worthy
lines
it
were
enough
to
tempt
me
out
into
mens
world
again
to
think
that
there
would
be
many
readers
and
lovers
abroad
of
these
words
of
yours
so
that
is
what
five
and
twenty
years
have
done
for
youwhat
would
you
say
to
what
they
have
done
for
me
it
was
a
long
retrospect
sir
adrian
was
deeply
immersed
in
thought
when
he
became
aware
that
his
servant
had
come
to
a
standstill
as
if
waiting
for
a
return
of
attention
and
in
answer
to
the
mute
appeal
he
turned
his
head
once
more
in
rens
direction
your
honour
everything
is
in
its
place
began
the
latter
with
a
fitting
sense
of
his
own
method
i
have
now
to
report
that
i
saw
your
man
of
business
in
lancaster
and
he
has
attended
to
the
matter
of
the
brothers
shearmans
boat
that
was
lost
i
saw
the
young
men
themselves
this
morning
they
are
as
grateful
to
sir
adrian
as
people
in
this
country
can
express
this
last
with
a
certain
superiority
sir
adrian
received
the
announcement
of
the
working
of
one
of
his
usual
bounties
with
a
quiet
smile
of
gratification
they
also
told
me
to
say
that
they
would
bring
the
firewood
and
the
turf
tomorrow
but
they
wont
be
able
to
do
that
because
we
shall
have
dirty
weather
then
they
told
me
that
when
your
honour
wants
fish
they
begged
your
honour
to
run
up
a
white
flag
over
the
lanternthey
thought
that
a
beautiful
ideaand
they
would
bring
some
as
soon
as
possible
i
took
on
myself
to
assure
them
that
i
could
catch
what
fish
your
honour
requires
and
the
prawns
too

but
that
is
what
they
asked
me
to
say
well
well
and
so
you
can
said
the
master
amused
by
the
show
of
subacute
jealousy
what
else
the
books
of
the
man
of
business
and
the
banker
are
on
the
table
i
have
also
brought
gazettes
from
liverpool
here
the
fellows
countenance
brimmed
with
the
sense
of
his
news
importance
i
know
your
honour
cares
little
for
them
but
this
time
i
think
you
will
read
them
peace
your
honour
it
is
the
peace
it
is
all

in

journalsthe
liverpool
mercury
renny
lifted
the
folded
sheets
from
the
table
and
handed
them
with
contained
glee
there
has
been
peace
these
six
months
and
we
never
knew
it
i
read
about
it

whole
way

from

our
old

are
coming
back
and
everything
to

as
in
the
old
days
sir
adrian
took
the
papers
not
without
eagerness
and
glanced
over
the
narrative
of
events
already
months
old
with
all
the
surprise
of
one
who
having
wilfully
shut
himself
out
from
the
affairs
of
the
world
ignored
the
series
of
disasters
that
had
brought
about
the
tyrants
downfall
as
you
say
my
friend
it
is
almost
incredible
he
said
at
length
then
thoughtfully
and
now
you
will
be
wanting
to
return
home
said
he
ren
who
had
been
scanning
his
masters
face
with
high
expectation
felt
his
heart
leap
as
he
thought
he
perceived
a
hidden
tone
of
regret
in
the
question
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
short
height
and
with
a
very
decided
voice
made
answer
straightway
i
shall
go
away
from
your
honour
the
day
when
your
honour
dismisses
me
if
your
honour
decides
to
live
on
this
rock
till
my
hour
or
his
strikeson
this
rock
with
him
i
remain
i
am
not
conceited
i
hope
but
what
pray
will
become
of
your
honour
here
without
me
there
was
force
in
this
last
remark
simply
as
it
was
pronounced
through
the
mist
of
interlacing
thoughts
suggested
by
the
word
peace
the
end
of
the
revolution
that
distant
event
which
nevertheless
had
had
such
sweeping
influence
over
the
course
of
his
whole
life
it
brought
a
faint
smile
to
sir
adrians
lips
he
took
two
steps
forward
and
laid
his
hand
familiarly
on
the
mans
broad
shoulder
and
in
a
musing
way
he
said
at
intervals
yes
yes
indeed
good
renny
what
would
become
of
mewhat
would
have
become
of

long
ago
it
seemswithout
you
and
yet
it
might
have
been
as
well
if
two
skeletons
closely
locked
in
embrace
blanched
by
the
grinding
of
the
waters
and
the
greed
of
the
crabs
now
reposed
somewhere
deep
in
the
sands
of
that
vilaine
estuary
this
score
of
years
she
has
had
rest
from
the
nightmare
that
men
have
made
of
life
on
gods
beautiful
earth
i
have
been
through
more
of
it
my
good
renny
rens
brain
was
never
equal
to
coping
with
his
masters
periodic
fits
of
pessimism
though
he
well
knew
their
first
and
everpresent
cause
in
a
troubled
way
he
looked
about
the
room
so
peaceful
so
retired
and
studious
and
sir
adrian
understood
yes
yes
you
are
right
i
have
cut
off
the
old
life
he
made
answer
to
the
unspoken
expostulation
and
that
i
can
live
in
my
own
small
world
without
foregoing
all
my
duties
i
owe
to
you
my
good
friend
but
startling
news
like
this
brings
back
the
past
very
livingly
dead
though
it
bedead
ren
hesitated
he
was
pondering
over
the
advisability
of
disburdening
himself
of
yet
another
strange
item
of
information
he
had
in
reserve
but
as
his
master
rousing
himself
with
an
effort
as
if
to
dismiss
some
haunting
thought
turned
round
again
to
the
table
he
decided
that
the
moment
was
not
propitious
so
you
have
seen
to
all
these
things
said
sir
adrian
wearily
good
i
will
look
over
them
he
touched
the
neat
pile
of
books
and
papers
listlessly
as
he
spoke
yet
instead
of
sitting
down
remained
as
he
was
with
eyes
that
had
grown
wondering
staring
out
across
the
sea
look
he
said
presently
in
a
low
voice
and
ren
noticed

rare
flush
of

to
the
thin

we
both

listen
the
wind
is
coming
up
as
it
did
then
and
look
at
yonder
sky
and
taking
the
man
by
the
arm
he
advanced
slowly
with
him
towards
the
window
in
the
west
the
heavens
on
the
horizon
had
grown
threateningly
dark
but
under
the
aweinspiring
slatecoloured
canopy
of
clouds
there
opened
a
broad
archway
filled
with
primrose
lightthe
luminous
arch
well
known
to
seafarers
through
which
charge
the
furious
southwestern
squalls
the
rushing
of
the
storm
was
already
visible
in
the
distance
over
the
grey
waters
which
having
been
swayed
for
days
by
a
steady
aquilon
were
now
lashed
in
flank
by
the
sudden
change
of
wind
the
two
men
looked
out
for
a
while
in
silence
at
the
spectacle
of
the
coming
storm
in
the
servants
mind
ran
various
trivial
thoughts
bearing
on
the
presentwhat
a
lucky
matter
it
was
that
he
should
have
returned
in
time
only
just
in
time
it
was
from
the
angry
look
of
the
outer
world
the
island
would
now
for
many
a
day
be
besieged
by
seas
impassable
to
such
small
craft
as
alone
could
reach
the
reef
had
he
tarried
but
to
the
next
tide
and
how
sorely
he
had
been
tempted
to
remain
an
hour
more
in
the
gatekeepers
lodge
within
sight
and
hearing
of
buxom
moggie
margerys
granddaughter
had
he
missed
the
tide
for
days
maybe
for
weeks
would
the
master
have
had
to
watch
and
tend
alone
the
beacon
fire
but
here
he
was
and
all
was
well
and
he
had
still
the
marvellous
news
to
tell
should
he
tell
them
now
no
the
master
was

one
of
his

in

no

that
past
that
terminated
on
such
a

as
this

sir

with
eyes
fixed
on
the
widening
arch

a
dreamy
student
living
in
one
of
those
venerable
colleges
on
the
cam
the
very
atmosphere
of
which
would
seem
sufficient
to
glorify
the
merits
of
past
ages
and
past
institutions
amidst
such
peaceful
surroundings

ancient

had
produced
many
a
hardy
fighter

society

prejudiced

as
all
privileged

are
bound

had
nevertheless
drifted
resistlessly
towards
that
unfathomable
sea
whither
a
love
for
the
abstract
beautiful
a
yearning
for
superearthly
harmony
and
justice
must
inevitably
waft
a
young
intelligence
as
the
academical
years
glided
over
him
he
accumulated
much
classical
lore
withal
read
much
latterday
philosophy
and
developed
a
fine
youthful
theoretical
love
for
the
new
humanitarianism
he
dipped
sthetically
into
science
wherein
he
found
a
dim
kind
of
help
towards
a
more
recondite
appreciation
of
the
beauties
of
nature
his
was
not
a
mind
to
delight
in
profound
knowledge
but
rather
in
intellectual
cream
he
solaced
himself
with
essays
that
would
have
been
voted
brilliant
had
they
dealt
with
things
less
extravagant
than
universal
harmony
and
fraternal
happiness
with
verses
that
all
admitted
to
be
highly
polished
and
melodious
but
something
too
mystical
in
meaning
for
the
understanding
of
an
everyday
world
with
music
whereof
he
was
conceded

this
is
saying
that
adrian
landale
for
all
his
array
of
definite
accomplishments
which
might
have
been
a
neverfailing
source
of
interest
in
an
easy
existence
was
fitted
in
a
singularly
unfortunate
manner
for
the
life
into
which
one
sudden
turn
of
fortunes
wheel
unexpectedly
launched
him
during
the
short
halcyon
days
of
his
opening
independence
however
he
was
able
to
make
himself
the
centre
of
such
a
world
as
he
would
have
loved
to
live
in
he
was
not
of
course
generally
popular
either
at
college
or
at
home
nor
yet
in
town
except
among
that
small
set
in
whose
midst
he
inevitably
found
his
way
wherever
he
went
his
inferiors
in
social
status
perhaps
these
chosen
friends
of
his
but
their
lofty
enthusiasms
were
both
appreciative
of
and
congenial
to
his
own
most
of
them
indeed
came
in
afterlife
to
add
their
names
to
englands
roll
of
intellectual
fame
partly
because
they
had
that
in
them
which
adrian
loathed
as
unlovelythe
instinct
and
will
of
strife
partly
it
must
be
added
because
they
remained
free
in
their
circumstances
to
follow
the
lead
of
their
nature
which
freedom
was
not
allotted
to
him





on
one
magnificent
frosty
afternoon
early
in
the
year
1794
the
london
coach
deposited
adrian
landale
in
front
of
the
best
hostelry
in
lancaster
after
more
than
a
years
separation
from
his
family
this
separation
was
not
due
to
estrangement
but
rather
to
the
instigation
of
his
own
sire
sir
thomasa
gentleman
of
the
fine
old
schoolwho
exasperated
by
the
to
him
incomprehensible
and
insupportable
turn
of
mind
developed
by
his
heir
whom
he
loved
well
enough
notwithstanding
in
his
own
way
had
hoped
in
good
utilitarian
fashion
that
a
prolonged
period
of
contact
with
the
world
lubricated
by
a
plentiful
supply
of
money
might
shake
his
big
sawney
of
a

out
of

the
downright
old
baronet

even

in
an
unformed
sort
of
way
to

his
successor

to

to
the
paternal
hearth
the
richer
for
a
few
gentlemanly

provided
he
left
his
nonsense
behind
him
as
the
great
lumbering
vehicle
upon
the
box

of
which

the
young
traveller

in
dreamy
speculation
according
to
his
wont
drew
clattering
to
a
halt
he
failed
at
first
to
notice
the
central
figure
in
the
midst
of
the
usual
expectant
crowd
of
inn
guests
and
inn
retainers
called
forward
by
the
triumphant
trumpeting
which
heralds
the
approach
of
the
mail
there
however
stood
the
squire
of
pulwick
sir
tummus
himself
in
portly
and
jovial
importance
the
fathers
eyes
bright
and
piercing
under
his
bushy
white
brows
had
already
detected
his
boy
from
a
distance
and
they
twinkled
as
he
took
note
with
all
the
pride
of
an
author
in
his
work
of
the
symmetry
of
limb
and
shoulders
set
forth
by
the
youths
faultless
attireand
the
dress
of
men
in
the
old
years
of
the
century
was
indeed
calculated
to
display
a
figure
to
advantageof
the
lightness
and
grace
of
his
frame
as
he
dismounted
from
his
perch
in
short
of
the
increased
manliness
of
his
looks
and
bearing
but
a
transient
frown
soon
came
to
overshade
sir
thomass
ruddy
content
as
he
descried
the
deep
flush
an
old
weakness
which
mantled
the
young
cheeks
under
the
spur
of
unexpected
recognition
and
when
later
the
pair
emerged
from
the
inn
after
an
hours
conversation
over
a
bottle
of
burnt
sherryconversation
which
upon
the
fathers
side
had
borne
in
truth
much
the
character
of
crossexaminationto
mount
the
phaeton
with
which
a
pair
of
highmettled
bays
were
impatiently
waiting
the
return
homewards
there
was
a
very
definite
look
of
mutual
dissatisfaction
to
be
read
upon
their
countenances
whiling
away
the
time
in
fitful
constrained
talk
parcelled
out
by
long
silences
they
drove
again
through
the
gorgeous
frostspeckled
scenery
of
rocky
lands
until
the
sheen
of
the
great
bay
suddenly
peered
between
two
distant
scars
proclaiming
the
approach
to
the
pulwick
estate
the
father
then
broke
a
long
spell
of
muteness
and
thus
to
his
son
in
his
ringing
country
tones
as
if
pursuing
aloud
the
tenor
of
his
thoughts
harkee
master
adrian
said
he
that
you
are
now
a
man
of
parts
as
they
say
i
can
quite
see
you
seem
to
have
read
a
powerful
lot
of
things
that
do
not
come
our
way
up
here
but
let
us
understand
each
other
i
cannot
make
head
or
tail
of
these
farfetched
newfangle
notions
you
somehow
or
other
have
fallen
in
love
withyour
james
fox
your
wilberforce
your
adam
smith
they
may
be
very
fine
fellows
but
to
my
humble
thinking
theyre
but
a
pack
of
traitors
to
king
and
country
when
all
is
said
and
done
all
this
does
not
suit
an
english
gentleman
you
think
differently
or
perhaps
you
do
not
care
whether
it
does
or
not
i
admit
i
cant
hold
forth
as
you
do
nor
string
a
lot
of
fine
words
together
i
am
only
an
old
nincompoop
compared
to
a
clever
young
spark
like
you
but
i
request
you
to
keep
off
these
topics
in
the
company
i
like
to
see
round
my
table
they
dont
like
jacobins
you
know
no
more
do
i
nor
do
i
said
adrian
fervently
nor
do
you
dont
you
sir
dont
you
why
then
what
the
devil
have
you
been
driving
at
i
am
afraid
sir
you
do
not
understand
my
views
well
never
mind
i
dont
like
em
thats
short
and
if
you
bring
them
out
before

come
off

my
lad
great
man
as
you
are
and
so
i
warn
you
in
tones
as
unconcerned
as
he
could
render
them
the
young
man
sought
to
turn
the
intercourse
to
less
personal
topics
by
inquiring
further
anent
this
unknown
cousin
whose
very
name
was
strange
to
him
sir
thomas
easily
placable
if
easily
roused
started
willingly
enough
on
a
congenial
topic
and
thus
adrian
conceived
his
first
impression
of
that
romantic
being
whose
deeds
have
remained
legendary
in
the
french
west
country
and
who
was
destined
to
exercise
so
strong
an
influence
upon
his
own
life
who
is

she
is
french
all
the

by

of
the
sort
which
would
reconcile
even
an
englishman
with
the

sir
thomass
eyes
sparkled
with
enthusiasm
his
son
examined
him
with
grave
wonder
the
very
sight
of
her
my
boy
is
enough
to
make
a
mans
heart
warm

she

look
of
polite

fighting
the
republican
rapscallions
dn
them
and
thrashing
them
too
yonder
in
his
country
she
stuck
by
his
side
ay
like
a
good
plucked
one
she
did
until
it
became
palpable
that
if
there
was
to
be
a
son
and
heir
to
the
name
she
had
better
go
and
attend
to
its
coming
somewhere
else
in
peace
ho
ho
ho
well
england
was
the
safest
place
of
course
and
for
her
the
natural
one
she
came
and
offered
herself
to
us
on
the
plea
of
relationship
i
was
rather
taken
aback
at
first
i
own
but
gad
boy
when
i
saw
the
woman
after
hearing
what
she
had
had
to
go
through
to
reach
us
at
all
i
sang
another
song
well
she
is
a
fine
creaturefiner
than
ever
now
that
the
progeny
has
been
satisfactorily
hatched
a
brace
of
girls
instead
of
the
son
and
heir
after
all
two
of
them
no
less
ho
ho
ho
and
she
was
furious
the
pretty
dear
however
youll
soon
see
for
yourself
you
will
see
a
woman
sir
who
has
loaded
and
fired
cannon
with
her
own
hands
when
the
last
man
to
serve
it
had
been
shot
ay
and
more
than
that
my
ladshes
brained
a
hulking
sansculotte
that
was
about
to
pin
her
servant
to
the
floor
the
lad
has
told
me
so
himself
and
i
daresay
he
can
tell
you
more
if
you
care
to
practise
your
french
with
master
ren
laptre
thats
the
fellow
a
woman
who
sticks
to
her
lord
and
master
in
mud
and
powdersmoke
until
there
is
precious
little
time
to
spare
when
she
makes
straight
for
a
strange
land
in
a
fishingsmack
with
no
other
protector
than
a
peasant
and
now
with
an
imp
of
a
blackeyed
infant
to
her
breast
sally
mearsons
got
the
other
you
remember
sally
your
own
nurses
daughter
looks
like
a
chit
of
seventeen
thats
what
youll
see
sir
and
when
she
sails
downstairs
for
dinner
dressed
up
powdered
and
highheeled
she
might
be
a
princess
a
queen
who
has
never
felt
a
crumpled
roseleaf
in
her
life
gad
im
getting
poetical
i
declare
in
this
strain
did
the
squire
guiding
his
horses
with
strong
dexterous
hand
expatiate
to
his
son
the
crisp
air
rushing
past
them
making
their
faces
glow
with
the
tingling
blood
until
burning
the
ground
they
dashed
up
the
avenue
that
leads
to
the
white
mansion
of
pulwick
and
halted
amidst
a
cloud
of
steam
before
its
palladian
portico
what
happened
to
adrian
the
moment
after
happens
as
a
rule
only
once
in
a
mans
lifetime
through
the
opening
portals
the
guest
whose
condensed
biography
the
squire
had
been
imparting
to
his
son
all
unconsciously
eliciting
thereby
more
repulsion
than
admiration
in
the
breast
of
that
fastidious
young
misogynist
appeared
herself
to
welcome
the
return
of
her
host
adrian
as
he
retired
a
pace
to
let
his
father
ascend
the
steps
first
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
miraculously
small
and
arched
foot
clad
in
pink
silk
and
looking
suddenly
up
met
fully
the
flash
of
great
dark
eyes
set
in
a
small
white
face
more
brilliant
in
their
immense
blackness
than
even
the
glinting
icicles
pendant
over
the
lintel
that
now
shot
back
the
suns
sinking
glory
the
spell
was
of
the
kind
that
the
reason
of
man
can
never
sanction
and
yet
that
have
been
ever
and
will
be
while
man
is
this
youth
virgin
of
heart
dreamy
of
head
who
had
drifted
to
his
twentieth
year
all
unscathed
by
passion
or
desire
because
he
had
never
met
aught
in
flesh
and
blood
answering
to
his
unconscious
ideal
was
struck
to
the
depth
of
his
soul
by
the
presence
of
one
as
unlike
this
same
ideal
as
any
living
creature
could
be
struck
with
fantastic
suddenness
and
in
that
allencompassing
manner
which
seizes
the
innermost
fibres
of
the
being
it
was
a
pang
of
pain
but
a
revelation
of
glory
he
stood
for
some
moments
with
paling
cheeks
and
hotlybeating
heart
gazing
back
into
the
wondrous
eyes
she
yielding
her
cheek
carelessly
to
the
squires
hearty
kiss
examined
the
newcomer
curiously
the
while
whyhow
now
tut
tut
whats
this
thundered
the
father
who
following
the
direction
of
her
eyes
wheeled
round
suddenly
to
discover
his
sons
strange
bearing
have
you
lost
all
the
manners
as
well
as
the
notions
of
a
gentleman
these
last
two
years
speak
to
madame
de
savenaye
sirccile
this
is
my
son
pray
forgive
him
my
dear
the
fellows
shyness
before
ladies
is
inconceivable
it
makes
a
perfect
fool
of
him
as
you
see
but
madame
de
savenayes
finer
wits
had
already
perceived
something
different
from
the
ordinary
display
of
english
shyness
in
the
young
man
whose
eyes
remained
fixed
on
her
face
with
an
intentness
that
savoured
in
no
way
of
awkwardness
she
now
broke
the
spell
with
a
broader
smile
and
a
word
of
greeting
you
are
surprised
said
she
in
tripping
words
tinged
with
a
distinct
foreign
intonation
to
see
a
strange
face
here
mr
adrianor
shall
i
say
cousin
for
that
is
the
style
i
should
adopt
in
my
brittany
yes
you
see
in
me
a
poor
foreign
cousin
fleeing
for
protection
to
your
noble
country
how
do
you
do
my
cousin
she
extended
a
slender
white
hand
one
rosy
nail
of
which
bending
low
adrian
gravely
kissed
mais
comment
donc
exclaimed
the
lady
my
dear
uncle
did
you
chide
your
son
just
now
why
but
these
are
versailles
mannersso
gallant
so
courtly
and
she
gave
the
boys
fingers
as
they
lingered
under
hers
first
a
discreet
little
pressure
and
then
a
swift
flip
aside
ah
how
cold
you
are
she
exclaimed
and
then
laughing
added
sweetly
cold
hands
warm
heart
of
course
and
with
rapping
heels
she
turned
into
the
great
hall
and
into
the
drawingroom
whither
the
two
menthe
father
all
chuckles
and
the
son
still
struck
with
wonderfollowed
her
she
was
standing
by
the
hearth
holding
each
foot
alternately
to
the
great
logs
flaming
on
the
tiles
ever
and
anon
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
adrian
who
had
advanced
closer
without
selfconsciousness
but
still
in
silence
now
cousin
she
remarked
gaily
there
is
room
for
you
here
big
as
you
are
to
warm
yourself
you
must
be
cold
i
know
already
all
about
your
family
and
i
must
know
all
about
you
too
i
am
very
curious
i
find
them
all
such
good
kind
handsome
people
here
and
i
am
told
to
expect
in
you
something
quite
different
from
any
of
them
now
where
does
the
difference
come
in
you
are
as
tall
as
your
father
but
in
faceno
i
believe
it
is
your
pretty
sisters
you
are
like
in
face
here
the
squire
interrupted
with
his
loud
laugh
and
clapping
his
hand
on
his
stalwart
sons
head
you
have
just
hit
it
ccile
its
here
the
difference
lies
adrian
i
really
believe
is
a
little
mistake
of
dame
nature
his
brain
was
meant
for
a
girl
and
was
tacked
on
to
that
big
body
by
accident
ho
ho
ho
he
is
quite
ladylike
in
his
accomplishmentsloves
music
and
plays
by
gad
better
than
our
organist
writes
poetry
too
i
found
some
devilish
queer
things
on
his
writingtable
once
which
were
not
all
latin
verses
though
he
would
fain
i
thought
so
and
as
for
deportment
madame
ccile
why
there
is
more
propriety
in
that
hobbedehoy
at
least
more
blushing
in
him
than
in
all
the
breadandbutter
misses
in
the
county
adrian
said
nothing
but
when
not
turned
towards
the
ground
his
gaze
still
sought
the
countess
who
now
returned
the
look
with
a
ripening
smile
open
to
any
interpretation
surely
she
remarked
glancing
then
at
the
elder
for
an
instant
with
some
archness
surely
you
english
gentlemen
who
have
so
much
propriety
would
not
rather

there
was
young
mr
bradbury
we
heard
talked
of
yesterday
whom
every
farmer
with
a
redcheeked
lass
of
his
own
no
no
hastily
interrupted
the
baronet
with
a
blush
himself
while
adrians
cheek
in
spite
of
the
recent
indictment
preserved
its
smooth
pallorin
truth
the
boy
lost
in
his
first
lovedream
had
not
understood
the
allusion
no
i
dont
want
a
landale
to
be
a
blackguard
you
know
but
and
the
father
unable
to
split
this
ethical
hair
to
logical
satisfaction
stopped
and
entered
another
channel
of
grumbling
vituperation
whilst
the
countess
very
much
amused
by
her
private
thoughts
gave
a
little
rippling
laugh
and
resumed
her
indulgent
contemplation
of
the
accused
what
a
pity
now
schoolboy
rupert
is
not
the
eldest
there
would
be
a
country
gentleman
for
you
whereas
this
successor
that
is
to
be
of
mine
is
a
man
of
books
and
a
philosopher
forsooth
a
firstclass
bookworm
by
gad
i
believe
the
first
of
our
race
and
he
might
make
a
name
for
himself
ive
been
told
among
that
lot
though
the
pack
o
nonsense
he
treats
us
to
at
times
cannot
im
thinking
really
go
down
even
among
those
college
fuzzleheads
but
i
am
confounded
if
that
chap
will
ever
be
of
any
use
as
a
landlord
whenever
he
steps
into
my
shoes
he
hates
a
gun
and
takes
more
pleasurewhat
was
it
he
said
last
time
he
was
hereoh
yes
more
pleasure
in
watching
a
bird
dart
in
the
blue
than
bringing
it
down
be
it
never
so
neat
a
shot
ho
ho
did
ye
ever
hear
such
a
thing
and
though
he
can
sit
a
horsei
will
say
that
for
him
i
should
like
to
see
a
landale
that
could
noti
have
seen
this
big
boy
of
mine
positively
sicken
ay
and
scandalise
the
hunt
by
riding
away
from
the
death
moreover
i
believe
that
when
i
am
gone
he
will
always
let
off
any
poaching
scoundrel
on
the
plea
that
the
vermin
only
take
for
their
necessity
what
we
preserve
for
sport
the
little
foreign
lady
smiling
no
longer
eyed
her
big
cousin
with
wondering
looks
strange
indeed
she
remarked
that
a
man
should
fail
to
appreciate
the
boon
of
mans
existence
the
strength
and
freedom
to
dominate
to
be
up
and
doing
to
live
in
fact
how
i
should
long
to
be
a
man
myself
if
i
ever
allowed
myself
to
long
for
anything
but
i
am
a
woman
as
you
see
she
added
rising
to
the
full
height
of
her
exquisite
figure
and
must
submit
to
womans
lotand
that
is
just
now
to
the
point
for
i
must
leave
you
to
go
and
see
to
the
wants
of
that
mioche
of
mine
which
i
hear
whining
upstairs
but
i
do
not
believe
my
uncles
account
of
you
is
a
complete
picture
after
all
cousin
adrian
i
shall
get
it
out
of
you
anon
catechise
you
in
my
own
way
and
if
needs
be
convert
you
to
a
proper
sense
of
the
glorious
privileges
of
your
sex
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
well
my
lad
said
sir
thomas
that
evening
when
the
ladies
had
left
the
two
men
to
their
decanter
i
thought
my
frenchwoman
would
wake
you
up
but
by
george
i
hardly
expected
she
would
knock
you
all
of
a
heap
so
quick
hey
youre
winged
adrian
winged
or
this
is
not
port
i
cannot
say
sir
answered
adrian
musing
the
old
man
caught
up
the
unsatisfactory
reply
in
an
exasperated
burlesque
of
mimicry
i
cannot
say
siryou
cannot
say
pooh
pooh
there
is
no
shame
in
being
in
love
with
her
we
all
are
more
or
less
pass
the
bottle
as
for
you
since
you
clapped
eyes
on
her
you
have
been
like
a
man
in
the
moon
not
a
word
to
throw
to
a
dog
no
eyes
no
ears
but
for
your
own
thoughts
so
long
as
madam
is
not
there
enter
madam
youre
alive
again
by
george
and
pretty
lively
too
gad
i
never
thought
id
ever
see
you
do
the
ladys
man
all
in
your
own
queer
way
of
course
but
hang
it
all
she
seems
to
like
it
the
little
minx
ay
and
if
she
has
plenty
of
smiles
for
the
old
man
shes
ready
to
give
her
earnest
to
youi
saw
her
i
saw
her
but
dont
you
forget
shes
married
sir
very
much
married
too
she
dont
forget
it
either
i
can
tell
you
though
you
may
think
she
does
now
what
sort
of
game
is
she
making
of
you
what
were
you
talking
about
in
the
picture
gallery
for
an
hour
before
dinner
eh
to
say
the
truth
answered
the
son
simply
it
was
about
myself
almost
the
whole
time
and
she
flattered
you
finely
ill
be
bound
of
course
said
his
elder
with
a
knowing
look
oh
these
women
these
women
on
the
contrary
sir
she
thinks
even
less
of
me
than
you
do
that
woman
has
the
soul
of
a
savage
we
have
not
one
thought
in
common
the
father
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
a
pretty
savage
to
look
at
anyhow
a
wellpolished
one
in
the
bargain
ho
ho
ho
well
well
i
must
make
up
my
mind
i
suppose
that
my
eldest
son
is
a
lunatic
in
love
with
a
savage
adrian
remained
silent
for
a
while
toying
with
his
glass
his
young
brow
contracted
under
a
painful
frown
at
length
checking
a
sigh
he
answered
with
deliberation
since
it
is
so
palpable
to
others
i
suppose
it
must
be
love
as
you
say
i
had
thought
hitherto
that
love
of
which
people
talk
so
much
was
a
feeling
of
sweetness
what
i
feel
in
this
ladys
presence
is
much
more
kin
to
anguish
for
all
that
as
you
have
noticed
i
appear
to
live
only
when
she
is
nigh
the
father
looked
at
his
son
and
gaped
the
latter
went
on
after
another
pause
i
suppose
it
is
so
and
may
as
well
own
it
to
myself
and
to
you
though
nothing
can
come
of
it
good
or
bad
she
is
married
and
she
is
your
guest
and
even
if
any
thought
concerning
me
could
enter
her
heart
the
merest
show
of
love
on
my
part
would
be
an
insult
to
her
and
treason
to
you
but
trust
me
i
shall
now
be
on
my
guard
since
my
behaviour
has
already
appeared
strange
tut
tut
said
the
baronet
turning
to
his
wine
in
some
dudgeon
his
rubicund
face
clouding
as
he
looked
with
disfavour
at
this
strange
heir
of
his
who
could
not
even
fall
in
love
like
the
rest
of
his
race
what
are
you
talking
about
come
get
out
of
that
and
see
what
the
little
ladys
about
and
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
shell
not
compromise
herself
with
a
zany
like
you
anyhow
that
ill
warrant
but
adrian
with
all
the
earnestness
of
his
nature
and
his
very
young
fears
was
strenuously
resolved
to
watch
himself
narrowly
in
his
intercourse
with
his
too
fascinating
relative
little
recking
how
infinitesimal
is
the
power
of
a
mans
freewill
upon
the
conduct
of
his
life
the
next
morning
found
the
little
countess
in
the
highest
spirits
particularly
good
news
had
arrived
from
her
land
with
the
early
courier
true
the
news
were
more
than
ten
days
old
but
she
had
that
insuperable
buoyancy
of
hopefulness
which
attends
active
and
healthy
natures
the
breton
peasants
she
explained
to
the
company
round
the
breakfast
table
headed
by
their
lords
among
whom
was
her
own
seigneur
et
matre
had
again
crushed
the
swarms
of
ragged
brigands
that
called
themselves
soldiers
from
all
accounts
there
was
no
hope
for
the
latter
their
atrocities
had
been
such
that
the
whole
land
from
normandy
to
guyenne
was
now
in
arms
against
them
and
in
paris
the
hot
pit
whence
had
issued
the
storm
of
foulness
that
blasted
the
fair
kingdom
of
france
after
laying
low
the
hallowed
heads
of
a
good
king
and
a
beautiful
queen
in
paris
leaders
and
led
were
now
chopping
each
others
heads
off

those
thinkers
those
lofty
patriots
hein
beau
cousin
for
whom
it
seems
you
have
an
admiration
commented
the
lady
interrupting
her
account
to
sip
her
cup
of
cream
and
chocolate
with
a
little
finger
daintily
cocked
and
shoot
a
mocking
shaft
at
the
young
philosopher
from
the
depth
of
her
black
eyes
like
demented
wolves
they
are
destroying
each
otherpray
the
god
of
justice
quoted
she
from
her
husbands
letter
that
it
may
only
last
in
a
few
months
then
there
will
be
none
of
them
left
and
the
people
relieved
from
this
rule
of
blood
will
all
clamour
for
the
true
order
of
things
and
the
poor
country
may
again
know
peace
and
happiness
meanwhile
all
has
yet
to
be
won
by
much
devotion
and
selfsacrifice
in
the
cause
of
god
and
king
and
afterwards
will
come
the
reward
and
the
revenge
added
madame
de
savenaye
with
a
little
fierce
laugh
folding
the
sanguine
budget
of
news
oh
they
must
leave
us
a
few
for
revenge
how
we
shall
make
the
hounds
smart
when
the
king
returns
to
his
own
and
then
for
pleasures
and
for
life
again
and
we
may
yet
meet
at
the
mansion
of
savenaye
in
paris
she
went
on
gaily
my
good
uncle
and
fair
cousins
for
the
king
cannot
fail
to
recall
his
faithful
supporter
and
there
will
be
feasts
and
balls
and
there
maybe
we
shall
be
able
to
repay
in
part
some
of
your
kindness
and
hospitality
and
you
cousin
adrian
you
will
have
to
take
me
through
pavanne
and
gavotte
and
minuet
and
i
shall
be
proud
of
my
northern
cavalier
what
not

how

dances

what

way
with
a
grace
if
you
please
making
a
profound
curtsey
ah
still
that
cold
hand
your

your

look
round
at
your
partner

srieuse
that
she
saw
admiration
serious
enough
in
all
conscience
in
adrians
eyes
there
was
little
doubt
with
sombre
heart
he
failed
not
to
mark
every
point
of
this
allhuman
grace
but
to
him
goddesslike
beauty
the
triumph
and
glory
of
youth
the
coy
dainty
poise
of
the
adorable
footpointed

treading
the
ground
with
the
softness
of
a
kitten
at
play
the
maddening
curve
of
her
waist
which
a
sacque
depending
from
an
exquisite
nape
partly
concealed
only
to
enhance
its
lithe
suppleness
the
divinely
young
throat
and
bust
and
above
all
the
dazzling
black
rays
from
eyes
alternately
mocking
fierce

caressing

might
his
hand
be
cold
with
all
his
young
untried
blood
biting
at
his
heart
singing
in
his
head
why
did
god
place
such
creatures
on

earth

take
all

fair

i
said

i
did
not
mean
you
to
look
as
if
you
were
taking
me
to
a
funeral
you
are
supposed
to
be
enjoying
yourself
you
know
the
youth
struggled
with
a
ghastly
smile
and
the
father
laughed
outright
but
madame
de
savenaye
checked
herself
into
gravity
once
more
alas
nous

she
said
and
relinquished
her

we
have
still
to
fight
for
it
oh
that
i
were
free
to
be
up
and
doing
the
impatient
exclamation
was
wrung
out
of
her
apparently
by
the
appearance
of
two
nurses
each
bearing
an
infant
in
long
white
robes
for
the
mothers
inspection
a
preliminary
to

daily
outing

elder
of
these
matrons
was

old
nurse
who
much
occupied
with
her
new
duties
of
attendant
to
madame
de

and

of
her
babies

the

crossed

margery
at
the
soft
impeachment
as
she
delivered
over
the
minute
burden
her
daughter
in
honest
indignation
at
the

addressing

she
took
it
in

belying
her

by
the

exclaimed
the
master
of
the
house
with
sudden
sharpness
he
had
been
surveying
the
scene
from
the
hearthrug
chuckling
in
benevolent
amusement
at
little
madams
ways
yes
it
was
her
intention

explained
halting
in
her
walk
to
face
him
gravely
she
had
come
to
that
resolution
no

her

again
in

here
recollecting
himself
he
hesitated
and
started
upon
a
more
plausible
line
of
expostulation
pooh
pooh
you
cant

your

does
not
ask
you
to

does
he
in

with

authority
i

she
looked
up
with
a
smile
would
you
allow
your
friends
to
continue
fighting
alone
for
all
you
love
because
you
happened
to
be
in
safe
and
pleasant
circumstances

asked
then
she
added
ingenuously
i
have
heard
you
say
of
one
that
was
strong
of

and
staunch
to
his

for
all
these
poor
peasants
of
ours
to
see
their

remain
among
them
sharing
their

in

of
their

gazing

its

with
wistful

my

our

sir
thomas
with
an
inarticulate
growl
relapsed
into
silence
and
she
resumed
her
walk
with
bent
head
lost
in
thought
up
and
down
the
great
room
out
of
the
pale
winter
sunshine
into
the
shadow
and
back
again
to
the
tune
of

she
hummed
beneath
her
breath
while
the

in
its
white
cap
from
which
protruded
one
tiny
straight
wisp
of
brown
hair
with
its
beady
unseeing
black
eyes
and
its
round
mouth
dribbling
peacefully
bobbed
over
her
shoulder
as
she
went
adrian
stood
in
silence
too
following
her
with
his
eyes
while
the
picture
so
sweet
to
see
so
strange
to
one
who
knew
all
that
was
brewing
in
the
young
mothers
head
and
heart
stamped
itself
upon
his
brain
at
the
door
at
length
she
halted
a
moment
and
looked
at
them
both
yes
my
friends
she
said
and
her
eyes
shot
flame
i
must
go
soon
the

its

against

a
fair
emissary
many
guests
had
been
convened
to
the
hospitable
board
of
pulwick
upon
the
evening
which
followed
adrians
return
home
and
as
besides
the
fact
that
the
fame
of
the
french
lady
had
spread
enthusiasm
in
most
of
the
male
breasts
of
the
district
and
anxious
curiosity
in
gentler
bosoms
there
was
a
natural
neighbourly
desire
to
criticise
the
young
heir
of
the
house
after
his
years
absence
the
county
had
responded
in
a
body
to
the
invitation
it
was
a
goodly
company
therefore
that
was
assembled
in
the
great
withdrawing
rooms
when
the
countess
herself
came
tripping
down
the
shallow
oaken
stairs
and
found
adrian
waiting
for
her
in
the
hall
he
glanced
up
as
she
descended
towards
him
to
cover
her
with
an
ardent
look
and
feast
his
eyes
despairingly
on
her
beauty
and
she
halted
a
moment
to
return
his
gaze
with
a
light
but
meaning
air
of
chiding
cousin
she
said
you
have
very
singular
manners
for
one
supposed
to
be
so
shy
with
ladies
do
you
know
that
if
my
husband
were
here
to
notice
them
you
might
be
taken
to
task
adrian
ran
up
the
steps
to
meet
her
the
man
in
him
was
growing
apace
with
the
growth
of
a
mans
passion
and
by
the
boldness
of
his
answer
belying
all
his
recent
wise
resolutions
he
now
astonished
himself
even
more
than
her
you
are
going
back
to
him
he
said
with
halting
voice
all
is
wellfor
him
perhaps
for
you
for
us
who
remain
behind
there
is
nothing
left
but
the
bitterness
of
regretand
envy
then
in
silence
they
descended
together
as
they
were
crossing
the
hall
there
entered
suddenly
to
them

as
he
went

young
breton

the
lord
of

had
appointed
as
squire
to
his
lady
upon
her
travels
and
who
since
her
establishment
at
pulwick
had
been
sent
to
carry
news

money
back
to

on
his
haggard
countenance

of
disastrous
import
recent
tears
had
blurred
his
sunburnt
cheek
and
the
hand
that
tore
the
hat
from
his
head
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
his
mistress
partly
in
instinctive
humility
partly
it
seemed
to
conceal
some
papers
he
held
against
his
breast
twitched
with
nervous

around
like
a
hunted
animal
seeking
a
retreat
and
then
up
at
her
in
dumb
pleading
but
she
stamped
her
foot
and
held

to
the

the
imperiousness

repeated

drew
nearer
to

and
uneasy
at
her
nonappearance
opened
the

came
forward
anxiously
whilst
his

among

a
sense
that
something
of
importance
was

a
sigh
lifted
the
fair
young
bosom
but
she
showed
no
other
sign
of
weakness
indeed
those
who
watched
this
unexpected
scene
were
struck
by
the
contrast
between
the
bearing
of
this
young
almost
girlish
creature
who
holding
the
written
sheets
with
firm
hands
to
the
light
read
their
terrible
contents
with
dry
eyes
and
that
of
the
man
who
had
sunk
kneeling
at
her
feet
all
undone
to
have
had
the
bringing
of
the
news
the
silence
was
profound
save
for
the
crackling
of
the
pages
as
she
turned
them
over
and
an
occasional
longdrawn
sob
from
the
messenger
when
she
came
to

was

some
moments
absorbed
in
thought
absently
refolding
the
letter
into
its
original
neatness
then
her
eyes
fell
on
rens
prostrate
figure
and
she
stooped
to
lay
a
kind
hand
for
an
instant
on
his
shoulder

up
my
good

said
at
her
voice
and
touch

dragged
his

together

he
lifted
his
bloodshot
eyes
to
her
with
the
gaze
of
a
faithful
dog
in
distress
scraped
an
uncouth
bow
and
abruptly
turned
away
brushing
the
tears
from
his
cheek
with
his
sleeve
and
hurrying
to
relieve
his
choking
grief
in
solitude
she
stood
a
while
again
absorbed
in
her
own
reflection
and
of
those
who
would
have
rushed
to
speak
gentle
words
to
her
and
uphold
her
with
tender
hands
had
she
wept
or
swooned
there
was
none
who
dared
approach
this
grief
that
gave
no
sign
in
a
short
time
however
she
seemed
to
recollect
herself
and
awaken
to
the
consciousness
of

she
said
going
up
to
the
old
man
and
kissing
his
cheek
after
sweeping
the
assembled
company
with
dark
thoughtful
gaze
here

that

she
said
with
a
gleam
of
exaltation
in
her
eyes
then
added
after
a
pause
between
clenched
teeth

in
a
whisper

discomposed
and
fairly
at
a
loss
how
to
deal
with
the
stricken
woman
who
was
so
unlike
any
womankind
he
had
ever
yet
come
across
patted
her
hand
in
silence
placed
it
within
his
arm
and
quietly
led
her
into
the
drawingroom
rolling
as
he
did
so
uneasy
eyes
upon
his
guests
but
she
followed
the
current
of
her
thoughts
as
her
little
feet
kept
pace
beside

afresh
but
for
the
present

she
looked
round
the
room
and
her
eyes
rested
an
instant
upon
a
group
of
young
men
who
were
surveying
her
from
a
corner
with
mingled
admiration
and
awewe
that
is
ren
and
i
have
work

this
country
before
we
return
for
you
will
keep
us
a
little
longer
she
added
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
will
i
keep
you
a
little
longer
exclaimed
the
squire
hotly
will
i
ever
let
you
go
now
she
shook
her
head
at
him
with
something
of
her
natural
archness
then
turning
to
make
a
grave
curtsey
to
the
circle
of
ladies
around
her
i
and
my
misfortune
she
said
have
kept
your
company
and
your
dinner
waiting
i
hardly
know
how
long
no
doubt
in
their
kindness
they
will
forgive
me
and
accepting
again
her
uncles
arm
which
delighted
at
the
solution
of
the
present
difficulty
and
nodding
to
adrian
to
start
the
other
guests
he
hastened
to
offer
her
she
preceded
the
rest
into
the
dininghall
with
her
usual
alert
bearing
the
behaviour
of
the
countess
of
savenaye
had
affected
the
various
spectators
in
various
ways
the
male
sex
to
a
man
extolled
her
fortitude
the
ladies
however
condemned
such
unfeminine
strength
of
mind
while
the
more
charitable
prophesied
that
she
would
pay
dearly
for
this
unnatural
repression
and
the
whispered
remark
of
one
of
the
prettier
and
younger
damsels
that
the
loss
of
a
husband
did
not
seem
to
crush
her
at
any
rate
met
on
the
whole
with
covert
approval
as
for
adrian
who
shall
describe
the
tumult
of
his
soulthe
regret
the
hungering
over
her
in
her
sorrow
the
wild
unbidden
hopes
and
his
shame
of
them
careful
of
what
his
burning
eyes
might
reveal
he
hardly
dared
raise
them
from
the
ground
and
yet
to
keep
them
long
from
her
face
was
an
utter
impossibility
the
whispered
comments
of
the
young
men
behind
him
their
admiration
and
astonishment
drove
him
to
desperation
and
the
highnosed
dowager
whom
it
was
his
privilege
to
escort
to
his
fathers
table
arose
from
it
convinced
that
sir
thomass
heir
had
lost
in
his
travels
the
few
poor
wits
he
ever
possessed
the
dinner
that
evening
was
without
doubt
the
most
dismal
meal
the
neighbourhood
had
ever
sat
down
to
at
the
hospitable
board
of
pulwick
past
funeral
refections
not
excepted
the
host
quite
taken
up
with
his
little
foreign
relative
had
words
only
for
her
and
these
indeed
consisted
merely
in
fruitless
attempts
to
induce
her
to
partake
largely
of
every
courseremoves
relieves
sidedishes
joints
as
their
separate
turn
came
round
long
spells
of
silence
fell
upon
him
meantime
which
he
emphasised
by
lugubriously
clearing
his
throat
except
for
the
pretty
courtesy
with
which
she
would
answer
him
she
remained
lost
in
her
own
thoughtsever
and
anon
consulting
the
letter
which
lay
beside
her
to
fall
again
it
seemed
into
a
deeper
muse
but
never
a
tear
glinted
between
her
black
lashes
more
than
once
adrian
from
his
distant
end
of
the
table
met
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
for
a
moment
and
the
look
so
full
of
mysterious
meanings
made
his
heart
beat
in
anguish
expecting
he
knew
not
what
among
the
rest
of
the
assembly
part
deference
to
a
calamity
so
stoutly
borne
part
amazement
at
such
strange
ways
part
discomfort
at
their
positions
as
feasters
in
the
midst
of
mourning
had
reduced
conversation
to
the
merest
pretence
the
ladies
were
glad
enough
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
withdraw
nor
did
most
of
the
men
view
with
reluctance
a
moment
which
would
send
the
decanters
gliding
freely
over
the
mahogany
and
relieve
them
from
this
unwonted
restraint
madame
de
savenaye
had
however
other
interests
in
store
for
these
latter
she
rose
with
the
rest
of
the
ladies
but
halted
at
the
door
and
laying
her
hand
upon
her
uncles
arm
said
an
earnest
word
in
his
ear
in
obedience
to
which
he
bundled
out
his
daughters
as
they
hung
back
politely
closed
the
door
upon
the
last
skirt
and
reconducted
the
countess
to
the
head
of
the
table
scratching
his
chin
in
some
perplexity
but
ready
to
humour
her
slightest
whim
she
stood
at
her
former
place
and
looked
for
a
moment
in
silence
from
one
to
another
of
the
faces
turned
with
different
expressions
of
astonishment
and
anticipation
towards
herruddy
faces
most
of
them
young
or
old
handsome
or
homely
the
honest
english
stamp
upon
each
and
distinct
from
them
all
adrians
pallid
thoughtful
features
and
his
ardent
eyes
upon
him
her
gaze
rested
the
longest
then
with
a
little
wave
of
her
hand
she
prayed
them
to
be
seated
and
waited
to
begin
her
say
until
the
wine
had
passed
round
gentlemen
then
quoth
she
with
my
good
uncles
permission
i
shall
read
you
the
letter
which
i
have
this
night
received
so
that
english
gentlemen
may
learn
how
those
who
are
faithful
to
their
god
and
their
king
are
being
dealt
with
in
my
country
this
letter
is
from
monsieur
de
puisaye
one
of
the
most
active
partisans
of
the
royal
cause
a
connection
of
the
ancient
house
of
savenaye
and
he
begins
by
telling
me
of
the
unexpected
reverses
sustained
by
our
men
so
close
upon
their
successes
at
chateaugonthier
successes
that
had
raised
our
loyal
hopes
so
high
the
most
crushing
defeat
he
writes
has
taken
place
near
the
town
of
savenaye
itself
on
your
own
estate
and
your
historic
house
is
now
alas
in
ruins
during
the
last
obstinate
fight
your
husband
had
been
wounded
but
after
performing
prodigies
of
valoursuch
as
it
was
hoped
or
trusted
the
king
should
in
time
hear
ofhe
escaped
from
the
hands
of
his
enemies
for
many
weeks
with
a
few
hundred
followers
he
held
the
fields
in
the
marais
but
he
was
at
last
hemmed
in
and
captured
by
one
of
the
monster
thureaus
colonnes
infernales
those
hellish
legions
with
an
account
of
whose
deeds
so
says
this
gallant
gentleman
our
friend
i
will
not
defile
my
pen
but
whose
boasts
are
like
those
of
attila
the
hun
and
who
in
their
malice
have
invented
obscene
tortures
worthy
of
iroquois
savages
for
all
who
fall
into
their
clutches
be
they
men
women
or
children
but
by
heavens
mercy
dear
madame
says
m
de
puisaye
to
me
your
noble
husband
was
too
weak
to
afford
sport
to
those
demons
and
so
he
has
escaped
torment
he
was
hanged
with
all
speed
indeed
for
fear
he
might
die
first
of
his
toils
and
his
wounds
and
so
defeat
them
at
the
last
a
rustling
murmur
of
horror
and
indignation
went
round
the
table
but
the
little
woman
faced
the
audience
proudly
he
died
she
said
as
beseems
a
brave
man
but
this
is
not
all
i
had
a
sister
she
was
very
fairlike
me
some
people
said
in
looksshe
used
to
be
the
merry
one
at
home
in
the
days
of
peace
she
gave
a
little
smile
far
more
piteous
than
tears
would
beshe
chose
to
remain
among
her
people
when
they
were
fighting
to
help
the
wounded
the
sick
here
madame
de
savenaye
paused
a
moment
and
put
down
the
letter
from
which
she
had
been
reading
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
begun
to
speak
she
grew
pale
knitting
her
black
brows
and
with
downcast
eyes
she
went
on
monsieur
de
puisaye
says
he
asks
my
pardon
humbly
on
his
knees
for
writing
such
tidings
to
me
bereaved
as
i
am
of
all
i
hold
dear
but
it
is
meet
he
says
that
the
civilised
world
should
know
the
deeds
these
followers
of
liberty
and
enlightenment
have
wrought
upon
gallant
men
and
highborn
ladies
and
i
hold
that
he
says
well
she
flashed
once
more
her
black
gaze
round
upon
the
men
who
with
heads
all
turned
towards
her
and
forgetting
their
wine
hung
upon
her
words
it
is
right
that
i
should
know
and
you
too
it
is
meet
that
such
deeds
should
be
made
known
to
the
world
my
sister
was
taken
by
these
men
but
less
fortunate
than
my
husband
she
had
life
enough
left
for
tortureshe
too
is
dead
now
m
de
puisaye
adds
thank
god
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
say
toothank
god
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
as
she
ceased
speaking
broken
at
last
here
and
there
along
the
table
by
exclamations
and
groans
and
a
deep
execration
from
sir
thomas
which
was
echoed
deepmouthed
by
his
guests
adrian
himself
the
pacific
the
philosopher
with
both
arms
stretched
out
on
the
table
clenched
his
hands
and
set
his
teeth
and
gazed
into
space
with
murderous
looks
then
the
clear
young
voice
went
on
again
you
who

honoured

things
to

done
while

have
arms
to
strike

are
not
beaten

there
are
french

up
and
doing
so
long
as
they
have

had
risen
to
her
feet
the
blood
glowed
on
her
cheek
as
she
concluded
her
appeal
a
thousand
stars
danced
in
her
eyes
old
men
and
young

leapt
up
with

much
ardour

upon

when
the

had
succeeded
at
length
in
collecting
and

off
such
among
the
hiccupping
husbands

departing

prudently

upon
his
tall
sonfor
though
he
had
a
seasoned
head
the
nights
potations
had
been
deep
and
fierywas
startled
wellnigh
into
soberness
at
the
sight
of
his
niece
waiting
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
why
cis
my
love

long
while

you
been
then
since
you
ran
away
from
the
diningroom
by
george
chuckling
the
fellows
were
mad
to
get
another
glimpse
of
you
his
bloodshot
eye
hung
over
her
fondly
there
was
not
a
trace
of
fatigue
upon
that
delicate
pretty
face
i
wanted
to
thinki
have
much
to
think
on

was
sober
enough
at
any
rate
there

no
time

my
work

i
shall
not
rest
tonight
till
i
have
planned
it
in
my
head
surely
the
brilliancy
of
those
eyes
was
feverish
the
little
hands
she
laid
upon
them
to
draw
them
into
the
dimlit
library

hot
as

sir

fell
into
an
armchair

sank
on

the
firelight
playing
upon
her
eager
face
while
adrian
in
the
shadow

hours
ago
will
be
as
much
in
earnest
in
the
morning
why
dn
them
if
they
go
back
on
their
word
ill
call
them
out
thundered
sir
thomas
in
a
great
rage
all
of
a
sudden
she
surveyed
him
inquiringly
and
shot
a
swift
keen
glance
from
the
placid
bulky
figure
in
the
chair
to
adrian
pale
and
erect
behind
it
then
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
a
few
paces
off
as
it
were
pondering
what
is
now
required
of
mei
have
been
thinking
it
well
over
she
said
at
last
can
hardly
be
achieved
by
a
woman
alone
and
yet
with
proper
help
and
support
i
think
i
could
do
more
than
any
man
by
himself
there
is
that
in
a
womans
entreaties
which
will
win
when
a
man
may
fail
but
i
must
have
a
knight
at
my
side
a
protector
at
the
same
time
as
a
faithful
servant
these
are
not
the
times
to
stand
on
conventional
scruples
do
you
think
among
these
gentlemen
any
could
be
found
with
sufficient
enthusiasm
for
the
royal
cause
here
represented
by
me
to
attend
and
support
me
through
all
the
fatigues
the
endless
errands
the
interviewsay
also
the
rebuffs
the
ridicule
at
times
perhaps
the
danger
of
the
conjuration
which
must
be
set
on
foot
in
this
countryto
do
all
that
without
hope
of
other
reward
than
the
consciousness
of
helping
a
good
cause
andand
the
gratitude
of
one
who
may
have
nothing
else
to
give
she
stopped
with
a
little
nervous
laugh
no
it
is
absurd
no
man
on
reflection
would
enter
into
such
a
service
unless
it
were
for
his
own
country
as
the
last
words
fell
from
her
lips
she
suddenly
turned
to
adrian
and
met
his
earnest
gaze
or
for
his
kindred
said
the
young
man
coming
up
to
her
with
grave
simplicity
if
his
kindred
required
it
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
passed
across
her
face
the
father
who
had
caught
her
meaningsharp
enough
as
some
men
can
be
in
their
cupsnodded
his
head
with
great
vigour
yes
why
should
you
think
first
of
strangers
he
grumbled
when
you
have
your
own
blood
to
stand
by
youblood
is
thicker
than
water
aint
it
am
i
too
old
or

he
too
young
to
wait
on
youhey
madam
she
extended
her
hand
allowing
it
to
linger
in
adrians
grasp
whilst
she
laid
the
other
tenderly
on
the
old
mans
shoulder
my
good
uncle
my
kind
cousin
have
i
the
choice
already
between
two
such
cavaliers
i
am
fortunate
indeed
in
my
misfortune
in
other
circumstances
to
decide
would
be
difficult
between
two
men
each
so
good
but
she
added
after
a
moments
hesitation
and
looking
at
adrian
in
a
manner
that
made
the
young
mans
heart
beat
thickly
in
this
case
it
is
obvious
i
must
have
some
one
whom
i
need
not
fear
to
direct
ay
ay
muttered
the
baronet
id
go
with
you
my
darling
to
the
worlds
end
but
theres
that
young
philosopher
of
mine
breaking
his
heart
for
you
and
when
alls
said
and

its
the
young
fellow

be
the
most
use

more
luck
than

deserve
answered
madame
de
savenaye
smiling
upon
her
young
knight
as
taking
heart
of
grace
he
stooped
to
seal
the
treaty
upon
her
hand
to
say
the
truth
i
had
hoped
for
this
yet
hardly
dared
to
allow
myself
to
count
upon
it
and
really
uncle
you
give
your
own
son
to
my
causeand
you
cousin
you
are
willing
to
work
for
me
i
am
indeed
strengthened
at
the
outset
of
my
undertaking
i
shall
pray
that
you
may
never
have
cause
to
regret
your
chivalrous
goodness
she
dropped
adrians
hand
with
a
faint
pressure
and
moved
sighing
towards
the
door
do
you
wonder
that
i
have
no
tears
cousin
she
said
a
little
wistfully
they
must
gather
in
my
heart
till
i
have
time
to
sit
down
and
shed
them
thus
it
was
that
a
letter
penned
by
this
unknown
m
de
puisaye
from
some
hidden
fastness
in
the
bocage
of
brittany
came
to
divert
the
course
of
adrian
landales
existence
into
a
channel
where
neither
he
nor
any
of
those
who
knew
him
would
ever
have
dreamed
to
see
it
drift
chapter
v
the
awakening
oh
what
hadst
thou
to
do
with
cruel
death
who
wast
so
full
of
life

sir
adrian
landale
in
his
seagirt
fastness
still
absorbed
in
dreams
of
bygone
days
loosed
his
grasp
of
faithful
rens
shoulder
and
fell
to
pacing
the
chamber
with
sombre
mien
while
ren
to
whom
these
fits
of
abstraction
in
his
master
were
not
unfamiliar
but
yet
to
his
superstitious
peasant
soul
eerie
and
aweinspiring
visitations
slipped
unnoticed
from
his
presence
the
lightkeeper
sate
down
by
his
lonely
hearth
and
buried
his
gaze
in
the
glowing
woodembers
over
which
with
each
fitful
thundering
rush
of
wind
round
the
chimney
fluttered
little
eddies
of
silvery
ash
so
that
long
strife
was
over
which
had
wrought
such
havoc
to
the
world
had
shaped
so
dismally
the
course
of
his
own
life
the
monster
of
selfish
ambition
the
tyrannic
insatiable
conqueror
whose
very
existence
had
so
long
made
peaceable
pursuits
unprofitable
to
mankind
the
final
outcome
of
that
revolution
that
at
the
starting
point
had
boded
so
nobly
for
human
welfarehe
was
at
last
laid
low
and
all
the
misery
of
the
protracted
struggle
now
belonged
to
the
annals
of
the
past
it
was
all
overbut
the
waste
the
waste
of
life
and
happiness
far
and
wide
away
among
innocent
and
uninterested
beings
the
waste
remained
and
looking
back
on
it
the
most
bitter
portion
of
his
own
wrecked
life
was
the
short
time
he
had
yet
thought
happy
three
months
spent
as
knighterrant
how
far
they
seemed
far
as
irrevocable
youth
those
days
when
in
the
wake
of
that
lovecompelling
emissary
he
moved
from
intrigue
to
intrigue
among
the
migrs
in
london
and
their
english
sympathisers
to
bustling
yet
secret
activity
in
seafaring
parts
the
mechanical
instrument
directed
by
the
ingenious
mind
of
ccile
de
savenaye
the
discreet
minister
who
for
all
his
young
years
secured
the
help
of
some
important
political
sympathiser
one
day
scoured
the
country
for
arms
and
clothing
powder
and
assignats
another
who
treated
with
smuggling
captains
and
chartered
vessels
that
were
to
run
the
gauntlet
on
the
norman
and
breton
coast
and
supply
the
means
of
war
to
struggling
and
undaunted
loyalists
all
this
relentless
work
little
suited
on
the
whole
to
an
englishman
and
in
a
cause
the
rights
of
which
he
himself
had
up
to
then
refused
to
admit
was
then
repaid
a
hundredfold
by
a
look
of
gratitude
of
pleasure
even
a
few
sweet
moments
of
his
ladys
company
before
being
sent
hence
again
upon
some
fresh
enterprise
ah
how
he
loved
her
he
the
youth
on
the
threshold
of
manhood
who
had
never
known
passion
before
how
he
loved
this
young
widowed
mother
who
used
him
as
a
man
to
deal
for
her
with
men
yet
so
loftily
treated
him
as
a
boy
when
she
dealt
with
him
herself
and
if
he
loved
her
in
the
earlier
period
of
his
thraldom
when
scarce
would
he
see
her
one
hour
in
the
twentyfour
to
what
allencompassing
fervour
did
the
bootless
passion
rise
when
the
day
of
departure
having
dawned
and
sunk
he
found
himself
on
board
the
privateer
sailing
away
with
her
towards
unknown
warlike
ventures
her
knight
to
protect
her
her
servant
to
obey
on
all
these
things
mused
the
recluse
of
scarthey
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
past
the
spell
of
haunting
recollection
closing
on
him
as
he
sat
by
his
hearthside
whilst
the
increasing
fury
of
the
gale
toiled
and
troubled
outside
fighting
the
impassable
walls
of
his
tower
could
it
have
been
possible
that
shethe
only
woman
that
had
ever
existed
for
him
the
love
for
whom
had
so
distorted
his
mind
from
its
natural
sympathies
had
killed
in
him
the
spring
of
youth
and
the
savour
of
lifenever
really
learnt
to
love
him
in
return
till
the
last
and
yet
there
was
a
womans
soul
in
that
delicious
womans
bodyit
showed
itself
at
least
once
though
until
that
supreme
moment
of
union
and
parting
it
seemed
as
if
a
mans
mind
alone
governed
it
becoming
sterner
more
unbendable
as
hardships
and
difficulties
multiplied
in
the
melancholy
phantasm
passing
before
his
minds
eye
of
a
period
of
unprecedented
bloodshed
and
savagery
when
on
the
one
side
chouans
vendens
and
such
guerillas
of
which
madame
de
savenaye
was
the
moving
spirit
and
on
the
other
the
colonnes
infernales
of
the
revolutionary
leaders
vied
with
each
other
in
ferocity
and
cunning
she
stood
ever
foremost
ever
the
central
point
of
thought
with
a
vividness
that
almost
a
score
of
years
had
failed
to
dim
when
the
mood
was
upon
him
he
could
unfold
the
roll
of
that
story
buried
now
in
the
lonely
graves
of
the
many
or
in
the
fickle
memories
of
the
few
but
upon
his
soul
printed
in
letters
of
fire
and
bloodto
endure
for
ever
round
this
goddess
of
his
young
and
only
love
clustered
the
sole
impressions
of
the
outer
world
that
had
ever
stirred
his
heart
the
grandeur
of
the
ocean
of
the
storm
the
glory
of
sunrise
over
a
dishevelled
sea
the
ineffable
melancholy
of
twilight
rising
from
an
unknown
strand
then
the
solemn
coldness
of
moonlight
watches
the
scent
of
the
burnt
land
under
the
fierce
sun
when
all
nature
was
hushed
save
the
dreamy
buzz
of
insectlife
the
green
coolness
of
underwood
or
forest
the
unutterable
harmony
of
the
sighing
breeze
and
the
song
of
wild
birds
during
the
long
patient
ambushes
of
partisan
war
the
taste
of
bread
in
hunger
of
the
stream
in
the
fever
of
thirst
of
approaching
sleep
in
exhaustionand
mixed
with
these
the
acrid
emotions
of
fight
and
carnage
anguish
of
suspense
savage
exultation
of
victoryall
the
doings
of
a
life
which
he
bred
to
intellectual
pleasures
and
high
moral
ideas
would
have
deemed
a
nightmare
but
which
lived
as
it
was
in
the
atmosphere
of
his
longing
and
devotion
yet
held
for
him
a
strange
and
pungent
joy
a
cup
of
cruel
memories
yet
one
to
be
lingered
over
luxuriously
till
the
savour
of
each
cherished
drop
of
bitterness
be
gathered
to
the
uttermost
now
in
the
brightness
of
the
embers
between
the
fitful
flames
of
crumbling
wood
spreads
before
his
eyes
the
dreary
strand
near
quiberon
immense
in
the
gathering
darkness
of
a
boisterous
evening
well
hidden
under
the
stone
table
of
a
druidical
menhir
glows
a
small
campfire
sedulously
kept
alive
by
ren
for
the
service
of
the
lady
she
wrapped
up
in
a
coarse
peasantcloak
pensively
gazes
into
the
cheerless
smoke
and
holds
her
worn
and
muddy
boots
to
the
smouldering
wood
in
the
vain
hope
of
warmth
and
adrian
stands
silently
behind
her
brooding
on
many
thingson
the
vicissitudes
of
that
desultory
war
which
has
left
them
not
a
roof
whereunder
they
can
lay
their
heads
during
which
the
little
english
contingent
has
melted
from
them
one
by
one
on
the
critical
action
of
the
morrow
when
the
republican
columns
now
hastening
to
oppose
the
landing
of
the
great
royalist
expedition
to
quiberon
that
supreme
effort
upon
which
all
their
hopes
centre
must
be
surprised
and
cut
off
at
whatever
cost
on
the
mighty
doings
to
follow
which
are
to
complete
the
result
of
the
recent
sea
fight
off
ushant
and
crown
their
devoted
toil
with
victory
at
last
and
through
his
thoughts
he
watches
the
pretty
foot
in
its
hideous
disguise
of
patched
worn
illfitting
leather
and
he
sees
it
as
on
the
first
day
of
their
meeting
in
its
gleaming
slipper
and
dainty

of
unremitting

for
which
in
the
vast
silence
none
could
suspect
that
a
thousand
men
and
more
are
lying
stretched
upon
the

all
around
them
fireless
wellnigh
without

waiting

to

the

in

comes
closing

from
all
the
rest

even
ren
has
crept
away
to

perhaps
she
turns
at
last
towards
him
her
small
face
in
the
dying
light
of
this
sullen
evening
how
wan
and
weatherbeaten
pensive
as
usual
cousin
she
says
in
english
and
extends
her
hand
browned
and
scratched
that
was
once
so
exquisite
and
she
smiles
the
smile
of
a
dauntless
soul
from
a
weary
body
poor
little
hands
poor
little
feet
so
cold
so
battered
so
illused
he
who
would
have
warmed
them
in
his
bosom
given
his
heart
for
them
to
tread
upon
breaks
down
now
for
the
first
time
and
falling
on
his
knees
covers
the
cold
fingers
with
kisses
and
then
lays
his
lips
against
those
pitiful
torn
boots
but
she
spurns
him
from
hereven
from
her
feet
shame
on
you
she
says
angrily
and
adds
more
gently
yet
with
some
contempt
enfant
vais
this
the
time
for
such
follies
and
suddenly
recalled
to
honour
and
grim
actuality
he
realises
with
dismay
his
breach
of
trusthe
who
in
their
earlier
days
in
london
had
called
out
that
sprightly
little
migr
merely
for
the
vulgar
flippancy
aimed
in
compliment
too
at
the
grave
aidedecamp
that
the
fate
of
the
late
count
weighed
somewhat
lightly
upon
madame
de
savenaye
he
who
had
struck
that
too
literary
countryman
of
his
own
across
the
faceay
and
shot
him
in
the
shoulder
all
in
the
secret
early
dawn
of
the
day
they
left
englandfor
daring
to
remark
within
his
hearing
by
george
the
handsome
frenchwoman
and
her
cousin
may
be
a
little
less
than
kin
but
they
are
a
little
more
than
kind
but
yet
as
the
rage
of
love
contending
in
his
heart
with
selfreproach
he
rises
to
his
feet
in
shame
she
gives
him
her
hand
once
more
and
in
a
different
voice
courage
cousin
says
she
perhaps
some
day
we
may
both
have
our
reward
but
will
not
my
knight
continue
to
fight
for
my
bidding
even
without
hope
of
such
pondering
on
this
enigmatic
sentence
he
leaves
her
to
her
rest





when
next
he
finds
himself
by
her
side
the
anticipated
action
has
begun
and
it
is
to
be
the
last
day
that
those
beautiful
burning
eyes
shall
see
the
glory
of
the
rising
sun
the
chouans
are
fighting
like
demons
extended
in
long
skirmishing
lines
picking
out
the
cluster
of
gunners
making
right
deadly
use
of
their
english
powder
imperceptibly
but
unflinchingly
closing
their
scattered
groups
until
the
signal
comes
and
with
ringing
cries
notre
dame
dauray
and
vive
le
roi
they
charge
undismayed
by
odds
the
serried
ranks
of
the
republicans
she
from
the
top
of
the
druidical
stone
watches
the
progress
of
the
day
her
red
parted
mouth
twitches
as
she
follows
the
efforts
of
the
men
behind
her
the
gars
of
savenaye
grasping
with
angry
clutch
some
a
new
musket
others
an
ancient
straightened
scythe
gaze
fiercely
on
the
scene
from
under
their
broad
felts
now
and
then
a
flight
of
republican
bullets
hum
about
their
ears
and
they
look
anxiously
to
their
lady
but
that
fearless
head
never
bends
then
the
moment
arrives
and
with
a
fervent
god
be
with
you
brave
people
she
hurls
by
a
stirring
gesture
the
last
reserve
on
to
the
fight
and
now
he
finds
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
furious
medley
striking
mechanically
his
soul
away
behind
on
that
stone
with
her
presently
as
the
frenzy
waxes
wilder
he
is
conscious
that
victory
is
not
with
them
but
that
they
are
pressed
back
and
encompassed
and
that
for
each
blue
coat
cast
down
amidst
the
yells
and
oaths
two
more
seem
to
come
out
of
the
rain
and
smoke
whilst
the
bare
feet
and
wooden
shoes
and
the
long
hair
of
his
peasants
are
seen
in
everlessening
ranks
and
in
time
they
find
themselves
thrown
back
to
the
menhir
she
is
there
still
calm
but
ghastly
white
a
pistol
in
each
hand
around
her
through
the
wet
smoke
rise
and
fall
with
sickening
thuds
the
clubbed
muskets
of
three
or
four
men
and
then
one
by
one
these
sink
to
the
ground
too
with
a
wailing
groan
like
a
man
in
a
nightmare
he
sees
the
inevitable
end
and
rushes
to
place
his
body
before
hers
a
bullet
shatters
his
swordblade
now
none
are
left
around
them
but
the
begrimed
and
sinister
faces
of
their
enemies
as
they
stand
prisoners
and
unheeding
the
hideous
clamour
he
with
despair
thinking
of
her
inevitable
fate
at
the
hands
of
such
victors
and
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
her
suddenly
sees
that
in
her
eyes
which
fills
his
soul
to
overflowing
all
is
lost
she
whispers
and
i
shall
never
repay
you
for
all
you
have
done
cousin
the
words
are
uttered
falteringly
almost
plaintively
we
are
not
long
now
for
this
world
friend
she
adds
more
firmly
give
me
your
forgiveness
how
often
has
adrian
heard
this
dead
voice
during
the
strange
vicissitudes
of
these
long
long
years
and
hearing
it
whisper
in
the
vivid
world
of
his
brain
how
often
has
he
not
passionately
longed
that
he
also
had
been
able
to
yield
his
poor
spark
of
life
on
the
last
day
of
her
existence
for
the
usual
fate
of
chouan
prisoners

overtakes
the
surviving

on

may
see
the
actual
proof
of
his
own
desolatenessa
small
stark
figure
wrapped
in
coarse
sailcloth
which
now
two
or
three
ragged
longhaired
men
are
silently
lifting
between
them
he
wonders
at
first
vaguely
why
the
tears
course
down
those
wild
dark
faces
and
then
as
vainly
he
struggles
to
speak
and
is
gently
held
down
by
some
unknown
hand
the
little
white
bundle
is
gone
and
he
knows
that
there
was
the
pitiful
relict
of
his
lovethat
he
will
never
see
her
again





sir
adrian
halted
in
front
of
his
seaward
window
staring
at
the
driven
rain
which
bounded
and
plashed
and
spread
in
minute
torrents
down
the
glass
obscuring
the
already
darkening
vision
of
furious
sea
and
sky
the
dog
that
for
some
moments
had
shown
an
anxious
restlessness
in
singular
concert
with
his
masters
now
rose
at
last
to
sniff
beneath
the
door
no
sound
penetrated
the
roar
of
the
blast
but
the
old
retrievers
uneasiness
his
sharp
warning
bark
at
length
recalled
sir
adrians
wandering
thoughts
to
the
present
and
walking
up
to
the
door
he
opened
it
oh
god
had
the
sea
given
up
its
dead
sir
adrian
staggered
back
fell
on
his
knees
and
clapped
his
hands
together
with
an
agonised
cry
ccile
chapter
vi
the
wheel
of
time
and
to
his
eye
there
was
but
one
beloved
face
on
earth
and
that
was
shining
on
him
byron
upon
the
threshold
she
stood
looking
in
upon
him
with
dark
luminous
eyes
round
the
small
wet
face
tangles
of
raven
hair
fell
limp
and
streaming
dark
raiments
clung
to
her
form
diapered
with
sand
and
seafoam
sodden
with
the
moisture
that
dripped
from
them
to
the
floor
under
the
hem
of
her
skirt
one
foot
peered
forth
shoeless
in
its
mudstained
stocking
sir
adrian
stared
up
at
her
his
brain
whirling
with
a
frenzy
of
joy
gripped
in
its
soaring
ecstasy
by
terror
of
the
incomprehensible
on
the
wings
of
the
storm
and
the
wind
had
she
come
to
him
his
loveacross
the
awful
barriers
that
divide
life
and
death
had
his
longings
and
the
clamour
of
his
desolate
soul
reached
her
after
all
these
years
in
the
farbeyond
and
was
her
sweet
ghost
here
to
bid
him
cease
from
them
and
let
her
lie
at
rest
or
yet
had
she
come
to
call
him
from
the
weary
world
that
their
souls
might
meet
and
be
one
at
last
then
let
her
but
lay
her
lips
against
his
as
once
in
the
bitterness
of
death
that
his
sorelytried
heart
may
break
with
the
exquisite
pang
and
he
too
may
die
upon
their
kiss
swift
such
thoughts
were
tossing
in
the
turmoil
of
his
mind
when
the
vision
smiled

a
young
rosy
living
smile
and
then
reason
memory
the
wonder
of
her
coming
the
haunting
of
her
grave
went
from
him
possessed
by
one
single
rapturous
certainty
he
started
up
and
gathered
the
wet
form
into
his
strong
armsyet
gently
as
if
he
feared
to
crush
the
vision
into
voidand
showered
kisses
on
the
wet
face
not
deathbut
life
a
beating
heart
beneath
his
a
lithe
young
form
under
his
hand
warm
lips
to
his
kisses

merciful
heaven
were
then
these
twenty
years
all
an
evil
fevered
dream
and
was
he
awake
at
length
she
turned
her
face
from
him
after
a
moment
and
put
her
hand
against
his
breast
to
push
him
from
her
and
as
she
did
so
the
wonder
in
the
lovely
familiar
eyes
turned
to
merriment
and
the
lips
parted
into
laughter
the
sound
of
the
girlish
laughter
broke
the
spell
sir
adrian
stepped
back
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
with
a
dazed
look
and
still
she
laughed
on
why
cousin
landale
she
said
at
length
between
the
peals
i
came
to
throw
myself
upon
your
kindness
for
shelter
from
the
storm
buti
had
not
anticipated
such
a
reception
the
voice
clear
and
sweet
with
just
a
tinge
of
outlandish
intonation
struck
adrian
to
the
heart
i
have
not
heard
he
faltered
that
voice
for
twenty
years
then
coming
up
to
her
he
took
her
hands
and
drawing
her
towards
the
firelight
scanned
her
features
with
eager
hungering
eyes
do
not
think
me
mad
child
he
said
at
last
tell
me
who
you
arewhat
has
brought
you
here
ah
god
at
such
a
moment
who
is
it
he
pursued
as
if
to
himself
whilst
still
she
smiled
mockingly
and
answered
not
who
is
it
then
since
ccile
de
savenaye
is
deadand
i
am
not
dreamingnor
in
fever
no
vision
eitherthis
is
flesh
and
blood
yes
indeed
mocked
the
girl
with
another
burst
of
merriment
flesh
and
blood
please
and
very
living
why
cousin
landale
you
that
knew
ccile
de
savenaye
so
well
have
you
forgotten
two
babes
that
were
born
at
your
own
house
of
pulwick
i
believe
tis
true
i
have
somewhat
altered
since
you
saw
me
last
and
again
the
old
room
echoed
to
the
unwonted
sound
of
a
girls
laughter
now
was
the
hallucination
clearing
but
the
reality
evoked
a
new
and
almost
as
poignant
tenderness
ccilephantom
of
a
lifetimes
love
reborn
in
the
flesh
young
as
on
the
last
day
of
her
earthly
existence
coming
back
into
his
life
again
even
the
same
as
she
had
left
it
a
second
wonder
almost
as
sweet
as
the
first
he
clung
to
it
as
one
clings
to
the
presence
of
a
dream
and
joy
unspeakable
the
dream
did
not
melt
away
but
remained
smiling
beautiful
unchanged
cciles
daughter

he
murmured
cciles
self
again
but
she
was
not
so
tall
i
think
and
drew
trembling
reverent
hands
from
her
head
to
her
straight
young
shoulders
and
then
he
started
crying
in
a
changed
voice
how
wet
and
cold
you
are
come
closer
to
the
firesit
you
into
this
chair
here
in
the
warmth
he
piled
up
the
hearth
with
faggots
till
the
flames
roared
again
she
dropped
into
the
proffered
chair
with
a
little
shiver
now
that
he
recalled
her
to
it
she
was
wet
and
cold
too
he
surveyed
her
with
gathering
concern
my
child
he
began
and
hesitated
continuing
after
a
short
pause
of
musingfor
the
thought
struck
him
as
strangei
may
call
you
so
i
suppose
i
that
am
nearly
old
enough
to
be
your
father
my
mind
was
so
unhinged
by
your
sudden
appearance
by
the
wonderful
resemblance
that
i
have
neglected
all
my
duties
as
host
you
will
suffer
from
thiswhat
shall
we
do
to
comfort
you
here
jem
good
dog
call
ren
the
old
retriever
who
concluding
that
the
visitor
was
welcome
had
returned
to
his
doze
here
gathered
his
stiff
limbs
together
hobbled
out
through
the
doorway
to
give
two
or
three
yelping
barks
at
some
point
on
the
stairs
and
then
crawl
back
to
his
cosy
corner
by
the
hearth
the
girl
laughed
again
it
was
all
odd
new
exciting
adrian
looked
down
at
her
ccile
too
had
had
a
merry
heart
even
through
peril
and
misfortune
and
now
there
were
hasty
steps
upon
the
stairs
creaking
above
the
outer
tumult
of
sea
and
wind
and
in
accordance
with
the
longestablished
custom
of
summoning
him
ren
appeared
upon
the
threshold
holding
a
pair
of
candles
at
the
sight
of
the
figure
sitting
by
the
fire
he
halted
as
if
rooted
to
the
ground
and
threw
up
his
hands
each
still
clutching
its
candle
mademoiselle
he
ejaculated
mademoiselle
here
then
rapidly
recovering
his
quick
wits
he
deposited
his
burden
of
light
upon
the
table
advanced
towards
the
lady
made
an
uncouth
but
profound
bow
and
turned
to
his
master
and
this
your
honour
he
remarked
oracularly
and
in
his
usual
manner
of
literal
adaptation
was
also
part
of
the
news
i
had
for
your
honour
from
my
last
journey
but
my
faith
i
did
not
know
how
to
take
myself
to
it
as
your
honour
was
so
much
occupied
with
old
times
this
evening
but
i
had
seen
mademoiselle
at
the
castle
as
mademoiselle
can
tell
you
herself
and
if
your
honour
he
added
with
a
look
of
astonishment
will
have
the
goodness
to
say
how
it
is
possible
that
mademoiselle
managed
to
arrive
here
on
our
isle
in
this
weather
of
all
the
devilsreverence
speaking
and
i
humbly
beg
the
pardon
of
mademoiselle
for
using
such
wordswhen
it
was
with
pain
i
could
land
myself
and
that
before
the
stormi
should
be
grateful
to
your
honour
for
i
avow
i
cannot
comprehend
it
at
all
ah
your
honour
continued
ren
with
an
altered
tone
tis
a
strange
thing
this
the
looks
of
master
and
man
crossed
suddenly
and
in
the
frank
blue
eyes
of
the
breton
peasant
sir
adrian
read
a
reflex
of
his
own
thoughts
yes
he
said
more
in
answer
to
the
look
than
to
the
exclamation
yes
it
is
a
strange
thing
friend
and
his
honour
cannot
read
the
riddle
any
more
than
you
yourself
ren
quoth
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
composedly
from
her
corner
and
as
for
me
i
can
give
no
explanations
until
i
am
a
little
warmer
why
truly
exclaimed
sir
adrian
striking
his
forehead
we
are
a
very
pair
of
dolts
hurry
renny
hurry
call
up
margery
and
bid
her
bring
some
hot

what
she
hasand
blankets
stay
first
fetch
my
furred
cloak
quick
ren
every
moment
is
precious
with
all
the
agitation
of
a
rarely
excited
man
sir
adrian
threw
more
wood
on
the
fire
hunted
for
a
cushion
to
place
beneath
her
feet
and
then
seizing
the
cloak
from
rens
hands
he
helped
her
to
rise
and
wrapped
its
ample
folds
round
her
as
carefully
as
if
she
were
too
precious
almost
to
be
touched
thus
enveloped
she
sank
back
in
the
great
armchair
with
a
cosy
deliberate
kittenlike
movement
and
stretched
out
her
feet
to
the
blaze
laying
the
little
shoeless
one
upon
jems
grey
muzzle
adrian
knelt
beside
her
and
began
gently
to
chafe
it
with
both
hands
and
as
he
knelt
silence
fell
between
them
and
the
storm
howled
out
yonder
he
heard
her
give
a
little
sighthat
sigh
which
would
escape
from
cciles
weariness
in
moments
of
rest
which
had
once
been
so
familiar
and
so
pathetic
a
sound
in
his
ear
and
once
more
the
power
of
the
past
came
over
him
again
he
was
upon
the
heath
near
quiberon
and
ccile
was
sitting
by
him
and
seeking
warmth
by
the
secret
fire
oh
my
darling
he
murmured
your
poor
little
feet
were
so
cold
and
yet
you
would
not
let
me
gather
them
to
my
breast
and
stooping
slowly
he
kissed
the
pretty
foot
in
its
torn
stained
stocking
with
a
passion
he
had
not
yet
shown
the
girl
looked
on
with
an
odd
little
smile
it
was
a
novel
experience
to
inspireeven
vicariouslysuch
feelings
as
these
and
there
was
something
not
unpleasant
in
the
sense
of
the
power
which
had
brought
this
strange
handsome
man
prostrate
before
hera
maidenly
tremor
too
in
the
sensation
of
those
burning
lips
upon
her
feet
he
raised
his
eyes
suddenly
with
the
old
expectation
of
a
rebuff
and
then
at
the
sight
of
the
youthful
curious
face
above
him
betook
himself
to
sighing
too
and
laying
the
little
foot
back
tenderly
upon
the
cushion
he
rose
from
between
the
huge
fur
collar
which
all
but
covered
her
head
the
black
eyes
followed
him
as
alertly
as
a
birds
intercepting
the
soft
melancholy
of
his
gaze
she
smiled
at
him
mischievous
confident
and
uncommunicative
and
snuggled
deeper
into
the
fur
leaning
against
the
high
mantelboard
he
remained
silent
brooding
over
her
the
clock
ticked
off
solemnly
the
fleeting
moments
of
the
wonderful
hour
and
ever
and
anon
the
dog
drew
a
long
breath
of
comfort
and
stretched
out
his
gaunt
limbs
more
luxuriously
to
the
heat
after
a
while
sir
adrian
spoke
he
who
has
hospitality
to
dispense
said
he
smiling
down
at
her
mutinous
grace
should
never
ask
whence
or
how
the
guest
came
to
his
hearth

and
yet
she
made
a
slight
movement
of
laziness
but
volunteered
nothing
and
he
continued
his
look
becoming
more
wistful
as
he
spoke
your
having
reached
this
rock
during
such
weather
is
startling
enough
it
is
gods
providence
that
there
should
live
those
in
these
ruins
who
are
able
to
give
you
succour
but
that
you
should
come
in
to
me
at
the
moment
you
did
he
halted
before
the
bold
inquisitive
brightness
of
her
eyes
some
day
perhaps
you
will
let
me
explain
he
went
on
embarrassed
indeed
i
must
have
seemed
the
most
absolute
madman
to
you
but
he
who
thinks
he
sees
one
returned
from
death
in
angry
waters
may
be
pardoned
some
display
of
emotion
the
girl
sat
up
briskly
and
shook
herself
as
if
in
protest
against
the
sadness
of
his
smile
and
look
i
rise
indeed
from
a
watery
grave
she
said
lightly
or
at
least
from
what
should
have
been
my
grave
had
i
had
my
deserts
for
my
foolishness
as
it
has
turned
out
i
do
not
regret
it
now
though
i
did
about
midway
the
red
lips
parted
and
the
little
teeth
gleamed
i
have
found
such
kindness
and
welcome
she
caressed
the
dog
who
lazily
tried
to
lick
her
hand
it
is
all
such
an
adventure
so
much
more
amusing
than
pulwick
so
much
more
interesting
than
ever
i
fancied
it
might
be
pulwick
you
come
from
pulwick
said
sir
adrian
musing
true
ren
has
said
it
but
just
now
yet
it
is
of
a
piece
with
the
strangeness
of
it
all
yes
said
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
once
more
collecting
her
cloak
which
her
hurried
movement
had
thrown
off
her
shoulder
madelon
and
i
are
now
at
pulwicki
am
molly
cousin
please
to
rememberor
rather
i
am
here
very
warm
now
and
comfortable
and
she
is
somewhere
along
the
shoreperhapsshe
and
john
as
wet
as
drowned
rats
well
well
i
had
best
tell
you
the
tale
from
the
beginning
or
else
we
never
shall
be
out
of
the
labyrinthwe
started
from
pulwick
for
a
ride
by
the
shore
madelon
and
i
when
we
were
on
the
strand
it
came
on
to
rain
there
was
smoke
out
of
your
chimney
i
proposed
a
canter
as
far
as
the
ruins
for
shelter
i
knew
very
well
madelon
would
not
follow
but
i
threw
poor
luciferyou
know
lucifer
mr
landale
has
reserved
him
for
me
of
course
you
know
lucifer
i
believe
he
belongs
to
you
well
i
threw
him
along
the
causeway
john
hes
the
groom
you
know
and
madelon
shrieked
after
me
but
it
was
beautifulthis
magnificent
tearing
gallop
in
the
raini
was
not
going
to
stopbut
when
we
were
half
way
lucifer
and
i
i
saw
suddenly
that
the
foam
seemed
to
cover
the
sand
in
front
of
me
then
i
pulled
up
quick
and
turned
round
to
look
behind
me
there
was
already
a
frightful
wind
and
the
sand
and
the
rain
blinded
me
almost
but
there
was
no
mistakethe
sea
was
running
between
the
shore
and
me
oh
my
god
but
i
was
frightened
then
i
beat
poor
lucifer
until
my
whip
broke
and
he
started
away
with
a
will
but
when
his
feet
began
to
splash
the
water
he
too
became
frightened
and
stopped
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
pulled
out
my
broach
to
spur
him
with
the
pin
but
at
the
first
prick
i
gave
him
he
reared
and
swerved
and
i
fell
right
on
my
face
in
the
froth
i
got
up
and
began
to
run
through
the
water
then
i
came
to
some
stones
and
i
knew
i
was
saved
though
the
water
was
up
to
my
knees
and
rushing
by
like
a
torrent
when
i
had
clambered
up
the
beach
i
thought
again
of
poor
lucifer
i
looked
about
and
saw
him
a
little
way
off
he
was
shaking
and
tossing
his
dear
black
head
and
neighing
though
i
really
did
not
hear
him
for
the
wind
was
in
my
ears
his
body
was
stock
still
i
could
not
see
his
legs
and
gradually
he
sank
lower
and
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
the
water
passed
over
his
head
oh
it
was
horrible
horrible
the
girl
shuddered
and
her
bright
face
clouded
after
a
moment
she
resumed
it
was
only
then
i
thought
of
the
moving
sands
they
spoke
of
the
other
day
at
pulwickand
that
was
why
madelon
and
that
poltroon
groom
would
not
follow
me
yet
perhaps
they
were
wise
after
all
for
the
thought
of
being
buried
alive
made
me
turn
weak
all
of
a
sudden
my
knees
shook
and
i
had
to
sit
down
although
i
knew
i
had
passed
through
the
danger
but
i
was
so
sorry
for
poor
lucifer
i
thought
if
i
had
come
down
and
led
him
poor
fellow
he
might
have
come
with
me
death
is
so
awful
so
hideous
he
was
so
full
of
life
and
carried
me
so
bravely
only
a
few
minutes
before
is
it
not
a
shame
that
there
should
be
such
a
thing
as
death
she
cried
rebelliously
and
looked
up
at
the
man
above
her
whose
face
had
grown
white
at
the
thought
of
the
danger
she
had
barely
escaped
i
waited
she
resumed
at
length
till
i
thought
he
must
be
quite
dead
there
below
and
came
up
to
the
ruins
and
looked
for
an
entrance
i
knocked
at
some
doors
and
called
but
the
wind
was
so
loud
no
one
heard
and
then
at
last
there
was
one
door
i
could
open
so
i
entered
and
came
up
the
stairs
and
startled
you
as
you
know
and
that
is
how
i
came
here
and
how
lucifer
is
drowned
as
she
finished
her
tale
at
last
she
looked
up
at
her
companion
but
sir
adrian
who
had
followed
her
with
everdeepening
earnestness
of
mien
remained
silent
noticing
which
she
added
quickly
and
with
a
certain
tinge
of
defiance
and
now
no
doubt
you
are
not
quite
so
pleased
as
you
seemed
at
first
with
the
apparition
which
has
caused
you
the
loss
of
one
of
your
best
horses
why
child
cried
sir
adrian
so
that
you
be
safe
you
might
have
left
all
pulwick
at
the
bottom
of
the
sands
for
me
and
ren
who
entered
the
room
at
that
moment
heading
the
advance
of
dame
margery
with
the
posset
here
caught
the
extraordinary
sound
of
a
laugh
on
his
masters
lips
and
stepped
back
to
chuckle
to
himself
and
rub
his
hands
who
would
have
believed
that
he
muttered
and
i
who
was
afraid
to
tell
his
honour
oh
yes
there
are
better
times
coming
now
in
with
you
mother
margery
see
for
yourself
who
is
there
holding
in
both
hands
a
fragrant
steaming
bowl
the
old
crone
made
her
slow
entrance
upon
the
scene
peering
with
dim
eyes
and
dropping
tremulous
curtseys
every
two
or
three
steps
renny
towd
me
as
you
wanted
summat
hot
for
a
lady
she
began
cautiously
and
then
having
approached
near
for
recognition
at
last
burst
forth
into
a
longdrawn
cry
eh
you
never
says
eh
dear
o
me
and
was
fain
to
relinquish
the
bowl
to
her
fellowservant
who
narrowly
watching
dived
forward
just
in
time
to
catch
it
from
her
that
she
might
clasp
her
aged
hands
together
once
and
again
with
everrenewed
gestures
of
astonishment
an
it
were
truth
then
an
i
that
towd
renny
to
give
over
his
nonsensei
didnt
believe

i
welly
couldnt
eh
mester
adrian
but
shes

dead
and
gone
the
spit
an
image
she
iseeh
she
is
molly
de
savenaye
laughed
aloud
stretched
out
her
hand
for
the
bowl
and
began
with
dainty
caution
to
sip
its
scalding
contents
ah
my
dear
margery
said
the
master
we
little
thought
what
a
guest
the
sea
would
cast
up
at
our
doors
tonight
and
now
we
must
do
our
best
for
her
when
shes
finished
your
comforting
mixture
i
shall
give
her
into
your
charge
you
ought
to
put
her
to
bedit
will
not
be
the
first
time
ah
it
will
not
and
a
troublesome
child
she
was
replied
margery
after
the
usual
pause
for
the
assimilation
of
his
remark
turning
to
the
speaker
from
her
palsied
yet
critical
survey
of
her
whilom
nursling
and
ill
see
to
her
never
fear

fettle

as

is
ready
i
am
upon
which
dropping
a
last
curtsey
with
an
assumed
dignity
which
would
have
befitted
a
mistress
of
the
robes
she
took
her
departure
leaving
adrian
smiling
with
amusement
at
her
specious
manner
of
announcing
that
his
own
bedroomthe
only
one
available
for
the
purpose
in
the
ruinswas
being
duly
converted
into
a
ladys
bower
it
grieves
me
to
think
mused
he
after
a
pause
while
ren
still
bursting
with
ungratified
curiosity
hung
about
the
further
end
of
the
room
of
the
terrible
anxiety
they
must
be
in
about
you
at
pulwick
and
of
our
absolute
inability
to
convey
to
them
the
good
news
of
your
safety
the
girl
gave
a
little
laugh
with
her
lips
over
the
cup
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
said
nothing
my
god
yes
quoth
ren
cheerfully
from
his
corner
notre
dame
dauray
has
watched
over
mademoiselle
today
she
would
not
permit
the
daughter
to
die
like
the
mother
and
now
we
have
got
her
ladyship
we
shall
keep
her
too
this
if
your
honour
remembers
his
sailors
knowledge
looks
like
a
threedays
gale
you
are
right
i
fancy
said
sir
adrian
going
over
to
him
and
looking
out
of
the
window
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
will
have
to
take
up
her
abode
in
our
lighthouse
for
a
longer
time
than
she
bargained
i
do
not
remember
hearing
the
breakers
thunder
in
our
cave
so
loud
for
many
years
i
trust
continued
the
lightkeeper
coming
down
to
his
fair
guest
again
that
you
may
be
able
to
endure
such
rough
hospitality
as
ours
must
needs
be
it
has
been
much
more
pleasant
and
i
feel
far
more
welcome
already
than
at
pulwick
remarked
mademoiselle
between
two
deliberate
sips
and
in
no
way
discomposed
it
seemed
at
the
prospect
held
out
to
her
how
cried
sir
adrian
with
a
start
while
the
unwonted
flush
mounted
to
his
forehead
you
not
welcome
at
pulwick
have
they
not
welcomed
a
child
of
ccile
de
savenaye
at
pulwick
thank
god
then
for
the
accident
that
has
sent
you
to
me
the
girl
looked
at
him
with
an
inquisitive
smile
in
her
eyes
there
was
something
on
her
lips
which
she
restrained
surrendering
her
cup
she
remarked
demurely
yes
it
was
a
lucky
accident
was
it
not
that
there
was
some
one
to
offer
shelter
to
the
outcast
from
the
sea
it
is
like
a
tale
of
old
it
is
delightful
delightful
too
not
to
be
drowned
safe
and
sound

and
welcome
in
this
curious
old
place
she
had
risen
and
as
the
cloak
fell
from
her
steaming
garments
again
she
shivered
but
you
are
right
she
said
i
must
go
to
bed
and
get
these
damp
garments
off
and
so
my
lord
of
scarthey
i
will
retire
to
my
apartments
my
lady
in
waiting
i
see
yonder
is
ready
for
me
with
a
quaint
mixture
of
playfulness
and
gravity
she
extended
her
hand
and
adrian
stooped
and
kissed
itas

had
kissed

of
gladness
molly
de
savenaye
in
her
improvised
bedroom
wet
as
she
was
could
hardly
betake
herself
to
disrobing
so
amused
was
she
in
surveying
the
fresh
and
romantic
oddity
of
her
surroundings
with
their
mixture
of
barbarous
rudeness
and
almost
womanish
refinement
old
margerys
fumbling
hands
were
not
nimble
either
and
it
was
long
since
she
had
acted
as
attendant
upon
one
of
her
own
sex
and
so
the
matter
progressed
but
slowly
but
the
speed
of
margerys
tongue
was
apparently
not
affected
by
its
length
of
service
it
wagged
ceaselessly
the
girl
between
her
own
moods
of
curious
speculation
vouchsafing
an
amused
halfcontemptuous
ear
presently
however
as
the
nurses
reminiscences
wandered
from
the
less
interesting
topic
of
her
own
vicissitudes
the
children
she
had
reared
or
buried
and
the
marvellous
ailments
she
had
endured
to
an
account
of
those
days
when
she
had
served
the
french
madam
and
her
babes
molly
slowly
peeling
a
clinging
sleeve
from
her
arm
turned
a
more
eager
and
attentive
face
to
her
ah
quoth
margery
appraising
her
with
blear
eyes
its
a
queer
thing
how
ye
favour
your
mother
miss
she
had
just
they
beautiful
shoulders
and
arms
as
firm
an
as
white
but
youre
taller
i
think
and
may
be
so
to
speak
a
stouter
make
altogether
eh
dear
you
were
always
a
fine
child
and
the
poor
lady
set
a
deal
of
store
on
you
she
did
she
took
you
with
her
and
left
your
sister
with
my
sally
when
she
was
trapesing
up
to
london
and
back
with
mester
adrian
ay
and
me
with
ye
and
many
the
day
that
i
wished

pulwick
and
i
mind
the
day
she
took
leave
of
you
i
do
that
well
here
dame
margery
paused
and
shook
her
head
solemnly
then
pursued
in
another
key
see
now
miss
dear
just
step

of
they
wet
things

said
molly
gratefully
wrapping
the
hot
linen
round
her
young
beauty
and
beginning
to
rub
her
black
locks
energetically
where

o

up
in

just

as
another
bairn
an
carried
her
to
the
boat
yes
said
molly
gazing
into
the
burning
logs
with
brilliant
eyes
but
speaking
low
as
if
to
herself
so
that
her
attendants
deaf
ears
failed
to
catch
the
meaning
of
the
words
ah
that
was
life
indeed
happy
mother
to
have
seen
such
lifethough
she
did
die
young
as
ye
say
miss
answered
margery
making
a
guess
at
the
most
likely
comment
from
a
daughters
lips
it
was
cruel
hardit
was
that
come
make
haste
cries
the
other
young
gentlemen
my
word
they
were
in
a
hurry
lest
madam
happen
to
change
her
mind
i
could
welly
have
laughed
to
see
their
faces
when
mester
adrian
were
trying
to
persuade
her
to
stop
at
pulwick
and
let
the
men
go
alone
t
wernt
for
that
they
reckoned
to
go
all
that
road
to
france
ye
may
think
miss
well
miss
in
a
few
minutes
they
was
all
out
i
the
boat
wi
th
waves
tossin
eman
i
stood
watchin
with
you
i
my
arms
cryin
and
kickin
out
wi
your
little
legs
an
hittin
of
me
wi
your
little
ands
same
as
if
ye
knowed
summat
o
what
was
agate
poor
lamb
an
was
angry
wi
me
for
keepin
ye
then
in
a
little
while
the
big
white
sails
o
th
ship
went
swellin
out
an
soon
it
was
gone
an
that
was
th
last
we
saw
o
madam
a
twothree
year
arter
you
an
miss
maddyline
was
fetched
away
to
france
as
ive
been
towd
i
doubt
you
didnt
so
much
as
think
there
was
such
a
place
as
pulwick
though
many
a
one
there
minds
how
they
dandled
and
played
wi
you
when
you
was
a
wee
bairn
miss
well
i
am
very
glad
to
be
back
in
england
anyhow
said
molly
nimbly
slipping
into
bed
oh
margery
what
delicious
warm
sheets
and
how
good
it
is
to
be
in
bed
alive
dry
and
warm
after
all
a
new
atmosphere
pervaded
scarthey
that
night
the
peaceful
monotony
of
years
since
the
master
of
pulwick
had
migrated
to
his
ruins
was
broken
at
last
and
happily
a
warm
colour
seemed
to
have
crept
upon
the
hitherto
dun
and
dull
surroundings
and
brightened
all
the
prospects
at
any
rate
ren
over
his
busy
work
in
the
lantern
whistled
and
hummed
snatches
of
song
with
unwonted
blithesomeness
and
after
lighting
the
steady
watchlight
and
securing
all
his
paraphernalia
with
extra
care
dallied
some
time
longer
than
usual
on
the
outer
platform
striving
to
snatch
through
the
driven
wraith
a
glance
of
the
distant
lights
of
pulwick
for
there
in
the
long
distance
ensconced
among
the
woods
stood
a
certain
gatelodge
of
greystone
much
covered
with
ivy
which
sheltered
among
other
inmates
the
gatekeepers
blueeyed
ripe
and
ruddy
daughterdame
margerys
pet
grandchild
the
idea
of
ever
leaving
the
mastereven
for
the
sake
of
the
happiness
to
be
found
over
yonderwas
not
one
to
be
entertained
by
ren
but
what
if
dreams
of
a
return
to
the
life
of
the
world
should
arise
after
today
in
the
recluses
mind
ah
the
masters
eyes
had
been
filled
with
light
and
had
he
not
actually
laughed
ren
peered
again
through
the
wind
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
world
abroad
save
grey
tumbling
waters
foaming
at
the
foot
of
the
islet
fretful
waters
coalescing
all
around
with
the
driven
misty
air
a
desolate
view
enough
had
there
been
room
for
melancholy
thoughts
in
his
heart
blithely
did
he
descend
the
steep
wooden
stairs
from
the
roaring
weatherbeaten
platform
to
the
more
secure
inhabited
keep
and
humming
a
satisfied
tune
he
entered
upon
margery
in
her
flaming
kitchen
to
find
the
old
lady
intent
on
sorting
out
a
heap
of
feminine
garments
and
spreading
them
before
the
fire
ren
took
up
a
little
shoe
sandsoiled
and
limp
and
reverentially
rubbed
it
on
his
sleeve
well
mother
he
said
cheerfully
it
is
a
long
while
since
you
had
to
do
with
such
pretty
things
my
faith
these
are
droll
doings
ahand
good
too
you
will
see
mother
margery
there
will
be
good
out
of
all
this
but
margery
invariably
saw
fit
on
principle
to
doubt
all
the
opinions
of
her
rival
eh
she
didnt
hold
so
much
wi
wenches
hersel
an
mester
adrian
she
reckoned
hadnt
come
to
live
here
all
by
himsel
to
have
visitors
breaking
in
on
him
that
gate
there
be
visitors
and
visitors
motheri
tell
you
i
who
speak
to
you
that
his
honour
is
happy
margery
with
a
mysterious
air
smoothed
out
a
long
silk
stocking
and
gave
an
additional
impetus
to
the
tremor
nature
had
already
bestowed
upon
her
aged
head
well
it
wasnt
for
her
to
say
she
hoped
and
prayed
there
was
nowt
bad
a
coomin
on
the
family
again
but
sich
likenesses
as
that
of

to
her
mother
was
not
lucky
to
her
minding
it

come
to
mester
adrian
from
the
french
madam
ah
mester
adrian

been
happy
like
with
her
too
and
she
had
taken
him
away
from
his
home
an
his
people
an
sent
him
back
wiout
s
soul
in
the
end
and
now
her
daughter
has
come
to
give
it
him
back
retorted
ren
as
he
fell
to
with
a
zest
on
the
savoury
mess
he
had
concocted
for
his
own
supper
eh
well
i

for

who

for
the

man
of

must

beast
roamed
through
the
marais
with
chouan
bands
hunted
down
by
the
merciless
revolutionists
like
vermin
falling
as
months
of
that
existence
passed
over
him
from
his
high

scarcely
better
the
long
months
of
confinement
in
the
hulks
of
rochelle
how
often
he
had
regretted
it
then
not
to
have
been
one
of
the
chosen
few
who
the
day
after
capture
stood
in

of
six
levelled
muskets
and
were
sped
to
rest
in
some
unknown
charnel
thennot
now
no
it
was
worth
having
lived
to
this
hour
to
know
of
that
fair
face
in
living
sleep
upon
his
pillow
under
the
safeguard
of
his
roof
good
it
was
that
he
had
escaped
at
last
though
with
the
blood
of
one
of
his
jailors
red
upon
his
hands
the
blood
of
a
perhaps
innocent
man
upon
his
soul
it
was
the
only
time
he
had
taken
a
life
other
than
in
fair
fight
and
the
thought
of
it
had
been
wont
to
fill
him
with
a
sort
of
nausea
but
tonight
he
found
he
could
face
it
not
only
without
remorse
but
without
regret
he
was
glad
he
had
listened
to
rens
insidious
whispersren
who
could
not
endure
the
captivity
to
which
his
master
might
in
time
have
fallen
a
passive
hopeless
slave
and
yet
who
would
have
faced
a
thousand
years
of
it
rather
than
escape
alonethe
faithful
heart
yes
it
was
good
and
he
was
glad
of
it
or
time
would
not
have
come
when
she
stay
how
old
was
the
child
thenalmost
three
years
and
still
sheltered
and
cherished
by
the
house
of
landalewhen
she
would
return
and
gladden
his
eyes
with
a
living
sight
of
ccile
while
ren
watched
in
his
tower
above

who
had
come
for
the
children
and
where
had
they
been
taken
to
their
motherland
perhaps
even
it
might
have
been
before
he
himself
had
left
it
or
yet
to
ireland
where
still
dwelt
kinsfolk
of
their
blood
probably
it
was
at
the
breaking
up
of
the
family
caused
by
the
death
of
sir
thomas
that
these
poor
little
birds
had
been
removed
from
the
nest
that
had
held
them
so
safe
and
close

was
in
97
in
the
yellow
autumn
of

year

embracing
as
brothers

oh
the
stealthy
cold
of
that
blank
cheerless
daybreak
how
it
crept
into
the
marrow
of
his
bones
and
chilled
the
little
energy
and
spirits
he
had
left
for
a
whole
year
they
had
fruitlessly
sought
some
english
vessel
to
convey
this
english
gentleman
back
to
his
native
land
he
could
remember
how
at
the
moment
of
separation
from
the
one
friend
who
had
loved
both
him
and

clambered
from
aboard
the
poor
little
smack
up
the
forbidding
sides
of
the
english

how
swiftly
the

had
moved
apart
the
mist
the
greyness
and
desolateness
the
lapping
of
the
waters
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
seamen
all
so
full
of
heartpiercing
associations
to
him
and
the
last
vision
of
rens
simple
face
with
tears
pouring
down
it
and
his
open
mouth
spasmodically
trying
to
give
out
a
hearty
cheer
despite
the
sobs
that
came
heaving
up
to
it
how
little
the
simple
fellow
dreamed
of
what
bitterness
the
future
was
yet
holding
for
his
brother
and
master
to
end
in
these
reunions

vessel
which
had
taken

that
had
sailed
from

to
meet
her
proved
to
be
a
privateer
bound
for
the
west
indies
but
cruising
somewhat
out
of
her
way
in
the
hope
of
outgoing
prizes
from
nantes
the
captain
who
had
been
led
to
expect
something
of
importance
from
the
smacks
behaviour
in
high
dudgeon
at
finding
that
so
much
bustle
and
waste
of
time
was
only
to
burden
him
with
a
mere
castaway
seeking
a
passage
homeone
who
albeit
a
countryman
was
too
ragged
and
disreputable
in
looks
to
be
trusted
in
his
assurances
of
rewardgranted
him
indeed
the
hospitality
of
his
ship
but
on
the
condition
of
his
becoming
a
hand
in
the
company
during
the
forthcoming
expedition
there
was
a
rough
measure
of
equity
in
the
arrangement
and
adrian
accepted
it
the
only
alternative
moreover
would
have
been
a
jump
overboard
and
so
began
a
hard
spell
of
life
but
a
few
shades
removed
from
his
existence
among
the
chouan
guerillas
a
predatory
cruise
lasting
over
a
year
during
which
the
only
changes
rung
in
the
gamut
of
its
purpose
were
the
swooping
down
as
a
vulture
might
upon
unprotected
ships
flying
with
superior
speed
from
obviously
stronger
crafts
engaging
with
hawklike
bravery
everything
afloat
that
displayed
inimical
colours
if
it
offered
an
equal
chance
of
fight
and
this
for
more
than
a
year
until
the
privateer
much
battered
but
safe
despite
her
vicissitudes
made
halifax
for
refitting
here
at
the
first
suitable
port
she
had
touched
adrian
claimed
and
obtained
his
release
from
obligations
which
made
his
life
almost
unendurable
then
ensued
a
period
of
the
most
absolute
penury
unpopular
with
most
of
his
messmates
for
his
melancholy
taciturnity
despised
by
the
more
brutal
as
one
who
had
as
little
stomach
for
a
carouse
as
for
a
bloody
fight
he
left
the
ship
without
receiving
or
even
thinking
of
his
share
of
prizemoney
and
he
had
to
support
existence
with
such
mean
mechanical
employment
as
came
in
his
way
till
an
opportunity
was
offered
of
engaging
himself
as
seaman
again
from
sheer
necessity
on
a
homewardbound
merchantmanan
opportunity
which
he
seized
if
not
eagerly
for
there
was
no
eagerness
left
in
him
yet
under
the
pressure
of
purpose
next
the
long
slowly
plodding
toilsome
seemingly
eternal
course
across
the
ocean
but
even
a
convoy
restricted
to
the
speed
of
its
slowest
member
if
it
escape
capture
or
natural
destruction
must
meet
the
opposite
shore
at
length
and
the
last
year
of
the
century
had
lapsed
in
the
even
race
of
time
when
after
many
dreary
weeks
on
the
first
of
january
1801
the
long
low
lines
of
sandhills
on
the
lancastrian
coast
loomed
in
sight
the
escort
drew
away
swiftly
southwards
as
if
in
joyful
relief
from
the
tedious
task
leaving
the
convoy
to
enter
the
mersey
safe
and
sound
that
evening
adrian
the
roughlooking
and
taciturn
sailor
set
foot
for
a
short
while
on
his
native
land
after
six
years
of
an
exile
which
had
made
of
him
at
five
and
twenty
a
prematurely
aged
and
hopelessly
disillusioned
man
and
sir
adrian
as
he
mused
wrapped
in
the
honoured
fur
cloak
with
eyes
half
closed
by
his
sympathetic
fire
recalled
how
little
of
joy
this
return
had
had
for
him
it
was
the
goal
he
had
striven
to
reach
and
he
had
reached
it
that
was
all
nay
he
recalled
how
when
at
hand
he
had
almost
dreaded
the
actual
arrival
home
dreaded
with
the
infinite
heartsickness
of
sorrow
the
emotions
of
the
family
welcome
to
one
restored
from
such
perils
by
flood
and
fieldif
not
indeed
already
mourned
for
and
forgottenlittle
wotting
how
far
that
return
to
pulwick
that
seemed
near
and
certain
was
still
away
in
the
dim
future
of
life
yet
but
for
the
fit
of
hypochondriacal
humour
which
had
fallen
black
upon
him
that
day
of
deliverance
and
made
him
yearn
with
an
intensity
increasing
every
moment
to
separate
himself
from
his
repugnant
associates
and
haste
the
moment
of
solitude
and
silence
he
might
have
been
rescued
then
and
for
ever
from
the
quagmire
in
which
perverse
circumstances
had
enslaved

matey
said
one
of
his
fellowworkers
to
him
in
a
transient
fit
of
goodfellowship
which
the
prospect
of
approaching
sprees
had
engendered
in
him
even
towards
one
whom
all
on
board
had
felt
vaguely
to
be
of
a
different
order
and
disliked
accordingly

dont
seem
to
like

to
you
for
a
this
was
the
parting
of
adrian
landale
from
his
fellowworkers
the
idea
of
spending
even
one
night
more
in
that
atmosphere
of
rum
and
filth
in
the
intimate
hearing
of
blasphemous
and
obscene
language
was
too
repulsive
to
be
entertained
and
he
had
turned
away
from
the
offer
with
a
gesture
of
horror
with
half
a
dozen
others
in
whose
souls
the
attractions
of
the
town
at
night
proved
stronger
than
the
fear
of
the
press
party
he
disembarked
on
the
lancashire
side
and
separating
from
his
companions
for
ever
as
he
thought
ascended
the
miserable
lanes
leading
from
the
river
to
the
upper
town
his
purpose
was
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
more
decent
hotels
to
call
the
next
day
for
help
at
the
bankinghouse
with
which
the
landales
had
dealt
for
ages
past
and
thence
to
take
coach
for
pulwick
but
he
had
planned
without
taking
reck
of
his
circumstances
no
hotel
of
repute
would
entertain
this
weatherbeaten
common
sailor
in
the
meanest
of
workstained
clothes
after
failing
at
various
places
even
to
obtain
a
hearing
being
threatened
with
forcible
ejectment
derisively
referred
to
suitable
cribs
in
love
lane
or
tower
street
he
gave
up
the
attempt
and
in
his
usual
dejection
of
spirit
intensified
by
unavowed
and
unreasonable
anger
wandered
through
the
dark
streets
brooding
thus
aimlessly
wandering
the
remembrance
of
his
young
utopian
imaginings
came
back
to
him
to
mock
him
dreams
of
universal
brotherhood
of
equality
of
harmony
he
had
already
seen
the
apostles
of
equality
and
brotherhood
at
workon
the
banks
of
the
vilaine
and
realising
how
he
himself
now
reduced
to
the
lowest
level
in
the
social
scale
hunted
with
insult
from
every
haunt
above
that
level
yet
loathed
and
abhorred
the
very
thought
of
associating
again
with
his
recent
brothers
in
degradation
he
laughed
a
laugh
of
bitter
selfcontempt
but
the
night
was
piercing
cold
and
in
time
the
question
arose
whether
the
stench
and
closeness
of
a
riverside
eatinghouse
would
not
be
more
endurable
than
the
cutting
wind
the
sleet
and
the
sharper
pangs
of
hunger
his
roaming
had
brought
him
once
more
to
that
quarter
of
the
town
best
suited
to
the
likes
of
him
according
to
the
innkeepers
opinion
and
he
found
himself
actually
seeking
a
house
of
entertainment
in
the
slimy
illlighted
narrow
street
when
from
out
the
dimness
running
towards
him
with
bare
feet
paddling
in
the
sludge
came
a
slatternly
girl
with
unkempt
wisps
of
red
hair
hanging
over
her
face
under
the
tartan
shawl
run
run
jack
she
cried
hoarsely
as
she
passed
by
breathless
t
gangs
comin
up
a
sudden
loathly
fear
seized
adrian
by
the
heart
he
too
took
to
his
heels
by
the
side
of
the
slut
with
all
the
swiftness
his
tired
frame
could
muster
im
going
to
warn
my
jo
she
gasped
as
jostling
each
other
they
darted
through
a
maze
of
nameless
alleys
and
then
as
spent
with
running
they
emerged
at
last
into
a
broader
street
it
was
to
find
themselves
in
the
very
midst
of
another
party
of
manofwars
men
whose
brass
beltbuckles
glinted
under
the
flickering
light
of
the
oillamp
swinging
across
the
way
adrian
stopped
dead
short
and
looked
at
the
girl
in
mute
reproach
may
god
strike
me
dead
she
screamed
clapping
her
hands
together
if
i
knew
the
bloody
thieves
were
there
oh
my
bonny
lad
i
meant
to
save
ye
and
as
her
words
rang
in
the
air
two
sailors
had
adrian
by
the
collar
and
a
facetious
bluejacket
seized
her
round
the
waist
with
hideous
bantering
a
very
young
officer
wrapped
up
in
a
cloak
stood
a
few
paces
apart
calmly
looking
on
to
him
adrian
called
out
in
fierce
yet
anguished
expostulation
i
am
a
free
and
independent
subject
sir
an
english
gentleman
i
demand
that
you
order
your
men
to
release
me
for
heavens
sake
he
added
pleadingly
give
me
but
a
moments
private
hearing
a
loud
guffaw
rang
through
the
group
in
truth
if
appearances
make
the
gentleman
adrian
was
then
but
a
sorry
specimen
the
officer
smiledthe
insufferable
smile
of
a
conceited
boy
raised
to
authority
i
can
have
no
possible
doubt
of
your
gentility
sir
he
said
with
mocking
politeness
and
measuring
under
the
glimmering
light
first
the
prisoner
from
head
to
foot
and
then
the
girl
who
scratching
and
blaspheming
vainly
tried
to
make
her
escape
but
sir
as
a
freeborn
english
gentleman
it
will
be
your
duty
to
help
his
majesty
to
fight
his
french
enemies
take
the
english
gentleman
along
my
lads
a
roar
of
approbation
at
the
officers
facetiousness
ran
through
the
party
an
his
mothers
milk
not
dry
upon
his
lips
cried
the
girl
with
a
crow
of
derisive
fury
planting
as
she
spoke
a
sounding
smack
on
a
broad
tanned
face
bent
towards
her
the
little
officer
grew
pink
come
my
men
do
your
duty
he
thundered
in
his
deepest
bass
a
rage
such
as
he
never
had
felt
in
his
life
suddenly
filled
adrians
whole
being
he
was
a
bigger
man
than
any
of
the
party
and
the
rough
life
that
fate
had
imposed
on
him
had
fostered
a
strength
of
limb
beyond
the
common
a
thrust
of
his
knee
prostrated
one
of
his
captors
a
blow
in
the
eye
from
his
elbow
staggered
the
other
the
next
instant
he
had
snatched
away
the
cutlass
which
a
third
was
drawing
and
with
it
he
cleared
for
a
moment
a
space
around
him
but
as
he
would
have
bounded
into
freedom
a
felling
blow
descended
on
his
head
from
behind
a
sheet
of
flame
spread
before
his
eyes
and
behind
this
blaze
disappeared
the
last
that
adrian
landale
was
to
see
of
england
for
another
spell
of
years
when
he
came
back
to
his
senses
he
was
once
more
on
board
shipa
slave
legally
kidnapped
degraded
by
full
and
proper
warrant
from
his
legitimate
status
for
no
crime
that
could
even
be
invented
against
him
a
slave
to
be
retained
for
work
or
war
at
his
masters
pleasure
liable
like
a
slave
to
be
flogged
to
death
for
daring
to
assert
his
light
of
independence





the
memory
of
that
nights
doing
and
of
the
odious
bondage
to
which
it
was
a
prelude
rarely
failed
to
stir
the
gall
of
resentment
in
sir
adrian
men
of
peaceable
instincts
are
perhaps
the
most
prone
to
the
feeling
of
indignation
but
tonight
a
change
had
come
over
the
spirit
of
his
dreams
he
could
think
of
that
past
simply
as
the
pastthe
period
of
time
which
would
have
had
to
be
spent
until
the
advent
of
the
wonderworking
present
these
decrees
of
fate
had
had
a
purpose
had
the
past
by
one
jot
been
different
the
events
of
this
admirable
day
might
never
have
been
the
glowing
edifice
on
the
hearth
collapsed
with
a
darting
of
sudden
flame
and
a
rolling
of
red
cinders
sir
adrian
rose
to
rebuild
his
fire
for
the
night
and
being
once
roused
was
tempted
by
the
ruddiness
of
the
wine
glinting
under
the
quiet
rays
of
the
lamp
to
advance
to
the
table
and
partake
of
his
forgotten
supper
the
calm
atmosphere
the
warmth
and
quiet
of
the
room
in
which
he
broke
his
bread
and
sipped
his
wine
whilst
old
jem
stretched
by
the
hearth
gazed
at
him
with
yellow
upturned
eyes
full
of
lazy
inquiry
concerning
this
departure
from
the
usual
nightly
regularity
the
serene
placidity
of
the
scene
indoors
as
contrasting
with
the
angry
voices
of
elements
without
answered
to
the
peacethe
strange
peacethat
filled
the
mans
soul
even
in
the
midst
of
such
uncongenial
memories
as
now
rose
up
before
him
in
vivid
concatenation
she
was
then
five
years
old
where
was
she
when
he
began
that
seemingly
endless
cruise
with
the
frigate
porcupine
he
tried
to
fancy
a
ccile
five
years
olda
chubby
curlyheaded
mite
nursing
dolls
and
teasing
kittens
whilst
he
was
bullied
and
browbeaten
by
coarse
petty
officers
shunned
and
hated
by
his
messmates
and
flogged
at
length
by
a
tyrannizing
captain
for
obduracybut
he
could
only
see
a
ccile
in
the
spring
of
womanhood
nestling
in
the
armchair
yonder
by
the
fire
and
looking
up
at
him
from
the
folds
of
a
fur
cloak
she
was
seven
years
old
when
he
was
flogged
ah
god
those
had
been
days
and
yet
in
the
lofty
soul
of
him
he
had
counted
it
no
disgrace
and
he
had
been
flogged
again
ay
and
a
third
time
for
that
obstinate
head
that
would
not
bend
that
obstinate
tongue
that
would
persist
in
demanding
restitution
of
liberty
the
life
on
board
the
privateer
had
been
a
matter
of
bargain
he
had
bartered
also
labour
and
obedience
with
the
merchantman
for
the
passage
home
but
the
king
had
no
right
to
compel
the
service
of
a
free
man
she
was
but
twelve
years
old
when
he
was
finally
released
from
thraldomit
had
only
lasted
four
years
after
all
yet
what
a
cycle
for
one
of
his
temper
four
years
with
scarce
a
moment
of
solitudefor
no
shoreleave
was
ever
allowed
to
one
who
openly
repudiated
any
service
contract
four
years
of
a
life
where
the
sole
prospect
of

of
carnage
so
eagerly
anticipated
by
officers
and
men
alike
including
himself
though
for
a
reason
little
suspected
by
his
companions
but
even
the
historic
seafights
of
the
porcupine
so
far
as
they
affected
adrian
landale
formed
in
themselves
a
chain
of
monotony
it
was
ever
the
same
hurling
of
shot
from
ship
to
ship
the
same
fierce
exchange
of
cutlassthrows
and
pikepushes
between
men
who
had
never
seen
each
other
before
the
same
yelling
and
execrations
sights
sounds
and
smells
ever
the
same
in
horror
the
same
cheers
when
the
enemys
colours
were
lowered
followed
by
the
same
transient
depression
the
cleansing
of
decks
from
stains
of
powder
and
mire
of
human
blood
the
casting
overboard
of
human
bodies
that
had
done
their
lifes
work
broken
waste
and
other
rubbish
for
weeks
adrian
after
would
taste
blood
smell
blood
dream
blood
till
it
seemed
in
his
nausea
that
all
the
waters
of
the
wide
clean
seas
could
never
wash
the
taint
from
him
again
and
before
the
first
horrid
impressions
had
time
to
fade
the
next
occasion
would
have
come
round
again
it
was
not
the
fate
of
adrian
landale
that
either
steel
or
shot
or
splintered
timber
or
falling
tackles
should
put
an
end
to
his
dreary
life
welcome
as
such
an
end
would
have
been
to
him
then
then

but
not
now
remembering
now
his
unaccountable
escape
from
the
destruction
which
had
swept
from
his
side
many
another
whose
eagerness
for
the
fray
had
certes
not
sprung
like
his
own
from
a
desire
to
court
destruction
he
shuddered
and
there
arose
in
his
mind
the
trite
old
adage
man
proposeth
god
had
disposed
otherwise
it
was
not
destined
that
adrian
landale
should
be
shot
on
the
high
seas
any
more
than
he
should
be
drowned
in
the
rolling
mud
of
the
vilainehe
was
reserved
for
this
day
as
a
setoff
to
all
the
bitterness
that
had
been
meted
out
to
him
he
was
to
see
the
image
of
his
dead
love
rise
from
the
sea
once
more
and
meanwhile
his
very
despair
and
sullenness
had
been
turned
to
his
good
it
would
not
be
said
if
history
should
take
count
of
the
fact
that
while
the
lord
of
pulwick
had
served
four
years
before
the
mast
he
had
ever
disgraced
his
name
by
cowardice
whether
such
reasonings
were
in
accordance
even
with
the
most
optimistic
philosophy
sir
adrian
himself
at
other
times
might
have
doubted
but
he
was
tender
in
thought
this
stormy
night
with
the
grateful
relaxation
that
a
happy
break
brings
in
the
midst
of
longdrawn
melancholy
everything
had
been
working
towards
this
endthat
he
should
be
the
lightkeeper
of
scarthey
on
the
day
when
out
of
the
raging
waters
ccile
would
rise
and
knock
and
ask
for
succour
at
his
chamber
ccile
pshawraving
again
well
the
child
where
was
she
on
the
day
of
the
last
engagement
of
that
pugnacious
porcupine
in
the
year
1805
when
england
was
freed
from
her
long
incubus
of
invasion
she
was
then
twelve
it
had
seemed
if
nothing
short
of
a
wholesale
disaster
could
terminate
that
incongruous
existence
of
his
the
last
action
of
the
frigate
was
a
fruitless
struggle
against
fearful
odds
after
a
prolonged
fight
with
an
enemy
as
dauntless
as
herself
with
twothirds
of
her
ships
company
laid
low
and
commanded
at
length
by
the
youngest
lieutenant
she
was
tackled
as
the
sun
went
low
over
the
scene
of
a
drawn
battle
by
a
fresh
sail
errant
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
timely
dismasting
on
board
the
newcomer
would
have
been
captured
or
finally
sunk
then
and
there
but
that
fate
was
only
held
in
reserve
for
her
bleeding
and
disabled
she
had
drawn
away
under
cover
of
night
from
her
two
hardhit
adversaries
to
encounter
a
squall
that
further
dismantled
her
and
in
such
forlorn
conditions
was
met
and
finally
conquered
by
the
french
privateer
espoir
de
brest
that
pounced
upon
her
in
her
agony
as
the
vulture
upon
his
prey
among
the
remainder
of
the
once
formidable
crew
now
seized
and
battened
down
under
french
hatches
was
of
course
adrian
landalehe
bore
a
charmed
life
and
for
a
short
while
the
only
change
probable
in
his
prospects
was
a
return
to
french
prisons
until
such
time
as
it
pleased
heaven
to
restore
peace
between
the
two
nations
but
the
fortune
of
war
especially
at
sea
is
fickle
and
fitful
the
daring
brig
lettre
de
marque
lespoir
de
brest
soon
after
her
unwonted
haul
of
english
prisoners
was
overtaken
herself
by
one
of
her
own
species
the
st
nicholas
of
liverpool
from
whose
swiftness
nothing
over
the
sea
that
had
not
wings
could
hope
to
escape
if
she
chose
to
give
the
chase
again
did
adrian
from
the
darkness
among
his
fellowcaptives
hear
the
familiar
roar
and
crash
of
cannon
fight
the
hustling
and
the
thud
of
leaping
feet
the
screams
and
oaths
of
battle
and
finally
the
triumphant
shouts
of
english
throats
and
he
knew
that
the
frenchman
was
boarded
a
last
ringing
british
cheer
told
of
the
frenchmans
surrender
and
when
he
and
his
comrades
were
once
more
free
to
breathe
a
draught
of
living
air
after
the
deathly
atmosphere
under
hatches
adrian
learned
that
the
victor
was
not
a
manofwar
but
a
freelance
and
conceived
again
a
faint
hope
that
deliverance
might
be
at
hand
it
was
soon
after
this
action
last
of
the
fights
that
adrian
the
peacelover
had
to
pass
through
and
as
the
two
swift
vessels
now
sailing
in
consort
and
under
the
same
colours
cleaved
the
waters
bound
for
the
mersey
that
a
singular
little
drama
took
place
on
board
the
espoir
de
brest
among
the
younger
officers
of
the
english
privateer
who
were
left
in
charge
of
the
prize
was
a
lad
upon
whom
adrians
jaded
eyes
rested
with
a
feeling
of
mournful
sympathy
so
handsome
was
he
and
so
young
so
full
of
hope
and
spirits
and
joy
of
life
of
all
in
fact
of
which
he
himself
had
been
left
coldly
bare
moreover
the
ring
of
the
merry
voice
the
glint
of
the
clear
eye
awakened
in
his
memory
some
fitful
chord
the
key
of
which
he
vainly
sought
to
trace
one
day
as
the
trim
young
lieutenant
stood
looking
across
the
waters
with
his
brave
eager
gaze
that
seemed
to
have
absorbed
some
of
the
bluegreen
shimmer
of
the
element
he
loved
all
unnoting
the
haggard
sailor
at
his
elbow
a
sudden
flourish
of
the
spyglass
which
he
with
an
eager
movement
swung
up
to
bear
on
some
distant
speck
sent
his
watch
and
seals
flying
out
of
his
fob
upon
the
deck
at
adrians
feet
adrian
picked
them
up
and
as
he
waited
to
restore
them
to
their
owner
who
tarried
some
time
intent
on
his
distant
peering
he
had
time
to
notice
the
coat
and
crest
engraved
upon
one
of
the
massive
trinkets
hanging
from
their
black
ribbons
when
at
last
the
officer
lowered
his
telescope
adrian
came
forward
and
saluted
him
with
a
slight
bow
all
unconsciously
as
unlike
the
average
jack
tars
scrape
to
his
superior
as
can
be
well
imagined
am
i
not
he
asked
addressing
in
you
sir
one
of
the
cochranes
of
the
shaws
the
question
and
the
tone
from
a
common
sailor
were
of
course
enough
to
astonish
the
young
man
but
there
must
be
more
than
this
as
adrian
surmised
to
cause
him
to
blush
wax
angry
and
stammer
like
a
very
schoolboy
found
at
fault
speaking
with
much
sharpness
my
name
is
smith
my
man
cried
he
seizing
his
belongings
and
youjust
carry
on
with
that
coiling
and
my
name
sir
is
adrian
landale
of
pulwick
priory
i
would
like
a
moments
talk
with
you
if
you
will
spare
me
the
time
the
cochranes
of
the
shaws
have
been
friends
of
our
family
for
generations
a
guffaw
burst
from
a
group
of
adrians
mates
working
hard
by
at
this
recurrence
of
what
had
become
with
them
a
standing
joke
but
the
officer
who
had
turned
on
his
heels
veered
round
immediately
and
stood
eyeing
the
speaker
in
profound
astonishment
great
god
is
it
possible
did
you
say
you
were
a
landale
of
pulwick
how
the
devil
came
you
here
then
and
thus
pressgang
was
adrians
laconic
answer
the
lad
gave
a
prolonged
whistle
and
was
lost
for
a
moment
in
cogitation
if
you
are
really
mr
landale
he
began
adding
hastily
as
if
to
cover
an
implied
admissionof
course
i
have
heard
the
name
it
is
well
known
in
lancashireyou
had
better
see
the
skipper
it
must
have
been
some
damnable
mistake
that
has
caused
a
man
of
your
standing
to
be
pressed
the
speaker
ended
with
almost
a
deferential
air
and
the
smile
that
had
already
warmed
adrians
heart
at
the
door
of
the
captains
quarters
he
said
with
the
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
a
curious
error
it
was
you
made
i
assure
you
my
name
is
smithjack
smith
of
liverpool
an
excusable
error
quoth
adrian
smiling
back
for
one
of
your
seals
bear
unmistakably
the
arms
of
cochrane
of
the
shaws
doubtless
some
heirloom
some
intermarriage
no
sir
hang
it
retorted
mr
jack
smith
of
liverpool
his
boyish
face
flushing
again
and
as
he
spoke
he
disengaged
the
trinket
from
its
neighbours
and
jerked
it
pettishly
overboard
i
know
nothing
of
your
shaws
or
your
cochranes
and
then
he
rapped
loudly
at
the
cabindoor
as
if
anxious
to
avoid
further
discussion
or
comment
on
the
subject
the
result
of
the
interview
which
followedinterview
during
which
adrian
in
a
few
words
overcame
the
skippers
scepticism
and
was
bidden
with
all
the
curiosity
men
feel
at
sea
for
any
novelty
to
relate
over
a
bottle
of
wine
the
chain
of
his
adventureswas
his
passing
from
the
forecastle
to
the
officers
quarters
as
an
honoured
guest
on
board
the
st
nicholas
during
the
rest
of
her
cruise
thinking
back
now
upon
the
last
few
weeks
of
his
seagoing
life
sir
adrian
realised
with
something
of
wonder
that
he
had
always
dwelt
on
them
without
dislike
they
were
gilded
in
his
memory
by
the
rays
of
his
new
friendship
and
yet
that
this
young
jack
smith
to
keep
for
him
the
nondescript
name
he
had
for
unknown
reasons
chosen
to
assume
should
be
the
first
man
to
awaken
in
the
misanthropic
adrian
the
charm
of
human
intercourse
was
singular
indeed
one
who
followed
from
choice
the
odious
trade
of
legally
chartered
corsair
who
was
ever
ready
to
barter
the
chance
of
life
and
limb
against
what
fortune
might
bring
in
his
path
to
sacrifice
human
life
to
secure
his
own
end
of
enrichment
well
the
springs
of
friendship
are
to
be
no
more
discerned
than
those
of
love
there
was
none
of
high
or
low
degree
with
the
exception
of
ren
whose
appearance
at
any
time
was
so
welcome
to
the
recluse
upon
his
rock
as
that
of
the
privateersman
and
so
turning
to
his
friend
in
tonights
softened
mood
sir
adrian
thought
gratefully
that
to
him
it
was
that
he
owed
deliverance
from
the
slavery
of
the
kings
service
that
it
was
jack
smith
who
had
made
it
possible
for
adrian
landale
to
live
to
this
great
day
and
await
its
coming
in
peace
the
old
clock
struck
two
and
jem
shivered
on
the
rug
as
the
lightkeeper
rose
at
length
from
the
table
and
sank
in
his
armchair
once
more
visions
of
the
past
had
been
ever
his
companions
now
for
the
first
time
came
visions
of
the
future
to
commingle
with
them
as
if
caught
up
in
the
tide
of
his
visitors
bright
young
life
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
passing
at
length
out
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death





ren
coming
with
noiseless
bare
feet
in
the
angry
yellow
dawn
of
the
second
day
of
the
storm
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
masters
comfort
found
him
sleeping
in
his

the
acting
lord
of
pulwick
if
one
may
so
term
mr
rupert
landale
had
received
a
letter
the
first
reading
of
which
caused
him
a
vivid
annoyance
followed
by
profound
reflection
a
slightlybuilt
darkvisaged
man
this
younger
brother
of
sir
adrian
and
vicarious
master
of
his
house
and
lands
like
to
the
recluse
in
his
exquisite
neatness
of
attire
somewhat
like
also
in
the
mould
of
his
features
which
were
however
more
notably
handsome
than
sir
adrians
but
most
unlike
him
in
an
emphasised
artificiality
of
manner
in
a
restless
and
wary
eye
and
in
the
curious
twist
of
a
thin
lip
which
seemed
to
give
hidden
sarcastic
meaning
even
to
the
most
ordinary
remark
as
now
he
sat
by
his
desk
his
straight
brows
drawn
over
his
ambercoloured
eyes
perusing
the
closely
written
sheets
of
this
troublesome
missive
there
entered
to
him
the
long
plaintive
figure
of
his
maiden
sister
who
had
held
house
for
him
under
his
own
minute
directions
ever
since
the
death
in
premature
childbirth
of
his
young
yearwed
wife
miss
landale
the
eldest
of
the
family
had
had
a
disappointment
in
her
youth
as
a
result
of
which
she
now
played
the
ungrateful
rle
of
old
maid
of
the
family
she
suffered
from
chronic
toothache
as
well
as
from
repressed
romantic
aspirations
and
was
the
me
damne
of
rupert
one
of
the
most
melancholy
of
human
beings
she
was
tersely
characterised
by
the
village
folk
as
a
wummicky
poor
thing
at
the
sight
of
mr

propped
up
her
own
long
sallow
face
upon
its
aching
side
with
a
trembling
hand
and
full
of
agonised
prescience
ventured
to
ask
if
anything
had
happened

her
brother
with
a
sort
of
snarlhe

an
extremely
irritable
temper
under
his
cool
sarcastic
exterior
a
temper
which
his
peculiar
anomalous
circumstances
whilst
they
combined
to
excite
it
forced
him
to
conceal
rigidly
from
most
and
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
let
it
out
occasionally

sophias
meek
ringleted
head
sophia
collapsed
with
hasty
obedience
into
a
chair

then
mr

to
her

peremptorily

throwing
himself
back
upon

shaded

your

the

other
than
mere
family
affection
for
remaining
on
good
terms
with
his
rich
irish
aunt
but
he
had
likewise
reasons
these

obvious
for
wishing
to
pay
his
devoirs
to
her
anywhere

under
the

himself
to

plunged
at
the

after
several
false
starts
found
her
place

owing
to
his

unfortunate

wavered
in

an
exclamation
hung
upon
her
lip

a
sudden
movement
of
ruperts
exquisite
crossed
legs
recalled
her
to

have

you
may
probably
have

the
very
existence

charming
young

were
nevertheless
born
at

you
must
at

have
beheld

lamented
fathers
lifetime

are
as
you
are
doubtless
also

i
have
remarked
a
growing
tendency
in
the
younger
generations
to
neglect
the
study
of
genealogy
even
as
it

with
a
laugh

the
same
evidently
the
first
thing
i
remember
about
her
is
her
lecturing
me
on
genealogy
and
heraldry
when
i
wanted
to
go
fishing
till
schoolboy

heartily

they
have
left
in
these

adrian
and
you
are
the
next
i
have
had
the
charge
of
my
two
young
kinswomen
during
the
last
six
months
that
is
since
they
left
the
couvent
des
dames
anglaises
in
jersey
now
i
think
it
is
time
that
your
branch
of
the
family
should
incur
the
share
of
the
responsibility
your
relationship
to
them
entails
if
adrian
were
as
and
where
he
should
be
i
feel
sure
he
would
embrace
this
opportunity
of
doing
his
duty
as
the
head
of
the
house
without
the
smallest
hesitation
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
offer
the
hospitality
of
pulwick
priory
and
his
protection
to
these
amiable
young
persons
for
as
long
as
they
remain
unmarried
from
you
my
dear
nephew
who
have
undertaken
under
these
melancholy
family
circumstances
to
fill
your
brothers
place
i
do
not
however
expect
so
much
all
i
ask
is
that
you
and
my
niece
sophia
be
kind
enough
to
shelter
and
entertain
your
cousins
for
the
space
of
two
months
while
i
remain
at
bath
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
at
my
age
for
it
is
of
no
use
nephew
for
us
to
deny
our
years
when
any
peerage
guide
must
reveal
them
pretty
closely
to
the
curious
and
i
am
this
month
passing
sixtynine
at
my
age
the
charge
of
two
highspirited
young
females
in
whom
conventional
education
has
failed
to
subdue
aspirations
for
worldly
happiness
whilst
it
has
left
them
somewhat
inexperienced
in
the
conventions
of
society
i
find
a
little
trying
it
does
not
harmonise
with
the
retired
peaceful
existence
to
which
i
am
accustomed
and
at
my
time
of
life
i
think
entitled
in
which
it
is
my
humble
endeavour
to
wean
myself
from
this
earth
which
is
so
full
of
emptiness
and
to
prepare
myself
for
that
other
and
better
home
into
which
we
must
all
resign
ourselves
to
enter
and
happy
indeed
my
dear
rupert
such
of
us
as
will
be
found
worthy
for
come
to
it
we
all
must
and
the
longer
we
live
the
sooner
we
may
expect
to
do
so
the
necessity
of
producing
them
in
society
is
however
rendered
a
matter
of
greater
responsibility
by
the
fact
of
the
handsome
fortunes
which
these
young
creatures
possess
already
not
to
speak
of
their
expectations

his
hand
and
miss
sophia
proceeded
after
the
usual
floundering
a
neighbour
of
mine
at
bunratty
mrs
hambledon
of
brianstown
a
lively
widow
herself
one
of
the
macnamaras
of
the
reeks
and
thus
a
distant
connection
of
the
ballinasloe
branch
of
odonoghues
and
whom
i
had
reason
to
believe
i
could
trustbut
i
will
not
anticipatetook
a
prodigious
fancy
to
miss
molly
and
proposed
towards
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
carrying
her
away
to
dublin
at
the
same
time
the
wet
summer
producing
in
me
an
acute
recurrence
of
that
affection
from
which
as
you
know
i
suffer
and
about
which
you
never
fail
to
make
such
kind
enquiries
at
christmas
and
easter
compelled
me
to
call
in
mr
omally
the
apothecary
who
has
been
my
very
obliging
medical
adviser
for
so
many
years
and
who
strenuously
advocated
an
immediate
course
of
waters
at
bath
in
short
my
dear
nephew
thus
the
matter
was
settled
your
cousin
molly
departed
radiant
with
good
spirits
and
good
looks
for
a
spell
of
gayety
in
dublin
while
your
cousin
madeleine
prepared
with
equal
content
to
accompany
her
old
aunt
to
bath
it
being
arranged
with
mrs
hambledon
that
she
should
herself
conduct
molly
to
us
later
on
we
have
been
here
about
three
weeks
though
persuaded
by
good
mr
omally
that
the
waters
would
benefit
my
old
bones
i
was
actuated
i
must
confess
by
another
motive
in
seeking
this
fashionable
resort
in
such
a
place
as
this
thronged
as
it
is
by
all
the
rank
and
family
of
england
one
can
at
least
know
who
is
who
and
i
was
not
without
hopes
that
my
nieces
with
their
faces
their
name
and
their
fortunes
would
have
the
opportunity
of
contracting
suitable
alliances
and
thus
relieve
me
of
a
charge
for
which
i
am
i
fear
little
fitted
but
alas
my
dear
rupert
i
was
most
woefully
mistaken
bath
is
distinctly
not
the
place
for
two
beautiful
and
unsophisticated
heiresses
and
i
am
certainly
neither
possessed
of
the
spirits
nor
of
the
health
to
guard
them
from
fortunehunters
and
needy
nameless
adventurers
while
it
is
my
desire
to
impress
upon
you
and
my
niece
sophia
that
the
conduct
of
these
young
ladies
has
been
quite
beyond
reproach
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
the
attentions
of
a
certain
person
of
the
name
of
smith
known
here
and
a
favorite
in
the
circles
of
frivolity
and
fashion
as
captain
jack
have
already
made
madeleine
conspicuous
and
although
the
dear
girl
conducts
herself
with
the
utmost
propriety
there
is
an
air
of
romance
and
mystery
about
the
young
man
not
to
speak
of
his
unmistakable
good
looks
which
have
determined
me
to
remove
her
from
his
vicinity
before
her
affections
be
irreparably
engaged
as
for
molly
who
is
a
thorough
odonoghue
and
the
image
of
her
grandmother
that
celebrated
murthering
moll
herself
the
toast
of
bath
in
our
young
days
whose
elopement
with
the
marquis
de
kermelgan
after
he
had
killed
an
english
rival
in
a
duel
was
once
a
ninedays
wonder
in
this
very
town
and
of
whom
you
must
have
heard
mrs
hambledon
restored
her
to
my
care
only
three
days
ago
and
she
has
already
twenty
beaux
to
her
string
though
favouring
nobody
i
am
bound
to
say
but
her
own
amusement
yesterday
she
departed
under
mrs
hambledons
chaperonage
in
the
company
of
a
dozen
of
the
highest
in
rank
here
on
an
expedition
to
clifton
the
while
my
demure
madeleine
spends
the
day
at
the
house
of
her
dear
friend
lady
maria
harewood
whither
i
only
learnt
upon
her
return
at
ten
oclock
under
his
escort
captain
jackin
my
days
that
sort
of
captain
would
have
been
strongly
suspected
of
having
a
shade
too
much
of
the
heath
or
the
london
road
about
himhad
likewise
been
convened
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
with
a
great
towrow
a
coach
full
of
very
merry
company
amongst
whom
the
widow
hambledon
struck
me
as
overmerry
perhaps
landed
my
other
miss
sur
le
perron
this
has
decided
me
we
shall
decamp
sans
tambou
ni
trompette
tomorrow
without
allowing
discussion
from
the
girls
in
which
i
should
probably
be
worsted
we
pack
ourselves
into
my
travelling
coach
and
find
our
way
to
you
but
until
we
are
fairly
on
the
road
i
shall
not
even
let
these
ladies
know
whither
we
are
bound
with
your
kind
permission
then
i
shall
remain
a
few
days
at
pulwick
to
recruit
from
the
fatigues
of
such
a
long
journey
before
leaving
your
fair
cousins
in
your
charge
and
in
that
of
the
gentle
sophia
whom
i
trust
to
entertain
them
with
something
besides
her
usual
melancholy
till
the
time
comes
for
me
to
bring
them
back
with
me
to
bunratty
unless
therefore
you
should
hear
to
the
contrary
you
will
know
that
on
tuesday
your
three
unprotected
female
relatives
will
be
hoping
to
see
your
travelling
carriage
arrive
to
fetch
them
at
the
crown
in
lancaster
your
affectionate
aunt
rose
odonoghue
as
miss
landale
sighed
forth
the
concluding
words
she
dropped
the
little
folio
on
her
lap
and
looked
at
her
brother
with
a
world
of
apprehension
in
her
faded
eyes
oh
rupert
what
shall
we
do
do
said
mr
landale
quickly
turning
on
her
out
of
his
absorption
you
will
kindly
see
that
suitable
rooms
are
prepared
for
your
aunt
and
cousins
and
you
will
endeavour
if
you
please
to
show
these
ladies
a
cheerful
countenance
as
your
aunt
requests
the
oak
and
the
chintz
rooms
i
suppose
sophia
timidly
suggested
tanty
used
to
say
she
liked
the
aspect
and
i
daresay
the
young
ladies
will
find
it
pleasant
to
look
out
on
the
garden
ay
returned
rupert
absently
he
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
fallen
to
pacing
the
room
presently
a
short
laugh
broke
from
him
tolerably
cool
i
must
say
he
remarked
tolerably
cool
it
seems
to
be
a
tradition
with
that
savenaye
family
when
in
difficulties
to
go
to
pulwick
miss
landale
looked
up
with
relief
perhaps
rupert
would
think
better
of
it
and
make
up
his
mind
to
elude
receiving
the
unwelcome
visitors
after
all
but
his
next
speech
dashed
her
budding
hopes
ay
as
in
the
days
of
their
mother
before
them
when
she
came
here
to
lay
her
eggs
like
a
cuckoo
in
another

nesti

they
had

addled

indeedwe
may
expect
to
have
the
whole

turned

suppose
it
is
a
pretty
assortment

herself

the

incompetence

cried
the
brother
with
a
contained
intensity
of
exasperation
at
which
the
poor
lady
jumped
and
trembled
as
if
she
had
been
struck
all
your
whining
wont
improve
matters
now
listen
to
me
sitting
down

impressively

the

day
do
i
molly
de
savenaye
begin
my
diary
madeleine
writes
to
me
from
bath
that
she
has
purchased
a
very
fine
book
in
which
she
intends
to
set
forth
each
evening
all
that
has
happened
her
since
the
morning
she
advises
me
to
do
so
too
she
says
that
since
real
life
has
begun
for
us
life
of
which
every
succeeding
day
is
not
as
in
the
convent
the
repetition
of
the
previous
day
but
brings
some
new
discovery
pleasure
or
pain
we
ought
to
write
down
and
preserve
their
remembrance
it
will
be
so
interesting
for
us
to
read
when
a
new
life
once
more
begins
for
us
and
we
are
married
besides
it
is
the
fashion
and
all
the
young
ladies
she
knows
do
it
and
she
has
she
says
already
plenty
to
write
down
now
i
should
like
to
know
what
about
when
ought
one
to
start
such
a
record
surely
not
on
a
day
like
this
why
demme
as
mrs
hambledons
nephew
says
what
the
deyvil
have
i
got
to
say
item
i
went
out
shopping
this
morning
with
mrs
hambledon
and
bearing
madeleines
advice
in
mind
purchased
at
kellys
in
sackville
street
an
album
book
bound
in
green
morocco
with
clasp
and
lock
which
mr
kelly
protests
is
quite
secure
item
we
met
captain
segrave
of
the
royal
dragoons
who
was
so
attentive
to
me
at
lady
rigtouns
rout
two
days
ago
he
looked
very
well
on
his
charger
but
how
conceited
when
he
saw
me
he
rolled
his
eyes
and
grew
quite
red
and
then
he
stuck
his
spurs
into
his
horse
that
we
might
admire
how
he
could
sit
it
which
he
did
indeed
to
perfection
mrs
hambledon
looked
vastly
knowing
and
i
laughed
if
ever
i
try
to
fancy
myself
married
to
such
a
man
i
cannot
help
laughing
this
however
is
not
diaryitem
we
returned
home
because
it
began
to
rain
and
to
pass
the
time
here
am
i
at
my
book
but
is
this
the
sort
of
thing
that
will
be
of
interest
to
read
hereafter
i
have
begun
too
late
i
should
have
written
in
those
days
when
i
saw
the
dull
walls
of
our
convent
prison
for
the
last
time
it
seems
so
far
back
now
though
by
the
calendar
it
is
hardly
six
months
that
i
cannot
quite
recall
how
it
felt
to
live
in
prison
and
yet
it
was
not
unhappy
and
there
was
no
horror
in
the
thought
we
both
had
sometimes
then
that
we
should
pass
and
end
our
lives
in
the
cage
it
did
not
strike
us
as
hard
it
seemed
indeed
in
the
nature
of
things
but
the
bare
thought
of
returning
to
that
existence
now
to
resume
the
placid
daily
task
to
fold
up
again
like
a
plant
that
has
once
expanded
to
sun
and
breeze
to
have
never
a
change
of
scene
of
impression
to
look
forward
to
nothing
but
submission
sleep
and
death
oh
it
makes
me
turn
cold
all
over
and
yet
there
are
women
who
of
their
own
will
give
up
the
freedom
of
the
world
to
enter
a
convent
after
they
have
tasted
life
oh
i
would
rather
be
the
poorest
the
ugliest
peasant
hag
toiling
for
daily
bread
than
one
of
these
cold
cloistered
souls
so
that
the
free
air
of
heaven
be
it
with
the
winds
or
the
rain
might
beat
upon
me
so
that
i
might
live
and
love
as
i
like
do
right
as
i
like
ay
and
do
wrong
if
i
liked
with
the
free
will
which
is
my
own
we
were
told
that
the
outer
world
with
all
its
sorrows
and
trials
and
dangershow
i
remember
the
reverend
mothers
words
and
face
and
how
they
impressed
me
then
and
how
i
should
laugh
at
them
nowthat
the
world
was
but
a
valley
of
tears
we
were
warned
that
all
that
awaited
us
if
we
left
the
fold
was
misery
that
the
joys
of
this
world
were
bitter
to
the
taste
its
pleasures
hollow
and
its
griefs
lasting
we
believed
it
and
yet
when
the
choice
was
actually
ours
to
make
we
chose
all
we
had
been
taught
to
dread
and
despise
why
i
wonder
for
the
same
reason
as
eve
ate
the
apple
i
suppose
i
would
if
i
had
been
eve
i
almost
wish
i
could
go
back
now
for
a
day
to
the
cool
white
rooms
to
see
the
nuns
flitting
about
like
black
and
white
ghosts
with
only
a
jingle
of
beads
to
warn
one
of
their
coming
see
the
blue
sky
through
the
great
bare
windows
and
the
shadows
of
the
trees
lengthening
on
the
cold
flagged
floors
hear
the
bells
going
dingdong
dingdong
and
the
murmur
of
the
sea
in
the
distance
and
the
drone
of
the
school
and
the
drone
of
the
chapel
to
go
back
and
feel
once
more
the
dull
sort
of
content
the
calmness
the
rest
but
no
no
i
should
be
trembling
all
the
while
lest
the
blessed
doors
leading
back
to
that
horrible
world
should
never
open
to
me
again
the
sorrows
and
trials
of
the
world
i
suppose
the
reverend
mother
really
meant
it
and
if
i
had
gone
on
living
there
till
my
face
was
wrinkled
like
hers
poor
woman
i
might
have
thought
so
too
in
the
end
and
talked
the
same
nonsense
was
it
really
i
that
endured
such
a
life
for
seventeen
years
o
god
i
wonder
that
the
sight
of
the
swallows
coming
and
going
the
sound
of
the
free
waves
did
not
drive
me
mad
twist
as
i
will
my
memory
i
cannot
recall
that
molly
of
six
months
ago
whose
hours
and
days
passed
and
dropped
all
alike
all
lifeless
just
like
the
slow
tac
tac
tac
of
our
great
horloge
in
the
refectory
and
were
to
go
on
as
slow
and
as
alike
for
ever
and
ever
till
she
was
old
dried
wrinkled
and
then
died
the
real
molly
de
savenayes
life
began
on
the
april
morning
when
that
dear
old
turbaned
fairy
godmother
of
ours
carried
us
poor
little
cinderellas
away
in
her
coach
well
do
i
remember
my
birthday
i
have
read
since
in
one
of
those
musty
books
of
bunratty
that
moths
and
butterflies
come
to
life
by
shaking
themselves
out
one
fine
day
from
a
dulllooking
shapeless
ugly
thing
they
call
a
grub
in
which
they
have
been
buried
for
a
long
time
they
unfold
their
wings
and
fly
out
in
the
sunshine
and
flit
from
flower
to
flower
and
they
look
beautiful
and
happythe
world
the
wicked
world
is
open
to
them
there
were
pictures
in
the
book
the
ugly
grub
below
dreary
and
brown
and
the
lovely
butterfly
in
all
its
colours
above
i
showed
them
to
madeleine
and
said
look
madeleine
as
we
were
and
as
we
are
and
she
said
yes
those
brown
gowns
they
made
us
wear
were
ugly
but
i
should
not
like
to
put
on
anything
so
bright
as
red
and
yellow
would
you
that
is
the
worst
of
madeleine
she
never
realises
in
the
least
what
i
mean
and
she
does
love
her
clothes
that
is
the
difference
between
her
and
me
she
loves
fine
things
because
they
are
fine
and
dainty
and
all
thati
like
them
because
they
make
me
fine
and
yet
how
she
did
weep
when
she
left
the
convent
madeleine
would
have
made
a
good
nun
after
all
she
does
so
hate
anything
ugly
or
coarse
she
grows
quite
white
if
she
hears
people
fighting
if
there
is
a
row
or
a
shindy
as
they
say
here
whereas
tanty
and
i
think
it
all
the
fun
in
the
world
and
would
enjoy
joining
in
the
fray
ourselves
i
believe
if
we
dared
i
know
i
should
it
sets
my
blood
tingling
but
madeleine
is
a
real
princess
a
sort
of
ermine
and
yet
she
enjoys
her
new
life
too
the
beauty
of
it
the
refinement
being
waited
upon
and
delicately
fed
and
clothed
but
although
she
has
ceased
to
weep
for
the
convent
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
she
would
be
there
still
the
only
thing
i
believe
that
could
make
me
weep
now
would
be
to
find
one
fine
morning
that
this
had
only
been
a
dream
and
that
i
was
once
more
the
grub
to
find
that
i
could
not
open
my
window
and
look
into
the
wide
wide
world
over
to
the
long
green
hills
in
the
distance
and
know
that
i
could
wander
or
gallop
up
to
them
as
i
did
at
bunratty
and
see
for
myself
what
lies
beyondsurely
that
was
a
taste
of
heaven
that
day
when
tanty
rose
first
allowed
me
to
mount
her
old
pony
and
i
flew
over
the
turf
with
the
wind
whistling
in
my
earsto
find
that
i
could
not
go
out
when
i
pleased
and
hear
new
voices
and
see
new
faces
and
men
and
women
who
live
each
their
own
life
and
not
the
same
life
as
mine
when
i
think
of
what
i
am
now
and
what
i
might
have
remained
i
breathe
deep
and
feel
like
singing
i
stretch
my
arms
out
and
feel
like
flying
our
aunt
told
us
she
thought
bunratty
would
be
dull
for
us
and
so
it
was
in
comparison
with
this
place
perhaps
this
is
dull
in
comparison
with
what
may
come
for
good
tanty
as
she
likes
us
to
call
her
is
intent
on
doing
great
things
for
us
je
vous
marierai
she
tells
us
in
her
funny
old
french
je
vous
marierai
bien
mes
filles
si
vous
tes
sages
and
she
winks
both
eyes
marriage
that
it
is
quite
evident
is
the
goal
of
every
properly
constituted
young
female
and
every
respectable
person
who
has
the
care
of
said
young
female
is
consequently
bent
upon
her
reaching
that
goal
so
marriage
is
another
good
thing
to
look
forward
to
and
love
that
love
all
the
verses
all
the
books
one
reads
are
so
full
of
that
will
come
to
us
they
say
that
love
is
life
well
all
i
want
is
to
live
but
with
a
grey
past
such
as
we
have
had
the
present
is
good
enough
to
ponder
upon
we
now
can
lie
abed
if
we
have
sweet
dreams
and
pursue
them
waking
and
be
lazy
yet
not
be
troubled
with
the
selfindulgence
as
with
an
enormity
or
we
can
rise
and
breathe
the
sunshine
at
our
own
time
we
can
be
frivolous
and
yet
meet
with
smiles
in
response
dress
our
hair
and
persons
and
be
pleased
with
ourselves
and
with
being
admired
or
envied
yet
not
be
told
horrid
things
about
death
and
corruption
and
skeletons
and
above
alloh
above
all
we
can
think
of
the
future
as
different
from
the
past
as
changing
be
it
even
for
the
worse
as
unknown
and
fascinating
not
as
a
repetition
until
death
of
the
same
dreary
round
in
mrs
hambledons
parlour
here
are
huge
glasses
at
either
end
whenever
you
look
into
them
you
see
a
neverending
chain
of
rooms
with
yourself
standing
in
the
middle
vanishing
in
the
distance
every
one
the
same
with
the
same
person
in
the
middle
only
a
little
smaller
a
little
more
insignificant
a
little
darker
till
it
all
becomes
nothing
it
always
reminds
me
of
lifes
prospects
in
the
convent
i
dislike
that
room
when
i
told
mrs
hambledon
the
reason
why
she
laughed
and
promised
me
that
with
my
looks
and
disposition
my
life
would
be
eventful
enough
i
have
every
mind
that
it
shall





october
18thyesterday
i
woke
up
in
an
amazing
state
of
happiness
though
for
no
particular
reason
that
i
can
think
of
it
could
not
be
simply
because
we
were
to
go
out
for
a
visit
to
the
country
and
see
new
people
and
places
for
i
have
already
learned
to
find
that
most
new
people
are
cut
out
on
the
same
pattern
as
those
one
already
knows
it
must
have
been
rather
because
i
awoke
under
the
impression
of
one
of
my
lovely
dreamssuch
dreams
as
i
have
only
had
since
i
left
my
grub
state
dreams
of
space
air
long
long
views
of
beautiful
scenery
always
changing
always
wider
such
as
swallows
flying
between
sky
and
earth
might
see
under
an
exquisite
and
brilliant
light
till
for
very
joy
i
wake
up
my
cheeks
covered
with
tears
this
time
i
was
sitting
on
the
prow
of
some
vessel
with
lofty
white
sails
and
it
was
cutting
through
the
water
blue
as
the
sky
with
wreaths
of
snowlike
foam
towards
some
unknown
shores
ever
faster
and
faster
and
i
was
singing
to
some
one
next
to
me
on
the
prowsome
one
i
did
not
know
but
who
felt
with
mesinging
a
song
so
perfect
so
sweet
though
it
had
no
human
words
that
i
thought
it
explained
all
the
blue
of
the
heaven
the
freshness
of
the
breeze
the
fragrance
of
the
earth
and
why
we
were
so
eagerly
pressing
onwards
i
thought
the
melody
was
such
that
when
once
heard
it
could
never
be
forgotten
when
i
woke
it
still
rang
in
my
ears
but
now
i
can
no
more
recall
it
how
is
it
we
never
know
such
delight
in
waking
hours
is
that
some
of
the
joy
we
are
to
feel
in
heaven
the
music
we
are
to
hear
and
yet
it
can
be
heard
in
this
life
if
one
only
knew
where
to
go
and
listen
and
this
life
is
beautiful
which
lies
in
front
of
us
though
they
would
speak
of
it
as
a
sorrowful
span
not
to
be
reckoned
it
is
good
to
be
young
and
think
of
the
life
still
to
come
every
moment
is
precious
for
its
enjoyment
and
yet
sometimes
i
find
that
one
only
knows
of
a
pleasure
when
it
is
just
gone
one
ought
to
try
and
be
more
awake
at
each
hour
to
the
happiness
it
may
bring
i
shall
try
and
you
my
diary
shall
help
me
this
is
really
no
diarykeeping
it
is
not
a
bit
like
those
one
reads
in
books
it
ought
to
tell
of
other
people
and
the
events
of
each
day
but
other
people
are
really
very
uninteresting
as
for
events
well
so
far
they
are
uninteresting
too
it
is
only
what
they
cause
to
spring
up
in
our
hearts
that
is
worth
thinking
upon
and
that
is
so
difficult
to
put
in
words
that
mostly
i
spend
my
time
merely
pondering
and
not
writing
last
night
mrs
hambledon
took
me
to
the
play
it
was
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
i
was
full
of
curiosity
it
was
a
long
drama
pretty
enough
and
sometimes
very
exciting
but
i
could
see
that
though
the
actress
was
very
handsome
and
mostly
so
unhappy
as
to
draw
tears
from
the
spectators
there
were
people
especially
some
gentlemen
who
were
more
interested
in
looking
at
the
box
where
i
sat
with
mrs
hambledon
indeed
i
could
not
pretend
when
i
found
myself
before
my
glass
that
night
that
i
was
not
amazingly
prettier
than
that
mrs
colebrook
about
whose
beauty
the
whole
town
goes
mad
when
i
recalled
the
heros
ravings
about
his
matildas
eyes
and
cheeks
and
her
foot
and
her
sylphlike
waist
and
her
raven
hair
i
wondered
what
that
young
man
would
say
of
me
if
he
were
my
lover
and
i
his
persecuted
mistress
the
matilda
was
a
pleasing
person
enough
but
if
i
take
her
point
by
point
it
would
be
absurd
to
speak
of
her
charms
in
the
same
breath
with
mine
oh
my
dear
molly
how
beautiful
i
thought
you
last
night
how
happy
i
should
be
were
i
a
dashing
young
lover
and
eyes
like
yours
smiled
on
me
i
never
before
thought
myself
prettier
than
madeleine
but
now
i
do
lovers
love
mistress
bride
they
talked
of
nothing
else
in
the
play
and
it
was
all
ecstasy
in
their
words
and
nothing
but
misery
in
fact
just
as
the
reverend
mother
would
have
had
it
the
young
man
who
played
the
hero
was
a
very
fine
fellow
and
yet
when
i
conceive
him
making
love
to
me
as
he
did
last
night
to
mrs
colebrook
the
notion
seems
really
too
ludicrous
what
sort
of
man
then
is
it
i
would
allow
to
love
me
i
do
not
mind
the
thought
of
lovers
sighing
and
burning
for
me
as
some
do
now
indeed
or
pretend
to
i
like
to
feel
that
i
can
crush
them
with
a
frown
and
revive
them
with
a
smile
i
like
to
see
them
fighting
for
my
favour
but
to
give
a
man
the
right
to
love
me
the
right
to
my
smiles
the
right
to
me
indeed
i
have
yet
seen
none
who
could
make
me
bear
the
thought
and
yet
i
think
that
i
could
love
and
i
know
that
the
man
that
i
am
to
love
must
be
living
somewhere
till
fate
brings
him
to
me
he
does
not
think
of
me
he
does
not
know
of
me
and
neither
of
us
i
suppose
will
taste
life
as
life
is
till
the
day
when
we
meet
camden
place
bath
november
1stbath
at
last
which
must
please
poor
mrs
hambledon
exceedingly
for
she
certainly
did
not
enjoy
the
transit
i
cannot
conceive
how
people
can
allow
themselves
to
be
so
utterly
distraught
by
illness
i
feel
i
can
never
have
any
respect
for
her
again
she
moaned
and
lamented
in
such
cowardly
fashion
was
so
peevish
all
the
time
on
board
the
vessel
and
looked
so
very
begrimed
and
untidy
and
plain
when
she
was
carried
out
on
bristol
quay
the
captain
called
it
dirty
weather
but
i
thought
it
lovely
and
i
dont
think
i
ever
enjoyed
myself
moreexcept
when
captain
segraves
black
douglas
ran
away
with
me
in
phoenix
park
it
was
beautiful
to
see
our
brave
boat
plough
the
sea
and
quiver
with
anger
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
when
it
was
checked
by
some
great
green
wave
then
gather
itself
again
under
the
wind
and
dash
on
to
the
fight
until
it
conquered
and
when
we
came
into
the
river
and
the
sun
shone
once
more
it
glided
on
swiftly
though
looking
just
a
little
tired
for
a
while
until
its
decks
and
sails
were
dry
and
clean
again
and
i
thought
it
was
just
like
a
bird
that
has
shaken
and
plumed
itself
i
was
sorry
to
leave
it
the
captain
and
the
mate
and
the
sailors
who
had
wrapped
me
up
in
their
great
stiff
tarpaulin
coats
and
placed
me
in
a
safe
corner
where
i
could
sit
out
and
look
were
also
sorry
that
i
should
go
but
it
was
good
to
be
with
madeleine
again
and
tanty
donoghue
who
always
has
such
a
kind
smile
on
her
old
wrinkled
face
when
she
looks
at
me
madeleine
was
astonished
when
i
told
her
i
had
loved
the
storm
at
sea
and
when
i
mimicked
poor
mrs
hambledon
she
says
she
also
thought
she
was
dying
so
ill
was
she
on
her
crossing
and
that
she
was
quite
a
week
before
she
got
over
the
impression
it
seems
odd
to
think
that
we
are
sisters
and
twin
sisters
too
in
so
many
things
she
is
different
from
me
she
has
changed
in
manner
since
i
left
her
she
seems
so
absorbed
in
some
great
thought
that
all
her
words
and
smiles
have
little
meaning
in
them
i
told
her
i
had
tried
to
keep
my
diary
but
had
not
done
much
work
and
when
i
asked
to
see
hers
for
a
model
madeleine
blushed
and
said
i
should
see
it
this
day
year
madeleine
is
in
love
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
that
blush
i
fear
she
is
a
sly
puss
but
there
is
such
a
bustle
around
us
and
so
much
to
do
and
see
i
have
no
time
to
make
her
confess
so
i
said
i
would
keep
mine
from
her
for
that
period
also
it
seems
a
long
span
to
look
ahead
what
a
number
of
things
will
happen
before
this
day
year
bath
november
3rdbath
is
delightful
i
have
only
been
here
two
days
and
already
i
am
what
tanty
in
her
oldfashioned
way
calls
the
belle
already
there
are
a
dozen
sparks
who
declare
that
my
eyes
have
shot
death
to
them
this
afternoon
comes
my
lord
of
manningham
nicknamed
king
of
bath
to
drink
a
dish
of
tea
as
he
has
it
with
his
dear
old
friend
miss
odonoghue
tanty
has
been
here
three
weeks
and
he
has
only
just
discovered
her
existence
and
remembered
their
tender
friendship
of
course
i
know
very
well
what
has
really
brought
him
he
is
lord
derehams
grandfather
on
the
mothers
side
and
lord
dereham
who
is
the
son
of
the
duke
of
wells
is
the
catch
as
mrs
hambledon
vows
of
the
fashionable
world
this
year
and
lord
dereham
has
seen
me
twice
and
is
in
love
with
me
but
as
lord
dereham
is
more
like
a
little
white
rat
than
a
man
and
swears
more
than
he
converseswhich
would
be
very
shocking
if
it
were
not
for
his
lisp
which
makes
it
very
funnyneedless
to
say
my
diary
dear
your
molly
is
not
in
love
with
himhe
has
no
chance
and
so
lord
manningham
comes
to
tea
and
tanty
orders
me
to
remain
and
see
her
old
friend
instead
of
going
to
ride
with
the
widow
hambledon
the
widow
hambledon
and
i
are
everywhere
together
and
she
knows
all
the
most
entertaining
people
in
bath
whereas
madeleine
whom
i
have
hardly
seen
at
all
except
at
night
when
i
am
so
dead
tired
that
i
go
to
sleep
as
soon
as
my
head
touches
the
pillow
i
vow
tantys
manner
of
speech
is
catching
miss
madeleine
keeps
to
her
own
select
circle
and
turns
up
her
haughty
little
nose
at
my
friends
so
now
madeleine
is
punished
for
tanty
and
i
have
had
the
honour
of
receiving
the
king
of
bath
and
i
have
been
vouchsafed
the
stamp
of
his
august
approval
my
dear
miss
odonoghue
he
cried
as
i
curtsied
do
my
senses
deceive
me
or
do
i
not
once
more
behold
murthering
moll
i
thought
you
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
likeness
my
niece
is
indeed
a
complete
odonoghue
says
tanty
amazingly
pleased
likeness
maam
cried
the
old
wretch
bowing
again
and
scattering
his
snuff
all
over
the
place
while
i
sweep
him
another
splendid
curtsey
likeness
maam
why
this
is
no
feeble
copy
no
humble
imitation
tis
murdering
moll
herself
and
glad
i
am
to
see
her
again
and
then
he
catches
me
under
the
chin
and
peers
into
my
face
with
his
dim
wicked
old
eyes
and
so
you
are
murdering
molls
daughter
says
he
chuckling
to
himself
ay
she
and
i
were
very
good
friends
my
pretty
child
very
good
friends
and
that
not
so
long
ago
either
ay
mater
pulchra
filia
pulchrior
but
i
happen
to
be
her
granddaughter
please
my
lord
said
i
and
then
i
ran
to
fetch
him
a
chair
for
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
he
was
going
to
kiss
me
but
though
no
one
has
ever
accused
me
of
speaking
too
modestly
to
be
heard
my
lord
had
a
sudden
fit
of
deafness
and
i
saw
tanty
give
me
a
little
frown
while
the
old
thinghe
must
be
much
older
than
tanty
eventottered
into
a
chair
and
went
on
mumbling
i
was
only
a
boy
in
those
days
my
dear
only
a
boy
as
your
good
aunt
will
tell
you
i
can
remember
how
the
bells
rang
the
three
beautiful
irish
sisters
into
bath
and
i
and
the
other
dandies
stood
to
watch
them
drive
by
the
bells
rang
in
the
belles
in
those
days
my
dear
he
he
he
only
we
used
to
call
them
toasts
then
and
your
mother
was
the
most
beautiful
of
the
three
graceswe
christened
them
the
three
gracesand
by
gad
she
led
us
all
a
pretty
dance
ah
my
lord
says
tanty
and
i
could
see
her
old
eyes
gleam
though
her
tone
was
so
pious
i
fear
we
were
three
wild
irish
girls
indeed
lord
manningham
was
too
busy
ogling
me
to
attend
to
her
your
mother
was
just
such
another
as
you
and
she
had
just
such
a
pair
of
dimples
said
he
you
mean
my
grandmother
shouted
i
in
his
ear
just
for
fun
though
tanty
looked
as
if
she
were
on
pins
and
needles
but
he
only
pinched
my
cheek
again
and
went
on
before
she
had
been
here
a
fortnight
all
the
bucks
in
the
town
were
at
her
feet
and
so
was
i
so
was
i
only
by
gad
i
was
too
young
you
know
as
miss
odonoghue
here
will
tell
you
but
she
liked
me
she
used
to
call
me
her
little
manny
i
declare
i
might
have
married
her
only
there
were
family
reasons
and
i
was
such
a
lad
you
know
and
then
jack
waterpark
some
of
us
thought
she
would
have
had
him
in
the
endbeing
an
irishman
and
a
rich
man
and
a
marquis
to
boothe
gave
her
the
name
of
murthering
moll
because
of
her
killing
eyes
young
ladyhe
he
heand
there
was
ned
cuffe
ready
to
hang
himself
for
her
and
jim
denham
and
old
beau
vernon
ay
and
a
score
of
others
and
then
one
night
at
the
assembly
rooms
after
the
dancing
was
over
and
we
gay
fellows
were
all
together
up
gets
waterpark
he
was
a
little
tipsy
my
dear
and
by
gad
i
can
hear
him
speak
now
with
that
brogue
of
his
boys
he
says
its
no
use
your
trying
for
her
any
more
for
by
god
ive
won
her
and
out
of
his
breastpocket
he
pulls
a
little
knot
of
blue
ribbon
your
mother
my
dear
had
worn
a
very
fine
gown
that
evening
with
little
knots
of
blue
ribbon
all
over
the
bodice
of
it
the
words
were
not
out
of
his
mouth
when
ned
cuffe
starts
to
his
feet
as
white
as
a
sheet
its
a
damned
lie
he
cries
and
out
of
his
pocket
he
pulls
another
little
knot
she
gave
it
to
me
with
her
own
hands
he
cried
and
glares
round
at
us
all
and
then
vernon
bursts
out
laughing
and
flourishes
a
third
little
bow
in
our
eyes
and
i
had
one
too
i
need
not
tell
you
and
so
had
all
the
rest
all
save
a
french
fellowi
forget
his
nameand
it
was
he
she
had
danced
with
the
most
of
all
ah
miss
odonoghue
how
the
little
jades
eyes
sparkle
i
warrant
you
have
never
told
her
the
story
for
fear
she
would
want
to
copy
her
mother
in
other
ways
besides
lookshey
well
my
pretty
give
me
your
little
hand
and
then
i
shall
go
onpretty
little
hand
umumum
and
then
he
kissed
my
hand
the
horrid
snuffy
thing
but
i
allowed
it
for
i
did
so
want
to
hear
how
it
all
ended
and
then
and
then
i
said
and
then
my
dear
this
french
fellow
your
papa
he
must
have
beenso
i
suppose
i
must
not
abuse
him
and
he
was
a
very
fine
young
man
after
all
and
a
man
of
honour
as
wellhe
stood
and
cursed
us
all
you
english
fools
he
said
you
braggardscowards
and
he
seized
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
table
and
with
a
sweep
he
dashed
it
at
us
and
ended
by
flinging
the
empty
glass
in
lord
waterparks
face
it
was
the
neatest
thing
you
ever
saw
for
we
all
got
a
drop
except
waterpark
and
he
got
the
glass
i
challenge
you
all
said
the
frenchman
ill
fight
you
one
by
one
and
i
shall
have
her
into
the
bargain
and
so
he
did
my
dear
he
fought
us
all
one
after
the
other
there
were
five
of
us
he
was
a
devil
with
the
sword
but
ned
cuffe
ran
him
through
for
all
thatand
he
was
a
month
getting
over
it
but
as
soon
as
he
could
crawl
again
he
vowed
himself
ready
for
waterpark
and
weak
as
he
was
he
ran
poor
waterpark
through
the
lungs
some
said
jack
spitted
himself
on
his
swordbut
dead
he
was
anyhow
and
monsieur
your
fatherwhat
was
his
name
kermesomethingwas
off
with
your
mother
before
the
rest
of
us
were
well
out
of
bed
fie
fie
my
lord
said
tanty
you
should
not
recall
old
stories
in
this
manner
gad
maam
i
warrant
this
young
lady
is
quite
ready
to
provide
you
with
a
few
new
ones
chuckled
my
lord
and
as
there
was
no
more
to
be
extracted
from
him
but
foolish
old
jokes
and
dreadful
smiles
i
contrived
to
free
my
pretty
little
hand
and
sit
down
demurely
by
tantys
side
like
the
modest
retiring
young
female
i
should
be
but
my
blood
was
dancing
in
my
veinsthe
blood
of
murthering
molldoddering
old
idiot
as
he
is
lord
manningham
is
right
for
once
i
mean
to
take
quite
as
much
out
of
life
as
she
did
that
indeed
is
worth
being
young
and
beautiful
for
we
know
nothing
of
our
family
save
that
both
father
and
mother
were
killed
in
vende
tanty
never
will
tell
us
anything
about
them
except
their
coats
of
arms
and
i
am
afraid
even
to
start
the
subject
for
she
always
branches
off
upon
heraldry
and
then
we
are
in
for
hours
of
it
but
after
lord
manningham
was
gone
i
asked
her
when
and
how
my
grandmother
died
she
died
when
your
mother
was
born
my
dear
said
tanty
she
was
not
as
old
as
you
are
now
and
your
grandfather
never
smiled
again
or
so
they
said
that
sobered
me
a
little
yet
she
lived
her
life
so
well
while
she
did
live
that
i
who
have
wasted
twenty
precious
years
can
find
in
my
heart
rather
to
envy
than
to
pity
my
beautiful
grandmother





november
5thit
is
three
oclock
in
the
morning
but
i
do
not
feel
at
all
inclined
to
go
to
bed
madeleine
is
sleeping
poor
pretty
pale
madeleine
with
the
tears
hardly
dry
upon
her
cheeks
and
i
can
hear
her
sighing
in
her
sleep
i
was
right
she
is
in
love
and
the
gentleman
she
loves
is
not
approved
of
by
tanty
and
the
upshot
of
it
all
is
we
are
to
leave
dear
bath
delightful
bath
tomorrowtoday
ratherfor
some
unknown
penitential
region
which
our
stern
relative
as
yet
declines
to
name
i
am
longing
to
hear
more
about
it
but
tanty
who
though
she
talks
so
much
can
keep
her
own
counsel
better
than
any
woman
i
know
will
not
give
me
any
further
information
beyond
the
facts
that
the
delinquent
who
has
dared
to
aspire
to
my
sister
is
a
person
of
the
name
of
smith
and
that
it
would
not
do
at
all
i
have
not
the
heart
to
wake
madeleine
to
make
her
tell
me
more
though
i
really
ought
to
pinch
her
well
for
being
so
secretivebesides
my
head
is
so
full
of
my
own
day
that
i
want
to
get
it
all
written
down
and
i
shall
never
have
done
so
unless
i
begin
at
the
beginning
yesterday
then
at
3
oclock
in
the
afternoon
lord
derehams
coach
and
four
came
clattering
up
to
our
door
to
call
for
me
mrs
hambledon
was
already
installed
and
lady
soames
and
a
dozen
other
of
the
fashionables
of
bath
my
little
lord
marquis
had
kept
the
box
seat
for
me
at
which
the
other
ladies
even
my
dear
friend
and
chaperon
looked
rather
green
the
weather
was
glorious
and
off
we
went
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
whips
and
i
knew
i
should
enjoy
myself
monstrously
and
so
i
did
but
it
was
the
drive
back
that
was
the
best
of
all
we
never
started
till
near
nine
oclock
and
lord
dereham
insisted
on
my
sitting
beside
him
againat
which
all
the
ladies
looked
daggers
at
me
and
all
the
gentlemen
daggers
at
him
and
then
we
sang
songs
and
tore
along
uphill
and
down
dale
under
the
beautiful
moonlight
through
the
still
air
till
all
at
once
we
found
we
had
lost
our
way
we
had
to
drive
on
till
we
came
to
an
inn
and
we
could
make
inquiries
there
the
gentlemen
opened
another
hamper
of
wine
and
when
we
set
off
again
i
promise
you
they
were
all
pretty
lively
and
most
of
the
ladies
too
for
the
matter
of
that
as
for
me
who
never
drank
anything
but
milk
or
water
till
six
months
ago
i
have
not
learnt
to
like
wine
yet
so
though
i
sipped
out
of
the
glass
to
keep
the
fun
going
i
contrived
to
dispose
of
the
contents
quietly
over
the
side
of
the
coach
when
no
one
was
looking
it
was
a
drive
to
remember
we
came
to
a
big
hill
and
as
we
were
going
down
it
at
a
smart
pace
the
coach
began
to
sway
then
the
ladies
began
to
screech
and
even
the
men
looked
so
scared
that
i
laughed
outright
lord
dereham
was
perfectly
tipsy
and
he
did
not
know
the
road
a
bit
but
he
drove
in
beautiful
style
and
was
extraordinarily
amusing
as
soon
as
the
coach
took
to
swaying
instead
of
slackening
speed
as
they
all
begged
him
he
lashed
the
horses
into
a
tearing
gallop
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
rest
and
cursing
them
with
the
greatest
energy
grinning
with
rage
and
looking
more
like
a
little
white
rat
than
ever
give
me
the
whip
said
i
and
i
shall
whip
the
team
while
you
drive
cuth
me
cried
he
if
you
are
not
worth
the
whole
coachload
a
dozen
times
over
on
we
went
the
coach
rocked
the
horses
galloped
and
i
knew
at
any
moment
the
whole
thing
might
upset
and
i
flourished
my
whip
and
lashed
at
the
steaming
flanks
and
i
never
felt
what
it
was
to
really
enjoy
myself
before
presently
although
we
were
tearing
along
so
fast
the
coach
steadied
itself
and
went
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
this
it
seems
it
would
never
have
done
had
not
lord
dereham
kept
up
the
pace
and
all
the
rest
of
the
drive
his
lordship
wanted
to
kiss
me
i
was
not
a
bit
frightened
though
he
was
drunk
but
every
time
he
grew
too
forward
i
just
flicked
at
the
horses
with
the
whip
and
i
think
he
saw
that
i
would
have
cracked
him
across
the
face
quite
as
readily
if
he
dared
to
presume
no
doubt
a
dozen
times
during
the
day
i
could
have
secured
a
coronet
for
myself
not
to
speak
of
future
strawberry
leaves
as
my
aunt
says
if
i
had
cared
to
but
who
could
think
of
loving
a
man
like
that
he
can
manage
four
horses
and
he
has
shot
two
men
in
a
duel
and
he
can
drink
three
bottles
of
wine
at
a
sitting
and
when
one
tries
to
find
something
more
to
say
for
him
lo
that
is
all
when
we
at
length
arrived
at
camden
place
for
i
vowed
they
must
leave
me
home
the
first
there
was
the
rarest
sport
my
lords
grooms
must
set
to
blow
the
horns
for
they
were
as
drunk
as
their
master
while
one
of
the
gentlemen
played
upon
the
knocker
till
the
whole
crescent
was
aroused
then
the
doors
opened
suddenly
and
tanty
appears
on
the
threshold
holding
a
candle
her
turban
was
quite
crooked
with
the
birds
of
paradise
over
one
eye
and
i
never
saw
her
old
nose
look
so
hooked
all
the
gentlemen
set
up
a
shout
and
sir
thomas
wrexham
began
to
crow
like
a
cock
for
no
reason
on
earth
that
i
can
think
of
the
servants
were
holding
up
lanterns
but
the
moon
was
nigh
as
bright
as
day
tanty
just
looked
round
upon
them
one
after
another
and
in
spite
of
her
crooked
turban
i
think
they
all
grew
frightened
then
she
caught
hold
of
me
and
just
whisked
me
behind
her
next
she
spied
out
mrs
hambledon
who
had
been
asleep
inside
the
coach
and
now
tumbled
forth
yawning
and
gaping
and
so
madam
cries
tanty
to
her
not
very
loud
but
in
a
voice
that
made
even
me
tremble
so
madam
this
is
how
you
fulfil
the
confidence
i
placed
in
you
a
pretty
chaperon
you
are
to
have
the
charge
of
a
young
lady
though
indeed
considering
your
years
madam
i
might
have
been
justified
in
trusting
you
mrs
hambledon
cut
short
in
the
middle
of
a
loud
yawn
by
this
attack
was
a
sight
to
see
hoightytoighty
maam
she
cried
indignantly
as
soon
as
she
could
get
her
voice
heres
a
fine
todo
it
is
my
fault
of
course
that
lord
dereham
should
mistake
the
road
and
my
fault
too
no
doubt
that
your
miss
should
make
an
exhibition
of
herself
riding
on
the
box
with
the
gentlemen
at
this
hour
of
night
when
i
implored
her
to
come
inside
with
me
were
it
only
for
the
sake
of
common
female
propriety
common
female
indeed
echoed
tanty
with
a
snort
the
poor
child
knew
better
cuth
the
old
cats
theyll
have
each
otherth
eyeth
out
here
cried
my
lord
marquis
interposing
his
little
tipsy
person
between
them
he
had
scrambled
down
the
box
after
me
and
was
listening
with
an
air
of
profound
wisdom
that
made
me
feel
fit
to
die
laughing
dont
you
mind
her
old
lady
he
went
on
addressing
tanty
mith
molly
ith
quite
able
to
take
care
of
herselfdamme
if
sheth
not
aunt
donoghue
turned
upon
him
majestically
and
then
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
you
my
poor
young
man
she
exclaimed
and
i
vow
he
looked
as
sobered
as
if
she
had
flung
a
bucket
of
cold
water
over
him
upon
this
she
retired
and
shut
the
door
and
marched
me
upstairs
before
her
without
a
word
before
my
room
door
she
stopped
mrs
dempsey
has
already
packed
your
sisters
trunks
she
said
in
a
very
dry
way
and
she
will
begin
to
pack
yours
earlyi
was
going
to
say
tomorrowbut
you
keep
such
hours
my
dearit
will
be
today
i
stared
at
her
as
if
she
had
gone
mad
you
and
your
sister
she
went
on
have
got
beyond
me
i
have
taken
my
resolution
and
given
my
orders
and
there
is
not
the
least
use
making
a
scene
and
then
it
came
out
about
madeleine
at
first
i
thought
i
would
go
into
a
great
passion
and
refuse
to
obey
but
after
a
minute
or
two
i
saw
it
was
as
she
said
no
use
tanty
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
then
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
mollify
her
if
i
could
cry
but
i
couldnt
pump
up
a
tear
i
never
can
and
at
last
when
i
went
into
my
room
and
saw
poor
madeleine
who
has
cried
herself
to
sleep
evidently
i
understood
that
there
was
nothing
for
us
but
to
do
as
we
were
told
and
now
i
can
hear
tanty
fussing
about
her
room
stillshe
has
been
writing
toocra
cra
crathis
last
hour
i
wonder
who
to
after
all
there
is
some
fun
in
being
taken
off
mysteriously
we
dont
know
where
i
should
like
to
go
and
kiss
her
but
she
thinks
i

a

no

having
reached
pulwick
since
miss
odonoghues
letter
of

as
mr

described
it
he
drove
over
to
lancaster
on
the
day
appointed
to
meet
the
party
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
through
the
irresistible
management
of
miss
odonoghue
who
put
into
the
promotion
of
her
scheme
all
the
energy
belonging
to
her
branch
of
the
family

the
long
habit
of
authority
of
the
tante

hritage
the
daughters
of
ccile
de
savenaye
returned
to
that
first
home
of
theirs
of
which
they
had
forgotten
even
the
name
mr
landale
had
not
set
eyes
on
his
valuable
relative
for
many
years
but
her
greeting
at
the
first
renewal
of
intercourse
which
took
place
in
the
principal
parlour
of
the
lancaster
inn
was
as
easily
detached
in
manner
as
though
they
had
just
met
again
after
a
trifling
absence
and
she
was
bringing
her
charges
to
his
house
in
accordance
with
a
mutual
agreement
my
dear
rupert
cried
she
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
i
need
not
ask
you
how
you
are
you
look
so
extremely
sleek
and
prosperous
adrians
wide
acres
are
succulent
hey
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
though
to
be
sure
you
are
hardly
large
enough
for
the
breed
you
have
the
true
landale
stamp
on
you
the
unmistakable
landale
style
of
feature
semper
eadem
in
that
sense
at
least
one
can
apply
your
ancient
and
once
worthy
motto
to
you
and
you
know
nephew
since
you
have
conveniently
changed
your
faith
both
to
god
and
king
this
sentiment
strikes
one
as
a
sarcasm
amidst
the
achievements
of
landale
you
backsliders
ah
we
odonoghues
have
better
maintained
our
device
sans
changier
rupert
to
whom
the
wellknown
volubility
of
his
aunt
was
most
particularly
disagreeable
but
who
had
nevertheless
saluted
the
stalwart
old
ladys
cheek
with
much
affection
here
bent
his
supple
back
with
a
sort
of
mocking
gallantry
you
maintain
your
device
permit
me
to
say
my
dear
aunt
as
ostentatiously
in
your
person
as
we
renegade
landales
ourselves
pooh
pooh
i
am
too
old
a
bird
to
be
caught
by
such
chaff
nephew
it
is
pearls
before
i
mean
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
my
dear
keep
it
for
the
young
things
and
indeed
i
see
the
sheeps
eyes
you
have
been
casting
in
their
direction
come
nearer
young
ladies
and
make
your
cousins
acquaintance
beckoning
to
her
nieces
who
arrayed
in
warm
travelling
pelisses
and
beaver
bonnets
of
fashionable
appearance
stood
in
the
background
near
the
fireplace
they
are
very
like
are
they
not
she
continued
twins
always
are
as
like
as
two
peas
and
yet
these
are
as
different
as
day
and
night
when
you
come
to
know
them
madeleine
is
the
eldest
that
is
she
in
the
beaver
fur
molly
prefers
bear
without
their
bonnets
you
will
distinguish
them
by
their
complexion
molly
has
raven
hair
she
is
the
truest
odonoghue
whilst
madeleine
is
fair
blonde
like
her
breton
father
the
sisters
greeted
their
newfound
guardian
each
in
her
own
way
and
in
spite
of
the
disguising
bonnets
and
their
surprising
similarity
of
voice
height
and
build
the
difference
was
more
marked
than
that
of
beaver
and
bear
madeleine
acknowledged
her
kinsmans
greeting
with
a
dainty
curtsey
and
little
halfshy
smile
marked
by
that
air
of
distinction
and
breeding
which
was
her
peculiar
characteristic
molly
however
who
thought
she
had
reasonable
cause
for
feeling
generally
exasperated
and
who
did
not
see
in
mr
rupert
landale
despite
his
good
looks
and
his
good
manner
a
very
promising
substitute
for
her
bath
admirers
nor
in
the
prospect
of
pulwick
a
profitable
exchange
for
bath
came
forward
with
her
bolder
grace
to
flounce
him
a
saucy
reverence
measuring
him
the
while
with
a
certain
air
of
mockery
which
his
thinskinned
susceptibility
was
quick
to
seize
he
looked
back
at
her
down
the
long
tunnel
of
her
bonnet
appraising
the
bloom
and
beauty
within
with
cold
and
curious
gaze
and
then
he
turned
to
madeleine
and
made
to
her
his
courteous
speech
of
welcome
this
was
sufficient
for
miss
molly
who
for
six
months
already
accustomed
to
compel
admiration
at
first
sight
from
all
specimens
of
the
male
sex
that
came
across
her
path
instantly
vowed
a
deadly
hatred
to
her
cousin
and
followed
the
party
into
the
landale
family
coachrupert
preceding
with
a
lady
on
each
armin
a
temper
as
black
as
her
own
locks
it
fell
to
her
lot
to
sit
beside
the
objectionable
relative
on
the
back
seat
while
by
the
right
of
her
minutes
seniority
madeleine
sat
beside
tanty
in
the
front
the
projecting
wings
of
her
headgear
effectively
prevented
her
from
watching
his
demeanour
unless
indeed
she
had
turned
to
him
which
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
but
certain
fugitive
conscious
blushes
upon
the
young
face
in
front
of
her
certain
castings
down
of
long
lashes
and
timid
upward
glances
made
molly
shrewdly
conjecture
that
mr
landale
through
all
the
apparent
devotion
with
which
he
listened
to
tantys
continuous
flow
of
observations
was
able
to
bestow
a
certain
amount
of
attention
upon
her
pretty
neighbour
tanty
herself
conducted
the
conversation
with
her
usual
high
hand
feigning
utter
oblivion
of
the
thundercloud
on
mollys
countenance
and
if
somewhat
rambling
in
her
discourse
nevertheless
contriving
to
plant
her
points
where
she
chose
thus
the
long
drive
wore
to
its
end
the
sun
was
golden
upon
pulwick
when
the
carriage
at
length
drew
up
before
the
portico
miss
sophia
received
them
in
the
hall
in
a
state
of
painful
flutter
and
timidity
she
had
a
constitutional
terror
of
her
aunts
sharp
eyes
and
though
she
examined
her
young
cousins
wistfully
madeleines
unconscious
air
of
dignity
repelled
her
as
much
as
mollys
deliberate
pertness
rupert
conducted
his
aunt
upstairs
and
down
the
long
echoing
corridor
towards
her
apartment
ha
my
old
quarters
quoth
tanty
disengaging
herself
briskly
from
her
escort
to
enter
the
room
and
look
round
approvingly
and
very
comfortable
they
are
and
my
two
nieces
are
next
door
i
see
as
gay
as
chintz
can
make
them
thank
you
nephew
i
shall
keep
you
no
longer
we
shall
dine
shortly
i
feel
sure
well

you

i
was
speaking
to
the
young
ones
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
chat
with
you
my
dear
if
you
have
no
objection
one
door
closed
upon
rupert
as
he
smiled
and
bowed
himself
out
the
other
upon
molly
hustling
her
sister
before
her
tanty
in
the
highest
good
humour
having
accomplished
her
desire
and
successfully
established
a
lodgment
to
use
a
military
term
not
inappropriate
to
such
a
martial
spirit
for
her
troublesome
nieces
in
the
stronghold
of
pulwick
once
more
surveyed
her
surroundings
the
dim
old
walls
the
great
fourpost
bed
consecrated
of
course
by
tradition
to
the
memory
of
some
royal
slumberer
the
damask
hangings
and
the
uncomfortable
chairs
with
the
utmost
favour
ending
up
with
a
humorous
examination
of
the
elongated
figure
hesitating
on
the
hearthrug
be
seated
sophia
i
am
glad
to
stretch
my
old
limbs
after
that
terrible
drive
so
here
we
are
together
again
what
are
you
sighing
for
upon
my
soul
you
are
the
same
as
ever
i
see
the
same
tombstone
on
your
chest
and
blowing
yourself
out
with
sighs
just
as
you
used
that
will
never
give
you
a
figure
my
poor
girl
it
is
no
wonder
you
are
but
skin
and
bones
ah
cant
you
let
the
poor
fellow
rest
in
his
grave
sophia
it
is
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
i
call
it
to
go
on
perpetually
stirring
up
his
ashes
like
that
i
hope
you
mean
to
try
and
be
a
little
more
cheerful
with
those
poor
girls
but
there
i
believe
you
are
never
so
happy
as
when
you
are
miserable
and
its
a
poor
creature
you
would
be
at
any
time
added
the
old
lady
to
herself
after
a
second
thoughtful
investigation
of
miss
landales
countenance
which
had
assumed
an
expression
of
mulishness
in
addition
to
an
increase
of
dolefulness
during
this
homily
here
to
miss
landales
great
relief
the
dying
sunset
wavering
into
crimson
and
purple
from
its
first
glory
of
liquid
gold
attracted
her
aunts
attention
and
miss
odonoghue
went
over
to
the
window
beneath
her
spread
the
quaint
garden
with
its
clipped
box
edges
and
beyond
the
now
leafless
belt
of
trees
upon
the
glimmer
of
the
bay
the
outline
of
scarthey
a
dark
silhouette
rose
fantastically
against
the
vivid
sky
even
as
she
gazed
there
leapt
upon
its
fairy
turret
a
minute
point
of
white
the
jovial
old
countenance
changed
and
darkened
and
adrian
is
still
at
his
fools
game
over
there
i
suppose
she
said
irately
turning
upon
sophia
when
have
you
seen
him
last
how
often
does
he
come
here
i
gather
master
rupert
is
nothing
if
not
the
master
why
dont
you
answer
me

the
dinner
was
as
well
cooked
and
served
a
meal
as
any
under
ruperts
rule
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
and
if
the
young
ladies
failed
to
appreciate
the
floating
island
the
golden
nests
and
silver
web
so
thoughtfully
provided
for
them
tanty
did
ample
justice
to
the
venison
indeed
the
cloud
which
had
been
visible
upon
her
countenance
at
the
beginning
of
dinner
and
which
according
to
that
downright
habit
of
mind
which
rendered
her
so
terrible
or
so
delightful
a
companion
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
began
to
lift
towards
the
first
remove
and
altogether
vanished
over
her
final
glass
of
port
after
dinner
she
peremptorily
ordered
her
grandnieces
into
the
retirement
of
their
bedchambers
unblushingly
alleging
their
exhausted
condition
in
front
of
the
perfect
bloom
of
their
beautiful
young
vigour
she
then
over
a
cup
of
tea
luxuriously
stretching
her
thin
frame
in
the
best
armchair
the
drawingroom
could
afford
gave
rupert
a
brief
code
of
directions
as
to
the
special
attentions
and
care
she
desired
to
be
bestowed
upon
her
wards
during
their
residence
at
pulwick
descanting
generously
upon
their
various
perfections
gliding
dexterously
over
her
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
rid
of
them
herself
and
concluding
with
the
hinteither
pregnant
or
barren
of
meaning
as
he
chose
to
take
itthat
if
he
made
their
stay
pleasant
to
them
she
would
not
forget
the
service
then
as
mr
landale
began
with
apparent
guilelessness
to
put
a
few
little
telling
questions
to
her
anent
the
episodes
which
had
made
bath
undesirable
as
a
residence
for
these
young
paragons
the
old
lady
suddenly
became
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
and
sleepiness
and
professed
herself
ready
to
be
conducted
to
her
bower
immediately





meanwhile
despite
the
moue
de
circonstance
which
molly
thought
it
incumbent
on
her
to
assume
neither
she
nor
madeleine
regretted
their
compulsory
withdrawal
from
the
social
circle
downstairs
madeleine
had
her
own
thoughts
to
follow
up
and
that
these
were
both
engrossing
and
pleasant
was
easily
evident
and
molly
bursting
with
a
sense
of
injury
arising
from
many
causes
desired
a
special
explanation
with
her
sister
which
the
presence
in
and
out
upon
them
of
tantys
woman
had
prevented
her
from
indulging
in
before
dinner
so
here
we
are
at
last
cried
she
indignantly
after
she
had
walked
round
and
severely
inspected
her
quarters
pausing
to
pull
a
lip
of
extreme
disfavour
at
the
handsome
portrait
of
mr
landale
that
hung
between
the
windows
we
are
madeleine
at
last
kidnapped
imprisoned
successfully
disposed
of
in
fact
yes
here
we
are
at
last
echoed
madeleine
abstractedly
warming
her
slender
ankles
by
the
fire
have
you
made
out
yet
what
particular
kind
of
new
frenzy
it
was
that
seized
chre

asked
miss

with
great
emphasis

she
sat
down
at
her
toilettable
you
are
the
cause
of
it
all
my
dear
and
so
you
ought
to
know
it
is
all
very
well
for
tanty
to
pretend
that
i
have
brought
it
on
myself
by
not
coming
home
till
three
oclock
as
if
that

she
continued
looking
round
over
her
shoulder
why
dont
you
say
something
you
lackadaisical
thing
but
madeleine
answered
nought
and
continued
gazing
while
only
the
little
smile
tilting
the
corners
of
her
lips
betrayed
that
she
had
heard
the
petulant
speech
the
smile
put
the
finishing
touch
to
mollys
righteous
anger
brandishing
a
hairbrush
threateningly
she
marched
over
to
her
sister
and
looked
down
upon
the
slender
figure
in
its
clinging
white
dress
with
blazing
eyes
look
here
she
cried
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
i
can
put
up
with
your
slyness
no
longer
how
dare
you
have
secrets
from
me
missyour
own
twin
sister
you
and
i
who
used
never
to
have
a
thought
we
did
not
share
how
dare
you
have
a
lover
and
not
tell
me
all
about
him
what
was
the
meaning
of
your
weeping
like
a
fountain
all
the
way
from
bath
to
shrewsbury
and
then
without
rhyme
or
reason
apparently
smiling
to
yourself
all
the
way
from
there
to
lancaster
you
have
had
a
letter
dont
attempt
to
deny
it
it
is
of
no
use
oh
it
is
base
of
you
it
is
indeed
and
to
think
that
it
is
all
through
you
that
i
am
forced
into
this
exile
through
your
airs
penchs
and
your
sighing
and
dreaming
and
your
mysterous
smith
to
think
that
tonight
this
very
night
is
the
ball
of
the
season
and
we
are
going
to
bed
oh
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
with
nothing
but
a
knave
and
a
fool
to
keep
us
companyfor
i
dont
think
much
of
your
female
cousin
madeleine
and
as
for
your
male
cousin
i
perfectly
detest
himand
all
the
tabbies
of
the
countryside
for
diversion
with
perhaps
a
country
buck
on
high
days
and
holidays
for
a
relish
pah
molly
had
almost
talked
her
illhumour
away
her
energetic
nature
could
throw
off
most
unpleasant
emotions
easily
enough
so
long
as
it
might
have
an
outlet
for
them
she
now
laid
down
the
threatening
brush
and
kneeling
beside
her
flung
both
her
arms
round
madeleines
shoulders
ma
petite
madeleine
she
coaxed
in
the
mother
tongue
tell
thy
little
sister
thy
secrets
a
faint
flush
crept
to
madeleines
usually
creamy
cheeks
a
light
into
her
eyes
she
turned
impulsively
to
the
face
near
hers
then
as
if
bethinking
herself
pursed
her
lips
together
and
shook
her
head
slightly
do
you
remember
ma
chrie
she
said
at
last
that
french
tale
mrs
hambledon
lent
us
in
which
it
is
said
qui

asked
molly
eagerly
her
lips
parted
as
if
to
drink
in
the
expected
confidence
well
replied
the
other
well
perhaps
things
may
not
be
so
bad
after
all
perhaps
rising
from
her
seat
and
looking
at
her
sister
with
a
little
gentle
malice
while
she
too
began
to
disrobe
her
fairer
beauty
for
the
night
some
of
your
many
lovers
may
come
after
you
from
bath
oh
molly
with
a
little
scream
for
molly
with
eyes
flashing
once
more
had
sprung
up
from
her
knees
to
inflict
a
vicious
pinch
upon
the
equivocators
arm
yes
miss
you
shall
be
pinched
till
you
confess
then
flouting
her
with
a
sudden
change
of
mood
i
am
sure
i
dont
want
to
know
your
wonderful
secretseizing
her
comb
and
passing
it
crackling
through
her
hair
with
quite
unnecessary
energymademoiselle

anyhow
it
cannot
be
very
interesting
mrs

fancy
caring
for
a
man
called

if
you
smile
again
like
that
madeleine
i
shall
beat
you
the
two
sisters
looked
at
each
other
for
a
second
as
if
hesitating
on
the
brink
of
anger
and
then
both
laughed
never
mind
i
shall
pay
you
out

quoth
molly
tugging
at
her
black
mane
so
our
lovers
are
to
come
after
us
is
that
it

you
know
madeleine
she
went
on
calming
down
i
almost
regret
now
that
i
would
not
listen
to
young
lord
dereham
simpleton
though
he
be
he
looked
such
a
dreadful
little
fright
that
i
only
laughed
at
him
i
should
have
laughed
at
him
all
my
life
but
it
would
perhaps
have
been
better
than
this
dependence
on
tanty
with
her
sudden
whims
and
scampers
and
whisking
of
us
away
into
the
wilderness
then
i
should
have
had
my
own
way
always
now
its
too
late
tanty
told
me
yesterday
that
she
sees
he
is
a
dissolute
young
man
and
that
his
dukedom
is
only
a
charles
ii
creation
and
we
know
what
that
means
she
added
and
shook
her
head
i
am
sure
i
had
not
a
notion
but
i
shook
my
head
too
and
said
of
course
that
made
it
impossible
i
was
really
afraid
she
would
want
me
to
marry
him
she
was
dreadfully
pleased
and
said
i
was
a
true
odonoghue
oh
dear
i
dont
know
anything
about
love
i
cant
imagine
being
in
love
but
one
thing
is
certain
i
could
never
never
never
allow
a
horrid
little
rat
like
lord
dereham
to
make
love
to
me
to
kiss
me
nor
indeed
any
manoh
horror
how
you
are
blushing
my
dear
come
here
into
the
light
it
would
be
good
for
your
soul
indeed
it
would
to
confess
but
madeleine
burying
her
hot
cheeks
in
her
sisters
neck
and
clasping
her
with
gentle
caresses
was
not
to
be
drawn
from
her
reticence
molly
pushed
her
off
at
last
and
gave
a
hard
little
goodnight
kiss
like
a
birdpeck
very
well
but
you
might
as
well
have
confessed
for
i
shall
find
out
in
the
long
run

who

perhaps

and
a
presentment
the
gallery
of
family
portraits
at
pulwick
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
that
ancient
house
it
was
a
custom
firmly
established
at
the
prioryever
since
the
first
heralds
visitation
in
lancashire
when
some
mooted
point
of
claims
to
certain
quarterings
had
been
cleared
in
an
unexpected
way
by
the
testimony
of
a
wellauthenticated
ancestral
portraitfor
each
successive
representative
to
add
to
the
collection
one
of
the
first
cares
of
every
landale
therefore
on
succeeding
to
the
title
was
to
be
painted
with
his
proper
armorial
and
otherwise
distinguishing
honours
jealously
delineated
and
thus
hung
in
the
place
of
honour
over
the
high
mantelshelf
of
the
gallerydisplacing
on
the
occasion
his
own
immediate
and
revered
predecessor
the
chain
was
consequently
unbroken
from
the
elizabethan
descendants
of
the
first
acquirers
of
ecclesiastical
property
at
pulwick
down
to
the
present
lightkeeper
of

the
late
sir
thomas
appeared
in
all
the
majesty
of
deputylieutenant
colonel
of
militia
magistrate
and
sundry
other
honourable
offices
in
his
due
place
on
the
right
of
the
present
baronet
the
latter
figured
in
a
character
so
strange
and
so
incongruous
that
it
seemed
as
if
one
day
the
dignified
array
of
landalesold
young
middleaged
but
fine
gentlemen
all
of
themmust
turn
their
backs
upon
their
degenerate
kinsman
over
the
chimneypiece
in
the
huge
carvedoak
frame

already
two
centuries
old

trousers

red
piping
of

with
pigtail
and
coarse
open
shirtstood
boldly
forth
as
the
representative
of
the
present
owner
of
pulwick
proud
of
their
long
line
of
progenitors
it
was
a
not
unusual
thing
for
the
landales
to
entertain
their
guests
at
breakfast
in
a
certain
sunny
bowwindow
in
the
portrait
gallery
rather
than
in
the
breakfast
parlour
proper
which
in
winter
unmistakably
harboured
more
damp
than
was
pleasant
it
was
therefore
with
no
surprise
that
miss
landale
received
an
early
order
from
her
brother
to
have
a
fire
lighted
in
the
apartment
sacred
to
the
family
honours
and
the
matutinal
repast
served
there
in
due
course
whether
mr
landale
was
actuated
by
a
regard
for
the
rheumatism
of
his
worthy
relative
or
merely
a
natural
family
pride
or
by
some
other
and
less
simple
motive
he
saw
no
necessity
for
informing
his
docile
housewife
on
the
matter
as
sophia
was
accustomed
to
no
such
condescension
on
his
part
even
in
circumstances
more
extraordinary
she
merely
bundled
out
of
bed
unquestioningly
in
the
darkness
and
cold
of
the
morning
to
see
his
orders
executed
in
the
proper
manner
which
indeed
to
her
credit
was
so
successfully
accomplished
that
tanty
and
her
charges
when
they
made
their
entry
upon
the
scene
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
with
the
comfortable
aspect
of
the
majestic
old
room
mr
landale
examined
his
two
young
uninvited
guests
with
new
keenness
in
the
morning
light
molly
was
demure
enough
though
there
was
a
lurking
gleam
in
her
dark
eye
which
suggested
rather
armed
truce
than
accepted
peace
as
for
madeleine
though
to
be
serene
was
an
actual
necessity
of
her
delicate
nature
there
was
more
than
resignation

the
blushing
radiance
of

smile

bringing
his

survey

close
and

forward
with
a

treacherous
memory
of
a
schoolboy
for
the
impressionbut
portraits
by
different
masters
and
in
different
moods
there
was
something
patronising
in
the
tone
from
so
young
a
man
which
molly
resented
on
the
spot
oh
we
should
be
as
like
as
two
peas
only
that
we
are
as
different
as
day
and
night
as
tanty
says
she
retorted
tossing
her
white
chin
at
her
host
while
miss
odonoghue
laughed
aloud
at
her
favourites
sauciness
and
after
all
said
rupert
as
he
bestowed
his
venerable
relative
on
her
chair
with
an
ineffable
air
of
politeness
contradicted
though
only
for
an
instant
by
the
look
which
he
shot
at
molly
from
the
light
hazel
eyes
tanty
is
not
so
far
wrongthe
only
difference
between
night
and
day
is
the
difference
between
the
brunette
and
the
blonde

a
little
bow

of

one
comes

said
tanty
sitting
down
in
high
good
humour
to
the
innumerable
good
things
in
which
her
epicurean
old
soul
delighted
that
is
about
as
true
a
thing
as
ever
you
said
our
irish
tongues
are
apt
to
get
behind

thing

it
is
there

a
bull
ruperts
sense
of
humour
was
as
keen
as
most
of
his
other
faculties
and
at
the
unconscious
humour
of
this
sally
his
laugh
rang
out
frankly
while
molly
and
madeleine
giggled
in
their
plates
and
miss
odonoghue
chuckled
quietly
to
herself
in
the
intervals
of
eating
and
drinking
content
to
have
been
witty
without
troubling
to
discover
how
sophia
alone
remained
unmoved
by
mirth
indeed
as
she
raised
her
drooping
head
amazed
at
the
clamour
an
unwary
tear
trickled
down
her
long
nose
into
her
tea
she
was
given
to
revelling
in
anniversaries
of
dead
and
gone
joys
or
sorrows
the
one
as
melancholy
to
her
to
look
back
upon
as
the
other
and
upon
this
november
day
now
very
many
years
ago
had
the
ardent
consumptive
rector
first
hinted
at
his
love
and
now
said
miss
odonoghue
who
having
disposed
of
the
most
serious
part
of
the
breakfast
pushed
away
her
plate
with
one
hand
while
she
stirred
her
second
cup
of
wellcreamed
tea
lazily
with
the
other
now
rupert
will
you
tell
me
the
arrangements
you
propose
to
make
to
enable
me
to
see
your
good
brother
rupert
had
anticipated
being
attacked
upon
this
subject
and
had
fully
prepared
himself
to
defend
the
peculiar
position
it
was
his
interest
to
maintain
to
encourage
a
meeting
between
his
brother
and
the
old
lady
to
whom
the
present
position
of
affairs
was
a
grievous
offence
did
not
certainly
enter
into
his
plan
of
action
but
tanty
had
put
the
question
in
an
unexpected
and
slightly
awkward
shape
and
for
a
second
or
two
he
hesitated
before
replying
i
fear
said
he
then
gliding
into
the
subject
with
his
usual
easy
fluency
that
you
will
be
disappointed
if
you
have
been
reckoning
upon
an
interview
with
adrian
my
dear
aunt
the
hermit
will
not
be
drawn
from
his
shell
on
any
pretext
what
cried
tanty
while
her
withered
cheek
flushed
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
my
nephew
sir
adrian
landale
will
decline
to
come
a
few
hundred
yards
to
see
his
old
aunthis
mothers
own
sisterwho
has
come
three
hundred
miles
at
seventy
years
of
age
to
see
him
in
his
own
housein
his
own
house
repeated
the
irate
old
lady
rattling
the
spoon
with
much
emphasis
against
her
cup
if
you
mean
this
rupert
it
is
an
insult
to
me
which
i
shall
never
forgetnever
she
rose
from
her
seat
as
she
concluded
shaking
with
the
tremulous
anger
of
age
for
gods
sake
tanty
cried
rupert
throwing
into
his
voice
all
the
generous
warmth
he
was
capable
of
simulating
do
not
hold
me
responsible
for
adrian
in
this
matter
his
strange
vagaries
are
not
of
my
suggesting
heaven
knows
well
nephew
said
miss
odonoghue
loftily
if
you
will
kindly
send
the
letter
i
am
about
to
write
to
your
brother
by
a
safe
messenger
immediately
i
shall
believe
that
it
is
your
wish
to
treat
me
with
proper
respect
whatever
may
be
adrians
subsequent
behaviour
mr
landales
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
very
genuine
distress
this
was
just
the
one
proof
of
dutiful
attachment
that
he
was
loth
to
bestow
upon
his
cherished
aunt
i
see
how
it
is
he
exclaimed
earnestly
coming
up
to
the
old
lady
and
laying
his
hand
gently
upon
her
arm
you
entirely
misunderstand
the
situation
i
am
not
a
free
agent
in
this
matter
i
cannot
do
what
you
ask
i
am
bound
by
pledge
adrian
is
undoubtedly
more
thanpeculiar
on
certain
points
and
really
i
dare
not
if
i
would
thwart
him
oh
cried
tanty
shooting
off
the
ejaculation
as
from
a
popgun
then
shaking
herself
free
of
ruperts
touch
she
sat
down
abruptly
in
her
chair
again
and
began
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
not
even
in
her
interchange
of
amenities
with
mrs
hambledon
had
molly
seen
her
display
so
much
indignation
you
want
me
to
believe
he
is
mad
i
suppose
she
snapped
at
last
dear
me
no
no
no
responded
the
other
in
his
airy
way
i
did
not
mean
to
go
so
far
as
that
butwell
there
are
very
painful
matters
and
hitherto
i
have
avoided
all
discussion
upon
them
even
with
sophia
my
affection
for
adrian
fiddlesticks
interrupted
tanty
you
meant
something
i
suppose
either
the
mans
mad
or
he
is
not
and
i
for
one
dont
believe
a
word
of
it
the
worst
sign
about
him
that
i
can
see
is
the
blind
confidence
the
poor
fellow
seems
to
put
in
you
here
molly
who
had
been
listening
to
the
discussion
with
all
her
earsanything
connected
with
the
mysterious
personality
of
the
absent
head
of
the
house
was
beginning
to
have
a
special
fascination
for
hergave
an
irrepressible
little
note
of
laughter
rupert
looked
up
at
her
quickly
and
their
eyes
met
hold
your
tongue
miss
cried
miss
odonoghue
sharply
aware
that
she
had
gone
too
far
in
her
last
remark
and
glad
to
relieve
her
oppression
in
another
direction
how
dare
you
laugh
sophia
this
is
a
terrible
thing
your
brother
wants
me
to
believemay
i
ask
what
your
opinion
is
though
ill
not
deny
i
dont
think
that
will
be
worth
much
sophia
glanced
helplessly
at
rupert
but
he
was
far
too
carefully
possessed
of
himself
to
affect
to
perceive
her
embarrassment
come
come
cried
miss
odonoghue
whose
eyes
nothing
escaped
you
need
not
look
at
rupert
you
can
answer
for
yourself
i
supposeyou
are
not
absolutely
a
drivelling
idiotall
the
landales
are
not
ripening
for
lunatic
asylumscollect
your
wits
sophia
i
know
you
have
not
got
any
but
you
have
enough
to
be
able
to
give
a
plain
answer
to
a
plain
question
i
suppose
do
you
think
your
brother
mad
child
god
forbid
murmured
sophia
at
the
very
extremity
of
those
wits
of
which
miss
odonoghue
had
so
poor
an
opinion
oh
no
dear
aunt
not
mad
of
course
not
in
the
least
mad
then
gathering
from
a
restless
movement
of
ruperts
that
she
was
not
upon
the
right
tack
she
faltered
floundered
wildly
and
finally
drew
forth
the
inevitable
pockethandkerchief
to
add
feelingly
if
irrelevantly
from
its
folds
and
indeed
if
i
thought
such
a
calamity
had
really
fallen
upon
usand
of
course
there
are
symptoms
no
doubt
there
are
symptoms
what
are
his
symptomshas
he
tried
to
murder
any
of
you
hey
oh
my
dear
aunt
no
indeed
dear
adrian
is
gentleness
itself
does
he
bite
does
he
gibber
oh
away
with
you
sophia
i
am
sure
i
cannot
wonder
at
the
poor
fellow
wanting
to
live
on
a
rock
between
you
and
rupert
i
am
sure
the
periwinkles
and
the
gulls
must
be
pleasant
company
compared
to
you
that
alone
would
show
i
should
think
that
he
knows
right
well
what
he
is
about
mad
indeed
there
never
was
any
madness
among
the
odonoghues
except
your
poor
uncle
michael
who
got
a
box
on
the
ear
from
a
windmilland
he
wasnt
an
odonoghue
at
all
you
will
be
kind
enough
nephew
to
have
delivered
to
sir
adrian
no
later
than
today
the
letter
which
i
shall
this
moment
indite
to
him
perhaps
said
rupert
if
you
will
only
favour
me
with
your
attention
for
a
few
minutes
first
aunt
and
allow
me
to
narrate
to
you
the
circumstances
of
my
brothers
return
here
and
of
his
subsequent
selfexile
you
will
see
fit
to
change
your
opinion
both
as
regards
him
and
myself
a
selfcontrolled
nature
will
in
the
long
run
rightly
or
wrongly
always
assume
the
ascendency
over
an
excitable
one
the
moderateness
of
ruperts
words
the
coolness
of
his
manner
here
brought
tanty
rapidly
down
from
her
pinnacle
of
passion
certainly
she
said
she
was
not
only
ready
but
anxious
to
hear
all
that
rupert
could
have
to
say
for
himself
and
smoothing
down
her
black
satin
apron
with
a
shaking
hand
the
old
lady
prepared
to
listen
with
as
much
judicial
dignity
as
her
flustered
state
allowed
her
to
assume
rupert
drew
his
chair
opposite
to
hers
and
leant
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
fixed
his
bright
hard
eyes
upon
her
you
remember
of
course
he
began
after
a
moments
pause
how
at
the
time
of
my
poor
fathers
death
adrian
was
reported
to
have
lost
his
life
in
the
vende
warthough
without
authoritative
confirmationat
the
same
time
as
the
fair
and
unhappy
countesse
de
savenaye
to
whose
fortune
he
had
so
chivalrously
devoted
himself
tanty
bowed
her
head
in
solemn
assent
but
molly
watching
with
the
most
acute
attention
felt
her
face
blaze
at
the
indefinable
shade
of
mockery
she
thought
to
catch
upon
the
speakers
curling
lip
it
was
continued
he
the
constant
strain
the
long
months
of
watching
in
vain
for
tidings
that
told
upon
my
father
rather
than
the
actual
grief
of
loss
when
he
died
the
responsibilities
of
the
headship
of
the
house
devolved
naturally
upon
me
the
only
male
representative
left
seemingly
to
undertake
them
the
months
went
by
to
the
most
sanguine
the
belief
in
adrians
death
became
inevitable
our
hopes
died
slowly
but
they
died
at
last
we
mourned
for
him
here
rupert
cast
down
his
eyes
till
the
thick
black
lashes
which
were
one
of
his
beauties
swept
his
cheek
his
tone
was
perfect
in
its
simple
gravity
at
length
urged
thereto
by
all
the
family
if
i
remember
rightly
by
yourself
as
well
dear
aunt
i
assumed
the
title
as
well
as
the
position
which
seemed
mine
by
right
i
was
very
young
at
the
time
but
i
do
not
think
that
either
then
or
during
the
ten
years
that
followed
i
unworthily
filled
my
brothers
place
there
was
a
proud
ring
of
sincerity
in
the
last
words
and
the
old
lady
knew
that
they
were
true
that
during
the
years
of
his
absolute
power
as
well
as
of
his
present
more
restricted
mastership
ruperts
management
of
the
estate
was
unimpeachable
certainly
not
my
dear
rupert
she
said
in
softer
tones
than
she
had
hitherto
used
to
him
no
one
would
dream
of
suggesting
such
a
thingpray
go
on
and
so
pursued
the
nephew
with
a
short
laugh
relapsing
into
that
light
tone
of
banter
which
was
his
most
natural
mode
of
expression
when
one
fine
day
a
hired
coach
clattered
up
sir
rupert
landales
avenue
and
deposited
upon
his
porch
a
tattered
mariner
who
announced
himself
in
melancholy
tones
that
would
have
befitted
the
ghost
no
doubt
many
took
him
for
as
the
rightful
sir
adrian
erroneously
supposed
defunct
i
confess
that
it
required
a
little
persuasion
to
make
me
recognise
my
longlost
brotherand
yet
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
the
missing
heir
had
come
to
his
own
again
the
dead
had
come
back
to
life
well
we
killed
the
fatted
calf
and
all
the
rest
of
itbut
i
need
not
inflict
upon
you
the
narrative
of
our
rejoicing
faith
no
said
tanty
drily
i
can
see
it
with
half
an
eye
you
know
too
i
believe
the
series
of
extraordinary
adventures
or
misadventures
which
had
kept
him
roaming
on
the
high
seas
while
we
at
home
set
up
tablets
to
his
memory
and
wore
our
blacks
as
people
here
call
it
and
cultivated
a
chastened
resignation
there
was
a
good
deal
of
correspondence
going
on
at
the
time
between
pulwick
and
bunratty
if
i
remember
aright
and
you
heard
all
about
adrians
divers
attempts
to
land
in
england
about
his
fight
with
the
kings
men
his
crack
on
the
head
and
final
impressment
at
least
you
heard
as
much
as
we
could
gather
ourselves
adrian
is
not
what
one
would
call
a
garrulous
person
at
the
best
of
times
it
was
really
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
we
managed
to
extract
enough
out
of
him
to
piece
together
a
coherent
tale
well
well
quoth
tanty
with
impatience
you
are
glib
enough
for
two
anyhow
my
dear
all
this
does
not
tell
me
how
adrian
came
to
live
on
a
lighthouse
and
why
you
put
him
down
as
a
lunatic
not
as
a
lunatic
corrected
rupert
gently
merely
as
slightly
eccentric
on
certain
points
though
indeed
if
you
had
seen
him
during
those
first
months
after
his
return
i
think
even
you
with
your
optimistic
spirit
would
have
feared
as
we
did
that
he
was
falling
into
melancholia
thank
heaven
he
is
better
now
but
dear
me
what
we
went
through
i
declare
i
expected
every
morning
to
be
informed
that
sir
adrians
corpse
had
been
found
hanging
from
his
bedpost
or
discovered
in
a
jelly
at
the
bottom
of
the
bluffs
and
indeed
when
at
length
he
disappeared
for
three
days
after
he
had
been
last
observed
mooning
along
the
coast
there
was
a
terrible
panic
lest
he
should
have
sought
a
congenial
and
soothing
end
in
the
embraces
of
the
quicksands
it
turned
out
however
that
he
had
merely
strolled
over
to
scartheywhere
as
you
know
my
father
established
a
beacon
and
installed
a
keeper
to
warn
boats
off
our
shoalsand
finding
the
place
to
his
liking
had
remained
there
regardless
of
our
feelings
tut
tut
said
tanty
but
whether
in
reproof
of
ruperts
flippant
language
or
of
her
elder
nephews
erratic
behaviour
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
determine
of
course
went
on
rupert
smoothly
i
had
resolved
after
a
decent
period
to
remove
my
lares
and
penates
from
a
house
where
i
was
no
longer
master
and
to
establish
myself
with
my
small
patrimony
i
believe
i
ought
to
call
it
matrimony
as
we
younger
children
benefit
by
our
odonoghue
mother
in
an
independent
establishment
but
when
i
first
broached
the
subject
adrian
was
so
vastly
distressed
expressed
himself
so
well
satisfied
with
my
management
of
the
estate
and
begged
me
so
earnestly
to
consider
pulwick
as
my
home
vowing
that
he
himself
would
never
marry
and
that
all
he
looked
forward
to
in
life
was
to
see
me
wedded
and
with
future
heirs
to
the
name
springing
around
me
that
it
would
have
been
actual
unkindness
to
resist
moreover
as
you
can
imagine
adrian
is
not
exactly
a
man
of
business
and
his
spasmodic
interferences
in
the
control
of
the
property
being
already
then
of
a
very
injudicious
nature
i
confess
that
having
nursed
it
myself
for
eleven
years
with
some
success
i
dreaded
to
think
what
it
would
become
under
his
auspices
and
so
i
agreed
to
remain
but
the
position
increased
in
difficulty
adrians
moroseness
seemed
to
grow
upon
him
he
showed
an
exaggerated
horror
of
company
either
flying
from
visitors
as
from
the
pest
and
shutting
himself
up
in
his
own
apartments
or
on
the
few
disastrous
occasions
when
my
persuasions
induced
him
to
show
himself
to
some
old
family
friends
entertaining
them
with
such
unusual
sentiments
concerning
social
laws
the
magistracy
the
government
his
majesty
the
king
himself
that
the
most
extraordinary
reports
about
him
soon
spread
over
the
whole
county
this
was
about
the
timeas
you
may
rememberof
my
own
marriage
here
an
alteration
crept
into
mr
landales
voice
and
molly
looked
at
him
curiously
while
miss
sophia
gave
vent
to
an
audible
sniff
to
be
sure
said
tanty
hastily
comfortably
egotistic
old
ladies
have
an
instinctive
dislike
to
painful
topics
and
that
ruperts
sorrow
for
his
young
wife
had
been
if
selfcentred
and
reserved
of
an
intense
and
prolonged
nature
was
known
to
all
the
family
the
widower
himself
had
no
intention
of
dilating
upon
it
his
wifes
name
he
never
mentioned
and
no
one
could
guess
heavily
as
the
blow
was
known
to
have
fallen
upon
him
the
seething
bitterness
that
her
loss
had
left
in
his
soul
nor
imagine
how
different
a
man
he
might
have
been
if
that
one
strong
affection
of
his
life
had
been
spared
to
soften
it
adrian
fled
from
the
wedding
festivities
as
you
may
remember
for
you
were
our
honoured
guest
at
the
time
and
greatly
displeased
at
his
absence
he
resumed
after
a
few
seconds
of
darkling
reflection
none
of
us
knew
where
he
had
flown
to
for
he
did
not
evidently
consider
his
owls
nest
sufficiently
remote
but
we
had
his
fraternal
blessing
to
sustain
us
and
after
that
he
continued
to
make
periodical
disappearances
to
his
retreat
stopping
away
each
time
longer
and
longer
one
fine
day
he
sent
workmen
to
the
island
with
directions
to
repair
certain
rooms
in
the
keep
and
he
began
to
transfer
thereto
furniture
his
books
and
his
organ
a
dilapidated
little
french
prisoner
next
appeared
on
the
scene
whom
my
brother
had
extracted
from
the
tower
of
liverpool
which
was
then
crammed
with
such
gentry
and
finally
we
were
informed
that
with
this
worthy
companion
sir
adrian
landale
was
determined
to
take
up
his
abode
altogether
at
scarthey
undertaking
the
duties
of
the
recently
defunct
lightkeeper
so
off
he
went
and
there
he
is
still
he
has
extracted
from
us
a
solemn
promise
that
his
privacy
is
to
be
absolutely
respected
and
that
no
communications
or
above
all
visits
are
to
be
made
to
him
occasionally
when
we
least
expect
it
he
descends
upon
us
from
his
tower
upsets
all
my
accounts
makes
the
most
absurd
concessions
to
the
tenants
rides
round
the
estate
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
disappears
again
et
voil
my
dear
aunt
how
we
stand
well
nephew
said
miss
odonoghue
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
am
sure
for
putting
me
au
courant
of
the
family
affairs
it
is
all
very
sadvery
sad
and
very
deplorable
but
but
mr
landale
was
quite
aware
that
tanty
was
not
yet
convinced
to
the
desired
extent
he
therefore
here
interrupted
her
to
play
his
last
cardthat
ace
he
had
up
his
sleeve
in
careful
preparation
for
this
trial
of
skill
with
his
keenwitted
relative
and
to
the
suitable
production
of
which
he
had
been
all
along
leading
rising
from
his
chair
with
slow
deliberate
movement
he
proceeded
as
if
following
his
own
train
of
thought
without
noticing
that
miss
odonoghue
was
intent
on
speech
herself
you
have
not
seen
him
i
believe
since
he
was
quite
a
lad
you
would
have
some
difficulty
in
recognising
him
though
he
bears
like
the
rest
of
us
what
you
call
the
unmistakable
landale
stamp
his
portrait
is
here
by
the
wayduly
installed
in
its
correct
position
that
with
a
laugh
was
one
of
his
freaks
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
up
the
family
traditions
he
saidand
there
you
will
approve
of
him
no
doubt
but
hardly
perhaps
of
the
manner
in
which
he
has
had
that
laudable
intention
carried
out
my
own
portrait
was
of
course
deposed
like
the
original
added
mr
landale
with
something
of
a
sneer
and
now
hangs
meekly
in
some
bedroom
or
otherin
that
if
i
mistake
not
at
present
hallowed
by
my
fair
cousins
presence
well
it
is
good
for
the
soul
of
man
to
be
humbled
as
we
are
taught
to
believe
from
our
earliest
years
tanty
was
fumbling
for
her
eyeglasses
she
was
glad
to
hear
that
adrian
had
remembered
some
of
his
obligations
she
observed
sententiously
as
she
hauled
herself
stiffly
out
of
her
chair
to
approach
the
chimneypiece
it
was
certainly
a
sign
that
he
was
more
mindful
of
his
duties
as
head
of
the
house
than
one
would
expect
from
a
person
hardly
responsible
such
as
rupert
had
represented
him
to
be
and

here
the
glasses
being
adjusted
and
focussed
upon
the
portrait
miss
odonoghue
halted
abruptly
with
a
dropping
jaw
there
is
a
curious
inscription
underneath
the
escutcheon
said
mr
landale
composedly
which
latter
by
the
way
you
may
notice
is
the
only
one
in
the
line
which
has
no
room
for
an
impaled
coat
adrians
way
of
indicating
not
only
that
he
is
single
but
means
to
remain
such
adrian
composed
it
himself
and
indeed
attached
a
marked
importance
to
it
let
me
read
it
for
you
dear
tanty
the
picture
hangs
a
little
high
and
those
curveting
letters
are
hard
to
decipher
it
runs
thus
sir
adrian
william
hugh
landale
lord
of
pulwick
and
scarthey
in
the
county
palatine
of
lancaster
eighth
baronet
born
march
12th
1775
succeeded
to
the
title
and
estate
on
the
10th
february
1799
whilst
abroad
iniquitously
pressed
into
the
kings
service
on
the
day
of
his
return
home
january
2nd
1801
twice
flogged
for
alleged
insubordination
and
only
released
at
last
by
the
help
of
a
friend
after
five
years
of
slavery
died
here
a
space
for
the
date
it
is
a
record
with
a
vengeance
is
it
not
notice
my
brothers
determination
to
die
unmarried
and
to
retire
once
for
all
from
all
or
any
of
the
possible
honours
connected
with
his
position
they
had
all
clustered
in
front
of
the
picture
even
madeleine
roused
from
her
sweet
daydreams
to
some
show
of
curiosity
miss
landales
bosom
heaving
with
such
sighs
as
to
make
the
tombstone
rise
and
fall
like
a
ship
upon
a
stormy
sea
molly
with
an
eagerness
she
did
not
attempt
to
hide
and
miss
odonoghue
still
speechless
with
horror
and
indignation
mr
landale
had
gauged
his
aunts
temperament
correctly
enough
to
one
whose
ruling
passion
was
pride
of
family
this
mockery
of
a
consecrated
family
custom
this
heirloom
destined
to
carry
down
a
record
of
degradation
into
future
generations
was
an
insult
to
the
name
only
to
be
explained
to
her
first
indignation
by
deliberate
maliceor
insanity
and
from
the
breezy
background
of
blue
sky
and
sea
contrasting
as
strangely
with
the
dark
solemnity
of
the
other
portraits
as
did
the
figure
itself
in
its
incongruous
sailor
dress
the
face
of
the
eighth
baronet
looked
down
in
melancholy
gravity
upon
the
group
gathered
in
judgment
upon
him
disgraceful
positively
disgraceful
at
length
cried
the
last
representative
of
the
odonoghues
of
bunratty
in
scandalised
tones
my
dear
rupert
you
should
have
a
curtain
put
up
that
this
exhibition
of
follyof
madness
i
hardly
know
what
to
call
itbe
not
exposed
to
every
casual
visitor
dear
me
dear
me
that
i
should
live
to
see
any
of
my
kin
deliberately
throw
discredit
on
his
family
if
indeed
the
poor
fellow
is
responsible
rupert
my
good
soul
can
you
ascribe
any
reason
for
this
terrible
state
of
affairs

that
blow
on
the
head
in
part
perhaps
said
mr
landale
and
yet
there
have
been
other
causes
at
work
if
i
could
have
a
private
word
in
your
ear
glancing
meaningly
over
his
shoulder
at
the
two
young
girls
who
were
both
listening
though
with
very
different
expressions
of
interest
and
favour
i
could
give
you
my
opinion
more
fully
go
away
now
my
dear
creatures
hereupon
said
miss
odonoghue
promptly
addressing
her
nieces
it
is
a
fine
morning
and
you
will
lose
your
roses
if
you
dont
get
the
air
i
dont
care
if
it
has
begun
to
rain
miss
go
and
have
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
then
young
people
must
have
exercise
well
my
dear
rupert
wellwhen
molly
with
a
pettish
battledore
and
shuttlecock
indeed
had
taken
her
sister
by
the
arm
and
left
the
room
well
my
dear
aunt
the
fact
is
i
believe
my
unhappy
brother
has
never
recovered
fromfrom
his
passion
for
ccile
de
savenaye
that
early
love
affair
so
suddenly
and
tragically
terminatedwell
it
seems
to
have
turned
his
brain
pooh
pooh
why
that
was
twenty
years
ago
dont
tell
me
it
is
in
a
man
to
be
so
constant
in
no
sane
man
perhaps
but
then
you
know
tanty
that
is
just
the
point
remember
the
circumstances
he
loved
her
madly
he
followed
her
lived
near
her
for
months
and
she
was
drowned
before
his
eyes
i
believe
i
never
heard
of
course
any
details
of
that
strange
period
of
his
life
but
we
can
imagine
this
was
a
difficult
vague
subject
to
deal
with
and
mr
landale
wisely
passed
on
moreover
his
behaviour
when
in
this
house
on
his
return
at
first
has
left
me
no
doubt
i
watched
him
closely
he
was
for
ever
haunting
those
rooms
which
she
had
inhabited
when
he
found
her
miniature
in
the
drawingroom
he
went
first
as
white
as
death
then
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
stood
gazing
at
it
i
am
not
exaggerating
for
a
whole
hour
without
moving
and
finally
he
carried
it
off
and
i
know
he
used
to
talk
to
it
in
his
room
and
now
even
if
i
had
not
given
my
poor
brother
my
word
of
honour
never
to
disturb
his
chosen
solitude
i
should
have
felt
it
a
heavy
responsibility
to
promote
a
meeting
which
would
inevitably
bring
back
past
memories
in
a
troublous
manner
upon
him
in
fact
were
he
to
come
across
the
children
of
his
dead
loveabove
all
molly
who
must
be
startlingly
like
her
motherwhat
might
the
result
be
i
hardly
like
to
contemplate
it
the
human
brain
is
a
very
delicately
balanced
organ
my
dear
aunt
and
once
it
gets
ever
so
slightly
out
of
order
one
cannot
be
too
careful
to
avoid
risk
he
finished
his
say
with
an
expressive
gesture
of
the
hand
miss
odonoghue
remained
for
a
moment
plunged
in
reflection
during
which
the
cloud
upon
her
countenance
gradually
lifted
it
is
a
strange
thing
she
said
at
last
but
constancy
seems
to
run
in
the
family
there
is
no
denying
that
here
is
sophia
a
ridiculous
spectacleand
you
yourself
my
dear
rupert
and
now
poor
adrian
too
and
his
case
of
mere
calflove

one
would
have
thought

into

you
know
returned
mr
landale
who
had
winced
at
his
aunts
allusion
to
himself
and
now
spoke
in
the
most
unemotional
tone
he
could
assume
especially
if
it
is
well
fostered
in
its
youth
and
i
suppose
said
miss
odonoghue
with
a
faint
smile
you
think
i
ought
to
know
all
about
bulls
she
again
put
up
her
glasses
to
survey
the
portrait
with
critical
deliberation
after
which
recommending
him
once
more
strenuously
to
have
a
curtain
erected
she
observed
that
it
would
break
her
heart
to
look
at
it
one
moment
longer
and
requested
to
be
conducted
from
the
room
mr
landale
could
not
draw
any
positive
conclusion
from
his
aunts
manner
of
receiving
his
confidence
nor
determine
whether
she
had
altogether
grasped
the
whole
meaning
of
what
he
had
intended
delicately
to
convey
to
her
concerning
his
brothers
past
as
well
as
present
position
but
he
had
said
as
much
as
prudence

xiii
the
distant
light
in
spite
of
their
first
petulant
or
dolorous
anticipation
and
of
the
contrast
between
the
even
tenor
of
country
life
and
the
constant
stream
of
amusement
which
young
people
of
fashion
can
find
in
a
place
like
bath
the
two
girls
discovered
that
time
glided
pleasantly
enough
over
them
at
pulwick
instead
of
the
gloomy
northern
stronghold
their
novelfed
imagination
had
pictured
the
more
dismally
as
their
sudden
removal
from
town
gaieties
savoured
distantly
of
punishment
at
the
hand
of
their
irate
aunt
they
found
themselves
delivered
over
into
a
bright
admirablyordered
house
replete
with
things
of
beauty
comfortable
to
the
extremity
of
luxury
and
allowed
in
this
place
of
safety
to
enjoy
almost
unrestricted
liberty
the
latter
privilege
was
especially
precious
as
the
sisters
at
that
time
had
engrossing
thoughts
of
their
own
they
wished
to
pursue
and
found
more
interest
in
solitary
roamings
through
the
wide
estate
than
in
the
company
of
the
hosts
on
the
fifth
day
miss
odonoghue
took
her
departure
her
own
travelling
coach
had
rumbled
down
the
avenue
bearing
her
and
her
woman
away
in
its
polished
yellow
embrace
her
flat
trunk
strapped
behind
and
the
goodnatured
old
face
nodding
out
of
the
window
till
molly
and
madeleine
standing
a
little
disconsolate
upon
the
porch
to
watch
her
departure
could
distinguish
even
the
hooked
nose
no
longer
mr
landale
upon
his
mettled
grey
a
gallant
figure
as
molly
herself
was
forced
to
admit
in
his
boots
and
buckskins
had
cantered
in
the
dust
alongside
intent
upon
escorting
his
aged
relative
to
the
second
stage
of
her
journey
that
night
almost
for
the
first
time
since
their
arrival
there
was
no
company
at
dinner
and
the
young
guests
understood
that
the
household
would
now
fall
back
into
its
ordinary
routine
but
without
the
small
flutter
of
seeing
strangers
or
tantys
lively
conversation
the
social
intercourse
soon
waned
into
exceeding
dulness
and
at
an
early
hour
miss
molly
rose
and
withdrew
to
her
room
pretexting
a
headache
for
which
mr
landale
with
his
usual
high
courtesy
affected
deep
concern
as
she
was
slowly
ascending
the
great
oaken
staircase
she
crossed
moggie
the
gatekeepers
daughter
who
in
her
character
of
fostersister
to
one
of
the
guests
had
been
specially
allotted
to
them
as
attendant
during
the
remainder
of
their
visit
to
pulwick
molly
thought
that
the
girl
eyed
her
hesitatingly
as
if
she
wished
to
speak
well
moggie
she
asked
stopping
on
her
way
oh
please
miss
said
the
buxom
lass
blushing
and
dropping
a
curtsey
renny
potter
please
miss
is
up
at
our
lodge
tonight
he
dont
care
to
come
to
the
ouse
so
much
miss
but
when
he
heard
about
you
miss
you
could
have
knocked
him
down
with
a
feather
he
was
so
surprised
and
that
excited
miss
we
have
never
seen
him
so
and
hes
so
set
on
being
allowed
to
see
ye
both
molly
as
yet
failed
to
connect
any
memories
of
interest
with
the
possessor
of
the
patronymic
mentioned
but
the
next
phrase
mentioned
aroused
her
attention
he
is
sir
adrians
servant
now
miss
and
goes
back
yonder
to
the
island
that
is
where
the
master
lives
tomorrow
morning
but
he
would
be
so
happy
to
see
the
young
ladies
before
he
goes
if
the
liberty
were
forgiven
he
says
he
was
servant
to
the
madam
your
mother
miss
well
moggie
answered
miss
molly
smiling
if
that
is
all
that
is
required
to
make
renny
potter
happy
it
is
very
easily
done
tell
renny
potter
tomorrow
morning
and
she
proceeded
on
her
way
pondering
while
the
successful
emissary
pattered
down
to
the
lodge
in
high
glee
to
gather
her
reward
in
her
sweethearts
company





when
later
on
madeleine
joined
her
sister
she
found
her
standing
by
the
deep
recessed
window
the
curtains
of
which
were
drawn
back
resting
her
head
on
her
hand
against
the
wainscot
and
gazing
abroad
into
the
night
she
approached
and
passing
her
hand
round
mollys
waist
looked
out
also
again
at
your
window
it
is
a
beautiful
night
and
the
view
very
lovely
said
molly
and
indeed
the
moon
was
riding
high
in
a
deep
blue
starry
heaven
and
shimmered
on
the
strip
of
distant
sea
visible
from
the
windows
yes
but
yesterday
the
night
was
not
fine
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
blackness
and
it
was
the
same
the
day
before
and
yet
you
stared
out
of
this
window
as
you
have
every
night
since
our
coming
it
is
strange
to
see
you
so
what
is
it
why
dont
you
tell
me
madeleine
said
molly
suddenly
after
a
lengthy
pause
i
am
simply
haunted
by
that
light
over
yonder
the
light
of
scarthey
there
is
a
mystery
about
those
ruins
on
which
i
keep
meditating
all
day
long
i
want
to
know
more
it
draws
me
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
now
to
set
sail
and
land
there
all
unknown
to
any
one
and
see
what
manner
of
life
is
led
where
that
light
is
burning
but
madeleine
merely
gave
a
pout
of
little
interest
what
do
you
think
you
would
find
a
halfwitted
middleaged
man
mooning
among
a
litter
of
books
with
an
old
woman
and
a
little
frenchman
to
look
after
him
why
mr
landale
himself
takes
no
trouble
to
conceal
that
his
poor
brother
is
an
almost
hopeless
lunatic
mr
landale
molly
began
with
much
contempt
but
she
interrupted
herself
and
went
on
simply
mr
landale
is
a
very
fine
gentleman
with
very
superior
manners
he
speaks
like
a
printed
bookbut
for
all
that
i
would
like
to
know
madeleine
laughed
the
demon
of
curiosity
has
a
hold
of
you
molly
remember
the
fable
they
made
us
repeat
de
loin
cest
quelque
chose
et
de
prs
ce
nest
rien
now
you
shall
go
straight
into
your
bed
and
not
take
cold
and
miss
madeleine
after
authoritatively
closing
the
curtains
kissed
her
sister
and
was
about
to
commence
immediate
disrobing
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
shagreencovered
book
lying
open
on
the
table
so
your
headache
was
your
diaryhow
i
should
like
to
have
a
peep
i
daresay
said
molly
sarcastically
and
then
sat
down
and
pen
in
hand
began
to
reread
her
nights
entry
now
and
then
casting
a
tantalising
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
her
sister
the
lines
in
the
flowing
convent
hand
ran
thus
aunt
odonoghue
left
us
this
morning
and
so
here
we
are
planted
in
pulwick
and
she
has
achieved
her
plan
fully
but
what
is
odd
is
that
neither
madeleine
nor
i
seem
to
mind
it
now
what
has
come
over
madeleine
is
her
secret
and
she
keeps
it
close
but
that
i
should
like
being
here
is
strange
indeed
and
yet
every
day
something
happens
to
make
me
feel
connected
with
pulwicksomething
more
i
mean
than
the
mere
fact
that
we
were
born
here
so
many
of
the
older
people
greet
me
at
first
as
if
they
knew
methey
all
say
i
am
so
like
the
madam
they
dont
see
the
same
likeness
in
madeleine
for
all
her
grand
air
there
was
mrs
mearson
the
gatekeeper
was
struck
in
amazement
and
the
old
housekeeper
whenever
she
has
an
opportunity
tries
to
entertain
me
about
the
beautiful
foreign
lady
and
the
grand
times
they
had
at
pulwick
when
she
was
here
and
sir
tummas
was
still
alive
but
though
we
are
made
to
feel
that
we
are
more
than
ordinary
guests
it
is
not
on
account
of
mr
landale
but
on
account
of
sir
adrianthe
master
as
they
call
him
whom
we
never
see
and
whom
his
brother
would
make
out
to
be
mad
why
is
he
so
anxious
that
sir
adrian
should
not
know
that
aunt
rose
has
brought
us
here
he
seemed
willing
enough
to
please
her
and
yet
nothing
that
she
could
say
of
her
wish
could
induce
him
even
to
send
a
messenger
over
to
the
rock
and
now
we
may
be
here
all
these
two
months
and
never
even
have
caught
a
sight
of
the
master
i
wonder
if
he
is
still
like
that
portraitwhether
he
bears
that
face
still
as
he
now
sits
all
alone
brooding
as
his
brother
says
up
in
those
ruined
chambers
while
the
light
burns
calm
and
bright
in
the
tower
what
can
this
man
of
his
have
to
say
to
me
molly
dotted
her
last
forgotten
i
blotted
it
closed
and
carefully
locked
the
book
then
rising
she
danced
over
to
her
sister
and
forced
her
into
a
pirouette
and
now
she
cried
gaily
our
dear
old
tanty
is
pulling
on
her
nightcap
and
weeping
over
her
posset
in
the
stuffy
room
at
lancaster
regretting
me
and
i
should
be
detesting
her
with
all
my
energies
for
leaving
me
behind
her
were
it
not
that
just
at
present
i
actually
find
pulwick
more
interesting
than
bath
madeleine
lifted
her
heavylidded
eyes
a
little
wonderingly
to
her
sisters
face
as
she
paused
in
her
gyration
what
fly
stings
thee
now
she
inquired
in
french
you
do
not
tell
me
about
your
wounds
my
dear
those
wounds
which
little
dan
cupid
has
made
upon
your
tender
heart
with
his
naughty
little
arrow
and
which
give
you
such
sweet
pain
apparently
that
you
revel
in
the
throes
all
day
long
and
yet
i
am
a
good
child
you
shall
guess
if
you
guess
aright
i
shall
tell
you
so
now
begin
they
stood
before
the
fire
and
the
leaping
tongues
of
light
played
upon
their
white
garments
madeleines
nightgear
scarcely
more
treacherously
telltale
of
her
slender
womans
loveliness
than
the
evening
robe
that
clung
so
closely
to
the
vigorous
grace
of
mollys
lithe
young
figure
the
elder
whose
face
bore
a
blush
distinct
from
the
reflected
glow
of
the
embers
fell
to
guessing
as
commanded
a
little
wildly
you
begin
to
find
the
beau
cousin
rupert
a
little
more
interesting
than
you
anticipated
bah
cried
molly
with
a
stamp
of
her
sandalled
foot
it
is
not
possible
to
guess
worse
he
is
more
insufferable
to
me
hour
by
hour
i
think
him
kind
and
pleasant
returned
madeleine
simply
ah
because
he
makes
sweet
eyes
at
you
i
supposeyet
noi
express
myself
badlyhe
could
not
make
anything
sweet
out
of
those
hard
hard
eyes
of
his
but
he
is
verywhat
they
call
here
in
englandattentive
to
you
and
he
looks
at
you
and
ponders
you
over
when
you
little
think
ityou
poor
innocentlost
in
your
dream
of

smith
there
i
will
not
tease
you
guess
again
you
are
pleased
to
remain
here
because
you
are
a
true
weathercockbecause
you
like
one
thing
one
day
another
the
nextbecause
the
country
peace
and
quiet
is
soothing
to
you
after
the
folly
and
noise
of
the
great
world
of
bath
and
dublin
and
reminds
you
refreshingly
as
it
does
me
of
our
happy
convent
days
the
glimmer
of
a
dainty
malice
lurked
in
the
apparent
candour
of
madeleines
grave
blue
eyes
and
from
thence
spread
into
her
pretty
smile
at
the
sight

then
i
give
it
up
you
have
some
mischief
on
foot
of
that
at

i
am
sure
no

madeleine
you
heard
all
that
that
gallant
gentleman
you
think
so
highly
ofyour
cousin
rupert
my
dear
it
was
a
little
way
of
mollys
to
throw
the
responsibility
of
anything
she
did
not
like
even
to
an
obnoxious
relationship
upon
another
persons
shoulders
narrated
of
his
brother
sir
adrian
and
how
he
persuaded
tanty
that
he
was
as
you
said
just
now
a
hopeless
madman
but
yeshe
does
mad
things
said
the
elder
twin
a
little
wonderingly
well
madeleine
it
is
a
vile
lie
i
am
convinced
of
it
but
my
darling
look
here
madeleine
there
is
something
behind
it
all
i
attacked
that
creature
that
rag
you
cannot
call
her
a
woman
that
female
cousin
of
yours
sophia
and
i
pressed
her
hard
too
but
she
could
not
give
me
a
single
instance
about
sir
adrian
that
is
really
the
least
like
insanity
and
last
night
when
the
young
fool
who
escorted
me
to
dinner
coventry
his
name
was
told
me
that
every
one
says
sir
adrian
is
shut
up
on
the
island
and
that
his
french
servant
is
really
his
keeper
and
that
it
was
a
shame
rupert
was
not
the
eldest
brother
i
quite
saw
the
sort
of
story
master
rupert
likes
to
spreaddont
interrupt
please
when
you
were
woolgathering
over
the
fire
last
night
in
the
lively
and
companionable
way
permit
me
to
remark
in
parenthesis
that
you
have
adopted
of
late
and
you
thought
i
was
with
tanty
i
had
marched
off
with
my
flat
candlestick
to
the
picture
gallery
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
socalled
lunatic
i
dragged
over
a
chair
and
lit
the
candles
in
the
candelabra
each
side
of
the
chimneypiece
and
then
standing
on
my
perch
still
i
held
up
my
own
torch
and
i
saw
the
sailor
really
well
i
think
he
has
a
beautiful
face
and
that
he
is
no
more
mad
than
i
am
but
he
looks
so
sad
so
sad
i
longed
to
make
those
closed
lips
part
and
tell
me
their
secret
and
as
i
was
looking
and
dreaming
my
dear
just
as
you
might
i
heard
a
little
noise
and
there
was
rupert
only
a
few
yards
off
surveying
me
with
such
an
angry
gazeugh
with
a
shiver
i
hate
such
ways
he
came
in
upon
me
with
soft
steps
like
some
animal
look
at
his
portrait
there
madeleinestay
i
shall
hold
up
the
light
as
i
did
last
night
to
sir
adriansee
it
flickers
and
glimmers
and
makes
him
seem
as
if
he
were
aliveoh
i
wish
he
were
not
hanging
in
front
of
our
beds
staring
out
at
us
with
those
eyes
you
think
them
very
fine
i
daresay
that
is
because
his
lashes
are
as
thick
and
dark
as
a
womansbut
the
look
in
them
my
deardo
you
know
what
it
reminds
me
of
of
the
beautiful
cruel
greyhound
we
saw
at
the
coursing
at
that
place
near
bunratty
you
remember
just
before
they
started
the
hare
when
he
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
looking
out
across
the
plain
i
can
never
forget
the
expression
of
those
yellowcircled
eyes
and
when
i
see
rupert
look
at
you
as
if
he
were
fixing
something
in
the
far
distance
it
gives
me
just
the
feeling
of
horror
and
sickness
i
had
then
you
remember
how
dreadful
it
was
rupert
makes
me
think
of
a
greyhound
altogether
he
is
so
lithe
and
so
cleancut
and
so
full
of
eagerness
a
sort
of
trembling
eagerness
underneath
his
seeming
quiet
and
i
think
he
could
be
cruel
molly
paused
with
an
unusually
grave
and
reflective
look
madeleine
yawned
a
little
not
at
all
impressed
how
you
exaggerate
she
said
well
what
happened
when
he
came
in
and
caught
you
the
poor
man
i
suppose
he
thought
you
were
setting
the
house
on
fire
my
dear
i
turned
as
red
as
a
poppy
and
began
blowing
out
all
my
illumination
feeling
dreadfully
guilty
and
then
he
helped
me
off
my
chair
with
such
an
air
of
politeness
that
i
could
have
struck
him
with
pleasure
but
i
soon
gathered
my
wits
again
and
vexed
with
myself
for
being
a
ninny
i
just
dropped
him
a
little
curtsey
and
said
ive
been
examining
my
mad
cousin
well
and
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
asked
me
smiling
his
abominable
smile
but
i
can
keep
my
thoughts
to
myself
as
well
as
other
people
i
think
he
is
very
handsome
i
answered
and
then
i
wagged
my
head
and
added
poor
fellow
just
as
if
i
thought
he
was
really
mad
poor
fellow
said
cousin
rupert
still
with
his
smile
whereupon
we
interchanged
goodnights
and
he
ceremoniously
reconducted
me
to
my
door
what
was
he
spying
after
me
for
like
that
my
dear
your
cousin
has
a
bad
consciencebut
i
can
spy
tooi
have
been
questioning
the
servants
today
and
some
of
the
people
on
the
estate
oh
molly
come
dont
be
so
shocked
it
was
diplomatically
of
course
but
i
am
determined
to
find
out
the
truth
well
so
far
from
looking
upon
sir
adrian
as
a
lunatic
they
all
adore
him
it
seems
to
me
he
comes
here
periodicallyonce
every
three
months
or
soand
it
is
like
the
kings
justices
you
knowst
louis
of
francehe
redresses
all
wrongs
and
listens
to
grievances
and
gives
alms
and
counsel
and
every
one
can
come
with
his
story
down
to
the
poorest
wretch
on
the
estate
and
they
certainly
gave
me
to
understand
that
they
would
fare
pretty
hardly
under
mr
landale
if
it
were
not
for
that
mild
beneficent
restraining
influence
in
his
tower
yonder
it
is
very
romantic
do
you
know
you
like
romance
madeleine
i
wonder
if
sir
adrian
will
come
over
while
we
are
here
oh
i
hope
i
hope
he
will
i
shall
never
rest
till
i
have
seen
him
silly
child
said
madeleine
and
so
that
is
the
reason
you
are
glad
to
remain
here
even
so
my
dear
answered
the
other
skipped
into
the
big
fourpost
bed
carefully
ascertained
and
selected
the
softest
pillow
and
then
smiling
sweetly
at
her
sister
from
under
a
frame
of
dark
curls
let
her
white
lids
drop
over
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
and
so
intimated
she
desired
to
sleep

an
hour
not

earlywhen
molly
awoke
from
a
tangle
of
fantastic
dreams
in
which
the
haunting
figure
of
her
waking
thoughts
the
hermit
of
scarthey
appeared
to
her
in
varied
shapes
as
an
aweinspiring
saintly
ascetic
with
long
white
hair
as
a
young
beautiful
imprisoned

even
as
a
ragged
imbecile
staring
vacantly
at
a
lantern
somewhere
in
a
dismal
seacave
the
last
vision
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
the
girl
under
the
impression
of
so
disgusting
a
disillusion
remained
for
a
while
pondering
and
yawning
before
making
up
her
mind
to
exchange
warmth
and
featherbed
for
her
appointment
without
but
the
shafts
of
light
growing
through
the
chinks
in
the
shutters
ever
brighter
and
more
full
of
dancing
motes
decided
her
a
beautiful
morning

said
leaning
over

of

get
up

awoke
smiled
with
her
usual
exquisite
serenity
of

and
politely
refused

to
no

madeleine
was
luxuriously
comfortable
and
was
not
to
be
disturbed
either
mentally
or
bodily
and
molly
aware
of
the
resisting
power
of
will
hidden
under
that
soft
exterior
at
length
petulantly
desisted
and
wrapped
up
in
furs
with
hands
plunged
deep
into
the
recesses
of
a
gigantic
muff
soon
sallied
forth
herself
alone
into
the
park
halfway
down
the
avenue
she
met
blueeyed
moggie
with
round
face
shining
out
of
the
sharp
exhilarating
atmosphere
like
a
small
sun
the
damsel
was
overcome
with
blushes
and
rapture
at
her
young
mistresss
unexpected
promptitude
in
carrying
out
her
promise
and
ran
back
to
warn
her
sweetheart
of
that
ladys
approach





as
molly
drew
near
the
keepers
lodgea
sort
of
doric
temple
quaintly
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
hedgeenclosed
garden
and
halfburied
under
thicklyclustering
interlacing
creepersfrom
the
side
of
the
enormous
nest
of
evergreen
foliage
there
emerged
in
a
state
of
high
excitement
strenuously
subdued
a
short
squarebuilt
man
none
other
than
ren
laptre
whilst
between
the
boughs
of
the
gardenhedge
peeped
forth
the
bashful
ruddy
face
of
the
lady
of
his
fancy
eager
to
watch
the
interview
ren
ran
forward
then
stopped
a
few
paces
away
hat
in
hand
scraping
and
bowing
in
the
throes
of
an
overwhelming
emotion
that
strove
hard
with
humility
ah
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
he
ejaculated
between
spells
of
amazed
staring
and
seemed
unable
to
bring
forth
another
word
and
so
you
have
known
my
mother
ren
said
miss
molly
in
her
native
tongue
with
a
smile
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
of
the
french
words
rens
face
grew
pale
under
its
bronze
and
the
tears
he
had
so
strongly
combated
glistened
in
his
eyes
if
i
had
not
heard
last
night
he
said
at
length
that
these
ladies
had
come
backit
was
moggie
mearson
who
told
me
who
was
foster
sister
to
you
or
was
it
mademoiselle
your
sister
and
proud
she
is
of
itif
i
had
not
known
that
the
young
ladies
were
here
again
when
i
saw
mademoiselle
i
would
have
thought
that
my
lady
herself
had
returned
to
us
may
the
good
god
have
her
soul
ah
to
think
that
i
should
ever
see
her
again
in
the
light
of
the
sun
he
stopped
suffocated
with
the
sob
that
his
respect
would
not
allow
him
to
utter
but
molly
who
had
had
other
objects
in
view
when
she
rose
from
her
couch
this
cold
windy
morning
than
to
present
an
objective
to
a
servingmans
emotion
now
thought
the
situation
had
lasted
long
enough
for
her
enjoyment
and
determined
to
put
an
end
to
it
eh
bien
ren
she
said
gaily
or
should
i
call
you
monsieur
potter
which
by
the
way
is
a
droll
name
for
a
frenchman
i
am
very
glad
to
see
that
you
are
pleased
to
see
me
if
you
would
care
to
have
some
talk
with
me
you
may
attend
me
if
you
like
but
i
freeze
standing
here
stamping
her
feet
one
after
the
other
on
the
hard
ground
i
must
absolutely
walk
and
you
may
put
on
your
hat
again
please
for
it
is
very
cold
for
you
too
she
added
snuggling
into
her
muff
and
under
her
fur
tippet
the
man
obeyed
after
another
of
his
quaint
salutes
and
as
molly
started
forward
followed
her
respectfully
a
pace
in
rear
i
daresay
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
have
a
little
talk
with
a
compatriot
in
your
own
tongue
all
english
as
you
may
have
grown
said
the
young
lady
presently
and
as
moggie
has
told
me
that
you
were
in
my
mothers
service
there
is
a
whole
volume
of
things
which
i
believe
you
alone
can
relate
to
me
you
shall
tell
me
all
that
one
day
but
what
seems
to
me
the
most
curious
first
of
all
is
your
presence
here
we
ourselves
are
only
at
pulwick
by
chance
mademoiselle
said
ren
in
an
earnest
voice
if
you
knew
the
whole
story
you
would
soon
understand
that
since
it
was
not
to
be
that
i
should
remain
the

mademoiselles
father
or
of
madame
who
followed
him
to
heaven
notwithstanding
all
our
efforts
to
preserve
her
it
is
but
natural
that
i
should
attach
myself
since
he
would
allow
it
to
my
present
master
mr
landale
asked
molly
affecting
ignorance
no
mademoiselle
cried
the
frenchman
hotly
my
master
is
sir
adrian
had
mr
landale
remained
the
lord
of
this
place
i
should
have
been
left
to
die
in
my
prisonor
at
least
have
remained
there
until
this
spring
for
it
seems
there
is
peace
again
and
the
tower
of
liverpool
is
empty
now

ren
said
molly
turning
her
face
beautifully
glowing
from
the
caress
of
the
keen
air
eagerly
to
her
companion
and
he
nothing
loth
to
let
loose
a
naturally
garrulous
tongue
in
such
company
and
on
such
a
theme
started
off
upon
a
long
story
illustrated
by
rapid
gesticulation
i
will
tell
you
cried
he
and
plunged
into
explanation
with
more
energy
than
coherence
it
was
like
this
i
had
been
already
two
years
in
that
prison
we
were
some
hundreds
of
prisoners
and
it
was
a
cruel
place
a
cruel
place
mademoiselle
almost
as
bad
as
that
where
we
were
shut
up
my
master
and
i
together
years
before
at
la
rochelleand
that
i
will
tell
you
if
you
wish
afterwards
i
had
been
taken
by
the
marine
conscription
when
their
republic
became
the
french
empire
and
a
sailor
i
was
then
just
as
i
heard
later
as
sir
adrian
also
was
at
the
time
but
that
i
did
not
know
you
understand
for
they
took
all
those
that
lived
on
the
coast
now
i
had
only
served
with
the
ship
six
months
when
she
was
taken
by
the
english
and
as
i
say
we
were
sent
to
the
prison
in
liverpool
where
we
found
so
many
others
who
had
been
already
there
for
years
when
i
heard
it
was
liverpool
i
knew
it
was
a
place
near
pulwick
and
i
at
once
thought
of
mr
landale
not
him
of
course
they
now
call
mr
landale
but
him
who
had
followed
my
mistress
madame
your
mother
to
help
to
fight
the
republicans
in
the
old
time
and
i
thought
i
was
saved
i
knew
he
would
get
me
out
if
it
was
possible
to
get
any
one
out
for
you
see
i
thought
his
honour
was
home
again
after
we
had
been
beaten
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
for
my
lady
we
had
contrived
to
find
an
english
ship
to
take
him
home
and
he
had
gone
back
as
i
thought
mademoiselle
well
a
prisoner
becomes
cunning
and
besides
i
had
been
in
prison
before
i
managed
to
make
up
a
letter
and
as
i
knew
already
some
english
i
ended
by
persuading
a
man
to
carry
it
to
pulwick
for
me
it
was
a
long
way
and
i
had
no
money
but
i
made
bold
to
assure
him
that
mr
landaleoh
no
not
this
one
ren
interrupted
himself
again
with
a
gesture
eloquent
of
resentful
scorn
but
my
master
i
assured
the
man
that
he
would
receive
recompence
from
him
you
see
mademoiselle
i
knew
his
heart
was
so
good
that
he
would
not
allow
your
mothers
servant
to
rot
in
the
tower
but
days
afterwards
the
man
came
back
oh
he
was
angry
terribly
angry
with
me
and
said
he
should
pay
me
outand
so
he
did
but
it
is
useless
to
tell
you
how
he
had
been
to
pulwick
he
said
and
had
seen
mr
landale
mr
landale
never
knew
anything
of
any
french
prisoner
and
refused
to
give
any
money
to
the
messenger
ah
mademoiselle
it
was
very
sad
i
had
not
signed
my
letter
for
fear
of
its
getting
into
wrong
hands
but
i
spoke
of
many
things
which
i
knew
he
could
not
have
forgotten
and
now
i
thought
that
he
would
not
trouble
his
mind
about
such
a
wretch
as
rentriple
brute
that
i
was
to
conceive
such
thoughts
i
should
have
deserved
to
remain
there
for
ever
i
did
remain
mademoiselle
more
than
three
years
many
and
many
died
as
for
me
i
am
hard
but
i
thought
i
should
never
never
walk
free
again
nor
would
i
mademoiselle
these
seven
years
but
for
him
he
came
then
said
the
girl
with
sympathetic
enthusiasm
she
was
listening
with
attention
carried
away
by
the
speakers
earnestness
and
knew
instinctively
to
whom
the
him
and
the
he
referred
he
came
said
ren
with
much
emphasis
of
course
he
camethe
moment
he
knew
and
after
a
moment
of
halfsmiling
meditation
he
pursued
it
was
one
mayday
and
there
was
some
sun
and
there
was
a
smell
of
spring
in
the
air
which
we
felt
even
in
that
dirty
place
ah
how
i
remember
me
of
it
all
i
was
sitting
against
the
wall
in
the
courtyard
with
two
others
who
were
bretons
like
you
and
me
mademoiselle
shifting
with
the
sun
now
and
then
for
you
must
know
a
prisoner
loves
the
sun
above
all
and
there
we
only
had
it
a
few
hours
in
the
day
even
when
it
did
shine
i
was
carving
some
stickheads
and
breadplates
in
woodthe
only
thing
i
could
do
to
put
a
little
more
than
bread
into
our
own
platters
with
a
grin
and
whistling
whistling
for
if
you
cant
be
gay
it
is
best
to
play
at
it
well
that
day
into
our
courtyard
there
was
shown
a
tall
manand
i
knew
him
at
once
though
he
was
different
enough
in
his
fine
coat
and
hat
and
boots
from
the
time
when
i
had
last
seen
him
when
he
was
like
me
in
rags
and
with
a
woollen
cap
on
his
head
and
no
stockings
under
his
shoesi
knew
him
at
once
and
when
i
saw
him
i
stood
still
with
my
mouth
round
but
not
whistling
more
my
blood
went
phizz
phizz
all
over
my
body
and
suddenly
something
said
in
my
head
ren
he
has
come
to
look
for
you
he
was
searching
for
some
one
for
he
went
round
with
the
guardian
looking
into
each
mans
face
and
giving
money
to
all
who
beggedand
seeing
that
they
all
got
up
and
surrounded
him
and
he
gave
them
each
a
piece
but
i
could
not
get
up
it
was
as
if
some
one
had
cut
out
my
knees
and
my
elbows
and
that
was
how
he
saw
me
the
sooner
he
noticed
i
remained
there
looking
at
him
like
a
dog
saying
nothing
when
he
saw
me
he
stood
a
moment
quite
quiet
and
without
pretending
anything
he
came
to
me
and
looked
down
smilingbut
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
know
this
man
he
said
to
the
guardian
pretending
to
be
astonished
why
this
is
ren
laptre
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
here
ren
laptre
says
he
and
then
he
smiled
again
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
i
have
come
at
last
ren
and
once
more
as
if
to
explain
i
have
only
lately
come
back
to
england
in
a
gentle
way
all
full
of
meaning
i
dont
know
what
took
me
but
i
cried
like
an
infant
in
my
cap
and
the
guardian
and
some
of
the
others
laughed
but
when
i
looked
up
again
his
eyes
shone
also
he
looked
so
good
so
kind
mademoiselle
that
it
was
as
if
i
understood
in
words
all
he
meant
but
thought
better
not
to
say
at
the
time
then
he
spoke
to
the
guardian
who
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
after
saying
have
good
courage
ren
laptre
and
giving
me
the
rest
of
his
money
he
went
awaybut
i
knew
i
was
not
forgotten
and
i
was
so
happy
that
the
black
black
walls
were
no
more
black
and
i
sang
not
for
pretence
this
time
ah
no
and
i
spent
all
my
money
in
buying
a
dinner
for
those
at
our
end
of
the
prison
and
we
even
had
wine
you
may
be
sure
we
drank
to
his
happiness
here
the
man
carried
away
by
his
feelings
seized
his
hat
and
waved
it
in
the
air
then
ashamed
of
his
ebullition
halted
and
glanced
diffidently
at
the
young
lady
but
molly
only
smiled
in
encouragement
well
and
then
she
asked
well
mademoiselle
he
resumed
it
was
long
before
i
saw
him
again
but
i
kept
good
courage
as
i
was
told
one
day
at
last
the
guardian
came
to
fetch
me
and
took
me
to
the
governors
cabinet
and
my
master
was
therei
was
told
that
my
release
had
been
obtained
though
not
without
trouble
and
that
sir
adrian
landale
of
pulwick
priory
had
gone
warranty
for
me
that
i
should
not
use
my
liberty
to
the
prejudice
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
england
and
that
i
was
to
be
grateful
to
sir
adrian
i
almost
laughed
at
him
mademoiselle
oh
he
took
care
to
advise
me
to
be
grateful
and
here
ren
paused
ironically
but
there
was
a
quiver
on
his
lips
ah
he
little
knew
monsieur
the
governor
that
when
my
master
had
taken
me
to
an
inn
and
the
door
was
closed
over
the
private
room
he
who
had
looked
so
grand
and
careless
before
the
governor
took
me
by
both
hands
and
then
in
his
fine
clothes
embraced
meme
the
dirty
prisonerjust
as
he
did
when
he
left
me
in
the
old
days
and
was
as
poor
and
ragged
as
i
was
and
let
me
weep
there
on
his
breast
for
i
had
to
weep
or
my
heart
would
have
broken
but
i
wander
mademoiselle
you
only
wanted
to
know
how
i
came
to
be
in
his
service
still
that
is
how
it
was
as
i
tell
you
molly
was
moved
by
this
artless
account
of
fidelity
and
gratitude
and
as
she
walked
on
in
attentive
silence
ren
went
on
it
was
then
his
honour
made
me
know
how
only
by
accident
and
months
after
his
own
return
he
chanced
to
hear
of
the
letter
that
some
one
had
sent
to
mr
landale
from
the
tower
of
liverpool
and
that
mr
landale
had
said
he
knew
nothing
of
any
french
prisoner
and
had
thought
it
great
impudence
indeed
and
how
hemy
masterhad
suddenly
thought
though
my
letter
had
been
destroyed
that
it
might
be
from
me
the
servant
of
my
lady
your
mother
and
his
old
companion
in
arms
for
his
honour
will
always
call
me
so
he
could
not
sleep
he
told
me
till
he
had
found
out
he
started
for
liverpool
that
very
night
and
having
discovered
that
it
was
me
mademoiselle
he
never
rested
till
he
had
obtained
my
liberty





walking
slowly
in
the
winter
sunshine
the
one
talking
volubly
the
other
intently
listening
the
odd
pair
had
reached
a
rising
knoll
in
the
park
where
under
the
shelter
of
a
cluster
of
firs
stood
a
row
of
carved
stone
seats
that
had
once
been
sedillas
in
the
dismantled
priory
church
from
this
secluded
spot
could
be
obtained
the
most
superb
view
of
the
whole
countryside
at
the
end
of
the
green
gentlysloping
stretch
of
pastureland
which
extended
broken
only
by
irregular
clusters
of
trees
down
to
the
low
cliffs
forming
the
boundary
of
the
strand
lay
the
wide
expanse
of
brown
sand
with
its
streamlets
and
salt
pools
scintillating
under
the
morning
sun
further
in
the
western
horizon
a
crescent
of
deep
blue
sea
sharply
defined
under
a
lighter
blue
sky
and
fringed
landwards
with
a
straggling
border
of
foam
advanced
slowly
to
the
daily
conquest
of
the
golden
bay
in
the
midst
of
that
frame
the
eye
was
irresistibly
drawn
as
to
the
chief
object
in
the
picture
to
the
distant
rock
of
scartheya
green
patch
with
the
jagged
red
outline
of
the
ruins
clear
cut
against
the
sky
since
this
point
of
view
in
the
park
had
been
made
known
to
her
on
the
first
day
when
she
was
piloted
through
the
grounds
molly
had
more
than
once
found
her
way
to
the
sedillas
yielding
to
the
fascination
of
the
mysterious
island
and
in
order
to
indulge
in
the
fancies
suggested
by
its
everchanging
aspect
at
the
fall
of
day
the
red
glow
of
the
sinking
sun
would
glint
through
the
dismantled
windows
and
against
the
flaming
sky
the
ruins
would
stand
out
black
and
grim
suggesting
nought
but
abandonment
and
desolation
until
suddenly
as
the
gloom
gathered
upon
the
bay
the
light
of
the
lamp
springing
to
the
beacon
tower
would
reverse
the
impression
and
bring
to
mind
a
picture
of
faithful
and
patient
watching
when
the
sun
was
still
in
the
ascendant
the
island
would
be
green
and
fresh
to
the
gaze
evoking
no
dismal
impression
and
as
the
rays
glanced
back
from
the
two
or
three
glazed
windows
and
from
the
roofed
beacontower
the
little
estate
wore
a
look
of
solid
security
and
privacy
in
spite
of
its
crumbling
walls
which
was
almost
as
tantalising
to
her
romantic
curiosity
it
was
with
ulterior
motives
therefore
that
she
had
again
wended
her
way
to
the
knoll
this
sunny
breezy
morning
she
now
sat
down
and
let
her
eyes
wander
over
the
wide
panorama
whilst
ren
stood
at
a
humble
distance
looking
with
eyes
of
delight
from
her
to
the
distant
abode
of
his
master
and
now
you
live
with
sir
adrian
in
that
little
isle
yonder
said
she
at
length
how
came
it
that
you
never
sought
to
go
back
to
your
country
there
was
the
war
then
mademoiselle
and
it
was
difficult
to
return
but
there
has
been
peace
these
six
months
insisted
molly
yes
mademoiselle
though
i
only
learned
it
yesterday
but
then
bah
what
is
that
his
honour
needs
me
i
have
stopped
with
him
seven
years
and
my
faith
i
shall
stop
with
him
for
ever
there
was
a
long
silence
does
any
one
know
asked
molly
at
length
with
a
vague
air
of
addressing
the
trees
mindful
as
she
spoke
of
the
manner
in
which
mr
landale
had
practically
dismissed
her
and
her
sister
at
a
certain
point
of
his
version
of
his
brothers
history
why
sir
adrian
has
shut
himself
up
in
that
place
instead
of
living
at
the
hall
all
this
time
a
certain
dignity
seemed
to
come
over
the
servants
squat
figure
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
very
simply
his
honest
eyes
fixed
upon
the
girls
face
i
am
only
his
humble
servant
mademoiselle
and
it
is
enough
for
me
that
it
is
his
pleasure
to
live
alone
you
are
indeed
faithful
said
molly
with
a
little
generous
flush
of
shame
at
this
peasants
delicacy
compared
to
her
own
curiosity
and
after
another
pause
she
added
pensively
but
tell
me
does
sir
adrian
never
leave
his
solitude
i
confess
i
should
like
to
meet
one
who
had
known
my
mother
who
could
talk
of
her
to
me
ren
looked
at
the
young
girl
with
a
wistful
countenance
as
though
the
question
had
embarked
him
on
a
new
train
of
thought
but
he
answered
evasively
his
honour
comes
rarely
to
pulwickrarely
molly
with
a
little
movement
of
pique
rose
abruptly
from
her
seat
but
quickly
changing
her
mood
again
she
turned
round
as
she
was
about
to
depart
and
smiling
thank
you
ren
she
said
and
held
out
her
dainty
hand
which
he
blushing
engulfed
in
his
great
paw
i
am
going
in
i
am
dreadfully
hungry
we
shall
be
here
two
months
or
more
and
i
shall
want
to
see
you
again

if
you
come
back
to
pulwick
she
walked
quickly
away
towards
the
house
ren
followed
the
retreating
figure
with
a
meditative
look
so
long
as
he
could
keep
her
in
sight
then
turned
his
gaze
to
the
island
and
there
stood
lost
in
a
deep
muse
regardless
of
the
fact
that
his
sweetheart
moggie
was
awaiting
a
parting
interview
at
the
lodge
and
that
the
tide
that
would
wait
for
no
man
was
swelling
under
his
boat
upon
the
beach





a
sudden
resolution
was
formed
in
mollys
mind
as
the
immediate
result
of
this
conversation
and
she
framed
her
behaviour
that
morning
solely
with
a
view
to
its
furtherance
breakfast
was
over
when
glowing
from
her
morning
walk
she
entered
the
diningroom
but
regardless
of
mr
landales
pointedly
elaborate
courtesy
in
insisting
upon
a
fresh
repast
being
brought
to
her
his
sarcastically
overacted
solicitude
intended
to
point
out
what
a
deal
of
avoidable
trouble
she
gave
to
the
household
molly
remained
perfectly
gracious
and
ate
the
good
things
plaintively
set
before
her
by
miss
landale
with
the
most
perfect
appetite
and
good
humour
she
expatiated
in
terms
of
enthusiasm
on
the
beauty
of
the
estate
and
the
delight
of
her
morning
exploration
and
concluded
this
condescending
account
of
her
doings
in
which
the
meeting
with
ren
did
not
figure
with
a
request
that
mr
landale
should
put
horses
at
the
disposal
of
herself
and
her
sister
for
a
riding
excursion
that
very
afternoon
and
with
determined
energy
she
carried
the
point
declaring
despite
his
prognostications
of
coming
bad
weather
that
the
sunshine
would
last
the
day
in
this
wise
was
brought
about
the
eventful
ride
which
cost
the
life
of
lucifer
and
introduced
such
heartstirring
phantasmagories
into
the
even
tenor
of
sir
adrian
landales
seclusion





that
evening
the
news
rapidly
spread
throughout
pulwick
that
the
cruel
sands
of
the
bay
had
secured
yet
another
victim
in
an
almost
fainting
condition
speechless
with
horror
and
hardly
able
yet
to
realise
to
the
full
her
own
anguish
madeleine
was
conducted
by
the
terrified
groom
through
the
howling
wind
and
drenching
rain
back
to
the
priory
and
there
between
the
fearful
outcries
of
miss
landale
and
the
deep
frowning
gravity
of
her
brother
the
man
stammered
out
his
talehow
the
young
lady
when
the
rain
first
began
had
insisted
notwithstanding
his
remonstrances
upon
taking
the
causeway
to
the
island
and
how
it
was
actually
by
force
that
he
prevented
the
other
lady
from
following
so
soon
as
she
understood
the
danger
into
which
her
sister
was
running
there
was
no
use
he
had
thought
explained
the
man
half
apologetically
for
two
more
to
throw
away
their
lives
just
for
no
good
that
way
and
so
they
had
sat
on
their
horses
and
watched
in
terror
as
well
as
they
could
through
the
torrents
of
rain
they
had
seen
in
the
distance
lucifer
break
from
the
young
ladys
control
and
swerve
from
the
advancing
sea
and
then
had
come
the
great
gust
that
blew
the
rain
and
the
sand
in
their
faces
and
set
their
horses
dancing
and
when
they
could
see
again
all
traces
of
horse
and
rider
had
disappeared
and
there
lay
nothing
before
them
but
the
advancing
tide
though
the
island
and
its
tower
were
still
just
visible
through
the
storm
no
amount
of
crossexamination
could
elicit
any
further
information
the
girls
impulse
seemed
to
have
been
quite
sudden
and
she
had
only
laughed
back
at
the
groom
over
her
shoulder
upon
his
earnest
shout
of
warning
though
she
had
probably
expected
them
to
follow
her
and
as
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
calamity
which
had
ensued
and
no
possible
rescue
even
of
the
body
he
had
returned
home
at
once
to
bring
the
disastrous
news
madeleine
had
been
carried
completely
unconscious
to
her
bed
but
presently
miss
sophia
was
summoned
to
her
side
as
the
girl
showed
signs
of
returning
animation
and
rupert
was
left
alone
he
fell
to
pacing
the
room
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
complicated
and
farreaching
reflections
beyond
doubt
he
was
shocked
and
distressed
by
the
sudden
and
horrible
disaster
and
yet
as
an
undercurrent
to
these
first
natural
thoughts
there
ran
presently
a
distinct
notion
that
he
would
have
felt
the
grievousness
of
it
more
keenly
had
madeleine
perished
in
that
cruel
manner
and
her
sister
survived
to
bring
the
tale
home
the
antagonism
which
his
cousin
in
all
the
insolence
of
her
young
beauty
and
vigorous
selfesteem
had
shown
for
him
had
been
mutual
he
had
instinctively
felt
that
she
was
an
enemy
and
more
than
thata
danger
to
him
this
danger
was
now
removed
from
his
path
and
by
no
intervention
or
even
desire
of
his
own
the
calamity
which
had
struck
the
remaining
sister
into
such

altogether
the
sum
of
his
meditations
was
assuming
a
not
unpleasing
aspect
and
the
undercurrent
in

assumed
almost
the
nature
of

was

would
have
to

and
render
an
account
of

short
trust

not

on
the
wrong

that

this

scrambled
upon
the
desolate
island
under
the
rain
that
beat
me
like
the
lashes
of
a
whip
pushing
against
a
wind
that
bellowed
and
rushed
as
though
determined
to
thrust
me
back
to
the
waters
i
had
cheated
of
their
prey
my
only
thoughts
were
for
succour
and
shelter
such
warm
shelter
such
loving
welcome
it
was
of
course
impossible
that
i
could
for
a
moment
have
anticipated
conceive
my
dear
diary
the
feelings
of
a
poor
semidrowned
wanderer
shivering
with
cold
with
feet
torn
by
cruel
stones
who
suddenly
emerges
from
howl
and
turmoil
into
a
warm
quiet
room
to
be
received
as
a
long
and
eagerly
expected
guest
whose
advent
brings
happiness
whose
presence
is
a
highly
prized
favour
in
fact
not
as
one
who
has
to
explain
her
intrusion
but
as
one
who
in
the
situation
holds
the
upper
hand
herself
and
this
was
my
welcome
from
him
whose
absence
from
pulwick
was
more
haunting
than
any
presence
i
can
think
of
of
course
i
knew
him
at
once
even
had
i
not
expected
to
see
himhad
i
not
come
to
seek
him
in
facti
should
have
known
him
at
once
from
the
portrait
whose
melancholy
wideopen
eyes
had
followed
me
about
the
gallery
but
i
had
not
dreamed
to
see
him
so
little
altered
now
apart
from
the
dress
if
he
is
in
any
way
changed
from
the
picture
it
is
in
a
look
of
greater
youth
and
less
sombreness
the
portrait
is
handsome
but
the
original
is
better
had
it
not
been
so
i
imagine
i
might
have
felt
vastly
different
when
i
was
seized
and
enfolded
andkissed
as
it
was
i
cannot
remember
that
even
at
the
moment
of
this
extraordinary
proceeding
i
was
otherwise
than
pleased
nor
that
the
dark
hints
of
mr
landale
concerning
sir
adrians
madness
returned
to
disturb
my
mind
in
the
least
and
yet
i
found
myself
enveloped
in
great
strong
arms
out
of
which
i
could
not
have
extricated
myself
by
the
most
frantic
effortsalthough
the
folding
was
soft
and
tenderand
i
loved
that
impression
why
i
cannot
say
his
words
of
love
were
not
addressed
to
me
from
his
exclamation
i
knew
that
the
real
and
present
molly
was
not
the
true
object
of
his
sudden
ecstasy
and
yet
i
am
glad
that
this
is
the
first
man
who
has
been
able
to
kiss
molly
de
savenaye
it
is
quite
incomprehensible
i
ought
to
be
indignant
now
the
whole
secret
of
my
reception
is
plain
to
see
and
it
is
pathetic
sir
adrian
landale
was
in
love
with
my
mother
when
she
was
an
unprotected
widow
he
followed
her
to
our
own
country
if
she
had
not
died
soon
after
he
would
have
married
her
what
a
true
knight
must
this
sir
adrian
be
to
keep
so
fresh
for
twenty
years
the
remembrance
of
his
boyish
love
that
when
i
came
in
upon
him
to
look
at
him
with
her
eyes
it
was
to
find
him
pondering
upon
her
and
to
fill
his
soul
with
the
rapturous
thought
that
his
love
had
come
back
to
him
though
i
was
aware
that
all
this
fervour
was
not
addressed
to
me
there
was
something
very
gratifying
in
being
so
like
one
who
could
inspire
such
longlived
passionyes
it
was
unexpectedly
pleasant
and
comforting
to
be
so
received
and
the
tender
care
the
thoughtful
solicitude
next
bestowed
on
the
limp
and
dishevelled
waif
of
the
sea
by
my
beau
tnbreux
were
unmistakably
meant
for
molly
and
no
one
else
whatever
his
first
imaginings
may
have
been
and
they
were
quite
as
interesting
to
receive
the
halfhour
i
spent
cosily
ensconced
by
his
hands
and
waited
upon
by
his
queer
household
was
perhaps
the
best
i
have
ever
known
he
stood
by
the
fireplace
looking
down
from
his
great
height
with
a
wondering
smile
upon
me
i
declare
that
the
loving
kindness
of
his
eyes
which
he
has
wide
grey
and
beautiful
warmed
me
as
much
as
the
pyramid
of
logs
he
had
set
burning
on
the
hearth
i
took
a
good
reckoning
of
the
man
from
under
the
gigantic
collar
in
which
i
felt
my
head
rested
like
a
little
egg
at
the
bottom
of
a
warm
nest
and
so
i
thought
here
is
the
lightkeeper
of
scarthey
island
and
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
he
was
a
more
romanticlooking
person
than
even
in
my
wildest
dreams
i
had
pictured
to
myselfthat
in
fact
i
had
found
out
for
the
first
time
the
man
really
approved
of
and
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
own
clevernessfor
it
was
evident
that
just
as
i
had
suspected
from
rens
reticent
manner
even
by
him
our
existence
at
pulwick
had
not
been
mentioned
to
the
master
and
as
mr
landale
was
quite
determined
to
avail
himself
of
his
brothers
sauvagerie
not
to
let
him
know
anything
about
us
on
his
side
but
for
me
we
might
have
remained
at
and
departed
from
pulwick
unknown
to
the
head
of
the
house
and
what
a
pity
that
would
have
been
now
why
did
not
mr
landale
wish
his
brother
to
know
did
he
think
as
indeed
has
happened
that
the
lightkeeper
would
take
too
kindly
to
the
savenaye
children
or
to
one
of
them
if
so
he
will
be
bien
attrapp
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
my
sudden
and
dramatic
arrival
upon
his
especial
domain
has
made
an
impression
on
him
that
no
meeting
prepared
and
discussed
beforehand
could
have
produced
adrian
landale
may
have
been
in
love
with
our
beautiful
mamma
in
his
boyish
days
but
now
sir
adrian
the
man
is
in
love
with
the
beautiful
molly
that
is
positive
i
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
go
to
sleep
in
the
tower
it
was
too
perfect
to
be
in
bed
in
such
a
place
safe
and
happy
in
the
midst
of
the
rage
i
could
hear
outside
to
have
seen
the
unknown
to
have
found
him
such
as
he
isto
be
under
the
light
what
would
have
happened
if
my
cousin
had
really
been
mad
and
ren
his
keeper
as
that
stupid
countryside
wit
suggested
in
my
ear
the
other
night
at
dinner
it
would
have
been
still
more
of
an
adventure
of
course
but
not
one
which
even
murthering
moll
the
second
can
regret
or
if
he
had
been
a
dirty
untidy
hermit
as
madeleine
thought
that
would
have
spoilt
all
thus
in
the
owls
nest
as
mr
landale
spiteful
creature
called
it
to
tanty
there
lives
not
owl
any
more
than
lunatic
a
polished
gentleman
with
white
exquisite
hands
who
when
he
is
discovered
by
the
most
unexpected
of
visitors
is
shaven
as
smooth
as
rupert
himself
has
the
most
unexceptionable
of
snowy
linen
and
oldfashioned
it
is
true
but
most
wellfitting
clothes
as
for
the
entertainment
for
the
said
casual
visitor
not
even
pulwick
with
all
its
resources
where
housekeeping
between
the
fussy
brother
and
the
docile
sister
is
a
complicated
science
could
have
produced
more
real
comfort
in
the
morning
when
i
woke
late
it
was
broad
daylight
feeling
as
if
i
had
been
beaten
and
passed
through
a
mangle
for
there
was
not
an
inch
of
my
poor
body
that
was
not
sore
i
had
not
turned
round
and
so
given
sign
of
life
before
i
heard
a
whisper
outside
my
door
then
comes
a
sturdy
knock
and
in
walks
old
margery
still
dignified
as
a
queens
housekeeper
bearing
a
bowl
of
warm
frothy
milk
and
this
being
gratefully
drunk
by
me
she
gravely
inquires
in
her
queer
provincial
accent
how
i
am
this
morn
and
then
goes
to
report
to
some
anxious
inquirer
whomi
can
easily
guess
that
with
the
exception
of
my
cut
foot
i
am
very
well
presently
she
returns
and
lights
a
blazing
fire
then
in
come
my
dress
and
linen
and
my
one
shoe
all
cleaned
dried
and
mended
only
my
poor
habit
is
so
torn
and
so
stiff
that
i
have
to
put
up
with
margerys
best
striped
skirt
in
lieu
of
it
till
she
has
time
to
mend
and
wash
it
as
it
is
she
must
have
been
at
work
all
night
upon
these
repairs
for
me
again
she
goes
outfor
another
consultation
i
supposeand
comes
back
to
find
me
half
clad
hopping
about
the
room
this
time
she
has
got
nice
white
linen
bandages
and
with
them
ties
up
my
little
foot
partly
for
the
cuts
partly
for
want
of
a
sandal
till
it
is
twice
the
size
of
its
companion
but
i
can
walk
on
it
then
my
strange
handmaidwho
by
the
way
is
a
droll
grumbling
old
soul
and
orders
me
about
as
if
she
were
still
my
nursedresses
me
and
combs
my
hair
which
will
not
yet
awhile
be
rid
of
all
its
sand
and
so
in
due
course
molly
emerges
from
her
bower
as
well
tended
almost
as
she
might
have
been
at
bath
except
that
margerys
striped
skirt
is
a
deal
too
short
for
her
and
she
displays
a
little
more
of
one
very
nice
ankle
and
one
gouty
foot
than
fashion
warrants
and
in
this
manner
the
guest
goes
to
meet
her
host
in
the
great
room
he
was
walking
up
and
down
as
if
impatiently
expecting
me
and
when
i
hobbled
in
he
came
forward
with
a
smile
on
his
face
which
once
more
i
thought
beautiful
god
be
praised
he
said
taking
both
my
hands
and
kissing
one
of
them
with
his
fine
air
of
gallantry
which
was
all
the
more
delightful
on
account
of
his
evident
earnestness
you
seem
none
the
worse
for
this
terrible
adventure
i
dreaded
this
morning
to
hear
that
you
were
in
a
fever
you
know
he
added
so
seriously
that
i
had
to
smile
you
might
easily
have
had
a
fever
from
this
yesterdays
work
and
what
should
we
have
done
without
doctor
and
medicines
you
have
a
good
surgeon
at
least
said
i
laughing
and
pointing
at
my
swaddled
extremity
he
laughed
too
at
the
enmitouflage
i
tried
to
explain
how
it
was
to
be
done
he
said
but
i
think
i
could
have
managed
it
more
neatly
myself
then
he
helped
me
to
the
armchair
and
ren
came
in
and
after
a
profound
bow
which
did
not
preclude
much
staring
and
smiling
at
me
afterwards
laid
on
a
dazzling
tablecloth
a
most
tempting
breakfast
explaining
the
while
in
his
odd
english
the
bread
is
stale
for
we
bake
only
twice
a
month
but
there
are
some
cakes
hot
from
the
fire
some
eggs
new
laid
last
evening
some
fresh
milk
some
tea
it
was
a
happy
thing
i
arrived
yesterday
for
there
was
no
more
tea
the
butter
wants
but
mistress
margery
will
have
some
made
tomorrow
so
that
the
demoiselle
will
not
leave
without
having
tasted
our
scarthey
butter
all
the
while
sir
adrian
looked
on
with
a
sort
of
dreamy
smilea
happy
smile
poor
ren
he
said
when
the
man
had
left
the
room
one
would
think
that
you
have
brought
to
him
almost
as
much
joy
as
to
me
i
wondered
what
mr
landale
would
have
said
had
he
through
some
magic
glass
been
able
to
see
this
little
feast
i
never
enjoyed
a
meal
more
as
for
my
host
he
hardly
touched
anything
but
i
could
see
was
all
absorbed
in
the
delight
of
looking
at
me
and
this
he
showed
quite
openly
in
the
most
childlike
manner
not
one
of
the
many
fine
gentlemen
it
has
been
my
fate
to
meet
in
my
six
months
apprenticeship
to
the
great
world
not
cousin
rupert
himself
with
all
his
elaborate
politeness
and
rupert
has
de
grandes
manires
as
tanty
says
could
have
played
the
host
with
a
more
exquisite
courtesy
and
more
true
hospitality
so
i
thought
at
least
now
and
again
it
is
true
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
i
would
see
how
the
soul
behind
them
was
away
far
in
the
past
and
then
at
a
word
even
at
a
movement
back
it
would
come
to
me
with
the
tenderest
softening
i
have
ever
seen
upon
a
human
face





it
was
only
at
the
end
of
breakfast
that
he
suddenly
adverted
to
the
previous
day
of
course
he
said
hesitatingly
but
keeping
a
frank
gaze
on
mine
you
must
have
thought
me
demented
whenwhen
you
first
entered
yesterday
now
i
had
anticipated
this
apology
as
inevitable
and
i
was
prepared
to
put
him
at
his
ease
i
not
at
all
i
said
quite
gravely
and
seeing
the
puzzled
expression
that
came
upon
his
face
i
hastened
to
add
in
lower
tones
i
know
i
am
very
like
my
mother
and
it
was
her
name
you
called
out
upon
seeing
me
and
then
i
stopped
as
if
that
had
explained
everything
he
looked
at
me
with
a
wondering
air
and
fell
again
into
a
muse
after
a
while
he
said
with
his
great
simplicity
which
seems
somehow
in
him
the
last
touch
of
the
most
perfect
breeding
yes
such
an
apparition
was
enough
to
unhinge
any
ones
mind
for
the
moment
you
never
knew
her
child
and
therefore
never
mourned
her
death
but
wethat
is
ren
and
i
who
tried
so
hard
to
save
herthough
it
is
so
long
ago
we
have
not
forgotten
it
was
then
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
about
the
mother
i
had
never
known
at
first
it
was
as
if
he
could
not
he
fell
into
a
great
silence
through
which
i
could
feel
the
working
of
his
old
sorrow
so
then
i
said
to
him
quickly
for
i
feared
he
thought
me
an
indiscreet
trespasser
upon
sacred
ground
that
he
must
remember
my
right
to
know
more
than
the
vague
accounts
i
had
been
given
of
my
mothers
history
no
one
will
tell
me
of
her
i
said
it
is
hard
for
i
am
her
own
daughter
it
is
wrong
he
said
very
gently
you
ought
to
know
for
you
are
indeed
most
verily
her
own
daughter
and
then
by
fragments
he
tried
to
tell
me
a
little
of
her
beauty
her
loving
heart
her
faithfulness
and
bravery
at
first
it
was
with
great
tripping
sighs
as
if
the
words
hurt
him
but
by
and
by
it
came
easier
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
wistfully
on
me
he
took
me
as
it
were
by
his
side
through
all
their
marvellous
adventures
and
thus
i
heard
the
stirring
story
of
the
savenaye
band
and
i
felt
prouder
of
my
race
than
i
had
ever
been
before
hitherto
being
a
savenaye
only
meant
the
pride
our
aunt
tried
to
instil
into
us
of
being
undeniably
biennes
and
connected
with
numbers
of
great
families
but
the
tale
of
the
deeds
mine
had
done
for
the
kings
cause
and
especially
the
achievements
of
my
own
mother
in
starting
such
an
expedition
after
my
fathers
death
and
following
its
fortunes
to
the
bitter
end
made
my
blood
tingle
with
a
new
emotion
little
wonder
that
sir
adrian
should
have
devoted
his
life
to
her
service
how
madly
enthralled
i
should
have
been
being
a
man
and
free
and
strong
by
the
presence
of
a
woman
such
as
my
mother
i
too
would
have
prostrated
myself
to
worship
her
image
returning
to
lifeand
i
am
that
living
living
portrait
when
he
came
to
the
story
of
her
death
he
hesitated
and
finally
stopped
it
must
have
been
horrible
i
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
and
i
dared
not
press
him
now
i
suppose
i
am
the
only
one
in
the
world
besides
ren
who
knows
this
man
as
he
is
and
i
am
proud
of
it
and
it
is
for
this
constancy
which
no
vulgar
soul
of
them
can
understand
that
rupert
and
his
class
have
dubbed
the
gallant
gentleman
a
madman
it
fills
me
with
scorn
of
them
i
do
not
yet
know
what
love
is
therefore
of
course
i
cannot
fathom
its
grief
but
this
much
i
knowthat
if
i
loved
and
yet
could
not
reach
as
high
as
ever
love
may
reach
both
in
joy
and
sorrow
i
should
despise
myself
i
too
would
draw
the
utmost
from
life
that
life
can
give
he
never
even
hinted
at
his
love
for
my
mother
speaking
of
himself
throughout
as
ren
might
as
of
her
humble
devoted
servant
merely
and
then
the
question
began
to
gnaw
at
me
did
she
love
him
and
somehow
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
rest
till
i
knew
and
i
had
it
on
my
lips
twenty
times
to
cry
out
to
him
i
know
you
loved
her
oh
tell
me
did
she
love
you
and
yet
i
dared
no
more
have
done
so
and
overstepped
the
barrier
of
his
gentle
reticent
dignity
than
i
could
have
thrust
the
lighthouse
tower
down
and
i
could
not
think
either
whether
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
that
she
had
loved
him
or
that
she
had
not
not
even
here
alone
with
myself
can
i
answer
that
question
but
though
i
respect
him
because
he
is
as
i
have
found
him
and
understand
how
rare
a
personality
it
takes
to
achieve
such
refinement
of
faithfulness
it
seems
to
me
that
to
teach
this
constant
lover
to
forget
the
past
in
the
present
would
be
something
worth
living
forsomething
worthy
of
me
mollywhat
is
the
meaning
of
this
you
have
never
before
put
that
thought
in
words
even
to
yourself
but
let
me
be
frank
or
else
what
is
the
use
of
this
diary
looking
back
to
those
delightful
three
days
did
not
the
thought
come
to
me
if
not
the
words
well
well
it
is
better
sometimes
i
believe
to
let
oneself
drift
than
to
try
and
guide
the
boat
and
i
must
hurry
back
to
scarthey
or
i
shall
never
have
told
my
story
how
swiftly
time
had
flown
by
us
i
sitting
in
the
armchair
with
the
old
dogs
muzzle
on
my
lap
and
sir
adrian
standing
by
his
great
chimney
the
clock
struck
twelve
in
the
midst
of
the
long
silence
and
i
had
thought
that
barely
an
hour
had
passed
i
got
up
and
seeing
me
limp
in
my
attempt
to
walk
sir
adrian
gave
me
his
arm
and
so
we
went
round
the
great
room
bras
dessus
bras
dessous
and
it
already
seemed
quite
natural
to
feel
like
an
intimate
friend
in
that
queer
dwelling
we
paused
a
long
time
in
silence
by
the
window
the
tempest
wind
was
still
raging
but
the
sky
was
clear
and
all
round
us
was
a
wonderful
sight
the
sea
as
far
as
eyes
could
reach
white
with
foam
lashed
and
tossing
in
frenzy
round
the
rock
on
which
we
stood
so
safely
and
rising
in
long
jets
of
spray
which
now
and
then
dashed
as
far
as
our
window
and
when
i
looked
down
nearer
i
could
see
the
little
stunted
trees
bending
backwards
and
forwards
under
the
blast
and
an
odd
idea
came
to
my
mindthey
looked
to
me
when
they
caught
my
sight
as
though
they
were
bowing
deep
hurriedly
and
frantically
greeting
me
among
them
i
glanced
up
at
my
silent
companion
the
true
knight
and
found
his
wide
grey
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
the
same
expression
that
was
already
familiar
to
me
which
i
had
especially
noted
as
he
told
me
his
long
tale
of
olden
times
this
time
i
felt
the
look
go
to
my
heart
and
then
the
thought
first
came
to
my
mind
all
unformed
but
still
sweet
i
dont
know
exactly
why
but
in
answer
to
his
sad
look
i
smiled
at
him
without
a
word
upon
which
he
suddenly
grew
pale
after
a
while
he
gave
a
sigh
and
as
he
drew
my
arm
again
through
his
i
fancy
his
hand
trembled
a
little
when
he
had
taken
me
back
to
my
chair
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
silence
looking
at
me
ever
and
anon
a
long
time
we
passed
thus
without
speaking
but
it
seemed
as
if
our
thoughts
were
intermixing
in
harmony
in
the
midst
of
our
silence
and
then
the
spell
was
broken
by
ren
who
never
came
in
without
making
me
his
great
scrape
trying
hard
not
to
beam
too
obtrusively
in
the
delight
that
evidently
overtakes
him
whenever
he
sets
eyes
on
me
it
was
after
a
prolonged
talk
between
him
and
the
master
i
fancy
concerning
the
means
of
attending
fitly
upon
my
noble
and
delicate
person
that
sir
adrian
brought
back
evidently
to
the
consideration
of
present
affairs
began
to
be
exercised
about
the
best
means
of
whiling
away
my
time
when
he
hinted
at
the
difficulty
i
very
soon
disposed
of
it
i
told
him
i
had
never
been
so
happy
in
my
life
beforethat
the
hours
went
all
too
quicklyi
told
him
there
was
so
much
he
and
ren
had
yet
to
tell
me
of
their
wonderful
adventures
that
i
thought
i
should
have
to
carry
them
back
to
pulwick
with
me
at
the
mention
of
pulwick
his
brow
darkened
and
ren
turned
away
to
cough
into
his
hand
and
i
saw
that
i
had
gone
too
fast
nbpulwick
is
evidently
a
sore
subject
i
am
sure
i
am
not
surprised
i
can
conceive
how
rupert
and
sophia
would
drive
a
man
of
sir
adrians
sensitiveness
nearly
to
desperation
yet
i
have
brought
sir
adrian
back
to
pulwick
in
spite
of
all
is
not
that
a
feather
in
my
cap
but
to
return
i
next
made
ren
laugh
aloud
and
sir
adrian
give
his
indulgent
smilesuch
as
a
father
might
give
to
his
childby
adding
that
when
i
was
bored
i
would
soon
let
them
know
i
always
do
i
said
for
i
consider
that
a
duty
to
myself
god
knows
said
this
strange
man
then
half
smiling
i
would
we
could
keep
you
here
for
ever
it
was
almost
a
declaration
but
his
eyes
were
far
offit
was
not
addressed
to
me
i
soon
found
that
the
recollection
of
all
the
extraordinary
incidents
sir
adrian
had
lived
through
is
one
neither
of
pride
nor
pleasure
to
him
but
all
the
same
never
has
anything
in
books
seemed
to
me
so
stirring
as
the
tale
of
relentless
fate
of
everrecurring
battles
and
struggles
and
misfortunes
told
by
the
man
who
still
in
the
strength
of
life
has
now
chosen
to
forego
everything
that
might
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
have
compensated
him
willing
as
he
was
to
humour
me
however
and
disproportionately
anxious
to
amuse
me
it
was
little
more
than
the
dry
bones
of
his
history
i
was
able
to
obtain
from
him
with
rens
help
however
and
my
own
lively
imagination
i
have
been
able
to
piece
together
a
very
wonderful
skeleton
from
these
same
dry
bones
and
moreover
endow
it
with
flesh
and
blood
and
life
ren
was
very
willing
to
descant
upon
his
masters
exploits
as
far
as
he
knew
them
whew
mademoiselle
should
have
seen
him
fight
he
would
say
a
lion
mademoiselle
a
real
lion
and
then
i
would
contrast
the
reposeful
somewhat
immobile
countenance
the
dreaming
eye
the
almost
womanly
softness
of
his
smile
with
the
picture
and
find
the
contrast
piquant
in
the
extreme
concerning
his
present
home
sir
adrian
was
more
willing
to
speaki
had
told
him
how
the
light
on
the
little
island
had
fascinated
me
from
the
distance
and
all
the
surmises
i
had
made
about
it
and
so
it
was
in
order
to
see
what
sort
of
dungeon
they
kept
the
madman
in
he
said
laughing
quietly
that
you
pushed
the
reconnaissance
which
nearly
sent
you
into
the
jaws
of
death
i
was
so
struck
at
first
by
his
speaking
of
himself
as
the
reputed
madman
that
i
could
not
answer
to
think
of
him
as
serenely
contemptuous
of
the
worlds
imputationand
an
imputation
so
galling
as
this
one
of
being
irresponsible
for
his
actionsand
deliberately
continuing
his
even
way
without
taking
the
trouble
to
refute
it
has
given
me
an
insight
into
his
nature
that
fills
me
with
admiration
and
yet
at
the
same
time
with
a
sort
of
longing
to
see
him
reinstated
in
his
proper
place
and
casting
out
those
slandering
interlopers
but
as
he
was
waiting
to
be
answered
i
had
to
collect
my
thoughts
and
admit
not
without
a
little
bashfulness
that
my
first
account
of
my
exploit
had
contained
a
slight
prevarication
in
all
he
has
to
say
about
his
little
scarthey
domain
about
the
existence
he
has
made
for
himself
there
i
cannot
help
noticing
with
what
affection
he
speaks
of
ren
ren
according
to
sir
adrian
is
everything
and
everywhere
a
perfect
familiar
genius
he
is
counsellor
as
well
as
valet
plays
his
masters
game
of
chess
as
well
as
shaves
him
can
tune
his
organ
and
manage
his
boat
and
cast
his
nets
for
he
is
fisherman
as
well
as
gardener
he
is
the
steward
of
this
wonderful
little
estate
and
its
stock
of
one
pony
one
cow
and
twelve
hens
he
tends
the
light
and
can
cook
a
dinner
a
great
deal
better
than
his
great
rival
old
margery
of
this
last
accomplishment
we
had
good
proof
in
the
shape
of
various
dainties
that
appeared
at
our
dinner
for
when
i
exclaimed
in
astonishment
the
master
said
well
pleased
and
pointing
to
the
attentive
majordomo
this
is
rens
way
of
spoiling
me
but
now
he
has
surpassed
himself
to
celebrate
so
unique
an
occasion
and
rens
face
was
all
one
grin
of
rapture
i
observe
that
on
occasions
his
eyes
wander
quite
tenderly
from
me
to
his
master
shall
i
ever
enjoy
dinners
again
like
those
in
that
old
ruined
tower
or
hours
like
those
during
which
i
listened
to
tales
of
peril
and
adventure
or
to
the
music
that
pealed
forth
from
the
distant
corner
when
sir
adrian
sat
down
to
his
organ
and
made
it
speak
the
wordless
language
of
the
soul
that
language
that
made
me
at
times
shiver
with
a
mad
yearning
for
life
more
life
at
times
soothed
my
heart
with
a
caress
of
infinite
softness
how
is
it
that
our
organsongs
at
the
convent
never
moved
me
in
this
fashion
ah
those
will
be
days
to
remember
all
the
more
for
being
certain
that
they
will
not
be
forgotten
by
him
yes
those
days
have
brought
some
light
into
his
melancholy
life
even
ren
knows
that
oh
my
lady
said
he
to
me
as
he
was
leaving
the
island
yesterday
you
have
come
like
the
good
fairy
you
have
brought
back
the
joy
of
life
to
his
honour
i
have
not
heard
him
really
laughbefore
this
year
passed
i
did
not
believe
he
knew
any
more
how
to
laughwhat
you
can
call
laugh
it
is
quite
true
i
had
made
some
droll
remark
about
tanty
and
cousin
sophia
and
when
he
laughed
he
looked
like
a
young
man
he
was
quick
enough
in
grasping
at
a
pretext
for
keeping
me
yet
another
day
yesterday
the
wind
having
suddenly
abated
in
the
night
there
was
quite
a
bevy
of
little
fishingboats
sailing
merrily
away
and
the
causeway
at
low
water
was
quite
visible
as
we
looked
out
i
know
the
same
idea
came
to
both
our
minds
though
there
was
no
word
between
us
at
last
it
was
i
who
spoke
the
crossing
is
quite
safe
said
i
and
i
added
as
he
answered
nothing
i
almost
wish
now
it
was
not
how
quick
the
time
has
gone
by
here
his
countenance
when
i
looked
up
was
darker
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
in
the
distance
at
last
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
i
suppose
it
is
high
time
you
should
go
back
i
am
sure
i
dont
wish
it
i
said
quite
franklyhe
is
not
the
sort
of
man
with
whom
one
would
ever
think
of
minauderie
but
madeleine
will
be
miserable
about
me
and
so
you
would
really
care
to
stop
here
said
he
with
a
smile
of
wonder
on
his
face
if
it
were
not
for
that
reason
naturally
i
would
said
i
i
feel
already
as
cosy
as
a
tame
cat
here
and
if
it
were
not
for
madeleine
poor
little
madeleine
who
must
be
breaking
her
heartbut
then
how
can
i
go
backi
have
no
wraps
and
only
one
shoe
his
face
had
cleared
again
he
was
walking
up
and
down
in
his
usual
way
whilst
i
hopped
back
with
more
limping
than
was
at
all
necessary
to
my
favourite
armchair
true
true
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
you
cannot
walk
with
one
shoe
and
a
bandaged
foot
and
your
clothes
are
too
thin
for
the
roundabout
sea
journey
in
this
cold
wind
this
is
what
we
shall
do
child
he
went
on
coming
up
to
me
with
a
sage
expression
that
struggled
with
his
evident
eager
desire
ren
shall
go
off
as
soon
as
the
tide
permits
carrying
the
good
news
of
your
safety
to
your
sister
and
bring
back
some
warm
things
for
you
to
wear
tomorrow
morning
and
i
shall
write
to
rupert
to
send
a
carriage
to
wait
for
you
on
the
strand
and
so
pleased
like
two
children
who
have
found
a
means
of
securing
a
further
holiday
we
wrote
both
our
letters
i
wonder
whether
it
occurred
to
sir
adrian
as
it
did
to
me
that
if
we
had
been
so
very
anxious
that
i
should
be
restored
to
the
care
of
pulwick
with
the
briefest
delay
i
might
have
gone
with
ren
that
same
day
wrapped
up
in
a
certain
cloak
which
had
done
good
warming
service
already
and
that
as
ren
had
constructed
with
his
cunning
hands
a
sufficient
if
not
very
pretty
sandal
for
my
damaged
foot
out
of
some
old
piece
of
felt
i
might
have
walked
from
the
beach
to
the
fishing
village
and
that
there
no
doubt
a
cart
or
a
donkey
might
have
conveyed
me
home
in
triumph
perhaps
it
did
not
occur
to
him
and
certainly
i
had
no
desire
to
suggest
it
on
my
side
thus
soon
after
midday
master
ren
departed
alone
and
sir
adrian
and
i
both
very
glad
of
our
reprieve
watched
leaning
side
by
side
upon
the
windowsill
the
brave
little
craft
glide
away
on
the
still
ruffled
waters
until
when
it
had
grown
very
small
in
the
distance
we
saw
the
sail
lowered
and
knew
ren
had
reached
mainland
and
that
was
perhaps
the
best
day
of
the
three
ren
having
been
unexpectedly
despatched
we
had
to
help
to
do
everything
ourselves
with
old
margery
who
is
rather
feeble
the
sky
was
clear
and
beautiful
and
followed
gravely
by
jem
the
dog
we
went
round
the
little
outer
domain
i
fed
the
hens
and
sir
adrian
carried
the
pail
when
margery
had
milked
the
cow
we
paid
a
visit
in
his
wide
paddock
to
the
pony
who
trotted
up
to
his
master
whinnying
with
pleasure
we
looked
at
the
waters
rushing
past
like
a
mill
race
on
the
further
side
of
the
island
as
the
tide
was
rising
and
he
explained
to
me
that
it
was
this
rush
which
makes
the
neighbourhood
of
scarthey
so
dangerous
to
unwary
crafts
we
went
down
into
the
seacaves
which
penetrate
deep
under
the
ruinsthey
say
that
in
olden
days
there
was
a
passage
under
the
rocky
causeway
that
led
as
far
as
the
old
priory
but
all
traces
of
it
have
been
effaced
then
later
on
sir
adrian
showed
me
in
detail
his
library
i
was
made
to
be
a
man
of
books
he
said
when
i
wondered
at
the
number
he
had
accumulated
around
himthere
must
be
thousands
a
man
of
study
not
of
action
and
you
know
how
fate
has
treated
me
these
have
been
my
one
consolation
of
late
years
and
it
marvelled
me
to
think
that
one
who
had
achieved
so
many
manly
deeds
should
love
musty
old
tiresome
things
so
much
he
really
turned
them
over
quite
reverentially
i
myself
do
not
think
much
of
books
as
companions
when
i
made
that
little
confession
he
smiled
rather
sadly
and
said
that
one
like
me
never
would
lack
the
suitable
companions
of
youth
and
happiness
but
that
a
creature
of
his
unfortunate
disposition
could
find
in
these
long
rows
of
folded
leaves
the
society
of
the
best
and
the
loftiest
minds
not
of
our
age
but
of
all
ages
and
what
was
more
could
find
them
ready
for
intercourse
and
at
their
best
humour
just
in
those
hours
when
he
himself
was
fit
and
disposed
for
such
intercourseand
this
without
dread
of
inflicting
his
own
misery
and
dulness
upon
them
but
i
could
not
agree
with
his
appreciation
i
felt
my
nose
curl
with
disdain
at
the
breath
of
dust
and
must
and
age
these
old
tomes
gave
forth
and
i
said
again
it
was
to
my
mind
but
a
poor
and
tame
sort
of
fellowship
he
was
perched
on
his
ladder
and
had
some
odd
volume
in
his
hand
from
which
he
was
about
to
give
an
example
in
point
on
hearing
however
this
uncongenial
sentiment
he
pushed
back
the
book
and
came
down
quickly
enough
to
talk
to
me
and
this
was
the
last
of
our
excursions
among
the
bookshelves
of
this
i
was
glad
for
i
confess
it
was
there
i
liked
sir
adrian
the
least
when
the
end
of
the
short
day
drew
near
it
was
time
to
go
and
attend
to
the
beacon
we
ascended
the
ladderlike
wooden
stairs
leading
to
the
platform
then
i
had
the
reverse
of
that
view
that
for
so
many
days
had
engrossed
my
interest
pulwick
from
scarthey
what
a
long
time
it
seemed
then
since
i
had
left
those
rooms
the
windows
of
which
now
sent
us
back
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
and
i
had
no
desire
to
return
though
return
i
must
on
the
morrow
ren
of
course
had
left
everything
in
his
usual
trim
order
so
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
see
to
the
lamp
it
pleased
my
fantasy
to
light
the
beacon
of
scarthey
myself
and
i
struck
the
steel
and
kindled
the
brimstone
and
set
fire
to
the
huge
illsmelling
wicks
until
they
gave
a
flame
as
big
as
my
hand
and
there
is
the
light
of
scarthey
at
close
quarters
i
thought
and
the
lightkeeper
was
bending
over
me
with
his
kindly
look
humouring
me
like
a
child
as
we
sat
there
silently
for
a
while
in
the
twilight
there
came
from
the
little
room
adjoining
the
turret
an
odd
sound
of
flapping
and
uncanny
melancholy
cries
sir
adrian
rose
and
we
remembered
the
seagull
by
which
he
had
played
the
part
of
good
samaritan
it
had
happened
on
the
second
day
as
the
storm
was
at
its
height
there
had
come
a
great
crash
at
the
window
and
we
saw
something
white
that
struggled
on
the
sill
outside
sir
adrian
opened
the
casement
when
we
had
a
little
tornado
of
our
own
inside
and
all
his
papers
began
dancing
a
sarabande
in
the
room
and
we
gathered
in
the
poor
creature
that
was
hurt
and
battered
and
more
than
half
stunned
opening
alternately
its
yellow
bill
and
its
red
eyes
in
the
most
absurd
manner
with
a
solicitude
that
it
amused
me
to
watch
sir
adrian
had
tended
the
helpless
gooselike
thing
and
then
handed
it
to
rens
further
care
ren
it
seemed
had
thought
of
trying
to
tame
the
wild
bird
and
had
constructed
a
huge
sort
of
cage
with
laths
and
barrelhoops
and
installed
it
there
with
various
nasty
seafishy
weedy
things
such
as
seagulls
consider
dainty
but
the
prisoner
now
its
vigour
had
returned
yearned
for
nothing
but
the
free
air
and
ever
and
anon
almost
broke
its
wings
in
sudden
frenzy
to
escape
i
wonder
at
ren
said
sir
adrian
contemplating
the
animal
with
his
grave
look
of
commiseration
ren
who
like
myself
has
been
a
prisoner
he
will
be
disappointed
but
we
shall
make
one
of
gods
creatures
happy
this
day
there
is
not
overmuch
happiness
in
this
world
and
regardless
of
the
vicious
pecks
aimed
at
his
hands
he
with
firmness
folded
the
great
strong
wings
and
legs
and
carried
the
gull
outside
on
the
parapet
there
the
bird
sat
a
moment
astonished
turning
its
head
round
at
its
benefactor
before
taking
wing
and
then
it
rose
flying
away
in
great
swoopsflap
flapacross
the
waves
till
we
could
see
it
no
longer
ugly
and
awkward
as
the
creature
looked
in
its
cage
it
was
beautiful
in
its
joyful
steady
flight
and
i
was
glad
to
see
it
go
i
must
have
been
a
bird
myself
in
another
existence
for
i
have
often
that
longing
to
fly
upon
me
and
it
makes
my
heart
swell
with
a
great
impatience
that
i
cannot
but
i
could
not
help
remarking
to
sir
adrian
that
the
birds
last
look
round
had
been
full
of
anger
rather
than
gratitude
and
his
answer
as
he
watched
it
sweep
heavily
away
was
too
gloomy
to
please
me
gratitude
said
he
is
as
rare
as
unselfishness
if
it
were
not
so
this
world
would
be
different
indeed
as
it
is
we
have
no
more
right
to
expect
the
one
than
the
other
and
when
all
is
said
and
done
if
doing
a
socalled
kind
action
gives
us
pleasure
it
is
only
a
special
form
of
selfindulgence
there
is
something
wrong
about
a
reasoning
of
this
kind
but
i
could
not
exactly
point
out
where
we
both
stood
gazing
out
from
our
platform
upon
the
darkening
waters
then
across
our
vision
there
crept
round
the
promontory
a
beautiful
ship
with
all
sails
set
looking
like
some
gigantic
white
bird
sailing
sailing
so
swiftly
yet
so
surely
by
through
the
dim
light
and
i
cried
out
in
admiration
for
there
is
something
in
the
sight
of
a
ship
silently
gliding
that
always
sets
my
heart
beating
but
sir
adrians
face
grew
stern
and
he
said
a
ship
is
a
whitened
sepulchre
but
for
all
that
he
looked
at
it
long
and
pensively
now
it
had
struck
me
before
this
that
sir
adrian
with
all
his
kindness
of
heart
takes
but
a
dismal
view
of
human
nature
and
human
destiny
that
to
him
what
spoils
the
face
of
this
world
is
that
strife
of
lifewhich
to
me
is
as
the
breath
of
my
nostrils
the
absence
of
which
made
my
convent
days
so
grey
and
hateful
to
look
back
upon
i
did
not
like
to
feel
out
of
harmony
with
him
and
so
almost
angrily
i
reproached
him
would
you
have
every
one
live
like
a
limpet
on
a
rock
cried
i
great
heavens
i
would
rather
be
dead
than
not
be
up
and
doing
he
looked
at
me
gravely
pityingly
may
you
never
see
what
i
have
seen
said
he
may
you
never
learn
what
men
have
made
of
the
world
god
keep
your
fair
life
from
such
ways
as
mine
has
been
made
to
follow
the
words
filled
me
i
dont
know
why
with
sudden
misgiving
is
this
life
i
am
so
eager
for
but
horror
and
misery
after
all
would
it
be
better
to
leave
the
book
unopened
they
said
so
at
the
convent
but
what
can
they
know
of
life
at
a
convent
he
bent
his
kind
face
towards
mine
in
the
thickening
gloom
as
though
to
read
my
thoughts
and
his
lips
moved
but
he
did
not
speak
aloud
then
above
the
song
of
the
waves
as
they
gathered
rolled
in
and
fell
upon
the
shingle
all
around
there
came
the
beat
of
oars
hark
said
sir
adrian
our
good
ren
his
tone
was
cheerful
again
and
as
he
hurried
me
away
down
the
stairs
i
knew
he
was
glad
to
divert
me
from
the
melancholy
into
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
drift
and
then
good
ren
came
bringing
breezy
life
and
cheerfulness
with
him
and
a
bundle
and
a
letter
for
me
poor
madeleine
it
seems
she
has
been
quite
ill
with
weeping
for
molly
and
indeed
her
dear
scrawl
was
so
illegible
that
i
could
hardly
read
it
ren
says
she
was
nearly
as
much
upset
by
the
joy
as
by
the
grief
mr
landale
was
not
at
home
he
had
ridden
to
meet
tanty
at
liverpool
for
the
dear
old
lady
has
been
summoned
back
in
hot
haste
with
the
news
of
my
decease
he
for
one
i
thought
to
myself
will
survive
the
shock
of
relief
at
learning
that
molly
has
risen
from
the
dead





ting
ting
ting
there
goes
my
little
clock
fussily
counting
the
hour
to
tell
me
that
i
have
written
so
long
a
time
that
i
ought
to
be
tired
and
so
i
am
though
i
have
not
told
you
half
of
all
i
meant
to
tell
chapter
xvi
the
recluse
and
the
squire
i
thought
i
should
never
get
away
from
supper
and
be
alone
ruperts
air
of
cool
triumphit
was
triumph
however
he
may
have
wished
to
hide
itand
tantys
flow
of
indignation
recrimination
speculation
and
amazement
were
enough
to
drive
me
mad
but
i
held
out
i
pretended
i
did
not
mind
my
cheeks
were
blazing
and
i
talked

tort
et

travers
i
should
have
died
rather
than
that
rupert
should
have
guessed
at
the
tempest
in
my
heart
now
i
am
alone
at
last
thank
god
and
it
will
be
a
relief
to
confide
to
my
faithful
diary
the
feelings
that
have
been
choking
me
these
last
two
hours
pride
must
have
a
fall
thus
rupert
at
supper
with
reference
it
is
true
to
some
trivial
incident
but
looking
at
me
hard
and
full
and
pointing
the
words
with
his
meaning
smile
the
fairies
who
attended
at
my
birth
endowed
me
with
one
power
which
however
doubtful
a
blessing
it
may
prove
in
the
long
run
has
nevertheless
been
an
unspeakable
comfort
to
me
hitherto
this
is
the
reverse
of
what
i
heard
a
french
gentleman
term
lesprit
de
lescalier
thanks
to
this
fairy
godmother
of
mine
the
instant
some
one
annoys
or
angers
me
there
rises
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
the
most
galling
rejoinder
that
can
possibly
be
made
in
the
circumstances
and
i
need
not
add
i
make
it
tonight
when
rupert
flung
his
scoff
at
me
i
was
ready
for
him
i
trust
the
old
adage
has
not
been
brought
home
to
you
sir
rupert
said
i
and
then
pretending
confusion
i
beg
your
pardon
i
added
i
have
been
so
accustomed
to
address
the
head
of
the
house
these
last
days
that
the
word
escaped
me
unawares
the
shot
told
well
and
i
was
gladglad
of
the
murderous
rage
in
ruperts
eyes
for
i
knew
i
had
hit
him
on
the
raw
even
tanty
looked
perturbed
but
rupert
let
me
alone
for
the
rest
of
supper
he
is
right
nevertheless
that
is
what
stung
me
i
am
humbled
and
i
cannot
bear
it
sir
adrian
has
left
i
was
so
triumphant
to
bring
him
back
to
pulwick
this
morning
to
have
circumvented
ruperts
plans
and
let
me
speak
the
truth
so
happy
to
have
him
with
me
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
my
exultation
and
now
he
has
gone
gone
without
a
word
to
me
only
this
miserable
letter
of
determined
farewell
i
will
copy
itfor
in
my
first
anger
i
have
so
crumpled
the
paper
that
it
is
scarcely
readable
my
child
i
must
go
back
to
my
island
the
world
is
not
for
me
nor
am
i
for
the
world
nor
would
i
cast
the
shadow
of
my
gloomy
life
further
upon
your
bright
one
let
me
tell
you
however
that
you
have
left
me
the
better
for
your
coming
that
it
will
be
a
good
thought
to
me
in
my
loneliness
to
know
of
your
mothers
daughters
so
close
to
me
when
you
look
across
at
the
beacon
of
scarthey
child
through
the
darkness
think
that
though
i
may
not
see
you
again
i
shall
ever
follow
and
keep
guard
upon
your
life
and
upon
your
sisters
and
that
even
when
you
are
far
from
pulwick
the
light
will
burn
and
the
heart
of
adrian
landale
watch
so
long
as
it
may
beat
i
have
shed
more
tearshot
tears
of
angersince
i
received
this
than
i
have
wept
in
all
my
life
before
madeleine
came
in
to
me
just
now
too
full
of
the
happiness
of
having
me
back
poor
darling
to
be
able
to
bear
me
out
of
sight
again
but
i
have
driven
her
from
me
with
such
cross
words
that
she
too
is
in
tears
i
must
be
alone
and
i
must
collect
myself
and
my
thoughts
for
i
want
to
state
exactly
all
that
has
happened
and
then
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
see
my
way
more
clearly





this
morning
then
early
after
breakfast
i
started
across
the
waters
between
ren
and
sir
adrian
regretting
to
leave
the
dear
hospitable
island
yet
with
my
heart
dancing
within
me
as
gaily
as
did
our
little
boat
upon
the
chopping
waves
to
be
carrying
the
hermit
back
with
me
i
had
been
deadly
afraid
lest
he
should
at
the
last
moment
have
sent
me
alone
with
the
servant
but
when
he
put
on
his
big
cloak
when
i
saw
ren
place
a
bag
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
knew
he
meant
to
comeperhaps
remain
some
days
at
pulwick
and
my
spirits
went
up
up
it
was
a
lovely
day
too
the
air
had
a
crisp
cold
sparkle
and
the
waters
looked
so
blue
under
the
clear
frosty
sky
i
could
have
sung
as
we
rowed
along
and
every
time
i
met
sir
adrians
eye
i
smiled
at
him
out
of
the
happiness
of
my
heart
his
look
hung
on
mewe
french
have
a
word
for
that
which
is
not
translatable
il
me
couvait
des
yeuxand
as
every
day
of
the
three
we
had
spent
together
i
had
thought
him
younger
and
handsomer
so
this
morning
out
in
the
bright
sunlight
i
said
to
myself
i
could
never
wish
to
see
a
more
noble
man
when
we
landedand
it
was
but
a
little
way
for
the
tide
was
lowthere
was
the
carriage
waiting
and
ren
all
grins
handed
over
our
parcels
to
the
footman
then
we
got
in
the
wheels
began
slowly
dragging
across
the
sand
to
the
road
the
poor
horses
pulling
and
straining
for
it
was
heavy
work
and
ren
stood
watching
us
by
his
boat
his
hand
over
his
eyes
a
black
figure
against
the
dazzling
sunshine
on
the
bay
but
i
could
see
his
white
teeth
gleam
in
that
broad
smile
of
his
from
out
of
his
shadowy
face
as
at
length
we
reached
the
high
road
and
bowled
swiftly
along
i
would
not
let
sir
adrian
have
peace
to
think
for
something
at
my
heart
told
me
he
hated
the
going
back
to
pulwick
and
i
so
chattered
and
fixed
his
attention
that
as
the
carriage
drew
up
he
was
actually
laughing
when
we
stopped
another
carriage
in
front
moved
off
and
there
on
the
porch
stoodrupert
and
tanty
poor
tanty
her
old
face
all
disfigured
with
tears
and
a
great
black
bonnet
and
veil
towering
on
her
head
i
popped
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
called
to
them
when
they
caught
sight
of
me
both
seemed
to
grow
rigid
with
amazement
and
then
across
ruperts
face
came
such
a
look
of
fury
and
such
a
deathly
pallor
i
had
thought
certainly
he
would
not
weep
the
eyes
out
of
his
head
for
me
but
that
he
should
be
stricken
with
anger
to
see
me
alive
i
had
hardly
expected
and
for
the
instant
it
frightened
me
but
then
i
had
no
time
to
observe
anything
else
for
tanty
collapsed
upon
the
steps
and
went
off
into
as
fine
a
fit
of
hysterics
as
i
have
ever
seen
but
fortunately
it
did
not
last
long
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
her
screams
and
rockings
to
and
fro
she
perceived
sir
adrian
as
he
leant
anxiously
over
her
with
the
utmost
energy
she
clutched
his
arm
and
scrambled
to
her
feet
is
it
you
me
poor
child
she
cried
is
it
you
and
then
she
turned
from
him
as
he
stood
with
his
gentle
earnest
face
looking
down
upon
her
and
gave
rupert
a
glare
that
might
have
slain
him
i
knew
at
once
what
she
was
thinking
i
had
experienced
myself
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
sir
adrian
and
connect
his
dignified
presence
for
one
second
with
the
scandalous
impression
rupert
would
have
conveyed
as
for
rupert
he
looked
for
the
first
time
since
i
knew
him
thoroughly
unnerved
then
tanty
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
shook
me
how
dare
you
miss
how
dare
you
she
cried
her
face
was
flaming
how
dare
i
what
asked
i
as
i
hugged
her
how
dare
you
be
walking
about
when
it
is
dead
you
are
and
give
us
all
such
a
frighttherethere
you
know
what
i
meanadrian
she
whimpered
give
me
your
arm
my
nephew
and
conduct
me
into
your
house
all
this
has
upset
me
very
much
but
oh
am
i
not
glad
to
see
you
both
my
children
in
they
went
together
and
my
courage
having
risen
again
to
its
usual
height
i
waited
purposely
on
the
porch
to
tease
rupert
a
little
i
had
a
real
pleasure
in
noticing
how
he
trembled
with
agitation
beneath
his
mask
well
are
you
glad
to
see
me
cousin
rupert
said
i
he
took
my
hand
his
fingers
were
damp
and
cold
can
you
ask
my
fair
cousin
he
sneered
do
you
not
see
me
overcome
with
joy
am
i
not
indeed
especially
favoured
by
providence
for
is
not
this
the
second
time
that
a
beloved
being
has
been
restored
into
my
arms
like
lazarus
from
the
grave
i
was
indignant
at
the
heartlessness
of
his
cynicism
and
so
the
answer
that
leaped
to
my
lips
was
out
before
i
had
time
to
reflect
upon
its
unladylikeness
ay
said
i
and
each
time
you
have
cried
in
your
soul
like
martha
behold
he
stinketh
my
cousin
laughed
aloud
you
have
a
sharp
tongue
he
said
take
care
you
are
not
cut
with
it
yourself
some
day
just
then
the
footmen
who
had
been
unpacking
tantys
trunks
from
the
first
carriage
laid
a
great
wooden
box
upon
the
porch
and
one
of
them
asked
rupert
which
room
they
should
bring
it
to
rupert
looked
at
it
strangely
and
then
at
me
take
it
where
you
will
he
exclaimed
at
last
there
lies
good
moneyvalue
wastedthough
after
all
one
never
knows
what
is
it
said
i
struck
by
a
sinister
meaning
in
his
accents
mourning
beautiful
mollymourning
for
youcrapegownsweeperswherewith
to
have
dried
your
sisters
tearsbut
not
needed
yet
you
see
he
bared
his
teeth
at
me
over
his
shoulderi
could
not
call
it
a
smileand
then
paused
as
he
was
about
to
brush
past
into
the
hall
to
give
me
the
pas
with
a
mocking
bow
he
does
not
even
attempt
now
to
hide
his
dislike
of
me
nor
to
draw
for
me
that
cloak
of
suave
composure
over
the
fierce
temper
that
is
always
gnawing
at
his
vitals
as
surely
as
fox
ever
gnawed
little
spartan
he
sees
that
it
is
useless
i
suppose
as
i
went
upstairs
to
greet
madeleine
i
laughed
to
myself
to
think
how
fate
had
circumvented
the
plotter
alas
how
foolish
i
was
to
laugh
rupert
is
a
dangerous
enemy
and
i
have
made
him
mine
and
in
a
few
hours
he
has
shuffled
the
cards
and
now
he
holds
the
trumps
again
for
that
there
is
du
rupert
in
this
sudden
departure
of
my
knight
i
am
convinced
of
course
his
reasons
are
plain
to
see
it
is
the
vulgarest
ambition
that
prompts
him
to
oust
his
brother
for
as
long
as
possiblefor
ever
if
he
can
and
now
i
am
outwitted
je
rage
i
have
never
been
so
unhappy
my
heart
feels
all
crushed
i
see
no
help
anywhere
i
cannot
in
common
decency
go
and
seek
sir
adrian
upon
his
island
again
and
so
i
sit
and
cry





immediately
upon
his
arrival
tanty
was
closeted
with
sir
adrian
in
the
chamber
allotted
to
her
for
so
long
a
space
of
time
that
rupert
watching
below
in
an
inward
fever
now
flung
back
in
his
chair
biting
his
nails
now
restlessly
pacing
the
room
from
end
to
end
his
mind
working
on
the
new
problem
his
ears
strained
to
catch
the
least
sound
the
while
was
fain
at
last
to
ring
and
give
orders
for
the
immediate
sounding
of
the
dinner
bell
a
good
hour
before
that
meal
might
be
expected
as
the
only
chance
of
interrupting
a
conference
which
boded
so
ill
to
his
plans
meanwhile
madeleine
sobbed
out
the
story
of
her
grief
and
joy
on
mollys
heart
and
miss
sophia
who
thus
inconsiderately
arrested
in
the
full
congenial
flow
of
a
new
grief
was
thrown
back
upon
her
old
sorrows
for
consolation
had
felt
impelled
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
rectors
grave
with
the
wateringcan
and
an
extra
pockethandkerchief
never
perhaps
since
that
worthy
clergyman
had
gasped
out
his
last
struggling
breath
upon
her
bosom
had
she
known
more
unmixed
satisfaction
than
during
those
days
when
she
hovered
round
poor
prostrate
madeleines
bed
and
poured
into
her
deaf
ear
the
tale
of
her
own
woes
and
the
assurances
of
her
thoroughly
understanding
sympathy
she
had
been
looking
forward
with
a
chastened
eagerness
to
the
arrival
of
the
mourning
and
had
already
derived
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
from
the
donning
of
certain
aged
weeds
treasured
in
her
wardrobe
it
was
therefore
a
distinct
though
quite
unconscious
disappointment
when
the
news
came
which
put
an
untimely
end
to
all
these
funereal
revels
at
the
shrill
clamour
of
the
bell
as
rupert
anticipated
adrian
emerged
instantly
from
his
aunts
room
and
a
simultaneous
jingle
of
minor
bells
announced
that
the
ladies
attention
was
in
all
haste
being
turned
to
toilet
matters
whatever
had
passed
between
his
good
old
relative
and
his
sensitive
brother
ruperts
quick
appraising
glance
at
the
latters
face
as
he
went
slowly
down
the
corridor
to
his
own
specially
reserved
apartment
was
sufficient
to
confirm
the
watcher
in
his
misgiving
that
matters
were
not
progressing
as
he
might
wish
sir
adrian
seemed
absorbed
it
is
true
in
grave
thought
but
his
countenance
was
neither
distressed
nor
gloomy
with
a
spasm
of
fierce
annoyance
and
a
bitter
curse
on
the
meddling
of
old
females
and
young
rupert
had
to
admit
that
never
had
he
seen
his
brother
look
more
handsome
more
master
of
the
house
and
of
himself
more
sane
a
few
minutes
later
the
guests
of
pulwick
assembled
in
the
library
one
by
one
with
the
exception
of
sophia
still
watering
the
last
restingplace
of
the
rev
herbert
lee
adrian
came
first
closely
followed
by
tanty
who
turned
a
marked
shoulder
upon
her
younger
nephew
and
devoted
all
her
attention
to
the
elderin
which
strained
condition
of
affairs
the
conversation
between
the
three
was
not
likely
to
be
lively
next
the
sisters
attired
alike
in
white
entered
together
bringing
a
bright
vision
of
youth
and
loveliness
into
the
old
room
at
sight
of
them
adrian
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
sudden
sharp
ejaculation
upon
which
the
two
girls
halted
on
the
threshold
half
shy
half
smiling
for
the
moment
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
they
were
surprisingly
like
each
other
the
difference
of
colouring
being
lost
in
their
curious
similarity
of
contour
my
god
were
there
then
two
cciles
beautiful
miraculous
consoling
had
been
to
the
mourner
in
his
loneliness
the
apparition
of
his
dead
love
restored
to
life
every
time
his
eyes
had
fallen
upon
molly
during
these
last
few
blessed
days
but
this
new
development
was
only
like
a
troublous
mocking
dream
tanty
turned
in
startled
amazement
she
could
feel
the
shudder
that
shook
his
frame
through
the
hand
with
which
he
still
unconsciously
grasped
at
the
back
of
her
chair
an
irrepressible
smile
crept
to
ruperts
lips
the
little
interlude
could
not
have
lasted
more
than
a
few
seconds
when
molly
recovering
her
usual
selfpossession
came
boldly
forward
leading
her
sister
by
the
tips
of
her
fingers
cousin
adrian
she
said
my
sister
madeleine
has
many
things
to
say
to
you
in
thanks
for
your
care
of
my
valuable
person
but
just
now
she
is
too
bashful
to
be
able
to
utter
one
quarter
of
them
as
the
girls
emerged
into
the
room
and
the
light
from
the
great
windows
struck
upon
madeleines
fair
curls
and
the
delicate
pallor
of
her
cheek
as
she
extended
her
hand
and
raised
to
adrians
face
while
she
dropped
her
pretty
curtsey
the
gaze
of
two
unconsciously
plaintive
blue
eyes
the
man
dashed
the
sweat
from
his
brow
with
a
gesture
of
relief
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
the
dark
beauty
of
the
ghost
of
his
dreams
or
its
dashing
presentment
now
smiling
confidently
upon
him
from
tantys
side
he
took
the
little
hand
with
tender
pressure
cciles
daughter
must
be
precious
to
him
in
any
case
madeleine
moreover
had
a
certain
appealing
grace
that
was
apt
to
steal
the
favour
that
molly
won
by
storm
but
indeed
i
could
never
tell
sir
adrian
how
grateful
i
am
said
she
with
a
timidity
that
became
her
as
thoroughly
as
mollys
fearlessness
suited
her
own
stronger
personality
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
again
the
distressful
nightmarelike
feeling
seized
sir
adrians
soul
of
all
characteristics
that
as
the
phrase
is
go
in
families
voices
are
generally
the
most
peculiarly
generic
when
molly
first
addressed
sir
adrian
it
had
been
to
him
as
a
voice
from
the
grave
now
madeleines
gentle
speech
tripped
forth
upon
that
selfsame
notecciles
own
voice
and
next
molly
caught
up
the
sound
and
then
madeleine
answered
again
what
they
said
he
could
not
tell
these
ghoststhese
speaking
ghostsbrought
back
the
old
memories
too
painfully
it
was
thus
ccile
had
spoken
in
the
first
arrogance
of
her
dainty
youth
and
loveliness
and
in
those
softer
tones
when
sorrow
and
work
and
failure
had
subdued
her
proud
spirit
and
now
she
laughs
and
hark
the
laugh
is
echoed
sir
adrian
turns
as
if
to
seek
some
escape
from
this
strange
form
of
torture
meets
ruperts
eye
and
instinctively
braces
himself
into
selfcontrol
come
come
cried
miss
odonoghue
in
her
comfortable
commonplace
cheerful
tone
this
dinner
bell
of
yours
adrian
has
raised
false
hopes
which
seem
to
tarry
in
their
fulfilment
what
are
we
waiting
for
may
i
ask
adrian
looked
at
his
brother
rupert
you
know
my
dear
aunt
he
said
has
the
ordering
of
these
matters
sophia
is
yet
absent
quoth
rupert
drily
but
we
can
proceed
without
her
if
my
aunt
wishes
pooh
yes
sophia
snorted
miss
odonoghue
grasping
sir
adrians
arm
to
show
herself
quite
ready
for
the
march
sophia
we
all
know
what
she
is
why
my
dear
adrian
shell
never
hear
the
bell
till
it
has
stopped
this
half
hour
dinner
cried
rupert
sharply
to
the
butler
whom
his
pull
of
the
bellrope
had
summoned
and
dinner
being
served
the
guests
trooped
into
that
diningroom
which
was
full
of
such
associations
to
sir
adrian
it
was
a
little
thing
but
nevertheless
intensely
galling
to
rupert
to
have
to
play
second
gentleman
and
give
up
his
privileges
as
host
to
his
brother
usually
indeed
adrian
cared
too
little
to
stand
upon
his
rights
and
insisted
upon
ruperts
continuing
to
act
in
his
presence
as
he
did
in
his
absence
but
this
afternoon
tanty
had
left
him
no
choice
nevertheless
as
mr
landale
sat
down
between
the
sisters
and
turned
smiling
to
address
first
one
and
then
the
other
it
would
have
taken
a
very
practised
eye
to
discern
under
the
extra
urbanity
of
his
demeanour
the
intensity
of
his
inward
mortification
he
talked
a
great
deal
and
exerted
himself
to
make
the
sisters
talk
likewise
bantering
molly
into
scornful
and
eager
retorts
and
preventing
madeleine
from
relapsing
into
that
state
of
dreaminess
out
of
which
the
rapid
succession
of
her
recent
sorrow
and
joy
had
somewhat
shaken
her
the
girls
were
both
excited
both
ready
to
laugh
and
jest
tanty
satisfied
to
see
adrian
preside
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
a
grave
courteous
and
selfcontained
manner
that
completely
fulfilled
her
notions
of
what
family
dignity
required
of
him
cracked
her
jokes
ate
her
dinner
and
quaffed
her
cup
with
full
enjoyment
laughing
indulgently
at
her
grandnieces
sallies
and
showing
as
marked
a
disfavour
to
rupert
as
she
deemed
consistent
with
good
manners
the
poor
old
lady
little
guessed
how
the
workings
in
each
brothers
mind
were
all
the
while
silently
but
inevitably
tending
towards
the
destruction
of
her
newly
awakened
hopes





there
was
silence
between
sir
adrian
and
rupert
when
at
last
they
were
left
alone
together
the
elders
gaze
wandering
in
space
his
absent
hand
softly
beating
the
table
his
relaxed
frameall
showed
that
his
mind
was
far
away
from
thought
of
the
youngers
presence
the
relief
to
be
delivered
from
the
twin
echoes
of
a
haunting
voiceonce
the
dearest
on
earth
to
himwas
immense
but
his
whole
being
was
still
quivering
under
the
first
acuteness
of
so
disturbing
an
impression
his
years
of
solitude
moreover
had
ill
prepared
him
for
social
intercourse
the
laughter
the
clash
of
conversation
the
noise
on
every
side
the
length
of
the
meal
the
strain
to
maintain
a
fit
and
proper
attitude
as
host
had
tried
to
the
utmost
nerves
by
nature
hypersensitive
rupert
who
had
leisure
to
study
the
suddenly
lined
and
tired
lineaments
of
the
abstracted
countenance
before
him
noted
with
selfcongratulation
the
change
that
a
few
hours
seemed
to
have
wrought
upon
it
and
decided
that
the
moment
had
come
to
strike
so
adrian
he
said
looking
down
demurely
as
he
spoke
into
the
glass
of
wine
he
had
been
toying
withrupert
was
an
abstemious
man
so
adrian
you
have
been
playing
the
chivalrous
rle
of
rescuer
of
distressed
damselssquire
of
dames
and
what
not
the
last
one
would
have
ascribed
to
you
at
least
at
this
end
of
your
life
ha
throwing
up
his
head
with
a
mirthless
laugh
how
little
any
of
us
would
have
thought
what
a
blessing
in
disguise
your
freak
of
selfexile
was
destined
to
become
to
us
at
the
sound
of
the
incisive
voice
adrian
had
returned
with
a
slight
shiver
from
distant
musing
to
the
consciousness
of
the
others
presence
and
did
you
not
always
look
upon
my
exile
as
a
blessing
undisguised
rupert
answered
he
fixing
his
brother
with
his
large
grave
gaze
ruperts
eyelids
wavered
a
little
beneath
it
but
his
tone
was
coolly
insolent
as
he
made
reply
if
it
pleases
you
to
make
no
count
of
our
fraternal
affection
for
you
my
dear
fellow
if
by
insisting
upon
our
unnatural
depravity
you
contrive
a
more
decent
excuse
for
your
own
vagaries
you
have
my
full
permission
to
dub
me
cain
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
a
light
sigh
escaped
the
elder
man
and
then
he
resolutely
closed
his
lips
it
was
by
behaviour
such
as
this
by
his
almost
diabolical
ingenuity
in
the
art
of
being
uncongenial
that
rupert
had
so
largely
contributed
to
make
his
own
house
impossible
to
him
but
where
was
the
use
of
either
argument
or
expostulation
with
one
so
incapable
of
even
understanding
the
mainsprings
of
his
actions
moreover
he
above
all
must
not
forget
it
rupert
had
suffered
through
him
in
pride
and
selfesteem
and
yet
despite
sir
adrians
philosophic
mind
despite
his
vast
pessimistic
though
benevolent
tolerance
for
erring
human
nature
his
was
a
very
human
heart
and
it
added
not
a
little
to
the
sadness
of
his
lot
at
every
return
to
pulwick
dating
from
that
first
most
bitter
homecoming
to
feel
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
how
little
welcome
he
was
where
the
ties
of
flesh
and
blood
alone
not
to
speak
of
his
most
ceaseless
yet
delicate
generosity
should
have
ensured
him
a
very
different
reception
again
he
sighed
this
time
more
deeply
and
the
corners
of
ruperts
lips
the
arch
of
his
eyebrows
moved
upwards
in
smiling
interrogation
it
must
have
given
you
a
shock
said
mr
landale
carelessly
to
see
the
resemblance
between
molly
and
poor
ccile
not
of
course
that
i
can
remember
her
but
tanty
says
it
is
something
startling
adrian
assented
briefly
i
daresay
it
seems
quite
painful
to
you
at
first
proceeded
rupert
much
in
the
same
deliberate
manner
as
a
surgeon
may
lay
bare
a
wound
despite
the
knowledge
of
the
suffering
he
is
inflicting
i
noticed
that
you
seemed
upset
during
dinner
but
probably
the
feeling
will
wear
off
probably
madeleine
resembles
her
father
i
am
told
but
then
you
never
saw
the
feu
comte
did
you
well
they
are
both
fine
handsome
girls
full
of
life
and
spirits
it
is
our
revered
relatives
intention
to
leave
them
hereas
perhaps
she
has
told
youfor
two
months
or
so
i
have
begged
her
said
sir
adrian
gravely
to
make
them
understand
that
i
wish
them
to
look
upon
pulwick
as
their
home
very
right
very
proper
cried
the
other
in
fact
i
knew
that
was
what
you
would
wishand
your
wishes
of
course
are
my
law
in
the
matter
by
the
way
i
hope
you
quite
understand
adrian
how
it
happened
that
i
did
not
notify
to
you
the
arrival
of
these
guests
extraordinaryknowing
that
you
have
never
got
over
their
mothers
death
and
all
thatit
was
entirely
from
a
wish
to
spare
you
besides
there
was
your
general
prohibition
about
my
visitors
i
did
not
dare
to
take
the
responsibility
in
fact
and
so
i
told
tanty
i
do
not
wish
to
doubt
the
purity
of
your
motives
though
it
would
have
grieved
me
had
these
visitors
no
ordinary
ones
as
you
yourself
admit
come
and
gone
without
my
knowledge
as
it
fell
out
however
even
without
that
childs
dangerous
expedition
i
should
have
been
informed
in
any
caseren
knew
ren
knew
cried
rupert
surprised
and
damn
ren
to
himself
with
heartfelt
energy
that
the
infernal
little
spy
as
he
deemed
his
brothers
servant
should
have
made
a
visit
to
pulwick
without
his
knowledge
was
unpleasant
news
and
it
touched
him
on
his
tenderest
point
but
now
replenishing
his
halfemptied
glass
to
give
adrian
no
excuse
for
putting
an
end
to
the
conference
before
he
himself
desired
it
he
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
task
he
had
set
himself
without
further
delay
and
what
would
you
wish
me
to
do
adrian
he
asked
with
a
pretty
air
of
deference
in
the
matter
of
entertaining
these
ladies
i
have
thought
of
several
things
likely
to
afford
them
amusement
but
since
you
are
here
you
will
readily
understand
that
i
should
like
your
authorisation
first
i
am
anxious
to
consult
you
when
i
can
he
added
apologetically
so
forgive
my
attacking
you
upon
business
tonight
when
you
seem
really
so
little
fitted
for
itbut
you
know
one
cannot
count
upon
you
from
one
minute
to
another
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
to
issue
invitations
for
a
ball
pulwick
was
noted
for
its
hospitality
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
and
the
gloom
that
has
hung
over
the
old
home
these
last
eight
years
has
been
i
suppose
unavoidable
in
the
circumstancesbut
none
the
less
a
pity
no
fear
but
that
our
fair
cousins
would
enjoy
such
a
festivity
and
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
the
sound
of
our
revels
should
not
reach
as
far
as
your
hermitage
a
slow
colour
had
mounted
to
adrians
cheeks
he
drew
his
brows
together
with
an
air
of
displeasure
rupert
quick
to
read
these
symptoms
hastened
to
pursue
the
attack
before
response
should
be
made
the
idea
does
not
seem
to
please
you
he
cried
as
if
in
hurt
surprise
tis
true
i
have
now
no
legal
right
to
think
of
reviving
the
old
hospitable
traditions
of
the
family
but
you
must
remember
adrian
you
yourself
have
insisted
on
giving
me
a
moral
right
to
act
host
here
in
your
absenceyou
have
over
and
over
again
laid
stress
upon
the
freedom
you
wished
me
to
feel
in
the
matter
hitherto
i
have
not
made
use
of
these
privileges
have
not
cared
to
do
so
beyond
an
occasional
duty
dinner
to
our
nearest
neighbours
a
lonely
widower
like
myself
why
should
i
but
now
with
these
gay
young
things
in
the
houseso
near
to
us
in
bloodi
had
thought
it
so
much
our
duty
to
provide
fitting
entertainment
for
them
that
your
attitude
is
incomprehensible
to
me
come
does
it
not
strike
you
as
savouring
a
little
of
the
unamiable
dog
in
the
fable
i
know
you
hate
company
yourself
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
how
can
these
things
here
affect
you
upon
your
island
as
for
the
budget
it
will
stand
it
i
assure
you
i
speak
hotly
pray
excuse
me
i
own
i
have
looked
forward
to
the
thought
of
seeing
once
more
young
and
happy
faces
around
me
you
mistake
me
said
sir
adrian
with
an
effort
while
you
are
acting
as
my
representative
you
have
as
you
know
all
liberty
to
entertain
what
guests
you
choose
and
as
you
see
fit
it
is
natural
perhaps
that
you
should
now
believe
me
anxious
to
hurry
back
to
the
lighthouse
and
i
should
have
told
you
before
that
it
is
my
intention
this
time
to
remain
longer
than
my
wont
in
which
circumstance
the
arrangements
for
the
entertaining
of
our
relatives
will
devolve
upon
myself
rupert
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
forgive
me
but
the
idea
is
too
ludicrous
what
sort
of
funeral
festivities
do
you
propose
to
provide
to
the
neighbourhood
with
you
and
sophia
presiding
the
living
images
of
mourning
and
desolation
there
my
dear
fellow
i
must
laugh
it
will
be
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
with
a
vengeance
why
even
tonight
in
the
bosom
of
your
family
as
it
were
your
presence
lay
so
like
a
wet
blanket
upon
us
all
that
pon
my
soul
i
nearly
cracked
my
voice
trying
to
keep
those
girls
from
noticing
it
seriously
i
am
delighted
of
course
that
you
should
feel
so
sportive
and
it
is
high
time
indeed
that
the
neighbourhood
should
see
something
of
you
but
i
fear
you
are
reckoning
beyond
your
strength
anyhow
command
me
i
shall
be
anxious
to
help
you
all
i
can
in
this
novel
departure
what
are
your
plans
i
have
laid
no
plans
answered
sir
adrian
coldly
after
a
slight
pause
but
you
do
not
need
me
to
tell
you
rupert
that
to
surround
myself
with
such
gaiety
as
you
suggest
is
impossible
you
mean
to
make
our
poor
little
cousins
lead
as
melancholy
an
existence
as
you
do
yourself
then
cried
rupert
with
an
angry
laugh
matters
were
not
progressing
as
he
could
have
wished
i
fear
this
will
cause
a
good
deal
of
disappointment
not
only
to
them
but
to
our
revered
auntfor
she
is
very
naturally
anxious
to
see
her
charges
married
and
settled
and
she
told
me
that
she
more
or
less
counted
upon
my
aid
in
the
matter
now
as
you
are
here
of
course
i
have
thank
heaven
nothing
more
to
say
one
way
or
another
but
you
will
surely
think
of
asking
a
few
likely
young
fellows
over
to
the
house
occasionally
we
are
not
badly
off
for
eldest
sons
in
the
neighbourhood
molly
who
is
as
arrant
a
little
flirt
they
tell
me
as
she
is
pretty
will
be
grateful
to
you
for
the
attention
on
the
score
of
amusement
at
least
mr
landale
speaking
somewhat
at

out
of
his
annoyance
to
have
failed
in
immediately
disgusting
the
hermit
of
the
responsibilities
his
return
home
might
entail
here

still
making
love
coquetting
before
his

intolerable
to

have
to
look
on
and
see
cciles
eyes
lavish
glances
of
love
her
lips
soft
words

from

made
him
for
a

almost

beyond

it
was

to

altogether
the

through
the

adrian
was
distinctly
conscious
of
the
underlying
duplicity
the
unworthy
motives
which
had
prompted

he
rose
from

how
much
better
i

i
admit
nevertheless
the

of
all
you

right
that

that

moved
away
leaving

motionless
in

did

the

and

on
the
evening
of
the
day
which
had
seen
miss
mollys
departure
for
the
main
land
ren
after
the
usual
brisk
postprandial
altercation
with
old
margery
by
her
kitchen
fire
was
cheerfully
finding
his
way
lantern
in
hand
to
his
turret
when
in
the
silence
of
the
night
he
heard
the
door
of
the
keep
open
and
close
and
presently
recognised
sir
adrians
tread
echoing
on
the
flagged
steps
beneath
him
astonished
at
this
premature
return
and
full
of
vague
dismay
he
hurried
down
to
receive
his
master
there
was
a
cloud
on
sir
adrians
face
plainly
discernible
in
spite
of
the
unaltered
composure
of
his
manner
i
did
not
expect
your
honour
back
so
soon
said
ren
tentatively
i
myself
did
not
anticipate
to
return
i
had
thought
i
might
perhaps
stay
some
days
at
pulwick
but
i
find
there
is
no
home
like
this
one
for
me
ren
there
was
a
long
silence
but
when
ren
had
rekindled
a
blaze
upon
the
hearth
and
set
the
lamp
upon
the
table
he
stood
a
moment
before
withdrawing
almost
begging
by
his
look
some
further
crumb
of
information
my
room
is
ready
i
suppose
inquired
sir

yes
your

quoth
the
man
ruefully

and
i
put
it
back
exactly
asas
before
goodnight
then
goodnight
said
the
master
after
a
pause
warming
his
hands
as
the
flames
began
to
leap
through
the
network
of
twigs

ren
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
caught
the
sound
of
a
sigh
coming
from
the
hearthside
and
shaking
his
head
in
silence
obeyed
the
implied
dismissal
and
bitterly
did
he
meditate
in
his
bunk
that
night
upon
the
swift
crumbling
of
those
aircastles
he
had
built
himself
so
gaily
erstwhile
in
the
rose
and
blue
atmosphere
that
la
demoiselle
had
seemed
to
bring
with
her
to
scarthey





from
the
morrow
the
old
regular
mode
of
life
began
again
in
the
keep
sir
adrian
read
a
good
deal
or
at
least
appeared
so
to
do
but
ren
who
kept
him
more
than
ever
under
his
glances
of
wistful
sympathy
noted
that
far
from
being
absorbed
as
of
old
in
the
pages
of
his
book
the
recluses
eyes
wandered
much
off
its
edges
into
space
that
when
writing
or
at
least
intent
on
writing
his
pen
would
linger
long
in
the
bottle
and
hover
listlessly
over
the
paper
that
he
was
more
abstracted
even
than
his
wont
when
looking
out
of
the
eastern
window
and
that
on
the
platform
of
the
beacon
it
was
the
landward
view
which
most
drew
his
gaze
there
was
also
more
music
in
the
keep
than
was
the
custom
in
evener
days
seated
at
his
organ
the
lightkeeper
seemed
to
find
a
voice
for
such
thoughts
as
were
not
to
be
spoken
or
written
and
relief
for
the
nameless
pity
of
them
but
never
a
word
passed
between
the
two
men
on
the
subject
that
filled
both
their
hearts
it
was
sir
adrians
pleasure
that
things
at
scarthey
should
seem
to
be
exactly
the
same
as
before
and
that
was
enough
for
ren
and
yet
mused
the
faithful
fellow
within
his
disturbed
mind
the
ruins
now
look
like
a
house
the
day
after
an
interment
if
we
were
lonely
before
my
faith
now
we
are
desolate
and
trying
to
find
something
or
somebody
to
charge
with
the
curse
of
it
he
invariably
fell
to
upon
mr
landales
sleek
head
why
he
could
hardly
have
explained
three
new
days
had
thus
passed
in
the
regularity
if
not
the
serenity
of
the
oldthey
seemed
old
already
buried
far
back
in
the
past
those
days
that
had
lapsed
so
evenly
before
the
brightness
of
youthful
and
beautiful
life
had
entered
the
keep
for
one
brief
moment
and
departing
again
left
it
a
ruin
indeedwhen
the
retirement
of
scarthey
was
once
more
invaded
by
an
unexpected
visitor
it
was
about
sundown
of
the
shortest
day
sir
adrian
was
at
his
organ
almost
unconsciously
interpreting
his
own
sadness
into
music
in
time
the
yearning
of
his
soul
had
had
expression
the
echo
of
the
last
sighing
chord
died
away
in
the
tranquil
air
yet
the
musician
with
head
bent
upon
his
breast
remained
lost
in
faraway
thoughts
a
slight
shuffling
noise
disturbed
him
turning
round
to
greet
ren
as
he
supposed
he
was
astonished
to
see
a
mans
figure
lolling
in
his
own
armchair
as
he
peered
inquiringly
into
the
twilight
the
intruder
rose
to
his
feet
and
cried
with
a
voice
loud
and
clear
pleasant
withal
to
the
ear
sir
adrian
i
am
sorry
you
have
stopped
so
soon
i
never
heard
anything
more
beautiful
the
door
was
ajar
and
i
crept
in
like
a
cat
not
to
disturb
you
still
in
doubt
but
with
his
fine
air
of
courtesy
the
lightkeeper
advanced
towards
the
uninvited
guest

some
hesitation

my
dear
fellow
jack
smith
at
your
service
please
to
remember
answered
the
visitor
with
a
genial
ring
of
laughter
in
his
words
not
that
it
matters
much
here
i
suppose
had
i
not
heard
the
peal
of
your
organ
i
should
have
thought
scarthey
deserted
indeed
i
could
find
no
groom
of
the
chambers
to
announce
me
in
due
form
as
he
spoke
the
two
had
drawn
near
each
other
and
clasped
hands
heartily
now
to
think
of
your
knowing
my
voice
in
this
manner
you
have
a
devilish
knack
of
spotting
your
man
sir
adrian
it
is
almost
four
years
since
i
was
here
last
is
it
not
four
yearsso
it
is
and
four
years
that
have
done
well
by
you
it
would
appear
what
a
picture
of
strength
and
lustiness
it
really
seems
to
regenerate
one
and
put
heart
of
grace
in
one
only
to
take
you

handwelcome
captain
smith
nothing
could
have
more
succinctly
described
the
outer
man
of
him
who
chose
to
be
known
by
that
most
nondescript
of
patronymics
sir
adrian
stood
for
a
moment
contemplating
with
glances
of
approval
such
as
he
seldom
bestowed
on
his
fellowman
the
symmetrical
slender
yet
vigorous
figure
of
his
friend
and
responding
with
an
unwonted
cheerfulness
to
the
smile
that
lit
up
the
steelblue
eyes
and
parted
the
shapely
strong
and
goodhumoured
mouth
of
the
privateersman
dear
me
and
what
a
buck
we
have
become
continued
the
baronet
what
splendid
plumage
it
is
good
to
see
you
so
prosperous
and
so
this
is
the
latest
fashion
no
doubt
it
sets
forth
the
frame
of
a
goodly
man
though
no
one
could
guess
at
the
sea
dog
beneath
such
a
set
of
garments
i
used
to
consider
my
brother
rupert
the
most
especial
dandy
i
had
ever
seen
but
that
evidently
was
my
limited
experience
even
rupert
cannot
display
so
perfect
a
fit
in
bottlegreen
coats
so
faultless
a
silken
stock
buckskins
of
such
matchless
drab
captain
jack
laughed
blushed
slightly
under
the
friendly
banter
and
allowed
himself
to
be
thrust
back
into
the
seat
he
had
just
vacated
welcome
again
on
my
lonely
estate
i
hope
this
is
not
to
be
a
mere
flying
visit
you
know
my
misanthropy
vanishes
when
i
have
your
company
how
did
you
come
not
by
the
causeway
i
should
say
smiling
again
and
glancing
at
the
unblemished
topboots
i
have
two
men
waiting
for
me
in
the
gig
below
my
schooner
the
peregrine
lies
in
the
offing
the
elder
man
turned
to
the
window
and
through
the
grey
curtain
of
crepuscule
recognised
the
rakish
topsail
schooner
that
had
excited
mollys
admiration
some
days
before
he
gazed
forth
upon
it
a
few
meditative
moments
not
knowing
whether
i
would
find
you
ready
to
receive
me
pursued
the
captain
i
arranged
that
the
peregrine
was
to
wait
for
me
if
i
had
to
return
tonight
which
of
course
is
not
to
be
heard
of
said
sir
adrian
here
is
renny
he
will
carry
word
that
with
me
you
remain
tonight
come
renny
do
you
recognise
an
old
acquaintance
already
well
disposed
towards
any
one
who
could
call
this
note
of
pleasure
into
the
loved
voice
the
breton
who
had
just
entered
turned
to
give
a
broad
stare
at
the
handsome
stranger
then
burst
into
a
guffaw
of
pure
delight
by
my
faith
it
is
mr
the
lieutenant
he
ejaculated
adding
as
ingeniously
as
tanty
herself
might
have
done
that
he
would
never
have
known
him
again
it
is
mr
the
captain
now
renny
said
that
person
and
held
out
a
strong
hand
to
grip
that
of
the
little
frenchman
which
the
latter
after
the
preliminary
rubbing
upon
his
trousers
that
his
code
of
manners
enjoined
readily
extended
ah
it
is
a
good
wind
that
sent
you
here
this
day
said
he
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
when
this
ceremony
had
been
duly
gone
through
you
say
well
acquiesced
his
master
it
has
ever
been
a
good
wind
that
has
brought
captain
jack
across
my
path
and
then
receiving
directions
to
refresh
the
gigs
crew
and
dismiss
them
back
to
their
ship
with
instructions
to
return
for
orders
on
the
morrow
the
servant
hurried
forth
leaving
the
two
friends
once
more
alone
thanks
said
captain
jack
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
the
messenger
that
will
exactly
suit
my
purpose
i
have
a
good
many
things
to
talk
over
with
you
since
you
so
kindly
give
me
the
opportunity
in
the
first
place
let
me
unburden
myself
of
a
debt
which
is
now
of
old
standingand
let
me
say
at
the
same
time
added
the
young
man
rising
to
deposit
upon
the
table
a
lettercase
which
he
had
taken
from
his
breastpocket
that
though
my
actual
debt
is
now
met
my
obligation
to
you
remains
the
same
and
will
always
be
so
you
said
just
now
that
i
looked
prosperous
and
so
i
amowing
somewhat
to
good
luck
it
is
true
but
owing
above
all
to
you
no
luck
would
have
availed
me
much
without
that
to
start
upon
and
he
pointed
to
the
contents
of
the
case
a
thick
bundle
of
notes
which
his
host
was
now
smilingly
turning
over
with
the
tip
of
his
fingers
i
might
have
sent
you
a
draft
but
there
is
no
letterpost
that
i
know
of
to
scarthey
and
besides
it
struck
me
that
just
as
these
four
thousand
pounds
had
privately
passed
between
you
and
me
you
might
prefer
them
to
be
returned
in
the
same
manner
i
prefer
it
since
it
has
brought
you
in
person
said
sir
adrian
thrusting
the
parcel
into
a
drawer
and
pulling
his
chair
closer
towards
his
guest
dealings
with
a
man
like
you
give
one
a
taste
of
an
ideal
world
would
that
more
human
transactions
could
be
carried
out
in
so
simple
and
frank
a
manner
as
this
little
business
of
ours
captain
jack
laughed
outright
upon
my
word
you
are
a
greater
marvel
to
me
every
time
i
see
youwhich
is
not
by
any
means
often
enough
the
other
raised
his
eyebrows
in
interrogation
and
the
sailor
went
on
is
it
really
possible
that
it
is
to
my
mode
of
dealing
that
you
attribute
the
delightful
simplicity
of
a
transaction
involving
a
little
fortune
from
hand
to
hand
and
where
pray
in
this
terraqueous
sublunary
spherei
heard
that
good
phrase
from
a
literary
exquisite
at
bath
and
it
seems
to
me
comprehensivewhere
then
on
this
terraqueous
sublunary
globe
of
ours
sir
adrian
landale
could
one
expect
to
find
another
person
ready
to
lend
a
privateersman
trading
under
an
irresponsible
name
the
sum
of
four
thousand
pounds
without
any
other
security
than
his
volunteered
promise
to
return
itif
possible
sir
adrian
ignoring
the
tribute
to
his
own
merits
arose
and
placed
his
friendly
hand
on
the
speakers
shoulder
and
now
my
dear
jack
he
said
gravely
that
the
war
is
over
you
will
have
to
turn
your
energies
in
another
direction
i
am
glad
you
are
out
of
that
unworthy
trade
captain
jack
bounded
up
no
no
sir
adrian
i
value
your
opinion
too
much
to
allow
such
a
statement
to
pass
unchallenged
unworthy
trade
we
have
not
given
back
those
french
devils
one
half
of
the
harm
they
have
done
to
our
own
merchant
service
it
was
war
you
know
and
you
know
also
or
perhaps
you
dontin
which
case
let
me
tell
youthat
my
cormorant
has
made
her
goodly
name
ay
and
brought
her
commander
a
fair
share
of
his
credit
by
her
energy
in
bringing
to
an
incredible
number
of
those
dd
french
sharksbeg
pardon
but
you
know
the
pestilent
breed
well
we
shall
never
agree
upon
the
subject
i
fear
as
for
me
the
smart
of
the
salt
air
the
sting
of
the
salt
breeze
the
fighting
the
danger
they
have
got
into
my
blood
and
even
now
it
sometimes
comes
over
me
that
life
will
not
be
perfect
life
to
me
without
the
dancing
boards
under
my
feet
and
the
free
waves
around
me
and
my
jolly
boys
to
lead
to
death
or
glory
yet
could
you
but
know
it
this
is
the
veriest
treason
and
i
revoke
the
words
a
thousand
times
you
look
amazed
and
well
you
may
ah
i
have
much
to
tell
you
but
i
take
it
you
will
not
care
to
hear
all
i
have
been
able
to
achieve
on
the
basis
of
your
munificent
help
at
myahem
unworthy
trade
well
no
said
sir
adrian
smiling
i
can
quite
imagine
it
and
imagine
it
without
enthusiasm
though
perhaps
as
you
say
such
things
have
to
be
but
i
should
like
to
know
of
these
present
circumstances
these
prospects
which
make
you
look
so
happy
no
doubt
the
fruits
of
peace
yes
i
suppose
in
one
way
they
may
be
called
so
yet
without
the
war
and
your
helping
hand
they
would
even
now
hang
as
far
from
me
as
the
grapes
from
the
foxwhen
i
arrived
in
england
three
months
after
the
peace
had
been
signed
i
had
accumulated
in
the
books
of
certain
banks
a
tolerably
respectable
account
to
the
credit
of
a
certain
person
whose
name
oddly
enough
you
on
one
or
two
occasions
have
applied
absently
to
captain
jack
smith
i
was
i
will
own
already
feeling
inclined
to
discuss
with
myself
the
propriety
of
assuming
the
name
in
question
when
there
came
something
in
my
way
of
which
i
shall
tell
you
presently
which
something
has
made
me
resolve
to
remain
captain
smith
for
some
time
longer
the
old
cormorant
lay
at
bristol
and
being
too
big
for
this
new
purpose
i
sold
her
it
was
like
cutting
off
a
limb
i
loved
every
plank
of
her
knew
every
frisk
of
her
she
served
me
well
to
the
end
for
she
fetched
her
valuealmost
next
having
time
on
my
hands
i
bethought
myself
of
seeing
again
a
little
of
the
world
and
when
i
tell
you
that
i
drove
over
to
bath
you
may
perhaps
begin
to
see
what
i
am
coming
to
sir
adrian
suddenly
turned
in
his
chair
to
face
his
friend
again
with
a
look
of
singular
attention
well
no
not
exactly
and
yetunless
pshaw
impossible
upon
which
lucid
commentary
he
stopped
gazing
with
anxious
inquiry
into
captain
jacks
smiling
eyes
ah
i
believe
you
have
just
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
with
that
confounded
perspicacity
of
yours
saying
which
the
sailor
laughed
and
blushed
not
unbecomingly
this
is
how
it
came
about
i
had
transactions
with
old
john
harewood
the
banker
in
bristol
transactions
advantageous
to
both
sides
but
perhaps
most
to
himsly
old
dog
at
any
rate
the
old
fellow
took
a
monstrous
fancy
to
me
over
his
claret
and
when
i
mentioned
bath
recommended
me
to
call
upon
his
wife
a
very
fine
dame
who
prefers
the
fashion
of
the
spa
to
the
business
of
bristol
and
consequently
lives
as
much
in
the
former
place
as
good
john
harewood

allow
well
you

at
my
looking

happy

maria

i
met
one
who
if
i
mistake
not
is
of
your
kin
already
then
somewhere
at
the
back
of
my
memory
dwelt
the
name
of

bless
me
i
have
surely
said
nothing
to
the
young
man
broke
off
disconcerted
sir
adrians
face
had
become
unwontedly
clouded
but
he
waved
the
speaker
on
impatiently
no
no

am
surprised

course
only
surprised

jack
pursued
pacing
enthusiastically
about
i
have
been
no
saint
and
no
doubt
i
have
fancied
myself
as
a
lover
once
or
twice
ere
this
but
to
see
that
girl
sir
means
a
change
in
a
mans
life
to
have
met
the
light
of
those
sweet
eyes

the
lovers
face
was
illumined
he
walked
the
room
like
one
treading
on
air
as
the
joy
within
him
found
its
voice
in
words
sir
adrian
listened
with
an
extraordinary
tightness
at
his
heart
he
had
loved
one
woman
even
so
that
love
was
still
with
him
as
the
scent
clings
to
the
phial
but
the
sight
of
this
young
joyful
love
made
him
feel
old
in
that
hourold
as
he
had
never
realised
before
there
was
no
room
in
his
being
for
such
love
again
and
yet
there
was
a
tremulous
anxiety
in
the
question
he
put
after
a
short
pause
there
are
two
demoiselles

turned
on

exclaimed
enthusiastically
to
me
there
is
but
oneone
woman
in
the
worldmadeleine
his
look
met
that
of
sir
adrian
in
full
and
even
in
the
midst
of
his
own
selfcentred
mood
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
transient
gleam
that
shot
in
the
elders
eyes
and
the
sudden
relaxation
of
his
features
he
pondered
for
a
moment
or
two
scanning
the
while
the
countenance
of
the
recluse
then
a
smile
lighted
up
his
own
bronzed
face
in
a
very
sweet
and
winning
way
as
her
kinsman
have
i
your
approval
he
asked
and
proceeded
earnestly
to
tell
the
truth
at
once
i
was
looking
to
even
more
than
your
approvalto
your
support
sir
adrians
mood
had
undergone
a
change
as
a
breeze
sweeping
from
a
new
quarter
clears
in
a
moment
a
darkening
mist
from
the
face
of
the
earth
captain
jacks
answer
had
blown
away
for
the
nonce
the
atmosphere
of
misgiving
that
enveloped
him
he
answered
promptly
and
with
warmth
being
your
friend
i
am
glad
to
know
of
this
being
her
kinsman
i
may
add
my
dear
hubertthere
was
just
a
tinge
of
hesitation
followed
by
a
certain
emphasis
on
the
change
of
namei
promise
to
support
you
in
your
hopes
in
so
far
as
i
have
any
influence
for
power
or
right
over
my
cousin

none
the
sailor
threw
himself
down
once
more
in
his
armchair
and
tapping
his
shining
hessians
with
the
stem
of
his
long
clay
in
smiling
abstraction
began
with
all
a
lovers
egotism
to
expatiate
on
the
theme
that
filled
his
heart
it
is
a
singular
an
admirable
a
never
sufficientlytobepraised
conjunction
of
affairs
which
has
ultimately
brought
me
near
you
when
i
was
pursuing
the
light
o
my
heart
ruthlessly
snatched
away
by
a
cunning
and
implacable
dragon
known
to
you
as
miss
odonoghue
i
say
dragon
in
courtesy
i
called
her
by
better
names
before
i
realised
what
a
service
she
was
unconsciously
rendering
us
by
this
sudden
removal
known
to
me
laughed
sir
adrian
my
own
mothers
sister
then
i
still
further
retract
moreover
seeing
how
things
have
turned
out
i
must
now
regard
her
as
an
angel
in
disguise
dont
look
so
surprised
has
she
not
brought
my
love
under
your
protection
i
thought
i
was
tolerably
proof
against
the
little
god
but
then
he
had
never
shot
his
arrows
at
me
from
between
the
long
lashes
of
madeleine
de
savenaye
oh
those
eyes
adrian
so
unlike
those
southern
eyes
i
have
known
so
well
too
well
in
other
days
brilliant
hard
challenging
battle
from
the
first
glance
and
yet
from
the
first
promising
that
surrender
which
is
ever
so
speedy
pah
no
more
of
such
memories
before
her
blue
eyes

my
first
introduction
i
feltwell
i
felt
as
the
novice
does
under
the
first
broadside
the
speaker
looked
dreamily
into
space
as

the
delicious
moment
rose
again
panoramically

as
i
heard
her
call
your
humble
servanti
was
a
hero
sir
a
perfect
hero
of
romance
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
on
the
strength
of
this
renown
thrust
upon
me
i
found
grace
before
the
most
adorable
blue
eyes
had
words
of
sympathy
from
the
sweetest
lips
and
smiles
from
the
most
bewitching
little
mouth
in
all
the
world
so
you
see
i
owe
poor
lady
maria
a
good
thought
you
laugh
sir
adrian
was
smiling
but
all
in
benevolence
at
the
artlessness
of
this
eager
youth
who
in
all
the
unconscious
glory
of
his
looks
and
strength
ascribed
the
credit
of
his
entrance
into
a
maidens
heart
to
the
virtue
of
a
few
irresponsible
words
of
recommendation
ah
those
were
days
everything
went
on
smoothly
and
i
was
debating
with
myself
whether
i
would
not
at
once
boldly
ask
her
to
be
the
wife
of
hubert
cochrane
though
the
casting
of
jack
smiths
skin
would
have
necessitated
the
giving
up
of
several
of
his
freetrading
engagements
free
trading
you
do
not
mean
to
say
man
alive
that
you
have
turned
smuggler
now
interrupted
sir
adrian
aghast
smuggler
cried
jack
with
his
frank
laugh
peace
i
beg
friend
miscall
not
a
gentleman
thus
smugglerpirate
i
cut
a
pretty
figure
evidently
in
your
worships
eyes
lucky
for
me
you
never
would
be
sworn
as
a
magistrate
or
where
should
i
be

and
you
too
between
duty
and
friendshipbut
to
proceed
i
was
about
as
i
have
said
to
give
that
up
for
the
reasons
i
mentioned
when
upon
a
certain
fine
evening
i
crossed
the
path
of
one
of
the
most
masterful
old
maids
i
have
ever
seen
or
even
heard
of
and
would
you
believe
itthis
with
a
quizzical
look
at
his
hosts
grave
facethis
misguided
old
lady
took
such
a
violent
dislike
to
me
at
first
sight
and
expressed
it
so
thoroughly
well
that
hang
me
if
i
was
not
completely
brought
to
and
all
for
escorting
my
dear
one
from
lady
marias
house
to
her
own
well
the
walk
was
worth
itthough
the
old
crocodile
was
on
the
watch
for
us
ready
to
snap
had
got
wind
of
the
secret
somehow
a
secret
unspoken
even
between
us
two
this
first
and
last
interview
took
place
on
the
flags
in
front
of
no
17
camden
place
bath
oh
it
was
a
very
onesided
affair
from
the
beginning
and
ended
abruptly
in
a
door
being
banged
in
my
face
then
i
heard
about
miss
odonoghues
peculiarities
in
the
direction
of
exclusiveness
and
then
also
oddly
enough
for
the
first
time
of
the
great
fortune
going
with
my
madeleines
hand
of
course
i
saw
it
all
and
i
may
say
forgave
the
old
lady
in
short
i
realised
that
in
miss
odonoghues
mind
i
am
nothing
but
an
unprincipled
fortuneseeker
and
adventurer
now
you
adrian
can
vouch
that
whatever
my
faults
i
am
none
such
sir
adrian
threw
a
quiet
glance
at
his
friend
whose
eyes
sparkled
as
they
met
it
god
knows
continued
the
latter
that
all
i
care
for
concerning
the
money
is
that
she
may
have
it
this
last
venture
the
biggest
and
most
difficult
of
all
i
then
decided
to
undertake
that
i
might
be
the
fitter
mate
for
the
heiressbless
her
oh
adrian
man
could
you
have
seen
her
sweet
tearful
face
that
night
you
would
understand
that
i
could
not
rest
upon
such
a
parting
in
the
dawn
of
the
next
morning
i
was
in
the
streetnot
so
much
upon
the
chance
of
meeting
though
i
knew
that
such
sweetness
would
have
now
to
be
all
stolenbut
to
watch
her
door
her
window
a
lovers
trick
rewarded
by
lovers
luck
leaning
on
the
railings
through
the
cold
mist
cold
it
was
though
i
never
felt
it
but
i
mind
me
now
how
the
icicles
broke
under
my
hand
what
should
i
see
before
even
the
churchbells
had
set
to
chiming
or
the
yawning
sluts
to
pull
the
kitchen
curtains
but
a
bloated
monster
of
a
coach
dragging
and
sliding
up
the
street
to
halt
at
her
very
door
then
out
came
the
beldam
herself
and
two
muffledup
slender
thingsmy
madeleine
one
of
course
but
i
had
a
regular
turn
at
sight
of
them
for
i
swear
i
could
not
tell
which
was
which
off
rattled
the
chariot
at
a
smart
pace
and
there
i
stood
friend
feeling
as
if
my
heart
was
tied
behind
with
the
trunks
the
sailor
laughed
ran
his
fingers
through
his
curls
and
stamped
in
lively
recollection
nothing
to
be
drawn
from
their
landlady
but
i
am
not
the
man
to
allow
a
prize
to
be
snatched
from
under
my
very
nose

clearing
for

so
to
speaki
ran
out
and
overtook
the
ostler

i
had
seen
putting
the
finishing
touch
to
the
lashing
of
boxes
behind

the

worth
the
guinea
it
cost
me
a
hundred
times
overin
less
than
an
hour
i
was
in
the
saddle
ready
for
pursuit
cantering
boot
to
boot
with
my
mana
trusty
fellow
who
knows
how
to
hold
his
tongue
and
can
sit
a
horse
in
the
bargain
neither
at
gloucester
nor
the
next
day
up
to
worcester
could
we
succeed
in
doing
more
than
keep
our
fugitives
in
view
when
they
had
alighted
at
one
inn
as
ascertained
by
my
squire
we
patronised
the
opposition
hostelry
and
the
ensuing
morning
cantered
steadily
in
pursuit
on
our
new
posthorses
half
an
hour
after
they
had
rumbled
away
with
their
relays
but
the
evening
of
our
arrival
at
worcester
my
fellow
found
out
at
last
what
the
next
stage
was
to
be
andclever
chap
he
lost
nothing
for
his
sharpnessthat
the
three
kings
heads
had
been
recommended
to
the
old
lady
as
the
best
house
in
shrewsbury
this
time
we
took
the
lead
and
on
to
shrewsbury
and
were
at
the
glorious
old
kings
heads
i
in
a
private
room
tight
as
wax
a
good
couple
of
hours
before
the
chariot
made
its
appearance
and
there
man
there
my
pretty
one
and
i
met
again
that
was
no
doubt
put
in
sir
adrian
in
his
gentle
indulgent
way
what
made
the
kings
heads
so
glorious
ay
right
and
yet
it
was
but
a
few
seconds
on
the
stair
under
a
smoky
lamp
but
her
beauty
filled
the
landing
with
radiance
as
her
kindness
did
my
soulit
was
but
for
a
moment
all
blessed
moment
too
brief
alas
ah
adrian
friendold
hermit
in
your
cellyou
have
never
known
life
you
who
have
never
tasted
a
moment
such
as
that
then
we
started
apart
there
was
a
noise
below
and
she
had
only
time
to
whisper
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
pulwick
to
some
relativeshad
only
heard
it
that
very
daywhen
steps
came
up
the
stairs
creaking
with
a
last
promise
a
last
word
of
love
i
leaped
back
into
my
own
chamber
there
to
see
through
the
chink
between
door
and
post
the
untimely
old
mischiefmaker
herself
pass
slowly
sour
and
solemn
towards
her
apartments
leaning
upon
her
other
nieces
arm
how
could
i
have
thought
that
baggage
like
my
princess
handsome
if
you
will
but
with
her
saucy
eye
her
raven
head
her
brown
cheek
no
more
to
be
compared
to
my
stately
lily
than
brass
to
gold
the
host
listening
wonderingly
his
eyes
fixed
with
kindly
gravity
upon
the
speaker
as
he
rattled
on
here
gave
a
slight
start
all
unnoticed
of
his
friend
the
next
morning
when
i
had
seen
the
coach
and
its
precious
freight
move
on
once
more
northward
i
began
the
retreat
south
hugging
myself
upon
luck
and
success
i
had
business
in
salcombeperhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
the
salcombe
schoonersin
connection
with
the
fitting
out
of
that
sailing
wonder
the
peregrine
and
so
concluded
captain
jack
laughing
again
in
exuberance
of
joy
you
may
possibly
guess
one
of
the
reasons
that
has
brought
her
and
me
round
by
your
island
there
ensued
a
long
silence
filled
with
thoughts
equally
pressing
though
of
widely
different
complexion
on
either
side
of
the
hearth





during
the
meal
which
was
presently
set
forth
and
proclaimed
ready
by
ren
the
talk
as
was
natural
in
that
watchful
attendants
presence
ran
only
on
general
topics
and
was
in
consequence
fitful
and
unspontaneous
but
when
the
two
men
for
all
their
difference
of
age
temper
and
pursuits
so
strongly
yet
so
oddly
united
in
sympathy
were
once
more
alone
they
naturally
fell
back
under
the
influence
of
the
more
engrossing
strain
of
reflection
again
there
was
silence
while
each
mused
gazing
into
space
and
vaguely
listening
to
the
plash
of
high
water
under
the
window
it
must
have
been
a
strong
motive
said
sir
adrian
after
his
dreamy
fashion
like
one
thinking
aloud
to
induce
a
man
like
you
to
abandon
his
honourable
name
captain
jack
flushed
at
these
words
drew
his
elbows
from
the
table
and
shot
a
keen
inquiring
glance
at
his
friend
which
however
fell
promptly
before
the
latters
unconscious
gaze
and
was
succeeded
by
one
of
reflective
melancholy
then
with
a
slight
sigh
he
raised
his
glass
to
the
lamp
and
while
peering
abstractedly
through
the
ruby
the
story
of
turning
my
back
upon
my
house
he
said
musingly
shaking
its
very
dust
off
my
feet
so
to
speak
and
starting
life
afresh
unbeholden
to
my
father
even
for
what
he
could
not
take
away
from
memy
own
nameis
a
simple
affair
although
pitiful
enough
perhaps
but
memories
of
family
wrongs
and
family
quarrels
are
of
their
nature
painful
and
as
i
am
a
mirthloving
fellow
i
hate
to
bring
them
upon
me
but
perhaps
it
has
occurred
to
you
that
i
may
have
brought
some
disgrace
upon
the
name
i
have
forsaken
i
never
allowed
myself
to
think
so
said
sir
adrian
surprised
your
very
presence
by
my
fireside
is
proof
of
it
again
the
captain
scrutinised
his
host
then
with
a
little
laugh
pardon
me
he
cried
with
another
man
one
might
accept
that
likely
proof
and
be
flattered
but
with
you
why
i
believe
i
know
you
too
well
not
to
feel
sure
that
you
would
have
received
me
as
kindly
and
unreservedly
no
matter
what
my
past
if
only
you
thought
that
i
had
repented
that
you
would
forgive
even
a
crime
regretted
and
having
forgiven
forget
but
to
resume
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
no
he
went
on
with
a
musing
air
but
i
could
tell
you
of
a
boy
disliked
at
home
for
his
stubborn
spirit
and
one
day
thrashed
thrashed
mercilesslyat
a
time
when
he
had
thought
he
had
reached
to
the
pride
of
mans
estate
thrashed
by
his
own
father
and
for
no
just
cause
oh
adrian
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
have
put
such
resentment
into
a
lads
heart
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
placed
himself
before
the
hearth
if
ever
i
have
sons
he
added
after
a
pause
and
at
the
words
his
whole
handsome
face
relaxed
and
became
suffused
with
a
tender
glow
i
would
rather
cut
my
right
hand
off
than
raise
such
a
spirit
in
them
well
i
daresay
you
can
guess
the
rest
i
will
even
tell
you
in
a
few
words
and
then
dismiss
the
subjecti
have
always
had
a
certain
shrewdness
at
the
bottom
of
my
recklessness
now
there
was
a
cousin
of
the
family
who
had
taken
to
commerce
in
liverpool
and
who
was
therefore
despised
ignored
and
insulted
by
us
gentry
of
the
shaws
so
when
i
packed
my
bundle
and
walked
out
of
the
park
gate
i
thought
of
him
and
two
days
later
i
presented
myself
at
his
mansion
in
rodney
street
liverpool
i
told
him
my
name
whereat
he
scowled
but
he
was
promptly
brought
round
upon
hearing
of
my
firm
determination
to
renounce
it
and
all
relations
with
my
fathers
house
for
ever
and
of
my
reasons
for
this
resolve
which
he
found
excellent
i
could
not
have
lighted
upon
a
better
man
he
hated
my
family
as
heartily
as
even
i
could
wish
and
readily
out
of
spite
to
them
undertook
to
aid
me
he
was
a
most
enterprising
scoundrel
had
a
share
in
half
a
dozen
floating
ventures
i
expressed
a
desire
for
life
on
the
ocean
wave
and
he
started
me
merrily
as
his
nephew
jack
smith
to
learn
the
business
on
a
slaver
of
his
the
ebony
trade
you
know
was
all
the
go
then
adrian
many
great
gentlemen
in
lancashire
had
shares
in
it
now
it
is
considered
low
to
say
true
a
year
of
it
was
more
than
enough
for
metoo
much
it
sickened
me
my
uncle
laughed
when
i
demurred
at
a
second
journey
but
to
humour
me
as
i
had
learned
something
of
the
sailing
trade
he
found
me
another
berth
on
board
a
privateer
the
st
nicholas
my
fortune
was
made
from
the
moment
i
set
foot
on
that
lucky
ship
as
you
know
and
you
have
never
seen
your
father
since
neither
father
nor
brothers
nor
any
of
my
kin
save
the
cousin
in
question
all
i
know
is
that
my
father
is
deadthat
he
disinherited
me
expressly
in
the
event
of
my
being
still
in
the
flesh
my
eldest
brother
reigns
many
of
us
are
scattered
god
knows
where
and
my
motherthe
sailors
voice
changed
slightlymy
mother
lives
in
her
own
house
with
some
of
the
younger
ones
so
much
i
have
ascertained
quite
recently
she
believes
me
dead
of
course
oh
it
will
be
a
good
day
adrian
when
i
can
come
back
to
her
independent
prosperous
bringing
my
beautiful
bride
with
me
but
until
i
can
resume
my
name
in
all
freedom
this
cannot
be
but
why
my
dear
fellow
these
further
risks
and
adventures
surely
even
at
your
showing
you
have
enough
of
this
worlds
goods
why
not
come
forward
now
at
once
openly
i
will
introduce
you
as
soon
as
may
be
in
your
real
character
for
the
sake
of
your
motherof
madeleine
herself
the
sailor
shook
his
head
tempted
yet
determined
i
am
not
free
to
do
so
i
have
given
my
word
my
honour
is
engaged
he
said
then
abruptly
asked
have
you
ever
heard
of
guinea
smuggling
guinea
smuggling
no
said
sir
adrian
his
amazement
giving
way
to
anxiety
no
you
surprise
me
you
who
are
or
were
i
understand
a
student
of
philosophical
matters
freedom
of
exchange
and
international
intercourse
and
the
rest
of
itthings
we
never
shall
have
so
long
as
governments
want
money
i
am
thinkinghowever
this
guinea
smuggling
is
a
comparatively
new
business
now
i
dont
know
anything
about
the
theory
but
i
know
this
much
of
the
practice
that
while
our
preventive
service
wont
let
guineas
pass
the
channel
as
goods
this
year
somebody
on
the
other
side
is
devilish
anxious
to
have
them
at
almost
any
cost
and
the
cost
you
know
is
heavy
for
the
risk
of
confiscation
is
great
well
your
banker
or
your
rich
man
will
not
trust
his
bullion
to
your
common
free
traderhe
is
not
quite
such
a
fool
no
put
in
sir
adrian
as
the
other
paused
on
this
mocking
proposition
in
the
old
days
when
i
was
busy
in
promoting
the
savenaye
expedition
i
came
across
many
of
that
gentry
and
i
cannot
mind
a
case
where
they
could
have
been
trusted
with
such
a
freight
but
perhaps
he
added
with
a
small
smile
the
standard
may
be
higher
now
captain
jack
grinned
appreciatively
that
is
where
the
likes
of
me
comes
in
i
will
confess
this
not
to
be
my
first
attempt
it
is
known
that
i
am
one
of
the
few
whose
word
is
warranty
what
is
more
as
i
have
said
it
is
known
that
i
have
the
luck
thus
even
if
i
could
bring
my
own
name
into
such
a
trade
i
would
not
it
would
be
the
height
of
folly
to
change
now
for
all
his
disapproval
sir
adrian
could
not
repress
a
look
of
amusement
i
verily
believe
jack
he
said
shaking
his
head
that
you
are
as
superstitious
yourself
as
the
best
of
them
i
ought
to
make
a
good
thing
out
of
it
said
jack
evasively
and
even
with
all
that
is
lovely
to
keep
me
on
shore
i
would
hardly
give
it
up
if
i
could
as
things
stand
i
could
not
if
i
would
do
not
condemn
me
adrianthat
would
be
fatal
to
my
hopesnay
i
actually
want
your
help
i
would
you
were
out
of
it
reiterated
sir
adrian
it
takes
so
little
to
turn
the
current
of
a
mans
life
when
he
seems
to
be
making
straight
for
happiness
as
to
the
morals
of
it
i
fail
i
must
admit
to
perceive
any
wrong
in
smuggling
at
least
in
the
abstract
except
that
a
certain
kind
of
moral
teaches
that
all
is
wrong
that
is
against
the
law
and
yet
so
many
of
our
laws
are
so
ferocious
and
inept
and
as
such
the
very
cause
of
so
much
going
wrong
that
might
otherwise
go
well
so
many
of
those
who
administer
them
are
themselves
so
ferocious
and
inept
that
the
mere
fact
of
a
pursuit
being
unlawful
is
no
real
condemnation
in
my
eyes
but
as
you
know
jack
those
who
place
themselves
above
some
laws
almost
invariably
renounce
all
if
you
are
hanged
for
stealing
a
horse
or
breaking
some
fiscal
law
and
hanged
for
killing
a
man
the
tendency
under
stress
of
circumstances
is
obvious
aye
have
we
not
a
proverb
about
it
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
for
a
lamb
there
are
gruesome
stories
about
your
free
tradersand
gruesome
endings
to
them
i
well
remember
in
my
young
days
the
clanking
gibbet
on
the
sands
near
preston
and
the
three
tarred
and
ironriveted
carcases
hanging
each
in
its
chains
with
the
perpetual
guard
of
carrion
crows
hanging
in
chains
is
still
on
the
statute
book
i
believe
but
ill
stop
my
croaking
now
you
are
not
one
to
be
drawn
into
brutal
ways
nor
one
i
fear
to
be
frightened
into
prudence
nevertheless
laughing
quietly
i
am
curious
to
know
in
what
way
you
expect
help
from
me
in
practice
do
you
seriously
want
me
to
embark
actually
on
a
smuggling
expeditioni
demur
my
dear
fellow
obviously
relieved
of
some
anxiety
the
other
burst
out
laughing
never
fear
i
know
your
dislike
to
bilge
water
too
well
i
appreciate
too
well
also
your
comfortable
surroundings
he
returned
seating
himself
once
more
complacently
in
his
armchair
much
as
i
should
love
your
company
on
board
my
pleasure
shipfor
if
you
please
the
peregrine
is
no
smuggling
lugger
but
professes
to
be
a
yacht
still
you
can
be
of
help
for
all
that
and
without
lifting
even
a
finger
to
promote
this
illicit
trade
you
may
ignore
it
completely
and
yet
you
will
render
me
incalculable
service
provided
you
do
not
debar
me
from
paying
you
a
few
more
visits
in
your
solitude
and
give
me
the
range
of
your
caves
and
cellars
you
are
welcome
enough
said
the
recluse
i
trust
it
may
end
as
well
as
it
promises
and
after
a
pause
madeleine
does
not
know
the
nature
of
your
present
pursuit
oddly
enough
and
happily
for
our
moments
of
interview
are
short
as
you
may
imagine
she
is
not
curious
on
the
subject
i
dont
know
what
notions
the
old
lady
maria
may
have
put
into
her
head
about
me
i
think
she
believes
that
i
am
engaged
on
some
secret
political
intrigue
and
approves
of
such
at
least
i
gathered
as
much
from
her
sympathetic
reticence
and
between
ourselves
i
am
beginning
to
believe
it
myself
how
is
that
asked
the
listener
moved
to
fresh
astonishment
by
this
new
departure
well
i
may
tell
you
who
not
only
can
be
as
silent
as
the
tomb
but
really
have
a
right
to
know
since
you
are
tacitly
of
the
conspiracy
this
time
the
transaction
is
to
be
with
some
official
of
the
french
court
they
want
the
metal
and
yet
wish
to
have
it
secretly
what
their
motive
may
be
is
food
for
reflection
if
you
like
but
it
is
no
business
of
mine
and
besides
the
fact
that
one
journey
will
suffice
for
a
sum
which
at
the
previous
rate
would
have
required
half
a
score
all
the
trouble
and
uncertainty
of
landing
are
disposed
of
at
any
rate
i
am
when
all
is
ready
to
be
met
by
a
government
vessel
get
my
quid
pro
quo
as
will
be
settled
and
there
the
matter
is
to
end
a
curious
expedition
mused
sir
adrian
yes
said
the
sailor
my
last
will
be
the
best
by
the
way
will
you
embark
a
few
bags
with
me
i
will
take
no
commission
sir
adrian
could
not
help
laughing
no
thank
you
i
have
no
wish
to
launch
any
more
of
my
patrimony
on
venturessince
it
would
be
of
no
service
to
you
i
had
almost
as
lief
you
had
made
use
of
my
old
crows
nest
without
letting
me
into
the
ins
and
outs
of
your
projects
but
be
it
as
it
may
it
is
yours
night
and
day
your
visits
i
shall
take
as
being
for
me
what
a
man
you
are
upon
my
soul
sir
adrian
cried
captain
jack
enthusiastically





later
on
when
the
shaking
down
hour
in
captain
jacks
phraseology
had
sounded
and
the
two
friends
separated
to
rest
the
young
man
refused
the
offer
dictated
by
hospitality
of
his
hosts
own
bedroom
sir
adrian
did
not
press
the
point
and
leaving
his
guest
at
liberty
to
enjoy
the
couch
arranged
by
ren
in
a
corner
under
the
bookshelves
even
as
when
mademoiselle
de
savenaye
had
been
the
guest
of
the
peel
himself
retired
to
that
now
hallowed
apartment
odd
fellow
that
soliloquised
captain
jack
as
slowly
divesting
himself
he
paced
about
the
long
room
and
in
the
midst
of
roseate
reflections
examined
his
curious
abode
withal
as
good
as
ever
stepped
it
was
a
fine
days
work
our
old
st
nicholas
did
about
this
time
eight
years
ago
rather
unlike
a
crowded
battery
deck
this
looking
from
the
solemn
books
to
the
glinting
organ
pipes
and
conscious
of
the
great
silence
as
for
me
i
should
go
crazy
by
myself
here
but
it
suits
him
queer
fish
again
ruminated
the
young
sailor
he
hates
no
one
and
yet
dislikes
almost
everybody
except
that
funny
little
frenchy
and
me
whereas
i
like
every
man
i
meetunless
i
detest
him
my
beautiful
plumage
this
whilst
carefully
folding
the
superfine
coat
and
thereon
the
endless
silken
stock
now
theres
a
fellow
who
does
not
care
a
hang
for
any
woman
under
the
sun
and
yet
enters
into
another
chaps
love
affairs
as
if
he
understood
it
all
i
believe
it
will
make
him
happy
to
win
my
cause
with
madeleine
i
wish
one
could
do
something
for
his
happiness
it
is
absurd
you
know
as
though
apostrophising
an
objector
a
man
cant
be
happy
without
a
woman
and
yet
again
my
good
jack
you
never
thought
that
before
you
met
madeleine
he
has
not
met
his
madeleine
thats
what
it
means
where
ignorance
is
bliss
friend
adrian
let
us
console
ourselves
and
call
you
ignorantly
happy
in
your
old
crows
nest
you
have
not
stocked
it
so
badly
eitherfor
all
your
ignorance
in
love
you
have
a
pretty
taste
in
liquor
so
thinking
he
poured
himself
a
last
glass
of
his
hosts
wine
which
he
held
for
a
moment
in
smiling
cogitation
looking
with
the
minds
eye
through
the
thick
walls
of
the
keep
across
the
cold
mistcovered
sands
of
scarthey
and
again
through
the
warm
and
scented
air
of
a
certain
room
imagination
pictured
where
madeleine
must
at
that
hour
lie
in
her
slumber
after
a
moment
of

guides
the
plot
tantys
wrath
upon
discovering
sir
adrians
departure
was
all
the
greater
because
she
could
extort
no
real
explanation
from
rupert
and
because
her
attacks
rebounded
as
it
were
from
the
polished
surface
he
exposed
to
them
on
every
side
madeleines
indifference
and
mollys
apparently
reckless
spirits
further
discomposed
her
during
supper
and
upon
the
latter
young
ladys
disappearance
after
the
meal
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
finish
her
nightly
game
of
patience
before
mounting
to
seek
her
with
the
purpose
of
relieving
her
overcharged
feelings
and
procuring
what
enlightenment
she
might
the
unwonted
spectacle
of
the
saucy
damsel
in
tears
made
miss
odonoghue
halt
upon
the
threshold
the
hot
wind
of
anger
upon
which
she
seemed
to
be
propelled
into
the
room
falling
into
sudden
nothingness
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
molly
was
weeping
so
energetically
indeed
with
such
a
passion
of
tears
and
sobs
that
the
noise
of
tantys
tumultuous
entrance
fell
unheeded
upon
her
ears
all
her
sympathies
stirred
within
her
the
old
lady
advanced
to
the
girl
with
the
intention
of
gathering
her
to
her
bosom
but
as
she
drew
near
the
black
and
white
of
the
open
diary
attracted
her
eye
under
the
circle
of
lamplight
and
being
possessed
of
excellent
long
sight
she
thought
it
no
shame
to
utilise
the
same
across
her
grandnieces
prostrate
heaving
form
before
making
known
her
presence
and
so
i
sit
and
cry
miss
molly
was
carrying
out
her
programme
with
much
precision
if
indeed
her
attitude
prone
along
the
table
could
be
described
as
sitting
miss
odonoghues
eyes
and
mouth
grew
round
as
with
the
expression
of
an
outraged
cockatoo
she
read
and
reread
the
telltale
phrases
here
was
a
complication
she
had
not
calculated
upon
dear
dear
she
cried
clacking
her
tongue
in
disconsolate
fashion
so
soon
as
she
could
get
her
breath
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
my
poor
girl
molly
leaped
to
her
feet
and
turning
a
blazing
disfigured
countenance
upon
her
relative
exclaimed
with
more
energy
than
politeness
good
gracious
aunt
what
do
you
want
then
catching
sight
of
the
open
diary
she
looked
suspiciously
from
it
to
her
visitor
and
closed
it
with
a
hasty
hand
but
miss
odonoghues
next
words
settled
the
doubt
well
to
be
sure
what
a
state
you
have
put
yourself
into
she
pursued
in
genuine
distress
what
has
happened
then
between
you
and
that
fellow
whom
i
declare
i
begin
to
believe
as
crazy
as
rupert
says
that
you
should
be
crying
your
eyes
out
over
his
going
back
to
his
islandyou
that
i
thought
could
not
shed
a
tear
if
you
tried
nothing
left
but
to
sit
and
cry
indeed
so
you
have
been
reading
my
diary
you
mean
thing
cried
miss
molly
stamping
her
foot
how
dare
you
come
creeping
in
here
spying
at
my
private
concerns
oh
oh
oh
with
unpremeditated
artfulness
relapsing
into
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
just
in
time
to
avert
the
volley
of
rebuke
with
which
the
hottempered
old
lady
was
about
to
greet
this
disrespectful
outburst
i
am
the
most
miserable
girl
in
all
the
world
i
wish
i
were
dead
i
do
again
tanty
opened
her
arms
and
this
time
she
did
draw
the
stormy
creature
to
a
bosom
as
warm
and
motherly
as
if
all
the
joys
of
womanhood
had
not
been
withheld
from
it
tell
me
all
about
it
my
poor
child
there
was
a
distinct
feeling
of
comfort
in
the
grasp
of
the
old
arms
comfort
in
the
very
ring
of
the
deep
voice
molly
was
not
a
secretive
person
by
nature
and
moreover
she
retained
quite
enough
shrewdness
even
in
her
unwonted
breakdown
to
conjecture
that
with
tanty
lay
her
sole
hope
of
help
so
rolling
her
dark
head
distractedly
on
the
old
maids
shoulder
the
young
maid
narrated
her
tale
of
woe
pressed
by
a
pointed
question
here
and
there
tanty
soon
collected
a
series
of
impressions
of
mollys
visit
to
scarthey
that
set
her
busy
mind
working
upon
a
startlingly
new
line
it
was
her
nature
to
jump
at
conclusions
and
it
was
not
strange
that
the
girls
passionate
display
of
grief
should
seem
to
be
the
unmistakable
outcome
of
tenderer
feelings
than
the
wounded
pride
and
disappointment
which
were
in
reality
its
sole
motors
i
am
convinced
it
is
rupert
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
cried
molly
at
last
springing
into
uprightness
again
and
clenching
her
hands
his
one
idea
is
to
drive
his
brother
permanently
from
his
own
homeand
he
hates
me
tanty
sat
rigid
with
thought
so
molly
was
in
love
with
sir
adrian
landale
and
hewho
knowswas
in
love
with
her
too
or
if
not
with
her
with
her
likeness
to
her
mother
and
that
was
much
the
same
thing
when
all
was
said
and
done
could
anything
be
more
suitable
more
fortunate
could
ever
two
birds
be
killed
with
one
stone
with
more
complete
felicity
than
in
this
settling
of
the
two
people
she
most
loved
upon
earth
poor
pretty
molly
the
old
ladys
heart
grew
very
tender
over
the
girl
who
now
stood
half
sullenly
half
bashfully
averting
her
swollen
face
five
days
ago
she
had
not
known
her
handsome
cousin
and
now
she
was
breaking
her
heart
for
him
it
might
be
indeed
as
she
said
that
they
had
to
thank
rupert
for
thisand
off
flew
tantys
mind
upon
another
tangent
rupert
was
very
deep
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
he
was
anxious
enough
to
keep
adrian
away
from
them
all
what
would
it
be
then
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
his
marriage
tanty
with
the
delightful
optimism
that
seventy
years
experience
had
failed
to
damp
here
became
confident
of
the
approach
of
her
younger
nephews
complete
discomfiture
and
in
the
cheering
contemplation
of
that
event
chuckled
so
unctuously
that
molly
looked
at
her
amazed
it
is
well
for
you
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
rising
and
wagging
her
head
with
an
air
of
enigmatic
resolution
that
you
have
got
an
aunt





some
two
days
later
ren
sitting
upon
a
ledge
of
the
old
scarthey
wall
in
the
spare
sunshine
which
this
still
winters
noon
shone
pearllike
through
a
universal
mist
busy
mending
a
net
to
the
tune
of
a
melancholy
inward
whistle
heard
up
above
the
licking
of
the
waves
all
around
him
and
the
whimper
of
the
seagulls
overhead
the
beat
of
steady
oars
approaching
from
land
side
starting
to
his
feet
the
little
man
in
vague
expectation
ran
to
a
point
of
vantage
from
which
to
scan
the
tideway
after
a
few
seconds
investigation
he
turned
tail
dashed
into
the
ruins
up
the
steps
and
burst
open
the
door
of
the
sittingroom
calling
upon
his
master
with
a
scared
expression
of
astonishment
captain
jack
poring
over
a
map
his
pipe
sticking
rakishly
out
of
one
side
of
his
mouth
looked
up
amused
at
the
frenchmans
evident
excitement
while
adrian
who
had
been
busy
with
the
uppermost
row
of
books
upon
his
west
wall
looked
down
from
his
ladder
perch
with
the
pessimists
constitutional
expectation
of
evil
growing
upon
his
face
one
comes
in
a
boat
ejaculated
ren
and
i
thought
i
ought
to
warn
his
honour
if
his
honour
will
give
himself
the
trouble
to
look
out
it
must
be
the
devil
to
frighten
renny
in
this
fashion
muttered
captain
jack
as
distinctly
as
the
clench
of
his
teeth
upon
the
pipe
would
allow
him
sir
adrian
paled
a
little
he
began
to
descend
his
ladder
mechanically
flicking
the
dust
from
his
cuffs
your
honour
said
ren
drawing
to
the
window
and
looking
out
cautiously
i
have
not
yet
seen
her
but
i
believe
it
is

of
your

jacks
pipe
fell
from
his
dropping
jaw
and
was
broken
into
many
fragments
as
he
leaped
to
his
feet
with
an
elasticity
of
limb
and
a
richness
of
expletive
which
of
themselves
would
have
betrayed
his
calling
flinging
his
arm
across
one
of
adrians
shoulders
he
peeped
across
the
other
out
of
the
window
with
an
alarm
half
mocking
half
genuine
the
devil
it
is

renny
he
cried
drawing
back
and
running
his
hands
with
an
exaggerated
gesture
of
despair
through
his
brown
curls
adrian
all
is
lost
unless
you
hide
me
my
aunt
here
and
alone
exclaimed
adrian
retreating
from
the
window
perturbed
enough
himself
i
must
go
down
to
meet
her
pray
god
it
is
no
ill
news
hurry
renny
clear
these
glasses
away
in
the
name
of
all
thats
sacred
clear
me
away
first
interposed
captain
jack
this
time
with
a
real
urgency
through
the
open
lattice
came
the
sound
of
the
grating
of
the
boats
keel
upon
the
sand
and
a
vigorous
hail
from
a
masculine
throatahoy
renny
potter
ahoy
adrian
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
my
hopes
hide
me
in
your
lowest
dungeon
for
goodness
sake
i
do
not
know
my
way
about
your
ruins
and
i
am
convinced
the
old
lady
will
nose
me
out
like
a
badger
there
was
no
time
for
explanation
sir
adrian
made
a
sign
to
ren
who
highly
enjoying
the
situation
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
was
already
volunteering
to
well
hide
mr
the
captain
and
the
pair
disappeared
with
much
celerity
into
the
inner
room
while
adrian
unable
to
afford
himself
further
preparation
hurried
down
the
great
stairs
to
meet
this
unexpected
guest
he
emerged
bareheaded
into
the
curious
mist
which
hung
palllike
upon
the
outer
world
and
seemed
to
combine
the
opposite
elements
of
glare
and
dulness
just
as
tanty
aided
by
the
stalwart
arm
of
the
boatman
who
had
rowed
her
across
succeeded
in
dragging
her
rheumatic
limbs
up
the
last
bit
of
ascent
to
the
door
of
the
keep
she
halted
disengaged
herself
and
puffing
and
blowing
surveyed
her
nephew
with
a
stony
gaze
my
dear
aunt
cried
adrian
nothing
has
happened
i
trust
sufficient
has
already
happened
nephew
i
should
hope
retorted
the
old
lady
with
extreme
dignity
sufficient
to
make
me
desire
to
confer
with
you
most
seriously
i
thank
you
young
man
turning
to
william
shearman
who
stood
on
one
side
his
eager
gaze
upon
the
master
ready
to
pull
his
forelock
so
soon
as
he
could
catch
his
eye
be
here
again
in
an
hour
if
you
please
but
you
will
allow
me
to
escort
you
myself
exclaimed
adrian
rising
to
the
situation
and
i
hope
there
need
be
no
hurry
so
long
as
daylight
lastsgoodmorning
will
i
am
glad
the
new
craft
is
a
successyou

my

i
beg
the
steps

steep
and
rough
gripping
her
nephews
arm
with
her
bony
old
womans
hand
miss
odonoghue
began
a
laborious
ascent
pausing
every
five
steps
to
breathe
stertorously
and
reproachfully
and
look
round
upon
the
sandstone
walls
with
supreme
disdain
but
this
was
nothing
to
the
air
with
which
when
at
last
installed
upon
a
high
hard
chair
in
the
sittingroom
having
sternly
refused
the
easy
one
sir
adrian
humbly
proffered
she
deliberately
proceeded
to
survey
the
scene
in
truth
the
neatness
that
usually
characterised
adrians
surroundings
was
conspicuously
absent
from
them
just
then
two
or
three
maps
lay
overlapping
each
other
upon
the
table
beside
the
tray
with
its
flagon
of
amber
ale
which
had
formed
the
captains
morning
draught
and
the
soiled
glass
the
fragments
of
his
pipe
and
its
halfburnt
contents
lay
strewn
about
the
prostrate
chair
which
that
lively
individual
had
upset
in
his
agitation
adrians

the
books
he
had
been
handling
and
had
not
replaced
the
white
ash
of
the
dying
fire
all
contributed
to
the
unwonted
aspect
of
somewhat
melancholy
disorder
worse
than
all
the
fumes
of
the
strong
tobacco
which
the
sailor
liked
to
smoke
in
his
secluded
moments
hung
rank
despite
the
open
window
upon
the
absolute
motionlessness
of
the
atmosphere
tanty
snorted
and
sniffed
while
adrian
after
picking
up
the
chair
began
to
almost
unconsciously
refold
the
maps
his
eyes
fixed
wonderingly
upon
his
visitors
face
this
latter
delivered
herself
at
length
of
some
of
the
indignation
that
was
choking
her
in
abrupt
disjointed
sentences
as
if
she
were
uncorking
so
many
bottles
well
im
sure
nephew
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
extraordinary
behaviour
and
if
this
is
the
style
you
prefer
to
live
instyle
did
i
saysty
would
be
more
appropriate
of
course
it
is
only
what
i
have
been
led
to
expect
but
i
must
say
i
was
ill
prepared
to
be
treated
by
you
with
actual
disrespect
my
sisters
child
and
i
your
guest
not
to
speak
of
your
aunt
and
you
your
mothers
son
and
her
host
besides
it
is
a
slap
in
the
face
adrian
a
slap
in
the
face
which
has
been
a
very
bitter
pill
to
have
to
swallow
i
assure
youi
may
say
without
exaggeration
in
fact
that
it
has
cut
me
to
the
quick
but
surely
cried
the
nephew
laughing
with
gentle
indulgence
at
this
complicated
indictment
surely
you
cannot
suppose
i
would
have
been
willingly
guilty
of
the
smallest
disrespect
to
you
i
am
a
most
unfortunate
man
most
unfortunately
situated
and
if
i
have
offended
it
is
you
must
believe
unwittingly
and
unavoidably
but
you
got
my
letteri
made
my
motives
clear
to
you
oh
yes
i
got
your
letter
yesterday
responded
tanty
not
at
all
softened
and
a
more
idiotic
production
from
a
man
of
your
attainments
allow
me
to
remark
i
never
read
adrian
you
are
making
a
perfect
fool
of
yourself
and
you
cannot
afford
it
i
fear
you
will
never
really
understand
my
position
murmured
adrian
hopelessly
tanty
rattled
her
large
green
umbrella
upon
the
floor
with
a
violence
that
made
her
nephew
start
then
turned
upon
him
a
countenance
inflamed
with
righteous
anger
it
is
only
three
days
ago
since
i
gave
you
fully
my
view
of
the
situation
she
remarked
you
were
good
enough
at
the
time
to
admit
that
it
was
a
remarkably
wellbalanced
one
i
should
be
glad
if
you
will
explain
in
what
manner
your
position
could
have
changed
in
the
space
of
just
three
hours
after
to
lead
you
to
rush
back
to
your
island
really
as
if
you
were
a
mole
or
a
wild
indian
or
some
other
strange
animal
that
could
not
bear
civilised
society
without
even
so
much
as
a
goodbye

statements
that

not
a

of

in
them
that
do
not
hold
water
for
an

you

you

not

in
the

away

heartless

what

breaking

muttered
adrian
again
rose
up
stiffly
in
a
sort
of
horrified
astonishment
and
then
sat
down
again
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
like
a
man
striving
to
awaken
from
a
painful
dream
oh
adrian
dont
be
more
of
a
fool
than
you
can
possibly
help
cried
his
relative
exasperated
beyond
all
expression
by
his
inarticulate
distress
you
are
so
busy
contemplating
all
sorts
of
absurdities
miles
away
that
i
verily
believe
you
cannot
see
an
inch
beyond
your
nose
my
gracious
what
is
there
to
be
so
astonished
at
how
did
you
behave
to
the
poor
innocent
from
the
very
instant
she
crossed
your
threshold
fact
is
you
have
been
a
regular
gay
lothario

tanty
starting
again
upon
her
fine
vein
of
metaphordid
you
not
deliberately
hold
the
cup
of
love
to
those
young
lips
only
to
nip
it
in
the
bud
the
girl
is
not
a
stock
or
a
stone
you
are
a
handsome

and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is

who
play
with
fire
must
reap
as
they
have
sown
tanty
who
had
been
holding
forth
with
the
rapidity
of
a
loose
windmill
in
a
hurricane
here
found
herself
forced
to
pause
and
take
breath
which
she
did
fanning
herself
with
much
energy
a
triumphant
consciousness
of
the
unimpeachability
of
her
logic
written
upon
her
heated
countenance
but
adrian
still
stared
at
her
with
the
same
incredulous
dismay
looking
indeed
as
little
like
a
gay
lothario
as
it
was
possible
even
for
him
do
you
mean
he
said
at
last
in
slow
broken
sentences
as
his
mind
wrestled
with
the
strange
tidings

that
molly

bright
beautiful
creature

oh
my

tanty
striving
with
a
laugh
the
idea
is
too
absurd
i
am
old
enough
to
be
her
father
you
knowwhat
evidence
can
you
have
for
a
statement
so
distressing
so
extraordinary
i
am
not
quite
in
my

neither

over

cruelty

he
paused
and
a
deep
flush
overspread
his
face
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
except
indeed
in
the
first
moment
of
her
arrivalwhen
she
came
in
upon
me
as
i
was
lost
in
memories
of
the
pastlike
the
spirit
of
ccile
humph
said
tanty
pointedly
but
then
you
see
what
you
took
for
cciles
spirit
happened
to
be
molly
in
the
flesh
she
fixed
her
sharp
eyes
upon
her
nephew
who
struck
into
confusion
by
her
words
seemed
for
the
moment
unable
to
answer
then
as
if
satisfied
with
the
impression
produced
she
folded
her
hands
over
the
umbrella
handle
and
observed
in
more
placid
tones
than
she
had
yet
used
and
now
we
must
see
what
is
to
be
done
adrian
began
to
pace
the
room
in
greater
perturbation
what
is
to
be
done
he
repeated
alas
what
can
be
done
tanty
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
should
have
cut
off
my
right
hand
rather
than
brought
this
thing
upon
the
childbut
she
is
very
youngthe
impression
thank
heaven
cannot
in
the
nature
of
things
endure
she
will
meet
some
one
worthy
of
herwith
you
tanty
kindest
of
hearts
i
can
safely
trust
her
future
but
that
she
should
suffer
now
and
through
me
that
bright
creature
who
flitted
in
upon
my
dark
life
like
some
heavensent
messengerthese
are
evil
tidings
tanty
you
must
take
her
away
you
must
distract
her
mind
you
must
tell
her
what
a
poor
brokendown
being
i
am
how
little
worthy
of
her
sweet
thoughts
and
she
will
learn
soon
learn
to
forget
me
to
laugh
at
herself
although
addressing
the
old
lady
he
spoke
like
a
man
reasoning
with
himself
and
the
words
dropped
from
his
lips
as
if
drawn
from
a
very
well
of
bitterness
tanty
listened
to
him
in
silence
but
the
tension
of
her
whole
frame
betrayed
that
she
was
only
gathering
her
forces
for
another
explosion
when
adrians
voice
ceased
there
was
a
moments
silence
and
then
the
storm
burst
whisking
herself
out
of
her
chair
the
umbrella
came
into
play
once
more
but
though
it
was
only
to
thump
the
table
it
was
evident
miss
odonoghue
would
more
willingly
have
laid
it
about
the
delinquents
shoulders
adrian
are
you
a
man
at
all
she
ejaculated
fiercely
then
with
sudden
deadly
composure
so
this
is
the
reparation
you
propose
to
make
for
the
mischief
you
have
wrought
in
gods
name
cried
he
goaded
at
length
into
some
sort
of
despairing
anger
himself
what
would
you
have
me
do
the
answer
came
with
the
promptitude
of
a
return
shot
do
why
marry
her
of
course
marry
her
there
was
a
breathless
pause
tanty
leaning
forward
across
the
table
crimson
agitated
yet
triumphant
adrians
white
face
blasted
with
astonishment

he
echoed
at
length
once
more
in
a
whisper
this
time
then
with
a
groan
this
is
madness

caught
him
up
briskly

in

the
patience

why
i
dont
believe
there
is
another
man
on
earth
that
would
not
be
wild
with
joy
at
the
mere
thought
of
having
gained
such
a
prize
a
beautiful
creature
with
a
heart
of
gold
and
a
purse
of
gold
to
boot
oh
heavens
aunt
interrupted
the
man
passionately
leave
that
question
out
of
the
reckoning
the
one
thing
the
only
thing
to
consider
is
her
happiness
you
cannot
make
me
believe
it
can
be
for
her
happiness
that
she
should
marry
such
as
me
and
why
shouldnt
it
be
for
her
happiness
answered
the
dauntless
old
lady
was
not
she
happy
enough
with
you
here
in
this
godforsaken
hole
with
nothing
but
the
tempest
besides
for
company
why
should
not
she
be
happy
then
when
you
come
back
to
your
own
good
place
would
not
you
be
kind

not

why
adrian
cried
tanty
charmed
at
this
unexpected
disclosure
of
feeling
and
the
accent
with
which
it
was
delivered
i
declare
you
are
as
much
in
love
with
the
girl
as
she
is
with
you
why
now
you
shall
just
come
back
with
me
to
pulwick
this
moment
and
she
shall
tell
you
herself
if
she
can
find
happiness
with
you
or
not
ohi
will
hear

as
a
man
of
honour
all
point
my
dear
nephew
in
the
same
direction
and
if
you
neglect
this
warning
voice
you
will
be
blind
indeed
to
the
call
of
duty
come
now
come
back
to
your
home
where
the
sweetest
wife
ever
a
man
had
awaits
you
and
when
i
shall
see
the
children
spring
up
around
you
adrian
then
god
will
have
granted
my
last

silence
had
reigned
for
but
a
few
seconds
in
the
great
room
of
the

when
captain

bearing
on
his

an
expression
at
once
boyishly
jubilant
and
mockingly
astonished
he
planted
himself
in

a

opinion
a
rarely

characteristic
of
very
warmhearted

is
their
inability

to
lead

than

fell
promptly
into
his
original
state
of
disgrace
during
the
drive
from

up

indictment
with
a
shrewd
but
he
could
not

upon
me
which
indeed

very
tales

suspected

too
well
would
have
proved
had
it
not
been
for
the
new
unforeseen
motive
that
the
mornings
revelation
had
brought
does
molly
know
of
your
visit
to
me
he
asked
as
the
carriage
halted
before
the
gate
and
the
enormous
redheaded
cumbrian
gatekeeper
with
his
rosy
moggie
proudly
swung
it
open
to
stand
on
either
side
the
one
bowing
with
jubilant
greeting
and
the
other
curtseying
with
bashful
smiles
at
the
real
master

expect

visit

into
gravity

have
told
no
one
of
my
purpose
this
day
rupert
walked
off
to
the
stables
immediately
after
breakfastgoing
ahunting
he
said
he
was
and
offered
to
bear
the
girls
to
the
meet
and
then
feeling
lonely
without
his
company
added
tanty
with
a
wink
i
ordered
the
carriage
and
thought
i
would
go
and
have
a
peep
at
the
place
where
poor
molly
was
drowned
just
for
a
little
diversion
whether
the
little
rogue
expects
you
or
not
after
your
note
of
the
other
day
i
am
sure
i
could
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
she
sits
watching
that
crazy
old
tower
of
yours
by
day
and
your
light
by
night
well
well
i
must
not
tell
tales
out
of
school
you
may
find
out
for
yourself
but
mind
you
adrian
she
impressed
on
him
sagely
it
is
not
i
who
bring
you
back
you
return
of
your
own

the

would
murder
me
if
she
knewwith
that
proud
heart
of
hers
my
dear
tanty
trust
me
this
incomprehensible
discovery
of
yours
which
i
cannot
yet
believe
in
really
is
so
far
as
my
discretion
is
concerned
as
if
i
had
never
heard
of
it
heavens
i
have
been
a
blundering
fool
but
i
could
not
insult
her
with
a
hint
of
it
for
the
world
i
have
come
to
see
rupert
today
as
usual
of
courseand
as
you
say

i
shall
see
for
myself
you
have
opened
my
eyes
miss
odonoghue
looked
at
her
nephew
with
admiration

even
a
doleful
sir
adrian
faith
here
we
are
this
has
been
a
pleasant
ride
but
my
old
bones
are
so
tired
and
you
and
yours
have
set
them
jogging
so
much
of
late
that
i
think
ill
never
want
to
stir
a
foot
again
once
i
get
back
to
bunratty

except
indeed
to
come
and
be
godmother
to
the
heir
having
lent
a
dutiful
arm
up
the
stairs
to
his
now
beaming
relative
sir
adrian
came
down
pensively
and
entered
the
library
there
booted
and
spurred
but
quietly
installed
at
a
writing
table
sat
mr
landale
who
rose
in
his
nonchalant
manner
and
with
cold
looks
met
his
brother
there
was
no
greeting
between
them
but
simply
thus
i
understood
from
aunt
rose
you
were
out
hunting
such
was
my
intention
but
when
i
found
out
that
she
had
gone
to
see
youdont
look
so
astonished
adriana
man
must
know
what
is
going
on
in
his
householdi
suspected
you
would
escort
her
back
so
i
desisted
and
waited
for
you
it
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
to
see
you
for
i
thought
we
had
sufficiently
discussed
all
business
recently
but
doubtless
you
will
profit
of
the
opportunity
to
go
into
a
few
matters
which
want
your
attention
do
you
mean
to
remain
speaking
these
words
in
a
detached
manner
mr
landale
kept
a
keenly
observant
look
upon
his
brothers
countenance
in
a
most
unwonted
way
the
tone
and
the
look
irritated
sir
adrian
i
came
back
rupert
because
there
were
some
things
i
wished
to
see
for
myself
here
he
answered
frigidly
and
going
to
the
bell
rang
it
vigorously
on
the
servants
appearance
without
reference
to
his
brother
he
himself
and
very
shortly
gave
orders
i
shall
dine
here
today
have
the
tapestryroom
made
ready
for
me
then
turning
to
rupert
whose
face
betrayed
some
of
the
astonishment
aroused
by
this
most
unusual
assumption
of
authority
and
resuming
as
it
were
the
thread
of
his
speech
he
went
on
no
rupert
i
have
no
desire
to
talk
business
with
you
it
is
a
pity
you
should
have
given
up
your
day
is
it
yet
too
late
upon
my
word
adrian
said
mr
landale
clenching
his
hand
nervously
round
his
fine
cambric
handkerchief
there
must
be
something
of
importance
in
the
wind
to
have
altered
your
bearing
towards
me
to
this
extent
i
have
no
wish
to
interfere
i
came
back
and
gave
up
good
company
for
the
reason
i
have
stated
i
will
now
only
point
out
that
with
your
sudden
whims
you
render
my
position
excessively
false
in
a
house
where
at
your
own
wish
i
am
ostensibly
established
as
master
and
without
waiting
for
another
word
the
younger
brother
having
shot
the
arrow
which
hitherto
never
failed
to
reach
the
bullseye
of
the
situation
left
the
room
with
much
dignity
once
more
alone
sir
adrian
standing
motionless
in
the
great
room
darkened
yet
more
in
the
winter
light
by
the
heavy
festoons
of
curtains
that
hung
over
the
numerous
empty
bookshelves
the
souls
of
which
had
migrated
to
the
peel
to
keep
the
master
company
cogitated
upon
this
first
unpleasant
step
in
his
new
departure
and
wondered
within
himself
why
he
had
felt
so
extraordinarily
moved
by
anger
today
at
the
cold
inquisitiveness
of
his
brother
no
doubt
the
sense
of
being
watched
thus
held
away
at
armslength
as
it
were
was
cause
sufficient
and
yet
that
was
not
it
ingratitude
alone
even
to
enmity
in
return
for
benefits
forgot
could
not
rouse
this
bitterness
but
had
it
not
been
for
tantys
interference
he
would
be
now
exiled
from
his
home
until
the
departure
of
cciles
child
just
as
but
for
chance
he
would
have
been
kept
in
actual
ignorance
of
her
arrival
it
was
his
brothers
doing
that
he
had
blindly
withdrawn
himself
when
his
presence
would
have
caused
happiness
to
her
yes
that
was
it
rupert
had
a
scheme
that
was
what
dwelt
in
his
eyesa
scheme
which
would
bring
indeed
did
bring
unhappiness
to
that
dear
guest
no
wonder
now
that
the
unconscious
realisation
of
it
awoke
all
the
mans
blood
in
him
no
rupert
sir
adrian
found
himself
saying
aloud
i
let
you
reign
at
pulwick
so
long
as
you
crossed
not
one
jot
of
such
pleasure
and
happiness
that
might
belong
to
cciles
child
but
here
our
wills
clash
and
now
since
there
cannot
be
two
masters
in
a
house
as
you
say
i
am
the
master
here





as
sir
adrians
mind
was
seething
in
this
unusual
mood
miss
odonoghue
entering
her
nieces
room
found
molly
perched
in
riding
dress
on
the
windowsill
looking
forth
upon
the
outer
world
with
dissatisfied
countenance
mr
landale
had
sent
word
at
the
last
moment
that
to
his
intense
regret
he
could
not
escort
the
ladies
to
the
meet
some
important
business
having
retained
him
at
pulwick
so
much
did
miss
molly
pettishly
explain
in
answer
to
the
affectionate
inquiry
concerning
the
cloud
on
her
brow
slashing
her
whip
the
while
and
pouting
and
generally
out
of
harmony
with
the
special
radiance
of
the
old
ladys
eye
and
the
more
than
usual
expansiveness
of
the
embrace
which
was
bestowed
upon
her
tut
tut
tut
now
observed
the
artful
person
in
tones
of
deep
commiseration
ah
well
ruperts
a
poor
creature
which
ever
side
he
turns
up
will
you
go
now
my
child
and
fetch
me
the
letters
i
left
on
the
drawingroom
table
isnt
it
like
me
to
spend
half
the
morning
writing
them
and
leave
them
down
there
after
all
molly
rose
unwillingly
threw
her
whip
on
the
bed
her
hat
on
the
floor
and
mistily
concerned
over
tantys
air
of
irrepressible
and
pleasurable
excitement
walked
out
of
the
room
bestowing
as
she
passed
her
long
pier
glass
a
moody
glance
at
her
own
glowering
beauty
whats
the
use
of
you
she
muttered
to
herself
anybody
can
fetch
and
carry
for
old
aunts
and
look
out
of
windows
on
leafless
trees
the
way
to
the
drawingroom
was
through
the
library
as
molly
immersed
in
her
reflections
passed
along
this
room
she
stopped
with
a
violent
start
on
perceiving
the
figure
of
sir
adrian
a
tall
silhouette
against
the
cold
light
of
the
window
as
she
came
upon
him
her
face
was
fully
illumined
and
there
was
a
glorious
taletelling
in
the
widening
of
her
eyes
and
the
warm
flush
that
mounted
to
her
cheek
that
on
the
instant
scattered
in
the
mans
mind
all
wondering
doubts
a
rush
of
tenderness
filled
him
at
one
sweep
head
and
heart
to
the
core
molly
he
cried
panting
and
then
with
halting
voice
as
she
advanced
a
pace
and
stood
with
mouth
parted
and
brilliant
expectant
eyes
you
took
away
all
light
and
warmth
with
you
when
you
left
my
lonely
dwelling
i
tried
to
take
up
my
life
there
but
but
you
have
come
backfor
me
and
drawn
by
his
extended
hands
she
advanced
her
burning
gaze
fixed
upon
his
i
dared
not
think
of
seeing
you
again
he
murmured
clasping
her
hands
yet
my
return

pleases
you
yes
thus
was
crowned
this
strange
wooing
was
clenched
a
lifes
union
based
upon
either
side
on
fascinating
unrealities
she
was
drawn
into
his
arms
and
against
his
heart
she
lay
shaking
with
little
shivers
of
delight
looking
into
the
noble
face
bent
so
lovingly
over
hers
her
mind
floating
between
unconscious
exultation
and
languorous
joy
for
a
long
while
without
a
word
he
held
her
thus
on
his
strong
arm
gazing
with
a
rending
conflict
of
rapture
and
anguish
on
the
beautiful
image
of
his
lifes
love
until
his
eyes
were
dimmed
with
rising
tears
then
he
slowly
stooped
over
the
upturned
face
and
as
she
dropped
her
lids
with
a
faint
smile
kissed
her
lips
there
came
a
warning
rattle
at
the
door
handle
and
molly
disengaging
herself
softly
from
her
betrotheds
embrace
but
still
retaining
his
arm
turned
to
witness
the
entrance
of
miss
odonoghue
and
mr
landale
on
the
formers
face
under
a
feigned
expression
of
surprise
now
expanded
itself
in
effulgence
the
plenitude
of
that
satisfaction
which
had
been
dawning
there
ever
since
her
return
from
the
island
rupert
held
himself
well
in
hand
he
halted
it
is
true
for
an
instant
at
the
first
sight
of
sir
adrian
and
molly
and
put
his
handkerchief
furtively
to
his
forehead
to
wipe
the
sudden
cold
sweat
which
broke
out
upon
it
but
the
hesitation
was
so
momentary
as
to
pass
unperceived
and
if
his
countenance
as
he
advanced
again
bore
an
expression
of
disapproval
it
was
at
once
dignified
and
restrained
so
you
are
there
molly
exclaimed
the
old
lady
with
inimitable
airiness
just
imagine
my
dear
i
had
those
letters
in
my
pocket
all
the
while
after
all
you
did
not
find
them
did
you
but
adrian
still
retaining
the
little
hand
on
his
arm
came
forward
slowly
and
broke
through
the
incipient
flow
aunt
rose
said
he
in
a
voice
still
veiled
by
emotion
i
know
your
kind
heart
will
rejoice
with
me
although
you
may
not
be
so
surprised
as
no
doubt
rupert
will
be
at
the
news
we
have
for
you
molly
and
i
you
are
right
adrian
interrupted
rupert
gravely
to
any
who
know
your
life
and
your
past
as
i
do
the
news
you
seem
to
have
for
us
must
seem
strange
indeed
so
strange
that
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
withhold
congratulations
for
if
i
mistake
not
he
added
with
a
delicately
shaded
change
of
tone
to
sympathetic
courtesy
and
slightly
turning
his
handsome
face
towards
molly
i
assume
that
my
fair
cousin
de
savenaye
has
even
but
now
promised
to
be
my
sister
lady
landale
sir
adrian
who
softened
by
the
emotion
of
this
wonderful
hour
had
made
a
movement
to
grasp
his
brothers
hand
but
had
checked
himself
with
a
passionate
movement
of
anger
instantly
restrained
as
the
overt
impertinence
of
the
first
words
fell
on
his
ears
here
looked
with
a
shadowing
anxiety
at
the
girls
face
but
molly
who
could
never
withhold
the
lash
of
her
tongue
when
rupert
gave
the
slightest
opening
immediately
acknowledged
her
enemys
courtly
bow
with
sauciness
what
no
congratulations
from
the
model
brother
not
even
a
word
of
thanks
to
molly
de
savenaye
for
bringing
the
truant
to
his
home
at
last
but
you
malign
yourself
my
dear
rupert
i
believe
tis
but
excess
of
joy
that
ties
your
tongue
with
gleaming
smile
mr
landale
would
have
opposed
this
direct
thrust
by
some
parry
of
polished
insult
but
he
met
his
elders
commanding
glance
remembered
his
parting
words
on
two
previous
occasions
and
wisely
abstained
contenting
himself
with
another
slight
bow
and
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
the
shoulders
at
the
same
time
miss
odonoghue
with
an
odd
mixture
of
farcically
pretended
astonishment
and
genuine
triumph
fell
on
the
girls
neck
it
is
possible
soul
of
my
heart
my
sweet
childi
cant
believe
itthough
i
vow
i
knew
it
all
along
so
i
am
to
see
my
two
favourites
made
one
by
holy
matrimony
punctuating
her
exclamation
with
kisses
on
the
fair
young
face
and
wildly
seeking
in
space
with
her
driedup
old
fingers
to
meet
adrians
hand
i
the
one
barren
stock
of
the
odonoghues
shall
see
my
sisters
children
reunited
ah
adrian
what
a
beautiful
coat
this
will
make
for
you
to
hand
to
your
children
odonoghue
landale
kermelgan
savenayeeighteen
quarters
with
this
heiress
alone
adrian
child
for
the
descendants
of
landale
of
pulwick
and
miss
odonoghue
overcome
by
this
culminating
vision
of
happiness
and
perfection
fairly
burst
into
tears
in
the
midst
of
this
scene
mr
landale
after
listening
mockingly
for
a
few
instants
retired
with
ostentatious
discretion
later
in
the
day
as
madeleine
bent
her
pretty
ears
dutifully
yet
with
wandering
attention
to
mollys
gay
prognostications
concerning
pulwick
under
her
sway
whilst
the
servants
in
the
hall
pantry
and
kitchen
discussed
the
great
news
which
by
some
incomprehensible
agency
spread
with
torrentlike
swiftness
through
the
whole
estate
while
miss
odonoghue
was
feverishly
busy
with
the
correspondence
which
was
to
disseminate
far
and
wide
the
worlds
knowledge
of
the
happy
betrothal
sir
adrian
met
his
brother
walking
meditatively
along
the
winding
path
of
the
garden
flicking
with
the
loop
of
his
crop
the
border
of
evergreens
as
he
went
from
their
room
molly
and
madeleine
ensconced
in
the
deep
windowseat
could
see
the
meeting
how
i
should
like
to
hear
said
molly
i
know
this
supple
wretch
will
be
full
of
adrians
folly
in
marrying
mefirst
because
from
the
rupertian
point
of
view
it
is
a
disastrous
thing
that
his
elder
should
marry
at
all
and
secondly
because
molly
mistress
at
pulwick
priory
means
a
very
queer
position
indeed
for
mr
rupert
landale
how
i
wish
my
spirit
could
fly
into
adrians
head
just
for
a
moment
adrian
is
too
indulgent
it
requires
a
molly
to
deal
with
such
impertinence
indeed
you
are
unjust
with
our
cousin
said
madeleine
gently
why
this
hatred
i
cannot
understand
no
of
course
not
madeleine
rupert
is
charmingwith
you
i
am
not
blind
but
take
care
he
does
not
find
out
your
secret
miss
oh
i
dont
ask
you
any
more
about
it
but
if
he
ever
doesgare
ma
chre
but
at
the
present
juncture
mollys
estimate
of
sir
adrians
mood
was
mistaken
his
love
of
peace
which
amounted
to
a
wellknown
weakness
where
he
alone
was
concerned
weighed
not
a
feather
in
the
balance
when
such
an
interest
as
that
now
engaged
was
at
stake
as
a
matter
of
fact
rupert
landale
was
to
be
taken
by
surprise
again
that
day
and
again
not
pleasantly
on
noticing
his
brothers
approach
he
stopped
his
angry
flickings
and
slowly
moved
to
meet
him
at
first
they
walked
side
by
side
in
silence
presently
sir
adrian
began
rupert
he
said
gravely
after
our
first
interview
today
it
was
my
intention
to
have
begged
your
pardon
for
a
certain
roughness
in
my
manner
which
i
should
have
controlled
and
which
you
resented
i
would
have
done
so
had
you
allowed
me
at
that
moment
when
i
announced
my
forthcoming
marriage
and
my
heart
was
full
of
goodwill
to
all
especially
to
you
now
on
the
contrary
to
reestablish
at
least
that
outward
harmony
without
which
life
in
common
would
be
impossible
i
expect
from
you
some
expression
of
regret
for
your
behaviour
the
first
part
of
his
brothers
say
was
so
well
in
accordance
with
his
more
habitual
mood
that
mr
landale
had
already
sketched
his
equally
habitual
deprecating
smile
but
the
conclusion
changed
the
entire
standpoint
of
their
relations
an
expression
of
regretfrom
me
cried
he
exaggerating
his
astonishment
almost
to
mockery
from
any
one
but
my
brother
said
adrian
with
a
slight
but
perceptible
hardening
in
his
tone
i
should
say
an
apology
for
an
impertinence
mr
landale
now
genuinely
taken
aback
turned
a
little
pale
and
halted
abruptly
adrian
adrian
he
retorted
quickly
this
is
one
of
your
mad
moments
i
do
not
understand
no
brother
i
am
not
mad
and
never
have
been
dearly
as
you
would
wish
me
to
be
so
in
realitysince
death
would
have
none
of
me
but
though
you
know
this
yourself
but
too
well
you
have
never
understood
me
really
now
listenonce
for
all
try
and
see
our
positions
as
they
are
perhaps
then
matters
will
go
more
pleasantly
in
the
future
for
you
as
well
as
for
me
mr
landale
looked
keenly
at
the
speakers
face
for
a
second
and
then
without
a
word
resumed
his
walk
while
sir
adrian
by
his
side
pursued
with
quiet
emphasis
when
i
returned
from
the
other
world
so
to
speak
at
least
from
your
point
of
view
one
which
i
fully
understood
i
found
that
this
very
return
was
nothing
short
of
a
calamity
for
all
that
remained
of
my
kin
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
reduce
that
misfortune
to
a
great
extent
you
loved
the
positionthat
worldly
estimation
that
fortune
all
those
circumstances
which
with
perfect
moral
right
you
had
hitherto
enjoyed
they
presented
little
attraction
to
me
moreover
there
were
many
reasons
which
i
am
quite
aware
you
know
that
made
this
very
house
of
mine
a
dismal
dwelling
for
me
you
see
i
have
no
wish
to
give
too
generous
a
colour
to
my
motives
too
selfdenying
a
character
to
the
benefits
i
conferred
upon
you
but
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
they
were
benefits
for
them
i
received
no
gratitude
but
as
i
did
not
expect
gratitude
it
matters
little
i
might
however
have
expected
at
least
that
you
should
be
neutral
not
directly
hostile
to
mepray
let
me
finish
in
anticipation
of
a
rising
interruption
from
his
companion
i
shall
soon
have
done
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
not
merely
recriminating
hostile
you
have
been
and
are
now
so
long
as
the
position
you
assumed
towards
me
only
bore
on
our
own
relations
i
acquiesced
you
had
so
much
more
to
lose
than
i
could
gain
by
resenting
your
hidden
antagonism
i
held
you
so
to
speak
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
i
could
afford
to
pass
over
it
all
moreover
i
had
chosen
my
own
path
which
was
nothing
if
not
peaceful
i
say
you
always
were
hostile
to
me
you
have
been
so
more
than
ever
since
the
arrival
of
ccile
de
savenayes
children
you
were
however
grievously
mistaken
if
you
thoughti
verily
believe
you
didthat
i
did
not
realise
the
true
motives
that
prompted
you
to
keep
me
away
from
themi
loved
them
as
their
mothers
children
i
love
molly
with
a
sort
of
love
i
myself
do
not
understand
but
deep
enough
for
all
its
strangeness
yet
i
submitted
to
your
reasoning
to
your
plausible
representations
of
the
disastrous
effects
of
my
presence
i
went
back
to
my
solitude
because
it
never
entered
my
mind
that
it
could
be
in
my
power
to
help
their
happiness
you
indeed
had
actually
persuaded
me
of
the
contrary
as
you
know
and
i
myself
thought
it
better
to
break
the
unfortunate
spell
that
was
cast
on
me
unfortunate
i
thought
it
but
it
has
proved
far
otherwise
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
alley
and
as
they
turned
back
facing
each
other
for
a
moment
sir
adrian
noticed
the
evil
smile
playing
upon
his
brothers
lips
it
has
proved
otherwise
he
repeated
how
i
came
to
change
my
views
i
daresay
you
have
guessed
for
you
have
of
late
kept
a
good
watch
on
your
mad
brother
rupert
at
any
rate
you
know
what
has
come
to
pass
now
i
desire
you
to
understand
this
clearlyinterference
with
me
as
matters
stand
means
interference
with
molly
and
as
such
i
must
and
shall
resent
it
well
adrian
and
what
have
i
done
now
was
mr
landales
quiet
reply
he
turned
a
gravely
attentive
innocently
injured
countenance
to
the
paling
light
when
i
said
you
did
not
understand
me
returned
sir
adrian
with
undiminished
firmness
when
i
said
you
owed
me
some
expression
of
regret
it
was
to
warn
you
never
again
to
assume
the
tone
of
insinuation
and
sarcasm
to
me
which
you
permitted
yourself
today
in
the
presence
of
molly
you
could
not
restrain
this
long
habit
of
censuring
of
unwarrantable
and
impertinent
criticism
of
your
elder
and
when
you
referred
to
my
past
molly
could
not
but
be
offended
by
the
mockery
of
your
tones
moreover
you
took
upon
yourself
if
i
have
heard
aright
to
disapprove
openly
of
our
marriage
upon
what
ground
that
would
bear
announcing
i
know
not
but
let
this
be
enough
try
and
realise
that
our
respective
positions
are
totally
changed
by
this
unforeseen
event
and
that
as
molly
is
now
to
be
mistress
at
pulwick
i
must
of
course
revoke
my
tacit
abdication
nevertheless
if
you
think
you
can
put
up
with
the
new
state
of
things
there
need
be
little
alteration
in
your
present
mode
of
life
my
dear
rupert
if
you
will
only
make
a
generous
effort
to
alter
your
line
of
conduct
and
here
sir
adrian
succumbing
for
a
moment
to
the
fault
so
common
to
kindly
minds
of
discounting
the
virtue
of
occasional
firmness
by
a
sudden
return
to
geniality
offered
his
hand
in
token
of
peace
mr
landale
took
it
his
grasp
however
was
limp
and
cold
i
am
quite
ready
to
express
regret
he
said
in
a
toneless
voice
since
that
would
seem
to
be
gratification
to
you
and
moreover
seems
to
be
the
tacit
condition
on
which
you
will
refrain
from
turning
me
out
i
ought
indeed
to
have
abstained
from
referring
however
vaguely
to
past
events
for
the
plain
reason
that
anything
i
could
say
would
already
have
come
too
late
to
prevent
the
grievous
deed
you
have
now
pledged
yourself
to
commit
rupert
exclaimed
sir
adrian
stepping
back
a
pace
too
amazed
at
the
instant
for
indignation
now
in
your
turn
hear
me
adrian
continued
mr
landale
with
his
blackest
look
i
have
listened
to
your
summing
up
of
our
respective
cases
with
perfect
patience
notwithstanding
a
certain
assumption
of
superiority
whichallow
me
to
insist
on
thisis
somewhat
ridiculous
from
you
to
me
you
complain
of
my
misunderstanding
you
briefly
this
is
absurd
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
understand
you
better
than
you
do
yourself
on
the
other
hand
it
is
you
that
do
not
understand
me
i
have
no
wish
to
paraphrase
your
little
homily
of
two
minutes
ago
but
the
heads
of
my
refutation
are
inevitably
suggested
by
the
points
of
your
indictment
to
use
your
own
manner
of
speech
my
dear
adrian
i
have
no
wish
to
assume
injured
disinterestedness
when
speaking
of
my
doings
with
regard
to
you
and
your
belongings
and
especially
to
this
old
place
of
yours
of
our
family
you
have
only
to
look
and
see
for
yourself
mr
landale
made
a
wide
comprehensive
gesture
which
seemed
to
embrace
the
whole
of
the
noble
estate
the
admirably
kept
mansion
with
walls
now
flushed
in
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
the
orderly
maintenance
of
the
vast
grounds
the
prosperousness
of
its
dependenciesall
in
fact
that
the
brothers
could
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
body
from
where
they
stood
and
all
that
they
could
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
mind
alone
go
and
verify
whether
i
fulfilled
my
duty
with
respect
to
the
trust
which
was
yours
but
which
you
have
allowed
to
devolve
upon
my
shoulders
and
ask
yourself
whether
you
would
have
fulfilled
it
betterif
as
well
i
claim
no
more
than
this
recognition
for
as
you
pointed
out
the
position
carried
its
advantages
if
it
entailed
arduous
responsibility
too
it
was
my
hope
that
heirs
of
my
body
would
live
to
perpetuate
this
pridethis
work
of
mine
it
was
not
to
be
now
that
you
step
in
again
and
that
possibly
your
flesh
will
reap
the
benefits
i
have
laboured
to
produce
ask
yourself
adrian
whether
you
who
shirked
your
own
natural
duties
would
have
buckled
to
the
task
under
my
circumstancesdistrusted
by
your
brother
disliked
and
secretly
despised
by
all
your
dependants
who
reserved
all
their
love
and
admiration
for
the
real
master
oh
i
know
the
cant
phrase
although
he
chose
to
abandon
his
position
and
yield
himself
to
the
stream
of
his
own
inertness
the
real
master
who
in
the
end
can
find
no
better
description
for
these
years
of
faithful
service
than
hostility
and
ingratitude
sir
adrian
halted
a
pace
a
little
moved
by
the
speciousness
of
the
pleading
the
incidental
reference
to
that
one
grief
of
his
brothers
life
was
of
a
kind
which
could
never
fail
to
arouse
generous
sympathy
in
his
heart
but
mr
landale
had
not
come
to
the
critical
point
of
his
say
and
he
did
not
choose
to
allow
the
chapter
of
emotion
to
begin
just
yet
but
he
continued
pursuing
his
restless
walk
again
to
use
your
own
phraseology
i
am
not
merely
recriminating
i
too
wish
you
to
understand
me
it
would
be
useless
to
discuss
now
what
you
elect
to
call
my
hostility
in
past
days
i
had
to
keep
up
the
position
demanded
by
our
ancient
name
to
keep
it
up
amid
a
society
against
whose
every
tenet
almostevery
prejudice
you
may
call
themyou
chose
to
run
counter
my
antagonism
to
your
mode
of
acting
and
thinking
was
precisely
measured
by
your
own
against
the
world
in
which
the
landales
as
a
family
hold
a
stake
let
that
therefore
be
dismissed
and
let
us
come
at
once
to
the
special
hostility
you
complain
of
in
me
since
the
troublesome
arrival
of
aunt
rose
and
her
wards
as
the
very
thing
which
i
was
most
anxious
to
prevent
if
possible
has
after
all
come
to
pass
the
present
argument
may
seem
useless
but
you
have
courted
it
yourself
most
anxious
to
preventif
possible
repeated
sir
adrian
slowly
this
from
a
younger
brother
is
almost
cynical
rupert
cynical
retorted
mr
landale
with
a
furious
laugh
why
you
have
given
sound
to
the
very
word
i
would
in
anybody
elses
case
have
applied
to
a
behaviour
such
as
yours
is
it
possible
adrian
said
rupert
turning
to
look
his
brother
in
the
eyes
with
a
look
of
profound
malice
that
it
has
not
occurred
to
you
yet
that
cynical
will
be
the
verdict
the
world
will
pass
on
the
question
of
your
marriage
with
that
young
girl
sir
adrian
flushed
darkly
and
remained
silent
for
a
pace
or
two
then
with
a
puzzled
look
i
fail
to
understand
you
he
said
simply
i
am
no
longer
young
of
course
yet
in
years
i
am
not
preposterously
old
as
for
the
other
pointsname
and
fortune
but
rupert
interrupted
him
with
a
sharp
exclamation
which
betrayed
the
utmost
nervous
exasperation
pshaw
if
i
did
not
know
you
so
well
i
would
say
you
were
playing
at
candour
thisthis
unconventionality
of
yours
would
have
led
you
into
curious
pitfalls
adrian
had
you
been
obliged
to
live
in
the
world
my
hostility
has
saved
you
from
some
already
i
knowmore
is
the
pity
it
could
not
save
you
from
thisfor
it
passes
all
bounds
that
you
should
meditate
such
an
unnatural
act
upon
my
soul
in
the
most
natural
manner
in
the
world
one
must
be
an
adrian
landale
and
live
on
a
tower
for
the
best
part
of
ones
life
to
reach
such
a
pitch
ofunconventionality
let
us
call
it
for
gods
sake
exclaimed
sir
adrian
suddenly
losing
patience
what
are
you
driving
at
man
in
what
way
can
my
marriage
with
a
young
lady
who
inconceivable
as
it
may
be
has
found
something
to
love
in
me
in
what
way
i
say
can
it
be
accounted
cynical
i
am
not
subtle
enough
to
perceive
it
to
any
one
but
you
sneered
the
other
coming
to
his
climax
with
a
sort
of
cruel
deliberation
it
would
hardly
require
special
subtleness
to
perceive
that
for
the
man
of
mature
age
to
marry
the
daughter
after
having
in
the
days
of
his
youth
been
the
lover
of
the
mother
is
a
proceeding
the
very
idea
of
which
is
somewhat
revolting
in
the
average
individual
there
are
many
rous
in
st
james
who
would
shrink
before
it
yet
you
the
enlightened
philosopher
the
moralist
but
sir
adrian
breathing
quickly
laid
his
hand
heavily
on
his
brothers
shoulder
when
you
say
the
mothers
lover
rupert
he
said
in
a
contained
voice
which
was
as
ominous
of
storm
as
the
first
mutters
of
thunder
you
mean
that
i
loved
heryou
do
not
mean
to
insinuate

my
dear
adrian
i
think
nothing
all
this
is
ancient
history
which
after
all
has
long
concerned
only
you
you
know
best
what
occurred
in
the
old
days

of
course
a
man
of
honour
is
bound
to
deny
all
tales
affecting
a
ladys
virtue
even
you
i
fancy
would
condescend
so
far
but
nevertheless
reflect
how
this
marriage
will
rake
up
the
old
story

be
remembered
how
you
for
the
sake
of
remaining
by

abandoned
your
home
to
fight
in
a
cause
that
did
not
concern
you
nay
more
turned
your
back
for
the
time
upon
those
advanced
social
theories
which
even
at
your

you

no

you

you
have
outwitted

this
time
hear
me
now
if
anything
could
have
suggested
to
me
this
alliance
with
the
child
of
one
i
loved
so
madly
and
so
hopelessly
the
thought
that
such
dastardly
slander
could
ever
have
been
current
would
have
done
so
the
world
having
nothing
to
gain
by
the
belief
will
never
credit
that
sir
adrian
landale
would
marry
the
daughter
of
his
paramourhowever
his
own
brother
may
deem
to
his
advantage
to
seem
to
think
so
the
fact
of
molly
de
savenaye
becoming
lady
landale
would
alone
had
such
ill
rumours
indeed
been
current
in
the
past
dispel
the
ungenerous
legend
for
ever
there
were
a
few
moments
of
silence
while
sir
adrian
battled
in
the
tumult
of
his
indignation
for
selfcontrol
again
while
rupert
realising
that
he
had
outwitted
himself
indeed
bestowed
inward
curses
upon
most
of
his
relations
and
his
own
fate
the
elder
brother
resumed
at
length
with
a
faint
smile
and
so
you
see
even
if
you
had
spoken
out
in
time
it
would
have
been
of
little
avail
then
he
added
bitterly
i
have
received
a
wound
from
an
unforeseen
quarter
you
have
dealt
it
to
no
purpose
rupert
as
you
see

though
it
may
be
some
compensation
to
such
a
nature
as
yours
to
know
that
you
have
left
in
it
a
subtle
venom
the
sun
had
already
sunk
away
and
its
glow
behind
the
waters
had
faded
to
the
merest
tinge
in
the
cold
shadow
of
rising
night
the
two
men
advanced
silently
homewards
sir
adrians
soul
guided
by
the
invidious
words
had
flown
back
to
that
dead
year
the
central
point
of
his
existenceit
was
true
men
will
be
menin
that
very
house
yonder
he
had
betrayed
his
love
to
her
on
board
the
ship
that
took
them
away
and
by
the
camp
fire
on
the
eve
of
fight
he
had
pleaded
the
cause
of
his
passion
not
ignobly
indeed
with
no
thought
of
the
baseness
which
rupert
assigned
to
him
yet
with
a
selfish
disregard
of
her
position
of
his
own
grave
trust
and
it
was
with
a
glow
of
pride
in
the
ever
living
object
of
his
lifes
devotionof
gratitude
almostthat
he
recalled
the
noble
simplicity
with
which
the
woman
whom
he
had
just
heard
classed
among
the
everyday
sinners
of
society
had
without
one
grandiloquent
word
without
even
losing
her
womanly
softness
kept
her
lover
as
well
as
herself
in
the
path
of
her
lofty
idealtill
the
end
and
yet
she
did
love
him
at
the
last
awful
moment
sinking
into
the
very
jaws
of
death
the
secret
of
her
heart
had
escaped
her
and
nownow
her
beauty
and
something
of
her
own
life
and
soul
was
left
to
him
in
her
child
as
the
one
fit
object
on
which
to
devote
that
tenderness
which
time
could
not
change





after
a
while
from
the
darkness
by
his
side
came
the
voice
of
his
brother
again
in
altered
hardly
recognisable
accents
adrian
those
last
words
of
yours
were
severeunjust
i
do
not
deserve
such
interpretation
of
my
motives
is
it
my
fault
that
you
are
not
as
other
men
am
i
to
be
blamed
for
judging
you
by
the
ordinary
standard
but
you
have
convinced
me
you
were
as
chivalrous
as
ccile
was
pure
and
if
needs
be
believe
me
adrian
i
will
maintain
it
so
in
the
face
of
the
world
yes
i
misunderstood
youand
wounded
you
as
you
say
but
such
was
not
my
intention
forgive
me
they
had
come
to
the
door
sir
adrian
paused
there
was
a
rapid
revulsion
in
his
kindly
mind
at
the
extraordinary
sound
of
humble
words
from
his
brother
and
with
a
new
emotion
he
replied
taking
the
hand
that
with
wellacted
diffidence
seemed
to
seek
his
grasp
perhaps
we
have
both
something
to
forgive
each
other
i
fear
you
did
not
misjudge
me
so
much
as
you
misjudged
her
who
left
me
that
precious
legacy
but
believe
that
believe
it
as
you
have
just
now
said
rupert
the
mother
of
those
children
never
stooped
to
human
frailtyher
course
in
her
short
and
noble
life
was
as
bright
and
pure
as
the
light
of
day
without
another
word
the
two
brothers
shook
hands
and
reentered
their
home
sir
adrian
sought
miss
odonoghue
whom
he
now
found
in
converse
with
molly
and
with
a
grave
eagerness
that
put
the
culminating
touch
to
the
old
ladys
triumph
urged
the
early
celebration
of
his
nuptials
mr
landale
repaired
to
his
own
study
where
in
solitude
he
could
give
loose
rein
to
his
fury
of
disappointment
and
consider
as
carefully
as
he
might
in
the
circumstances
how
best
to
work
the
new
situation
to
his
own
advantage





even
on
that
day
that
had
been
filled
with
so
many
varied
and
poignant
emotions
for
him
through
the
dream
in
which
his
whole
being
seemed
to
float
sir
adrian
found
a
moment
to
think
of
the
humble
followers
whom
he
had
left
so
abruptly
on
the
island
and
of
the
pleasure
the
auspicious
news
would
bring
to
them
it
was
late
at
night
and
just
before
parting
with
the
guest
who
was
so
soon
to
be
mistress
under
his
roof
he
paused
on
the
stairs
before
a
window
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
bay
molly
drew
closer
and
leant
against
his
shoulder
and
thus
both
gazed
forth
silently
for
some
time
at
the
clear
distant
light
the
luminous
eye
calmly
watching
over
the
treacherous
sands
that
light
of
scartheyit
was
the
image
of
the
solitary
placid
life
to
which
he
had
bidden
adieu
for
ever
which
even
now
at
this
brief
interval
of
half
a
day
seemed
as
far
distant
as
the
years
of
despair
and
vicissitude
and
disgust
to
which
it
had
succeeded
a
man
can
feel
the
suddenly
revealed
charm
of
things
that
have
ceased
to
be
without
regretting
them
with
the
dear
young
head
that
he
loved
with
a
love
already
as
old
as
her
very
years
pressing
his
cheek
with
that
slender
hand
in
his
grasp
the
same
for
his
love
was
all
miracle
that
he
had
held
in
the
hotpulsed
days
of
oldhe
yet
felt
his
mind
wander
back
to
his
nest
of
dreams
he
thought
with
gratitude
of
ren
the
singleminded
faithful
familiar
of
old
margery
the
nurse
who
had
tended
cciles
children
as
well
as
her
young
master
thought
of
their
joy
when
they
should
hear
of
the
marvellous
knitting
together
into
the
web
of
his
fate
of
all
those
faroff
ties
in
full
harmony
with
such
fleeting
thoughts
came
mollys
words
at
length
breaking
the
silence
will
you
take
me
back
to
that
strange
old
place
of
yours
adrian
when
we
are
married
sir
adrian
kissed
her
forehead
and
would
you
not
fear
the
rough
wild
place
child
he
murmured
not
for
ever
i
mean
laughed
the
girl
for
then
my
mission
would
not
be
fulfilledwhich
was
to
make
of
adrian
sir
adrian
indeed
but
now
and
again
to
recall
those
lovely
days
whenwhen
you
were
so
distracted
for
the
love
of
murthering
moll
and
the
fear
lest
she
should
see
it
you
will
not
dismantle
those
queer
rooms
that
received
so
hospitably
the
limping
draggledtailed
guestthey
must
again
shelter
her
when
she
comes
as
proud
lady
landale
how
delicious
it
would
be
if
the
tempest
would
only
rage
again
and
the
seamew
shriek
and
the
caverns
roar
and
thunder
and
i
knew
you
were
as
happy
as
i
am
sure
to
be
all
shall
be
kept
up
even
as
you
left
it
answered
sir
adrian
moved
by
tender
emotion
to
be
made
glorious
again
by
the
light
of
your
youth
and
fairness
and
renny
shall
be
cook
again
and
maid
of
all
work
my
poor
renny
what
joy
when
he
hears
of
his
masters
happiness
and
all
through
the
child
of
his
beloved
mistress
but
he
will
have
to
spend
a
sobering
time
of
solitude
out
there
till
i
can
find
a
substitute
for
his
duties
you
are
very
much
attached
to
that
funny
little
retainer
adrian
said
molly
after
a
pause
to
no
man
alive
do
i
owe
so
much
with
no
one
have
i
had
through
life
so
much
in
common
came
the
grave
reply
then
returned
the
girl
you
would
thank
me
for
telling
you
of
the
means
of
making
the
good
mans
exile
less
heavy
until
you
take
him
back
with
you
no
doubt
there
was
a
tone
of
surprise
and
inquiry
in
his
voice
why
it
is
simple
enough
have
you
never
heard
of
his
admiration
for
moggie
mearson
our
maid
let
them
marry
they
will
make
a
good
pair
though
funny
what
you
never
knew
it
of
course
not
or
you
would
not
have
had
the
heart
to
keep
the
patient
lovers
apart
so
long
let
them
marry
my
lord
of
pulwick
it
will
complete
the
romance
of
the
persecuted
savenayes
of
brittany
and
their
helpful
friends
of
the
distant
north
musing
sir
adrian
fell
into
silence
the
faithful
foolish
heart
that
never
even
told
its
secret
desire
for
very
fear
of
being
helped
to
win
it
by
whom
happiness
and
love
were
held
to
be
too
dearly
bought
at
the
price
of
separation
from
the
lonely
exile
eh
bien
dreamer
cried
the
girl
gaily
thank
you
molly
said
sir
adrian
turning
to
her
with
shining
eyes
this
is
a
pretty
thought
a
good
thought
renny
will
indeed
doubly
bless
the
day
when
providence
sent
you
to
pulwick
and
so
the
following
morn
mr
renny
potter
was
summoned
to
hear

gently
rebuked
for
his
long
reticence

dismissed

of

glowing
moggie
with
a
promise

be
celebrated
at

those
of

an
assurance

fine

was

that
night

whether
the

my

and
ill

no
more
on

head
at

i

to

wretched

out
in
earnest
and
not
go
to

it
is
the

i
shall
have

again
upon
such
an
afternoon
there

my

you
are
wandering
come
back
to
business
what
then
has
marriage
brought
me
first
of
all
a
husband
that
is
to
say
another
person
a
man
who
has
the
right
to
meto
whom
i
myself
have
given
that
rightto
have
me
to
hold
me
as
it
runs
in
the
terrible
service
the
thunders
of
which
were
twice
rolled
out
upon
my
head
and
which
have
been
ringing
there
ever
since
and
i
molly
gave
of
my
own
free
will
that
best
and
most
blessed
of
all
gifts
my
own
free
will
away
i
am
surrounded
as
it
were
by
barriers
hemmed
in
bound
up
kept
in
leading
strings
i
mind
me
of
the
seagull
on
the
island
tis
all
in
the
most
loving
care
in
the
world
of
course
but
oh
the
oppression
of
it
i
must
hide
my
feelings
as
well
as
i
can
for
in
my
heart
i
would
not
grieve
that
good
man
that
excellent
man
that
pattern
of
kind
gentlemanoh
oh
ohit
will
outthat
dreary
man
that
dull
man
that
most
melancholy
of
all
men
who
sighs
more
than
he
smiles
and
i
warrant
of
the
two
his
sighs
are
the
more
cheerful
who
looks
at
his
beautiful
wife
as
if
he
saw
a
ghost
and
kisses
her
as
if
he
kissed
a
corpse
there
is
a
mate
for
molly
the
mate
she
chose
for
herself
so
much
for
the

itthat
advantage

i

rupert
still

they
are

i
am
told
occasionally

my
intimate
conviction
is
however
often
they
may
be
going
they
will
never
go

i
look
and
i

this
is
all
that
marriage
has
brought
me
and
what
has
it
not
taken
from
me
my
delight
in
existence
my
independence
my
hopes
my
belief
in

my
belief
in

charity
in

destroyed
at

all
to
gratify
my
curiosity
as
to
a
romantic
mystery
my
vanity
as
to
my
own
powers
of
fascination
well
i
have
solved
the
mystery
and
behold
it
was
nothing
i
have
eaten
of
the
fruit
of
knowledge
and
it
is
tasteless
in
my
mouth
i
have
made
my
capture
with
my
little
bow
and
spear
and
i
am
as
embarrassed
of
my
captive
as
he
of
me
we
pull
at
the
chain
that
binds
us
together
nay
such
being
the
law
of
this
world
between
men

are
reversed
my
captive
is
now
my
master
and
molly
is
the
slave
tanty
i
could
curse
thee
for
thy
officiousness
from
the
tip
of
thy
coal
black
wig
to
the
sole
of
thy
platter
shoebut
that
i
am
too
good
to
curse
thee
at
all
poor
book
of
my
life
that
i
was
so
eager
to
fill
in
that
was
to
have
held
a
narrative
all
thrilling
and
all
varied
now
will
i
set
forth
in
thee
my
failure
my
hopelessness
and
after
that
close
thee
for
ever
of
what
use
indeed
to
chronicle
when
there
is
nought
to
tell
but
flatness
chill
monotony
on
every
side
when
even
the
workings
of
my
soul
cannot
interest
me
to
follow
since
they
can
now
foreshadow
nothing
lead
to
nothing
but
fruitless
struggle
or
tame
resignation
i
discovered
my
mistakenot
the
whole
of
it
but
enough
to
give
me
a
dreadful
foreboding
of
its
hideousness
not
two
hours
after
the
nuptial
ceremony
adrian
had
borne
himself
up
to
that
with
the
romantic
mysterious
dignity
of
presence
that
first
caught
my
silly
fancy
behind
which
i
had
pictured
such
fascinating
depths
of
passionof
firealas
when
he
looked
at
me
it
was
with
that
air
of
wondering
almost
timid
affection
battling
with
i
know
not
what
flame
of
rapture
with
which
look
i
have
become
so
fatally
familiar
sincewithout
the
flame
of
rapture
be
it
understood
which
seems
to
have
rapidly
burnt
away
to
a
very
ash
of
grey
despondency
and
selfreproach
i
could
have
sworn
even
as
he
gave
me
his
arm
to
meet
and
receive
the
congratulations
of
our
guests
that
the
glow
upon
his
cheek
the
poise
of
his
head
denoted
the
pride
any
man
were
he
not
an
idiot
nor
a
brute
must
feel
in
presenting
his
bridesuch
a
brideto
the
world
then
we
went
in
to
the
great
dining
hall
where
the
wedding
feast
a
very
splendid
one
was
spread
all
the
gentlemen
looked
with
admiration
at
me
many
with
envy
at
adrian
i
knew
that
i
was
beautiful
in
my
fine
white
satin
with
my
veil
thrown
back
without
the
flattering
whispers
that
reached
me
now
and
again
but
these
were
sweet
to
hear
nevertheless
i
knew
myself
the
centre
of
all
eyes
and
it
elated
me
so
too
did
the
tingling
flavour
of
the
one
glass
of
sparkling
wine
i
drank
to
my
fortunes
immediately
upon
this
silent
toast
of
lady
landale
to
herself
rupert
rose
and
in
choice
words
and
silverringing
voice
proposed
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
there
was
a
merry
bustling
pause
while
the
glasses
were
filled
then
rising
to
their
feet
as
with
one
man
all
the
gentlemen
stood
with
brimming
goblets
one
instant
extended
the
next
emptied
to
the
last
drop
and
then
the
cheers
rang
out
swelling
up
the
rafters
three
times
three
seeming
to
carry
my
soul
along
with
them
i
felt
my
heart
expand
and
throb
with
an
emotion
i
never
knew
in
it
before
which
seemed
to
promise
vast
future
capacities
of
pain
and
delight
i
turned
to
my
husband
instinctively
looking
for
expecting
i
could
not
explain
why
an
answering
fire
in
his
eyes
this
was
the
last
moment
of
my
illusions
from
thence
they
began
to
shrivel
away
with
a
terrifying
rapidity
adrian
sat
with
a
face
that
looked
old
and
lined
and
grey
with
haggard
unseeing
eyes
gazing
forth
into
space
as
though
fixing
some
invisible
and
spectre
show
he
seemed
as
if
wrapt
in
a
world
of
his
own
to
which
none
of
us
had
entrance
least
of
all
i
his
wife
the
shouts
around
us
died
away
there
were
cries
upon
him
for
speechspeech
then
playful
querieshow
is
this
sir
adrian
so
bashful
egad
next
nudges
were
exchanged
looks
of
wonder
and
an
old
voice
speaking
broadly
yes
by
george
it
was
saying
i
remember
it
well
by
george
in
this
very
room
now
twenty
years
ago
here
gentlemen

was
a
lovely
creatureeheh
hush
said
some
one
and
there
was
a
running
circle
of
frowns
and
the
old
voice
ceased
as
abruptly
as
if
its
owner
had
been
seized
by
the
weasand
in
the
heavy
embarrassed
silence
i
caught
tantys
red
perturbed
look
and
ruperts
smile
but
adrian
sat
onlike
a
ghost
among
the
living
or
a
live
man
among
the
dead
and
this
was
my
gallant
bridegroom
i
seized
him
by
the
handare
you
ill
adrian
he
started
and
looked
round
at
meoh
that
look
it
seemed
to
burn
into
my
soul
i
shall
never
forget
the
hopelessness
the
dull
sadness
of
it
and
theni
dont
know
what
he
read
in
my
answering
glancethe
mute
agonised
question
followed
by
a
terror
they
want
you
to
speak
i
whispered
and
shook
the
cold
hand
i
held
in
a
fury
of
impatience
his
lips
trembled
he
stared
at
me
blankly
my
god
my
god
what

i
done
he
muttered
to
himself
cciles

child
i
could
have
burst
out
sobbing
but
seeing
ruperts
face
bent
down
towards
his
plate
demure
and
solemn
yet
stamped
for
all
his
cleverness
with
an
almost
devilish
triumph
my
pride
rose
and
my
courage
every
one
else
seemed
to
be
looking
towards
us
i
stood
up
good
friends
i
said
i
see
that
my
husband
is
so
much
touched
by
the
welcome
that
you
are
giving
his
bride
the
welcome
that
you
are
giving
him
after
his
long
exile
from
his
house
that
he
is
quite
unable
to
answer
you
as
he
would
wish
but
lest
you
should
misunderstand
this
silence
of
his
i
am
bold
enough
to
answer
you
in
his
name
andsince
it
is
but
a
few
moments
ago
that
you
have
seen
us
made
one
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
do
so
we
thank
you
my
heart
was
beating
to
suffocationbut
i
carried
bravely
on
till
i
was
drowned
in
a
storm
of
acclamations
to
which
the
first
cheers
were
as
nothing
they
drank
my
health
again
and
again
i
heard
the
old
gentleman
of
the
indiscreet
voicei
have
learned
since
he
is
stone
deaf
and
i
daresay
he
flattered
himself
he
spoke
in
a
whisperproclaim
that
i
was
my
mother
all
over
again
begadso
had
she
spoken
to
them
twenty
years
ago
in
this
very
room
here
tanty
came
to
the
rescue
and
carried
me
off
i
dared
not
trust
myself
to
look
at
adrian
as
i
left
but
i
knew
that
he
followed
me
to
the
door
from
which
i
presumed
that
he
had
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
in
some
degree
since
that
day
we
have
been
like
two
who
walk
along
on
opposite
banks
of
a
widening
streamever
more
and
more
divided
i
have
told
no
one
of
my
despair
it
is
curious
but
little
wifely
as
i
feel
towards
him
there
is
something
in
me
that
keeps
me
back
from
the
disloyalty
of
discussing
my
husband
with
other
people
and
it
is
not
even
as
it
might
have
beenthis
is
what
maddens
me
we
are
always
at
cross
purposes
some
wilful
spirit
wakes
in
me
at
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
always
gentle
and
restrained
and
echoing
of
past
sadness
under
his
mild
tender
look
at
the
every
fresh
sign
of
his
perpetual
watchful
anxietyi
give
him
wayward
answers
frowning
greetings
sighs
pouts
i
feel
at
times
a
savage
desire
to
wound
to
anger
him
and
as
far
as
i
dare
venture
i
have
ventured
yet
could
not
rouse
in
him
one
spark
even
of
proper
indignation
the
word
of
the
riddle
lay
in
that
broken
exclamation
of
his
at
our
wedding
feast
cciles
child
his
wife
then
is

i
have
failed
when
i
thought
to
have
conqueredand
with
the
consciousness
of
failure
have
lost
my
power
even
to
the
desire
of
regaining
it
my
dead
mother
is
my
rival
her
shade
rises
between
me
and
my

shall
perhaps
go
down
to
my
grave
without
having
known

i
thought
i
had
found
it
on
that
day
when
he
took
me
in
his
arms
in
that
odious
librarymy
heart
melted
when
he
so
tenderly
kissed
my
lips
and
now
the
very
remembrance
of
that
moment
angers

am
i
only
a
weak
helpless
child
that
i
can
arouse
no
more
from
the
man
to
whom
i
have
given
myself

the
gates
of
life
had
been
opened

they
led
me
to
a
warm
comfortable
prison

this
is

there
is
a
light
in
madeleines
eyes
a
ring
in
her
voice
a
smile
upon
her
lip
she
has
bloomed
into
a
beauty
that
i
could
hardly
have
imagined
and
this
is
because
of
this
unknown
whom
she
loves
she
breathes
the
fulness
of
the
flower
and
byandby
no
doubt
she
will
taste
the
fulness
of
the
fruit
she
will
be
complete
she
will
be
fed
and
i
am
to
starve

is
coming
to
me
i
do
not

i
feel
that
i
could

her
these
favours
that
i
do
grudge
them
to
her
i
am
sick
at

she
has
proved
false

i

that
she
meets
this
man
adrian
too
knows
it
and
more
of
him
than
he
will
tell
me
and
he
approves
i
am
treated
like

if
i
had
the
spirit
for
it
i
would
set
myself
to
discovering
this
grand
mystery

then
let
them
beware
they
would
have
none

prove
one

the

i

bitter

again
when
a
hard
word

me
she
gives
me
a
great
surprised
reproachful
glance
as
of
a
petted
child
that
has
been
hurt

mostly
she
scarcely
seems

she
would
only
stammer
the

had
promised
and
press
her
hot

the
dawn
of
an
eventful
day
ruperts
behaviour
at
home
since
his
brothers
wedding
had
been
as
even
molly
was
bound
to
admit
to
herself
beyond
reproach
in
tactfulness
quiet
dignity
and
seeming
cheerfulness
he
abdicated
from
his
position
of
trust
at
once
and
without
the
smallest
reservation
wooed
madeleine
with
so
great
a
discretion
that
her
dreamy
eyes
saw
in
him
only
a
kind
relative
and
he
treated
his
sisterinlaw
for
all
her
freaks
of
bearing
to
him
with
a
perfect
gentleness
and
gentility
at
times
sir
adrian
would
watch
him
with
great
eyes
what
meant
this
change
the
guileless
philosopher
would
ask
himself
and
wonder
if
he
had
judged
his
brother
too
harshly
all
through
life
or
if
it
was
his
plain
speaking
in
their
last
quarrel
which
had
put
things
in
their
true
light
to
him
and
awakened
some
innate
generosity
of
feeling
or
yet

with
misgivingit
was
love
for
pretty
madeleine

was

marvel
if
so
how
would
this
proud
rebellious
nature
bear
another

spoke
with
unaffected
regret
about
leaving
pulwick
at
the
same
time
in
spite
of
mollys
curling
lip
giving
it
to
be
understood
that
his
removal
was
only
a
matter
of
time
for
the
ostensible
purpose
indeed
of
finding
himself
another
home
he
made
in
the
beginning
of
march
the
second
month
after
his
brothers
marriage
several
absences
which
lasted
a
couple
of
days
or
more
and
from
which
he
would
return
with
an
eager
sparkle
in
his
eye
almost
a
brightness
on
his
olive
cheek
to
sit
beside
madeleines
embroidery
frame
pulling
her
silks
and
snipping
with
her
scissors
and
talking
gaily
persistently
with
such
humour
and
colour
as
at
last
to
draw
that
young
ladys
attention
from
far
off
musings
to
his
words
with
smiles
and
laughter
meanwhile
molly
would
sit
unoccupied
brooding
watching
them
now
fiercely
from
under
her
black
brows
now
scornfully
now
abstractedly
the
while
she
nibbled
at
her
delicate
fingernails
or
ruthlessly
dragged
them
along
the
velvet
arms
of
her
chair
with
the
gesture
of
a
charming
yet
distracted
cat
sir
adrian
would
first
tramp
the
rooms
with
unwitting
restlessness
halting
it
might
be
beside
his
wife
to
strive
to
engage
her
into
speech
with
him
and
failing
would
betake
himself
at
length
with
a
heavy
sigh
to
solitude
or
yet
he
would
sit
down
to
his
organthe
new
one
in
the
great
hall
which
had
been
put
up
since
his
marriage
at
mollys
own
gay
suggestion
during
their
brief
betrothaland
music
would
peal
out
upon
them
till
lady
landales
stormy
heart
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
she
would
rise
in
her
turn
fly
to
the
shelter
of
her
room
and
roll
her
head
in
the
pillows
to
stifle
the
sound
of
sobs
crying
from
the
depths
of
her
soul
against
heavens
injustice
anon
railing
in
a
frenzy
of
impotent
anger
against
the
musician
who
had
such
passion
in
him
and
gave
it
to
his
music
alone
during
ruperts
absences
that
curious
intimacy
which
molly
had
contemptuously
noted
between
her
sister
and
sisterinlaw
displayed
itself
in
more
conspicuous
manner
miss
landales
long
sallow
visage
sported
its
airs
of
mystery
and
importance
its
languishing
leers
undisguisedly
so
long
as
her
brother
ruperts
place
was
empty
and
though
her
visits
to
the
rectors
grave
were
now
almost
quotidian
she
departed
upon
them
with
looks
of
wrapt
importance
and
returning
sought
madeleines
chamber
when
that
maiden
did
not
herself
stroll
out
to
meet
her
in
the
woods
her
countenance
invariably
wreathed
with
suppressed
yet
triumphant
smiles
instead
of
the
old
selfassertive
dejection





the
15th
of
march
of
that
year
was
to
be
a
memorable
day
in
the
lives
of
so
many
of
those
who
then
either
dwelt
in
pulwick
or
had
dealings
on
that
wide
estate
miss
landale
who
had
passed
the
midnight
hour
in
poring
over
the
delightful
wickedness
of
lara
and
upon
at
length
retiring
to
her
pillow
had
had
a
sentimental
objection
to
shutting
out
the
romantic
light
of
the
moon
by
curtain
or
shutter
was
roused
into
wakefulness
soon
after
dawn
by
a
glorious
white
burst
of
early
sunshine
as
a
rule
the
excellent
soul
liked
to
lie
abed
till
the
last
available
moment
but
that
morning
she
was
up
with
the
sun
when
dressed
she
drew
a
letter
from
a
secret
casket
with
manifold
precautions
as
though
she
were
surrounded
with
prying
eyes
and
placing
it
in
her
reticule
hastened
forth
to
seek
the
little
lonely
disused
churchyard
by
the
shore
she
afterwards
remarked
that
she
could
never
forget
in
what
agitation
of
spirits
and
with
what
strange
presentiment
of
evil
she
was
led
to
this
activity
at
so
unwonted
an
hour
the
truth
was
however
that
miss
landale
tripped
along
through
the
damp
wooded
path
as
gaily
as
if
she
were
going
to
visit
her
living
lover
instead
of
his
granite
tomb
and
that
in
lieu
of
evil
omens
a
hundred
fantastically
sentimental
thoughts
floated
through
her
brain
as
merrily
and
irresponsibly
as
the
motes
in
the
long
shafts
of
brilliancy
that
cleaved
swordlike
through
the
mists
upon
her
from
out
the
east
visions
of
madeleines
face
when
she
would
learn
before
breakfast
that
sophia
had
actually
been
to
the
churchyard
already
visions
of
whom
she
might
meet
there
rehearsals
of
a
romantic
scene
upon
that
hallowed
spot
of
her
own
blushes
her
knowing
looks
her
playful
remonstrances
with
touching
allusions
to
one
who
had
loved
and
lost
herself
and
who
thus
c
c
miss
landale
tossed
her
long
faded
ringlets
quite
coquettishly
turned
one
slim
bony
hand
with
coy
gesture
before
her
approving
eyes
then
she
patted
her
reticule
and
hurried
on
with
fresh
zest
enjoying
the
tart
whisper
of
the
wind
against
her
well
bonneted
face
the
exquisite
virginal
beauty
of
the
earth
in
the
early
spring
of
the
day
and
of
the
year
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
trees
her
heart
leaped
and
then
almost
stood
still
as
she
perceived
in
the
churchyard
lying
below
her
beside
the
great
slab
of
granite
which
lay
over
the
remains
of
her
longdeparted
beloved
one
the
figure
of
a
man
whose
back
was
turned
towards
her
and
whose
erect
outline
was
darkly
silhouetted
against
the
low
dazzling
light
then
a
simper
of
exceeding
archness
crept
upon
miss
landales
lips
and
with
as
genteel
an
amble
as
the
somewhat
precipitate
nature
of
the
small
piece
of
ground
that
yet
divided
her
from
the
graveyard
would
allow
she
proceeded
on
her
way
at
the
click
of
the
lychgate
under
her
hand
the
man
turned
sharply
round
and
looked
at
her
without
moving
further
an
open
letter
fluttered
in
his
hand
his
face
was
still
against
the
light
and
miss
landales
eyes
had
wept
so
many
tears
by
day
and
night
that
her
sight
was
none
of
the
best
she
dropped
a
very
elegant
curtsey
simpered
drew
nearer
and
threw
a
fetching
glance
upwards
then
her
shrill
scream
rang
through
the
still
morning
air
and
frightened
the
birds
in
the
ruined
church
you
are
early
this
morning
sophia
said
mr
landale
sophia
sank
upon
the
tombstone
to
say
that
she
was
green
or
yellow
would
ill
describe
the
ghastliness
of
the
tint
that
suffused
her
naturally
bilious
countenance
still
speechless
she
made
a
frantic
plunge
towards
the
great
urn
that
adorned
the
head
of
the
grave
mr
landale
looked
up
from
his
reading
again
with
a
quiet
smile
i
shall
have
done
in
one
minute
he
remarked
it
is
a
fine
production
egad
full
of
noble
protestations
and
really
highsounding
words
and
then
my
dear
sophia
you
can
take
charge
of
it
and
i
shall
be
quite
ready
for
the
other
which
i
presume
you
have
as
usual
with
youah
in
your
bag
thanks
rupert
ejaculated
the
unfortunate
lady
first
in
agonised
query
and
next
in
agonised
reproach
clasping
her
hands
over
the
precious
reticulerupert
mr
landale
neatly
folded
the
sheet
he
had
been
reading
moistened
with
his
tongue
a
fresh
wafer
which
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
deftly
placing
it
upon
the
exact
spot
from
which
the
original
one
had
been
removed
handed
the
letter
to
his
sister
with
a
little
bow
but
as
with
a
gesture
of
horror
the
latter
refused
to
take
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
tossed
it
carelessly
into
the
urn
now
give
me
madeleines
he
said
peremptorily
rolling
upwards
eyes
of
appeal
the
unhappy
iris
called
upon
heaven
to
witness
that
she
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
betray
her
solemn
trust
but
even
as
she
spoke
the
fictitious
flame
of
courage
withered
away
in
her
shrinking
frame
and
at
the
mere
touch
of
her
brothers
finger
and
thumb
upon
her
wrist
the
mere
sight
of
his
face
bending
masterfully
over
her
with
white
teeth
just
gleaming
between
his
twisting
smile
and
halfveiled
eyes
of
insolent
determination
she
allowed
him
unresisting
to
take
the
bag
from
her
side
protesting
against
the
breach
of
faith
only
by
her
moans
and
the
inept
wringing
of
her
hands
mr
landale
opened
the
bag
tossed
with
cynical
contempt
upon
the
flat
tombstone
sundry
precious
relics
of
the
mouldering
bones
within
and
discovered
at
length
in
an
inner
pocket
a
dainty
flowerscented
note
then
he
flung
down
the
bag
and
proceeded
with
the
same
deliberation
to
open
the
letter
and
peruse
its
delicate
flowing
handwriting
upon
my
word
he
vowed
i
think
this
is
the
prettiest
she
has
written
yet
what
a
sweet
soul
it
is
listen
sophia
you
praise
me
for
my
trust
in
youbut
jack
dear
love
my
trust
is
so
much
a
part
of
my
love
that
the
one
would
not
exist
without
the
other
therefore
do
not
give
me
any
credit

you

i
could
not

loving
you
poor

confiding

ejaculated
mr
landale
as
if
to
himself
carefully
proceeding
the
while
with
his
former
manoeuvres
to
end
by
placing
the
violated
missive
to
all
appearance
intact
beside
its
fellow
we
have
here
a
rank
fellow
a
foul
traitor
to
deal
with
then
wheeling
round
to
his
sister
and
fixing
her
with
piercing
eyes

he
exclaimed
in
tones
of
sternest
rebuke
i
am

miss
landale
raised
mesmerised

eyes
upon
him
his
dark
utterances
had
already
filled
her
foolish
soul
with
blind
dread
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
once
more
enclosed
the
thin
arm
in
his
light
but
warning

sophia
he
said
solemnly

the
magnitude
of
the
harm
you
have
been
doing
the
frightful
fate
you
have

the
depth
of
the
villainy
you
are
aiding

abetting
you
have
been
acting
as
i
say
in
ignorance
without
realising
the
awful
consequences
of
your
folly
and
duplicity
but
that
you
should
have
chosen
this
sacred
place
for
such
illicit
and
reprehensible
behaviour

who
loved
you
by
the
stones
chosen
and
paid
for
by
my
fraternal
affection
you
should

her

watchful

was
satisfied
with
the

went
on
in

her

had
dried
up
under
the

that

so
gentlemanly
such
an
air
maundered
the
miserable
woman
between
her
chattering
teeth
it
was
quite
accidental
that
we
met
rupert
quite
accidental
i
assure
you
madeleinepoor
dear
girlcame
down
with
me
here
i
wanted
to
show
her
the
ggrave
here
sophia
gurgled
convulsively
remembering
her
brothers
cruel
reproaches
well
she
came
here
with
me
and
as
i
was
kneeling
down
planting
crocuses
just
here
rupert
and
she
was
standing
there
a
young
man
suddenly
leaped
over
the
wall
and
fell
at
her
feet
he
had
not
seen
mealas
it
reminded
me
of
my
own
happiness
and
he
was
so
welldressed
so
courteousand
seemed
such
a
perfect
gentlemanand
he
took
off
his
hat
so
gracefully
i
am
sure
i
never
could
have
believed
it
of
him
and
they
confided
in
me
and
i
promised
bybythose
sacred
ashes
to
keep
their
secret
i
remembered
of
course
what
tanty
had
said
in
her
letter
and
quite
understood
he
was
the
young
gentleman
in
questionbut
they
explained
to
me
how
she
was
under
a
wrong
impression
altogether
he
said
that
the
instant
he
laid
eyes
upon
me
he
saw
i
had
a
feeling
heart
and
he
knew
they
could
trust
me
he
spoke
so
nobly
rupert
and
said
what
better
place
could
they
have
for
their
meetings
than
one
consecrated
to
such
faithful
love
as
this
it
was
so
beautifuland
oh
dear
i
cant
but
think
there
is
some
mistake
and
miss
landale
again
wrung
her
hands
but
i
have
proof
thundered
her
brother
convincing
proof
of
what
i
have
told
you
at
this
very
moment
the
man
who
would
marry
madeleine
forsooth
runs
the
risk
of
imprisonmentnay
of
the
gallows
you
may
have
thought
it
strange
that
i
should
have
opened
and
read
letters
not
addressed
to
me
but
with
misfortune
hanging
over
a
beloved
object
i
did
not
pause
to
consider
myself
my
only
thought
was
to
save
her
here
mr
landale
looked
very
magnanimous
and
thrust
his
fingers
as
he
spoke
through
the
upper
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
with
the
gesture
which
traditionally
accompanies
such
sentiments
these
cheap
effects
proved
generally
irresistible
with
sophia
but
his
personality
had
paled
before
the
tremendous
drama
into
which
the
poor
romanceloving
soul
was
so
suddenly
plunged
and
in
which
in
spite
of
all
her
woe
she
found
an
awful
kind
of
fascination
failing
to
read
any
depth
of
admiration
in
her
roving
eye
rupert
promptly
abandoned
grandiloquence
and
resuming
his
usual
voice
and
manner
he
dropped
his
orders
upon
her
heat
of
agitation
like
a
cool
relentless
stream
under
which
her
last
protest
fizzed
sputtered
and
went
out
i
mean
to
unmask
the
gay
lover
at
my
own
time
and
in
my
own
way
never
fear
i
shall
deal
gently
with
her
you
will
now
take
this
letter
of
his
and
put
it
in
your
bag
leaving
hers
in
that
curious
postoffice
of
yours
yes
rupert
and
you
will
give
his
letter
to
her
at
once
when
you
go
in
without
one
word
of
having
met
me
y

yes
rupert
as
you
are
too
great
a
fool
to
be
trusted
if
you
once
begin
to
talk
you
will
have
a
headache
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
go
to
bed
in
a
dark
room
y

yes
rupert
you
will
moreover
swear
to
me
now
that
you
will
not
speak
of
our
interview
here
till
i
give
you
leave
say
i
swear
i
will
not
i
swear
i
will
not

you
fool
sophias
lips
murmured
an
inaudible
something
but
there
was
such
complete
submission
in
every
line
and
curve
of
her
figure
in
the
very
droop
of
her
ringlets
and
the
helpless
appeal
of
her
gaze
that
rupert
was
satisfied
he
assisted
her
to
arise
from
her
tombstone
bundled
the
clerical
lovetokens
back
into
the
bag
duly
placed
captain
jacks
letter
in
the
inner
pocket
and
was
about
to
present
her
with
his
arm
to
conduct
her
homewards
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
little
ragged
urchin
peeping
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
seemingly
in
the
very
act
of
making
a
mysterious
signal
in
the
direction
of
miss
landales
unconscious
figure
rupert
stared
hard
at
the
ruddy
impudent
face
which
instantly
assumed
an
appearance
of
the
most
defiant
unconcern
while
its
owner
began
to
devote
his
energies
to
shying
stones
at
an
invisible
rook
upon
the
old
church
tower
with
great
nicety
of
aim
sophia
said
her
brother
in
a
low
tone
go
to
the
gate
that
boy
wants
to
speak
to
you
go
and
see
what
he
wants
and
return
to
me
miss
landale
gasped
gazed
at
her
brother
as
if
she
thought
him
mad
looked
round
at
the
little
boy
coloured
violently
then
meeting
ruperts
eye
again
staggered
off
without
a
word
of
protest
rupert
shaken
with
silent
laughter
humming
a
little
song
to
himself
stooped
to
pick
a
couple
of
tender
spring
flowers
from
the
border
beside
the
grave
and
after
slipping
them
into
a
buttonhole
of
his
many
caped
overcoat
stood
looking
out
over
the
stretch
of
land
and
sea
where
scarthey
rose
like
a
dream
against
the
sparkle
of
the
water
and
the
exquisite
blue
of
the
sky
presently
rapid
panting
breaths
and
a
shuffling
rustle
of
petticoats
behind
him
informed
him
of
his
sisters
return
so
you
are
there
my
dear

said
loudly
one
of
your
little
fishing
friends
from
the
village

unless
i
am
mistaken
yes
a

i
thought
so
well
shall
we
return
home
now
they
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
us
pray
take
my
arm
then
beneath
his
breath
seeing
that
words
were
struggling
to
sophias
lips
hold
your
tongue
the
small
ragged
boy
watched
their
departure
with
a
derisive
grin
and
set
off
at
a
brisk
canter
down
to
the
shore
jingling
some
silver
coin
in
his
pocket
with
relish
as
he
went
when
rupert
and
sophia
had
reached

wood

it
to
me





a
hasty
scrawl
it
seemed
folded
anyhow
only
two
or
three
lines
yet
rupert
conned
them
for
a
curiously
long
time
my
darling

in

misfortune

he
said
briefly
mention
the
fact
of
the
messenger
having
brought
it
and
then
in
a
terrible
bass
he
added
and
remember
your
oath
she
trembled
but
as
he
walked
onwards
through
the
wood
his
lips
were
smiling
and
his
eyes
were
alight
with
triumph
chapter

the
day
morning
the
appointment
of
a
regular
lightkeeper
at
scarthey
intended
to
release
ren
and
old
margery
from
their
exile
had
been
delayed
so
as
to
suit
the
arrangement
which
was
to
leave
for
a
time
the
island
domain
of
sir
adrian
at
the
disposal
of
captain
jack
meanwhile
moggies
presence
greatly
mitigated
the
severity
of
her
husbands
separation
from
his
master
on
his
side
the
sailor
was
in
radiant
spirits
all
worked
as
he
could
wish
and
sir
adrians
marriage
besides
being
a
source
of
unselfish
satisfaction
was
with
regard
to
his
own
prospects
an
unexpected
help
for
his
expedition
concluded
he
would
now
be
able
in
the
most
natural
manner
to
make
his
appearance
at
pulwick
an
honoured
guest
of
the
master
under
the
pride
of
his
own
name
and
for
the
rest
hope
unfolded
warmcoloured
visions
indeed
during
the
weeks
which
had
elapsed
since
sir
adrians
departure
captain
jacks
visits
to
the
island
had
been
fitful
and
more
or
less
secrethe
always
came
and
left
at
night
but
as
it
was
understood
that
the
place
was
his
to
be
used
and
enjoyed
as
he
thought
best
neither
his
sudden
appearances
with
the
usual
heavy
travellingbag
nor
his
long
absences
excited
any
disturbance
in
the
arcadian
life
led
by
ren
between
his
buxom
young
wife
and
the
old
motheras
the
goodhumoured
husband
now
termed
the
scolding
dame
a
little
sleeping
closet
had
been
prepared
and
allotted
to
the
use
of
the
peripatetic
guest
in
one
of
the
disused
rooms
when
rens
own
accommodation
under
the
light
tower
had
been
enlarged
for
the
new
requirements
of
his
matrimonial
status
and
so
monsieur
the
captain
in
rens
inveterate
outlandish
phraseology
found
his
liberty
of
action
complete
both
the
womens
curiosity
was
allayed
and
all
tendency
to
prying
into
the
young
strangers
mysterious
purposes
amid
their
seclusion
condemned
beforehand
by
rens
statement
that
monsieur
the
captain
was
a
trusted
friend
of
the
masterone
indeed
and
here
the
informant
thought
fit
to
stretch
a
point
if
but
slightly
to
whom
the
lord
of
pulwick
was
indebted
in
bygone
days
for
life
and
freedom
except
when
weatherbound
a
state
of
things
which
at
that
time
of
year
occurred
not
unfrequently
ren
journeyed
daily
as
far
as
the
hall
ostensibly
to
report
progress
and
take
possible
orders
but
really
to
gratify
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
all
was
well
with
the
master
about
the
breakfast
hour
upon
this
15th
of
march
as
sir
adrian
was
discussing
with
the
bailiff
sundry
matters
of
importance
to
the
estate
a
tap
came
to
the
door
which
he
recognised
at
once
as
the
frenchmans
own
long
accustomed
mode
of
selfannouncement
since
he
had
assumed
the
reins
of
government
the
whilom
recluse
had
discovered
that
the
management
of
such
a
wide
property
was
indeed
no
sinecure
and
moreoveras
his
brother
who
certainly
understood
such
matters
in
a
thoroughly
practical
manner
had
warned
himthat
a
person
of
his
own
philosophical
overbenevolent
and
abstracted
turn
of
mind
was
singularly
illfitted
for
the
task
but
a
strong
sense
of
duty
and
a
determination
to
act
by
it
will
carry
a
man
a
long
way
he
had
little
time
for
dreaming
and
this
was
perhaps
a
providential
dispensation
for
sir
adrians
musings
had
now
lost
much
of
the
grave
placidity
born
of
his
long
peaceful
residence
in
his
thelema
of
scarthey
the
task
was
long
and
arduous
on
sundry
occasions
he
was
forced
to
consult
his
predecessor
on
the
arcana
of
landed
estate
government
which
he
did
with
much
simplicity
thereby
giving
mr
landale
not
only
inwardly
mocking
satisfaction
but
several
opportunities
for
the
display
of
his
selfeffacing
loyalty
and
superior
capacities
the
business
of
this
day
was
of
sufficiently
grave
moment
to
make
interruption
unwelcomebeing
nothing
less
than
requests
from
a
number
of
tenants
to
the
good
sir
adrian
the
real
master
come
to
his
own
againfor
a
substantial
reduction
of
rent
a
step
towards
which
the
masters
heart
inclined
but
which
his
sober
reason
condemned
as
preposterous
but
rens
countenance
as
he
entered
betrayed
news
of
such
import
that
sir
adrian
instantly
adjourned
the
matter
on
hand
and
when
the
bailiff
had
retired
anxiously
turned
to
the
newcomer
who
stood
in
the
doorway
mopping
his
steaming
brow
well
renny
said
he
what
is
wrong
nothing
about
your
wife
no
your
honour
answered
the
man
your
honour
is
very
good
nothing
wrong
with
our
moggie
but
the
captain
i
ran
all
the
way
from
the
shearmans
no
accident
there
i
hope
i
fear
there
is
your
honour
the
captainhe
has
been
attacked
this
morning
not
wounded
exclaimed
sir
adrian
not
dead
renny
oh
no
your
honour
well
but
he
has
i
fear
killed
one
of
the
men

the
revenue
men
then
seeing
his
master
start
aghast
he
went
on
rapidly
at
least
he
is
very
badbut
what
for
did
he
come
to
make
the
spy
upon
our
island
we
have
left
him
at
the
shearmansthe
mother
shearman
will
nurse
him
but
the
captain
your
honourthe
speaker
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
advanced
a
step
looking
roundthat
is
the
worst
of
all
the
captain
has
turned
mad
i
believeinstead
of
going
off
with
his
ship
and
his
crew
they
are
safe
out
to
sea
as
they
should
be
he
remains
at
scarthey
yesin
your
honours
rooms
he
is
walking
up
and
down
and
clutching
his
hair
and
talking
to
himself
like
a
possessed
and
when
i
respectfully
begged
him
to
consider
that
it
was
of
the
last
folly
his
having
rested
instead
of
saving
himself
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
reason
a
mule
and
so
knowing
that
your
honour
would
never
forgive
me
if
misfortune
arrived
i
never
drew
breath
till
i
reached
here
to
tell
you
if
his
honour
would
come
himself
he
might
be
able
to
make
mr
his
friend
hear
reasonyour
honour
will
run
no
risk
for
it
is
only
natural
that
you
should
go
to
the
peel
after
what
has
occurredbut
if
you
cannot
get
mr
the
captain
to
depart
this
night
there
will
arrive
to

is
i
who
tell
you
so
i
will
go
back
with
you

perturbed

molly
was
standing
by
the
great
log
fire
in
the
hall
yawning
fit
to
dislocate
her
pretty
jaws
and
teasing
the
inert
form
of
old
jim
as
he
basked
before
the
flame
with
the
tip
of
her
pretty
foot
she
allowed
her
eyes
to
rest
vaguely
upon
her
husband
as
he
approached
but
neither
interrupted
her
idle
occupation
nor
endeavoured
to
suppress
the
yawn
that
again
distended
her
rosy
lips
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
laying
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
said
gently
my
child
i
am
called
back
to
scarthey

leave

may
be

two
or
three
days
lady
landale
raised
her
black
brows
with
a
fine
air
of
interrogation
and
then
gazed
down
at
the
old
dog
till
the
lashes
swept
her
cheek
while
a
mocking
dimple
just
peeped
from
the
corner
of
her
mouth
and
was
gone
again
oh
yes
she
answered
drily
i
shall
take
endless
care
of
myself
and
amuse
myself
wildly
you
need
have
no
fear
of
that
sir
adrian
sighed
and
his
hand
fell
listless
from
her
shoulder
goodbye
then
he
said
and
stooped
it
seemed
hesitatingly
to
lay
his
lips
between
the
little
dark
tendrils
of
hair
that
danced
upon
her
forehead
but
with
a
sudden
movement
she
twitched
her
face
away
despite
all
the
varied
delights
which
bind
me
to
pulwick
she
remarked
carelessly
the
charms
of

and

all
the
other

we
sir
adrians
cheek
flushed
and
with
a
sudden
light
in
his
eyes
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
but
his
countenance
faded
into
instant
melancholy
again
at
sight
of
her
curling
lip
and
cold
amused
gaze
will
you
not

asked

spoke
lightly
i
do
not
want
to
hurry
you
but
i
have
to
leave
at
once
then
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
by
that
longing
to
bring
pleasure
to
others
which
was
always
working
in
him
why
not
let
madeleine
come
with
you
too
he
asked
she
could
share
your
room
andit
would
be
a
pleasure
to
her
i
think
he
sighed
as
he
thought
of
the
trouble
in
store
for
the
lovers
lady
landale
grew
red
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
shot
a
look
of
withering
scorn
at
her
husbands
unconscious
face
it
would
be
charming
she
said
sarcastically
but
after
all
i
dont
know
that
i
care
to
go
so
muchoh
dont
stare
at
me
like
that
for
goodness
sake
a
woman
may
change
her
mind
i
supposeat
least
in
a
trifle
here
and
there
if
she
cant

the
whole
comfort
of
her

and

mon
dieu
i
have
a
husband
in
a
thousand
she
swept
him
a
splendid
curtsey
kissed
her
hand
at
him
and
then
burst
out
laughing
at
the
pale
bewilderment
of
his
face





when
sir
adrian
returned
to
the
morningroom
he
found
ren
half
hidden
behind
the
curtain
folds
peering
curiously
out
of
the
window
which
overlooked
the
avenue
on
his
masters
entrance
the
man
turned
his
head
placed
his
finger
on
his
lip
and
beckoned
him
to
approach
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
said
he
with
subdued
voice
will
his
honour
come
and
look
out
without
showing
himself
and
he
pointed
to
a
group
consisting
of
mr
landale
and
two
men
in
blue
jackets
and
cockaded
hats
of
seminaval
appearance
now
slowly
approaching
the
house
mr
landale
was
listening
with
bent
head
slightly
averted
to
the
smaller
of
his
two
companionsa
stout
squarelooking
fellow
who
spoke
with
evident
volubility
whilst
the
other
followed
defferentially
one
pace
in
rear
presently
the
trio
halted
a
few
yards
from
the
entrance
and
mr
landale
cutting
designs
upon
the
sand
with
the
end
of
his
stick
in
a
meditative
way
appeared
to
be
giving
directions
at
some
length
on
the
conclusion
of
which
the
two
men
touching
their
hats
with
much
respect
departed
together
while
the
magistrate
pensively
proceeded
on
his
way
to
the
house
those
your
honour
said
ren
were
with
him
that
was
struck
in
the
fight
this
morning
it
was
i
rowed
them
over
together
with
the
wounded
i
left
them
at
the
shearmans
and
slipped
away
myself
to
carry
the
news
if
i
might
take
upon
myself
to
advise
it
would
be
better
if
your
honour
would
come
with
me
now
at
once
for
fear
mr
landale
should
delay
us
by
questioning
memr
landale
being
a
magistrate
as
i
heard
these
men
say
and
moggie
has
assured
me
that
he
always
arranges
himself
for
knowing
when
i
arrive
from
the
islandever
since
the
day
when
the
demoiselles
had
just
come
and
i
found
it
out
ever
since
then
he
has
not
liked
me
mr
landale
come
away
your
honour
before
he
finds
out
i
have
been
here
today
following
upon
this
advice
which
he
found
to
the
point
sir
adrian
left
his
house
by
a
back
passage
and
through
a
side
garden
found
his
way
to
the
coast
and
to
the
fishing
village
the
wounded
man
who
had
not
recovered
consciousness
lay
in
the
brother
shearmans
hut
as
ren
had
said
surrounded
by
such
uncouth
attendance
as
the
rude
fisherfolk
could
dispense
after
giving
directions
for
the
summoning
of
medical
aid
and
the
removal
if
it
should
prove
advisable
of
the
patient
to
the
hall
but
without
a
single
comment
upon
the
unfortunate
occurrence
sir
adrian
then
took
the
road
of
the
peel
during
the
transit
walking
rapidly
by
his
masters
side
across
the
now
bare
causeway
ren
gave
his
account
of
events
the
captain
he
related
after
three
days
absence
had
reappeared
the
night
before
the
last
and
requested
him
to
warn
the
womankind
not
to
be
alarmed
if
they
heard
as
no
doubt
they
would
strange
noises
on
the
beach
at
night
he
was
said
he
storing
provisions
and
water
for
the
forthcoming
journey
and
the
water
in
the
well
was
so
excellent
that
he
had
determined
to
take
in
his
store
of
course
his
honour
understood
well
that
ren
did
not
concern
himself
in
these
matters
but
that
was
the
explanation
he
conveyed
to
his
wife
lest
she
should
be
alarmed
and
wonder
as
for
the
old
mother
she
was
too
deaf
to
be
awakened
out
of
sleep
by
anything
short
of
the
trumpet
of
the
last
judgment
as
announced
there
had
been
during
the
night
the
noise
of
a
party
of
men
landing
of
the
hoisting
and
rolling
of
barrelsa
great
remuemnage
altogetherand
the
next
morning
that
was
yesterday
the
captain
had
slept
sound
in
his
bunk
till
late
during
several
hours
of
the
following
day
he
had
some
secret
work
to
do
in
the
caves
of
which
ren
had
shown
the
ins
and
outs
and
whilst
so
engaged
had
requested
that
watch
should
be
kept
from
the
lighttower
and
message
sent
by
some
arranged
signal
should
any
one
approach
the
island
but
no
one
had
come
near
whilst
at
his
post
the
watcher
had
heard
at
different
times
the
sound
of
hammering
and
when
the
captain
had
come
to
relieve
him
the
good
gentleman
was
much
begrimed
with
dust
and
hot
with
work
but
appeared
in
excellent
humour
in
the
castle
he
sang
and
whistled
for
joyfulness
and
made
jokes
with
moggie
all
in
his
kind
way
saying
that
if
he
were
not
to
be
married
himself
soon
he
would
feel
quite
indignant
and
jealous
at
the
happiness
of
such
a
rascal
as
her
husband
oh
he
was
happymonsieur
the
captainhe
had
brought
moggie
a
beautiful
shawl
and
to
ren
he
had
given
a
splendid
watch
telling
him
to
keep
count
of
the
hours
of
his
unmerited
bliss
alas
this
morning
all
had
been
different
indeed
the
captain
looked
another
man
his
face
was
as
white
as
linen
the
very
look
of
him
would
have
told
any
one
that
a
misfortune
had
occurred
ren
did
not
quite
understand
it
himself
but
this
is
what
had
taken
place
the
captain
had
left
scarthey
on
foot
late
in
the
evening
and
when
he
returned
he
was
not
long
away
he
bade
ren
again
not
to
mind
what
he
heard
during
the
night
and
in
faith
once
more
there
had
been
a
real
noise
of
the
devil
men
coming
to
and
fro
a
deal
of
rowing
on
the
water
away
and
back
again
in
the
early
night
and
then
once
more
before
dawn
but
i
was
not
unquiet
said
ren
i
knew
they
had
come
for
the
remainder
of
what
mr
smith
was
pleased
to
call
his
provisions
from
our
room
i
could
see
by
the
light
on
the
stairs
that
the
lamp
was
burning
well
and
moggie
slept
like
a
child
so
sound
she
never
moved
just
before
the
rising
sun
i
had
got
up
and
put
out
the
lamp
and
was
going
to
bed
again
when
there
came
thumps
of
the
devil
at
the
lower
door
well
knowing
that
the
captain
had
his
own
way
of
enteringfor
he
had
spent
many
days
in
finding
out
all
sorts
of
droll
passages
in
the
ruinsi
was
quite
seized
and
as
i
hurried
down
the
thumps
came
again
and
great
cries
for
the
lighthousekeeper
and
your
honour
when
i
unbarred
the
door
there
was
a
man
in
uniform
whom
i
did
not
know
and
he
asked
me
grumbling
if
i
knew
of
the
pretty
doings
on
the
beach
whilst
i
slept
like
pig
he
saidof
course
i
made
the
astonished
as
his
honour
may
imagine
i
knew
nothing
had
heard
nothing
though
my
heart
was
beating
like
to
burst
not
knowing
what
was
coming
then
he
ordered
me
to
lend
a
hand
and
bring
a
ladder
to
carry
away
one
of
his
men
who
had
been
murdered
by
the
smugglers
he
said
and
there
on
the
sands
in
front
of
the
small
cave
was
another
man
in
a
blue
coat
too
watching
over
the
body
of
one
who
was
stretched
out
quite
tranquil
his
face
covered
with
blood
and
his
eyes
closed
they
are
gone
says
the
gross
man
and
i
was
glad
as
your
honour
may
well
think
to
see
the
chaloupe
full
of
the
captains
men
rowing
hard
towards
the
vessel
she
had
just
come
out
of
the
river
mouth
and
was
doubling
round
the
banks
we
carried
the
man
on
his
ladder
to
the
kitchen
and
we
and
the
women
did
all
we
could
but
he
remained
like
a
log
so
after
a
time
the
two
men
who
said
they
had
come
along
the
dyke
soon
after
midnight
on
foot
as
they
thought
it
would
be
more
secret
and
had
watched
all
night
in
the
bent
wanted
to
eat
and
drink
and
rest
they
had
missed
their
game
the
big
man
said
they
had
been
sent
to
find
out
what
sort
of
devils
tricks
were
being
played
on
in
the
island
unbeknown
to
sir
adrianbut
it
was
the
devils
luck
altogether
for
the
smugglers
had
slipped
away
and
would
not
be
seen
in
this
part
of
the
world
again
that
is
the
way
the
fat
man
spoke
the
other
had
nothing
to
say
but
swallowed
our
bacon
and
our
beer
as
if
he
did
not
care
and
then
your
honour
they
told
me
i
should
have
to
lend
them
the
yawl
to
go
on
land
and
go
myself
to
help
and
take
the
body
with
us
and
as
he
was
speaking
i
saw
moggie
the
wife
who
had
been
backwards
and
forwards
serving
them
looking
at
me
very
straight
but
without
blowing
a
word
as
if
she
had
fear
and
all
at
once
i
felt
there
was
something
on
foot
so
i
drew
the
men
more
beer
and
said
i
would
see
after
the
yawl
outside
the
door
the
wife
whispered
upstairs
quick
renny
and
she
herself
whisked
back
into
the
kitchen
so
that
she
should
not
cause
suspicion
to
those
othersah
your
honour
that
is
a
woman
well
well
interrupted
his
master
anxiously
well
i
went
upstairs
four
by
four
and
there
in
your
honours
room
without
an
attempt
to
conceal
himself
when
any
moment
it
might
have
entered
into
those
brigands
heads
downstairs
to
search
the
place
there
was
monsieur
the
captain
raging
up
and
down
like
a
wolf
in
cage
as
i
had
the
honour
to
describe
before
no
wonder
moggie
was
afraid
for
him
a
woman
is
quick
to
feel
danger
ahead
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
did
not
know
me
his
face
all
unmade
you
know
what
has
happened
he
says
am
i
not
the
most
unfortunate
all
is
lost
with
respect
says
i
nothing
is
lost
so
long
as
life
is
safe
but
it
is
not
a
good
thing
monsieur
the
captain
that
you
are
here
like
this
when
you
should
be
on
your
good
ship
as
many
miles
away
as
she
can
make
are
you
mad
to
him
i
say
and
he
to
me
i
think
i
am
at
least
let
me
hide
you
i
beg
of
him
i
know
of
many
beautiful
places
and
so
for
the
matter
of
that
does
he
but
it
was
all
lost
trouble
at
length
he
sits
down
at
the
table
and
begins
to
write
and
his
look
brightens
you
can
help
me
my
good
friend
he
says
i
have
a
hope
leftwho
knowswho
knowsand
he
writes
a
few
lines
like
an
enraged
and
folds
them
and
kisses
the
billet
find
means
says
he
ren
to
get
johnny
the
shearman
boy
to
take
this
to
the
old
churchyard
and
place
it
in
the
place
he
knows
of
or
better
still
should
he
chance
upon
miss
landale
to
give
it
to
her
he
is
a
sharp
rogue
says
he
and
i
can
trust
his
wits
but
should
you
not
find
him
dear
ren
you
must
do
the
commission
for
me
yourself
now
gogo
he
cries
and
pushes
me
to
the
stairs
and
as
i
dared
remain
no
more
i
had
to
leave
him
of
course
monsieur
the
captain
has
not
been
here
all
this
time
without
telling
me
of
his
hopes
and
it
is
clear
that
it
is
to
bid
farewell
to
mademoiselle
madeleine
that
he
is
playing
with
his
life
it
is
as
ill
reasoning
with
a
lover
as
a
lunatic
they
are
the
same
thing
ma
foi
but
i
trust
to
your
honour
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
if
any
one
can
and
so
to
continue
i
went
down
and
i
told
the
men
in
blue
the
boat
was
ready
we
carried
the
body
i
left
them
at
the
shearmans
as
your
honour
knows
i
found
johnny
and
gave
him
the
letter
he
knew
all
about
what
to
do
it
seemed
and
then
i
came
straight
to
the
hall
it
is
indeed
a
miserable
business
said
sir
adrian
ren
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
sympathy
as
he
noticed
the
increasing
concern
on
his
masters
face
you
heard
them
mention
my
brothers
name
inquired
the
latter
after
following
the
train
of
his
misgivings
for
a
few
moments
you
have
reason
to
think
that
mr
landale
knew
of
these
mens
errand
other
reason
i
mean
than
having
seen
them
with
him
just
now
rens
quick
mind
leaped
at
the
meaning
of
the
question
yes
your
honour
mr
landale
will
want
to
know
of
this
says
the
fat
one
though
it
is
too
late
he
says
and
ren
added
ruefully
i
have
great
fear
the
captain
is
not
at
the
end
of
his
pains
if
mr
landale
is
ranged
against
him
such
was
also
sir
adrians
thought
but
he
walked
on
for
a
time
in
silence
and
having
reached
scarthey
rapidly
made
his
way
into
the
peel
captain
jack
was
still
pacing
the
room
much
as
ren
had
described
when
sir
adrian
entered
upon
him
the
young
man
turned
with
a
transient
look
of
surprise
to
the
newcomer
then
waved
away
the
proffered
hand
with
a
bitter
smile
you
do
not
know
he
said
who
it
is
you
would
shake
hands
withan
outlawa
criminal
ah
you
have
heard
then
renny
i
suppose
has
told
you
yes
groaned
the
other
holding
his
friend
by
both
shoulders
and
gazing
sorrowfully
into
the
haggard
face
the
man
may
dieoh
jack
jack
how
could
you
be
so
rash
i
cant
say
how
it
all
happened
answered
captain
jack
falling
to
his
walk
to
and
fro
again
in
the
extremity
of
his
distress
and
ever
and
anon
mopping
his
brow
i
felt
such
security
in
this
place
all
was
loaded
but
the
last
barrel
when
all
of
a
sudden
from
god
knows
where
the
man
sprang
on
me
and
thrust
his
dark
lantern
in
my
face
it
is
smith
i
heard
him
say
i
do
believe
now
that
he
only
wanted
to
identify
me
no
man
in
his
senses
could
have
dared
to
try
and
arrest
me
surrounded
by
my
six
men
but
i
had
no
time
to
think
then
adrian
i
imagined
the
fellow
was
leading
a
general
attack
if
that
last
barrel
was
seized
the
whole
secret
was
out
and
that
meant
ruin
wholesale
failure
seemed
to
menace
me
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
my
success
i
had
a
handspike
in
my
hand
with
which
i
had
been
helping
to
roll
the
kegs
i
struck
with
it
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
man
went
down
on
the
spot
with
a
groan
as
he
fell
i
leaped
back
ready
for
the
next
i
called
out
stretchers
lads
they
want
to
take
your
captain
my
lads
gathered
round
me
at
once
but
there
was
silence
not
another
creature
to
be
seen
or
heard
they
set
to
work
to
get
that
last
blessed
bit
of
cargo
the
cause
of
all
the
misery
on
board
with
the
rest
while
i
stood
in
the
growing
dawn
looking
down
at
the
motionless
figure
and
at
the
blood
trickling
into
the
sand
trying
to
think
to
settle
what
to
do
and
only
conscious
of
one
thing
the
intense
wish
that
i
could
change
places
with
my
victim
can
you
wonder
adrian
that
my
brain
was
reeling
you
who
know
all
all
this
means
to
me
can
you
wonder
that
i
could
not
leave
this
shoreeven
though
my
life
depended
on
itwithout
seeing
her
again
curwen
my
mate
came
up
to
me
at
last
and
i
woke
up
to
some
sort
of
reason
at
the
idea
that
they
the
crew
and
the
ship
must
be
removed
from
the
immediate
danger
but
the
orders
i
gave
must
have
seemed
those
of
a
madman
i
told
him
to
sail
right
away
but
to
double
back
in
time
to
have
the
schooner
round
again
at
twelve
noon
today
and
then
to
send
the
gigs
crew
to
pick
me
up
on
pulwick
sand
life
and
death
said
i
to
him
and
he
brave
fellow
ay
ay
sir
as
if
it
was
the
most
simple
thing
in
the
world
and
off
with
him
without
another
word
what
imprudence
what
imprudence
murmured
sir
adrian
who
knows
none
will
believe
that
i
have
not
seized
the
opportunity
of
making
my
escape
with
the
others
the
height
of
imprudence
may
become
the
height
of
security
i
have
as
yet
no
planbut
it
will
come
my
luck
shall
not
fail
me
now
who
knows
nothing
perhaps
is
damaged
but
an
excise
mans
crown
thank
heaven
the
wind
cannot
fail
us
today
but
meanwhile
urged
sir
adrian
quite
unconvinced
highly
disturbed
that
treasure
on
board
i
know
what
has
been
your
motive
jack
but
indeed
it
is
all
nothing
short
of
insanity
positive
insanity
can
you
trust
your
men
i
would
trust
them
with
my
own
secrets
willingly
enough
but
not
with
those
of
other
people
so
they
do
not
know
what
i
have
in
those
barrels
four
thousand
golden
guineas
in
each
no
the
temptation
would
be
too
terrible
for
the
poor
lads
not
a
soul
knows
that
beyond
you
and
me
curwen
has
charge
of
the
cargo
such
as
it
is
but
i
can
answer
for
it
none
of
them
will
dream
of
tampering
with
the
casks
they
are
picked
men
sober
trusty
who
have
fought
side
by
side
with
me
i
am
their
best
friend
they
are
mine
body
and
soul
i
believe
they
do
know
there
is
some
risk
in
the
business
but
they
trust
me
they
are
sure
of
treble
pay
and
besides
are
not
troubled
with
squeamishness
as
for
curwen
he
would
go
to
hell
for
me
and
never
ask
a
question
no
adrian
the
scheme
was
perfect
but
for
this
cursed
blow
of
mine
this
morning
and
now
it
is
a
terrible
responsibility
continued
the
young
man
again
wiping
his
forehead
every
ounce
of
it
weighs
on
my
shoulders
but
it
is
not
that
that
distracts
me
oh
adrian

madeleine
the
elder
man
felt
his
heart
contract
at
the
utter
despairing
of
that
cry
when
my
handspike
crashed
on
that
damned
interferers
skull
the
sailor
went
on
i
felt
as
if
the
blow
had
opened
an
unfathomable
chasm
between
her
and
me
now
i
am
felonyes
in
law
a
felon
and
yet
i
am
the
same
man
as
yesterday
i
shall
have
to
fly
tonight
and
may
never
be
able
to
return
openly
to
england
again
all
my
golden
dreams
of
happiness
of
honour
vanished
at
the
sound
of
that
cursed
blow
but
i
must
see
her
adrian
i
must
see
her
before
i
go
i
am
going
to
meet
her
at
noon
in
the
ruins
of
pulwick
impossible
ejaculated
the
other
aghast
listen
jack
unfortunate
man
when
i
heard
of
thethe
misfortune
and
of
your
folly
in
remaining
i
instantly
planned
a
last
meeting
for
you
as
it
fell
out
my
wife
has
a
fancy
to
spend
the
night
here
i
have
asked
her
to
bring
her
sister
with
her
but
this
inconceivably
desperate
plan
of
leaving
in
your
ship
in
broad
light
of
day
frustrates
all
i
would
have
done
for
you
for
gods
sake
let
us
contrive
some
way
of
warning
the
peregrine
off
till
midnight
keep
hidden
yourself
do
not
wilfully
run
your
head
into
the
noose
but
the
young
man
had
stopped
short
in
his
tramping
and
stood
looking
at
his
friend
with
a
light
of
hope
flaming
in
his
eye
you
have
done
that
adrian
you
have
thought
of
that
he
repeated
as
if
mechanically
a
new
whirlwind
of
schemes
rushed
through
his
mind
for
a
while
he
remained
motionless
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
sir
adrian
putting
order
in
his
own
thoughts
with
that
genius
of
precision
and
swiftness
which
in
strong
natures
rises
to
meet
a
crisis
then
advancing
and
seizing
him
by
both
hands
adrian
he
cried
in
something
more
like
his
own
voice
again
i
shall
yet
owe
my
happiness
to
you
to
this
thought
this
sublime
thought
of
your
heart
and
as
sir
adrian
astounded
unable
to
understand
this
extremity
of
hopefulness
following
upon
the
previous
depth
of
misery
stared
back
at
him
speechless
the
latter
proceeded
in
still
more
surprising
fashion
now
you
listen
to
me
this
time
i
have
been
selfish
in
running
the
risk
of
having
you
mixed
up
in
my
dangerous
affairs
but
god
is
my
witness
i
acted
under
the
belief
that
all
was
absolutely
secure
now
however
you
must
do
nothing
more
that
might
implicate
you
remember
do
nothing
to
let
people
suspect
that
you
have
seen
me
today
renny
too
must
keep
close
counsel
you
know
nothing
of
my
future
movements
remain
here
for
a
while
do
not
even
look
out
of
the
window
i
fear
we
shall
not
meet
for
a
long
time
meanwhile
god
bless
yougod
bless
you
after
another
wrench
of
the
hands
he
held
in
his
the
sailor
released
them
and
fairly
ran
out
of
the
room
without
heeding
his
friends
bewildered
expostulations
at
the
door
of
the
keep
he
met
ren
again
and
after
a
brief
but
earnest
colloquy
the
man
whose
life
was
now
forfeit
to
the
community
and
upon
whose
head
there
would
soon
be
a
price
was
quietly
walking
along
the
causeway
making
for
the
shore
with
the
greatest
apparent
unconcern
and
deliberation
and
whilst
sir
adrian
alone
in
his
chamber
with
his
head
resting
upon
his
hand
anxiously
pondered
upon
the
possible
issues
of
this
nefarious
days
doings
the
sailor
advanced
in
broad
daylight
towards
the
land
to
keep
his
appointment





a
solitary
speck
of
life
upon
the
great
waste
with
the
consciousness
of
the
precarious
thread
of
chance
upon
which
it
hung
what
wonder
that
for
all
his
daring
the
traveller
felt
as
he
deliberately
regulated
his
pace
to
the
most
nonchalant
gait
a
frantic
desire
to
run
forward
or
to
lie
down
how
many
approach
glasses
might
now
be
laid
like
so
many
guns
upon
him
from
secret
points
of
the
coast
until
he
came
within
range
of
recognition
what
ambushes
those
clumps
of
gorse
and
juniper
those
plantations
of
alders
and
young
firs
on
the
bluffs
yonder
might
conceal
the
eye
could
reach
far
and
wide
upon
the
immense
stretch
of
sand
along
the
desert
coast
and
his
solitary
figure
moving
upon
the
yellow
strand
was
a
mark
for
miles
around
steadily
nevertheless
did
he
advance
the
very
daring
the
unpardonable
foolhardiness
of
the
deed
his
safety
and
yet
the
strain
was
high
were
they
watching
the
island
among
the
eager
crew
to
each
of
whom
the
capture
might
mean
a
splendid
prize
and
chance
of
promotion
was
there
one
would
have
the
genius
of
suddenly
suspecting
that
this
foolhardy
wayfarer
might
be
the
man
they
wanted
and
not
merely
sir
adrian
returning
on
foot
towards
his
home
and
then
came
the
answer
of
hopeful
youth
and
hardy
courage
no
the
preventive
are
a
lubberly
lotit
will

something
better

but
for
all
his
assurance
lucky
jack
smith
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
he
felt
the
shadow
of
pulwick
woods
closing
around
him
at
last
chapter
xxiii
the
day
noon
there
stood
two
men
and
they
did
point
their
fingers
at
that
house
and
on
his
finger
one
had
blood
the
others
finger
shook
luteplayers
song
broken
lengths
of
wall
a
crumbling
indication
of
the
spring
of
once
exquisite
arches
windows
gaping
darkly
like
the
eye
sockets
of
a
skullthis
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
old
priory
of
pulwick
whilom
proud
seat
of
clerical
power
and
learning
but
the
image
of
decay
was
robbed
of
all
melancholy
by
the
luxuriance
of
climbing
vegetation
by
the
living
screen
of
noble
firs
and
larches
arranged
in
serried
ranks
upon
the
slopes
immediately
behind
it
with
here
and
there
a
rugged
sentinel
within
the
ruinous
yards
and
rooms
themselves
by
wild
bushes
of
juniper
and
gorse
and
brambles
and
with
the
bright
noon
sun
pouring
down
upon
the
worn
red
sandstone
and
gilding
the
delicate
tassels
of
the
larches
green
needles
with
the
light
of
young
love
spreading
glamour
upon
every
leaf
and
stone
in
the
eyes
of
the
lovers
the
scene
witness
of
so
many
sweet
meetings
bore
that
day
a
beautiful
and
homelike
aspect
captain
jack
was
standing
upon
the
grassgrown
floor
of
what
had
been
the
departed
monks
refectory
with
ears
eagerly
bent
to
listen
three
ragged
walls
a
clump
of
fir
trees
and
a
bank
of
brambles
screened
him
from
any
chance
passerby
and
he
now
and
again
peered
through
a
crevice
on
to
a
path
through
the
woods
cautiously
as
if
fearful
to
venture
forth
his
face
was
pale
beneath
its
tan
and
had
none
of
its
usual
brightness
his
attire
for
him
was
disordered
his
whole
appearance
that
of
a
man
under
the
pressure
of
doubt
and
anxiety
yet
when
the
sound
of
a
light
footfall
struck
among
the
thousand
whispering
noises
of
wind
and
leaf
that
went
to
make
up
the
silence
of
the
ruins
the
glory
of
joy
that
lit
up
eye
and
lip
left
no
room
for
any
other
impression
madeleine
stood
in
the
old
doorway
a
vision
of
beautiful
life
amid
emblems
of
decay
and
death
i
come
alone
today
she
said
with
her
halfshy
smile
and
then
before
she
could
utter
a
further
word
of
explanation
she
was
gathered
into
her
lovers
strong
arms
with
a
passion
he
had
never
as
yet
shown
in
his
chivalrous
relations
with
her
but
it
was
not
because
they
met
without
the
sympathetic
rapture
of
miss
landales
eye
upon
them
not
because
there
was
no
other
witnesses
but
the
dangling
ivy
wreath
the
stern
old
walls
the
fine
dome
of
spring
sky
faintly
blue
not
because
of
lovers
audacious
joy
this
madeleine
feeling
the
stormy
throbbing
of
his
heart
against
hers
knew
with
sure
instinct
she
pushed
him
gently
from
her
as
soon
as
she
could
the
blushes
chased
from
her
cheeks
by
pale
misgivings
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
troubled
questioning
then
he
spoke
from
his
full
heart
madeleine
something

happeneda
misfortune

i
wrote

tracked

aroused

she
hung
upon
his
hot
words
looking
at
him
with
loving
frightened
eyes
now
he
gathered
her
to
his
arms
again
again
his
bursting
heart
throbbed
its
stormy
passion
to
her
ear
she
was
as
one
carried
away
by
a
torrent
against
which
resistance
is
useless
he
bent
his
head
over
her
face
the
scent
of
the
bunch
of
violets
in
her
breast
rose
deliciously
to
his
nostrils
alas
hubert
cochrane
was
not
to
reach
that
kiss
of
acquiescence
that
kiss
from
which
it
seemed
that
but
so
small
a
fraction
of
space
and
time
divided
him
some
one
who
had
stepped
along
in
the
shadow
as
silently
as
a
cat
coming
upon
a
bird
clapped
here
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
who
are
you
sir
and
what
do
you
want
exclaimed
captain
jack
wrenching
himself
free
falling
back
a
pace
and
measuring
the
newcomer
from
head
to
foot
with
furious
glances
while
with
burning
blushes
madeleine
faltered
rupert
nothing
awakens
anger
in
hot
blood
sooner
than
an
unsanctioned
touch
in
certain
moods
the
merest
contact
is
as
infuriating
as
a
blow
such
an
insult
added
to
the
irreparable
injury
of
interrupting
their
meeting
at
the
most
exquisite
and
crucial
moment
drove
captain
jack
beside
himself
with
rage
but
madeleines
hand
was
still
on
his
arm
she
felt
it
suddenly
harden
and
twitch
with
murderous
anger
but
by
an
effort
that
made
the
veins
of
his
temple
swell
like
whipcord
he
refrained
from
striking
the
double
offender
mr
landale
surveyed
the
pair
for
a
moment
in
silence
with
his
grave
look
then
coldly
he
answered
the
sailors
irate
speech
my
name
fellow
is
rupert
landale
i
am
here
to
protect
my
cousin
from
an
unprincipled
and
criminal
adventurer
you
take
a
sharp
tone
sir
cried
captain
jack
the
flush
on
his
face
deepening
yet
a
shade
his
nostrils
ominously
dilated
yet
speaking
without
further
loss
of
selfcontrol
you
probably
count
upon
the
presence
of
this
lady
to
prevent
my
resenting
it
but
as
my
time
with
her
is
short
and
i
have
still
much
to
say
i
shall
be
forced
promptly
to
eject
you
from
the
ruins
here
unless
you
will
be
good
enough
to
immediately
remove
yourself
i
shall
hope
for
another
meeting
with
you
to
discuss
the
question
as
to
your
right
of
interference
but
todayi
cannot
spare
the
time
rupert
smiled
without
moving
then
the
sailor
gently
disengaging
himself
from
madeleine
would
have
put
her
behind
him
but
that
she
pressed
forward
and
laid
a
hand
upon
an
arm
of
each
of
the
men
stay
jack
she
pleaded
let
me
speak
there
is
some
mistake
here
cousin
rupert
you
cannot
know
that
i
am
engaged
to
this
gentleman
and
that
he
is
a
friend
of
your
brothers
as
well
as
of
other
good
friends
of
mine
my
poor
child
answered
rupert
closing
a
cold
hand
gently
over
hers
and
speaking
with
a
most
delicate
tenderness
of
accent
you
have
been
grossly
imposed
upon
and
so
have
others
as
for
my
poor
brother
adrian
he
is
if
anything
easier
to
deceive
than
you
innocent
conventbred
girl
i
would
have
you
to
go
home
my
dear
and
leave
me
to
deal
with
thisgentleman
you
have
bitter
truths
to
learn
would
it
not
be
better
to
wait
and
learn
them
quietly
without
further
scandal
this
was
too
much
for
captain
jack
who
fairly
ground
his
teeth
ruperts
honeyed
tones
his
grasp
of
madeleines
hand
were
more
unbearable
even
than
the
words
he
advanced
upon
the
elder
man
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
whirled
him
away
from
the
girl
as
easily
as
a
straw
puppet
the
fine
gentleman
of
sensitive
nerves
and
unworked
sinews
had
no
chance
against
the
iron
strength
of
the
man
who
had
passed
all
the
years
of
virility
fighting
against
sea
and
storm
the
two
faced
each
other
jack
smith
red
and
panting
with
honest
rage
only
the
sense
of
his
ladys
proximity
keeping
him
from
carrying
his
highhanded
measures
a
little
further
mr
landale
livid
with
eyes
suddenly
black
in
their
orbits
moistening
his
white
lips
while
he
quivered
from
head
to
foot
with
a
passion
so
tense
that
not
even
his
worst
enemy
could
have
attributed
it
to
fear
an
unequal
match
it
would
seem
yet
unequal
in
a
way
that
the
young
man
in
the
conscious
glory
of
his
strength
could
not
have
conceived
madeleine
neither
screamed
nor
fainted
she
had
grown
white
in
natural
apprehension
but
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
lovers
face
shone
with
admiration
mr
landale
turned
slowly
towards
her
madeleine
he
said
readjusting
his
stock
and
smoothing
the
folds
of
his
collar
with
a
steadfast
striving
after
coolness
you
have
been
grossly
deceived
the
man
you
would
trust
with
your
life
and
honour
is
a
mere
smuggler
he
has
no
doubt
told
you
fine
stories

packed
with

he
has
attacked
and
wounded
an
officer
who
in

gazed
from

to
the

her
mind
never
a
very
quick
one
at
decision
was
too
bewildered
to
act
with
clearness
moreover
with
her
education
and
ignorance
of
the
world
the
indictment
conveyed
no
special
meaning
to
her
but
there
was
an
agony
of
suspense
and
beseeching
in
the
glance
that
her
lover
cast
upon
her
and
to
that
appeal
she
smiled
proudly

she
felt

its
confidence
shaken
by
the
slandering
of
anger
then
the
thought
of
his
danger
danger
admitted
by
his
own
lips
flashed
upon

with
terror
she
rushed
to
him
oh
go
jack
goas
you

go
mr
landale
who
had
already
once
or
twice
cast
impatient
looks
of
expectation
through
a
window
of
the
east
wall
taken
by
surprise
at
this
unforeseen
result
of
his
speech
suddenly
climbed
up
upon
a
broken
piece
of
stonework
from
which
there
was
an
abrupt
descent
towards
the
shore
and
began
to
signal
in
eager
gesticulation
there
was
a
sound
of
heavy
running
footfalls
without
captain
jack
raised
his
head
every
nerve
on
the
alert
go
go
again
cried
madeleine
dreading
she
knew
not
whata
fat
panting
red
face
looked
over
the
wall
mr
landale
turned
for
a
second
to
throw
at
the
lovers
a
glance
of
elation
but
it
seemed
as
if
the
sailors
spirits
rose
at
the
breath
of
danger
he
rapidly
looked
round
upon
the
ruins
from
which
there
were
no
other
outlets
than
the
window
guarded
by
mr
landale
and
the
doorway
in
which
the
redfaced
newcomer
now
stood
framed
in
red
stone
then
like
a
cat
he
darted
on
to
the
ledge
of
the
wall
at
the
opposite
end
where
some
invading
boughs
of
larch
dropped
over
the
jagged
crest
before
the
burly
figure
in
the
blue
coat
of
the
preventive
service
had
recovered
from
the
surprise
of
finding
a
lady
in
his
way
or
gathered
his
wits
and
his
breath
sufficiently
to
interfere
there
the
nimble
climber
stood
a
moment
balancing
himself
lightly
though
the
ivied
stones
rocked
beneath
him
i
go
love
he
cried
in
ringing
voice
but
one
word
from
you
and
i
go
oh
i
trust
you
i
will
trust
you
screamed
the
girl
in
despair
while
her
fascinated
gaze
clung
to
the
erect
figure
silhouetted
against
the
sky
and
the
stout
man
looked
up
openmouthed
mr
landale
snarled
at
him
shoot
foolshoot
and
straining
forward
himself
drew
a
pistol
from
the
mans
belt
cocked
it
and
thrust
it
into
his
grasp
captain
jack
kissed
his
hand
to
madeleine
with
a
joyful
gesture
then
waved
his
hat
defiantly
in
ruperts
direction
and
with
a
spring
disappeared
just
as
the
pistol
cracked
drawing
a
shriek
of
terror
from
the
girl
and
its
bullet
flattened
itself
against
the
upper
stone
of
the
wallconsiderably
wide
of
the
mark
come
this
way
screamed
mr
landale
from
his
window
sill
you
have
another
but
the
preventive
shook
his
head
and
thrust
his
smoking
barrel
back
through
his
belt
with
an
air
of
philosophical
resignation
and
slowly
approaching
the
window
through
which
the
fugitive
could
now
be
seen
steadily
bowling
down
the
seaward
slope
observed
in
slow
fat
tones
give
you
a
hand
sir
rupert
thrusting
his
extended
arm
aside
jumped
down
beside
him
as
if
he
would
have
sprung
at
his
throat
why
are
you
so
latewhy
have
you
brought
no
one
with
you
i
gave
you
notice
enough
you
fool
you
have
let
him
slip
through
your
fingers
now
after
all
couldnt
you
even
shoot
straight
such
a
mark
as
he
made
against
the
skypah
well
may
the
sailors
say
lubberly
as
a
land
preventive
why
there
you
are
mr
landale
answered
the
man
with
imperturbable
greasy
goodhumour
the
way
you
shoved
that
there
pistol
into
my
hand
was
enough
to
put
off
anybody
but
you
country
magistrate
gentlemen
as
i
have
always
said
you
are
the
real
sort
to
make
one
do
illegal
actions
with
your
flurry
and
your
hurry
over
everything
shoot
says
you
and
damme
sir
if
i
didnt
shoot
straight
off
before
i
knew
if
i
were
on
my
head
or
on
my
heels
its
a
mercy
i
didnt
hit
the
sweet
young
ladyit
is
indeed
and
as
for
the
young
gentleman
though
to
be
sure
he
did
show
a
clean
pair
of
heels
at
the
sight
of
me
i
had
no
proper
time
for
identificationno
time
for
identification
mr
landale
sir
so
i
say
sir
its
a
mercy
i
did
not
hit
him
either
now
i
can
think
of
it
ah
slow
and
sure
thats
my
motter
i
takes
my
man
on
his
boat
in
the
very
middle
of
his
laces
and
his
brandy
and
his
silki
takes
him
sir
in
the
very
act
of
illegality
redhanded
so
to
speak
and
then
if
he
shows
fight
or
if
he
runs
away
then
i
shoots
sir
and
then
if
i
hits
why
its
a
good
job
toobut
none
of
this
promiscuous
work
for
augustus
hobson
slow
and
sure
thats
my
motter
the
speaker
who
had
been
rolling
a
quid
of
tobacco
in
his
mouth
during
this
exposition
of
policy
here
spat
emphatically
upon
the
grass
and
catching
madeleines
abstracted
eye
begged
pardon
for
the
liberty
with
a
gallant
air
aye
so
slow
man
that
you
are
pretty
sure
to
fail
muttered
mr
landale
i
knows
my
business
sir
meaning
no
offence
retorted
mr
hobson
serenely
when
i
has
no
orders
i
acts
on
regulation
i
brought
no
one
with
me
because
i
had
no
one
to
bring
having
sent
as
per
regulation
my
one
remaining
man
to
give
notice
to
the
water
service
seeing
that
that
there
schooner
has
had
the
impudence
to
come
back
and
is
at
this
very
moment
cruising
quite
happylike
just
the
other
side
of
the
bank
though
if
ever
their
cutter
overhauls
herwell
im
a
dutchman
you
might
have
done
wiser
perhaps
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
remark
to
leave
the
management
of
this
business
to
them
as
understands
such
things
as
to
being
late
sir
you
told
me
to
be
in
the
ruins
at
twelve
noon
and
i
beg
to
insinuate
that
its
only
just
past
the
hour
now
at
this
point
the
preventive
man
drew
from
his
capacious
breeches
a
brass
timepiece
of
congenial
stoutness
the
face
of
which
he
turned
towards
the
magistrate
the
latter
however
waved
the
proffered
witness
impatiently
aside
furtively
watching
his
cousin
who
leaning
against
the
doorpost
her
pale
head
thrown
out
in
strong
relief
by
the
dark
stones
stood
as
if
absolutely
detached
from
her
surroundings
communing
over
troubled
thoughts
with
her
own
soul
he
said
with
deliberate
distinctness
but
have
i
been
misled
then
in
understanding
that
you
were
with
the
unfortunate
officer
who
was
so
ferociously
assaulted
this
morning
that
you
and
he
did
come
upon
this
captain
smith
redhanded
as
you
call
it
loading
or
unloading
his
vessel
on
scarthey
island
aye
sir
rolled
out
the
other
unctuously
there
you
are
again
you
see
poor
nat
beavor
he
was
one
of
your
hotheaded
ones
and
see
what
it
has
brought
him
toa
crack
in
his
skull
sir
so
that
it
will
be
days
before
hell
know
himself
again
the
doctor
says
if
ever
he
does
in
this
world
which
i
dont
think
ah
i
says
to
him
when
we
started
in
the
dawn
this
morning
agreeable
to
our
arrangement
with
you
for
peeping
and
prying
on
the
quiet
without
any
running
risks
and
provoking
others
to
break
the
law
more
than
theyre
doing
im
your
man
says
i
but
as
for
attacking
desperate
individles
without
proper
warrant
and
authority
not
to
speak
of
being
one
to
ten
i
tell
you
fair
nat
beavor
ill
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
nat
he
went
off
his
head
clean
at
the
sight
of
captain
jack
and
his
men
a
trundling
the
little
kegs
down
the
sands
as
neat
and
tidy
as
could
be
and
so
he
cut
out
from
behind
the
rocks
and
i
knew
there
was
mischief
ahead
ah
poor
fellow
if
he
would
only
have
listened
to
me
i
did
my
best
for
him
sir
started
off
to
call
up
the
other
man
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
ruins
as
soon
as
i
saw
his
danger
but
when
i
came
back
the
birds
were
flown
of
course
interrupted
rupert
with
a
sneer
and
you
found
the
body
of
your
comrade
who
had
been
dastardly
wounded
and
who
i
hear
is
dead
now
so
the
villain
has
twice
escaped
you
cousin
madeleine
hastily
breaking
off
to
advance
to
the
girl
who
now
awakening
from
her
reflective
mood
seemed
about
to
leave
the
ruins
cousin
madeleine
are
you
going
let
me
escort
you
back
she
slowly
turned
her
blue
eyes
burning
upon
him
from
her
white
face
cousin
rupert
i
do
not
want
your
company
then
she
added
in
a
whisper
yet
with
a
passion
for
which
rupert
would
never
have
given
her
credit
and
which
took
him
vastly
by
surprise
i
shall
never
forgive
you
my
god
madeleine
cried
he
with
genuine
emotion
have
i
deserved
this
i
have
had
no
thought
but
to
befriend
you
i
have
opened
your
eyes
to
your
own
danger
hold
your
tongue
sir
she
broke
in
with
the
same
repressed
anger
cease
vilifying
the
man
i
love
all
your
aspersions
your
wordy
accusations
will
not
shake
my
faith
in
him
mon
dieu
she
cried
with
an
unsteady
attempt
at
laughter
looking
under
her
lashes
and
tilting
her
little
white
round
chin
at
mr
hobson
who
now
seated
upon
a
large
stone
and
with
an
obtrusive
quid
of
tobacco
bulging
in
an
imperfectly
shorn
cheek
was
mopping
his
forehead
with
a
doubtful
handkerchief
that
is
the
person
i
suppose
whose
testimony
i
am
to
believe
against
my
jack
your
jack
was
prompt
enough
in
running
away
from
him
such
as
he
is
retorted
her
cousin
bitterly
he
could
not
have
struck
for
his
purpose
upon
a
weaker
joint
in
her
poor
womans
armour
of
pride
and
trust
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
as
if
indeed
she
had
received
a
blow
well
say
your
say
she
exclaimed
coming
to
a
standstill
and
facing
him
i
will
hear
all
that
you
and
youryour
friend
have
to
say
lest
with
a
magnificent
toss
of
her
head
you
fancy
i
am
afraid
or
that
i
believe
one
word
of
it
all
i
know
that
jackthat
captain
smith
as
he
is
calledis
engaged
upon
a
secret
and
important
mission
but
it
is
one
rupert
which
all
english
gentlemen
should
wish
to
help
not
impede
do
you
know
what
the
mission
isdo
you
know
to
whom
and
if
my
fair
cousin
it
is
such
that
all
english
gentlemen
would
help
why
then
this
secrecy
she
bit
her
lip
but
it
trembled
what
is
it
you
accuse
him
of
she
asked
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
listen
to
me
said
rupert
gently
it
is
the
kinder
thing
that
you
should
know
the
truth
and
believe
me
every
word
i
say
i
can
substantiate
this
captain
jack
smith
whatever
his
real
name
may
be
was
picked
up
when
a
mere
boy
by
an
old
liverpool
merchant
starving
in
the
streets
of
that
town
this
merchant
by
name
cochrane
an
absurd
person
who
gave
himself
out
to
be
a
relative
of
cochrane
of
shaws
adopted
the
boy
and
started
him
upon
a
slaver
that
is
a
ship
which
does
trade
in
negro
slaves
my
deara
pretty
trade
he
next
entered
a
privateers
ship
as
lieutenant
you
know
what
these
areocean
freebooters
tolerated
by
government
for
the
sake
of
the
harm
they
wreck
upon
the
ships
of
whatever
nation
we
may
happen
to
be
at
war
witha
sort
of
pirate
shiphardly
a
much
more
reputable
business
than
the
slavers
but
captain
smith
made
himself
a
name
in
it
now
that
the
war
is
over
he
has
taken
to
a
lower
traffic
stillthat
of
smuggling
but
what
is
smuggling
cried
the
girl
tears
brimming
up
at
last
into
her
pretty
eyes
and
all
her
heat
of
valiance
suddenly
gone
what
does
it
mean
what
is
smuggling
bless
your
innocence
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dearmiss
i
should
saybut
if
youll
allow
me
i
think
im
the
man
to
explain
that
ere
to
you
the
husky
mellifluous
tones
of
the
preventiveservice
man
who
had
crept
up
unnoticed
to
listen
to
the
conversation
here
murmured
insinuatingly
in
her
ear
rupert
hesitated
then
reading
shrinking
aversion
upon
madeleines
face
shrewdly
conjectured
that
the
exposition
of
her
lovers
doings
might
come
with
more
force
from
mr
hobsons
lips
than
from
his
own
and
allowed
the
latter
to
proceed
unmolested
smuggling
my
pretty
wheezed
the
genial
representative
of
the
custom
laws
again
asking
pardon
but
it
slipped
out
smuggling
is
so
to
say
a
kind
of
stealing
a
kind
of
cheating
and
that
of
a

and
winked
knowingly
at
the

turned
white
as

remained
gazing
at
him
with
a
sort
of
horrified

noted
with
an

rupert
cried
madeleine
piteously
turning
a
dark
gaze
of
anguish
at
himit
seemed
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
he
hastened
up
to
her
shouldering
the
clumsy
form
of
mr
augustus
hobson
unceremoniously
out
of
the
way
the
fellow
had
done
his
work
for
the
time
being
and
this
last
piece
of
it
so
efficaciously
indeed
that
his
present
employer
felt
if
not
remorse
at
least
a
certain
pity
stir
within
him
at
the
stricken
hopelessness
of
the
girls
aspect
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
she
shivered
and
swayed
lean
on
me
he
said
his
fine
eyes
troubled
with
an
unwonted
softness
and
anxiety
rupert
she
whispered
clutching
at
his
sleeve
eagerly
fixing
him
with
a
look
eloquent
of
unconscious
pleading
all
these
things

are
brought
into
englandare
they
not
i
know
thathe
was
bringing
nothing
into
the
country
but
he
was
going
to
another
country
upon
some
important
trust
the
nature
of
which
he
had
promised
not
to
reveal
therefore
he
cannot
be
cheating
the
king
if
that
is
smugglingoh
rupert
is
there
not
some
grievous
mistake
my
poor
child
said
rupert
holding
her
close
and
tenderly
and
speaking
with
a
gentle
gravity
in
which
there
was
this
time
less
hypocrisy
there
is
one
thing
which
is
smuggled
out
of
england
and
it
is
as
dishonest
and
illegal
work
as
the
other
the
most
daring
and
dangerous
smuggling
of
all
in
fact
one
in
which
none
but
a
desperate
man
would
engagethat
of

yes
gold
exclaimed
the
girl
sharply
withdrawing
herself
from
her
cousins
arms
while
a
ray
of
intelligence
and
hope
lit
up
her
face

rupert
betrayed
no
emotion
he
drew
from
the
inner
pocket

his
coat
a
crushed
newssheet
deceived
there
as
well
as
everywhere
else
poor
little
cousin
he
said
and
did
the
scoundrel
say
so
nay
he
is
a
damnable
scoundrel
who
could
betray
your
trustfulness

your
own
sweet
face

not
for

for
the

for
the

who
was
supplied
already
no
doubt
by
the
same
or
similar
traitor
hands
with
enough
to
enable
him
to
escape
from
the
island
where
he
was
so
justly
imprisoned
see
here
madeleine
bonaparte
is
actually
landed
in
france
it
has
all
been
managed
with
the
most
devilish
ingenuity
and
takes
the
whole
world
by
surprise
and
your
lover
doubtless
is
engaged
upon
bringing
him
fresh
supplies
to
enable
him
to
begin
again
and
rack
humanity
with
hideous
wars
oh
he
never
told
you
of
the
corsicans
escape
yet
this
news
is
three
days
old
see
you
my
dear
this
explains
the
whole
mystery
the
necessity
for
absolute
secrecy
all
england
is
friendly
to
the
french
monarch
no
need
to
smuggle
gold
for
his
aidbut
the
other
it
is
treason
the
blackest
treason
on
every
side
of
it
treason
to
his
king
to
his
country
to
your
king
to
you
and
he
would
have
cozened
you
with
tales
of
his
loyalty
to
the
rightful
cause
give
me
the
paper
said
madeleine
a
tide
of
blood
had
swept
into
her
face
she
was
no
longer
white
and
shaken
but
erect
and
beautiful
in
strong
indignation
rupert
examined
her
as
if
a
little
doubtful
how
to
take
the
sudden
change
but
he
handed
her
the
printed
sheet
in
silence
she
read
with
lips
and
nostrils
expanded
by
her
quick
breathing
then
crumpled
up
the
sheet
and
cast
it
at
his
feet
and
after
a
pause
with
her
princess
air
of
dignity
i
thank
you
cousin
rupert
she
said
then
passing
him
with
stately
steps
moved
towards
the
house
he
pressed
forward
to
keep
up
with
her
and
upon
the
other
side
smiling
irrepressible
jocose
mr
hobson
did
the
same
you
are
not
fit
to
go
alone
urged
the
former
while
the
latter
engagingly
protruding
an
elbow
announced
that
hed
be
proud
to
give
her
an
arm
as
far
as
the
hall
she
drew
away
from
this
wellmeaning
squire
of
dames
with
such
shuddering
distaste
and
looked
once
more
so
white
and
worn
and
sickened
after
her
sudden
blaze
of
passion
that
mr
landale
seeing
that
the
only
kindness
was
to
let
her
have
her
will
arrested
his
companion
roughly
enough
and
allowed
her
to
proceed
as
she
wished





and
so
with
bent
head
madeleine
hurried
forth
and
the
same
glorious
sun
smiled
down
upon
her
in
her
anguish
that
had
greeted
her
when
she
hastened
an
hour
before
glowing
and
lightheartedif
indeed
a
heart
so
full
of
love
could
be
termed
lightto
meet
her
lover
the
same
brambles
caught
her
dress
the
same
bird
trilled
his
song
but
madeleine
thought
neither
of
ray
nor
leaf
nor
yet
of
mating
songsters
all
the
spring
world
as
she
went
was
to
her
strewn
with
the
wreck
of
her
broken
hopes
and
encompassed
by
the
darkness
of
her
lonely
future





mr
landale
and
the
preventive
service
man
stood
some
time
watching
her
retreating
figure
through
the
wood
and
then
walked
slowly
on
for
a
while
in
silent
company
presently
the
latter
who
during
the
last
part
of
the
interview
had
begun
to
feel
a
little
ruffled
by
the
magistrates
persistently
overbearing
manner
inquired
with
something
of
dudgeon
in
his
voice
begging
your
pardon
sir
what
was
that
i
heard
the
young
lady
call
out
just
now
gold
she
cries
is
it
guineas
that
nipping
young
man
is
a
taking
over
seas
if
i
may
make
so
bold
now
you
see
sir
we
havent
had
no
orders
about
no
gold
on
this
stationthat
sort
of
thing
is
mostly
done
down
south
but
what
i
wants
to
know
is
why
if
you
knew
all
about
the
fellows
little
games
you
sent
us
to
spy
on
him
ah
poor
nat
would
want
a
word
or
two
with
you
on
that
score
i
fancy
now
its
as
plain
as
salisbury
but
i
know
nothing
certain
impatiently
interrupted
mr
landale
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
yourself
only
not
being
a
perfect
idiot
i
can
put
two
and
two
together
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
can
a
man
smuggle
out
of
england
but
gold
but
i
wanted
the
proofs
and
your
business
it
was
agreed
with
the
chief
officer
was
to
follow
my
instructions
and
so
we
did
grumbled
mr
hobson
and
a
pretty
business
its
turned
out
nats
to
pocket
his
bludgeoning
i
suppose
and
i
am
to
bear
the
blame
and
lose
my
share
a
cargo
of
guineas
by
god
i
might
have
nosed
it
down
south
but
here
blast
it
but
since
you
was
so
clever
over
it
sir
why
in
blazesif
i
may
speak
so
to
a
gentleman
and
a
magistrate
pursued
the
man
with
a
rueful
explosion
of
disgust
didnt
you
give
me
the
hint
why
guineas
is
contraband
of
warits
treason
sirand
guineas
is
a
cargo
thats
fought
for
sir
i
shouldnt
have
moved
with
two
men
in
a
boat
patrol
dye
think
i
should
have
had
the
riding
officers
and
the
waterguard
and
a
revenue
cruiser
in
the
offing
and
all
tight
and
regular
but
you
would
have
all
the
credit
and
where
are
you
and
wheres
my
share
and
where
is
natbah
you
are
forgetting
yourself
officer
said
mr
landale
looking
severely
into
the
eyes
of
the
disappointed
preventive
man
whose
rising
ebullition
became
on
the
instant
reduced
so
i
am
sir
so
i
amand
beg
your
pardon
but
you
must
admit
its
almost
enough
to
make

but
never
mind
sir
the
trick
is
done
whatever
it
may
be
that
that
there
schooner
carries
in
her
bottom
she
is
free
now
to
take
it
barring
accident
wherever
she
pleases
ill
trouble
you
to
look
this
way
sir
they
had
emerged
from
the
wooded
part
of
the
park
and
the
rising
ground
on
which
they
stood
commanded
a
wide
seaview
west
of
the
great
bay
there
she
is
again
sir
said
mr
hobson
waving
his
broad
paw
like
a
showman
displaying
his
goods
with
a
sort
of
enraged
selfsatisfaction
there
is
the
schooner
ready
to
hoist
sail
as
soon
as
he
comes
alongside
and
that
there
black
point
which
you
may
see
if
your
eyes
are
good
enough
is
a
sixoared
galley
with
as
shipshaped
a
crewif
its
the
same
as
i
saw
making
off
this
morningas
ever
pulled
your
captain
smith
you
may
take
your
oath
is
at
the
tiller
and
making
fun
of
us
two
to
the
lads
in
five
minutes
he
will
be
on
board
and
then
the
revenue
cutter
from
the
station
may
give
chase
if
she
likes
and
there
she
is
due
to
the
timeabout
a
mile
astern
but
bless
you
thats
all
my
eye
you
may
take
your

they
know
well
enough
that
in
an
open
sea
they
cant
run
down
a
salcombe
schooner
but
to
earn
their
pay
they
will
hang
on
till
they
lose
her
and
then
sail
home

added
slily
with
a
side
glance
at
the
magistrate
we
wont
hang
him
this
time
mr
landale
made
no
answer
during
the
last
few
minutes
his
reflections
had
enabled
him
to
take
a
new
view
of
the
situation
after
all
the
future
fate
of
captain
jack
was
of
little
moment
he
had
been
successfully
exposed
before
madeleine
whose
love
for
the
young
man
was
as
had
just
been
sufficiently
proved
chiefly
composed
of
those
youthful
illusions
which
dispelled
once
never
can
return
rupert
fell
gradually
into
a
reverie
in
which
he
found
curious
satisfaction
his
work
had
not
been
unsuccessful
whatever
mr
hobsons
opinion
might
be
but
as
matters
stood
between
madeleine
and
her
lover
the
girls
eyes
had
been
opened
in
time
and
that
without
scandal
and
even
the
escape
of
captain
jack
was
upon
reflection
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
and
so
it
was
with
a
return
to
his
usual
polite
bearing
that
he
listened
to
the
officers
relapse
into
expostulation
now
if
you
had
only
given
me
the
hint
first
of
all
the
man
was
grumblingly
saying
and
then
let
me
actfor
who
would
have
suspected
a
boat
yachtrigged
like
thata
friend
of
sir
adrians
too
if
youd
only
left
it
to
me
why
that
sixoared
galley
alone
is
agin
the
law
unless
you
can
prove
good
reason
for
it

as
for
the
vessel
herself
yes
my
dear
mr
hobson
interrupted
mr
landale
smiling
propitiously
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
have
secured
him
i
have
made
a
mess
of
it
but
now
you
understand

said
soonest

both
for
me
and
between
ourselves
mr
hobson
for
the
young
lady
the
man
in
surprise
at
this
sudden
alteration
of
manner
stopped
short
and
gaped
and
presently
a
broad
smile
combined
with
a
knowing
wink
appeared
on
his
face
he
received
the
guineas
that
mr
landale
dropped
in
his
palm
with
an
air
of
great
candour
and
without
further
parley
acted
on
the
kind
advice
to
repair
to
the
priory
and
talk
with
one
mrs
puckett
the
housekeeper
on
the
subject
of
corporeal
refreshment





well
said
molly
bursting
in
upon
her
sister
who
sat
by
her
writingtable
pen
in
hand
and
did
not
even
raise
her
head
at
the
unceremonious
entrance
this
is
evidently
the
day
for
mysterious
disappearances
first
rupert
and
sophia
then
my
lord
and
master
who
is
fetched
hurriedly
to
his
island
that
isle
of
misfortune
god
knows
for
whatthough
i
mean
to
know
presently
then
you
mademoiselle
and
rupert
again
it
is
faith
quite
a
comedy
but
the
result
has
been
that
i
have
had
my
meals
alone
which
is
not
so
gay
sophia
is
in
bed
it
turns
out
rupert
out
ariding
on
important
business
of
course
all
he
does
is
desperately
important
and
there
you
arealone
in
your
room
moping
god
child
how
pale
you
are
what
ails
you
then
molly
cried
madeleine
ignoring
lady
landales
question
and
feverishly
folding
the
written
sheet
which
lay
under
her
hand
if
you
love
me
if
ever
you
loved
me
will
you
have
this
letter
conveyed
by
a
safe
messenger
to
scarthey
and
given
to

none
but
ren
at

oh

will
be
a
service

landale
coolly

about

if
ever

droll
sort
of
plea
in
truth
considering
how
you
have
requited
my
love
madeleine
turned
a
dazed
look
upon
her
sister
who
stood
surveying
her
glowing
like
a
jewel
of
dazzling
radiance
from
her
setting
of
black
mantle
and
black
plumed
hat
so
you
will
not
she
answered
hopelessly
and
let
her
forehead
fall
upon
her
hand
without
further
protest
but
i
did
not
say
i
would
notas

there

soon

dusk
but
there
is
terrible
danger
in
his
being
there
at
all
molly
took
the
letter
turned
it
over
with
scornful
fingers
and
then
popped
it
in
her
pocket
if
he
expects
you
she
asked
fixing
cold
curious
eyes
on
her
sisters
distress
and
he
is
in
danger
why
dont
you
go
a
flush
rose
painfully
to
madeleines
face
a
sob
to
her
throat
dont
ask
me
she
murmured
turning
away
to
hide
her
humiliation
i
have
been
deceived
he
is
not
what
i
thought
lady
landale
gazed
at
the
shrinking
figure
for
a
little
while
in
silence
then
remarking
contemptuously
well
you
are
a
poor
creature
turned
upon
her
heel
to
leave
her
as
she
passed
the
little
altar
she
paused
to
whisk
a
bunch
of
violets
out
of
a
vase
and
dry
the
stems
upon
her
sisters
quilt
molly
cried
madeleine
in
a
frenzy
give
me
back
my
letter
or
go
i
go
i
go
said
lady
landale
with
a
mocking
laugh
how
sweet
your
violets
smellthere
do
not
agitate
yourself
im
going
to
meet
your
lover
my
dear
i
vow
i
am
curious
to
see
the
famous
man
at
last
chapter
xxiv
the
night
so
the
blood
burned
within
her
and
thus
it
cried
to
her
and
there
beside
the
maize
field
the
other
one
was
waiting
he
the
mysterious
one
luteplayers
song
the
mantle
of
night
had
already
fallen
upon
the
land
when
lady
landale
closely
wrapped
in
her
warmest
furs
with
face
well
ensconced
under
her
close
bonnet
and
arms
buried
to
the
elbow
in
her
muff
sallied
from
her
room
on
the
announcement
that
the
carriage
was
waiting
as
with
her
leisurely
daintiness
she
tripped
it
down
the
stairs
she
crossed
mr
landale
and
paused
a
moment
ready
for
the
skirmish
as
she
noticed
the
cynical
curiosity
with
which
he
examined
her
whither
my
fair
sister
said
he
ranging
himself
with
his
best
courtesy
against
the
bannisters
so
late
in
the
day
to
my
lord
and
masters
side
of
course
said
molly
whyis
not
adrian
coming
back
tonight
apparently
not
since
he
has
graciously
permitted
me
to
join
him
upon
his
rock
i
trust
you
will
not
find
it
too
unhappy
in
our
absence
that
would
be
the
crowning
misfortune
of
a
day
when
everything
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
sophia
invisible
with
her
vapours
madeleine
with
the
megrim
and
you
in
and
out
of
the
house
as
excited
and
secret
as
the
cat
when
she
has
licked
all
the
cream
i
suppose
i
shall
end
by
knowing
what
it
is
all
about
meanwhile
i
think
i
shall
enjoy
the
tranquillity
of
the
islandalthough
i
have
actually
to
tear
myself
away
from
the
prospect
of
a
ttette
evening
with
you
but
as
ruperts
serenity
was
not
to
be
moved
her
ladyship
hereupon
allowed
herself
to
be
escorted
to
the
carriage
without
further
parley
as
she
drove
away
through
the
dark
night
first
down
the
level
wellmetalled
avenue
then
along
the
uneven
country
road
and
finally
through
the
sand
of
the
beach
in
which
hoofs
and
tyres
sank
noiselessly
inches
deep
molly
gave
herself
up
with
almost
childish
zest
to
the
leaven
of
imagination
here
in
this
dark
carriage
was
reclining
not
lady
landale
whose
fate
deed
had
already
been
signed
sealed
and
delivered
to
bring
her
nothing
but
disappointment
but
her
happier
sister
still
confronted
with
the
fascinating
unknown
hurrying
under
cover
of
night
within
sound
of
the
sea
to
that
enthralling
lure
a
lovera
real
lover
ardent
daring
young
ready
to
risk
all
waiting
to
spread
the
wings
of
his
boat
and
carry
her
to
the
undiscovered
country
glowing
were
these
fleeting
images
of
the
might
have
been
angry
the
sudden
relapses
into
the
prose
of
reality
no
madeleine
the
coward
who
thought
she
had
loved
her
lover
was
now
in
her
room
weak
and
weeping
whilst
he
no
doubt
paced
the
deck
in
mad
impatience
as
a
lover
should
now
tortured
by
the
throes
of
anxiety
now
hugging
himself
with
the
thought
of
his
coming
bliss

that
bliss
that
never
was
to
be
his
and
in
the
carriage
there
was
only
molly
the
stronghearted
but
the
fettered
by
tie
and
vow
the
slave
for
ever
of
a
first
girlish
fancy
but
too
successfully
compassed
only
lady
landale
rejoining
her
husband
in
his
melancholy
solitude
lady
landale
who
nevernever
awful
word
would
know
the
joys
which
yonder
poor
fool
had
had
within
her
grasp
and
yet
had
not
clutched
at
molly
had
read
as
permitted
her
sisters
letter
and
to
some
purpose
and
scorn
of
the
girl
who
from
some
paltry
quibble
could
abandon
in
danger
the
man
she
professed
to
love
filled
her
soul
to
the
exclusion
of
any
sisterly
or
ever
womanly
pity
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
carriage
was
stopped
by
the
black
shadow
of
a
man
who
seemed
to
spring
up
from
the
earth
and
who
after
a
few
rapid
words
interchanged
with
the
coachman
extinguished
both
the
lights
and
then
opened
the
door
leaning
on
the
offered
elbow
molly
jumped
down
upon
the
yielding
sand
ren
she
asked
for
the
darkness
even
on
the
open
beach

too
thick
to

of
recognition

answered
the
man
in
his
unmistakable
accent
i

ask

the
voice
no
one
can

the

and
as
he
paused
she
added
my
sister
would
not
come
ah
mon
dieu
she
would
not
come
repeated
the
man
in
tones
of
dismay
and
the
black
shadow
was
struck
into
a
moment
of
stillness
then
with
an
audible
sigh
mr
potter
roused
himself
and
saying
with
melancholy
resignation
the
boat
is
there
i
shall
be
of
return
in
a
minute
my
lady
took
the
travellers
bag
on
his
shoulder
and
disappeared
the
carriage
began
to
crunch
its
way
back
in
the
darkness
and
molly
was
left
alone





in
front
of
her
was
a
faint
white
line
where
the
rollers
spread
their
foam
with
mournful
restless
fugue
of
long
drawn
roar
and
hissing
sigh
in
the
distance
now
and
then
glancing
on
the
crest
of
the
dancing
billows
shone
the
steady
light
of
scarthey
the
rising
wind
whistled
in
the
prickly
stargrass
and
seaholly
beyond
these
not
a
sight
not
a
soundthe
earth
was
all
mystery
molly
looked
at
the
lightmarking
the
calm
spot
where
her
husband
waited
for
her
its
very
calm
its
familiar
placidity
monotony
enraged
her
she
hearkened
to
the
splashing
living
waves
to
the
swift
flying
gusts
of
the
storm
wind
and
her
soul
yearned
to
their
life
and
their
mysteriousness
what
she
longed
for
she
herself
could
not
tell
no
words
can
encompass
the
desire
of
pentup
young
vitality
for
the
unknown
for
the
ideal
for
the
impossible
but
one
thing
was
overpoweringly
real
that
was
the
dread
of
leaving
just
then
the
wide
the
open
world
whose
darkness
was
filled
to
her
with
living
scenes
of
freedom
and
space
and
bloodstirring
emotions
of
reentering
the
silent
room
under
the
light
of
consorting
with
the
shadowy
personality
her
husband
of
feeling
the
web
of
his
melancholy
his
dreaminess
imprison
as
it
were
the
wings
of
her
imagination
and
the
thoughtful
kindness
of
his
gaze
paralyse
the
course
of
her
hot
blood
through
her
veins
and
yet
thither
she
was
going
must
be
going
ah
madeleine
foolyou
may
well
weep
yonder
on
your
pillow
for
the
happiness
that
was
yours
and
that
you
have
dropped
from
your
feeble
hands





in
a
few
minutes
the
black
shadow
reappeared
close
to
her
if
my
lady
will
lean
on
my
shoulder
i
shall
lead
her
to
the
boat
and
after
a
few
steps
the
voice
out
of
the
darkness
proceeded
in
explanation
i
have
not
taken
a
lantern
i
have
put
out
those
of
the
carriage
for
i
must
tell
my
lady
that
since
what
arrived
this
morning
there
may
be
gabelousthey
call
them
the
preventive
herein
every
corner
and
the
light
might
bring
them
as
it
does
the
night
papilions
and

as
i
thought
mademoiselle
was
to
accompany
youthey
might
have
frightened
her
these
people
want
to
know
so
much
i
know
nothing
of
what
has
happened
this
morning
that
you
speak
of
as
if
the
whole
world
must
know
retorted
lady
landale
coolly
you
are
all
hatching
plots
and
sitting
on
secrets
but
nobody
confides
in
me
it
seems
then
that
you
expected
mademoiselle
my
sister
here
for
some
purpose
and
that
you
regret
she
did
not
come
may
i
ask
for
an
explanation
a
few
moments
elapsed
before
the
man
replied
and
then
it
was
with
embarrassment
and
diffidence
for
sure
i
am
sorry
my
lady

there
have
been
misfortunes
on
the
island
this
morningnothing
though
to
concern
her
ladyshipand
as
for
mademoiselle
mother
margery
would
have
liked
to
see
her
no
doubt

and
maggie
the
wife
alsoandand
no
doubt
also
mademoiselle
would
have
liked
to
come
what
do
i
know
oh
of
course
said
molly
with
her
little
note
of
mocking
laughter
then
again
they
walked
a
while
in
silence
as
ren
lifted
his
mistress
in
his
arms
to
carry
her
over
the
licking
hissing
foam
she
resumed
it
is
well
ren
you
are
discreet
but
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
people
seem
to
think
as
for
her
you
were
right
in
thinking
that
she
might
easily
be
frightened
she
was
afraid
even
to
come
out
ren
shoved
his
boat
off
and
falling
to
his
sculls
suddenly
relapsed
into
the
old
vernacular
ah
madame
he
sighed
cest
bien
tristeun
gentilhomme
si
beausi
brave
during
the
crossing
no
further
words
passed
between
them
so
braveso
handsome
the
echo
of
the
words
came
back
to
the
woman
in
every
lap
of
the
water
on
the
sides
of
the
boat
in
every
strain
of
the
oars
the
keel
ground
against
the
beach
and
ren
leaped
out
to
drag
the
boat
free
of
the
surf
as
he
did
so
two
blacker
outlines
segregated
themselves
from
the
darkness
and
a
rough
voice
called
out
subdued
but
distinct
savenaye
st
malo
savenaye
st
malo
repeated
ren
and
helped
lady
landale
to
alight
then
one
of
the
figures
darted
forward
and
whispered
a
rapid
sentence
in
the
frenchmans
ear
ren
uttered
an
exclamation
but
his
mistress
intervened
with
scant
patience
my
good
ren
said
she
take
the
bag
into
the
peel
and
come
back
for
me
i
have
a
message
for
these
gentlemen
ren
hesitated
as
he
did
so
a
rustle
of
anger
shook
the
lady
in
her
silks
and
furs
do
you
hear
me
she
repeated
and
he
could
guess
how
her
little
foot
stamped
the
yielding
sand
oui
madame
said
he
hesitating
no
longer
immediately
the
other
two
drew
near
molly
could
just
see
that
they
stood
in
all
deference
cap
in
hand
madam
began
one
of
these
in
hurried
words
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
captain
had
to
remain
on
board
what
interrupted
lady
landale
with
much
asperity
not
come
in
person
she
had
been
straining
her
eyes
to
make
out
something
of
her
interlocutors
form
unable
to
reconcile
her
minds
picture
with
the
coarse
voice
that
addressed
herand
now
all
her
high
expectations
fell
from
her
in
an
angry
rush
have
i
come
all
this
way
to
be
met
by
a
messenger
who
are

entreated
the
husky
voice
i
am
the
mate
of
the
peregrine

captain
has
directed
me
to
beg
and
pray

afraid
but

good
courage
and
confidence

in
five
minutes

can
be
safe
on
board
you
see
madam
continued
the
man
with
an
earnestness
that
spoke
well
of
his
devotion
the
captain
found
he
couldnt
he
dared
not
leave
the
shiphe
is
the
only
one
who
knows
the
bearings
of
these
waters
hereany
one
of
us
might
run
her
on
the
bank
and
where
would

and

partsfor

he
implore
the
lady
not
to
be
afraid
and
tell
her
to
trust
as
she
has
promised

he
says
and
for

minutes

be
with

the
word
madam

i
to
make
the
signal
there
he
is
eating
his
heart
out
there
are
all
the
lads
ready
waiting
for
your
foot
on
the
ladder
to
hoist
sail
no
time
to
lose
we
are
already
behind
shall
i
signal
mollys
heart
beat
violently
under
the
sudden
impulse
the
fascination
of
the
black
chasm
of
the
peril
the
adventure
the
unfathomed
took
possession
of
her
and
whirled
her
on
yes
she
said
on
the
very
utterance
of
the
word
the
man
who
had
not
yet
spoken
uncovered
a
lantern
held
it
aloft
as
rapidly
replaced
it
under
his
coat
and
moved
away
almost
immediately
against
the
black
pall
behind
the
dim
line
of
grey
that
marked
the
shore
suddenly
sprang
up
three
bright
points
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
it
was
as
if
all
the
darkness
around
had
been
filled
with
life
as
if
the
first
fulfilment
of
those
promises
with
which
it
had
been
drawing
this
womans
soul
was
now
held
out
to
her
to
lure
her
further
still
see
madam
how
they
watchby
your
leave
and
with
no
further
warning
molly
felt
herself
seized
with
uncompromising
but
deferential
energy
by
a
pair
of
powerful
arms
lifted
like
a
child
and
carried
away
at
a
bearlike
trot
by
the
splashing
she
judged
it
was
through
the
first
line
of
breakers
then
she
was
handed
into
another
irresistible
grasp
the
boat
lurched
as
the
mate
jumped
in
then
now
give
way
lads
he
said
and
let
her
have
it
those
lights
must
not
be
burning
longer
than
we
can
help
taint
wholesome
for
any
of
us
and
under
the
pulse
of
four
willing
pairs
of
arms
the
skiff
like
a
thing
of
life
clove
the
black
waters
and
rose
to
the
billows
you
see
madam
explained
the
mate
we
could
not
do
without
the
lights
to
show
us
where
she
lay
and
give
us
a
straight
course
we
are
all
right
so
long
as
we
keep
that
top
un
in
the
middlebut
he
wont
be
sorry
i
reckon
when
he
can
drop
them
overboard
they
cant
be
seen
from
the
offing
yet
but
its
astounding
how
far
a
light
will
reach
on
a
night
like
this
cheerily
lads
let
her
have
it
but
molly
heeded
him
not
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
the
thrilling
delight
of
the
excitement
the
die
was
castnot
by
her
own
hand
no
one
should
be
able
to
hold
her
responsibleshe
had
been
kidnapped
come
what
might
she
must
now
see
the
adventure
out
the
lights
grew
larger
presently
a
black
mass
surmounted
by
a
kind
of
greyish
cloud
loomed
through
the
pitch
of
the
night
and
next
it
was
evident
that
the
beacon
was
hanging
over
the
side
of
a
ship
illuminating
its
jagged
leaping
water
line
a
voice
not
too
loud
yet
even
through
the
distance
ringing
clear
in
its
earnestness
sounded
from
above
boat
ahoy
what
boat
is
that
and
promptly
the
helmsman
by
mollys
side
returned
savenaye
st
malo
on
the
instant
the
lights
went
out
there
was
a
creaking
of
block
and
cordage
and
new
ghostly
clouds
rose
over
the
shipsails
loosened
to
the
wind
as
the
skiff
rowers
came
alongside
boathooks
leaped
into
action
and
gripped
the
vessel
an
arm
strong
as
steel
was
held
out
for
the
passenger
as
she
fearlessly
put
her
foot
on
the
ladder
another
a
moment
later
with
masterful
tenderness
bent
round
her
waist
and
she
was
fairly
lifted
on
board
the
peregrine
but
before
her
foot
touched
the
deck
she
felt
upon
her
lips
laid
like
a
burning
seal
a
passionate
kiss
and
her
soul
leaped
up
to
it
as
if
called
into
sudden
life
from
slumber
like
the
princess
of
fairy
lore
she
heard
madeleines
mysterious
lover
whisper
in
her
ear
at
last
oh
what
i
have
suffered
thinking
you
would
not
come
from
the
warm
shelter
of
her
loosened
cloak
the
violets
in
her
bosom
sent
forth
a
wave
of
sweetness
for
a
moment
these
two
were
in
all
creation
alone
to
each
other
while
in
a
circle
the
peregrines
crew
stood
apart
in
respectful
silence
a
broad
grin
of
sympathy
upon
the
mouth
of
every
mothers
son
released
at
last
lady
landale
took
a
trembling
step
on
the
deck
into
what
strange
world
had
she
come
this
night
the
schooner
like
a
mettled
steed
whose
head
is
suddenly
set
free
was
already
in
motion
and
with
gentle
forward
swaying
leaps
rising
to
the
wave
and
gathering
speed
under
her
swelling
sails
captain
jack
had
seized
mollys
hand
and
the
strong
clasp
trembled
round
the
little
fingers
he
said
no
more
to
her
but
in
tones
vibrating
with
emotion
which
all
the
men
now
silently
seeking
their
posts
in
the
darkness
could
hear
my
lads
he
cried
the
lady
is
safe
with
us
after
all
who
shall
say
that
your
skipper
is
not
still
lucky
smith
thank
you
my
good
fellows
now
we
have
yet
to
bring
her
safe
the
other
side
meanwhileno
cheering
lads
you
know
whythere
is
a
hundred
guineas
more
among
you
the
hour
we
make
st
malo
stand
to
every
man
up
with
those
topsails
scarcely
had
the
last
words
been
spoken
when
from
the
offing
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
came
a
longdrawn
hail
faint
through
the
distance
but
yet
fatally
distinct
ahoy
what
schooner
is
that
molly
who
had
not
withdrawn
her
hand
felt
a
shock
pass
over
captain
jacks
frame
he
turned
abruptly
and
she
could
see
him
lean
and
strain
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
the
call
after
an
interval
was
repeated
but
the
outlook
was
impenetrable
and
it
was
weird
indeed
to
feel
that
they
were
seen
yet
could
not
see
molly
standing
close
by
his
side
knew
in
every
fibre
of
her
own
body
that
this
man
to
whom
she
seemed
in
some
inexplicable
fashion
already
linked
was
strongly
moved
nevertheless
she
could
hardly
guess
the
extremity
of
the
passion
that
shook
him
it
was
the
frenzy
of
the
rider
who
feels
his
horse
about
to
fail
him
within
a
span
of
the
winning
post
of
the
leader
whose
men
waver
at
the
actual
point
of
victory
but
the
weakness
of
dismay
was
only
momentary
calm
and
clearness
of
mind
returned
with
the
sense
of
emergency
he
raised
his
nightglass
with
a
steady
hand
this
time
and
scanned
the
depth
of
blackness
in
front
of
him
out
of
it
after
a
moment
there
seemed
to
shape
itself
the
dim
outline
of
a
sail
and
he
knew
that
he
had
waited
too
long
and
had
fallen
in
again
with
the
preventive
cutter
then
glancing
aloft
he
understood
how
it
was
that
the
peregrine
had
been
recognised
the
overcast
sky
had
partly
cleared
to
windward
during
the
last
minutes
a
few
stars
glinted
where
hitherto
nothing
but
the
most
impenetrable
pall
had
hung
in
the
east
the
rays
of
a
yet
invisible
moon
edging
with
faint
silver
the
banks
of
clouds
just
above
the
horizon
had
made
for
the
schooner
a
telltale
background
indeed
on
board
no
sound
was
heard
now
save
the
struggle
of
rope
and
canvas
the
creaking
of
timber
and
the
swift
plashing
rush
of
water
against
her
rounded
sides
as
she
sped
her
course
madeleine
he
said
forcibly
controlling
his
voice
and
bringing
as
he
spoke
his
face
close
to
mollys
to
peer
anxiously
at
its
indistinct
white
oval
we
are
not
free
yet
but
in
a
short
time
with
gods
help
we
shall
have
left
those
intermeddling
fools
yonder
who
would
bar
our
way
miles
out
of
the
running
but
i
cannot
remain
with
you
a
moment
longer
i
must
take
the
helm
myself
oh
forgive
me
for
having
brought
you
to
this
and
should
you
hear
firing
for
heavens
sake
do
not
lose
courage
see
now
i
will
bring
you
to
your
cabin
there
you
will
find
warmth
and
shelter
and
in
a
little
while
a
very
little
while
i
will
return
to
you
to
tell
you
all
is
well
come
my
dearest
love
gently
he
would
have
drawn
her
towards
the
little
deckcabin
guiding
her
steps
as
yet
untutored
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
when
out
of
the
black
chasm
upon
the
weather
bow
of
the
peregrine
leaped
forth
a
yellow
tongue
of
light
fringed
with
red
and
encircled
by
a
ruddy
cloud
and
three
seconds
later
the
boom
of
a
gun
broke
with
a
dull
ominous
clangour
above
the
wrangling
of
sea
and
wind
molly
straightened
herself
what
is
that
she
asked
the
warning
gun
he
answered
hurriedly
to
say
that
they
mean
to
see
who
we
are
and
that
if
we
do
not
stop
the
next
will
be
shotted
time
presses
madeleine
go
infear
nothing
we
shall
soon
be
on
their
other
side
out
of
sight
in
darkness
again
i
shall
stop
with
you
let
no
thought
of
me
hinder
you
i
am
not
afraid
i
want
to
see
at
these
words
the
lover
was
struck
with
a
surprise
that
melted
into
a
proud
and
new
joy
he
had
loved
madeleine
for
her
womans
grace
and
her
womans
heart
now
he
told
himself
he
must
worship
her
also
for
her
brave
soul
but
this
was
no
time
for
useless
words
it
was
not
more
unsafe
for
her
on
deck
than
in
the
cabin
and
at
the
thought
of
her
beside
him
during
the
coming
struggle
the
strength
of
a
god
rose
within
him
come
he
answered
briefly
and
moved
with
her
to
the
helm
which
a
sailor
silently
surrendered
to
him
whilst
she
steadied
herself
by
holding
to
the
binnaclethe
only
place
on
board
at
that
time
where
from
sheer
necessity
any
light
had
been
allowed
to
remain
it
was
faint
enough
but
the
reflection
from
the
compassboard
as
he
bent
to
examine
it
was
sufficient
to
make
just
visible
with
a
dim
fantastic
glow
the
strong
beauty
of
his
face
and
put
a
flash
into
each
wide
dilated
eye
and
thus
did
molly
for
the
first
time
see
captain
jack
she
sank
down
at
the
foot
of
the
binnacle
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
as
if
hugging
the
new
rapture
as
closely
to
her
as
she
could
and
looking
up
at
the
alert
figure
before
her
which
she
now
began
to
discern
more
clearly
under
the
lightening
sky
at
the
face
which
she
divined
although
she
could
only
see
the
watchful
gleam
of
the
eyes
as
now
and
again
they
sought
her
down
in
the
shadow
at
his
feet
she
felt
herself
kindle
in
answer
to
the
glow
of
his
glorious
lifeenergy
they
were
going
side
by
side
this
young
hero
of
romance
and
she
to
fight
their
way
through
some
unknown
peril
madeleine
my
sweet
bride
my
brave
love
they
are
about
to
fire
again
and
this
time
you
will
hear
the
shot
burring
but
be
not
afraid
it
will
strike
ahead
of
us
another
flash
sprang
out
of
the
night
much
nearer
this
time
and
louder
for
it
belched
forth
a
shot
which
ploughed
its
way
in
the
water
across
the
schooners
bow
i
am
not
afraid
said
molly
again
and
she
laughed
a
little
fierce
nervous
laugh
they
are
between
us
and
the
open
sea
thus
far
the
luck
is
on
their
side
had
you
come
but
half
an
hour
sooner
madeleine
we
should
be
running
as
free
as
any
kings
ship
now
they
think
no
doubt
they
will
drive
me
on
to
the
sand
but
he
tossed
back
his
head
with
a
superb
gesture
there
is
no
power
from
heaven
or
hell
that
can
keep
me
out
of
my
course
tonight
by
this
time
the
preventive
cutter
was
faintly
discernible
two
cables
length
on
the
larboard
bow
there
came
another
haila
loud
husky
bellow
from
over
the
water
schooner
ahoy
heave
to
or
well
sink
you
madeleine
said
captain
jack
come
closer
to
me
lie
down
behind
me
quickthe
next
shot
will
be
in
my
rigging
heave
towith
my
treasures
my
bride
on
board
and
a
ten
knot
breeze
and
he
looked
down
at
molly
laughing
in
his
contempt
then
he
shouted
some
order
which
brought
the
peregrine
some
points
more
off
the
wind
and
she
bounded
forward
with
renewed
zest
sink
us
why
dont
you
fire
now
you
lubbers
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
to
see
the
beacon
of
scarthey
straight
over
the
stern
you
have
got
us
in
line
with
the
light
and
thats
your
last
chance
in
another
minute
i
shall
be
past
you
ah
i
can
see
you
now
my
fine
fellowscourage
madeleine
to
molly
of
course
his
words
conveyed
no
meaning
except
that
the
critical
moment
had
come
that
the
ship
which
carried
her
flying
upon
the
water
like
a
living
thing
eager
yet
obedient
in
all
its
motions
to
the
guiding
will
of
the
man
beside
her
was
rushing
to
the
fray
the
thought
fired
her
soul
and
she
sprang
up
to
look
over
the
side
what
she
exclaimed
for
the
little
cutter
on
close
quarters
looked
insignificant
indeed
by
the
side
of
the
noble
vessel
that
so
scornfully
bore
down
on
her
is
that
all
they
have
a
gun
and
we
have
none
answered
captain
jack
down
madeleine
down
behind
in
the
name
of
god
why
should
i
crouch
if
you
stand
up
the
mans
heart
swelled
within
him
but
as
he
looked
with
proud
admiration
at
the
cloaked
and
hooded
figure
by
his
side
the
cutters
gun
fired
for
the
third
time
with
roar
and
hiss
the
shot
came
over
the
bow
of
the
schooner
as
she
dipped
into
the
trough
and
raking
the
deck
crashed
through
her
side
on
the
quarter
molly
gave
a
shriek
and
staggered
a
fearful
malediction
burst
from
captain
jacks
lips
he
left
the
tiller
and
sprang
to
her
one
of
the
hands
believing
his
skipper
to
have
been
struck
ran
to
the
helm
and
again
put
the
vessel
on
her
proper
course
which
a
few
moments
later
was
to
make
her
shoot
past
the
revenue
cutter
wounded
madeleine
wounded
through
my
fault
by
the
living
god
they
shall
pay
for
this
oh
groaned
molly
something
has
cut
me
in
the
arm
and
shoulder
then
rapidly
gathering
composure
but
its
not
much
i
can
move
it
at
one
glance
the
sailor
saw
from
the
position
of
the
shot
hole
in
the
vessels
side
that
the
wound
could
only
have
been
made
by
a
splinter
but
the
possibility
of
exposing
his
beloved
to
such
another
risk
was
not
to
be
bornea
murderous
rush
of
blood
flew
to
his
brain
the
cutter
perceiving
the
tactics
of
the
swifter
schooner
was
now
tacking
about
with
the
intention
of
bringing
the
gun
to
bear
upon
her
once
more
as
she
attempted
to
slip
by
but
captain
jack
in
his
newfanned
fury
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
desperate
cast
of
the
die
starboard
hard
a
starboard
he
called
out
in
a
voice
that
his
men
had
known
well
in
old
fighting
days
and
which
was
heard
as
far
as
the
cutter
itself
they
shall
not
fire
that
gun
again
with
a
brief
starboard
it
is
sir
the
man
who
had
taken
the
helm
brought
the
ship
round
and
the
silent
active
crew
in
a
trice
were
ready
to
go
about
majestically
the
schooner
changed
her
course
and
as
the
meaning
of
the
manoeuvre
became
fearfully
apparent
shouts
and
oaths
arose
in
confusion
from
the
cutter
what
are
you
going
to
do
eagerly
asked
molly
enthralled
by
the
superb
motion
of
the
vessel
under
her
foot
as
it
swept
round
and
increased
speed
upon
the
new
tack
he
held
her
in
his
arms
his
hand
had
sought
her
wounded
shoulder
and
pressed
the
lacerated
spot
in
his
effort
to
staunch
the
precious
blood
that
rose
warm
through
the
cloth
torturing
his
cold
fingers
i
am
going
to
clear
those
men
from
our
way
to
freedom
and
to
love
i
am
going
to
sink
that
boat
they
shall
pay
with
their
lives
for
this
come
to
the
other
side
madeleine
and
watch
how
my
stout
peregrine
sweeps
our
courseand
then
i
may
see
how
these
scoundrels
have
mangled
you
my
love
but
nay
this
is
no
sight
for
you
hold
on
close
to
me
sweet
and
hide
your
eyes
while
they
go
he
steadied
himself
firmly
with
one
hand
on
the
rigging
now
musket
shots
flashed
on
board
the
cutter
in
quick
succession
and
sundry
balls
whizzed
over
the
poop
intended
for
the
helmsman
by
their
side
captain
jack
gnashed
his
teeth
as
the
menacing
drone
of
one
of
them
came
perilously
close
to
the
beloved
head
by
his
cheek
look
out
every
man
well
run
her
down
he
called
his
voice
was
like
the
blast
of
bugles
cheers
broke
out
from
every
part
of
the
ship
drowning
the
yells
of
execration
and
the
shouts
of
fear
from
below
and
now
with
irresistible
sway
the
rushing
peregrine
heavy
and
powerful
was
closing
and
bearing
down
upon
her
frailer
enemy
there
was
a
spell
of
suspense
when
all
was
silence
save
the
rush
and
turmoil
of
the
waters
and
the
flapping
of
the
cutters
sails
helpless
for
the
moment
in
the
teeth
of
the
breeze
like
a
charging
steed
the
schooner
seemed
to
leap
at
her
foe
then
came
the
shock
there
was
a
brief
check
in
her
career
she
rose
by
the
head
the
rigging
strained
and
sighed
the
masts
swayed
groaning
but
stood
over
the
bows
in
the
darkness
was
heard
a
longdrawn
crash
was
seen
a
white
wall
of
foaming
water
rising
silently
to
break
the
next
moment
with
a
great
roar
the
cutter
struck
obliquely
amidships
was
thrown
straightway
on
her
beam
ends
the
peregrine
with
every
sail
spread
and
swollen
held
her
as
the
preying
bird
with
outstretched
wings
holds
its
quarry
and
pressed
her
down
until
she
began
to
fill
and
settle
it
was
with
wideopen
eyes
with
eager
throbbing
heart
that
molly
watched
it
all
lights
my
lads
cried
captain
jack
with
a
shout
of
exultation
when
the
anxious
instant
had
passed
take
in
every
man
you
can
save
but
handspike
is
the
word
for
the
first
who
shows
fight
curwen
do
you
get
her
clear
again
all
around
upon
the
deck
sprang
rumour
and
turmoil
came
shouts
and
sounds
of
scuffling
and
the
rushing
of
feet
from
the
blank
waters
came
piteous
calls
for
help
but
paying
little
heed
to
aught
but
molly
captain
jack
seized
a
lighted
lantern
from
the
hands
of
a
passing
sailor
and
drew
her
aside
fevered
with
pain
and

to

her

over
her

allowed
herself
to

into

little
deck

placed
the

upon
the
table

here
he
said
quickly
once
more
striving
to
see
her
beneath
the
jealous
shade
i
must
find
out
if
anything
is
amiss
on

the

to

i
shall
be
back

the
light
shone
full
on
his
features
which
molly
eagerly
scanned
from
her
safe
recess
when
she
met
his
eyes
full
of
the
triumph
of
love
and
hope
her
soul
broke
into
fierce
revoltagain
she
felt
upon
her
lips
that
kiss
of
young
passionate
love
that
had
been
the
first
her
life
had
ever
known

might
be
the
last

disclosure

approaching
apace
she
was
glad
of
the
respite

said
with
as
much
firmness
as
she
could
muster

he
had

his

his
fury
as
he
dashed

with

to

the
thought
illumined
his
brain
with
glory
as
he
rushed
back
to
the
silent
muffled
figure
that
still
stood
awaiting
his
coming
at

panting
in
the
excess
of
his
joy

can
hardly

but
selfish
brute
that
i
am
you
must
be
crushed
with
fatigue
my
brave

you
would
make
me
forget
your
tender
womans
frame
and
you
are
wounded
supporting
herfor
the
ship
reaching
the
open
sea
had
begun
to
roll
more
wildlyhe
led
her
back
into
the
little
room
now
lighted
by
the
fitful
rays
of
a
swinging
lamp
with
head
averted
she
suffered
herself
to
be
seated
on
a
kind
of
sofa
couch
when
he
had
closed
the
door
he
seized
her
hand
on
which
ran
streaks
of
halfdried
blood
and
covered
it
with
kisses
ah
madeleine
here
in
the
sanctuary
i
had
prepared
for
you
where
i
thought
you
would
be
so
safe
so
guarded
tell
me
that
you
forgive
me
for
having
brought
this
injury

you

fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
madeleine
my
wife
you
must
let
me
tend
you
then
as
she
shivered
slightly
but
did
not
turn
to
him
he
went
on
in
tones
of
the
most
restrained
tenderness
mingled
with
humblest
pleading
had
it
not
been
for
your
accident
i
had
not
ventured
even
to
cross
the
threshold
of
this
room
but
your
wound
must
be
dressed
darling
darling
allow
me
forgive
me
the
risk
is
too
great
rising
to
his
feet
again
he
gently
pulled
at
her
cloak
molly
spoke
not
a
word
but
untied
it
at
the
neck
and
let
it
fall
away
from
her
fair
young
body
and
keeping
her
hooded
face
still
rigidly
averted
she
surrendered
her
wounded
arm
he
muttered
words
of
distress
at
the
sight
of
the
broad
blood
stains
stepped
hurriedly
to
a
little
cupboard
where
such
surgical
stores
as
might
be
required
on
board
were
hoarded
and
having
selected
scissors
lint
and
bandages
came
back
and
again
knelt
down
by
her
side
to
cut
off
with
eager
compassionate
hands
the
torn
and
maculated
sleeve
the
wound
was
but
a
surface
laceration
and
a
man
would
not
have
given
a
thought
to
it
in
the
circumstances
but
to
see
this
soft
white
womans
skin
bruised
black
in
parts
torn
with
a
horrid
red
gap
in
others
to
see
the
beauty
of
this
round
arm
thus
brutally
marred
thus
twitching
with
painit
was
monstrous
hideously
unnatural
in
the
lovers
eyes
with
tenderness
but
unflinchingly
he
laved
the
mangled
skin
with
cool
fresh
water
pulled
out
with
far
greater
torture
to
himself
than
to
her
some
remaining
splinters
embedded
in
the
flesh
covered
the
wound
with
lint
and
finished
the
operation
by
a
bandage
as
neat
as
his
neat
sailors
touch
coupled
with
some
knowledge
of
surgery
gained
in
the
experiences
of
his
privateering
days
could
accomplish
it
he
spoke
little
only
a
word
of
encouragement
of
admiration
for
her
fortitude
now
and
then
and
she
spoke
not
at
all
during
the
ministration
she
had
raised
her
other
hand
to
her
eyes
with
a
gesture
natural
to
one
bracing
herself
to
endurance
and
had
kept
it
there
until
his
task
completed
her
silence
the
manner
in
which
she
hid
her
face
from
him
awoke
in
him
all
that
was
best
and
loftiest
in
his
generous
heart
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
before
her
he
too
dared
not
speak
for
fear
of
bruising
what
he
deemed
an
exquisite
maidenliness
before
which
his
manhood
was
abashed
at
itself
for
some
moments
there
was
no
sound
in
the
cabin
save
that
of
the
swift
rushing
waters
behind
the
wooden
walls
and
of
the
labour
and
life
of
the
ship
under
full
sail
then
he
saw
the
tumultuous
rising
of
her
bosom
and
thought
she
was
weeping
madeleine
he
cried
with
passionate
anxiety
speak
let
me
see
your
faceare
you
faint
lie
upon
this
couch
let
me
get
you
wineoh
that
these
days
were
passed
and
i
could
call
you
wife
and
never
leave
you
madeleine
my
love
speak
molly
rose
to
her
feet
and
with
a
gesture
of
anger
threw
off
her
hood
and
turned
round
upon
him
and
there
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
he
glared
like
one
distraught
at
the
raven
locks
the
burning
eyes
of
a
strange
woman
she
was
very
pale
no
said
molly
defiantly
when
twice
or
thrice
his
laboured
breath
had
marked
the
passing
of
the
horrible
moment
i
am
not
madeleine
then
she
tried
to
smile
but
unconsciously
she
was
frightened
and
the
smile
died
unformed
as
she
pursued
at
random
you
know
meperhaps
by
hearsayas
i
know
you
captain
smith
but
he
shivering
under
the
coldness
of
his
disappointment
answered
in
a
kind
of
weary
whisper
who
are
youyou
who
speak
with
her
voice
who
stand
at
her
height
and
move
and
walk
as
she
does
i
have
seen
you
surelyah
i
know
madam
what
a
cruel
mockery
and
she
where
is
she
still
staring
at
her
with
widely
dilated
eyes
he
seized
his
forehead
between
his
hands
the
gesture
was
one
of
utter
despair
before
this
weakness
molly
promptly
resumed
the
superiority
of
selfpossession
yes
she
said
and
this
time
the
smile
came
back
to
her
face
i
am
lady
landale
and
my
sister
madeleinei
grieve
to
have
to
say
sohas
not
had
that
courage
for
which
you
gave
her
credit
tonight
little
was
required
at
a
moment
like
this
to
transmute
such
thoughts
as
seethed
in
the
mans
head
to
a
burst
of
fury
fury
is
action
and
action
a
relief
to
the
strained
heart
there
was
a
halfconcealed
unintended
mockery
in
her
tones
which
brought
a
sudden
fire
of
anger
to
his
eyes
he
raised
both
hands
and
shook
them
fiercely
above
his
head
but
whywhy
in
the
name
of
heavenhas
such
a
trick
been
played
on
me

at
such
a
time
he
paused
and
trembling
with
the
effort
restrained
himself
to
a
more
decent
bearing
before
the
woman
the
lady
the
friends
wife
his
arms
fell
by
his
side
and
he
repeated
in
lower
tones
though
the
flame
of
his
gaze
could
not
be
subdued
why
this
deception
this
playing
with
the
blindness
of
my
love
why
this
comedy
which
has
already
had
one
act
so
tragicyes
think
of
it
madam
think
of
the
tragedy
this
is
now
in
my
life
since
she
is
left
behind
and
i
never
now
with
these
mens
lives
to
account
for
may
go
back
and
claim
her
who
has
given
me
her
troth
already
i
staked
the
fortune
of
my
trust
on
the
bare
chance
that
she
would
come
what
though
her
heart
failed
her
at
the
eleventh
hourgod
forgive
her
for
itsurely
she
never
sanctioned
this
masquerade
oh
no
she
would
not
stoop
to
such
an
act
and
human
life
is
not
a
thing
to
jest
upon
she
never
played
this
trick
the
thought
is
too
odious

hopeless
outlaw
the
actual
murderer
that
this
nights
work
has
made
of
me
his
voice
by
degrees
rose
once
more
to
the
utmost
ring
of
bitterness
and
anger
molly
who
had
restored
her
cloak
to
her
shoulders
and
sat
down
ensconced
in
it
as
closely
as
her
swaddled
arm
would
allow
her
contemplated
him
with
a
curious
mixture
of
delight
and
terror
delight
in
his
vigour
his
beauty
above
everything
in
his
mastery
and
strength
and
delight
again
at
the
new
thrill
of
the
fear
it
imposed
upon
her
daring
soul
then
she
flared
into
rage
at
the
thought
of
the
coward
of
her
blood
who
had
broken
faith
with
such
a
man
as
this
and
she
melted
all
into
sympathy
with
his
angera
right
proper
man
most
cruelly
used
and
most
justifiably
wrathful
and
she
being
a
woman
whose
face
was
at
most
times
as
a
book
on
which
to
read
the
working
of
her
soul
there
was
something
in
her
look
as
in
silence
she
listened
and
gazed
upon
him
which
struck
him
suddenly
dumb
such
a
look
on
a
face
so
like
yet
so
unlike
that
of
his
love
was
startling
in
the
extremehorrible
he
stepped
back
and
made
as
if
he
would
have
rushed
from
the
room
then
bethinking
himself
that
he
was
a
madman
he
drew
a
chair
near
her
in
a
contrary
mood
sat
down
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
very
steadily
she
dropped
her
long
lids
and
demurely
composed
her
features
by
some
instinct
that
women
have
rather
than
from
any
sense
of
the
impression
she
had
produced
a
little
while
they
sat
thus
again
in
silence
in
the
silence
the
rolling
of
the
ship
and
the
manner
in
which
as
she
raced
on
her
way
she
seemed
to
breathe
and
strain
worked
in
with
the
mood
of
each
in
his
with
the
storm
and
stress
of
his
soul
in
hers
as
the
very
expression
of
her
new
freedom
and
reckless
pleasure
then
he
spoke
the
strong
emotion
that
had
warmed
her
had
now
left
his
voice
it
was
cold
and
scornful
madam
i
await
your
explanation
so
far
i
find
myself
only
the
victim
of
a
trick
as
unworthy
and
cruel
as
it
is
purposeless
she
had
delayed
carrying
out
her
mission
with
the
most
definite
perverseness
she
could
not
but
acknowledge
the
justice
of
his
reproof
realise
the
sorry
part
she
must
play
in
his
eyes
the
inexcusable
folly
of
the
whole
proceeding
and
yet
she
was
strung
to
a
very
lively
indignation
by
the
tone
he
had
assumed
and
suddenly
saw
herself
in
the
light
of
a
most
disinterested
and
injured
virtue
captain
smith
she
exclaimed
flashing
a
hot
glance
at
him
you
assume
strangely
the
right
to
be
angry
with
me
be
angry
if
you
will
with
things
as
they
are
rail
against
fate
if
you
will
but
be
grateful
to
mei
have
risked
much
to
serve
you
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
changed
abruptly
to
one
of
eager
almost
entreating
inquiry
do
me
the
favour
she
continued
to
look
into
the
pocket
of
my
cloakmy
arm
hurts
me
if
i
moveyou
will
find
there
a
letter
addressed
to
you
i
was
adjured
to
see
that
it
should
reach
you
in
safety
i
promised
to
place
it
in
your
own
hands
this
could
hardly
have
been
done
sooner
as
you
know
the
words
all
at
once
seemed
to
alter
the
whole
situation
he
sprang
up
and
came
to
her
quickly
oh
forgive
me
make
allowances
for
me
lady
landale
i
am
quite
distracted
there
had
returned
a
tinge
of
hope
into
his
voice
where
is
it
he
eagerly
asked
seeking
as
directed
for
the
pocket
ah
and
mechanically
repeating
forgive
me
he
drew
out
the
letter
at
last
and
retreated
feverishly
opening
it
under
the
light
of
the
lamp
molly
had
turned
round
to
watch
up
to
this
she
had
felt
no
regret
for
his
disillusion
only
an
irritable
heat
of
temper
that
he
should
waste
so
much
love
upon
so
poor
an
object
but
now
all
her
heart
went
to
him
as
she
saw
the
sudden
greyness
that
fell
on
his
face
from
the
reading
of
the
very
first
line
there
was
no
indignation
no
bloodstirring
emotion
it
was
as
if
a
cold
pall
had
fallen
upon
his
generous
spirit
the
very
room
looked
darker
when
the
fire
within
the
brave
soul
was
thus
all
of
a
sudden
extinguished
he
read
on
slowly
with
a
kind
of
dull
obstinacy
and
when
he
came
to
the
miserable
end
continued
looking
at
the
paper
for
the
moment
then
his
hand
fell
slowly
the
letter
fluttered
to
the
floor
and
he
let
his
eyes
rest
unseeingly
wonderingly
upon
the
messenger
after
a
little
while
words
broke
from
him
toneless
the
mere
echo
of
dazed
thoughts
it
is
over
all
over
she
has
lost
her
trust
she
does
not
love
me
any
more
he
picked
up
the
letter
again
and
sitting
down
placed
it
in
front
of
him
on
the
table
tis
a
cruel
letter
madam
that
you
have
brought
me
he
said
then
looking
up
at
molly
with
the
most
extraordinary
pain
in
his
eyes
a
cruel
letter
yet
i
am
the
same
man
now
that
i
was
this
morning
when
she
swore
she
would
trust
me
to
the
endand
she
could
not
trust
me
a
few
hours
longer
why
did
you
not
speak
one
word
from
you
as
you
stepped
upon
the
ship
would
have
saved
my
soul
from
the
guilt
of
these
mens
death
then
with
a
sharper
uplifting
of
his
voice
as
a
new
aspect
of
his
misfortune
struck
him
and
youyou
too
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
adrians
wife
he
does
not
know
she
did
not
reply
and
he
cried
out
clapping
his
hands
together
it
only
wanted
this
my
god
it
is
ii
his
friend
who
owes
him
so
much
who
am
to
cause
him
such
fear
such
misery
do
you
know
madam
that
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
restore
you
to
him
for
days
yet
and
then
when
and
where
and
how
god
knows
nothing
must
now
come
between
me
and
my
trust
i
have
already
dishonourably
endangered
it
to
attempt
to
return
with
you
tonight
as
perhaps
you
fancy
i
willas
of
course
i
would
instantly
do
had
i
alone
myself
and
you
to
consider
would
be
little
short
of
madness
it
would
mean
utter
ruin
to
many
whom
i
have
pledged
myself
to
serve
and
yet
adrianmy
honour
pulls
me

wayspoor

what
dumb
devil
possessed
you
that
you
did
not

he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
lady
landale
flushed
and
paled
alternately
parted
her
lips
to
speak
and
closed
them
once
more
what
could
she
say
and
how
excuse
herself
she
did
not
repent
what
she
had
done
though
it
had
been
sin
all
round
she
had
little
reck
of
her
womans
good
name
as
he
called
it
the
death
of
the
excise
men
weighed
but
lightly
if
at
all
upon
her
conscience
the
thought
of
adrian
was
only
then
a
distasteful
memory
to
be
thrust
away
nayeven
this
mans
grief
could
not
temper
the
wild
joy
that
was
in
her
soul
tonight
fevered
with
fatigue
with
excitement
by
her
wound
her
blood
ran
burning
in
her
veins
and
beat
faster
in
every
pulse
and
as
she
felt
the
ship
rise
and
fall
and
knew
that
each
motion
was
an
onward
leap
that
separated
her
further
and
ever
further
from
dull
home
and
dull
husband
and
isolated
her
ever
more
completely
with
her
sisters
lover
she
exulted
in
her
heart
presently
he
lifted
his
head
forgive
me
he
said
i
believe
that
you
meant
most
kindly
and
as
you
say
i
should
be
grateful
your
service
is
illrequited
by
my
reproaches
and
you
have
run
risk
indeedmerciful
heaven
had
my
old
friends
wife
been
killed
upon
my
ship
through
my
doings
but
you
see
i
cannot
command
myself
you
see
how
i
am
situated
you
must
forgive
me
all
that
can
be
done
to
restore
you
to
your
home
as
soon
as
possible
shall
be
done
and
all
meanwhile
to
mitigate
the
discomfort
you
must
suffer
hereand
for
your
good
intention
to
her
and
me
i
thank
you
he
had
risen
and
now
bowed
with
a
dignity
that
sat
on
his
sailor
freedom
in
no
wise
awkwardly
she
too
with
an
effort
stood
up
as
if
to
arrest
his
imminent
departure
a
tall
woman
and
he
but
of
average
height
their
eyes
were
nearly
on
a
level
for
a
second
or
two
her
dark
gaze
sought
his
with
a
strange
hesitation
and
then
as
if
the
truth
in
him
awoke
all
the
truth
in
her
the
natural
daring
of
her
spirit
rose
proudly
to
meet
this
kindred
soul
she
would
let
no
falsehood
no
craven
feminine
subterfuge
intervene
between
them
do
not
thank
me
she
exclaimed
glowing
with
a
brilliant
scorn
in
which
the
greatness
of
her
beauty
all
worn
as
she
was
struck
him
into
surprise
yet
evoked
no
spark
of
admiration
what
i
did
i
did
to
gratify
myself
oh
aye
if
i
were
as
other
women
i
should
smile
and
take
your
compliments
and
pose
as
the
martyr
and
as
the
selfsacrificing
devoted
sister
but
i
will
not
it
was
nothing
to
me
how
madeleine
got
in
or
out
of
her
love
scrapes
i
would
not
have
gone
one
step
to
help
her
break
her
promise
to
you
or
even
to
save
your
life
but
that
it
pleased
me
so
to
do
madeleine
has
never
chosen
to
make
me
her
confidant
i
would
have
let
her
manage
her
own
affairs
gaily
had
i
had
better
things
to
occupy
my
mindbut
i

not
captain
smith
life
at
pulwick
is
monotonous
i
have
roaming
blood
in
my
veins
the
adventure
tempted

me
fascinated
meand
there
you
have
the
truth
of
course
i
could
have
given
the
letter
to
the
men
and
sent
them
back
to
you
with
itit
was
not
because
of
my
promise
that
i
did
not
do
it
of
course
i
could
have
spoken
the
instant
i
got
on
board
perhaps
here
a
flood
of
colour
dyed
her
face
with
a
gorgeous
conscious
crimson
and
a
dimple
faintly
came
and
went
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
perhaps
i
would
have
spoken
but
then
you
must
remember
you
closed
my
lips
my
god
said
captain
jack
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
horror
but
this
she
could
not
see
for
her
eyes
were
downcast
and
now
that
i
have
come
she
went
on
and
would
have
added
i
am
glad
i
did
but
that
all
of
a
sudden
a
new
bashfulness
came
upon
her
and
she
stammered
instead
incoherently
as
for
adrianren
knew
i
had
a
message
for
you
and
ren
will
tell
himhe
is
not
stupidyou
knowren
i
mean
i
am
glad
answered
the
man
gravely
after
a
pause
if
you
have
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
your
husband
knows
you
to
be
on
my
ship
he
will
then
be
the
less
anxious
at
your
disappearance
for
he
knows
too
madam
that
his
wife
will
be
as
honoured
and
as
guarded
in
my
charge
as
she
would
be
in
her
mothers
house
he
bowed
again
in
a
stately
way
and
then
immediately
left
her
molly
sank
back
upon
her
couch
and
she
could
not
have
said
why
burst
into
tears
she
felt
cold
now
and
broken
and
her
stiffening
wound
pained
her
but
nevertheless
as
she
lay
upon
the
little
velvet
pillow
and
wept
her
rare
tears
were
strangling
sobs
the
very
ache
of
her
wound
had
a
strange
savour
that
she
would
not
have
exchanged
for
any
past
content





ren
having
obeyed
his
mistresss
orders
and
left
her
alone
with
the
sailors
on
the
beach
withdrew
within
the
shelter
of
the
door
but
remained
waiting
near
enough
to
be
at
hand
in
case
he
should
be
called
it
was
still
pitch
dark
and
the
rollers
growled
under
a
rough
wind
he
could
catch
the
sound
of
a
mans
voice
now
and
again
between
the
clamour
of
the
sea
and
the
wuthering
of
the
air
but
could
not
distinguish
a
word
presently
however
this
ceased
and
there
came
to
him
the
unmistakable
regular
beat
of
oars
retreating
the
interview
was
over
and
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
thought
that
at
last
his
masters
friend
would
soon
be
setting
on
his
way
to
safety
the
servant
emerged
to
seek
her
ladyship
a
few
minutes
later
he
dashed
into
sir
adrians
room
with
a
livid
face
and
poured
forth
a
confused
tale
milady
had
landed
without
mademoiselle
had
stopped
to
speak
to
two
of
the
peregrine
whilst
he
waited
apart
the
men
had
departed
in
their
boat
the
peregrine
men
but
the
ship
has
been
out
of
sight
these
eight
hours
ejaculated
sir
adrian
bewildered
then
catching
fear
from
his
servants
distraught
countenance
my
wife
he
exclaimed
bounding
up
and
added
you
left
her
renny
the
man
struck
his
breast
he
had
searched
and
called

repeated

to
be

lanterns
said
sir
adrian
the
anguish
of
a
greater
dread
driving
the
blood
to
his
heart
even
to
one
who
knew
the
ground
well
the
isle
of
scarthey
on
a
black
stormy
night
with
the
tide
high
was
no
safe
wandering
ground
for
a
moment
the
twocomrades
of
so
many
miserable
hoursfaced
each
other
with
white
and
haggard
faces
then
with
the
same
deadly
fear
in
their
hearts
they
hurried
out
into
the
soughing
wind
down
to
the
beach
baited
on
all
sides
by
the
swiftdarting
hissing
surf
running
their
lanterns
close
to
the
ground
they
soon
found
by
the
trampled
marks
upon
the
sand
where
the
conclave
had
been
held
from
thence
a
double
row
of
heavy
footprints
led
to
the
shelving
bit
of
beach
where
it
was
the
custom
for
boats
to
land
from
seawards
see
your
honour
see
cried
ren
in
deepest
agitation
the
print
of
this
little
shoe
hereand
there
and
here
again
right
down
to
the
waters
edge
thank

god
my
lady
has
had
no
accident
she
has
gone
with
the
sailors
to
the
boat
ah
here
the
tide
has
comewe
can
see
no
farther
but
why
should
she
have
gone
with
them
came
after
a
moment
sir
adrians
voice
out
of
the
darkness
surely
that
is
strangeand
yet

yes
that
is
indeed
her
footprint
in
the
sand
and
if
your
honour
will
look
to
sea
he
will
perceive
the
ships
lights
yonder
upon
the
water
that
is
the
captains
ship
your
honour
i
must
avow
to
you
that
i
have
concealed
something
from
youit
was
wrong
indeed
and
now
i
am
punishedbut
that
poor
monsieur
the
captain
i
was
so
sorry
for
him
and
he
so
enamoured
he
had
made
a
plan
to
lift
off
mademoiselle
madeleine
with
him
tonight
marry
her
in
france
and
that
was
why
he
came
back
again
at
the
risk
of
his
life
he
supplicated
me
not
to
tell
you
for
fear
you
would
wish
to
prevent
it
or
think
it
your
duty
to
mademoiselle
had
promised
it
seemed
and
he
was
mad
with
her
joy
the
poor
gentleman
and
as
sure
of
her
faith
as
if
she
had
been
a
saint
in
heaven
but
my
lady
came
alone
your
honour
as
i
said
the
courage
had
failed
to
mademoiselle
i
suppose
at
the
last
moment
and
madame
bore
a
message
to
the
captain
but
the
captain
was
not
able
to
leave
his
ship
it
seems
and
my
faith
cried
mr
potter
his
spirits
rising
as
the
first
ghastly
dread
left
him
the
mystery
explains
itself
it
is
quite
simple
your
honour
will
see
as
the
captain
did
not
come
to
the
island
according
to
his
promise
to
mademoisellehe
had
good
reasons
no
doubtmadame
went
herself
to
his
ship
with
her
message
she
had
the
spirit
for
itah
if
mademoiselle
had
had
but
a
little
of
it
tonight
we
should
not
be
where
we
are
sir
adrian
caught
at
the
suggestion
out
of
the
depths
of
his
despair
you
are
right
renny
you
must
be
right
yet
on
this
rough
sea
in
this
black
nightwhat
madness
the
boat
instantly
and
let
us
row
for
those
lights
as
we
never
rowed
before
even
as
the
words
were
uttered
the
treble
glimmer
vanished
in
vain
they
strained
their
eyes
save
for
the
luminous
streak
cast
by
their
own
beacon
lamp
the
gloom
was
unbroken
his
honour
will
see
a
boat
will
be
landing
instantly
with
my
lady
safe
and
sound
said
ren
at
last
but
his
voice
lacked
confidence
and
sir
adrian
groaned
aloud
and
so
they
stood
alone
in
silence
forced
into
inaction
that
most
cruel
addition
to
suspense
by
the
darkness
and
the
waters
which
hemmed
them
in
upon
every
side
the
vision
of
twenty
dangerous
places
where
one
impetuous
footfall
might
have
hurled
his
darling
into
the
cruel
beating
waves

themselvesa

merciless
waters
of
the
earth

had
murdered
the

grasped
at
the
childs
life
also
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
wild
cry
it
seemed
as
if
the
wind
caught
it
from
him
and
tore
it
into
shreds
hark
whispered
ren
and
clasped
his
masters
icy
hand
like
an
echo
of
sir
adrians
cry
the
faroff
ring
of
a
human
voice

risen

the

as

been
rifted
apart
beneath
the
breath
of
the
north

the
horizon

a
misty
winglike
shape

suddenly
visible
against
the
receding
gloom
the
captains

the
peregrine
as
master
and
man
peered
outward
as
if
awaiting
unconsciously
some
imminent
solution
from
the
gliding
spectre
it
seemed
as
if
the
night
suddenly
opened
on
the
left
to
shoot
forth
a
burst
of
red
fire
a
few
seconds
later
the
hollow
boom
of
cannon
shook
the
air
around

adrians

driven
into

by

stormy
nights
of

following
in
its
dwindling

misty

physically

scanned
afresh
the
sand
the

the

the

to
return
once

double
track

heavy

sir
adrian
knelt
down
and
gazed
at
the
last
little
imprint
that
seemed
to
mock
him
with
the
same
elusive
daintiness
as
molly
herself
as
if
he
could
draw
from
it

answer
to
the
riddle

to

down
his
lantern

and
strove
by
thumping
his
breast
vigorously
to
infuse
a
little
warmth
into
his
numbed
limbs
and
at
the
same
time
to
relieve
his
overcharged
feelings
as
he
paused
at
length
out
of
breath
the
noise
of
a
methodical
thud
and
splash
of
oars

above
the
tumult

the

in
the
excess
of
the
sudden
joy

waving
his
lantern
then
he
sent
forth
a
vigorous

up

sir
adrian
unable
to
restrain
his
impatience
ran
forward
too
and
threw
the
light
of
his
lantern
upon
the
dark
figures
now
rising
one
by
one
and
pressing
forward
five

six
men
drenched
from
head

and
grumbling
with
faces
pinched
with
cold
all
lowering
with
the

expression
of
anger
and
resentment
and
shining
whitely
at
him
out
of
the
confusion
he
saw

emptying
seats
the
shipped
oars
the

in
black
letters
upon
the
white
paint

she
she
was
not
there
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
so
cruel
that
for
a
while
he
seemed
turned
to
stone
even
his
mind
becoming
blank
the

lashed
in
up
to
his

never

drag
him
away

then
rens
voice
in

hot
whisper
close
to
his

aroused
him

and
they
were
after
the

but
he
ran
down
their
cutter
that
brave
captain
and
these
are
all
that
were
saved
from
her
for
she
sank
like
a
stone
the
peregrine
is
as
sound
as
a
bell
they
sayah
she
is
a
good
ship
and
the
captain
out
of
his
kind
heart
sent
these
villains
ashore
in
his
own
boat
instead
of
braining
them
or
throwing
them
overboard
but
they
saw
a
lady
beside
him
the
whole
time
tall
in
a
great
black
cloak
my
lady
in
her

even
a

would
have
compromised
his
honour
but
his
honour
can
see
now
how
it
is
and

without
which
all
else
was
as
nothing
fate
and
his
own
hot
blood
had
conspired
to
place
his
hearts
desire
beyond
all
reasonable
hope
certain
phrases
in
madeleines
letter
crossed
and
recrossed
his
mind
bringing
now
an
unwonted
sting
of
anger
now
the
old
cruel
pain
of
last
night
the
thought
of
the
hateful
complication
introduced
into
his
already
sufficiently
involved
affairs
by
the
involuntary
kidnapping
of
his
friends
wife
filled
him
with
a
sense
of
impotent
irritation
very
foreign
to
his
temper
and
as
certain
looks
and
words
of
the
unwishedfor
prisoner
flashed
back
upon
him
a
hot
colour
rose
even
in
his
solitude
to
his
wholesome
brown
cheek
but
in
spite
of
all
in
spite
of
reason
and
feeling
alike
his
essential
buoyancy
asserted
itself
he
could
not
despair
he
had
not
been
given
this
vigour
of
soul
and
body
to
sit
down
under
misfortune
resignation
was
for
the
poor
of
heart
only
cravens
gave
up
while
it
was
yet
possible
to
act
his
fair
ship
was
speeding
with
him
as
he
loved
to
feel
her
speed
around
him
spread
the
vast
spaces
in
which
his
spirit
rejoicedsalt
sea
and
vaulted
heavens
the
full
air
of
the
open
the
brisk
dash
of
the
wind
filled
him
with
physical
exhilaration
at
every
breath
and
tingled
in
his
veins
the
sporting
blood
which
had
come
to
him
from
generations
of
hunting
squires
found
all
its
craving
satisfied
in
this
coursing
across
the
green
ocean
fields
and
the
added
element
of
danger
was
as
the
sting
of
the
brine
to
his
palate
whatdespair
now
with
his
perilous
enterprise

he
was
actually
trolling
out
the
stave
of
a
song
as
he
sprang
up
the
companion
ladder
after
his
rough
breakfast
in
the
galley
but
the
sound
expired
at
the
sight
of
the
distant
flutter
of
a
womans
scarf
in
the
stern
of
the
ship
he
halted
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
crisp
hair
with
an
expressive
gesture
of
almost
comical
perplexity
all
would
be
plain
sailing
enough
with
hope
at

for

to

down

yet
as
such
again
hideously
doubly
unwelcome
to
him
as
he
stood
biting
his
lips
while
the
gorgeous
sunshine
of
the
young
spring
morning
beat
down
upon
his
bare
head
the
brawny
figure
of
the
mate

mahoganytinted
face
wrinkled
into
as
stiff
a
grin
as
if
it
had
been
indeed
carved
out
of
the
wood
in
question
intervened
between
his
abstracted
gaze
and
the
restless
amber
beyond
its
a
fine
day
sir
by
way
of
opening
conversation
the
irrepressible
satisfaction
conveyed
by
the
wide
display
of
tobaccostained
teeth
by
the
twinkle
in
the
hard
honest
eyes
called
up
a
queer
rueful
grimace
to
the
other
mans
face
do
you
know
curwen
he
said
that
you
brought
me
the
wrong
young
lady
last
night
the
sailor
jumped
back
in
amazement
the
wrong
young
lady
sir
staring
with
starting
incredulous
eyeballs
the
wrong
young
lady
here
he
clapped
his
thigh
well
of
allthe
wrong
young
lady
are
you
quite
sure
sir
captain
jack
laughed
aloud
but
it
was
with
a
bitter
twist
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
well
im
said
poor
curwen
all
his
importance
and
selfsatisfaction
had
left
him
as
suddenly
as
the
starch
a
soused
collar
he
scanned
his
masters
face
with
almost
pathetic
anxiety
oh
i
dont
blame
youyou
did
your
part
all
right
why
i
myself
fell
into
the
same
mistake
and
we
had
not
much
time
for
finding
it
out
had
we
the
lady
you
seethe
ladyshe
is
the
other
ladys
sister
and
she
came
with
a
message
and
so
we
carried
her
off
before
we
knew
where
we
wereor
she
either
added
captain
jack
as
a
mendacious
after
thought
well
im
reiterated
curwen
who
then
rubbed
his
scrubby
bristling
chin
scratched
his
poll
and
finally
broke
into
another
grinthis
time
of
the
kind
classified
as
sheepish
and
whatll
be
to
do
now
by
the
god
that
made
me
i
havent
a
notion
we
must
take
all
the
care
of
her
we
can
of
course
serve
her
her
meals
in
her
cabin
as
was
arranged
and
see
that
she
is
attended
to
just
as
the
other
young
lady
would
have
been
you
know
only
that
i
think
she
had
better
be
served
alone
and
i
shall
mess
downstairs
as
usual
and
then
if
we
can
leave
her
at
st
malo
we
shall
but
it
must
be
in
all
safety
curwen
for
its
a
terrible
responsibility
happily
we
have
now
the
time
to
think
meanwhile
i
have
slept
like
a
log
and
shei
see
is
astir
before
me
lord
bless
you
sir
she
has
been
up
these
two
hours
walking
the
deck
like
a
sailor
and
asking
about
things
and
enjoying
them
like
ah
she
is
a
rare
lady
that
she
is
and
it
is
the
wrong
onewell
this
is
a
go
and
i
was
remarking
to
bill
baxter
just
now
that
it
was
just
our
captains
luck
to
have
found
such
a
regular
sailors
young
woman
so
i
saidbegging
pardon
for
the
word
and
not
more
than
he
is
worth
says
he
and
so
said
i
also
and
she
the
wrong
lady
after
all
well
its
a
curious
thing
sir
nobody
could
be
like
to
guess
it
from
her
shes
a
wellplucked
one
with
her
wound
and
all
she
made
me
look
at
it
this
morning
when
i
brought
her
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
bite
youre
old
enough
to
be
my
father
says
she
as
pretty
as
can
be
so
you
shall
be
doctor
as
well
as
ladys
maid
and
if
youve
got
a
girl
of
your
own
itll
be
a
story
to
tell
her
by
the
fire
at
night
when
youre
home
again
so
she
said
and
never
winced
when
i
put
my
great
fingers
on
her
arm
i
was
all
of
a
tremble
i
declare
with
her
a
smiling
up
at
me
but
the
woundits
doing
finely
healing
as
nice
as
ever
i
see
and
not
a
sign
of
sickness
on
her
the
very
lady
as
i
was
saying
for
our
captainbut
here
she
comes
this
was
an
unwontedly
long
speech
for
curwen
and
silent
again
he
effaced
himself
discreetly
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
angry
ejaculation
that
had
sprung
to
his
captains
lips
but
not
without
a
backward
glance
of
admiration
at
the
tall
alert
figure
now
bearing
down
in
their
direction
with
steps
already
firmly
balanced
to
the
movement
of
the
ship
at
a
little
distance
from
captain
jack
molly
paused
as
if
to
scrutinise
the
horizon
and
enjoy
the
invigorating
atmosphere
in
reality
her
heart
was
beating
fast
her
breath
came
short
and
the
gaze
she
flung
from
the
faint
outline
of
coast
upon
one
side
to
the
vast
monotony
of
sparkling
sea
upon
the
other
conveyed
no
impression
to
her
troubled
mind
the
next
instant
he
was
by
her
side
as
she
smiled
at
him
he
noticed
that
her
face
was
pale
and
her
eyes
darkly
encircled
ah
madam
said
he
as
he
drew
close
and
lifted
his
hand
to
his
head
with
a
gesture
of
formal
courtesy
that
no
doubt
somewhat
astonished
a
couple
of
his
men
who
were
watching
the
group
with
covert
smiles
and
nudges
being
as
yet
unaware
of
the
misadventure
you
relieve
my
mind
of
anxiety
how
is
the
arm
does
it
make
you
suffer
much
no
you
must
be
strong
indeed
yes
i
am
strong
answered
she
and
flushed
and
looked
out
across
the
sea
inhaling
the
air
with
dilated
nostrils
within
her
her
soul
was
crying
out
to
him
it
was
as
if
there
was
a
tide
there
as
fierce
and
passionate
as
the
waves
around
her
all
bearing
straining
to
him
and
this
with
a
struggle
and
flow
so
resistless
that
she
could
neither
remember
the
past
nor
measure
the
future
but
only
feel
herself
carried
on
beaten
and
tossed
upon
these
great
waters
like
a
helpless
wreck
i
trust
you
are
well
attended
to
began
the
man
constrainedly
again
i
fear
you
will
have
to
endure
much
discomfort
i
had
reckoned
here
he
halted
galled
by
the
thought
of
what
it
was
he
had
reckoned
upon
the
thought
of
the
watchful
love
that
was
to
have
made
of
the
little
ship
a
very
nest
for
his
bride
of
the
exquisite
joy
it
was
to
have
harboured
and
he
set
his
teeth
at
fate
she
played
for
a
while
with
her
little
finger
tips
upon
the
rail
then
turned
her
gaze
full
and
bold
upon
him
i
do
not
complain
she
said
he
bowed
gravely
we
will
do
our
best
for
you
and
if
you
will
take
patience
the
time
will
pass
at
last
as
all
time
passes
i
have
a
few
books
they
shall
be
brought
into
your
cabin
in
three
days
we
shall
be
in
st
malothere
if
you
like
he
hesitated
embarrassed
there
echoed
lady
landale
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
upon
his
downcast
faceif
i
likewhat
we
could
leave
you
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
quickly
with
stormy
breaths
alone
moneyless
in
a
strange
townthat
is
well
and
kindly
thought
she
said
whence
had
come
to
her
this
strange
power
of
feeling
pain
she
had
not
known
that
one
could
suffer
in
ones
heart
like
this
she
whose
quarrel
with
life
hitherto
had
been
for
its
too
great
comfort
security
and
peace
she
felt
a
lump
rise
to
her
throat
and
tears
well
into
her
eyes
blurring
all
the
sunlit
vision
and
she
turned
her
head
away
and
beat
her
sound
left
hand
clenched
upon
the
ledge
before
heaven
cried
jack
distressed
out
of
his
unnatural
stiffness
you
mistake
me
lady
landale
i
am
only
anxious
to
do
what
is
best
for
you
what
adrian
would
wish
to
leave
you
alone
deserted
helpless
at
st
malo
you
could
not
have
thought
i
should
mean
that
no
indeed
i
would
have
seen
you
into
safe
hands
in
some
comfortable
hotel
with
a
maid
to
wait
upon
youi
know
of
such
a
placeadrian
could
not
have
been
long
in
coming
to
fetch
you
i
should
have
had
a
letter
ready
to
post
to
him
the
instant
we
landed
as
to
money
flushing
boyishly
that
is
the
least
considerationthere
is
no
dearth
of
that
to
fear
if
you
prefer
it
i
can
however
convey
you
somewhere
upon
the
english
coast
after
we
quit
st
malo
but
that
will
entail
a
longer
residence
for
you
here
on
board
ship
and
it
is
no
fit
place
for
you
still
looking
out
across
the
sea
molly
replied
in
a
deep
shaken
voice
unlike
her
own
you
did
not
think
it
unfit
for
my
sister
your
sister
but
your
sister
was
to
have
been
my
wife
burning
through
the
mists
of
her
unshed
tears
once
more
her
glance
returned
to
his
and
i
she
cried
and
here
was
suddenly
silent
again
gazing
at
the
thin
circlet
of
gold
upon
her
left
hand
beneath
the
flashing
diamonds
after
a
moment
then
she
broke
out
fiercelyoh
do
with
me
what
you
will
but
for
gods
sake
leave
me
in
peace
and
stamping
turned
her
shoulder
on
him
to
stare
straight
outwards
as
before
captain
jack
drew
back
paused
an
instant
clutched
his
hair
with
a
desperate
gesture
and
slowly
walked
away





the
voyage
of
the
peregrine
was
as
rapid
as
her
captain
had
hoped
and
the
dawn
of
the
fourth
day
broke
upon
them
from
behind
the
french
coast
where
normandy
joins
old
armorica
for
a
little
while
lady
landale
awakened
from
her
uneasy
sleep
by
the
unusual
stir
on
deck
lay
languidly
watching
the
light
as
it
filtered
through
the
porthole
of
her
little
cabin
the
colours
growing
out
of
greyness
on
the
walls
listening
to
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
mates
husky
voice
without
then
her
heart
tightened
with
a
premonition
of
the
coming
separation
she
sat
up
and
looked
out
of
her
window
as
the
horizon
rose
and
fell
giddily
to
her
eye
there
lay
the
fatal
line
of
land
the
land
of
her
blood
but
to
her
now
the
land
of
exile
she
had
seen
but
little
of
captain
jack
these
last
two
days
interchanged
but
few
and
formal
words
with
him
now
and
then
as
they
met
morning
and
evening
or
came
across
each
other
during
the
day
she
felt
that
he
avoided
her
but
she
had
seen
him
she
had
heard
his
voice
they
had
been
close
to
each
other
upon
the
great
seas
however
divided
and
this
had
been
something
to
feed
upon
now
what
prospect
before
her
hungry
heart
butstarvation
at
least
the
last
precious
moments
should
not
be
lost
to
her
she
rose
and
dressed
in
haste
a
difficult
operation
in
her
maimed
state
before
leaving
her
narrow
quarters
she
peered
into
the
lookingglass
with
an
eagerness
she
had
never
displayed
in
the
days
of
her
vain
girlhood
what
a
fright
she
said
to
the
anxious
face
that
looked
back
at
her
with
yearning
eyes
and
dark
burning
lips
and
she
thought
of
madeleines
placid
fairness
as
cain
might
of
abels
modest
altar
when
she
emerged
upon
deck
a
strange
and
beautiful
scene
was
spread
to
her
gaze
a
golden
haze
enveloped
the
water
and
the
coast
but
out
of
it
in
brown
jagged
outline
against
the
blazing
background
of
glowing
sunlight
rose
the
towers
the
pointed
roofs
and
spires
of
that
old
corsairs
hive
st
malo
the
waters
were
bright
green
frothed
with
oily
foam
around
the
ship
the
masts
cast
strange
long
black
shadows
and
molly
saw
one
spring
from
her
own
feet
as
she
moved
into
the
morning
glow
the
peregrine
she
noticed
was
cruising
parallel
with
the
coast
instead
of
making
for
the
harbour
and
just
now
all
was
very
still
on
board
two
men
conspicuous
against
the
yellow
sky
stood
apart
a
little
forward
with
their
backs
turned
to
her
one
of
these
was
captain
jack
gazing
steadily
at
the
town
through
a
telescope
the
other
the
mate
both
were
silent
silently
herself
and
unnoticed
molly
went
up
and
stood
beside
them
observing
her
sisters
lover
as
intently
as
he
that
unknown
distant
point
she
presently
saw
the
lean
hand
nearest
her
tremble
ever
so
slightly
as
it
held
the
glass
then
he
turned
and
handed
it
to
his
companion
saying
briefly
see
what
you
make
of
it
the
man
lifted
the
glass
set
it
looked
dropped
his
hand
and
faced
his
captain
their
eyes
met
but
neither
spoke
for
a
second
or
two
it
is
so
then
said
the
captain
at
last
aye
sir
no
mistake
about
that
theres
the
tricolour
up
againand
be
damned
to
itas
large
as
life
to
be
sure
the
healthy
tan
of
the
captains
face
had
not
altered
by
one
shade
his
mouth
was
set
in
its
usual
firm
line
but
by
the
intuition
of
her
fiery
soul
the
woman
beside
him
knew
that
he
had
received
a
blow
a
strange
thing
went
on
curwen
in
a
grumbling
guttural
bass
and
its
only
a
year
ago
since
they
set
up
the
old
white
napkin
again
you
did
not
look
for
this
sir
he
too
had
his
intuitions
no
curwen
it
is
the
last
thing
i
looked
for
and
it
spells
failure
to
mefailure
once
more
as
he
spoke
he
turned
his
head
slightly
and
perceiving
molly
standing
close
behind
him
glanced
up
sharply
and
frowned
then
strove
to
smooth
his
brow
into
conventional
serenity
and
greeted
her
civilly
curwen
clenching
his
hard
hands
together
round
the
telescope
retired
a
step
and
stood
apart
still
hanging
on
his
captains
every
gesture
like
a
faithful
dog
what
does
it
mean
asked
molly
disregarding
the
morning
salutation
it
means
strange
things
to
france
responded
captain
jack
slowly
with
a
bitter
smile
and
to
me
madam
it
means
that
i
have
come
on
a
wild
goose
chase
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
glass
once
more
as
he
spokealthough
even
by
the
naked
eye
the
flag
minute
as
it
was
could
be
seen
to
flash
red
in
the
breezeand
sought
the
faroff
flutter
again
and
then
closing
the
instrument
with
an
angry
snap
tossed
it
back
but
what
does
it
mean
reiterated
molly
a
wild
impatience
a
wild
hope
trembling
in
her
breast
it
means
madam
that
i
have
brought
my
pigs
to
the
wrong
market
cried
captain
jack
still
with
the
smile
that
sat
so
strangely
upon
his
frank
lips
that
the
goods
i
have
to
deliver
i
cannot
deliver
for
if
there
is
any
meaning
in
symbols
by
the
wave
of
that
tricolour
yonder
the
country
has
changed
rulers
again
my
dealings
were
to
be
with
the
kings
men
and
as
they
are
not
here
at
least
no
longer
in
powerhow
could
they
be
under
that
ragi
must
even
trot
the
cargo
home
again
not
a
word
to
the
men
curwen
but
give
the
order
to
sheer
off
we
have
lowered
the
blue
white
and
red
too
often
have
not
we
to
risk
a
good
english
ship
unarmed
under
the
nozzles
of
those
republican
or
imperial
guns
the
man
grinned
the
two
could
trust
each
other
molly
turned
away
and
moved
seawards
for
she
knew
that
the
joy
upon
her
face
was
not
to
be
hidden
captain
jack
fell
to
pacing
the
deck
with
bent
head
and
long
slow
steps
absorbed
in
dovetailing
the
last
secret
arrangements
of
his
venture
and
more
intent
still
during
his
very
few
hours
of
idleness
on
the
engrossing
thought
of
love
he
had
had
no
knowledge
of
the
extraordinary
challenge
to
fate
cast
by
bonaparte
of
that
challenge
which
was
to
end
in
the
last
and
decisive
clash
of
french
and
english
hosts
he
had
not
even
heard
of
the
corsicans
return
to
france
with
his
handful
of
grenadiers
for
newspapers
were
scarce
at
scarthey
but
even
had
he
heard
like
the
rest
of
the
world
he
would
no
doubt
have
thought
no
more
of
it
than
as
a
mad
freak
born
of
the
vanquished
usurpers
foolhardy
restlessness
but
the
conclave
of
plenipotentiaries
assembled
at
vienna
were
not
more
thunderstruck
when
on
that
very
19th
of
march
the
semaphore
brought
them
news
of
the
legitimate
king
of
france
once
more
fled
and
of
his
country
once
more
abandoned
to
the
hated
usurper
than
was
captain
jack
as
he
watched
the
distant
flagstaff
in
the
sunrise
and
saw
when
the
morning
port
gun
had
vomited
forth
its
white
cloud
on
the
ramparts
of
st
malo
the
fatal
stripes
run
up
the
slender
line
in
lieu
of
the
white
standard
but
jack
smiths
mind
like
his
body
was
quick
in
action
the
sun
had
travelled
but
a
degree
or
two
over
the
wide
undulating
land
the
mists
were
yet
rising
when
suddenly
he
halted
and
called
the
mate
in
those
commanding
tones
that
had
from
the
first
time
she
had
heard
them
echoed
in
mollys
heart
bring
her
alongside
one
of
those
smacks
yonder
the
furthest
out
to
sea
thereupon
followed
curwens
hoarse
bellow
an
ordered
stampede
upon
the
deck
and
gracefully
with
no
more
seeming
effort
than
a
swan
upon
a
garden
pond
the
peregrine
veered
and
glided
towards
the
rough
skiff
with
its
single
ochre
sail
and
its
couple
of
brownfaced
fishermen
who
had
left
their
nets
to
watch
her
advance
captain
jack
leant
over
the
side
his
hands
over
his
mouth
and
hailed
them
in
his
britishfrenchcorrect
enough
but
stiff
to
his
tongue
as
molly
heard
and
smiled
at
and
loved
him
for
in
womans
way
when
she
loves
at
all
ahoy
the
friend
a
golden
piece
for
him
who
will
come
on
board
and
tell
the
news
of
the
town
a
brief
consultation
between
the
fisher
pair
un
cu
dor
repeated
captain
jack
then
there
was
a
flash
of
white
teeth
on
the
two
weatherbeaten
faces
on
y
va
patron
cried
one
of
the
fellows
cheerfully
and
jumped
into
his
dinghey
while
his
comrade
still
stared
and
grinned
and
the
stalwart
lads
of
the
peregrine
grinned
back
at
the
queer
foreign
figure
with
the
brown
cap
and
the
big
gold
earrings
soon
the
fishermans
bare
feet
were
thudding
on
the
deck
and
he
stood
before
the
english
captain
cap
in
hand
his
little
quick
black
eyes
roaming
in
all
directions
over
the
wonders
of
the
beautiful
white
ship
with
innocent
curiosity
but
before
captain
jack
could
get
his
tongue
round
another
french
phrase
molly
detaching
herself
from
her
post
of
observation
came
forward
smiling
let
me
speak
to
him
she
said
he
will
understand
me
better
and
it
will
go
quicker
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
captain
jack
hesitated
a
moment
saw
the
advantage
of
the
suggestion
and
then
accepted
the
offer
with
the
queer
embarrassment
that
always
came
over
him
in
his
relations
with
her
you
are
very
good
he
said
oh
i
like
to
talk
the
father
and
mother
tongue
she
said
gaily
and
sweetly
her
eyes
danced
he
had
never
seen
her
in
this
mood
and
as
before
grudgingly
had
to
admit
her
beauty
and
if
you
will
allow
it
she
went
on
i
am
glad
to
be
of
use
too
the
fisherman
twirling
his
cap
in
his
knotted
fingers
stared
at
her
open
mouthed
une
si
belle
dame
like
a
queen
and
speaking
his
tongue
that
it
was
a
music
to
listen
to
this
was
in
truth
a
ship
of
marvels
ah
bon

there
were

the
goodmorning
and
monsieur
too
did
they
like
no
little
fresh
soles
this
morning
he
had
some
leaping
then
below
in
his
boat
no
well
the
goodmorning
then
they
had
heard
enough
the
fisherman
paddled
back
to
his
skiff
and
molly
stood
watching
from
a
little
distance
the
motionless
figure
of
the
captain
of
the
peregrine
as
with
one
hand
clenching
the
handrail
he
gazed
towards
st
malo
with
troubled
eyes
after
a
few
minutes
curwen
advanced
and
touched
him
lightly
on
the
arm
captain
jack
turned
slowly
to
look
at
him
his
face
was
a
little
pale
and
his
jaw
set
but
the
mate
who
had
served
under
him
since
the
day
he
first
stepped
upon
the
old
st
nicholas
a
gallant
fairfaced
lad
and
who
knew
every
turn
of
him
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
himself
saw
that
he
had
taken
his
decision
and
he
stepped
back
satisfied
ready
to
shape
his
course
for
the
near
harbour
or
for
the
pacific
ocean
or
back
to
scarthey
itself
at
his
masters
bidding
call
the
men
up
said
the
captain
they
have
earned
their
bounty
and
they
shall
have
it
though
their
skipper
is
a
poorer
man
than
he
thought
to
be
by
this

his
good
lads

not

and
the

does
not
all
the

within

curwen
said
captain
jack
suddenlythe
two
stood
together
at
the
helm
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
and
the
peregrine
was
once
more
alone
a
speck
upon
the
waste
of
waters
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
return
to
scarthey
the
mate
wagged
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
shifted
his
hand
on
the
helm
ay
ay
sir
he
said
after
just
an
instants
pause
i
would
not
run
you
and
the
men
into
unnecessary
danger
that
you
may
be
sure
of
but
the
fact
is
curwen
im
in
a
devil
of
a
fix
all
round
theres
no
use
hiding
it
from
you
and
all
things
considered
to
land
the
lady
and
the
cargo
at
the
lighthouse
itself
gives
me
as
fair
a
chance
of
getting
out
of
it
as
any
plan
i
can
think
of
the
cargos
not
all
my
own
and
its
a
valuable
one
i
daresay
you
have
guessed
as
much
and
its
not
the
kind
we
want
revenue
men
to
pry
into
i
could
not
unload
elsewhere
that
i
know
of
without
creating
suspicion
as
to
storing
it
elsewhere
its
out
of
the
question
scartheys
the
place
though
its
a
damned
risky
one
just
now
but
weve
run
many
a
risk
together
in
our
day
have
we
not
ay
sir
whos
afraid
then
theres
the
lady
lowering
his
voice
shes
lady
landale
my
friends
wife
the
wife
of
the
best
friend
ever
man
had
ay
you
remember
him
i
doubt
notthe
gentleman
seaman
of
the
porcupinei
owe
him
more
than
i
can
ever
repay
and
he
owes
me
something
too
that
sort
of
thing
binds
men
together
and
see
what
i
have
done
to
himcarried
off
his
wife
curwen
grunted
enigmatically
and
disengaged
a
hand
to
scratch
his
chin
i
must
have
speech
with
him
i
must
it
is
enough
to
drive
me
mad
to
think
what
he
may
be
thinking
of
me
what
i
purpose
is
this
well
disguise
the
ship
as
far
as
we
can
we
have
the
time
paint
her
a
new
streak
and
alter
those
topsails
change
the
set
of
the
bowsprit
and
strike
out
her
name
thats
unlucky
said
the
mate
unlucky
is
it
well
shes
not
been
so
lucky
this
run
that
we
need
fear
to
change
the
luck
then
curwen
well
slip
in
at
night
at
a
high
tide
watching
for
our
opportunity
and
a
dark
sky
well
unship
the
cargo
and
then
you
shall
take
command
of
her
and
carry
her
off
to
the
east
coast
and
wait
there
till
i
am
able
to
send
you
word
or
join
you
it
will
only
be
a
few
hours
danger
for
the
men
after
all
still
keeping
his
seaman
eye
upon
the
compass
curwen
cleared
his
throat
with
a
gruesome
noise
then
in
tones
which
seemed
to
issue
with
difficulty
from
some
immense
depth
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
that
aint
a
bargain
how
now
cried
his
captain
sharply
no
sir
rolling
his
head
portentously
that
dont
run
to
a
bargain
that
dont
the
lads
of
the
peregrine
ll
stick
to
their
skipper
through
thick
and
thin
ill
warrant
them
every
man
jack
of
them
and
if
there
was
one
who
grumbled
id
have
my
knife
in
him
before
another
caught
the
temper
from
himi
would
or
my
names
not
curwen
if
ye
bid
us
steer
to
hell
well
do
it
for
you
sir
and
welcome
but
for
to
go
and
leave
you
thereno
sir
it
cant
be
done
captain
jack
gave
a
little
laugh
that
was
as
tender
as
a
womans
tear
curwen
rolled
his
head
again
and
mumbled
to
himself
it
cant
be
done
then
jack
smith
clapped
his
hand
on
the
sailors
shoulder
but
its
got
to
be
done
he
cried
it
is
the
only
thing
you
can
do
to
help
me
curwen
to
have
our
peregrine
out
in
the
daylight
on
that
coast
would
be
stark
madnessno
disguise
could
avail
her
and
you
cant
change
your
ugly
old
phiz
can
you
as
for
me
i
must
have
a
few
days
on
shore
danger
or
no
danger
ah
curwen
with
a
sudden
passionate
outbreak
there
are
times
when
a
mans
life
is
the
least
of
his
thoughts
couldnt
i
stop
with
you
sir
i
would
not
trust
the
ship
to
another
and
you
would
double
the
risk
for
me
i
could
double
a
blow
for
you
too
cried
the
fellow
hoarsely
but
if
its
got
to
beit
must
be
ill
do
it
sir
i
count
on
it
said
the
captain
briefly
as
the
ring
of
his
retreating
steps
died
away
upon
his
ear
the
mate
shook
his
head
in
melancholy
fashion
women
he
said
is
very
well
ive
nought
to
say
against
them
in
their
way
and
the
seas
very
wellas
i
ought
to
know
but
women
and
the
sea
it
dont
agree
theys
jealous
one
of
the
other
and
a
man
gets
torn
between
as
molly
sat
in
her
cabin
watching
the
darkening
sky
outside
with
dreaming
eyes
she
started
on
seeing
captain
jack
approach
and
instead
of
passing
her
with
cold
salute
halt
and
look
in
i
would
speak
a
word
with
you
he
said
on
deck
then
said
molly
she
felt
somehow
as
if
under
the
broad
heaven
they
were
nearer
each
other
than
in
that
narrow
room
the
sea
was
rough
the
wind
had
risen
and
still
blew
from
the
north
it
was
cold
but
her
blood
ran
too
fast
these
days
to
heed
it
she
drew
one
of
the
capes
of
her
cloak
over
her
head
and
staggering
a
little
for
the
schooner
sailing
close
to
the
wind
pitched
and
rolled
to
some
purpose
she
made
for
her
usual
station
at
the
bulwarks
well
she
asked
he
briefly
told
her
his
purpose
of
returning
to
scarthey
direct
her
eye
dilated
she
grew
pale
is
that
not
dangerous
he
made
a
contemptuous
gesture
but
they
must
be
watching
for
you
on
that
coast
you
have
sunk
the
boatkilled
those
men
to
return
theremy
god
what
folly
i
must
land
my
goods
madam
you
forget
that
i
have
more
contraband
on
board
than
smuggler
as
i
am
even
i
bargained
for
if
it
is
for
mei
would
rather
fling
myself
into
the
waves
this
instant
than
that
you
should
expose
yourself
to
danger
then
i
should
fling
myself
after
you
and
that
would
be
more
dangerous
still
he
smiled
a
little
mockingly
upon
her
as
he
spoke
but
the
words
called
a
transient
fire
into
her
face
you
would
risk
your
life
to
save
me
she
cried
to
save
adrians
wife
madam
bah
he
would
have
gone
then
but
she
held
him
with
her
free
hand
she
was
again
white
to
the
lips
but
her
eyeshow
they
burned
he
would
have
given
all
his
worth
to
avoid
what
he
felt
was
coming
a
woman
at
such
a
juncture
may
forbid
speech
or
deny
her
ear
a
man
unless
he
would
seem
the
first
of
josephs
or
the
last
of
coxcombs
dare
not
even
hint
at
his
unwelcome
suspicions
i
will
not
have
you
go
into
this
danger
i
will
not
stammered
molly
incoherently
the
dusk
was
spreading
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
larger
in
the
uncertain
light
lady
landale
you
misunderstand
it
is
true
that
to
see
you
safely
restored
to
your
husbands
roof
is
an
added
reason
for
my
return
to
scartheybut
were
you
not
on
board
i
should
go
all
the
same
i
will
tell
you
why
it
is
a
secret
but
you
shall
know
it
i
have
treasures
on
board
vast
treasures
confided
to
me
and
i
must
store
them
in
safety
till
i
can
give
them
back
to
their
rightful
owners
this
i
can
only
do
at
scartheyfor
to
cruise
about
with
such
a
cargo
indefinitely
is
as
impossible
as
to
land
it
elsewhere
and
more
than
this
had
i
not
that
second
reason
i
have
yet
a
third
that
urges
me
to
scarthey
still
for
madeleine
she
whispered
and
her
teeth
gleamed
between
her
lips
he
remained
silent
and
tried
gently
to
disengage
himself
from
her
slender
fingers
but
the
feeling
of
their
frailness
the
knowledge
of
her
wound
made
her
feeble
grasp
as
an
iron
vice
to
his
manliness
she
came
closer
to
him
do
you
not
remember

she
has
said
to
you
what
she
wrote
to
you

cowardin
the
very
moment
when

were

your
life
for
love

her
i
remember
if
you
do
notyou
have
deceived
me
she
wrote
and
her
hand
never
trembled
for
the
words
ran
as
neatly
and
primly
as
ever
they
did
in

i
have

never

he
commanded
fiercely
and
wrenched
his
arm
away
to
face
her
with
menacing
eyes
ah
does
it
rouse
so
much
anger
in
you
even
to

repeated
what
she

not

it
in

she

she
stopped
drew
her
breath
with
a
long
gasp
the
spray
from
a
turbulent
wave
came
dashing
across
the
bows
into
her
face
and
as
once
the
blood
of
ccile

had
been
roused
by
the
call
of

her
doom
so
now
the
blood
she
had
transmitted
to
her
child
leaped
to
the
same
impulse
and
bore
her
onwards
with
irresistible
force
when
she
pursued
in
the
darkness
you
took
me
in
your
arms
and
kissed
me
what
did
the
touch
of
my
lips
bring
to
you
my
lips

that

for

the
wide

he
stood
before
her
and
the
sweat
that
had
gathered
upon
his
brow
ran
down
his
face
but
as
the
meaning
of
her
proposition
was
borne
in
upon
him
a
shudder
of
fury
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
no
man
should
have
offered
dishonour
to
jack
smith
and
not
have
been
struck
the
next
instant
at
his
feet
but
a
womana
woman
and
adrians
wife
lady
landale
he
said
after
a
silence
during
which
the
beating
of
her
heart
turned
her
sick
and
cold
and
all
her
fever
heat
fell
from
her
leaving
nothing
but
the
knowledge
of
her
shame
her
misery
her
hopeless
love
lady
landale
let
me
bring
you
back
to
your
cabinit
is
late
she
went
with
him
as
one
halfconscious
at
the
door
she
paused
the
light
from
within
fell
upon
his
face
deeply
troubled
and
white
but
upon
the
lips
and
brows
what
scorn
he
was
a
god
among
men
how
she
loved
him
and
he
scorned
her
poor
murthering
moll
she
looked
up
have
you
no
word
for
me
she
cried
passionately
only
this
lady
landale
i
will
forget





back
towards
the
distant
northern
light
the
schooner
clove
her
valiant
way
in
spite
of
adverse
winds
and
high
seas
the
return
journey
was
slower
than
the
outward
and
since
the
second
day
of
it
the
lady
kept
much
to
her
cabin
while
the
captain
would
pace
the
deck
till
far
into
the
night
with
unwonted
uneasiness
to
him
the
white
wings
of
his
peregrine
were
bearing
him
all
too
slowly
for
endurance
while
to
the
stormy
womans
heart
that
beat
through
the
night
watches
in
passionate
echo
to
his
restless
tread
every
instant
that
passed
but
brought
nearer
the
prospect
of
a
future
so
intolerable
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
face
it
a
gloom
seemed
to
have
come
over
the
tight
little
craft
and
to
have
spread
even
to
the
crew
who
missed
the
ring
of
their
captains
jolly
laugh
and
the
sound
of
his
song
when
within
a
days
sail
of
the
goal
the
planned
disguise
was
finally
carried
out
upon
the
schooners
fair
sides
and
rigging
her
beautiful
stretch
of
sail
curtailed
and
her
name
final
disgrace
superseded
by
the
unmeaning
title
of
the
pretty
jane
open
murmurs
broke
out
which
it
required
all
curwens
severityand
if
the
old
martinet
did
not
execute
the
summary
justice
he
had
threatened
he
was
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
neverthelessand
all
jacks
personal
influence
to
quell
the
dawn
of
the
next
day
crept
gloomily
upon
a
world
of
rain
with
long
faces
the
men
paddled
about
the
deck
doing
their
duty
in
silence
curwens
old
countenance
set
into
grimmer
lines
than
ever
looked
as
if
it
had
just
been
detached
from
the
prow
of
some
vessel
after
hard
experience
of
stress
and
storm
the
spirits
of
the
captain
alone
seemed
to
rise
in
proportion
as
they
drew
nearer
land
the
moon
sets
at
halfpast
eleven
he
said
to
curwen
but
we
need
not
fear
her
tonight
by
halfpast
twelve
i
reckon
on
your
having
those
twentyfive
damned
casks
safe
in
the
cave
you
took
them
from
it
is
a
matter
of
three
journeys
and
then
the
nose
of
the
pretty
jane
must
be
pointed
for
the
orkneys
alls
going
well





night
had
fallen
the
gaudy
bubbling
and
remorseful
day
had
crept
into
the
bosom
of
the
sea
from
the
crosstrees
the
lookout
man
had
already
been
able
to
distinguish
through
the
glass
the
faint
distant
glimmer
of
scarthey
beacon
when
captain
jack
knocked
for
admittance
at
lady
landales
cabin
for
the
last
time
as
he
thought
with
a
sigh
of
relief
in
the
course
of
an
hour
madam
he
said
in
a
grave
tone
i
hope
to
restore
you
to
land
as
for
me
i
shall
have
again
to
hide
in
the
peel
though
i
hope
it
will
not
be
for
long
my
fateand
by
my
fate
i
mean
not
only
my
safety
but
my
honour
which
as
you
know
is
now
bound
up
in
the
safety
of
the
treasureswill
be
in
your
hands
for
i
must
wait
at
scarthey
till
i
can
see
adrian
again
and
upon
your
return
to
pulwick
i
must
beg
you
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
ask
him
to
come
and
see
me
she
replied
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
i
will
not
fail
you
but
her
great
eyes
dark
circled
fixed
upon
him
with
a
meek
sorrowful
look
spoke
dumbly
the
troublous
tale
of
her
mind
in
her
subdued
mood
the
likeness
to
madeleine
was
more
obtrusive
than
it
had
ever
yet
been
he
contemplated
her
with
melancholy
and
drew
a
heavy
sigh
molly
groaned
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
though
her
lips
tight
set
betrayed
no
sound
oh
miserable
chaos
of
the
human
world
that
such
pent
up
love
should
be
wastedwasted
that
they
too
young
and
strong
and
beautiful
alone
together
so
near
with
such
glorious
happiness
within
their
reach
should
yet
be
so
perversely
far
asunder
there
was
a
long
silence
they
looked
into
each
others
eyes
but
he
was
unseeing
his
mind
was
far
away
dwelling
upon
the
memory
of
that
last
meeting
with
his
love
under
the
fir
trees
of
pulwick
only
ten
days
ago
but
now
as
irrevocably
far
as
things
seem
that
may
never
again
be
at
length
she
made
a
movement
which
brought
him
back
to
present
realitya
movement
of
her
wounded
arm
as
if
of
pain
and
he
came
back
to
lady
landale
worn
with
the
fatigue
of
these
long
days
in
the
cramped
discomfort
of
a
schooner
cabin
thinned
by
pain
and
fevered
thinkings
shorn
of
all
that
daintiness
of
appearance
which
can
only
be
maintained
in
the
midst
of
luxury
and
yet
by
the
light
of
the
flickering
lamp
more
triumphantly
beautiful
than
ever
his
thoughts
leaped
to
his
friend
with
a
pang
of
remorse
you
are
sufferingyou
are
ill
he
said
thus
do
i
bring
you
back
to
him
who
last
saw
you
so
full
of
strength
but
you
will
recover
at
pulwick
suffering
ill
ah
my
god
as
if
suffocating
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
bowed
her
head
till
it
rested
on
the
table
and
then
he
heard
her
murmur
in
a
weary
voice
recover
at
pulwick
my
god
my
god
the
air
at
pulwick
will
stifle
me
i
think
he
waited
a
moment
in
silence
and
saw
that
she
was
weeping
then
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
gentle
hand
nearly
all
the
lights
of
the
ship
were
now
extinguished
and
in
a
gloom
as
great
as
that
in
which
they
had
started
upon
their
unsuccessful
venture
the
peregrine
and
her
crew
returned
to
the
little
island
which
had
already
been
so
fateful
to
them
captain
jack
had
taken
the
helm
himself
and
curwen
stood
upon
his
right
hand
waiting
patiently
for
his
commands
for
an
hour
or
so
they
hung
off
the
shore
the
rain
fell
close
and
fine
around
them
it
was
as
if
sea
and
sky
were
merging
by
slow
imperceptible
degrees
into
one
the
beacon
light
looming
halo
encircled
through
the
mist
seemed
like
a
monster
eye
to
watch
with
unmoved
contempt
the
restlessness
of
these
pigmies
in
the
grand
solitude
of
the
night
who
shall
say
with
what
conflict
of
soul
molly
in
her
narrow
seclusion
saw
the
light
of
scarthey
grow
out
of
the
dimness
till
its
rays
fell
across
the
darkened
cabin
and
glimmered
on
her
wedding
ring
at
last
the
captain
drew
his
watch
and
by
the
faint
rays
upon
the
binnacle
saw
the
hour
had
come
boat
loaded
curwen
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
this
hour
sir
ready
to
cast
right
sir
now
curwen
low
from
man
to
man
the
order
ran
through
the
ship
and
the
anchor
was
dropped
almost
within
a
musket
shot
of
the
peel
it
was
high
tide
but
no
hand
but
captain
jacks
would
have
dared
risk
the
vessel
so
close
she
swung
round
ready
to
slip
at
a
moments
notice
he
left
the
helm
and
in
the
wet
darkness
cannoned
against
the
burly
figure
of
his
mate
you
curwen
remember
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
remain
hereas
soon
as
the
men
are
back
from
the
last
run
sheer
off
he
grasped
the
horny
hand
curwen
made
an
inarticulate
noise
in
his
big
throat
but
the
grip
of
his
fingers
upon
his
masters
was
of
eloquence
sufficient
let
some
one
call
the
lady
a
couple
of
men
ran
forward
with
dark
lanterns
the
rest
gathered
round
now
my
lads
brisk
and
silent
is
the
word
the
cabin
door
opened
and
molly
came
forth
the
darkness
hid
the
pallor
of
her
face
but
it
could
not
hide
the
faltering
of
her
steps
captain
jack
sprang
forward
and
gave
her
his
arm
and
she
leant
upon
it
without
speaking
heavily
for
one
moment
she
stopped
as
if
she
could
not
tear
her
feet
from
the
beloved
planks
but
curwen
caught
her
by
the
other
arm
and
then
she
was
on
the
swinging
ladder
and
so
she
left
the
peregrine





the
gig
was
almost
filled
with
barrels
there
was
only
room
for
the
four
oarsmen
selected
besides
the
captain
and
herself
the
boat
shoved
off
she
looked
back
and
saw
as
once
before
the
great
wall
of
the
ships
side
rise
sheer
above
the
sea
saw
the
triangle
of
light
again
slide
down
to
lie
a
span
above
the
waterline
with
what
a
leaping
heart
she
had
set
forth
that
black
night
away
from
the
hateful
lighthouse
beam
to
that
glimmer
of
promise
and
mystery
and
now
she
felt
herself
grow
sick
at
the
thought
of
that
homecoming
at
the
vision
of
the
close
warm
rooms
of
her
husbands
melancholy
eyes
yet
as
she
sat
the
sleeve
of
the
captains
rough
sailor
coat
touched
her
shoulder
and
she
remembered
she
was
still
with
him
it
was
not
all
death
yet
in
less
than
three
minutes
they
touched
ground
he
jumped
into
the
water
and
stretched
out
his
arms
for
molly
she
rose
giddily
and
his
embrace
folded
her
round
the
waves
rolled
in
with
surge
and
thud
and
dashed
their
spray
upon
them
and
still
the
rain
fell
and
beat
upon
her
head
from
which
she
had
impatiently
pushed
her
hood
but
her
spirit
had
no
heed
for
things
of
the
body
this
night
oh
if
the
sea
would
open
sudden
deeps
before
them
if
even
the
quicksand
would
seize
them
in
its
murderous
jaws
what
ecstasy
the
hideous
lingering
death
might
hold
for
her
so
that
only
she
lay
thus
in
his
arms
to
the
end
it
was
over
now
his
arms
had
clasped
her
for
the
last
time
she
stood
alone
upon
the
dry
sand
and
her
heart
was
in
hell
he
was
speaking
asking
her
pardon
for
not
going
at
once
with
her
to
see
her
into
the
keep
but
he
dared
not
leave
the
beach
till
his
cargo
was
landed
and
he
must
show
the
men
the
way
to
the
caves
would
she
forgive
him
would
she
go
with
him
forgive
him
go
with
him
she
almost
laughed
aloud
a
few
poor
moments
more
beside
him
they
would
be
as
the
drops
of
water
to
the
burning
tongue
of
dives
yes
she
would
go
with
him
one
by
one
the
precious
caskets
were
carried
between
a
couple
of
men
who
stumbled
in
the
darkness
close
on
their
captains
heels
and
the
lady
walked
beside
him
and
stood
beside
him
without
a
word
in
the
falling
rain
the
boat
went
backwards
and
forwards
twice
before
the
hour
had
run
out
the
luckless
cargo
was
all
once
more
landed
and
the
captain
heard
with
infinite
relief
the
last
oarstrokes
dwindling
away
in
the
distance
and
saw
the
lights
suddenly
disappear
you
have
been
very
patient
he
said
to
molly
then
with
a
gentle
note
in
his
voice
but
she
did
not
answer

of
the
damned

cried
captain
jack
looking
with
concern
at
lady
landale
who
in
truth
seemed
scarcely
able
to
stand
and
whose
fluctuating
colour
and
cracked
fevered
lips
gave
painful
corroboration
to
rens
surmise
your
mistress
must
be
instantly
attended
to
but
molly
arrested
the
servant
as
he
would
have
hurried
past
upon
his
errand

said

captain
jack
glanced
in
dismay
at
his
friends
wife
met
her
suddenly
illumined
gaze
and
turned
abruptly
on
his
heel
with
a
grinding
noise
see
to
your
mistress
he
said
harshly
i

your
women
folk

roused
overhead

them
and
when
lady
landale
no
longer

an
urgent
business
of
my
own
you
will
find

in
my
old
room

with
the
captain

goodnight
captain
smith
i
shall
see
you
tomorrow
there
was
a
wistful
query
in
her
voice
and
look
captain
smith
bowed
distantly
and
coldly
and
hastened
from
the
room
accompanied
by
ren
while
openmouthed
and
blinking
rosy
blowsy
and
amazed
mrs
potter
made
her
entry
on
the
scene
and
stared
at
her
mistress
with
the
roundest
of
blue
eyes





my
good
renny
said
the
captain
i
have
no
time
to
lose
i
have
a
hard
hours
work
to
do
before
i
can
even
think
of
talking
i
want
your
help
your
light
will
burn
all
safe
for
the
time
will
it
not
hark
ye
man
you
have
been
so
faithful
a
fellow
to
my
one
friend
that
i
am
going
to
trust
to
you
matters
which
concern
my
own
honour
and
my
own
life
ask
no
question
but
do
what
i
tell
you
if
you
would
help
one
who
has
helped
your
master
long
ago
one
whom
your
master
would
wish
you
to
help
thus
adjured
ren
repressed
his
growing
astonishment
at
the
incomprehensible
development
of
events
and
having
under
direction
provided
the
sailor
with
a
lantern
and
himself
with
a
wide
tarpaulin
and
sundry
carpenters
tools
he
followed
his
leader
readily
enough
through
the
ruinous
passages
half
choked
up
with
sand
which
led
from
the
interior
of
the
ruins
to
one
of
the
sea
caves
before
reaching
the
openmouthed
rocky
chamber
the
captain
obscured
the
light
and
ren
promptly
barked
his
shins
against
a
barrel
sacrebleu
he
cried
feeling
with
quick
hands
the
nature
of
the
obstruction
more
kegs
the
same
my
friend
now
hang
that
tarpaulin
against
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
be
sure
it
is
close
then
we
may
again
have
some
light
upon
the
matter
what
we
must
do
will
not
bear
interference
and
moving
glimmers
on
a
dark
night
have
told
tales
before
this
as
soon
as
the
beach
entrance
was
made
secure
the
captain
uncovered
his
lantern
and
as
the
double
row
of
kegs
stood
revealed
his
eyes
rapidly
scanned
their
number
yes
they
were
all
there
five
and
twenty
now
to
work
man
we
have
to
crack
every
one
of
these
nuts
and
take
the
kernels
out
even
as
he
spoke
he
turned
the
nearest
cask
on
end
with
a
blow
of
chisel
and
mallet
stove
in
the
head
and
began
dragging
out
quantities
of
loose
tow
in
the
centre
of
the
barrel
secured
in
position
on
to
a
stout
middle
batten
was
a
bag
of
sailcloth
closely
bound
with
cord
this
he
lifted
with
an
effort
for
it
was
over
a
hundredweight
and
flung
upon
the
sand
in
a
corner
thats
the
kernel
you
see
he
said
to
ren
who
had
watched
the
operation
with
keen
interest
and
when
we
have
shelled
them
all
i
will
show
you
where
to
put
them
in
safety
now
carry
onthe
quicker
the
better
the
sooner
we
have
it
all
upstairs
the
freer
i
shall
breathe
without
another
word
entering
into
the
spirit
of
haste
which
seemed
to
fill
his
companion
and
nobly
controlling
his
seething
curiosity
ren
set
to
work
on
his
side
with
his
usual
dexterousness
half
an
hour
of
speechless
destructive
labour
completed
the
first
part
of
the
task
then
the
two
men
carried
the
weighty
bags
into
the
room
which
had
been
captain
jacks
in
the
keep
and
when
they
had
travelled
to
and
fro
a
dozen
times
with
each
heavy
load
and
the
whole
treasure
was
at
length
accumulated
upstairs
ren
with
fresh
surprise
and
admiration
saw
the
captain
lift
the
hearthstone
and
disclose
a
recess
in
the
heavy
masonrypresumably
a
flue
in
the
living
days
of
scarthey
peelwhich
although
much
blocked
with
stony
rubbish
had
been
evidently
improved
by
the
last
lodger
during
his
period
of
solitary
residence
into
a
convenient
and
very
secure
hidingplace
here
was
the
precious
pyramid
now
heaped
up
the
stone
was
returned
to
its
place
and
the
two
stood
in
front
of
each
other
mopping
their
faces
thank
goodness
it
is
done
said
jack
smith
and
thank
you
too
renny
tomorrow
break
up
these
casks
and
add
the
staves
to
your
firewood
stack
then
nobody
but
you
in
this
part
of
the
world
need
be
any
the
wiser
about
our
nights
worka

running
ehphew
i
am
tired
bring
me
some
food
and
some
brandy
like
a
good
fellow
then
you
can
back
to
your
pillow
and
flatter
yourself
that
you
have
helped
jack
smith
out
of
a
famous
quandary
ren
grinned
and
rushed
to
execute
the
order
he
had
less
desire
for
his
pillow
than
for
the
gratification
of
his
hyperexcited
curiosity
but
although
pressed
to
quaff
one
cup
of
good
fellowship
and
yet
another
he
was
not
destined
to
get
his
information
that
night
from
the
captain
who
had
much
ado
to
strangle
his
yawns
sufficiently
to
swallow
a
mouthful
or
two
of
food
no
one
must
know
renny
was
all
he
said
at
last
between
two
gapes
kicking
the
hearthstone
significantly
and
stretching
his
arms
not
even
the
wife
then
he
flung
himself
all
dressed
upon
his
bed
and
my
faith
said
ren
when
he
sought
his
wife
a
moment
later
he
was
fast
asleep
before
i
had
closed
the
door
chapter
xxviii
the
end
of
the
thread
madeleine
had
appeared
greatly
distressed
at
the
thought
that
through
her
her
sister
was
now
in
so
doubtful
and
precarious
a
situation
it
was
part
of
her
punishment
she
told
herself
for
her
sins
of
deceit
and
unmaidenliness
in
encouraging
and
meeting
a
clandestine
lover
she
had
gone
through
some
very
bitter
hours
since
her
tryst
at
the
ruins
the
process
of
cutting
off
a
malignant
growth
that
has
become
part
of
oneself
is
none
the
less
painful
because
the
conviction
is
clear
that
it
is
for
ones
health
to
do
so
and
the
will
is
firm
not
to
falter
not
the
less
is
the
flesh
mangled
do
nerves
throb
and
veins
bleed
but
madeleine
was
determined
that
nobody
should
even
guess
her
sufferings
rupert
had
counted
upon
sophias
old
habit
of
obedience
to
him
and
upon
her
superstitious
terrors
not
to
betray
to
the
young
girl
the
part
he
had
played
in
the
unmasking
of
her
lover
but
he
had
an
unexpected
and
even
more
powerful
ally
in
madeleines
own
pride
when
miss
sophia
had
tremblingly
endeavoured
to
falter
out
a
few
words
of
sympathy
and
sorrow
upon
the
distressing
subject
madeleine
quickly
interrupted
her
never
speak
even
his
name
again
sophia
all
that
is
finished
for
me
there
was
such
a
cold
finality
in
her
voice
that
the
poor
confidants
expansiveness
withered
up
within
her
beyond
even
the
hope
of
blossoming
again
when
rupert
heard
of
captain
jacks
latest
doings
and
especially
of
his
sisterinlaws
disappearance
he
thought
that
the
fates
were
propitious
indeed
in
his
wildest
schemes
he
could
not
have
planned
anything
that
would
have
suited
his
game
more
perfectly
though
he
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
pull
a
face
of
desperate
length
whenever
the
subject
was
touched
in
his
innermost
soul
he
had
hardly
ever
enjoyed
so
delightful
a
joke
as
this
dnouement
to
his
brothers
marriage
and
to
his
cousins
engagement
and
strange
to
say
though
he
would
most
gravely
protest
against
any
interpretation
of
his
kinswomans
disappearance
save
the
one
which
must
most
redound
to
her
credit
the
story
started
by
the
gossips
in
the
village
upon
the
return
of
the
revenue
men
that
lady
landale
had
bolted
with
the
handsome
smuggler
grew
and
spread
apace
all
over
the
county
more
especially
from
such
houses
as
rupert
was
wont
to
visit
that
all
his
hints
and
innuendoes
should
fail
apparently
to
make
madeleine
put
upon
the
case
the
interpretation
he
would
have
liked
was
at
once
a
matter
of
secret
sneering
and
of
admiration
to
his
curiously
complicated
mind
the
days
went
by
to
all
appearance
placidly
enough
for
the
trio
at
pulwick
madeleine
shunned
none
of
the
usages
of
life
in
common
worked
and
talked
with
sophia
of
a
morning
rode
or
walked
out
with
rupert
of
an
afternoon
and
passed
the
evening
at
her
embroidery
frame
meeting
his
efforts
to
entertain
her
as
amiably
as
before
rupert
thought
he
knew
enough
of
the
human
heart
and
more
especially
the
feminine
to
draw
satisfactory
conclusions
from
this
behaviour
for
a
girl
to
bear
no
malice
to
the
man
who
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
demonstrate
to
her
the
unworthiness
of
her
lover
argued
to
his
mind
that
her
affections
could
not
have
been
very
deeply
engaged
in
that
quarter
it
was
clear
that
she
felt
gratitude
for
a
timely
rescue
nay
might
he
not
go
further
and
lay
the
flattering
unction
to
his
soul
that
she
would
not
be
unwilling
to
transfer
these
same
blighted
feelings
to
a
more
suitable
recipient
a
slight
incident
which
took
place
a
few
nights
later
tended
still
more
to
increase
the
kindness
of
madeleines
manner
to
him
upon
the
next
day
but
this
was
for
a
reason
that
he
little
suspected
it
had
been
an
anniversary
with
sophianone
less
indeed
than
that
of
the
lamented
rectors
demise
when
her
young
cousin
had
retired
to
her
room
the
desire
to
pursue
her
thither
with
a
packet
of
old
letters
and
other
treasures
exhumed
from
the
depths
of
her
cupboards
had
proved
too
strong
for
a
soul
burning
for
congenial
sympathy
and
sophia
had
spent
a
couple
of
very
delightful
hours
pouring
forth
reminiscences
and
lamentations
into
the
bosom
of
one
who
as
she
said
she
knew
could
understand
her
madeleine
a
little
wearied
stifling
a
sigh
or
a
yawn
as
the
minutes
ticked
by
was
too
gentle
too
kindhearted
to
repel
the
faithful
if
loquacious
mourner
so
she
had
sat
and
listened
which
was
all
that
sophia
required
upon
the
stroke
of
twelve
miss
landale
rose
at
length
collected
her
relics
and
mopping
her
swollen
eyes
embraced
her
cousin
and
bade
her
goodnight
with
much
effusion
while
with
cordial
alacrity
the
latter
conducted
her
to
the
door
but
here
sophia
paused
holding
the
flat
silver
candlestick
with
one
hand
with
the
other
clasping
to
her
bosom
her
bundle
of
superannuated
love
letters
she
glanced
out
into
the
long
black
chasm
of
corridor
with
a
shudder
and
vowed
she
had
not
the
courage
to
traverse
it
alone
at
such
an
hour
she
cast
as
she
spoke
such
a
meaning
glance
at
madeleines
great
bed
that
trembling
lest
her
next
words
should
be
a
proposal
to
share
it
for
the
night
the
young
girl
hurriedly
volunteered
to
reconduct
her
to
her
own
apartment
half
way
down
the
passage
they
had
to
pass
the
door
of
the
picture
gallery
which
was
ajar
disclosing
light
within
at
the
sight
of
rupert
standing
with
his
back
to
them
looking
fixedly
at
the
picture
upon
the
opposite
wall
sophia
promptly
thought
better
of
the
scream
she
was
preparing
and
seized
her
cousin
by
the
arm
come
away
come
away
she
whispered
he
will
be
much
displeased
if
he
sees
us
madeleine
allowed
herself
to
be
pulled
onward
but
remembering
mollys
previous
encounter
upon
the
same
spot
was
curious
enough
to
demand
an
explanation
of
ruperts
nocturnal
rambles
when
they
had
reached
the
haven
of
sophias
bedroom
it
was
very
simple
but
it
struck
her
as
exceedingly
pathetic
and
confirmed
her
in
her
opinion
of
the
unreasonableness
of
her
sisters
dislike
to
rupert
he
was
gazing
at
his
dead
wifes
picture
he
could
not
bear
sophia
said
for
any
one
to
find
him
there
could
not
bear
the
smallest
allusion
to
his
grief
but
at
night
as
she
had
herself
discovered
quite
by
accident
he
would
often
spend
long
spells
as
they
had
just
seen
him
there
was
something
in
madeleines
own
nature
a
susceptible
proud
reserve
which
made
this
trait
in
her
cousins
character
thoroughly
congenial
moreover
what
woman
is
not
drawn
with
pity
towards
the
man
who
can
so
mourn
a
woman
she
met
him
therefore
the
next
day
with
a
softness
almost
a
tenderness
of
look
and
smile
which
roused
his
highest
hopes
and
when
he
proposed
after
breakfast
that
they
should
profit
by
the
mild
weather
to
stroll
in
the
garden
while
sophia
was
busy
in
the
house
she
willingly
consented
up
the
gravel
paths
between
the
gooseberry
bushes
to
the
violet
beds
they
went
it
was
one
of
those
balmy
days
that
come
sometimes
in
early
spring
and
encourage
all
sorts
of
false
hopes
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
vegetables
a
growing
day
the
farmers
call
them
indeed
at
such
times
you
may
almost
hear
the
swelling
and
the
bursting
of
the
buds
the
rising
of
the
sap
the
throbbing
and
pushing
of
the
young
green
life
all
around
madeleine
grew
hot
with
the
weight
of
her
fur
tippet
the
pale
face
under
the
plumy
hat
took
an
unusual
pink
bloom
her
eyes
shone
with
a
moist
radiance
rupert
glancing
up
at
her
as
bent
upon
one
knee
he
sought
for
stray
violets
amid
the
thick
green
leaves
thought
it
was
thus
a
maiden
looked
who
waited
to
be
won
and
though
all
of
true
love
that
he
could
ever
give
to
woman
lay
buried
with
his
little
bride
he
felt
his
pulses
quicken
with
a
certain
sthetic
pleasure
in
the
situation
presently
he
rose
and
after
arranging
his
bunch
of
purple
sweetness
into
dainty
form
offered
it
silently
to
his
companion
she
took
it
smiling
and
carried
it
mechanically
to
her
face
oh
the
scent
of
the
violets
upon
the
most
delicate
yet
mighty
pinions
she
was
carried
back
despite
all
her
proud
resolves
to
that
golden
hour
only
five
days
ago
when
she
lay
upon
her
lovers
broad
breast
and
heard
the
beating
of
his
heart
beneath
her
ear
again
she
felt
his
arm
around
her
so
strong
yet
so
gentle
saw
his
handsome
face
bent
towards
her
closerever
closerfelt
again
the
tide
of
joy
that
coursed
through
her
veins
in
the
expectation
of
his
kiss
no
no
she
must
notshe
would
not
yield
to
this
degrading
folly
if
it
were
not
yet
dead
then
she
must
kill
it
she
had
first
grown
pale
but
the
next
moment
a
deep
crimson
flooded
her
face
she
turned
her
head
away
and
rupert
saw
her
tremble
as
she
dropped
the
hand
that
held
the
flowers
close
clenched
by
her
side
he
formed
his
own
opinion
of
what
was
passing
within
her
and
it
made
even
his
cold
blood
course
hotly
in
his
veins
madeleine
he
said
with
low
rapid
utterance
i
am
not
mistaken
i
trust
in
thinking
you
look
on
me
as
a
good
friend
indeed
yes
answered
the
girl
with
an
effort
turning
her
tremulous
face
towards
him
a
good
friend
indeed
had
he
not
been
so
five
days
ago
aye
most
truly
and
she
would
have
it
so
in
spite
of
the
hungry
voice
within
her
which
had
awaked
and
cried
out
against
the
knowledge
that
had
brought
such
misery
he
saw
her
set
her
little
teeth
and
toss
her
head
and
knew
she
was
thinking
of
the
adventurer
who
had
dared
aspire
to
her
and
he
gained
warmer
courage
still
nothing
more
than
a
friend
sweet
a
kind
cousin
almost
a
brother
no
no
not
a
brother
madeleine
nay
hear
me
taking
her
hands
and
looking
into
her
uncomprehending
eyes
i
would
not
be
a
brother
but
something
closer
dearer
we
are
both
alone
in
the
world
more
or
less
whom
have
you
but

let
us
join
our
loneliness
and
make
of
it
a
beautiful
and
happy
home
madeleine
i
have
learned
to
love
you
deeply
his
eyes
glowed
between
their
narrowing
eyelids
his
voice
rang
changes
upon
chords
of
most
exquisite
tenderness
his
whole
manner
was
charged
with
a
courtly
reverence
mingled
with
the
subtlest
hint
of
passion
rupert
as
a
lover
had
not
a
flaw
in
him
yet
fear
suspicion
disgust
chased
each
other
in
madeleines
mind
in
quick
succession
what
did
he
mean
how
could
it
be
that
he
loved
her
oh
if
this
had
been
his
purpose
what
motive
was
prompting
him
when
he
divided
her
from
her
deceiving
lover
was
no
one
true
then
was
this
the
inconsolable
widower
whose
grief
she
had
been
so
sympathetically
considering
all
the
morning
for
whose
disinterested
anxiety
and
solicitude
on
her
behalf
her
sore
heart
had
forced
itself
to
render
gratitude
oh
how
terrible
it
all
was

what
a
hateful
world
well
madeleine
he
pressed
forward
and
slid
his
arm
around
her
all
her
powers
of
thought
and
action
restored
by
the
deed
she
disengaged
herself
with
a
movement
of
unconscious
repulsion

i
am
sure
you
mean
kindly
by
me
but
it
is
quite
impossiblei
shall
never

he
drew
back
as
nonplussed
as
if
she
had
struck
him
in
the
face
pshaw
my
dear
madeleine
please
cousin
rupert
no
more
my
dear
girl
i
have
been
precipitate
nothing
can
make
any
difference
that
i
could
never
marry
you
so
much
you
must
believe
that
i
shall
never
marry
at
all
you
are
free
to
believe
or
not
as
you
please
i
am
sorry
you
should
have
spoken
still
hankering
after
that
beggarly
scoundrel
muttered
rupert
a
sneer
uncovering
his
teeth
betrayed
hideously
the
ungenerous
soul
within
he
was
too
deeply
mortified
too
shaken
by
this
utter
shattering
of
his
last
ambitions
to
be
able
to
grasp
his
usual
selfcontrol
madeleine
gave
him
one
proud
glance
turned
abruptly
away
and
walked
into
the
house
she
went
steadily
up
to
her
room
and
once
there
without
hesitation
proceeded
to
unlock
a
drawer
in
her
writingtable
and
draw
from
it
a
little
ribbontied
parcel
of
lettersjacks
letters
her
heart
had
failed
her
womanlike
before
the
little
sacrifice
when
she
had
unshrinkingly
accomplished
the
larger
one
now
however
with
determined
hand
she
threw
the
letters
into
the
reddest
cavern
of
her
woodfire
and
with
hard
dry
eyes
watched
them
burn
when
the
last
scrap
had
writhed
and
fluttered
and
flamed
into
grey
ash
she
turned
to
her
altar
and
extending
her
arm
called
out
aloud
i
have
done
with
it
all
for
ever
and
the
next
instant
flinging
herself
upon
her
bed
she
drew
her
brown
ringlets
before
her
face
and
under
this
veil
wept
for
her
broken
youth
and
her
broken
heart
and
the
hard
cold
life
before
her





there
is
a
kind
of
love
a
man
can
give
to
woman
but
once
in
his
lifetime
the
love
of
the
man
in
the
first
flush
of
manhood
for
the
woman
he
has
chosen
to
be
his
mate
untransferable
and
never
to
be
forgotten
love
of
passion
so
exquisite
of
devotion
so
pure
born
of
the
youth
of
the
heart
and
belonging
to
an
existence
and
personality
lost
for
ever
a
man
may
wed
again
and
some
say
love
again
but
between
the
boards
of
the
coffin
of
his
first
wifeif
he
has
loved
herlie
secrets
of
tenderness
and
sweetness
and
delight
which
like
the
spring
flowers
may
not
visit
the
later
year
but
notwithstanding
this
a
second
wooing
may
have
a
charm
and
an
interest
of
its
own
even
the
wooing
which
is
to
precede
a
marriage
of
convenience
so
rupert
found
the
thought
of
an
alliance
with
madeleine
de
savenaye
was
not
only
engrossing
from
the
sense
of
its
own
intrinsic
advantages
but
had
become
the
actual
foundationstone
of
all
his
new
schemes
of
ambition
nay
more
such
admiration
and
desire
as
he
could
still
feel
for
woman
he
had
gradually
come
to
centre
upon
his
fair
and
graceful
cousin
who
added
to
her
personal
attractions
the
other
indispensable
attributes
blood
breeding
and
fortune
mr
landale
was
as
essentially
refined
and
fastidious
in
his
judgment
as
he
was
unmeasured
in
his
ambition
his
error
of
precipitancy
had
been
pardonable
enough
and
mere
selfreproach
for
an
illconsidered
manoeuvre
would
not
have
sufficed
to
plunge
him
into
such
a
depth
of
bitter
and
angry
despondency
as
that
in
which
he
now
found
himself
but
the
rebuff
had
been
too
uncompromising
to
leave
him
a
single
hope
he
was
too
shrewd
not
to
see
that
here
was
no
pretty
feminine
nay
precursor
of
the
yielding
yea
not
to
realise
that
madeleine
had
meant
what
she
said
and
would
abide
by
it
and
under
the
sting
of
the
moment
betrayed
into
a
degradingly
illmannered
outburst
he
had
shown
that
he
measured
the
full
bearings
of
the
position
so
the
wind
still
sat
in
that
quarter
failing
the
mysterious
smuggler
it
was
to
be
nobody
with
the
savenaye
heiressand
least
of
all
rupert
landale
and
this
though
the
scoundrel
had
been
thoroughly
shown
up
though
he
had
started
upon
his
illegal
venture
and
was
gone
never
to
return
if
he
valued
his
neck
after
murdering
four
officers
of
the
crown
and
sinking
a
kings
vessel
though
he
had
carried
away
with
him
ah
there
was
consolation
in
that
excellent
jest
which
had
so
far
developed
into
sir
adrians
wild
goose
chase
to
france
and
might
still
hold
some
delicate
dnouement
had
carried
with
him
no
less
a
person
than
lady
landale
herself
the
fellow
had
good
taste
and
either
of
the
sisters
was
a
dainty
morsel
he
still
left
the
baneful
trail
of
his
influence
behind
him
upon
the
girl
he
had
deluded
and
beguiled
rupert
landale
who
for
motives
of
his
own
had
pleased
himself
by
hunting
down
madeleines
lover
had
felt
in
the
keenness
of
his
bloodhound
work
something
of
the
bloodhound
instinct
of
destruction
and
ferocity
spring
up
within
him
before
he
had
even
set
eyes
on
his
quarry
and
the
day
they
had
stood
face
to
face
this
instinctive
hatred
had
been
intensified
by
some
singular
natural
antagonism
added
to
this
there
was
now
personal
injury
and
the
prey
was
out
of
reach
impotence
for
revenge
burned
into
the
soul
of
him
like
a
corrosive
poison
oh
let
him
but
come
within
his
grip
again
and
he
should
not
escape
so
easily
sits
the
wind
still
in
that
quarter
the
burthen
droned
in
his
head
angry
conclusion
to
each
long
spell
of
inconclusive
thought
as
he
still
paced
the
garden
till
the
noon
hour
began
to
wane
and
it
was
in
this
mood
that
at
length
returning
to
his
study
he
crossed
in
one
of
the
back
passages
a
young
woman
enveloped
in
a
brilliant
scarlet
and
black
shawl
who
started
in
evident
dismay
on
being
confronted
with
him
rupert
knew
by
sight
and
name
every
wench
of
kitchen
and
laundry
as
well
as
every
one
of
the
buxom
lasses
or
dames
whom
business
brought
periodically
to
the
great
hall
that
this
person
was
neither
of
the
household
nor
one
of
the
usual
backdoor
visitors
he
would
have
seen
at
a
glance
even
had
not
her
own
embarrassment
drawn
his
closer
attention
he
looked
keenly
and
recognised
the
gatekeepers
daughter
moggie
having
married
sir
adrians
servant
and
withdrawn
to
take
up
her
abode
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
so
to
speak
she
was
not
one
whom
mr
landale
would
have
regarded
with
favour
in
any
case
but
now
concentrating
his
thoughts
from
their
aimless
whirl
of
dissatisfaction
upon
the
present
encounter
he
was
struck
by
the
womans
manner
yes
she
was
most
undoubtedly
frightened
he
examined
her
with
a
malevolent
eye
which
still
discountenanced
her
and
though
he
made
no
inquiry
she
forthwith
stammered
out
ii
came
sir
to
see
if
there
be
news
of
her
ladyship

or
of
sir
adrian
sirrenny
cant
leave
the
island
you
know
and
he
be
downright
anxious
well
my
good
woman
calm
yourself
nothing
wrong
nothing
to
hide
in
this
very
laudable
anxiety
of
you
and
your
good
man
no
we
have
no
news
yetthat
is
quickly
told
mrs
potter
he
kept
her
for
a
moment
quailing
and
scared
under
his
cruel
gaze
then
went
on
his
way
working
upon
the
new
problems
she
had
brought
him
to
solve
no
matter
was
too
small
for
ruperts
mind
he
knew
how
inextricably
the
most
minute
and
apparently
insignificant
may
be
connected
with
the
most
important
events
of
life
the
woman
was
singularly
anxious
to
explain
reflected
he
pausing
at
his
chamber
door
singularly
ready
with
her
explanationtoo
ready
she
must
have
lied
no
doubt
she
lied
liar
was
written
upon
every
line
of
the
terrified
face
of
her
what
was
that
infernal
little
french
husband
of
hers
hatching
now
he
had
been
in
the
smith
plot
of
course
ah
curse
that
smuggling
fellow
he
cropped
up
still
on
every
side
pray
the
fates
he
would
crop
up
once
too
often
for
his
own
safety
yet
who
knew
meanwhile
mrs
potter
the
innocent
newsgatherer
must
not
be
allowed
to
roam
unwatched
at
her
own
sweet
will
about
the
place
hark
what
clumping
creaking
steps
these
could
only
be
produced
by
rens
fairyfooted
spouse
the
house
servants
had
been
too
well
drilled
by
his
irritable
ear
to
venture
in
such
shoe
leather
within
its
range
he
closed
his
door
and
gently
walked
back
along
the
corridor
as
he
passed
mollys
apartment
he
could
hear
the
creaking
of
a
wardrobe
door
and
a
startling
surmise
springing
into
his
brain
he
quietly
slipped
into
an
opposite
room
and
waited
leaving
the
door
slightly
ajar
as
he
expected
a
few
minutes
later
moggie
reappeared
loaded
with
a
bulky
parcel
glancing
anxiously
right
and
left
she
tiptoed
by
him
but
after
a
few
steps
suddenly
turning
her
head
once
more
met
his
eyes
grimly
fixed
upon
her
through
the
narrow
aperture
with
a
faint
squeal
she
paddled
off
as
though
a
fiend
were
at
her
heels
something
more
than
anxiety
for
news
there
mrs
potter
said
mr
landale
apostrophising
the
retreating
figure
with
a
malignant
inward
laugh
then
when
the
last
echo
of
her
stout
boots
had
faded
away
he
entered
his
sisterinlaws
room
looked
around
and
meditatively
began
to
open
various
presses
and
drawers
you
visited
this
one
at
any
rate
my
girl
thought
he
as
he
recognised
the
special
sound
of
the
hinges
and
for
a
ladys
maid
you
have
left
it
in
singular
disorder
as
for
this
pulling
open
a
linen
drawer
halfemptied
and
showing
dainty
feminine
apparel
beribboned
and
belaced
in
the
most
utter
disorderwhy
fie
on
you
mrs
potter
is
this
the
way
to
treat
these
pretty
things
he
had
seen
enough
he
paused
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
nails
to
his
lips
smiling
to
himself
ah
mrs
potter
i
fancy
you
might
have
given
us
a
little
news
yourself
most
unkind
of
my
lady
landale
to
prefer
to
keep
us
in
this
unnatural
anxietymost
unkind
indeed
she
must
have
singularly
good
reasons
for
so
doing
captain
smith
my
friend
mr
cochrane
or
whatever
may
be
your
name
we
have
an
account
to
settle
and
there
is
that
fool
of
an
adrian
scurrying
over
the
seas
in
search
of
his
runaway
wife
by
george
my
hand
is
not
played
out
yet
slowly
he
repaired
to
his
study
there
he
sat
down
and
wrote
without
any
further
reflection
an
urgent
letter
to
the
chief
officer
of
the
newly
established
preventive
service
station
then
he
rang
the
bell
one
of
the
grooms
will
ride
at
once
to
lancaster
with
this
he
said
to
the
servant
looking
at
the
missive
in
his
hand
but
instead
of
delivering
it
he
paused
a
new
idea
had
occurred
how
many
of
these
servants
might
not
be
leagued
in
favour
of
that
interloper
bribed
or
knowing
him
perhaps
to
have
been
a
friend
of
sir
adrian
or
yet
again
out
of
sheer
spite
to
himself
no
he
would
leave
no
loophole
for
treachery
now
send
the
groom
to
me
as
soon
as
he
is
ready
he
continued
and
when
the
footman
had
withdrawn
enclosed
the
letter
with
its
taletelling
superscription
in
another
directed
to
a
local
firm
of
attorneys
with
a
covering
note
instructing
them
to
see
that
the
communication
on
his
majestys
service
should
reach
the
proper
hands
without
delay
when
the
messenger
had
set
forth
mr
landale
on
his
side
had
his
horse
saddled
and
sallied
out
in
the
direction
of
scarthey
sands
as
from
the
top
of
the
bluff
he
took
a
survey
of
the
great
bay
a
couple
of
figures
crossing
the
strand
in
the
distance
arrested
his
attention
he
reined
in
his
horse
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
and
watched
so
ho
mrs
potter
your
careful
husband
could
not
leave
the
island
muttered
he
as
he
marked
the
unmistakable
squat
figure
of
the
one
a
man
carrying
a
burden
upon
his
shoulder
whilst
enveloping
the
woman
who
walked
briskly
by
his
side
flared
the
brillianthued
shawl
of
moggie
that
lie
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
to
arouse
suspicion
hallo
what
is
the
damned
crapaud
up
to
the
question
was
suggested
by
the
mans
movements
as
after
returning
the
parcel
to
his
consort
at
the
beginning
of
the
now
bare
causeway
he
turned
tail
while
she
trudged
forward
alone
the
shearmans
house
i
thought
as
much
out
he
comes
again
and
not
by
himself
i
have
made
acquaintance
with
those
small
bare
legs
before
i
should
have
been
astonished
indeed
if
none
of
the
shearman
fellows
had
been
mixed
up
with
the
affair
i
shall
be
even
yet
with
those
creditable
friends
of
yours
brother
adrian
so
its
you
again
johnny
my
lad
the
pretty
mercury
can
it
be
possible
that
captain
smith
is
at
his
old
games
once
more
mr
landales
eyes
shone
with
a
curious
eager
light
he
laughed
a
little
mirthless
laugh
which
was
neither
pleasant
to
hear
nor
to
give
dear
me
he
said
aloud
as
he
watched
the
pair
tramp
together
towards
scarthey
for
plotters
in
the
dark
you
are
particularly
easy
to
detect
my
good
friends
then
he
checked
himself
realising
what
a
mere
chance
it
had
been
after
alla
fortuitous
meeting
in
the
passagethat
had
first
aroused
his
suspicions
and
placed
between
his
fingers
the
end
of
the
thread
he
now
thought
it
so
simple
to
follow
up
but
he
did
hold
the
thread
and
depended
no
longer
upon
chance
or
guesswork
but
on
his
own
relentless
purpose
to
lay
the
plotters
by
the
heels
whatever
their
plot
might
be
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
johnny
shearman
whistling
lighthearted
and
alone
was
nearing
his
native
house
once
more
when
the
sight
of
a
horseman
rapidly
advancing
across
the
sands
brought
him
to
a
standstill
to
stare
with
a
boys
curiosity
presently
however
recognising
mr
landalea
person
for
whom
he
had
more
dread
than
admirationhe
was
starting
off
homeward
again
at
a
brisk
canter
when
a
stern
hail
from
the
rider
arrested
him
johnny
the
boy
debated
a
moment
measured
the
distance
between
the
cottage
and
himself
and
shrewdly
recognised
the
advisability
of
obeying
johnny
my
boy
i
want
you
at
the
hall
take
hold
of
my
stirrup
and
come
along
with
me
the
boy
with
every
symptom
of
reluctance
demurred
pleading
a
promise
to
return
to
his
mother
then
he
suddenly
perceived
a
look
in
the
gentlemans
eye
which
gave
him
a
frantic
unreasoned
desire
to
bolt
at
once
and
at
any
cost
but
the
horseman
anticipated
the
thought
bending
in
the
saddle
he
reached
out
his
arm
and
seized
the
urchin
by
the
collar
why
you
little
devil
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
grinning
ominously
into
the
chubby
terrified
face
it
strikes
me
it
is
time
you
and
i
should
come
to
a
little
understanding
any
more
letters
from
the
smuggler
today
eh
ah
would
you
you
young
idiot
and
mr
landales
fingers
gave
a
sudden
twist
to
the
collar
which
strangled
the
rising
yell
listen
johnny
tightening
his
grasp
gradually
until
the
brown
face
grew
scarlet
then
purple
and
the
goggling
eyes
seemed
to
start
out
of
their
sockets
that
is
what
it
feels
like
to
be
hanged
they
squeeze
your
neck
so
and
they
leave
you
dangling
at
the
end
of
a
rope
till
you
are
dead
dead
dead
and
the
crows
come
and
eat
you
do
you
want
to
be
hanged
for
some
moments
more
he
kept
the
writhing
lad
under
the
torture
then
loosening
his
grip
without
however
relinquishing
his
hold
allowed
him
to
taste
once
more
the
living
air
do
you
want
to
be
hanged
johnny
shearman
he
asked
again
gravely
the
lad
burst
into
gasping
sobs
and
looked
up
at
his
captor
with
an
agony
of
fear
in
his
bloodshot
eyes
no
continued
mr
landale
i
am
sure
you
dont
eh
with
a
renewed
ominous
contraction
of
the
hand
its
a
fearful
thing
is
hanging
and
yet
many
a
lad
hardly
older
than
you
has
been
hanged
for
less
than
you
are
doing
magistrates
can
get
people
hanged
and

that
noise

the
gentleman
there
are
one
or
two
little
things
i
want
to
know
myself
johnny
and
its
just
possible
i
might
let
you
off
for
this
time
if
by
chance
you
were
able
to
tell
them
to
me
so
for
your
sake
i
hope
you
may
be
he
could
see
that
the
boys
mind
was
now
completely
turned
with
fright
if
you
were
to
try
to
run
away
again
i
should
know
you
had
secrets
to
keep
from
me
and
then
johnny
shearman
it
would
go
hard
with
you
indeed
now
come
along
beside
me
up
to
the
hall
quite
certain
of
his
prey
he
released
him
and
setting
his
horse
to
a
trot
smiled
to
note
the
desperate
clutch
of
the
lad
upon
his
stirrup
leather
as
with
the
perspiration
dripping
from
his
face
and
panting
breath
he
struggled
to
keep
up
the
pace
alongside
marched
with
tremendous
ceremony
into
the
magistrates
study
and
directed
to
stand
right
opposite
the
light
while
mr
landale
installed
himself
in
an
armchair
with
a
bloodcurdling
air
of
judicial
sternness
johnny
shearman
at
most
times
as
daredevil
a
pickle
of
a
boy
as
ever
ran
but
now
reduced
to
a
state
of
mental
and
physical
jelly
underwent
a
terrible
crossexamination
it
was
comparatively
little
that
he
had
to
say
and
no
doubt
he
wished
most
fervently
he
had
greater
revelations
to
make
and
could
thus
propitiate
the
arbiter
of
the
appalling
fate
he
firmly
believed
might
lie
in
store
for
him
meagre
as
his
narrative
was
however
it
quite
sufficed
for
mr
landale
i
think
johnny
he
said
more
pleasantly
well
knowing
the
inducement
that
a
sudden
relaxation
from
fear
offers
to
a
witnesss
garrulity
i
think
i
may
say
you
will
not
hang
this
timethat
is
with
a
sudden
hardening
of
his
voice
and
making
a
great
show
of
checking
the
answers
with
pen
and
ink
in
his
most
magisterial
manner
that
is
if
you
have
really
told
me
all
you
know
and
it
be
all
true

if

the

there
was
a
special
cell
off
the
official
study
with
high
windows
bolts
and
bars
and
a
wooden
bench
for
the
temporary

desperate
criminals

the

he
now
disposed
of
the
young
offender
who
snivelled
piteously
once
more
and
having
locked
the
door
and
pocketed
the
key
returned
to
his
capacious
armchair
where
as
the
twilight
waned
over
the
land
he
fell
to
coordinating
his
scheme
and
gloating
upon
this
unexpected
turn
of
fortunes
wheel





at
that
hour
madeleine
alone
in
her
chamber
knelt
before
her
little
altar
wrestling
with
the
rebellion
of
her
soul
and
besieging
the
heavens
with
a
cry
for
peace





sir
adrian
having
failed
to
hear
aught
of

with

lady
landale
torn
between
the
dread
of
a
final
separation
from
the
loadstar
of
her
existence
and
the
gnawing
anxiety
roused
in
her
bosom
by

account
of
mr

watchfulness
was
pacing
the
long
booklined
room
with
the
restlessness
of
a
caged
panther





on
the
road
from
lancaster
to
pulwick
a
posse
of
riding
officers
and
a
carriage
full
of
hastily
gathered
preventive
men
were
trotting
on
their
way
to
the
priory
chapter
xxix
the

out
the
light
of
scarthey
had
not
been
shining
for
quite
an
hour
over
the
wilderness
when
lady
landale
suddenly
breaking
the
chain
of
her
restless
tramp
ran
to
the
door
and
called
for
moggie
there
was
so
shrill
a
tone
of
anguish
in
the
summons
that
the
young
woman
rushed
into
the
room
in
trembling
expectancy
yet
it
was
to
find
her
mistress
alone
and
the
place
undisturbed
moggie
said
lady
landale
panting
and
pressing
her
hands
upon
her
side
as
if
in
the
endeavour
to
control
the
beating
of
her
heart
something
is
going
to
happen
i
know
it
i
feel
it
tell
captain
smith
that
i
must
speak
to
him

at
once
infected
by
the
terror
upon
her
mistresss
face
madame
laptre
flew
upon
her
errand
a
moment
later
captain
jack
entered
the
room
and
stood
before
lady
landale
with
a
look
of
impatient
inquiry
oh
it
is
wicked
it
is
mad
cried
she
passionately
it
is
tempting
god
to
remain
here
of
whom
are
you
speaking
he
asked
with
an
involuntary
glance
of
contempt
at
the
distracted
figure
if
it
is
of
yourself
i
entirely
concur
how
often
these
last
days
and
how
earnestly
have
i
not
begged
of
you
to
return
to
pulwick
was
not
the
situation
you
placed
me
in
with
regard
to
adrian
already
odious
enough
that
it
needed
this
added
folly
oh
i
knowi
know
what
you
would
say
spare
it
me
my
safety
you
fear
for
me
ah
lady
landale
that
you
could
have
but
left
me
in
peace
he
had
waxed
hot
with
anger
from
his
first
wouldbe
calmness
as
he
spoke
this
dismal
life
of
close
but
inharmonious
proximity
started
upon
the
seas
and
continued
under
his
absent
friends
own
roof
had
tried
his
impetuous
temper
to
the
utmost
upon
the
morrow
of
their
return
he
had
indeed
exercised
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
lady
landale
to
proceed
to
the
priory
but
impelled
by
her
frantic
dread
of
the
separation
and
entrenching
herself
behind
the
argument
that
her
mysterious
reappearance
would
awaken
suspicion
where
people
would
otherwise
believe
the
peregrine
still
in
foreign
parts
she
had
declared
her
irrevocable
determination
not
to
quit
the
island
until
she
knew
him
to
be
safe
and
he
had
remained
actuated
by
the
dual
desire
first
to
exonerate
himself
personally
in
her
husbands
eyes
from
any
possible
suspicion
of
complicity
in
mollys
flightthe
bare
thought
of
which
had
become
a
horrible
torment
to
himthen
to
encompass
through
that
good
friends
means
an
interview
and
full
explanation
with
madeleine
which
not
only
the
most
ordinary
precaution
for
his
life
but
likewise
every
instinct
of
pride
forbade
him
now
to
seek
himself
thus
began
a
state
of
affairs
which
as
the
days
succeeded
each
other
without
news
of
sir
adrian
became
every
moment
more
intolerable
to
his
loyalty
the
inaction
the
solitary
hours
of
reflection
the
maddening
feeling
of
unavailing
proximity
to
his
hearts
dearest
of
impotency
against
the
involving
meshes
of
the
present
false
and
hateful
position
all
this
had
brought
into
the
young
mans
soul
a
fever
of
anger
which
as
fevers
will
consumed
him
the
more
fiercely
because
of
his
vigour
and
strength
it
was
with
undisguised
hatred
and
with
scorn
immeasurable
that
he
now
surveyed
the
woman
who
had
degraded
him
in
his
own
eyes
at
another
time
molly
might
have
yielded
before
his
resentment
but
at
this
hour
her
whole
being
was
encompassed
by
a
single
thought
it
is
for
youfor
you
she
repeated
with
ashen
lips
you
must
go
before
it
is
too
late
and
is
it
not
too
late
stormed
he
too
late
indeed
do
i
see
my
treachery
to
adrian
my
more
than
brother
upon
my
ship
i
could
not
avoid
your
company
but
hereoh
i
should
have
thought
of
him
and
not
of
myself
and
done
as
my
honour
bade
me
you
are
right
since
you
would
not
go
i
should
have
done
so
it
was
weak
it
was
mad
worse
worsedishonourable
but
she
had
no
ears
for
his
reproaches
no
power
to
feel
the
wounds
he
dealt
her
womans
heart
with
such
relentless
hand
then
you
will
go
she
cried
tell
ren
the
signal
he
started
and
looked
at
her
with
a
different
expression
have
you
heard
anything
has
anything
happened
he
asked
recovering
selfrestraint
at
the
thought
of
danger
not
yet
she
replied
not
yet
but
it
is
coming
her
look
and
voice
were
so
charged
with
tragic
force
that
for
the
moment
he
was
impressed
and
brave
man
though
he
was
felt
a
little
cold
thrill
run
down
his
spine
she
continued
in
accents
of
the
most
piercing
misery
and
it
will
have
been
through
meit
will
have
been
through
me
oh
in
mercy
let
me
make
the
signal
say
you
will
go
tonight
i
will
go
there
followed
a
little
pause
of
breathless
silence
between
them
then
as
without
speaking
he
would
have
turned
away
a
loud
peremptory
knock
resounded
upon
the
door
of
the
keep
and
echoed
and
reechoed
with
lugubrious
reverberation
through
the
old
stone
passages
around
them
at
first
terrorstricken
her
tongue
clave
to
her
palate
her
feet
were
rooted
to
the
ground
then
with
a
scream
she
flung
herself
upon
him
and
would
have
dragged
him
towards
the
door
they
have
comehidehide
he
threw
up
his
head
to
listen
while
he
strove
to
disengage
himself
the
blood
had
leaped
to
his
cheek
and
fire
to
his
eye
and
if
it
be
adrian
he
cried
another
knock
thundered
through
the
still
air
it
is
but
one
man
cried
ren
from
his
tower
down
the
stairs
you
may
open
moggie
nono
screamed
molly
beside
herself
and
tighter
clasped
her
arms
round
captain
jacks
neck
adrian
it
is
adrian
said
he
hush
madam
let
me
go
would
you
make
the
breach
between
me
and
my
friend
irreparable
both
his
hands
were
on
her
wrists
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
disengage
himself
from
her
frenzied
grip
the
door
was
flung
open
and
rupert
landale
stood
in
the
opening
and
looked
in
upon
them
damnation
muttered
jack
between
his
teeth
and
flung
her
from
him
stamping
his
foot
rupert
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
from
the
woman
who
haggard
and
dishevelled
now
turned
like
a
fury
upon
him
to
the
sailors
fierce
erect
figure
then
he
closed
the
door
with
an
air
of
grave
deliberation
what
do
you
want
demanded
mollyyou
have
come
here
for
no
good
purpose
what
do
you
want
as
she
spoke
she
strove
to
place
herself
between
the
two
men
i
came
my
dear
sisterinlaw
said
rupert
in
his
coldest
most
incisive
voice
to
learn
why
since
you
have
come
back
from
your
little
trip
you
choose
to
remain
in
the
ruins
rather
than
return
to
your
own
house
and
family
the
reason
is
clear
to
see
now
my
poor
brother
the
revulsion
of
disappointment
had
added
to
the
wrath
which
the
very
sight
of
rupert
landale
aroused

this
insinuation
was
the
culminating
injury
he
took
a
step
forward
have
a
care
sir
he
exclaimed
how
you
outrage
in
my
presence
the
wife
of
my
best
friend
have
a
carei
am
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
leave
you
as
when
last
we
met
mr
landale
raised
his
eyebrows
and
again
sent
a
look
from
molly
back
to
the
sailor
the
insolence
of
which
lashed
beyond
all
control
the
devils
in
the
sailors
soul
we
have
an
account
to
settle
it
seems
to
me
mr
landale
said
he
taking
another
step
forward
and
slightly
stooping
his
head
to
look
the
other
in
the
eye
crimson
fury
was
in
his
own
i
doubt
much
whether
it
was
quite
wise
of
you
assuming
that
you
expected
to
find
me
here
to
have
come
without
that
pistolling
retinue
with
which
you
provided
yourself
last
time
rupert
smiled
and
crossed
his
arms
cowardice
was
no
part
of
his
character
he
had
come
in
advance
of
his
bloodhounds
in
part
to
assure
himself
of
the
correctness
of
his
surmises
but
also
to
feast
upon
the
discomfiture
of
this
man
and
this
woman
whom
he
hated
to
have
found
them
together
and
thus
had
been
an
unforeseen
and
delicious
addition
to
his
dish
of
vengeance
and
he
would
linger
over
it
while
he
could
well
captain
smith
and
about
this
account
lady
landale
i
beg
of
you
be
silent
you
have
brought
sufficient
disgrace
upon
our
name
as
it
is
nay
sir
raising
his
voice
it
is
useless
to
shake
your
head
at
me
in
this
furious
style
nothing
can
alter
facts
i
saw
who
has
an
account
to
demand
thenyou
whose
life
is
already
forfeit
for
an
accumulation
of
crimes
you
screened
by
a
conspiracy
of
bribed
servants
and

your
best
friends
wife
as
you
dare
call
your
paramour
or
i
in
my
brothers
absence
the
natural
guardian
of
his
family
of
his
honour
but
i
am
too
late
one
sister
i
saved
from
the
ignominy
you
would
have
brought
upon
her
the
other
i
could
not
save
with
a
roar
jack
smith
would
have
sprung
at
the
speaker
but
once
more
his
friends
wife
rushed
between
let
him
speak
she
cried
what
matter
what
he
says
but
youremember
your
promise
i
will
make
the
signal
the
signal
the
mask
of
ruperts
face
sternly
and
sadly
rebuking
was
not
proof
against
the
exquisite
aptness
of
this
proposal
his
men
outside
were
waiting
for
the
signal
surrounding
the
island
from
land
and
seaward
for
the
prey
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
escape
them
again
but
how
to
make
it
without
creating
suspicion
had
not
yet
suggested
itself
to
his
fertile
brain
now
while
he
held
her
lover
in
play
molly
would
herself
deliver
him
to
justice
excellent
excellent
truly
life
held
some
delightful
jokes
for
the
man
of
humour
the
light
of
triumph
came
and
went
upon
his
countenance
like
a
flash
but
when
the
life
hangs
upon
the
decision
of
a
moment
the
wits
become
abnormally
sharp
jack
smith
saw
it
halted
upon
his
second
headlong
onslaught
and
turned
roundtoo
late
molly
was
gone
he
brought
his
gaze
back
upon
his
enemy
and
saw
he
had
been
trapped
their
gleams
met
like
duelling
blades
divining
each
others
purpose
with
the
rapidity
of
thrust
answering
thrust
both
made
a
leap
for
the
door
but
rupert
was
nearest
he
first
had
his
hand
on
the
key
and
turned
it
and
with
newlyborn
genius
of
fight
suddenly
begotten
of
his
hatred
quickly
stooped
eluded
the
advancing
grasp
was
free
for
one
second
and
sent
the
key
crashing
through
the
window
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
baffled
by
the
astounding
swiftness
of
the
act
the
sailor
wheeling
round
had
already
raised
his
fist
to
crush
his
feebler
foe
when
in
the
midst
of
his
fury
a
glimmer
of
the
allimportance
of
every
second
of
time
stayed
his
hand
he
threw
himself
upon
the
heavy
ladder
that
rested
against
sir
adrians
rows
of
books
and
clasping
it
by
the
middle
swung
it
above
his
head
the
battering
blow
would
no
doubt
have
burst
panel
lock
and
hinges
the
next
instant
but
again
rupert
forestalled
him
and
charged
him
before
the
door
could
be
reached
overbalanced
by
the
weight
he
held
aloft
captain
jack
was
hurled
down
headlong
beneath
the
ladder
and
lay
for
a
moment
stunned
by
the
violence
of
the
fall
when
the
clouds
cleared
away
it
was
to
let
him
see
ruperts
face
bending
over
him
his
pale
lips
wreathed
into
a
smile
of
malignant
exultation
caught
said
mr
landale
slowly
pausing
over
each
word
as
though
to
prolong
the
savour
of
it
in
his
mouth
caught
this
time
and
it
is
your
mistresss
hand
that
puts
the
noose
round
your
neck
that
is
what
i
call
poetical
justice
the
prostrate
man
collecting
his
scattered
wits
and
his
vast
strength
made
a
violent
effort
to
spring
to
his
feet
but
ruperts
whole
weight
was
upon
him
his
long
thin
fingers
were
gripping
him
by
each
shoulder
his
face
grinned
at
him
close
detested
infuriating
the
grasp
that
held
him
seemed
to
belong
to
no
flesh
and
blood
it
was
as
the
grasp
of
skeleton
hands
the
grinning
face
became
like
a
deaths
head
i
shall
come
to
your
hanging
captain
jack
smith
or
rather
mr
hubert
cochrane
of
the
shaws
these
were
the
last
words
of
rupert
landale
a
red
whirl
passed
through
the
sailors
brain
his
hands
fell
like
lashes
round
the
others
neck
and
drew
it
down
if
hubert
cochrane
dies
so
does
rupert
landale
that
throat
shall
never
give
sound
to
that
name
again
over
and
over
they
roll
like
savage
beasts
but
yet
in
deathly
silence
for
the
pressure
of
the
fingers
on
his
gullet
fingers
that
seem
to
gain
fresh
strength
every
moment
and
pierce
into
his
very
flesh
will
not
allow
even
a
sigh
to
pass
ruperts
lips
and
jack
can
spare
no
atom
of
his
energy
from
the
fury
of
fight
not
one
to
spare
even
for
the
hearing
of
the
frantic
knocks
at
the
door
the
calls
the
hammering
at
the
lock
the
desperate
efforts
without
to
prise
it
open
but
if
rupert
landale
must
die
so
shall
hubert
cochrane
and
by
the
hangmans
hand
treble
doomed
by
this
the
same
thought
fills
both
these
mens
heads
the
devil
of
murder
has
possession
of
both
their
souls
but
true
to
himself
to
the
last
it
is
with
rupert
a
calculating
devil
the
officers
must
soon
be
here
he
will
hold
the
scoundrel
yet
with
the
grasp
of
death
and
his
enemy
shall
be
found
redhandedredhanded
his
hatred
his
determination
of
vengeance
the
very
agony
of
the
unequal
struggle
for
life
gave
him
a
power
that
is
almost
a
match
for
the
young
athlete
in
his
frenzy
the
dying
efforts
of
his
victim
tax
jacks
strength
more
than
the
living
fight
but
his
hands
are
still
locked
in
their
fatal
clutch
when
at
last
with
one
fearful
and
spasmodic
jerk
rupert
landale
falls
motionless
then
exhaustion
enwraps
the
conqueror
also
like
a
mantle
he
too
lies
motionless
with
his
cheek
on
the
floor
face
to
face
with
the
corpse
dimly
conscious
of
the
voluptuousness
of
victory
but
the
dead
grasp
still
holds
him
by
the
wrists
and
it
grows
cold
now
and
rigid
upon
them
it
is
as
if
they
were
fettered
with
iron





lady
landales
dread
of
her
once
despised
kinsman
now
that
she
knew
what
a
powerful
weapon
he
held
in
his
hands
this
night
was
almost
fantastic
as
she
darted
from
the
room
she
fell
against
ren
who
with
a
white
face
and
bent
ear
stood
at
the
door
eavesdropping
ready
to
rush
to
the
help
of
sir
adrians
friend
upon
the
first
hint
of
necessity
but
he
had
heard
more
than
he
bargained
for
the
scared
wellnigh
agonised
look
of
inquiry
with
which
he
turned
to
his
mistress
was
lost
upon
her
in
her
whirlwind
exit
she
seized
upon
him
and
dragged
him
with
her
to
the
ladder
that
led
to
the
tower
quick
ren
the
signal
and
with
the
birdlike
swiftness
of
a
dream
flight
she
was
up
the
steps
before
him
panting
in
her
wake
ran
the
sturdy
fellow
his
brain
seething
in
a
chaos
of
conflicting
thought
mr
the
captain
must
be
helped
must
be
saved
this
one
thing
was
clear
at
any
rate
his
honour
would
wish
it
sono
matter
what
had
happened
yes
he
would
obey
my
lady
and
make
the
signal
but
what
if
mr
landale
were
right
not
indeed
in
his
accusation
of
mr
the
captain
ren
knew
ren
had
seen
enough
to
trust
him
he
was
no
false
friend
but
as
regarded
my
lady
alas
my
lady
had
indeed
been
strange
in
her
manner
these
days
and
even
moggie
as
he
minded
him
now
even
moggie
had
noticed
had
hinted
and
he
had
not
understood
the
mans
fingers
fumbled
over
the
catch
of
the
great
lantern
he
shook
as
if
he
had
the
palsy
goodness
divine
if
his
master
were
to
come
home
to
this
impatiently
lady
landale
pushed
him
upon
one
side
what
ailed
the
fellow
when
every
second
was
crucial
life
or
death
bringing
medusalike
for
one
second
her
face
hung
whiteillumined
set
into
terrible
fixity
above
the
great
flame
the
next
instant
all
was
blackness
to
their
dazzled
eyes
the
light
of
scarthey
was
out
she
groped
for
ren
her
hot
fingers
burnt
upon
his
cold
rough
hand
for
a
second
i
will
go
down
to
the
sands
she
said
whispering
as
if
she
feared
even
here
the
keenness
of
ruperts
ear
and
youhurry
to
him
stop
with
him
defend
him
your
masters
friend
she
flitted
from
him
like
a
shadow
the
ladder
creaked
faintly
beneath
her
light
footfall
and
then
louder
beneath
his
weighty
tread
his
masters
friend
ay
he
would
stand
by
him
for
his
masters
sake
and
for
his
own
sake
toothe
good
gentlemanand
they
would
get
him
safe
out
of
the
way
before
his
honours
return





out
upon
the
beach
ran
molly
it
was
a
mild
still
night
through
veils
of
light
mist
the
moon
shone
with
a
tranquil
bridelike
grace
upon
the
heaving
palpitating
waters
and
the
mystery
of
the
silent
land
a
very
night
for
lovers
it
seemed
for
sweet
meetings
and
sweeter
partings
a
night
that
mocked
with
its
great
passionless
calm
at
the
wild
anguish
of
this
womans
impatience
yet
a
night
upon
which
sound
travelled
far
she
bent
her
earwas
there
nothing
to
hear
yet
nothing
but
the
lap
of
the
restless
waters
were
those
men
false
she
rushed
to
and
fro
from
one
point
to
another
along
the
sands
in
a
delirium
of
impotent
desire
oh
hurry
hurry
hurry
and
as
she
turned
again
there
upon
the
waters
out
in
the
offing
glimmered
a
light
curtseying
with
the
swell
of
the
waves
the
sails
of
a
ship
caught
the
moonbeams
she
could
see
the
vessel
plainly
and
that
it
was
bearing
full
for
the
island
alas
this
might
scarcely
be
the
little
shearman
boat
manned
by
two
fishermen
only
even
she
unversed
in
sea
knowledge
could
tell
that
it
was
as
large
as
the
peregrine
itselfcertainly
as
large
as
the
cutter
the
cutter
she
caught
her
breath
and
clapped
her
hands
to
her
lips
to
choke
down
the
wild
scream
of
fear
that
rose
to
them
at
the
same
instant
a
dull
thud
of
oars
a
subdued
murmur
of
a
deep
voice
rose
from
the
other
side
of
the
island
they
were
coming
coming
from
the
landward
these
rescuers
of
her
beloved
and
yonder
with
swelling
canvas
came
the
hell
ship
from
out
the
open
sea
sent
by
ruperts
infernal
malice
and
cleverness
to
make
their
help
of
no
avail
to
seize
him
in
the
very
act
of
flight
she
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
with
all
her
strength
called
upon
the
newcomers
to
speed
herehere
for

voice
seemed
to
her
in
the
midst
of
the
endless
space
weak
as
a
childs
but
it
was
heard
coming
answered
a
gruff
shout
from
afar
and
the

came
closer
and
fell
with
swifter

lady
landale
came
flying
round
the
ruins
a
couple
of
boats
crashed
in
upon
the
shingle
and
the
whole
night
seemed
suddenly
to
become
alive
with
dark
figuresmen
in
uniform
with
gleams
upon
them
of
brass
badges
and
shining
belts
and
in
their
hands
the
gleam
of
arms
for
the
moment
she
could
not
move
it
was
as
if
her
knees
were
giving
way
and
she
must
fall
none
of
them
saw
her
in
the
shadow
but
as
they
passed
she
heard
them
talking
to
each
other
about
the
signal
the
signal
which
they
had
been
told
to

the

in

even
as
she
came
up
a
tall
figure
jumped
out
upon
the
sand
and
crunched
towards
her
with
great
strides
she
made
a
leap

his
arms
were
stretched
out
to

but
he
saw

from
him
and
wring

my

what

fastened
on

with
a
sudden
fierceness
the
spring
of
a

cat

she
said
drawing
him
towards
the
peel
if
you
would

not
a

he
hesitated
a
moment
still
she
tugged
at
him
like
one
demented
panting
her
abjurations
at
him
though
her
voice
was
failing
her
then
without
a
word
he
fell
to
running
with
her
towards
the
keep
supporting
her
as
they
went
the
great
door
had
swung
back
on
its
hinges
and
the
men
were
pressing
in
a
dark
body
into
the
dimlit
recesses
when
sir
adrian
and
his
wife
reached
the
entrance
the
sight
of
the
uniforms
only
confirmed
the
homecomer
in
his
own
forebodings
anent
the
first
act
of
the
drama
that
was
being
enacted
upon
his
peaceful
island
he
needed
no
further
pushing
from
the
frantic
woman
at
his
side
lost
in
bringing
her
back
perhaps
his
only
friend
lost
by
his
loyalty
and
his
true
friendship
they
dashed
up
the
stone
stairs
just
as
the
locked
door
of
the
livingroom
burst
with
a
crash
under
the
efforts
of
many
stalwart
shoulders
they
saw
the
men
crush
forwards
and
fall
back
and
herd
on
again
with
a
hoarse
murmur
that
leaped
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
ren
came
running
out
from
the
throng
with
the
face
of
one
that
has
seen
death
and
he
caught
his
mistress
by
the
arm
and
held
her
by
main
force
against
the
wall
he
showed
no
surprise
at
the
sight
of
his
masterthere

moments
in

that
are

cried
wildly
she
must
not
see
she
fought
like
a
tigress
against
the
faithful
arms
but
still
they
held
her
and
sir
adrian
went
in
alone
a
couple
of
men
were
dragging
captain
jack
to
his
feet
forcing
his
hands
from
the
dead
mans
throat
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
grown
as
rigid
and
paralysed
in
their
clasp
like
the
corpse
hands
that
had
now
likewise
to
be
wrenched
from
their
clutch
of
him
he
glanced
around
as
though
dazed
then
down
at
the
disfigured
purple
face
of
his
dead
enemy
smiled
and
held
out
his
hands
stiffly
for
the
gyves
that
were
snapped
upon
them
and
then
one
of
the
fellows
with
some
instinctive
feeling
of
decency
flung
a
coat
over
the
slain
man
and
captain
jack
threw
up
his
head
and
met
adrians
horrorstricken
sorrowful
eyes
at
the
unexpected
sight
he
grew

some
of
the
men
were
speaking
to
sir
adrian
but
drew
back
respectfully
before
the
spectacle
of
his
wordless
agony
but
as
molly
with
a
shriek
would
have
flung
herself
after
the

her
husband
awoke
to
action
and
pushing
ren
aside
caught
her
round
the
waist
with
an
unyielding
grip
his
eyes
sought
her
face
and
as
the
light
fell
on
it
he
understood

she
had
been
brought
back
to
him

her

with

with
a

repulsion

with

and
then

round

sir

weary
brow

he
paused
and
looked
at

she
asked

shot
the
sombre
fire
of
her

at

you

that
i

she
said
with
a
terrible
composure
a
sudden
whiteness
spread
round
sir
adrians
lips
poor
child
he
said
again
beneath
his
breath
yes
i
love
him
i
always
wanted
to
see
him
i
was
sick
and
tired
of
life
at
pulwick
and
that
was
why
i
went
on
board
his
ship
i
went
deliberately
because
i
could
not
bear
the
dulness
of
it
all
he
mistook
me
for
madeleine
in
the
darkhe
kissed
me
afterwards
i
told
him
that
i
loved
him
i
begged
him
to
take
me
away
with
him
for
ever
i
love
him
still
i
would
go
with
him
stillit
is
as
well
that
you
should
know
nothing
can
alter
it
now
but
he
did
not
want
me
he
loves
madeleine
the
words
fell
from
her
lips
with
a
steady
cruel
deliberateness
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
him
as
she
spoke
unpityingly
uncaring
what
anguish
she
inflicted
nay
it
seemed
from
some
strange
perversity
glad
to
make
him
suffer
but
hard
upon
a
man
as
it
must
be
to
hear
such
a
confession
from
his
wifes
lips
doubly
hard
to
such
a
one
as
adrian
whose
heart
bled
for
her
pain
as
well
as
for
his
own
he
held
himself
without
departing
for
a
second
from
his
wonted
quiet
dignity
only
in
his
earnest
gaze
upon
her
there
was
perhaps
if
possible
an
added
tenderness
but
she
to
see
him
so
unmoved
was
moved
herself
to
a
sudden
scorn
what
manner
of
man
was
this
that
not
love
nor
jealousy
nor
anger
had
power
to
stir
and
now
what
will
you
do
with
me
she
asked
him
again
with
superb
contempt
on
eye
and
lip
for
a
guilty
wife
i
am
to
you
as
far
as
the

could
make
me
and
i
have
no

upon
you
any
more
no

repeated
with
a
wonder
of

in
his
voice

some

you
may

it
my

my

you
will
always
have

you

there
any
sin
of

a

condemn

mine

you
to

my
melancholy
age
with
your
bright
youth
he
fell
into
the
chair
opposite
to
her
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
as
for
a
minutes
space
his
selfcontrol
wavered
she
watched
him
wearily
her
heat
of
temper
had
fallen
from
her
very
quickly
she
broke
into
a
moan
oh

he
said
his
heart
was
yearning
to
her
he
would
have
gathered
her
to
his
arms
as
a
father
his
erring
child
but
he
refrained
from
even
touching
her

youwhat
would
you
do
it
shall

he
paused
hesitated
and
was
about
to
turn
away
when
suddenly
she
caught
his
hand
and
kissed
it
he
knew
she
would
as
readily
have
kissed
rens
hand
for
a
like
promise
that
her
gratitude
was
a
pitiable
thing
for
him
her
husband
to
bear
and
yet
all
the
way
on
his
sad
and
solitary
journey
to
pulwick
the
touch
of
her
lips
went
with
him
bringing
a
strange
sweetness
to
his
heart





there
was
a
vast
deal
of
wonder
in
the
county
generally
and
among
the
old
friends
of
his
fathers
house
in
particular
when
it
became
known
that
sir

was
doing
all
he
could
to
avert
his
probable
doom
in

people
wagged
wise
and
virtuous
heads
and
breathed
scandalous
hints
of
her
power
upon
her
infatuated
husband
and
then
they
would
tap
their
foreheads
significantly
indeed
it
needed
all
the
master
of
pulwicks
widespread
reputation
for
mental
unsoundness
to
enable
him
to
carry
through
such
proceedings
without
rousing
more
violent
feelings
as
it
was
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
his
interference
had
any
other
effect
than
that
of
helping
to
inflame
the
public
mind
against
the
prisoner
the
jurys
verdict
was
a
foregone
conclusion
and
though
the
learned
lawyer
duly
prepared
a
very
fine
speech
and
pocketed
some
monstrous
fees
with
a
great
deal
of
complaisance
he
was
honest
enough
not
to
hold
out
the
smallest
hope
of
being
able
to
save
his
client
the
conviction
was
too
clear
the
crimes
the
prisoner
had
committed
were
of
too
horrible
and
bloody
a
character
threatening
the
very
foundations
of
society
to
admit
of
a
merciful
view
of
the
case
as
the
trial
drew
near
sir
adrians
despondency
increased
each
day
seemed
to
bring
a
heavier
furrow
to
his
brow
an
added
weight
to
his
lagging
steps
he
avoided
as
much
as
possible
all
meetings
with
his
wife
who
on
the
contrary
recovered
stronger
courage
with
the
flight
of
time
but
whose
feverish
interest
in
his
exertions
was
now
transferred
to
some
secret
plans
that
she
was
for
ever
discussing
with
ren
the
prisoner
himself
showed
great
calmness
they
will
sentence
me
of
course
he
said
quietly
to
adrian
but
whether
they
will
hang
me
is
another
question
i
dont
think
that
my
hour
has
come
yet
or
that
the
cord
is
twisted
which
will
hang
jack
smith
in
other
moods
he
would
ridicule
sir
adrians
labours
in
his
cause
with
the
most
gentle
note
of
affectionate
mockery
but
from
the
desire
doubtless
to
save
one
so
disinterested
and
unworldly
from
any
accusation
of
complicity
he
was
silent
upon
the
schemes
on
which
he
pinned
his
hopes
of
escape
the
first
meeting
of
the
friends
after
the
scene
at
scarthey
had
been
of
course
painful
to
both
when
he
entered
the
cell
adrian
had
stretched
out
his
hand
in
silence
but
captain
jack
held
his
own
pressed
to
his
side
it
is
like
you
to
come
he
said
gloomily
but
you
cannot
shake
the
hand
that
stifled
your
brothers
life
out
of
him
and
i
should
do
it
again
adrian
mark
you
i
am
not
repentant
give
me
your
hand
jack
said
adrian
steadfastly
i
am
not
of
those
who
shift
responsibility
from
the
dead
to
the
living
you
were
grievously
treated
oh
give
me
your
hand
friend
can
i
think
of
anything
now
but
your
peril
and
your
truth
to
me
for
an
instant
still
the
younger
man
hesitated
and
inquiringly
raised
his
eyes
laden
with
anxious
trouble
to
the
elder
mans
face
my
wife
has
told
me
all
said
sir
adrian
turning
his
head
to
hide
his
twitching
lip
and
then
jack
smiths
hand
leaped
out
to
meet
his
friends
upon
an
impulse
of
warm
sympathy
and
the
two
faced
each
other
looking
the
words
they
could
not
utter





the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
fifteen
which
delivered
england
at
last
from
the
strain
of
outlandish
conflict
saw
a
revival
of
official
activity
concerning
matters
of
more
homely
interest
the
powers
that
were
awoke
to
the
necessity
among
other
things
of
putting
a
stop
by
the
most
stringent
means
to
the
constant
and
extensive
leakage
in
the
national
revenue
proceeding
from
the
organisation
of
free
traders
or
smugglers
after
twenty
years
of
almost
complete
supineness
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
the
first
efforts
made
towards
a
systematic
preventive
coast
service
composed
of
customs
excise
and
naval
officials
in
proportion
varied
according
to
the
localities
remained
singularly
futile
and
to
the
notorious
inability
of
these
latter
to
cope
with
the
experience
and
the
devilish
daring
of
the
old
established
free
traders
was
due
no
doubt
to
the
ferocity
of
the
inquisitional
laws
presently
levelled
against
smuggling
and
smugglerslaws
which
ruthlessly
trenched
upon
almost
every
element
of
the
british
subjects
vaunted
personal
freedom
and
which
added
for
the
time
several
new
hanging
cases
to
the
sixty
odd
already
in
existence
that
part
of
the
indictment
against
captain
jack
smith
and
the
other
criminals
still
at
large
which
dealt
with
their
offences
against
the
smuggling
act
would
in
later
times
have
broken
down
infallibly
from
want
of
proper
evidence
not
a
tittle
of
information
was
forthcoming
which
could
support
examination
but
a
judge
of
assizes
and
a
jury
in
1815
were
not
to
be
baulked
of
the
necessary
victim
by
mere
circumstantiality
when
certain
offences
against
society
and
against
his
majesty
had
to
be
avenged
and
the
dispensers
of
justice
were
less
concerned
with
strict
evidence
than
with
the
desirability
of
making
examples
strong
presumption
was
all
that
was
required
to
them
to
hang
their
man
and
indeed
the
hanging
of
captain
jack
upon
the
other
and
more
serious
counts
than
that
of
unlawful
occupation
was
as
has
been
said
a
foregone
conclusion
the
triple
charge
of
murder
being
but
too
fully
corroborated
every
specious
argument
that
could
be
mooted
was
of
course
put
forward
by
counsel
for
the
defence
to
show
that
the
death
of
the
preventive
men
and
of
mr
landale
on
scarthey
island
and
the
sinking
of
the
revenue
cutter
must
be
looked
upon
on
the
one
hand
as
simple
manslaughter
in
selfdefence
and
as
the
result
of
accidental
collision
on
the
other
but
as
every
one
anticipated
the
charge
of
the
judge
and
the
finding
of
the
jury
demanded
strenuously
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
besides
this
the
judge
deemed
it
advisable
to
introduce
into
the
sentence
one
of
those
already
obsolete
penalties
of
posthumous
degradation
devised
in
coarser
ages

the

that
his

viewed
with

part

was
the
realisation
that

broken
those
custom

sir

an
aching
heart
and
a
wider
horror
than
ever
of
the
cruel
world
of

of
the
injustices
to

as
the

along

gallant
heart
breaking
in
the
confinement
of
the
prison
yonder
would
have
throbbed
its
last
and
he
longed
with
a
desire
futile
but
none
the
less
intense
that
according
to
that
doctrine
of
vicarious
atonement
preached
to
humanity
by
the
greatest
of
all
examples
he
could
lay
down
his

weary

life
for
his

having
breakfasted
at

maturity

old
demoiselle
i
knew
it
was
because
my
lady
had
taken
it
to
heart
about
the
signal
that
she
madethinking
to
save
himand
which
only
brought
the
gabelous
on
him
that
his
honours
infernal
brother
god
forgive
me
and
have
mercy
on
his
soul
had
set
to
watch
and
my
lady
liked
to
see
me
coming
and
going
for
she
sent
me
every
day
to
the
prison
she
did
not
once
go
herself
sir
adrian
drew
a
long
breath
with
the
most
delicate
intuition
of
his
masters
thoughts
ren
avoided
even
a
glance
at
him
while
he
continued
in
as
natural
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
but
the
day
after
the
old
miss
came
she
my
lady
told
me
to
find
out
if
he
would
see
her
he
said
no
but
that
the
only
kindness
any
one
could
do
him
now
would
be
to
bring
him
mademoiselle
madeleine
and
let
him
speak
to
her
once
more
and
my
lady
when
she
heard
this
she
started
off
that
day
with
the
old
one
to
fetch
mademoiselle
herself
at
pulwick
and
she
left
me
behind
your
honour
for
i
had
a
little
plan
there
ren
faltered
and
a
crestfallen
look
crept
upon
his
face
sir
adrian
remembered
how
before
his
departure
for
london
his
servant
had
cheerily
assured
him
that
mr
the
captain
would
be
safe
out
of
the
country
long
before
he
returned
faith
of
him
ren
who
had
already
been
in
two
prisons
and
knew
their
ways
and
how
to
contrive
an
escape
as
his
honour
well
knew
a
sad
smile
parted
his
lips
and
so
you
failed
renny
he
said
ah
your
honour
those
satanic
english
turnkeys
with
a
frenchman
the
job
had
been
done
but
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
be
in
prison
in
england
his
honour
can
vouch
i
have
some
brains
i
had
made
plansa
hundred
plans
but
there
was
ever
something
that
did
not
work
the
captain
he
too
was
eager
as
your
honour
can
imagine
my
faith
we
thought
and
we
thought
and
we
schemed
and
contrived
and
in
the
end
there
was
only
one
thing
to
complete
our
plotto
bribe
the
jailer
would
your
honour
believeit
was
only
that
one
little
difficulty
my
lady
had
given
me
a
hundred
guineas
i
had
enough
money
your
honour
sees
but
the
mani
had
smoked
with
him
drunk
with
him
ay
and
made
him
drunk
too
and
i
thought
all
was
going
well
but
when
i
hinted
to
him
what
we
wantedah
he
was
a
brutei
tell
you
i
had
hard
work
to
escape
the
prison
myself
and
only
for
my
leaving
him
with
some
of
the
money
i
should
now
be
pinched
there
too
i
hardly
dare
show
my
face
in
the
place
any
more
and
my
poor
lady
builds
on
the
hope
and
mr
the
captaini
had
to
tell
him
he
took
it
like
an
angel
ah
the
poor
gentleman
he
looked
at
me
so
brave
and
kind
i
am
as
grateful
my
poor
friend
as
if
you
had
done
it
said
he
and
perhaps
it
is
all
for
the
best
all
for
the
bestah
your
honour
ren
fairly
broke
down
here
and
wept
on
his
sleeve
but
sir
adrians
eyes
circled
and
worn
with
watching
and
thought
shone
dry
with
a
far
deeper
grief
as
a
few
moments
later
he
passed
along
the
street
towards
the
walls
of
the
castle





there
was
in
those
days
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
admission
to
a
condemned
prisoner
and
in
the
rear
of
the
redheaded
goodtempered
looking
jailerthe
same
he
surmised
whose
sternness
in
duty
had
baffled
the
bretons
simple
wileshe
stepped
out
of
the
sweet
morning
sunshine
into
the
long
stone
passages
the
first
tainted
breath
of
the
prison
brought
a
chill
to
his
blood
and
oppression
to
his
lungs
and
the
gloom
of
the
place
enveloped
him
like
a
pall
with
a
rattle
of
keys
a
door
dismally
creaking
on
its
hinges
was
swung
back
at
last
and
the
visitor
was
ushered
into
the
narrow
cell
dark
for
all
its
whitewashed
walls
where
captain
jack
was
spending
his
last
hours
upon
earth
the
hinges
groaned
again
the
door
slammed
and
the
key
once
more
grated
in
the
lock
sir
adrian
was
alone
with
his
friend
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
the
contraction
of
the
elder
mans
heart
had
brought
a
giddiness
to
his
brain
a
dimness
of
his
eyes
through
which
he
was
ill
able
to
distinguish
anything
but
then
there
was
a
clank
of
fettersah
what
a
sound
to
connect
with
lucky
jack
smith
the
gayest
freest
and
most
buoyant
of
men
and
a
voice
cried
adrian
it
had
a
joyful
ring
wellnigh
the
old
hearty
tones
it
struck
adrian
to
the
soul
he
could
have
borne
he
thought
to
find
his
friend
a
broken
man
changed
out
of
all
recognition
crushed
by
his
misfortunes
but
to
find
him
the
same
a
little
pale
indeed
and
thinner
with
a
steady
earnestness
in
the
seablue
eyes
instead
of
the
old
dancinglight
but
still
gallant
and
undaunted
still
radiating
vigorous
life
and
breezy
energy
by
his
very
presence
this
was
a
cruelty
of
fate
which
seemed
unendurable
i
declare
the
prisoner
had
continued
i
declare
i
thought
you
were
only
the
incorruptible
jailer
taking
his
morning
survey
they
are
desperately
careful
of
me
adrian
and
watch
me
with
maternal
solicitude
lest
i
should
strangle
myself
with
my
chains
these
pretty
bracelets
which
i
have
had
to
wear
ever
since
poor
renny
was
found
out
or
swallow

pillowdash

pretty

why
adrian
old
friend
there
was
a
sudden
change
of
tone
to
the
warmest
concern
for
sir
adrian
had
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
jack
as
nimbly
as
his
fetters
would
allow
him
sprung
to
support
him
and
conduct
him
to
the
bed
a
shaft
of
light
struck
through
the
tiny
barred
window
on
to
the
elder
mans
face
and
showed
it
against
the
surrounding
darkness
deathly
white
and
wet
with
anguish
i
have
done
all
i
could
hubert
he
murmured
in
an
extinguished
voice
but
to
no
avail
ay
man
i
guessed
as
much
but
never
fret
for
me
adrian
i
have
looked
death
too
often
in
the
face
to
play
the
poltroon
now
i
dont
say
its
the
end
i
should
have
chosen
for
myself
but
it
is
inevitable
and
there
is
nothing
as
you
know
my
friend
that
a
man
cannot
face
if
he
knows
it
must
be
faced
the
grasp
of
his
strong
warm
hands
all
manacled
as
they
were
upon
the
others
nerveless
clammy
fingers
sent
more
than
the
words
something
of
the
speakers
own
courage
to
his
friends
wrung
heart
and
yet
that
very
courage
was
an
added
torment
that
from
a
community
so
full
of
evil
feeble
harmful
wretches
this
noble
soul
no
matter
how
it
had
sinned
should
be
banished
at
the
bidding
of
justicewhat
mockery
of
right
was
this
the
world
was
out
of
joint
indeed
he
groaned
aloud
nay
ill
have
none
of
it
cried
jack
our
last
talk
adrian
must
not
be
spoiled
by
futile
regrets
yes
our
last
talk
it
is
to
be
forthe
prisoners
face
became
transfigured
with
a
tenderness
so
exquisite
that
adrian
stared
at
its
beauty
amazedi
have
begged
her
madeleine
to
come
and
see
me
once
more
i
think
she
can
be
here
today
at
latest
tomorrow
and
after
that
i
would
not
see
any
of
those
i
love
again
that
i
may
fit
myself
to
meet
my
god
he
spoke
with
the
utmost
simplicity
adrian
bowed
his
head
silently
then
averting
his
eyes
he
said
my
wife
has
gone
to
pulwick
to
fetch
her
captain
jack
crimsoned
that
is
kind
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
and
after
a
pause
pursued
i
hope
you
do
not
think
it
wrong
of
me
to
wish
to
see
her
but
you
may
trust
me
i
shall
distress
her
as
little
as
is
possible
in
the
circumstances
it
is
not
as
you
can
fancyhis
face
flushed
again
as
he
spoketo
indulge
in
a
pathetic
parting
scene
or
beg
from
her
sweet
lips
one
last
kissthat
would
be
too
grossly
selfish
and
however
this
poor
body
of
mine
so
soon
to
be
carrion
may
yearn
to
hold
her
once
more
closely
these
lips
so
soon
to
touch
death
shall
touch
hers
no
more
i
have
risen
so
far
above
this
earthliness
that
in
so
many
hours
i
am
to
shake
off
for
ever
that
i
can
trust
myself
to
meet
her
soul
to
soul
she
must
believe
me
now
and
i
would
tell
her
adrian
that
my
deceit
was
not
premeditated
and
that
the
man
she
once
honoured
with
her
love
is
not
the
base
wretch
she
deems
i
think
it
may
comfort
her
if
she
does
mourn
for
me
at
allshe
has
so
proud
a
spirit
my
princess
as
i
used
to
call
herit
may
comfort
her
to
know
that
i
was
not
all
unworthy
of
the
love
she
once
gave
me
of
the
tears
she
may
yet
give
to
its
memory
and
mine
sir
adrian
pressed
his
hand
but
again
could
not
speak
and
captain
jack
went
on
you
will
give
her
a
happy
home
will
you
not
till
she
has
one
of
her
own
you
and
your
old
dragon
of
an
aunt
whose
bark
is
so
much
worse
than
her
bite
will
watch
and
guard
her
ah
poor
old
lady
she
is
one
of
those
that
will
not
weep
for
jack
smith
eh
adrian
well
well
i
have
had
a
happy
life
barring
one
or
two
hard
raps
of
fate
and
when
only
i
have
seen
madeleine
once
more
ill
feel
all
taut
for
the
port
though
the
passage
there
be
a
rough
one
sir
adrian
turned
his
gaze
with
astonishment
upon
him
the
sailor
read
his
thoughts
dont
think
he
said
while
a
sudden
shadow
crossed
his
face
dont
think
that
i
dont
realise
my
position
that
i
have
not
had
to
fight
my
battle
in
the
beginning
i
had
hopes
never
in
the
success
of
your
mission
but
absurd
as
it
was
in
rennys
scheme
the
good
fellows
own
hopefulness
was
infectious
i
believe
and
when
that
fell
throughwell
then
man
i
just
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
what
was
to
be
it
was
a
battle
as
i
told
you
i
have
been
in
danger
of
death
many
a
time
upon
the
brave
old
st
nicholas
and
my
cormorantdeath
from
the
salt
sea
from
musket
ball
and
cannon
shot
fearful
deaths
of
mangling
and
hacking
but
death
on
the
gallows
the
shameful
death
of
the
criminal
to
be
hung
to
be
executedpah
ay
it
was
a
battletwo
nights
and
one
day
i
fought
it
and
i
tell
you
tis
a
hard
thing
to
bring
the
living
flesh
and
the
leaping
blood
to
submit
to
such
as
that
at
first
i
thought
indeed
it
could
not
be
borne
and
i
must
reckon
upon
your
or
rennys
friendship
for
a
secret
speed
i
should
have
had
the
pluck
to
starve
myself
if
need
be
only
i
am
so
damned
strong
and
healthy
i
feared
it
could
not
have
been
managed
in
the
time
at
any
rate
i
could
have
dashed
my
brains
out
against
the
wallbut
i
see
it
otherwise
now
the
prison
chaplain
a
good
man
adrian
has
made
me
realise
that
it
would
be
cowardly
that
i
should
accept
my
sentence
as
atonement
as
deservedi
have
deserved
to
die
it
had
been
sir
adrians
own
thought
but
he
broke
out
now
in
inarticulate
protest
it
seemed
too
gross
too
monstrous
yes
adrian
i
have
you
warned
me
good
friend
in
your
peaceful
roomah
how
long
ago
it
seems
now
that
night
when
all
that
could
make
life
beautiful
lay
to
my
hand
for
the
taking
oh
man
why
did
i
not
heed
you
you
warned
me
he
who
breaks
one
law
will
end
by
breaking
many
you
were
right
see
the
harm
i
wreakedthose
poor
fellows
who
were
but
doing
their
duty
bravely
whose
lives
i
sacrificed
without
remorse
your
brother
too
whose
soul
with
the
most
deliberate
vindictiveness
i
sent
before
its
maker
without
an
instants
preparation
a
guilty
soul
it
was
for
he
hounded
me
down
one
would
almost
think
for
the
sport
of
it
god
when
i
think
that
but
for
him
for
his
wanton
interferencebut
there
the
devils
are
loose
again
i
must
not
think
on
him
do
i
not
deserve
my
fate
if
the
bible
law
be
right
he
who
sheds
blood
his
blood
shall
be
shed
never
was
sentence
more
just
i
have
sinned
i
have
repented
i
am
now
ready
to
atone
i
believe
the
sacrifice
will
be
accepted
he
laid
his
hand
for
a
minute
upon
the
bible
on
the
table
with
a
significant
gesture
but
sir
adrian
the
philosopher
though
he
could
find
no
words
to
impeach
the
logic
of
his
friends
reasoning
and
was
all
astir
with
admiration
for
a
resignation
as
perfect
as
either
christian
or
stoic
could
desire
found
his
soul
rising
in
tumultuous
rebellion
against
the
hideous
decree
the
longing
that
had
beset
him
in
the
dawn
now
seized
upon
him
with
a
new
passion
and
the
cry
escaped
his
lips
almost
unwittingly
oh
if
i
could
die
for
you
no
no
said
jack
with
his
sweet
smile
your
life
is
too
valuable
too
precious
to
the
world
adrian
believe
me
you
can
still
do
much
good
with
it
and
i
know
you
will
be
happy
yet
it
was
the
only
allusion
he
had
made
to
his
friends
more
personal
sorrows
before
the
latter
had
time
to
reply
he
hastened
to
proceed
and
now
to
business
all
the
gold
entrusted
to
me
lies
at
scarthey
and
faith
i
believe
it
lies
as
weightily
on
my
mind
as
if
it
was
all
stored
there
instead
renny
knows
the
secret
hidingplace
will
you
engage
to
restore
it
to
its
owners
in
all
privacy
this
is
a
terribly
arduous
undertaking
adrian
and
it
is
asking
much
of
your
friendship
but
if
i
know
you
not
too
much
and
it
will
enable
my
poor
bones
to
lie
at
rest
or
rather
with
a
rueful
laugh
hang
at
rest
on
their
gibbet
for
you
know
i
am
to
be
set
up
as
a
warning
to
other
fools
like
a
rat
on
a
barn
door
i
have
by
the
kindness
of
the
chaplain
been
able
to
write
out
a
full
schedule
of
the
different
sums
and
to
whom
they
are
due
he
has
taken
charge
of
the
closed
packet
directed
to
you
and
will
give
it
to
you
intact
i
feel
sure
he
is
a
man
of
honour
and
i
trust
him
to
respect
the
confidence
i
have
placed
in
him
egad
the
poor
old
boys
will
be
right
glad
to
get
their
coin
back
in
safety
a
couple
of
them
have
been
up
here
already
to
interview
me
in
fear
and
trembling
they
were
hard
set
to
credit
me
when
i
assured
them
that
they
would
be
no
losers
in
the
end
after
allbarring
the
waiting
you
see
i
counted
upon
you
i
shall
never
rest
until
it
is
done
said
sir
adrian
simply
and
captain
jack
as
simply
answered
thank
you
among
the
treasure
there
is
also
10000
of
my
own
the
rest
of
my
laboriously
acquired
fortune
is
forfeit
to
the
crown
as
you
knowmuch
good
may
it
do
it
but
this
little
hoard
i
give
to
you
you
do
not
want
it
of
course
and
therefore
it
is
only
to
be
yours
that
you
may
administrate
it
in
accordance
to
my
wishes
another
chargebut
i
make
no
apology
i
wish
you
to
divide
it
in
three
equal
shares
two
to
be
employed
as
you
see
best
for
the
widows
and
families
of
those
poor
fellows
of
the
preventive
service
victims
of
my
venture
the
third
as
well
as
my
beautiful
peregrine
i
leave
to
the
mate
and
men
who
served
me
so
faithfully
they
have
fled
with
her
and
must
avoid
england
for
some
time
but
renny
will
contrive
to
hear
of
them
they
are
bound
to
return
in
secret
for
tidings
and
i
should
like
to
feel
that
the
misery
i
have
left
behind
me
may
be
mitigated
and
now
dear
adrian
that
is
all
the
man
outside
grows
impatient
i
hear
him
shuffling
his

adrian
seized
his
friend
by
the
hands
with
a
despairing
grip
the
door
rolled
back
with
its
dismal
screech
the
prisoner
smiled
at
him
with
tender
eyes
this
man
whom
all
unwillingly
he
had
robbed
of
his
wifes
heart
was
broken
with
grief
that
he
could
not
save
the
life
that
had
brought
him
misery
here
was
a
friend
to
be
proud
of
even
at
the
gate
of
death
god
be

you

your

your

my
last
words
from
my
death
will
be
born
your
happiness
and
if
its
growth
be
slow
yet
it
will
wax
strong
and
sure
as
the
years
go
by
the
words
broke
from
him
with
prophetic
solemnity
their
hands
fell
apart
and
adrian
led
by
the
jailer
stumbled
forth
blindly
jack
smith
stood
erect
still
smiling
watching
them
were
adrian
to
turn
he
should
find
no
weakness
no
faltering
for
the
final
remembrance
but
adrian
did
not
turn
and
the
door
closed
closed
upon
hope
and
happiness
and
life
shut
in
shame
and
death
out
yonder
with
adrian
was
the
fresh
bright
world
the

sunshine
the
dear

here
the
prison
smells
the
gloom
the
constraint
the
inflicted
dreadful
death
all
his
hardwon
calm
fled
from
him
all
his
youth
his
immense
vitality
woke
up
and
cried
out
in
him
again
he
raised
his
hands
and
pulled
fiercely
at
his
collar
as
if
already
the
rope
were
round
his
neck
strangling
him
his
blood
hammered
in
his
brain

the

threw
up

then
fell
upon

by
sobs

from
the
beautiful
young
brood
that
was
to
have
sprung
from
his
loins
would
have
grafted
on
the

fresh
and

who
loved
him
on
the
evening
of
the
previous
day
lady
landale
and
her
aunt
had
arrived
at
pulwick
the
drive
had
been
a
dismal
one
to
poor
miss
odonoghue
neither
her
angry
expostulations
nor
her
tender
remonstrances
nor
her
attempts
at
consolation
could
succeed
in
drawing
a
connected
sentence
from
molly
who
with
a
fever
spot
of
red
upon
each
cheek
only
roused
herself
from
the
depth
of
thought
in
which
she
seemed
plunged
to
urge
the
coachman
to
greater
speed
miss
odonoghue
tried
the
whole
gamut
of
her
art
in
vain
and
was
obliged
at
last
to
desist
from
sheer
weariness
and
in
much
anxiety
madeleine
and
sophia
were
seated
by
the
fireside
in
the
library
when
the
unexpected
travellers
came
in
upon
them
sophia
in
the
blackest
of
black
weeds
started
guiltily
up
from
the
volume
of
the
corsair
in
which
she
had
been
plunged
while
madeleine
without
manifesting
any
surprise
rose
placidly
laid
aside
her
needleworka
coarse
flannel
frock
evidently
destined
for
charityand
bestowed
upon
her
sister
and
aunt
an
affectionate
though
unexpansive
embrace
she
had
grown
somewhat
thinner
and
more
thoughtfullooking
since
molly
and
she
had
last
met
on
that
fatal
15th
of
march
but
otherwise
was
unchanged
in
her
serene
beauty
molly
clutched
her
wrist
with
a
burning
hand
and
paying
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
other
two
nor
condescending
to
any
preamble
began
at
once
in
hurried
words
to
explain
her
mission
he
has
asked
for
you
madeleine
she
cried
her
eyes
flaming
with
unnatural
brilliance
as
they
sought
her
sisters
mild
gaze
he
has
asked
for
you
i
will
take
you
back
with
me
tomorrow
not
later
than
tomorrow
dont
you
understand
shaking
her
impatiently
as
she
held
her
he
is
in
prison
condemned
to
death
he
has
asked
for
you
he
wants
to
see
you
on
saturdayon
saturday
something
clicked
in
her
throat
and
she
raised
her
hand
to
it
with
an
uneasy
gesture
one
that
those
who
surrounded
her
had
grown
curiously
familiar
with
of
late
madeleine
drew
away
from
her
at
this
address
the
whole
fair
calm
of
her
countenance
troubled
like
a
placid
pool
by
the
casting
of
a
stone
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
down
i
saw
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
condemned
she
said
i
have
prayed
for
him
daily
i
trust
he
repents
i
am
truly
sorry
for
him
from
my
heart
i
forgive
him
the
deception
he
practised
upon
me
but
a
slight
shudder
shook
her
i
could
not
see
him
againsurely
you
could
not
wish
it
of
me
she
spoke
with
such
extreme
gentleness
that
for
a
minute
the
woman
before
her
in
the
seething
turmoil
of
her
soul
failed
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
her
words
you
could
not
go
she
repeated
in
a
bewildered
way
i
could
not
wish
it
of
you
then
with
a
sort
of
shriek
which
drew
tanty
and
miss
sophia
hurriedly
towards
her
dont
you
understandon
saturdayif
it
all
fails
they
will
hang
him
aah
exclaimed
madeleine
with
a
movement
as
if
to
ward
off
the
soundthe
cry
the
gesture
expressive
not
of
grief
but
of
shrinking
repugnance
but
after
a
second
controlling
herself
and
what
should
that
be
now
sister
to
you
or
to
me
she
said
haughtily
lady
landale
clapped
her
hands
together
and
this
is
the
woman
he
loves
she
cried
with
a
shrill
laugh
and
she
staggered
and
sank
back
upon
a
chair
in
an
attitude
of
utter
prostration
molly
molly
exclaimed
her
sister
reprovingly
while
she
glanced
in
much
distress
at
miss
odonoghue
you
are
not
yourself
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
remember
interposed
sophia
in
tragic
tones
that
you
are
speaking
of
the
murderer
of
my
beloved
brother
then
she
dissolved
in
tears
and
was
obliged
to
hide
her
countenance
in
the
folds
of
a
vast
pockethandkerchief
killing
vermin
is
not
murder
cried
molly
fiercely
awakening
from
her
torpor
miss
odonoghue
who
in
the
most
unwonted
silence
had
been
watching
the
scene
with
her
shrewd
eyes
here
seized
the
horrified
sophia
by
the
elbow
and
trundled
her
with
a
great
deal
of
energy
and
determination
to
the
door
get
out
of
this
you
foolish
creature
she
said
in
a
stern
whisper
and
dont
attempt
to
show
your
nose
here
again
till
i
give
it
leave
to
walk
in
then
returning
to
the
sisters
and
looking
from
mollys
haggard
distracted
face
to
madeleines
pale
one
if
you
take
my
advice
my
dear
she
said
a
little
drily
to
the
latter
you
will
not
make
so
many
bones
about
going
to
see
that
poor
lad
in
the
prison
and
youll
stop
wrangling
with
your
sister
for
she
is
just
not
able
to
bear
it
we
shall
start
tomorrow
molly
turning
to
lady
landale
and
speaking
in
the
tone
of
one
addressing
a
sick
child
and
madeleine
will
be
quite
ready
as
early
as
you
wish
my
dear
aunt
said
madeleine
growing
white
to
the
lips
i
am
very
sorry
if
molly
is
ill
but
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
think
i
can
yield
to
her
wishes
in
this
matter
i
could
not
go
i
could
not
it
is
impossible
hear
her
cried
the
other
starting
from
her
seat
oh
what
are
you
made
of
is
it
water
that
runs
in
your
veins
you
that
he
lovesher
voice
broke
into
a
wailyou
who
ought
to
be
so
proud
to
know
he
loves
you
even
though
your
heart
be
broken
you
refuse
to
go
to
him
refuse
his
last
request
come
to
the
light
she
went
on
seizing
the
girls
wrists
again
let
me
look
at
you
bah
you
never
loved
him
you
dont
even
understand
what
it
is
to
love
but
what
could
one
expect
from
you
who
abandoned
him
in
the
moment
of
danger
you
are
afraid
afraid
of
the
painful
scene
the
discomfort
the
sight
of
the
prison
of
his
beautiful
face
worn
and
changedafraid
of
the
discredit
oh
i
know
you
i
know
you
but
mind
you
madeleine
de
savenaye
he
wishes
to
see
you
and
i
swore
you
would
go
to
him
and
you
shall
go
if
i
have
to
drag
you
with
these
hands
of
mine
her
grip
was
so
fierce
her
eyes
so
savage
the
words
so
strange
that
madeleine
screamed
faintly
she
is
mad
and
was
amazed
that
miss
odonoghue
did
not
rush
to
the
rescue
but
miss
odonoghue
peering
at
her
from
the
depths
of
her
armchair
merely
said
snappishly
ah
child
cant
you
say
you
will
go
and
have
done
oughtnt
you
to
be
ashamed
to
be
so
hardhearted
and
mopped
her
perspiring
and
agitated
countenance
with
her
kerchief
then
upon
the
girls
bewildered
mind
dawned
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
and
blushing
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
she
looked
at
her
sister
with
a
growing
horror
oh
molly
molly
she
said
again
with
a
sort
of
groan
will
you
go
cried
molly
from
between
her
set
teeth
again
the
girl
shuddered
less
than
evernow
she
murmured
and
as
molly
threw
her
from
her
almost
with
violence
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
fell
weeping
bitter
tears
upon
the
couch
behind
her
lady
landale
with
great
steps
stormed
up
and
down
the
room
her
eyes
fixed
on
space
her
lips
moving
now
and
again
a
word
escaped
her
then
sometimes
hurled
at
her
sister
sometimes
only
in
desperate
communing
with
herself
base
cowardly
mean
oh
my
god
cruelcruel
to
go
back
without
her
after
a
little
with
a
sudden
change
of
mood
she
halted
and
stood
a
while
as
if
in
deep
reflection
holding
her
hand
to
her
head
then
crossing
the
room
hurriedly
she
knelt
down
and
flung
her
arms
round
the
weeping
figure
ma
petite
madeleine
she
said
in
a
voice
of
the
most
piteous
pleading
thou
and
i
we
were
always
good
friends
thou
canst
not
have
the
heart
to
be
so
cruel
to
me
now
see
my
darling
he
must
die
they
sayoh
madeleine
madeleine
and
he
asked
for
you
the
one
thing
he
told
ren
the
only
thing
we
could
do
for
him
on
earth
was
to
let
him
see
you
once
more
my
little
sister
you
cannot
refuse
he
loves
you
what
has
he
done
to
offend
you
your
pride
cannot
forgive
him
for
being
what
he
is
i
suppose
yet
such
as
he
is
you
should
be
proud
of
him
he
is
too
noble
too
straightforward
to
have
intentionally
deceived
you
if
he
did
wrong
it
was
for
love
of
you
madeleine
madeleine
her
tones
trailed
away
into
a
moan
miss
odonoghue
sobbed
loudly
from
her
corner
madeleine
who
had
looked
at
her
sister
at
first
with
repulsion
seemed
moved
she
placed
her
hands
upon
her
shoulders
and
gazed
sadly
into
the
flushed
face
my
poor
molly
she
said
hesitatingly
this
is
dreadful
but
i
tooi
too
was
led
into
deceit
into
folly
she
blushed
painfully
i
would
not
blame
you
it
was
not
your
fault
that
you
were
carried
away
in
his
ship
you
went
only
for
my
sake
i
cannot
forget
that
yet
that
he
should
have
this
unhappy
power
over
you
too
you
with
your
good
husband
you
a
married
woman
oh
my
poor
sister
it
is
terrible
he
is
a
wicked
man
i
pray
that
he
may
yet
repent
heavens
interrupted
molly
her
passion
up
in
arms
again
loosening
as
she
spoke
her
clasp
upon
her
sister
and
rising
to
her
feet
to
look
down
on
her
with
withering
scorn
have
i
not
made
myself
clear
are
you
deaf
stupid
as
well
as
heartless
it
is
youyouyou
he
loves
you
he
wants
what
am
i
to
him
with
a
curious
sob
half
of
laughter
half
of
anguish
your
pious
fears
are
quite
unfounded
as
far
as
he
is
concernedthe
wicked
man
as
you
call
him
oh
he
spurns
my
love
with
as
much
horror
as
even
you
could
wish
molly
aymolly
and
mollyhow
shocked
you

yes
i

him
i

care
who
hears
it
i
love
himadrian
knowshe
is
not
as
virtuous
as
you
evidently
for
adrian
pities
me
he
is
doing
all
he
can
though
they
say
it
is
in
vain
to
get
a
reprieve
for
himthough
i
do
love
him
while
youyou
are
too
good
too
immaculate
even
to
soil
your
dainty
foot
upon
the
floor
of
his
prison
that
floor
that
i
could
kiss
because
his
shoe
has
trod
it
but
it
is
impossible
no
human
being
could
be
so
hard
least
of
all
you
whom
i
have
seen
turn
sick
at
the
sight
of
a
dead
wormmadeleine
crouching
down
in
the
former
imploring
manner
while
her
breast
heaved
with
dry
tearless
sobs
it
cannot
hurt
you
you
who
loved
him
and
then
with
the
old
pitiful
cry
it
is
the
only
thing
he
wants
and
he
loves
you
madeleine
disengaged
herself
from
the
clinging
hands
with
a
gesture
almost
of
disgust
listen
to
me
she
said
after
a
pause
try
and
compose
yourself
and
understand
all
this
month
i
have
had
time
to
think
to
realise
to
pray
i
have
seen
what
the
world
is
worth
that
it
is
full
of
horror
of
sin
of
trouble
of
dreadful
dissensionsthat
its
sorrow
far
outweighs
its
happiness
i
have
suffered
her
pretty
lips
quivered
an
instant
but
she
hardened
herself
and
went
on
but
it
is
better
soit
was
gods
will
it
was
to
show
me
where
to
find
real
comfort
the
true
peace
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
i
was
only
waiting
to
see
you
again
and
tell
younext
week
i
am
going
back
to
the
convent
for
ever
oh
why
did
we
leave
it
molly
why
did
we
leave
it
she
broke
down
and
the
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
lady
landale
had
listened
in
silence
wellis
that
all
she
said
impatiently
when
her
sister
ceased
speaking
while
in
the
background
tanty
groaned
out
a
protest
and
bewailed
that
she
was
alive
to
see
the
day
what
does
it
matter
what
you
do
afterwardsyou
can
go
to
the
conventgo
where
you
will
then
but
what
has
that
to
say
to
your
visit
to
him
now
i
have
done
with
all
human
love
said
madeleine
solemnly
crossing
her
hands
on
her
breast
and
looking
upward
with
inspired
eyes
i
did
love
this
man
once
she
answered
hardening
herself
to
speak
firmly
though
again
her
lips
quiveredhe
himself
killed
that
love
by
his
own
doing
i
trusted
him
he
betrayed
that
trust
he
would
have
betrayed
me
but
that
i
have
forgiven
it
is
past
and
done
with
but
to
go
and
see
him
now
to
stir
up
in
my
heart
not
the
old
love
it
could
not
be
but
agitation
sorrowto
disturb
this
quietness
of
soul
this
calm
which
god
has
given
me
at
last
after
so
much
prayer
and
struggleno
noit
would
not
be
right
it
cannot
be
moreover
if
i
would
i
could
not
indeed
i
could
not
the
very
thought
of
it
all
the
disgrace
that
place
of
sin
and
shame
of
him
in
chains
condemneda
criminala
murderer
a
nervous
shudder
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
she
seemed
in
truth
to
sicken
and
grow
faint
like
one
forced
to
face
some
hideous
nauseating
spectacle
as
for
him
she
went
on
in
low
feeble
tones
it
will
be
the
best
too
god
knows
i
forgive
him
that
i
am
sorry
for
him
that
i
regret
his
terrible
fate
but
i
feel
it
would
be
worse
for
him
to
see
meif
he
must
die
it
would
be
wrong
to
distract
him
from
his
last
preparations
and
it
would
only
be
a
useless
pain
to
him
for
i
could
not
pretendhe
would
see
that
i
despise
him
i
thought
i
loved
a
noble
gentleman
not
one
who
was
even
then
playing
with
crime
and
cheating
the
faint
passionless
voice
had
hardly
ceased
before
with
a
loud
cry
molly
sprang
at
her
sister
as
if
she
would
have
strangled
her
oh
unnatural
wretch
she
exclaimed
you
are
not
fit
to
live
tanty
rushed
forward
and
dragged
the
infuriated
woman
away
madeleine
rose
up
stifflyswayed
a
moment
as
she
stoodand
then
fell
unconscious
to
the
ground





next
day
in
the
dawn
lady
landale
came
into
her
sisters
bedroom
her
circled
eyes
her
drawn
face
bespeaking
a
sleepless
night
madeleine
was
lying
beautiful
and
white
like
a
broken
lily
in
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
sophia
an
unlovely
spectacle
in
curl
papers
wizened
and
redeyed
from
her
nights
watch
looked
up
warningly
from
the
armchair
beside
her
but
molly
went
unhesitatingly
to
the
window
pulled
the
curtains
unbarred
the
shutters
and
then
walked
over
to
the
bed
as
she
approached
madeleine
opened
her
blue
eyes
and
gazed
at
her
beseechingly
there
is
yet
time
said
molly
in
a
hollow
voice
get
up
and
come
with
me
the
wan
face
upon
the
pillow
grew
whiter
still
the
old
horror
grew
in
the
uplifted
eyes
the
wan
lips
murmured
i
cannot
there
was
an
immense
strength
of
resistance
in
the
girls
very
feebleness
molly
turned
away
abruptly
then
back
again
once
more
at
least
you
will
send
him
a
message
madeleine
drew
a
deep
breath
closed
her
eyes
a
moment
and
seemed
to
whisper
a
prayer
then
aloud
she
said
while
like
a
shadow
so
faint
was
it
a
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
tell
him
that
i
forgive
him
that
i
forgive
him
freelythat
i
shall
always
pray
for
him
the
flush
grew
deeper
tell
him
too
that
i
shall
never
be
any
mans
bride
now
she
closed
her
eyes
again
and
the
colour
slowly
ebbed
away
molly
stood
her
black
brows
drawn
gazing
down
upon
her
in
silencedid
she
love
him
after
all
who
can
fathom
the
mystery
of
anothers
heart
i
will
tell
him
she
answered
at
last
goodbye
madeleinei
shall
never
see
you
or
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
she
left
the
room
with
a
slow
heavy
step
madeleine
shivered
and
with
both
hands
clasped
the
silver
crucifix
that
hung
around
her
neck
two
great
tears
escaped
from
her
black
lashes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
miss
sophia
moaned
she
poor
soul
had
had
tragedy
enough
at
last





when
the
jailer
brought
in
the
midday
meal
after
adrians
departure
he
found
the
prisoner
seated
very
quietly
at
his
table
his
open
bible
before
him
but
his
eyes
fixed
dreamily
upon
the
space
of
dim
whitewashed
wall
and
his
mind
evidently
far
away
upon
his
guardians
entrance
he
roused
himself
however
and
begged
him
when
he
should
return
for
the
dish
to
restore
neatness
to
the
bed
and
to
assist
him
in
the
ordering
of
his
toilet
which
he
wished
to
be
spick
and
span
for
i
expect
a
visitor
said
captain
jack
gravely
when
in
due
course
the
fellow
had
carried
out
these
wishes
with
the
surly
goodnature
characteristic
of
him
jack
set
himself
to
wait
the
square
of
sky
through
his
window
grew
from
dazzling
white
to
deepest
blue
the
shadows
travelled
along
the
blank
walls
the
street
noises
rose
and
fell
in
capricious
gusts
the
church
bells
jangled
all
the
myriad
sounds
which
had
come
to
measure
his
solitary
day
struck
their
familiar
course
upon
his
ear
yet
the
expected
visitor
delayed
but
the
captain
among
other
things
had
learnt
to
possess
his
soul
in
patience
of
late
and
so
as
he
slowly
paced
his
cell
after
his
wont
he
betrayed
neither
irritation
nor
melancholy
if
she
did
not
come
today
then
it
would
be
tomorrow
he
had
no
doubt
of
this
the
afternoon
had
wanedgolden
without
full
of
grey
shadows
in
the
prison
roomwhen
light
footfalls
mingled
with
the
wellknown
heavy
tread
and
jangle
of
keys
along
the
echoing
passage
there
was
the
murmur
of
a
womans
voice
a
word
of
gruff
reply
and
the
next
moment
a
tall
form
wrapped
in
a
manyfolded
black
cloak
and
closely
veiled
advanced
a
few
steps
into
the
room
while
as
before
the
turnkey
retired
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
his
heart
beating
so
thickly
that
for
the
moment
utterance
was
impossible
captain
jack
made
one
hurried
pace
forward
with
outstretched
hands
only
to
check
himself
however
and
let
them
fall
by
his
side
he
would
meet
her
calmly
humbly
as
he
had
resolved
the
woman
threw
back
her
veil
and
it
was
mollys
dark
gaze
mollys
brown
face
flushed
and
haggard
yet
always
beautiful
that
looked
out
of
the
black
frame
an
ashen
pallor
spread
over
the
prisoners
countenance
madeleine
he
asked
in
a
whisper
then
with
a
loud
ring
of
stern
demand

she
would

it
is
a
sort
of
unwritten
law
that
the
supremely
afflicted
have
the
right
where
possible
to
the
gratification
of
the
least
of
their
wishes
that
madeleine
could
refuse
to

to
him
in

spat
the

fiercely
as
if
at
the
offenders
face
there
fell
a
minutes
silence
broken
only
by
a
few
labouring
deepdrawn
breaths
from
the
prisoners
oppressed
lungs
then
he
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
not
a
muscle
moving
his
eyes
fixed
his
jaw
set
molly
trembled
before
this
composure
beneath
which
she
divined
a
suffering
so
intense
that
her
own
frail
barriers
of
selfrestraint
were
wellnigh
broken
down
by
a
torrent
of
passionate
pity
but
she
braced
herself
with
the
feeling
of
the
moments
urgency
she
had
no
time
to
lose

she
cried
in
low
hurried
tones
laying
a
hand
upon
his
folded
arm
and
then
drawing
it
away
again
as
if
frightened
by
the
rigid
tension
she
felt
there
waste

jackjack
her
voice
rose
as
high
as
she
dare
lift
it
but
no
statue
could
be
more
unhearing
the
woman
cast
a
desperate
look
around
her
hearkened
fearfully
all
was
silent
within
the
prison
then
with
tremulous
haste
she
cast
off
her
immense
cloak
pulled
her
bonnet
from
her
head
divested
herself
of
her
long
full
skirt
and
stood
a
strange
vision
lithe
unconscious
unashamed
her
slender
womans
figure
clad
in
complete
mans
raiment
with
the
exception
of
the
coat
her
dark
head
cropped
and
curly
her
face
with
its
feverbloom
rising
flowerlike
above
the
folds
of
her
white
shirt
with
anxious
haste
she
compared
herself
with
the
prisoner
ren
told
me
well
she
said
with
your
coat
upon
me
none
would
tell
the
difference
in
this
dark
room
i
am
nearly
as
tall
as
you
too
thanks
be
to
god
that
he
made
me
so
jack
calling
in
his
ear
dont
you
see
dont
you
understand
it
is
all
quite
easy
you
have
only
to
put
on
these
clothes
of
mine
this
cloak
the
bonnet
comes
quite
over
the
face
stoop
a
little
as
you
go
out
and
hold
this
handkerchief
to
your
face
as
if
in
tears
the
carriage
waits
outside
and
ren
the
rest
is
planned
i
shall
sit
on
the
bed
with
your
coat
on
it
is
a
chancea
certainty
when
i
found
ren
had
failed
i
swore
that
i
would
save
you
yet
ever
since
i
came
from
pulwick
this
morning
he
and
i
have
worked
together
upon
this
last
plan
there
is
not
a
flaw
it
must
succeed
oh
god
he
does
not
hear
me
jackjack
she
shook
him
with
a
sort
of
fury
then
falling
at
his
feet
clasped
his
knees
for
gods
sakefor
gods
sake
he
sighed
and
again
came
the
murmur
she
would
not
come
he
lifted
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
looked
round
then
down
at
her
as
if
from
a
great
height
she
saw
that
he
was
aroused
at
last
sprang
to
her
feet
and
poured
out
the
details
of
the
scheme
again
i
run
no
risk
you
see
they
would
not
dare
to
punish
me
a
womanlady
landaleeven
if
they
could
be
quick
the
precious
moments
are
going
by
i
gave
the
man
some
gold
to
leave
us
as
long
as
he
could
but
any
moment
he
may
be
upon
us
poor
woman
said
jack
and
his
voice
seemed
as
far
off
as
his
gaze
see
these
chains
she
staggered
back
an
instant
but
the
next
crying
the
filethe
filethat
was
why
ren
gave
it
to
me
she
seized
the
skirt
as
it
lay
at
her
feet
and
striving
with
agonised
endeavours
to
control
the
trembling
of
her
hands
drew
forth
from
its
pocket
a
file
and
would
have
taken
his
wrist
but
he
held
his
hands
above
his
head
out
of
her
reach
while
a
strange
smile
almost
of
triumph
parted
his
lips
the
bitterness
of
death
is
past
he
said
she
tore
at
him
in
a
frenzy
but
repulsed
by
his
immobility
fell
again
broken
at
his
feet
in
a
torrent
of
words
she
besought
him
for
adrians
sake
for
the
sake
of
the
beautiful
world
of
his
youth
of
the
sweetness
of
lifein
her
madness
at
last
for
her
own
sake
she
had
ruined
him
but
she
would
atone
she
would
make
him
happy
yet
if
he
died
it
was
death
to
her
when
at
length
her
voice
sank
away
from
sheer
exhaustion
he
helped
her
to
rise
and
seated
her
on
the
chair
then
told
her
quietly
that
he
was
quite
determined
go
home
said
he
and
leave
me
in
peace
i
thank
you
for
what
you
would
have
done
thank
you
for
trying
to
bring
madeleine
he
paused
a
moment
how
purely
he
had
loved
herand
twice
twice
she
had
failed
him
yet
i
do
not
blame
her
he
went
on
as
if
to
himself
i
did
not
deserve
to
see
her
and
it
has
made
all
the
rest
easy
remember
again
addressing
the
woman
whom
hopelessness
seemed
for
a
moment
to
have
benumbed
that
if
you
would
yet
do
me
a
kindness
be
kind
to
her
if
you
would
atoneatone
to
adrian
to
adrian
echoed
molly
stung
to
the
quick
with
a
pale
smile
of
exceeding
bitterness
and
with
a
rush
of
pride
strength
returned
to
her
i
leave
you
resolved
to
die
then
she
asked
him
fiercely
you
leave
me
glad
to
die
he
replied
unhesitatingly
she
spoke
no
more
but
got
up
to
replace
her
garments
he
assisted
her
in
silence
but
as
his
awkward
bound
hands
touched
her
she
shuddered
away
from
him
as
she
gathered
the
cloak
round
her
shoulders
again
there
was
a
noise
of
heavy
feet
at
the
door
the
jailer
thrust
in
his
rusty
head
and
looked
furtively
from
the
prisoner
to
his
visitor
as
they
stood
silently
apart
from
each
other
then
making
a
sign
to
some
one
whose
dark
figure
was
shadowed
behind
him
without
entered
with
a
hesitating
sidelong
step
and
drawing
captain
jack
on
one
side
whispered
in
his
ear
the
blacksmiths
yonder
hes
come
to
measure
you
captain
for
them
there
irons
you
know
ofbest
get
the
lady
quietly
away
for
he
wunnut
wait
no
longer
the
prisoner
smiled
sternly
i
am
ready
he
said
aloud
ill
keep
him
outside
a
minute
or
two
added
the
man
wiping
his
brow
evidently
much
relieved
by
his
charges
calmness
i
kep
him
back
as
long
as
i
couldbut
happen
its
allus
best
to
hurry
the
parting
after
all
he
moved
away
upon
tiptoe
in
instinctive
tribute
to
the
ladys
sorrow
and
drew
the
door
to
molly
threw
back
her
veil
which
she
had
lowered
upon
his
entrance
her
face
was
livid
what
is
it
she
asked
articulating
with
difficulty
nothinga
fellow
to
see
to
my
irons
he
moved
his
hands
as
he
spoke
and
she
understood
him
as
he
had
hoped
to
refer
only
to
his
manacles
she
drew
a
gasping
breath
how
they
watched
him
yet
all
was
not
lost
after
all
i
will
leave
the
file
she
said
in
a
quick
whisper
you
will
reflect
there
is
yet
tomorrow
and
rushed
to
hide
it
in
his
bed
but
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
his
patience
worn
out
at
length
useless
he
answered
harshly
i
shall
not
use
it
moreover
it
would
be
found
and
i
am
sure
it
is
not
your
wish
to
bring
unnecessary
hardship
upon
my
last
moments
i
should
lose
the
only
thing
that
is
left
to
me
the
comfort
of
being
alone
and
tomorrow
i
shall
see
no
one
the
door
groaned
apart
very
sorry
mum
came
the
husky
voice
in
the
opening
times
up
she
turned
a
look
of
agony
upon
captain
jacks
determined
figure
was
this
to
be
the
end
was
she
to
leave
him
so
without
even
one
kind
word
alas
poor
soul
all
her
hopes
had
fallen
to
thisa
parting
word
he
was
unpitying
his
arms
were
folded
he
made
no
sign
she
took
a
step
away
and
swayed
the
turnkey
came
forward
compassionately
to
lead
her
out
but
the
next
instant
she
wheeled
round
and
stood
alone
and
erect
braced
up
by
the
extremity
of
her
anguish
i
have
a
message
she
cried
as
if
the
words
were
forced
from
her
i
could
not
make
her
come
but
i
made
her
send
you
a
message
she
told
me
to
say
that
she
forgave
you
freely
that
she
would
always
pray
for
you
she
bade
me
tell
you
too
that
she
would
never
be
any
mans
bride
now
it
had
been
like
the
rending
of
body
and
soul
to
tell
him
this
as
she
saw
the
condemned
mans
face
quiver
and
flush
at
last
out
of
its
impassiveness
she
thought
hell
itself
could
hold
no
more
hideous
torment
he
extended
his
arms
now
welcome
death
he
exclaimed
and
she
turned
and
fled
down
the
passage
as
though
driven
upon
this
last
cry





eh
he
be
a
strange
one

launched
on
the
great
wave
sir
adrian
made
at
first
personally
then
through
miss
odonoghue
two
attempts
to
induce
his
wife
to
return
to
pulwick
or
at
any
rate
to
leave
lancaster
on
the
next
day
but
the
contempt
then
the
fury
which
she
opposed
to
their
reasoning
rendered
it
worse
than
useless
the
very
sight
of
her
husband
indeed
seemed
to
exasperate
the
unfortunate
woman
to
such
a
degree
that
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
concerning
her
he
resolved
to
spare
her
even
to
the
consciousness
of
his
presence
and
absented
himself
altogether
from
the
house
miss
odonoghue
unable
to
cope
with
a
state
of
affairs
at
once
so
distressing
and
so
unbecoming
finally
retired
to
her
own
apartment
with
a
book
of
piety
and
some
gruel
and
abandoned
all
further
endeavour
to
guide
her
unruly
relations
so
that
molly
found
herself
left
to
her
own
resources
in
the
guardianship
of
ren
the
only
company
her
misery
could
tolerate
three
times
she
went
to
the
castle
to
be
met
each
time
with
the
announcement
that
by
the
express
wish
of
the
prisoner
no
visitors
were
to
be
admitted
to
him
again
then
in
restless
wandering
about
the
streetsonce
entering
the
little
chapel
where
the
silent
tabernacle
seemed
with
its
closed
door
to
offer
no
relenting
to
the
stormy
cry
of
her
soul
and
sent
her
forth
uncomforted
in
the
very
midst
of
rens
humble
beadtelling
to
pace
the
flags
anewso
the
terrible
day
wore
to
a
close
for
her
and
so
that
night
came
precursor
of
the
most
terrible
day
of
all
the
exhaustion
of
lady
landales
body
produced
at
last
a
fortunate
torpor
of
mind
flung
upon
her
bed
she
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
and
tanty
who
announced
her
intention
of
watching
her
when
rens
guardianship
had
of
necessity
to
cease
had
the
satisfaction
of
informing
adrian
as
he
crept
into
the
house
like
one
who
had
no
business
there
of
this
consoling
fact
before
retiring
herself
to
the
capacious
armchair
in
which
she
heroically
purposed
to
spend
the
night
the
sun
was
bright
in
the
heavens
there
was
a
clatter
and
bustle
in
the
street
when
molly
woke
with
a
great
start
out
of
this
sleep
of
exhaustion
her
heart
beating
with
heavy
strokes
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
gazed
upon
her
surroundings
with
startled
eyes
what
was
this
strange
feeling
of
oppression
of
terror
why
was
she
in
this
sordid
little
room
why
was
her
hair
cut
short
ah
my
god
memory
returned
upon
her
all
too
swiftly
it
was
for
todaytoday
and
she
was
perhaps
too
late
she
might
never
see
him
again
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
was
suffocating
sickening
as
she
slipped
out
of
bed
for
a
moment
she
hardly
dared
consult
the
little
watch
that
lay
ticking
upon
her
dressing
table
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
past
seven
there
was
yet
time
the
energy
of
her
desire
conquered
the
weakness
of
her
overwrought
nerves
noiselessly
so
as
to
avoid
awakening
the
slumbering
watcher
in
the
armchair
but
steadily
she
clothed
herself
wrapt
the
dark
mantle
round
her
and
then
pausing
for
a
moment
to
gaze
with
a
fierce
disdain
at
the
unconscious
face
of
miss
odonoghue
which
with
snores
emerging
energetically
and
regularly
from
the
great
hooked
nose
presented
a
weird
and
witchlike
vision
in
the
frame
of
a
nightcap
fearfully
and
wonderfully
befrilled
crept
from
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
at
rens
door
she
paused
and
knocked
he
opened
on
the
instant
from
his
worn
face
she
guessed
that
he
had
been
up
all
night
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
as
he
saw
her
and
glanced
meaningly
towards
the
bed
the
words
she
would
have
spoken
expired
in
a
quickdrawn
breath
her
husband
with
face
of
deathlike
pallor
and
silvered
hair
abroad
upon
the
pillow
lay
upon
the
poor
couch
still
in
his
yesterday
attire
but
covered
carefully
with
a
cloak
his
breast
rose
and
fell
peacefully
with
his
regular
breath
the
scorn
with
which
she
had
looked
at
miss
odonoghue
now
shot
forth
a
thousand
times
intensified
from
mollys
circled
eyes
upon
the
prostrate
figure
asleep
she
cried
and
then
with
that
incongruity
with
which
things
trivial
and
irrelevant
come
upon
us
even
in
the
supremest
moments
of
life
the
thought
struck
her
sharply
how
old
a
man
he
was
her
lip
curved
yes
my
ladyasleep
answered

seemed
as
if
the
faithful
peasant
had
read

her
soul
thank
god
asleep
it
is
enough
to
have
to
lose
one
good
gentleman
from
the
world
this
day
if
his
honour
were
not
sleeping
at
last
i
should
not
answer
for
himi

took
upon
myself
to
put
some
of
the
medicine
that
he
has
had
to
take
now
and
again
when
his
sorrows
come
upon
him
and
he
cannot
rest
into
his
soup
last
night
it
has
had
a
good
effect
his
honour
will
sleep
three
or
four
hours
still
and
that
my
lady
must
be
his
honour
has
suffered
enough
these
last
days
god
knows
the
wife
turned
away
with
an
impatient
gesture
look
madame
at
his
white
hairs
all
white
nowthey
that
were
of
a
brown
so
beautiful
all
but
a
few
locks
only
a
few
months
past
well
may
he
look
old
when
was
ever
any
one
made
to
suffer
as
he
has
been
in
only
forty
years
of
life
ah
my
lady
we
were
at
least
tranquil
upon
our
island
there
was
a
volume
of
reproach
in
the
quiet
simplicity
of
the
words
though
lady
landale
was
too
bent
on
her
own
purpose
to
heed
them
but
she
felt
that
they
lodged
in
her
mind
that
she
would
find
them
there
later
but
not
nownot
now
it
is
to
be
for
nine
oclock
you
know
she
said
with
desperate
calmness
i
must
see
him
again
i
must
see
him
well
alone
i
shall
not
be
able
to
get
a
good
place
in
the
crowd
oh
i
would
see
all
she
added
with
a
terrible
laugh
ren
cast
a
glance
at
his
masters
placid
face
i
am
ready
to
come
with
my
lady
he
said
then
and
took
his
hat
a
turbulent
tender
april
day
it
was
gusts
of
west
wind
balmy
and
sweet
with
all
the
sweet
budding
life
of
the
fields
beyond
came
eddying
up
the
dusty
streets
and
blowing
merrily
into
the
faces
of
the
holiday
crowd
that
already
pressed
in
a
steady
stream
towards
the
castle
courtyard
to
see
the
hanging
in
those
days
there
were
hangings
so
many
after
assizes
that
an
execution
could
hardly
be
said
to
possess
the
interest
of
novelty
but
there
were
circumstances
enough
attending
the
forthcoming
show
to
give
it
quite
a
piquancy
of
its
own
in
the
eyes
of
the
worthy
lancastrian
burghers
who
hurried
with
wives
and
children
to
the
place
of
doom
anxious
to
secure
sitting
or
standing
room
with
a
good
view
of
the
gallowstree
it
was
not
every
day
indeed
that
a
gentleman
was
hanged
so
handsome
a
man
too
as
the
rumours
went
and
so
daredevil
a
fellow
friend
of
the
noble
family
of
landale
and
a
murderer
of
its
most
respected
member
could
justice
ever
have
served
up
a
spicier
dish
whereon
to
regale
the
multitude
first
the
courtyard
then
the
walls
the
roofs
of
the
adjoining
houses
swarmed
with
an
eager
crowd
every
space
of
ground
and
slate
and
tile
every
ledge
and
window
was
occupied
as
thick
as
bees
they
hungmen
women
and
children
a
sea
of
white
faces
pressed
together
each
still
yet
all
as
instinct
with
tremulous
movement
as
a
field
of
corn
in
the
wind
while
the
hoarse
indescribable
murmur
that
seizes
one
with
so
strange
and
fearsome
an
impression
the
voice
of
the
multitude
rose
and
fell
with
a
mighty
pulsation
broken
here
and
there
by
the
shriller
cry
of
a
child
overhead
the
sky
a
delicious
spring
blue
sky
flecked
with
tiny
white
clouds
looked
down
like
a
great
smile
upon
the
crowd
that
laughed
and
joked
beneath
no
pity
in
heaven
or
on
earth
but
as
the
felon
came
out
into
the
air
which
warm
and
fickle
puffed
against
his
cheek
he
cast
one
steady
glance
around
upon
the
black
human
hive
and
then
looked
up
into
the
white
flecked
ether
without
the
quiver
of
a
nerve
he
drew
the
spring
breath
into
his
lungs
with
a
grateful
expansion
of
his
deep
chest
how
fresh
it
was
and
the
sky
how
fair
and
blue
as
the
eagerly
expected
group
emerged
from
the
prison
door
and
was
greeted
by
a
roar
that
curdled
the
blood
in
at
least
one
womans
heart
there
an
old
irish
hag
who
sat
in
a
coign
of
vantage
hugging
her
knees
and
crooning
a
little
black
pipe
held
in
her
toothless
jaws
ceased
her
dismal
hum
to
concentrate
all
her
attention
upon
the
condemned
man
the
creature
was
well
known
for
miles
around
as
a
constant
attendant
at
such
spectacles
and
had
become
in
the
course
of
time
a
privileged
spectator
no
one
would
have
dreamt
of
disputing
the
first
place
to
old
judy
since
the
day
when
still
a
young
woman
she
had
seen
her
two
sons
mere
lads
hanged
the
one
for
sheepstealing
the
other
for
harbouring
the
booty
she
had
by
a
strange
freak
of
nature
taken
a
taste
for
the
spectacle
of
justice
at
work
and
what
had
been
the
cause
of
her
greatest
sorrow
became
the
only
solace
of
her
life
judy
and
her
pipe
had
become
as
familiar
a
figure
at
the
periodical
entertainment
as
the
executioner
himselfmore
so
indeed
for
she
had
seen
many
generations
of
these
latter
and
could
compare
their
styles
with
the
judgment
of
a
connoisseur
but
as
captain
jack
advanced
the
pallor
of
his
clean
shorn
handsome
face
illumined
not
so
much
by
the
morning
sun
without
it
seemed
as
by
the
shining
of
the
bright
spirit
within
as
gallantly
clad
as
he
had
ever
been
even
in
the
old
bath
days
when
he
had
been
courting
fair
madeleine
de
savenaye
his
head
proudly
uplifted
his
tread
firm
strong
of
soul
strong
of
bodysome
chord
was
struck
in
the
perverted
old
heart
that
had
so
long
revelled
in
unholy
and
gruesome
pleasure
she
drew
the
pipe
from
her
lips
and
broke
out
into
screeching
lamentations
oh

she
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
shook
her
fist
wildly
in
the
face
of
one
of
the
sheriffs
men
a
woman
in
the
crowd
standing
rigid
and
motionless
enveloped
in
mourning

here
suddenly
caught
up
the

a

cried
a
man
beside
her
who
seemed
in
such
anxiety
concerning
her
as
to
pay
little
heed
to
the
solemn
procession
which
was
now
attracting
universal
attention
let
me
take
you
away
but
she
looked
at
him
with
a
distraught
unseeing
eye
and
pulled
at
the
collar
of
her
dress
as
if
she

when

back
to
her
home
from
lancaster
it
was
held
by
every
one
who
saw
her
that
death
had
laid
his
cold
finger
on
her
forehead
and
that
her
surrender
to
his
call
could
only
be
a
matter
of
hours
the
physician
in
attendance
could
point
out
no
reasonable
ground
for
hope
such
a
case
had
never
come
within
his
experience
or
knowledge
and
he
was
with
difficulty
induced
to
believe
that
it
was
not
the

of

violence

no

felt
for
the
miserable
wretch
in
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
imagination
aiding
her
she
realised
suddenly
the
horror
of
his
death
throes
and
this
vivid
realisation
was
followed
by
the
actual
simulacrum
of
the
torture
we
have
seen
hysterical
subjects
simulate
in
the

manner
diverse
diseases
of
which
they
themselves
are

cannot
say
according
to
his
lights

had
bled
the
patient
as
he
would
have
bled
by

to
recall
to

one
actually
cut
down
from
the
beam
but
although
the
young
blood
did
flow
bearing
testimony
to
the
fact
that
the
heart
still
beat
in
that
deathlike
frame
the
vitality
left
seemed
so
faint
as
to
defy
the
power
of
human
ministration
the
flame
of
life
barely
flickered
but
the
powers
of
youth
were
of
greater
strength
in
the
unconscious
body
than
could
have
been
suspected
and
gradually
almost
imperceptibly
they
asserted
themselves
with
the
return
of
animation
however
came
a
new
danger
fever
burning
devastating
more
terrible
even
than
the
almost
mortal
syncope
that
fever
of
the
brain
which
wastes
like
the
rack
before
which
science
stands
helpless
and
the
watcher
sinks
into
despair
at
his
impotence
to
screen
a
beloved
sufferer
from
the
horrible
everrecurring
phantoms
of
delirium
had
not
sir
adrian
intuitively
known
wellnigh
every
act
of
the
drama
which
had
already
been
so
fatal
to
his
house
mollys
frenzied
utterances
would
have
told
him
all
every
secret
incident
of
that
storm
of
passion
which
had
desolated
her
life
was
laid
bare
to
his
sorrowing
hearther
aspirations
for
an
ideal
centred
suddenly
upon
one
man
her
love
rapture
cruelly
baulked
at
every
step
the
consuming
of
that
love
fire
resisting
all
frustration
of
hope
all
efforts
of
conscience
of
honour
how
her
whole
being
became
merged
into
that
of
the
man
she
loved
and
whom
she
had
ruined
her
life
in
his
life
her
very
breath
in
his
breath
and
then
the
lamentable
inevitable
end
the
fearful
confrontation
with
his
death
again
and
again
in
never
ceasing
repetition
was
that
fair
most
dear
body
that
harrowed
soul
dragged
step
by
step
through
every
iota
of
the
past
torture
always
to
fall
at
last
into
the
same
stillness
of
exhaustionappalling
image
of
final
death
that
wrung
adrian
with
untold
agonies
of
despair
for
many
days
this
condition
of
things
lasted
unaltered
in
the
physicians
own
words
it
was
impossible
that
life
could
much
longer
resist
such
fierce
onslaughts
but
one
evening
a
change
came
over
the
spirit
of
the
sufferers
vision
there
had
been
a
somewhat
longer
interval
between
the
paroxysms
sir
adrian
seated
as
usual
by
the
bed
waiting
now
with
a
sinking
heart
for
the
wonted
return
of
the
frenzy
clamouring
in
his
soul
to
heaven
for
pity
on
one
whom
seemingly
no
human
aid
could
succour
dared
yet
draw
no
shadow
of
hope
from
the
more
prolonged
stillness
of
the
patient
presently
indeed
she
grew
restless
tossed
her
arms
muttered
with
parched
lips
then
she
suddenly
sat
up
and
listened
as
if
to
some
deeply
annoying
and
disquieting
sound
fell
back
again
under
his
gentle
hands
rolling
her
little
black
head
wearily
from
side
to
side
only
however
to
start
again
and
again
listen
thus
it
went
on
for
a
while
until
the
haunted
weary
eyes
grew
suddenly
distraught
with
terror
and
loathing
straining
them
into
space
as
if
seeking
something
she
ought
to
see
but
could
not
she
began
to
speak
in
a
quick
yet
distinct
whisper
how
it
creaks
creakscreaks
will
no
one
stop
that
creaking
what
is
it
that
creaks
so
will
no
one
stop
that
creaking
and
again
she
placed
her
cheek
on
the
pillow
covering
her
ear
with
her
little
wasted
hand
and
for
a
while
remained
motionless
moaning
like
a
child
but
it
was
only
to
spring
up
again
this
time
with
a
cry
which
brought
the
physician
from
the
adjacent
sleeping
room
in
alarm
to
her
bedside
ah
god
she
shrieked
her
eyes
distended
and
staring
as
if
into
the
far
distance
through
walls
and
outlying
darkness
i
see
it
they
have
done
it
they
have
done
it
it
is
hanging
on
the
sandshow
it
creaks
and
sways
in
the
wind
it
will
creak
for
ever
for
ever
now
it
spins
round
it
looks
this
waythe
black
face
it
looks
at
me
she
gave
another
piercing
cry
then
her
frame
grew
rigid
with
mouth
open
and
fixed
eyeballs
she
seemed
lost
in
the
frightful
fascination
of
the
image
before
her
brain
as
distracted
by
the
sight
of
her
torments
adrian
hung
over
her
racking
his
mind
in
the
endeavour
to
soothe
her
her
words
struck
a
chill
into
his
very
soul
he
cast
a
terrified
glance
at
the
doctor
who
was
ominously
feeling
her
pulse
there
is
a
change
he
faltered
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
told
you
before
he
retorted
irritably
that
you
should
attach
no
more
importance
to
the
substance
of
these
delirious
wanderings
than
you
would
to
the
ravings
of
madness
it
is
the
fact
of
the
delirium
itself
which
must
alarm
us
she
is
less
and
less
able
to
bear
it
the
patient
moaned
and
shuddered
resisting
the
gentle
force
that
would
have
pressed
her
down
on
her
pillow
oh
the
creaking
the
creaking
will
no
one
stop
that
creaking
must
i
hear
it
go
on
creak
creak
creak
for
ever
and
see
it
sway
and
sway
will
no
one
ever
stop
it
sir
adrian
took
a
sudden
resolution
i
will
he
said
low
and
clear
into
her
ear
she
sank
down
on
the
instant
and
looked
at
him
back
from
her
far
distance
almost
as
if
she
understood
him
and
the
pitiful
cry
for
the
help
he
would
have
given
his
hearts
blood
to
procure
for
her
was
silent
for
the
moment
upon
her
lips
i
will
prepare
an
opiate
said
the
physician
in
a
whisper
and
i
said
sir
adrian
to
him
with
a
strange
expression
upon
his
pale
face
am
going
to
stop
that
creaking
the
man
of
medicine
gazed
after
him
with
a
look
of
intense
astonishment
which
rapidly
changed
to
one
of
professional
interest
it
is
evident
that
i
shall
soon
have
another
mentally
deranged
patient
to
see
to

remarked
to
himself
as
he
rose
to
seek
the
drugs
he
meant
to
administer

sir
adrian
immediately
called
for
ren
and
being
informed
that
he
had
left
for
the
island
early
in
the
afternoon
and
had
announced
his
return
before
night
cast
a
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
hurried
forth
in
the
hope
of
meeting
him
upon
his
homeward
way
his
pulses
were
beating
wellnigh
as
wildly
as
those
of
the
fever
stricken
woman
upstairs
in
the
house
he
dared
not
pause
to
reflect
on
his
purpose
or
seek
to
disentangle
the
confusion
of
his
thoughts
for
fear
of
being
confronted
with
the
hopelessness
of
their
folly
but
the
exquisite
serenity
of
the
night
sky
where
swam
the
moon
a
silver
splendour
the
freshness
of
the
sweeping
breeze
that
dashed
keen
from
the
east
over
the
sea
against
his
face
all
the
glorious
distance
the
unconsciousness
and
detachment
of
nature
from
the
fume
and
misery
of
life
brought
him
unwittingly
to
a
calmer
mood
he
had
reached
the
extreme
confine
of
the
pine
wood
when
across
the
sands
that
stretched
unbroken
to
the
lips
of
the
sea
a
figure
advanced
towards
him
renny
called
sir
adrian
your
honour
cried
the
man
breaking
into
a
run
to
meet
him
o
god
how
ghostly
white
looked
the
masters
face
in
the
moonflood
my
lady
not
worse
yet
not
betterand
that
means
worse
now
but
there
is
a
change
renny
sinking
his
voice
and
clasping
the
mans
sturdy
arm
with
clammy
hand
is
it
true
they
have
placed
him
on
the
sands
today
the
man
stared
how
did
your
honour
know
yesthey
have
done
so
it
is
true
the
swine
not
more
than
an
hour
in
verity
how
could
it
have
come
so
soon
to
your
honours
ears
this
morning
indeed
they
came
from
the
town
in
a
cart
and
planted
the
great
gibbet
on
scarthey
point
at
low
water
and
tonight
they
brought
the
body
all
bound
in
irons
and
from
a
boat
for
it
was
high
tide
they
riveted
it
on
the
chain
and
it
is
to
remain
for
ever
your
honourso
they
say
strange
murmured
sir
adrian
to
himself
gazing
seaward
with
awestruck
eyes
and
did
you
he
asked
hear
its
creaking
renny
as
it
swayed
in
the
wind
again
ren
cast
a
quick
glance
of
alarm
at
his
master
the
master
had
a
singular
manner
with
him
tonight
then
edging
closer
to
him
he
whispered
in
his
ear
they
say
it
is
to
hang
for
ever
there
is
a
warning
to
those
who
would
interfere
with
this
justice
of
theirs
but
your
honour
there
came
one
to
the
island
today
i
do
not
know
if
your
honour
knows
him
the
captains
second
on
that
vessel
of
misfortune
and
i
believe
your
honour
the
dawn
will
never
see
that
poor
black
body
hanging
over
yonder
like
a
scarecrow
to
spoil
our
view
this
man
this
brave
mariner
curwen
is
his
name
he
is
mad
furious
with
us
all
he
has
just
but
come
from
hearing
of
his
captains
fate
and
he
is
ready
to
kill
us
that
we
let
him
be
murdered
without
breaking
some
heads
for
him
faith
if
it
could
have
done
any
good
it
is
not
i
that
would
have
balanced
about
it
but
as
i
told
him
there
was
no
use
running
ones
own
head
into
a
loop
of
rope
when
that
would
please
nobody
but
mr
the
judge
but
he
is
not
to
be
reasoned
with
he
is
like
a
wild
animal
when
i
left
him
said
ren
dropping
his
voice
still
lower
he
was
knocking
a
coffin
together
out
of
the
old
sea
wood
on
scarthey
he
said
his
captain
would
rest
better
in
those
boards
that
were
seasoned
with
salt
water
and
when
i
went
away
your
honour
and
left
him
hammering
therefaith
i
thought
that
the
coffin
was
like
to
be
seasoned
by
another
kind
of
salt
water
too
his
face
twitched
and
the
ready
tears
sprang
to
his
own
eyes
which
unashamed
he
now
wiped
with
his
sleeve
after
his
custom
but
sir
adrians
mind
was
still
drifting
in
distant
ghastly
companionship
how
the
wind
blows
he
said
and
shuddered
a
little
how
the
poor
body
must
sway
in
the
wind
and
the
chains
creak
if
it
can
make
any
difference
to
the
poor
captain
he
will
lie
in
peace
tonight
please
god
said
ren
ay
said
sir
adrian
and
you
and
i
friend
will
go
too
and
help
this
good
fellow
in
his
task
i
hope
i
believe
that
i
should
have
done
this
thing
of
my
own
thought
had
i
had
time
to
think
at
all
but
now
more
hangs
upon
those
creaking
chains
than
you
can
dream
of
this
is
a
strange
worldand
it
is
full
of
ghosts
tonight
but
we
must
hurry
renny





bound
even
to
the
tips
of
her
burning
little
fingers
by
the
spell
of
the
opiate
lady
landale
lay
in
the
shadowed
room
as
one
dead
yet
in
her
sick
brain
fearfully
awake
keenly
alive
at
first
it
was
as
if
she
too
was
manacled
in
chains
till
she
could
not
move
a
muscle
could
not
breathe
or
cry
because
of
the
ring
round
her
breast
and
she
was
hanging
with
the
black
figure
swaying
while
the
rusty
iron
links
went
creak
creak
creak
with
every
swing
to
and
fro
then
suddenly
she
seemed
to
stand
as
it
were
out
of
herself
and
to
be
seeing
with
the
naked
soul
alone
and
what
she
saw
was
the
great
stretch
of
beach
and
sea
white
white
white
in
the
moonlight
and
spreading
it
seemed
for
leagues
and
leagues
spreading
till
all
the
world
was
only
beach
and
sea
but
close
to
her
in
the
whitest
moonlight
rose
the
great
gibbet
gaunt
and
black
cutting
the
pale
sky
in
two
and
athwart
and
hanging
from
it
was
the
black
figure
that
swayed
and
swung
and
though
the
winds
muttered
and
the
waves
growled
she
could
not
hear
them
with
the
ears
of
the
soul
for
that
the
whole
of
this
great
world
of
sea
and
sand
was
filled
with
the
creaking
of
the
chains
but
now
across
the
bleak
and
pallid
spaces
came
three
black
figures
and
as
she
looked
and
watched
and
they
drew
nearer
the
dreadful
burthen
of
the
gibbet
swung
round
as
if
to
greet
them
and
she
too
felt
in
her
soul
that
she
knew
them
all
three
though
not
by
names
as
creatures
of
earth
know
each
other
but
by
the
kinship
of
the
soul
this
man
with
hair
as
white
as
the
white
beach
hair
that
seemed
to
shine
silver
as
he
came
and
him
yonder
who
followed
him
as
a
dog
his
master
and
yonder
again
the
third
in
the
seamans
dress
with
hard
face
hewn
into
such
rugged
lines
of
grief
and
furyshe
knew
them
all
and
next
they
reached
the
gibbet
and
one
swarmed
up
the
black
post
and
hammered
and
filed
and
prised
and
then
oh
merciful
god
the
creaking
stopped
at
last
now
she
could
hear
the
wash
of
the
waves
the
rush
of
the
wholesome
wind
a
mist
came
across
her
vision
faintly
she
saw
the
stiffened
disfigured
corpse
which
yet
she
felt
had
once
been
something
she
had
loved
with
passion
laid
reverently
upon
a
stretcher
its
irons
loosened
and
cast
away
and
then
covered
with
a
great
cloak
then
the
sea
the
beach
the
white
moon
faded
and
waved
and
receded
mollys
soul
went
back
to
her
body
again
while
blessed
tears
fell
one
by
one
from
her
hot
eyes
she
breathed
her
limbs
relaxed
round
the
tired
brain
came
with
a
soft
hush
like
that
of
gentle
wings
dark
oblivion
bending
over
her
for
he
was
aware
that
for
good
or
evil
the
crisis
was
at
hand
the
physician
saw
moisture
bead
upon
the
suddenly
smoothed
brow
heard
a
deep
sigh
escape
the
parted
lips
and
then
with
a
movement
like
a
weary
childs
she
drew
her
arms
close
and
fell
asleep





having
laid
his
friend
to
his
secret
rest
deep
in
the
rock
of
scarthey
where
the
free
waves
that
his
soul
had
revelled
in
would
beat
till
the
worlds
end
sir
adrian
returned
to
pulwick
in
the
early
morning
spent
with
the
long
and
heavy
nights
toilfor
it
had
taxed
the
strength
of
even
three
men
to
hollow
out
a
grave
in
such
a
soil
on
the
threshold
he
was
greeted
by
the
physician
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
the
messengers
of
glad
tidings
from
afar
by
the
mans
demeanour
he
knew
that
the
tidings
were
glad
and
most
blessed
they
were
indeed
to
his
ears
but
to
them
alone
not
strange
throughout
every
detail
of
his
errand
his
mind
had
dwelt
rather
with
the
living
than
the
dead
what
he
had
done
he
had
done
for
her
and
now
the
task
achieved
it
seemed
but
natural
that
the
object
for
which
it
had
been
undertaken
should
have
been
achieved
likewise
but
left
once
more
with
her
seeing
her
once
more
wrapt
in
placid
sleep
whom
he
had
thought
he
would
never
behold
at
rest
again
save
in
the
last
sleep
of
all
the
revulsion
was
overpowering
he
sat
down
by
her
side
and
through
his
tears
gazed
long
at
the
lovely
head
now
in
its
pallor
and
emaciation
so
sadly
like
that
of
his
dead
love
in
the
sorrowful
days
of
youth
and
he
thanked
heaven
that
he
was
still
of
the
earth
to
shield
her
with
his
devotion
to
cherish
her
who
was
now
so
helpless
and
bereft
and
with
such
tears
and
such
thoughts
came
a
forgetfulness
of
that
anguish
which
in
him
as
well
as
in
her
had
for
so
long
been
part
of
actual
existence
when
tanty
entered
on
tiptoe
some
hours
later
she
saw
her
niece
motionless
upon
her
pillow
sleeping
as
easily
and
reposefully
as
a
child
and
close
to
her
head
sir
adrian
reclining
in
the
armchair
asleep
likewise
his
arm
was
stretched
limply
over
the
bed
and
on
its
sleeve
still
stained
with
the
red
mud
of
the
grave
in
scarthey
rested
lady
landales
little
thin
ivorywhite
fingers





thus
ended
mollys
brief
but
terrible
madness
then
you
have
hope
real
hope
asked
sir
adrian
of
the
physician
as
they
met
again
that
day
in
the
gallery
every
hope
replied
the
man
of
science
with
the
proud
consciousness
of
having
by
his
wisdom
pulled
his
patient
out
of
the
very
jaws
of
death
recovery
is
now
but
a
question
of
a
time
of
a
long
time
of
course
for
this
crisis
has
left
her
weaker
than
the
newborn
babe
repose
complete
repose
sleep
that
is
almost
everything
and
she
will
sleep
happily
as
usual
in
such
cases
lady
landale
seems
to
have
lost
all
memory
but
i
must
impress
upon
you
sir
adrian
that
the
longer
we
can
keep
her
in
this
state
the
better
if
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
even
the
sight
of
you
might
recall
distressing
impressions
you
must
let
me
request
of
you
to
keep
away
from
the
sick
room
till
your
wifes
strength
be
sufficiently
restored
to
be
able
to
face
emotions
this
was
said
with
a
certain
significance
which
called
the
colour
to
sir
adrians
cheek
he
acquiesced
however
without
hesitation
and
banished
from
the
place
where
his
treasure
lay
fell
to
haunting
the
passages
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
to
waylaying
the
privileged
attendants
with
a
humble
resignation
which
would
have
been
sorrowful
but
for
the
savour
of
his
recent
relief
from
anguish
but
the
next
morning
lady
landale
though
too
weak
of
body
to
lift
a
finger
too
weak
of
mind
to
connect
a
single
coherent
phrase
nevertheless
took
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
and
proved
that
it
is
as
easy
to
err
upon
the
side
of
prudence
as
upon
its
reverse
miss
odonoghue
emerging
silently
from
the
room
after
her
nights
vigil
came
upon
her
nephew
at
his
post
and
struck
to
her
kind
heart
by
his
wistful
countenance
bade
him
with
many
winks
and
nods
enter
and
have
a
look
at
his
wife
dont
make
a
sound
she
whispered
to
him
and
then
she
wont
hear
you
but
faith
shes
sleeping
so
well
its
my
belief
if
you
danced
a
jig
she
would
not
stir
a
limb
go
in
child
go
in
its
beautiful
to
see
her
and
adrian
pressed
by
his
own
longing
was
unable
to
resist
the
offer
noiselessly
he
stepped
across
the
forbidden
threshold
and
stood
for
a
long
time
contemplating
the
sleeper
in
the
dim
light
as
he
was
about
to
creep
out
at
length
she
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
wonderingly
upon
him
fearful
of
having
done
the
cruel
deed
against
which
he
had
been
warned
he
felt
his
heart
contract
and
would
have
rushed
away
in
an
agony
of
selfaccusation
when
there
occurred
what
seemed
to
him
a
miracle
a
faint
smile
came
upon
the
pale
lips
and
narrowed
ever
so
little
the
large
sunken
eyes
yes
by
all
that
was
beautiful
it
was
a
smiletransient
and
piteous
but
a
smile
and
for
him
as
he
bent
forward
almost
incapable
of
believing
the
lips
relaxed
again
and
the
lids
drooped
but
she
shifted
her
hands
upon
the
bed
uneasily
as
if
seeking
something
he
knelt
trembling
by
her
side
and
as
with
diffident
fingers
he
clasped
the
wandering
hands
he
felt
them
faintly
cling
to
his
and
his
heart
melted
all
in
joy
the
man
of
science
had
reasoned
astray
there
need
be
no
separation
between
the
husband
who
would
so
dearly
console
and
the
wife
who
needed
help
so
sorely
for
a
long
while
he
remained
thus
kneeling
and
holding
her
hands
it
seemed
as
though
some
of
the
life
strength
he
longed
to
be
able
to
pour
from
himself
to
her
actually
passed
into
her
frame
as
though
there
were
indeed
a
healing
virtue
in
his
all
encompassing
tenderness
for
after
a
while
a
faint
colour
came
to
the
sunken
cheeks
and
presently
still
holding
his
hand
she
fell
once
more
into
that
slumber
which
was
now
her
healing
after
this
it
was
found
that
the
patient
actually
became
fretful
and
fevered
again
when
her
husband
was
too
long
absent
from
her
side
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
supersede
all
other
watchers
in
her
room
tanty
in
highest
good
humour
declared
that
her
services
were
no
longer
necessary
and
volunteered
to
conduct
madeleine
to
the
jersey
convent
whither
her
decision
being
irrevocable
it
was
generally
felt
that
it
would
be
well
for
the
latter
to
proceed
before
her
sisters
memory
with
returning
strength
should
have
returned
likewise
this
memory
without
which
the
being
he
loved
would
remain
afflicted
and
incomplete
yet
upon
the
working
of
which
so
much
that
was
still
uncertain
must
hingesir
adrian
at
once
yearned
for
and
dreaded
it
many
a
time
as
he
met
the
sweet
and
joyful
greeting
in
those
eyes
where
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
find
nought
but
either
mockery
or
disdain
did
he
recall
his
friends
prophetic
words
out
of
my
death
will
grow
your
happiness
was
there
happiness
indeed
yet
in
store
in
the
future
alas
happiness
for
them
dwelt
in
oblivion
and
some
day
remembrance
would
wake
with
all
her
busy
train
and
swell
at
her
breast
and
then
meanwhile
however
the
present
had
a
sweetness
of
its
own
there
was
now
free
scope
for
the
passion
of
devotedness
which
almost
made
up
the
sum
of
this
mans
charactera
character
which
to
the
molly
of
wayward
days
to
the
hotpulsed
eager
impatient
murthering
moll
had
been
utterly
incomprehensible
and
uncongenial
and
to
the
molly
crushed
in
the
direst
battle
of
life
whom
one
more
harshness
of
fate
even
the
slightest
would
have
straightaway
hurled
back
into
the
grave
that
had
barely
been
baulked
of
its
prey
it
gave
the
very
food
and
breath
of
her
new
existence
week
after
week
passed
in
this
guise
during
which
her
natural
healthiness
slowly
but
surely
reestablished
itself
weeks
that
were
happy
to
him
in
later
life
to
look
back
upon
though
now
full
of
an
anxiousness
which
waxed
stronger
as
recovery
drew
nearer
there
was
little
talking
between
them
and
that
kept
by
him
studiously
on
subjects
of
purely
ephemeral
childish
interest
her
mind
by
the
happy
dispensation
of
nature
which
facilitates
healing
by
all
means
when
once
healing
has
begun
was
blank
to
any
impressions
save
the
luxury
of
rest
of
passive
enjoyment
indifferent
to
ought
but
the
passing
present
she
took
pleasure
in
flowers
in
the
gambols
of
pet
animals
in
long
listless
spells
of
cloudgazing
when
the
heavens
were
bright
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
in
whom
she
only
saw
a
being
whose
eyes
were
always
beautiful
with
the
light
of
kindness
whose
touch
invariably
soothed
her
when
fatigue
or
irritation
marred
the
even
course
of
her
feelings
she
had
ever
a
smile
for
him
which
entered
his
soul
like
the
radiance
of
sunshine
through
a
stormy
sky
thus
the
days
went
by
like
a
child
she
ate
and
slept
and
chatteredirresponsible
chatter
that
was
music
to
his
ear
she
laughed
and
teased
him
too
as
a
child
would
till
sad
as
it
was
he
hugged
the
incomplete
happiness
to
his
heart
with
a
dire
foreboding
that
it
might
be
all
he
was
to
know
in
life
but
one
evening
in
sudden
freak
she
bade
him
open
the
shutters
pull
the
curtains
and
raise
the
window
that
she
might
from
her
pillow
look
forth
upon
the
night
and
smell
the
sweet
night
air
she
had
been
unusually
well
that
day
and
on
her
face
now
filling
out
once
more
into
its
old
soft
oval
bloomed
again
a
look
of
warm
life
and
youth
unsuspecting
unthinking
sir
adrian
obeyed
it
was
a
dim
close
night
and
the
blushroses
nodded
palely
into
the
room
from
the
outer
darkness
as
he
raised
the
sash
there
was
no
moon
no
stars
shone
in
the
mist
hung
sky
there
was
no
light
to
be
seen
anywhere
except
one
faint
glimmer
in
the
distancethe
light
upon
scarthey
island
is
that
a
star
said
molly
after
a
moments
dreamy
silence
sir
adrian
started
a
vision
of
all
that
might
hang
upon
his
answer
flashed
through
his
brain
with
a
trembling
hand
he
pulled
the
curtain
it
was
too
late
molly
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
contracted
brow
and
hands
outstretched
as
one
who
would
seize
a
tantalising
escaping
memory
i
used
to
watch
it
then
at
night
from
this
window
she
whispered
what
was
it
the
light
of
scarthey
then
suddenly
with
a
scream
the
light
of
scarthey
adrian
sprang
to
her
side
but
she
turned
from
him
shrank
from
him
with
a
look
of
dread
which
seared
him
to
the
soul
do
not
come
near
me
do
not
touch
me
she
cried
and
then
he
left
her





miss
odonoghue
was
gone
upon
her
journey
with
madeleine
there
was
none
in
whom
he
might
confide
with
whom
seek
counsel
but
presently
listening
outside
the
door
in
an
agony
of
suspense
he
heard
a
storm
of
sobs
in
time
these
gradually
subsided
and
later
he
learnt
from
moggie
whom
he
had
hurriedly
ordered
to
her
mistresss
side
that
his
wife
was
quiet
and
seemed
inclined
to
rest
on
the
next
day
she
expressed
no
desire
to
see
him
and
he
dared
not
go
to
her
unsought
he
gathered
a
great
dewy
bunch
of
roses
and
had
them
brought
to
her
upon
her
breakfast
tray
instead
of
bringing
them
himself
as
had
been
his
wont
she
had
taken
the
roses
moggie
told
him
and
laid
them
to
her
cheek
the
master
sent
them
said
i
continued
the
sturdy
little
matron
who
was
far
from
possessing
the
instinctive
tact
of
her
spouse
an
she
get
agate
ocrying
quiet
like
and
let
the
flowers
fall
out
of
her
hands
on
the
bedeh
what
evers
coom
to
her
sin
yesterday
wannut
you
go
in
sir
not
unless
she
sends
for
me
said
sir
adrian
hastily
and
remember
moggie
do
not
speak
my
name
to
her
she
must
not
be
worried
or
distressed
but
if
she
sends
for
me
come
at
once
you
will
find
me
in
the
library
and
in
the
library
he
sat
the
long
long
day
waiting
for
the
summons
that
did
not
come
she
never
sent
for
him
she
had
wept
a
good
deal
during
the
day
the
faithful
reporter
told
him
in
the
evening
but
always
quiet
like
had
spoken
little
and
though
of
unwonted
gentleness
of
manner
had
persistently
declined
to
be
carried
to
the
garden
as
usual
or
even
to
leave
her
room
now
she
had
gone
back
to
bed
and
was
sleeping
peacefully
an
hour
later
sir
adrian
left
his
home
for
scarthey
once
again
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
his
existence
he
ever
carried
into
the
sheltering
ruins
a
heart
more
full
of
cruel
pain
when
tanty
returned
to
pulwick
from
her
travels
again
it
was
to
find
in
miss
landale
the
only
member
of
the
family
waiting
to
greet
her
the
old
ladys
displeasure
on
learning
the
reason
of
this
defection
was
at
first
too
intense
to
find
relief
in
words
but
presently
the
strings
of
her
tongue
were
loosened
under
the
influence
of
the
usual
feminine
restorative
and
failing
a
better
listener
she
began
to
dilate
upon
the
situation
with
her
wonted
garrulity
yes
my
good
sophia
i
will
thank
you
for
another
cup
of
tea
what
should
we
do
without
tea
in
this
weary
world
i
declare
its
the
only
pleasure
left
to
me
nowfor
of
all
the
ungrateful
things
in
life
working
for
your
posterity
is
the
most
ungrateful
posterity
is
born
to
trample
on
one
and
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
exactly
how
matters
stand
my
niece
is
greatly
better
i
hear
the
doctor
considers
her
quite
convalescent
at
least
this
is
very
satisfactory
very
satisfactory
indeed
just
now
she
is
resting
quite
so
i
should
not
dream
of
disturbing
her
more
especially
as
the
sight
of
me
would
probably
revive
painful
memories
and
we
must
not
risk
her
having
a
bad
nightof
course
not
ah
my
dear
memory
like
ones
teeth
is
a
very
doubtful
blessing
far
more
trouble
than
pleasure
when
you
have
it
and
yet
a
dreadful
nuisance
when
you
have
notbut
whats
this
i
hear
about
adrian
gone
back
to
that
detestable
island
of
his
again
i
left
him
and
molly
smiling
into
each
others
eyes
clasping
each
others
hands
like
two
turtledoves
why
she
could
not
as
much
as
swallow
a
mouthful
of
soup
unless
he
was
beside
her
to
feed
herand
now
i
am
told
he
has
not
been
near
her
for
four
days
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
oh
dont
talk
to
me
sophia
its
more
than
flesh
and
blood
can
bear
here
am
i
having
been
backward
and
forward
over
nine
hundred
miles
looking
after
you
all
at
my
age
till
i
dont
know
which
it
is
lancashire
or
somerset
im
in
or
whether
im
on
my
head
or
my
heels
though
im
sure
i
can
count
every
bone
of
my
body
by
the
aching
of
themand
i
did
think
i
was
coming
back
to
a
little
peace
and
comfort
at
length
that
island
of
his
sophia
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
wish
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
that
is
the
only
thing
that
will
bring
your
brother
to
his
senses
i
believe
now
he
might
as
well
be
in
his
grave
at
once
like
rupert
for
all
the
good
he
is
though
for
that
matter
its
more
harm
than
good
poor
rupert
ever
did
while
he
was
alive
excuse
me
aunt
rose
here
exclaimed
sophia
heroically
her
corkscrew
ringlets
trembling
with
agitation
but
i
must
beg
you
to
refrain
from
such
remarksi
cannot
hear
my
dear
brother
but
miss
odonoghue
waved
the
interruption
peremptorily
away
now
its
no
use
your
going
on
sophia
we
dont
think
a
man
flies
straight
to
heaven
just
because
hes
dead
and
nothing
will
ever
make
me
approve
of
ruperts
conduct
in
all
this
dreadful
business
of
course
one
must
not
speak
evil
of
those
who
cant
defend
themselves
but
for
all
that
he
is
dead
and
buried
rupert
might
argue
with
me
from
now
till

that
it
is
the
part
of
a
gentleman
to
act

i
hope
my
dear
he
has
found
more
mercy
than
he
gave
i
hope
so
but
only
for
him
my
poor
dear
grandniece
molly
would
never
have
gone
off
on
that
mad
journey
and
my
poor
grandniece
madeleine
would
not
be
buried
alive
on
that
other
island
at
the
back
of
gods
speed
ah
yes
my
dear
it
has
been
a
very
sad
time
i
declare
i
felt
all
the
while
as
if
i
were
conducting
a
corpse
to
be
buried
and
now
i
feel
as
if
i
had
come
back
from
the
dear
girls
funeral
we
had
a
dreadful
passage
and
she
was
so
sick
that
im
afraid
even
if
she
wanted
to
come
out
of
that
place
again
shed
never
have
the
courage
to
face
the
crossing
she
was
a
wrecka
perfect
wreck
when
she
reached
the
convent
many
a
time
i
thought
she
would
only
land
to
find
herself
dead
i
wanted
her
to
come
to
the
hotel
with
me
where
i
should
have
popped
her
into
bed
with
a
hot
bottle
but
nothing
would
serve
her
but
that
she
must
go
to
the
convent
at
once
i
shall
not
be
able
to
rest
till
i
am
there
she
said
and
its
precious
little
rest
you
will
get
there
said
i
if
its
rest
you
wantwhat
with
the
hard
beds
and
all
the
prayers
you
have
to
say
and
the
popping
out
of
bed
as
soon
as
you
are
asleep
to
sing
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
those
blessed
little
bells
going
every
three
minutes
and
a
half
there
is
no
rest
in
a
convent
my
dear
but
i
might
as
well
have
talked
to
the
wall
when
i
went
to
see
her
the
next
day
true
enough
she
declared
that
she
was
more
content
already
and
that
her
soul
had
found
what
it
yearned
forpeace
she
was
quite
calm
and
sent
you
all
messages
to
say
how
she
would
pray
for
you
and
for
the
repose
of
the
souls

would

there
there
we
wont

the

any

poor

so
i
left
her
i
declare
i
never
liked
her
so
much
as
when
i
said
goodbye
for
i
felt
id
never
see
her
again

thus
you

mine

was
an
heiress

chose
the

they

charges
i
also
am
entitled
to
bear
as
you
know
or
rather
dont
know
i
presume
for
you
have
all
the
haziest
notion
of
what
sort
of
blood
it
is
that
runs
in

i

she
tried

me
in
her
pious
way
oh
it
was
very
beautiful
of
coursebride
of
heaven
and
the
rest
of
it
but
i
had
rather
seen
her
the
bride
of
a
nice
young
man
many
is
the
time
i
have
wished
i
had
not
been
so
hasty
about
that
poor
young
smith
i
dont
believe
he
was
purely
smith
after
all
he
must
have
had
some
good
blood
in
his
veins
oh
of
course
of
course
he
was
dreadfully
wicked
i
know
but
he
was
a
fine
fellow
and
all
these
complications
would
have
been
avoided
but
after
all
it
was
ruperts
fault
if
everything
ended
in
tragedy

it
was
on
the
fifth
day
after
sir
adrians
return
to
his
island
home
outwardly
the
place
was
the
same
a
man
had
been
engaged
to
attend
to
the
lighthouse
duties
but
he
and
his
wife
lived
apart
in
their
own
corner
of
the
building
and
never
intruded
into
the
masters
apartments
or
into
the
turretroom
which
had
been
captain
jacks
from
the
moment
that
sir
adrian
attended
by
ren
had
reentered
the
old
rooms
the
peel
had
resumed
its
wonted
aspect
but
the
peace
the
serenity
which
belonged
to
it
for
so
many
years
had
fledfled
it
seemed
to
sir
adrian
for
ever
still
there
was
solitude
and
in
so
far
repose
it
was
something
to
have
such
a
haven
of
refuge
for
his
bruised
spirit
the
whole
morning
of
this
day
had
been
spent
in
counting
out
and
securing
in
separate
lots
duly
docketted
and
distinguished
a
portion
of
that
unwieldy
accumulation
of
wealth
the
charge
of
which
he
had
accepted
against
the
time
when
it
should
be
called
for
and
claimed
by
its
depositors
the
task
was
by
no
means
simple
and
required
all
his
attention
but
there
is
a
blessing
even
in
mere
mechanical
labour
that
soothes
the
torment
of
the
mind
in
the
particular
occupation
upon
which
he
had
been
engaged
there
was
moreover
a
hidden
touching
element
it
was
work
for
the
helpless
dead
work
for
that
erring
man
but
noble
soul
who
had
been
his
loyal
friend
as
sir
adrian
tied
up
each
bag
of
gold
and
labelled
it
with
the
name
of
some
unknown
creditor
who
had
trusted
jack
dimly
the
thought
occurred
that
it
would
stand
material
proof
call
for
recognition
that
this
captain
smith
who
had
died
the
death
of
a
felon
had
been
a
true
man
even
in
his
own
chosen
lawless
path
on
the
table
amid
the
papers
and
books
a
heap
of
gold
pieces
yet
untold
remainder
of
his
allotted
days
task
awaited
still
his
ministering
hand
but
he
was
tired
it
was
the
dreamy
hour
of
the
day
when
the
shadows
grow
long
the
shafts
of
light
level
and
sir
adrian
sat
at
his
open
window
gazing
at
the
distant
view
of
pulwick
while
his
thoughts
wandered
into
the
future
immediate
and
distant
with
the
selfdetachment
of
his
nature
these
thoughts
all
bore
upon
the
future
of
the
woman
whom
he
pictured
to
himself
lying
behind
those
sunlit
windows
yonder
framed
by
the
verdure
of
leafy
june
gathering
slowly
back
her
broken
strength
for
the
long
life
stretching
before
her
unlike
the
musings
which
in
the
lonely
days
of
old
had
ever
drifted
irresistibly
towards
the
past
and
gathered
round
the
image
of
the
dead
all
the
power
of
his
mind
was
now
fixed
upon
what
was
to
come
upon
the
child
still
dearer
than
the
mother
who
had
all
her
life
to
live
what
would
she
do
what
could
he
do
for
her
now
that
she
required
his
helping
hand
no
more
life
was
full
of
sorrow
past
and
present
and
in
the
future
there
lurked
no
promise
of
better
things
the
mind
of
man
is
always
fain
even
in
its
darkest
hour
to
take
flight
into
some
distant
realm
of
hope
to
those
whom
life
has
utterly
betrayed
there
is
always
the
hope
of
approaching
deathbut
this
even
reason
denied
to
him
he
was
so
strong
illness
had
never
taken
hold
of
him
he
came
from
such
longlived
stock
he
might
almost
outlive
her
might
for
ever
stand
as
the
one
ineluctable
check
upon
her
peace
of
mind
and
his
melancholy
reflections
came
circling
back
to
their
first
startingpointthat
barren
rock
of
misery
in
a
vast
sea
of
despondencythere
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
barriers
raised
between
them
on
his
side
partly
by
the
poisonous
words
of
his
brother
partly
by
the
phantom
of
that
old
love
of
which
the
new
had
at
first
been
but
an
eluding
reflex
and
on
hers
by
the
chilly
disillusion
which
had
fallen
so
soon
upon
her
ardent
nature
these
sank
into
insignificance
contrasted
to
the
whirl
of
baulked
passion
which
had
passed
over
her
life
to
leave
it
utterly
blasted
to
turn
her
indifference
to
hate
yes
that
was
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
she
hated
and
dreaded
him
his
love
his
forbearance
his
chivalrousness
had
been
in
vain
all
he
had
now
to
live
upon
was
the
memory
of
those
few
days
when
under
the
spell
of
oblivion
the
beloved
child
had
smiled
on
him
in
the
unconscious
love
born
of
her
helplessness
and
his
care
but
even
this
most
precious
remembrance
of
the
present
was
now
like
that
of
the
past
to
be
obscured
by
its
abrupt
and
terrible
end
death
had
given
birth
to
the
first
and
last
avowal
of
love
in
her
who
had
perished
between
his
arms
under
the
swirling
waters
of
the
vilainebut
it
was
life
itself
returning
life
and
health
of
mind
which
had
changed
looks
of
trust
and
affection
into
the
chilly
stare
of
dread
in
the
eyes
of
her
whom
with
all
the
strength
of
his
hoarded
manhood
he
now
loved
alone
the
past
for
all
its
sorrows
had
held
sweetness
the
present
the
future
nothing
but
torment
and
now
even
the
past
with
its
love
and
its
sorrow
was
gone
from
him
merged
in
the
greater
love
and
sorrow
of
the
present
how
long
could
he
bear
ituseless
clamour
of
the
soul
he
must
bear
it
life
must
be
accepted
sir
adrian
rose
and
standing
paused
a
moment
to
let
his
sight
wandering
beyond
the
immense
sands
seek
repose
for
a
moment
in
the
blue
haze
marking
the
horizon
of
the
hills
the
day
was
pure
exquisite
in
its
waning
beauty
the
breeze
as
light
and
soft
as
a
caress
in
the
great
stillness
of
the
bay
the
sisters
sea
and
land
talked
in
gentle
intermittent
murmurs
now
and
then
the
cries
of
circling
seafowl
brought
a
note
of
uncanny
joy
into
the
harmony
that
seemed
like
silence
in
its
unity
a
beautiful
harmonious
world
but
to
him
the
very
sense
of
the
outer
peace
gave
a
fresh
emphasis
to
the
discordance
of
his
own
life
he
brought
his
gaze
from
afar
and
slowly
turned
to
resume
his
work
but
even
as
he
turned
a
black
speck
upon
the
nearer
arm
of
sea
challenged
his
fleeting
attention
he
stood
and
watchedand
as
he
watched
a
sensation
the
most
poignant
and
yet
eerie
he
had
ever
known
clutched
him
by
the
heart
a
boat
was
approaching
a
small
rowboat
in
which
the
oars
were
plyed
by
a
woman
by
the
multicoloured

he
knew
her
but
without
attaching
name
or
personality
to
his
recognition
for
all
his
being
was
drawn
to
the
something
that
lay
huddled
black
and
motionless
in
the
stern
he
felt
to
the
innermost
fibre
of
him
that
this
something
was
a
woman
toothis
woman
molly
but
the
conviction
seized
him
with
a
force
that
was
beyond
surprise
and
all
the
vital
heat
in
him
fled
to
his
heart
leaving
him
deadly
cold
as
her
face
grew
out
of
the
distance
towards
him
a
minute
white
patch
amid
the
dark
cloud
of
silk
and
lace
that
enwrapt
it
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
known
for
centuries
that
she
was
thus
to
come
to
him
and
the
glow
of
his
heart
spread
to
his
brain
when
the
boat
was
about
to
land
he
began
like
one
walking
in
his
sleep
to
move
away
and
slowly
descending
the
stairs
of
the
keep
he
advanced
towards
the
margin
of
the
sea
he
walked
slowly
for
the
body
was
heavy
whilst
the
soul
trembled
within
its
earthly
bounds
molly
had
alighted
and
was
toiling
with
her
new
born
and
yet
but
feeble
strength
upon
the
yielding
sand
supported
between
ren
and
moggie
she
halted
as
she
saw
him
approach
and
when
he
came
close
looked
up
into
his
face
her
frail
figure
wavered
and
bent
and
she
would
have
fallen
on
her
knees
before
him
but
that
he
opened
his
arms
wide
and
caught
her
to
him
an
exclamation
rose
to
moggies
lips
to
die
unformed
under
an
imperious
glance
from
ren
who
with
shining
eyes
and
set
mouth
had
stood
apart
to
watch
the
momentous
issue
adrian
felt
his
wife
nestle
to
him
as
he
held
her
and
then
the
tide
of
his
longbound
love
overflowed
and
gathering
her
up
in
his
arms
as
if
she
were
a
child
he
turned
to
carry
the
broken
woman
with
him
into
the
shelter
the
silence
of
the
ruins
at
the
foot
of
the
outer
wall
just
out
of
reach
of
high
water
yet
within
reach
of
its
salt
spray
a
little
mound
of
red
stony
soil
rose
very
slightly
above
the
green
turf
at
its
head
a
small
stone
cross
roughly
hewn
was
let
into
the
masonry
itself
the
grave
of
hubert
cochrane
was
not
obtrusive
in
a
few
months
it
would
have
merged
again
into
the
greensward
and
its
humble
memorial
symbol
would
be
covered
with
moss
and
lichen
like
the
matrix
of
stone
which
encompassed
it
involuntarily
as
he
passed
it
the
man
with
his
all
too
light
burden
halted
a
flame
shot
through
him
as
molly
turned
her
head
to
gaze
too
he
shook
with
a
brief
agony
of
jealousyjealousy
of
the
dead
the
next
instant
he
felt
her
recoil
look
up
pleadingly
and
cling
to
him
again
and
he
knew
into
the
soul
of
his
soul
that
the
words
spoken
by
those
loyal
lipsnow
clay
beneath
that
claywere
coming
true
that
out
of
his
house
laid
desolate
to
him
was
to
rise
a
new
and
stately
mansion
grasping
her
closer
he
hurried
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
old
room
where
he
had
first
seen
her
bright
young
beauty
at
the
door
he
gently
suffered
her
to
stand
still
supporting
her
with
one
arm
about
her
waist
as
they
entered
she
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
her
eyes
bedewed
with
rising
tears
fell
upon
the
heap
of
gold
glinting
under
the
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
and
she
understood
the
nature
of
the
task
her
coming
had
interrupted
her
tears
gushed
forth
catching
his
hand
between
hers
and
looking
up
at
him
with
a
strange
wonderful
humility
she
pressed
it
to
her
lips
what
need
for
words
between
them
then
he
stood
a
little
while
motionless
in
front
of
her
entranced
yet
still
almost
incredulous
as
one
suddenly
freed
from
long
intolerable
pain
when
there
rose
once
more
for
the
last
time
before
his
minds
eye
the
ideal
image
that
had
been
the
companion
of
twenty
years
of
his
existence
it
was
vivid
almost
as
life
he
saw
ccile
de
savenaye
bend
over
her
child
with
grave
and
tender
look
then
turn
and
smile
upon
him
with
the
old
exquisite
sweetness
that
he
had
adored
so
madly
in
that
far
off
past
and
then
it
was
as
if
she
had
merged
into
molly
behold
she
was
gone
there
was
no
ccile
only
molly
the
woman
he
loved
molly
whom
now
he
seized
to
his
heart
who
smiled
at
him
through
her
tears
as
he
bent
to
kiss
her
lips
twilight
was
waning
and
the
light
of
scarthey
beamed
peacefully
over
the
yellow
sands
and
the
waves
receded
dragging
away
sand
and
shingle
from
the
foot
of
the
hidden
grave
