you

project
gutenberg
has
been
involved
with
the
writings
of
both
the
alexandre
dumases
for
some
time
now
and
since
we
get
a
few
questions
about
the
order
in
which
the
books
should
be
read
and
in
which
they
were
published
these
following
comments
should
hopefully
help
most
of
our
readers

the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
is
the
final
volume
of
dartagnan
romances
it
is
usually
split
into
three
or
four
parts
and
the
final
portion
is
entitled
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
were
familiar
with
today
is
the
last
volume
of
the
fourvolume
edition
not
all
the
editions
split
them
in
the
same
manner
hence
some
of
the
confusionbut
waittheres
yet
more
reason
for
confusion
we
intend
to
do
all
of
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
split
into
four
etexts
entitled
the
vicomte

bragelonne
ten
years
later
louise
de
la
valliere
and
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
one
thing
that
may
be
causing
confusion
is
that
the
etext
we
have
now
entitled
ten
years
later
says
its
the
sequel
to
the
three
musketeers
while
this
is
technically
true
theres
another
book
twenty
years
after
that
comes
between
the
confusion
is
generated
by
the
two
facts
that
we
published
ten
years
later
before
we
published
twenty
years
after
and
that
many
people
see
those
titles
as
meaning
ten
and
twenty
years
after
the
original
storyhowever
this
is
why
the
different
words
after
and
laterthe
ten
years
after
is
ten
years
after
the
twenty
years
lateras
per
history
also
the
third
book
of
the
dartagnan
romances
while
entitled
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
has
the
subtitle
ten
years
later
these
two
titles
are
also
given
to
different
volumes
the
vicomte
de

can
refer
to
the

the

chapter
i
the
prisoner
since
aramiss
singular
transformation
into
a
confessor
of
the
order
baisemeaux
was
no
longer
the
same
man
up
to
that
period
the
place
which
aramis
had
held
in
the
worthy
governors
estimation
was
that
of
a
prelate
whom
he
respected
and
a
friend
to
whom
he
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
but
now
he
felt
himself
an
inferior
and
that
aramis
was
his
master
he
himself
lighted
a
lantern
summoned
a
turnkey
and
said
returning
to
aramis
i
am
at
your
orders
monseigneur
aramis
merely
nodded
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
very
good
and
signed
to
him
with
his
hand
to
lead
the
way
baisemeaux
advanced
and
aramis
followed
him
it
was
a
calm
and
lovely
starlit
night
the
steps
of
three
men
resounded
on
the
flags
of
the
terraces
and
the
clinking
of
the
keys
hanging
from
the
jailers
girdle
made
itself
heard
up
to
the
stories
of
the
towers
as
if
to
remind
the
prisoners
that
the
liberty
of
earth
was
a
luxury
beyond
their
reach
it
might
have
been
said
that
the
alteration
effected
in
baisemeaux
extended
even
to
the
prisoners
the
turnkey
the
same
who
on
aramiss
first
arrival
had
shown
himself
so
inquisitive
and
curious
was
now
not
only
silent
but
impassible
he
held
his
head
down
and
seemed
afraid
to
keep
his
ears
open
in
this
wise
they
reached
the
basement
of
the
bertaudiere
the
two
first
stories
of
which
were
mounted
silently
and
somewhat
slowly
for
baisemeaux
though
far
from
disobeying
was
far
from
exhibiting
any
eagerness
to
obey
on
arriving
at
the
door
baisemeaux
showed
a
disposition
to
enter
the
prisoners
chamber
but
aramis
stopping
him
on
the
threshold
said
the
rules
do
not
allow
the
governor
to
hear
the
prisoners
confession
baisemeaux
bowed
and
made
way
for
aramis
who
took
the
lantern
and
entered
and
then
signed
to
them
to
close
the
door
behind
him
for
an
instant
he
remained
standing
listening
whether
baisemeaux
and
the
turnkey
had
retired
but
as
soon
as
he
was
assured
by
the
sound
of
their
descending
footsteps
that
they
had
left
the
tower
he
put
the
lantern
on
the
table
and
gazed
around
on
a
bed
of
green
serge
similar
in
all
respect
to
the
other
beds
in
the
bastile
save
that
it
was
newer
and
under
curtains
halfdrawn
reposed
a
young
man
to
whom
we
have
already
once
before
introduced
aramis
according
to
custom
the
prisoner
was
without
a
light
at
the
hour
of
curfew
he
was
bound
to
extinguish
his
lamp
and
we
perceive
how
much
he
was
favored
in
being
allowed
to
keep
it
burning
even
till
then
near
the
bed
a
large
leathern
armchair
with
twisted
legs
sustained
his
clothes
a
little
tablewithout
pens
books
paper
or
inkstood
neglected
in
sadness
near
the
window
while
several
plates
still
unemptied
showed
that
the
prisoner
had
scarcely
touched
his
evening
meal
aramis
saw
that
the
young
man
was
stretched
upon
his
bed
his
face
half
concealed
by
his
arms
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
did
not
caused
any
change
of
position
either
he
was
waiting
in
expectation
or
was
asleep
aramis
lighted
the
candle
from
the
lantern
pushed
back
the
armchair
and
approached
the
bed
with
an
evident
mixture
of
interest
and
respect
the
young
man
raised
his
head
what
is
it
said
he
you
desired
a
confessor
replied
aramis
yes
because
you
were
ill
yes
very
ill
the
young
man
gave
aramis
a
piercing
glance
and
answered
i
thank
you
after
a
moments
silence
i
have
seen
you
before
he
continued
aramis
bowed
doubtless
the
scrutiny
the
prisoner
had
just
made
of
the
cold
crafty
and
imperious
character
stamped
upon
the
features
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
was
little
reassuring
to
one
in
his
situation
for
he
added
i
am
better
and
so
said
aramis
why
thenbeing
better
i
have
no
longer
the
same
need
of
a
confessor
i
think
not
even
of
the
haircloth
which
the
note
you
found
in
your
bread
informed
you
of
the
young
man
started
but
before
he
had
either
assented
or
denied
aramis
continued
not
even
of
the
ecclesiastic
from
whom
you
were
to
hear
an
important
revelation
if
it
be
so
said
the
young
man
sinking
again
on
his
pillow
it
is
different
i
am
listening
aramis
then
looked
at
him
more
closely
and
was
struck
with
the
easy
majesty
of
his
mien
one
which
can
never
be
acquired
unless
heaven
has
implanted
it
in
the
blood
or
heart
sit
down
monsieur
said
the
prisoner
aramis
bowed
and
obeyed
how
does
the
bastile
agree
with
you
asked
the
bishop
very
well
you
do
not
suffer
no
you
have
nothing
to
regret
nothing
not
even
your
liberty
what
do
you
call

monsieur
asked
the
prisoner
with
the
tone
of
a
man
who
is
preparing
for
a
struggle
i

was
difficult
to
tell

said
he
i

in
that

vase
two
roses
gathered
yesterday

in
the
bud
from
the
governors

this
morning
they
have
blown
and
spread
their
vermilion
chalice
beneath
my
gaze
with
every
opening
petal
they
unfold
the
treasures
of
their
perfumes

my

with
a

roses
even
among

these
are
beautiful

the
rose

surprise
if
flowers
constitute
liberty
sadly
resumed
the
captive
i
am
free
for
i
possess
them
but
the
air
cried
aramis
air
is
so
necessary
to
life
well
monsieur
returned
the
prisoner
draw
near
to
the
window
it
is
open
between
high
heaven
and
earth
the
wind
whirls
on
its
waftages
of
hail
and
lightning
exhales
its
torrid
mist
or
breathes
in
gentle
breezes
it
caresses
my
face
when
mounted
on
the
back
of
this
armchair
with
my
arm
around
the
bars
of
the
window
to
sustain
myself
i
fancy
i
am
swimming
the
wide
expanse
before
me
the
countenance
of
aramis
darkened
as
the
young
man
continued
light
i
have
what
is
better
than
light
i
have
the
sun
a
friend
who
comes
to
visit
me
every
day
without
the
permission
of
the
governor
or
the
jailers
company
he
comes
in
at
the
window
and
traces
in
my
room
a
square
the
shape
of
the
window
which
lights
up
the
hangings
of
my
bed
and
floods
the
very
floor
this
luminous
square
increases
from
ten
oclock
till
midday
and
decreases
from
one
till
three
slowly
as
if
having
hastened
to
my
presence
it
sorrowed
at
bidding
me
farewell
when
its
last
ray
disappears
i
have
enjoyed
its
presence
for
five
hours
is
not
that
sufficient
i
have
been
told
that
there
are
unhappy
beings
who
dig
in
quarries
and
laborers
who
toil
in
mines
who
never
behold
it
at
all
aramis
wiped
the
drops
from
his
brow
as
to
the
stars
which
are
so
delightful
to
view
continued
the
young
man
they
all
resemble
each
other
save
in
size
and
brilliancy
i
am
a
favored
mortal
for
if
you
had
not
lighted
that
candle
you
would
have
been
able
to
see
the
beautiful
stars
which
i
was
gazing
at
from
my
couch
before
your
arrival
whose
silvery
rays
were
stealing
through
my
brain
aramis
lowered
his
head
he
felt
himself
overwhelmed
with
the
bitter
flow
of
that
sinister
philosophy
which
is
the
religion
of
the
captive
so
much
then
for
the
flowers
the
air
the
daylight
and
the
stars
tranquilly
continued
the
young
man
there
remains
but
exercise
do
i
not
walk
all
day
in
the
governors
garden
if
it
is
finehere
if
it
rains
in
the
fresh
air
if
it
is
warm
in
perfect
warmth
thanks
to
my
winter
stove
if
it
be
cold
ah
monsieur
do
you
fancy
continued
the
prisoner
not
without
bitterness
that
men
have
not
done
everything
for
me
that
a
man
can
hope
for
or
desire
men
said
aramis
be
it
so
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
forgetting
heaven
indeed
i
have
forgotten
heaven
murmured
the
prisoner
with
emotion
but
why
do
you
mention
it
of
what
use
is
it
to
talk
to
a
prisoner
of
heaven
aramis
looked
steadily
at
this
singular
youth
who
possessed
the
resignation
of
a
martyr
with
the
smile
of
an
atheist
is
not
heaven
in
everything
he
murmured
in
a
reproachful
tone
say
rather
at
the
end
of
everything
answered
the
prisoner
firmly
be
it
so
said
aramis
but
let
us
return
to
our
startingpoint
i
ask
nothing
better
returned
the
young
man
i
am
your
confessor
yes
well
then
you
ought
as
a
penitent
to
tell
me
the
truth
my
whole
desire
is
to
tell
it
you
every
prisoner
has
committed
some
crime
for
which
he
has
been
imprisoned
what
crime
then
have
you
committed
you
asked
me
the
same
question
the
first
time
you
saw
me
returned
the
prisoner
and
then
as
now
you
evaded
giving
me
an
answer
and
what
reason
have
you
for
thinking
that
i
shall
now
reply
to
you
because
this
time
i
am
your
confessor
then
if
you
wish
me
to
tell
what
crime
i
have
committed
explain
to
me
in
what
a
crime
consists
for
as
my
conscience
does
not
accuse
me
i
aver
that
i
am
not
a
criminal
we
are
often
criminals
in
the
sight
of
the
great
of
the
earth
not
alone
for
having
ourselves
committed
crimes
but
because
we
know
that
crimes
have
been
committed
the
prisoner
manifested
the
deepest
attention
yes
i
understand
you
he
said
after
a
pause
yes
you
are
right
monsieur
it
is
very
possible
that
in
such
a
light
i
am
a
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
great
of
the
earth
ah
then
you
know
something
said
aramis
who
thought
he
had
pierced
not
merely
through
a
defect
in
the
harness
but
through
the
joints
of
it
no
i
am
not
aware
of
anything
replied
the
young
man
but
sometimes
i
thinkand
i
say
to
myself
what
do
you
say
to
yourself
that
if
i
were
to
think
but
a
little
more
deeply
i
should
either
go
mad
or
i
should
divine
a
great
deal
and
thenand
then
said
aramis
impatiently
then
i
leave
off
you
leave
off
yes
my
head
becomes
confused
and
my
ideas
melancholy
i
feel
ennui
overtaking
me
i
wish
what
i
dont
know
but
i
do
not
like
to
give
myself
up
to
longing
for
things
which
i
do
not
possess
when
i
am
so
happy
with
what
i
have
you
are
afraid
of
death
said
aramis
with
a
slight
uneasiness
yes
said
the
young
man
smiling
aramis
felt
the
chill
of
that
smile
and
shuddered
oh
as
you
fear
death
you
know
more
about
matters
than
you
say
he
cried
and
you
returned
the
prisoner
who
bade
me
to
ask
to
see
you
you
who
when
i
did
ask
to
see
you
came
here
promising
a
world
of
confidence
how
is
it
that
nevertheless
it
is
you
who
are
silent
leaving
it
for
me
to
speak
since
then
we
both
wear
masks
either
let
us
both
retain
them
or
put
them
aside
together
aramis
felt
the
force
and
justice
of
the
remark
saying
to
himself
this
is
no
ordinary
man
i
must
be
cautiousare
you
ambitious
said
he
suddenly
to
the
prisoner
aloud
without
preparing
him
for
the
alteration
what
do
you
mean
by
ambitious
replied
the
youth
ambition
replied
aramis
is
the
feeling
which
prompts
a
man
to
desire
moremuch
morethan
he
possesses
i
said
that
i
was
contented
monsieur
but
perhaps
i
deceive
myself
i
am
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
ambition
but
it
is
not
impossible
i
may
have
some
tell
me
your
mind
that
is
all
i
ask
an
ambitious
man
said
aramis
is
one
who
covets
that
which
is
beyond
his
station
i
covet
nothing
beyond
my
station
said
the
young
man
with
an
assurance
of
manner
which
for
the
second
time
made
the
bishop
of
vannes
tremble
he
was
silent
but
to
look
at
the
kindling
eye
the
knitted
brow
and
the
reflective
attitude
of
the
captive
it
was
evident
that
he
expected
something
more
than
silencea
silence
which
aramis
now
broke
you
lied
the
first
time
i
saw
you
said
he
lied
cried
the
young
man
starting
up
on
his
couch
with
such
a
tone
in
his
voice
and
such
a
lightning
in
his
eyes
that
aramis
recoiled
in
spite
of
himself
i
should
say
returned
aramis
bowing
you
concealed
from
me
what
you
knew
of
your
infancy
a
mans
secrets
are
his
own
monsieur
retorted
the
prisoner
and
not
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
chancecomer
true
said
aramis
bowing
still
lower
than
before
tis
true
pardon
me
but
today
do
i
still
occupy
the
place
of
a
chancecomer
i
beseech
you
to
reply
monseigneur
this
title
slightly
disturbed
the
prisoner
but
nevertheless
he
did
not
appear
astonished
that
it
was
given
him
i
do
not
know
you
monsieur
said
he
oh
but
if
i
dared
i
would
take
your
hand
and
kiss
it
the
young
man
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
to
give
aramis
his
hand
but
the
light
which
beamed
in
his
eyes
faded
away
and
he
coldly
and
distrustfully
withdrew
his
hand
again
kiss
the
hand
of
a
prisoner
he
said
shaking
his
head
to
what
purpose
why
did
you
tell
me
said
aramis
that
you
were
happy
here
why
that
you
aspired
to
nothing
why
in
a
word
by
thus
speaking
do
you
prevent
me
from
being
frank
in
my
turn
the
same
light
shone
a
third
time
in
the
young
mans
eyes
but
died
ineffectually
away
as
before
you
distrust
me
said
aramis
and
why
say
you
so
monsieur
oh
for
a
very
simple
reason
if
you
know
what
you
ought
to
know
you
ought
to
mistrust
everybody
then
do
not
be
astonished
that
i
am
mistrustful
since
you
suspect
me
of
knowing
what
i
do
not
know
aramis
was
struck
with
admiration
at
this
energetic
resistance
oh
monseigneur
you
drive
me
to
despair
said
he
striking
the
armchair
with
his
fist
and
on
my
part
i
do
not
comprehend
you
monsieur
well
then
try
to
understand
me
the
prisoner
looked
fixedly
at
aramis
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
said
the
latter
that
i
have
before
me
the
man
whom
i
seek
and
then
and
then
your
man
disappearsis
it
not
so
said
the
prisoner
smiling
so
much
the
better
aramis
rose
certainly
said
he
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
to
a
man
who
mistrusts
me
as
you
do
and
i
monsieur
said
the
prisoner
in
the
same
tone
have
nothing
to
say
to
a
man
who
will
not
understand
that
a
prisoner
ought
to
be
mistrustful
of
everybody
even
of
his
old
friends
said
aramis
oh
monseigneur
you
are
too
prudent
of
my
old
friendsyou
one
of
my
old
friendsyou
do
you
no
longer
remember
said
aramis
that
you
once
saw
in
the
village
where
your
early
years
were
spent
do
you
know
the
name
of
the
village
asked
the
prisoner
noisylesec
monseigneur
answered
aramis
firmly
go
on
said
the
young
man
with
an
immovable
aspect
stay
monseigneur
said
aramis
if
you
are
positively
resolved
to
carry
on
this
game
let
us
break
off
i
am
here
to
tell
you
many
things
tis
true
but
you
must
allow
me
to
see
that
on
your
side
you
have
a
desire
to
know
them
before
revealing
the
important
matters
i
still
withhold
be
assured
i
am
in
need
of
some
encouragement
if
not
candor
a
little
sympathy
if
not
confidence
but
you
keep
yourself
intrenched
in
a
pretended
which
paralyzes
me
oh
not
for
the
reason
you
think
for
ignorant
as
you
may
be
or
indifferent
as
you
feign
to
be
you
are
none
the
less
what
you
are
monseigneur
and
there
is
nothingnothing
mark
me
which
can
cause
you
not
to
be
so
i
promise
you
replied
the
prisoner
to
hear
you
without
impatience
only
it
appears
to
me
that
i
have
a
right
to
repeat
the
question
i
have
already
asked
who
are
you
do
you
remember
fifteen
or
eighteen
years
ago
seeing
at
noisylesec
a
cavalier
accompanied
by
a
lady
in
black
silk
with
flamecolored
ribbons
in
her
hair
yes
said
the
young
man
i
once
asked
the
name
of
this
cavalier
and
they
told
me
that
he
called
himself
the
abbe
dherblay
i
was
astonished
that
the
abbe
had
so
warlike
an
air
and
they
replied
that
there
was
nothing
singular
in
that
seeing
that
he
was
one
of
louis
xiiis
musketeers
well
said
aramis
that
musketeer
and
abbe
afterwards
bishop
of
vannes
is
your
confessor
now
i
know
it
i
recognized
you
then
monseigneur
if
you
know
that
i
must
further
add
a
fact
of
which
you
are
ignorantthat
if
the
king
were
to
know
this
evening
of
the
presence
of
this
musketeer
this
abbe
this
bishop
this
confessor
herehe
who
has
risked
everything
to
visit
you
tomorrow
would
behold
the
steely
glitter
of
the
executioners
axe
in
a
dungeon
more
gloomy
more
obscure
than
yours
while
listening
to
these
words
delivered
with
emphasis
the
young
man
had
raised
himself
on
his
couch
and
was
now
gazing
more
and
more
eagerly
at
aramis
the
result
of
his
scrutiny
was
that
he
appeared
to
derive
some
confidence
from
it
yes
he
murmured
i
remember
perfectly
the
woman
of
whom
you
speak
came
once
with
you
and
twice
afterwards
with
another
he
hesitated
with
another
who
came
to
see
you
every
monthis
it
not
so
monseigneur
yes
do
you
know
who
this
lady
was
the
light
seemed
ready
to
flash
from
the
prisoners
eyes
i
am
aware
that
she
was
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
he
said
you
remember
that
lady
well
do
you
not
oh
my
recollection
can
hardly
be
very
confused
on
this
head
said
the
young
prisoner
i
saw
that
lady
once
with
a
gentleman
about
fortyfive
years
old
i
saw
her
once
with
you
and
with
the
lady
dressed
in
black
i
have
seen
her
twice
since
then
with
the
same
person
these
four
people
with
my
master
and
old
perronnette
my
jailer
and
the
governor
of
the
prison
are
the
only
persons
with
whom
i
have
ever
spoken
and
indeed
almost
the
only
persons
i
have
ever
seen
then
you
were
in
prison
if
i
am
a
prisoner
here
then
i
was
comparatively
free
although
in
a
very
narrow
sensea
house
i
never
quitted
a
garden
surrounded
with
walls
i
could
not
climb
these
constituted
my
residence
but
you
know
it
as
you
have
been
there
in
a
word
being
accustomed
to
live
within
these
bounds
i
never
cared
to
leave
them
and
so
you
will
understand
monsieur
that
having
never
seen
anything
of
the
world
i
have
nothing
left
to
care
for
and
therefore
if
you
relate
anything
you
will
be
obliged
to
explain
each
item
to
me
as
you
go
along
and
i
will
do
so
said
aramis
bowing
for
it
is
my
duty
monseigneur
well
then
begin
by
telling
me
who
was
my
tutor
a
worthy
and
above
all
an
honorable
gentleman
monseigneur
fit
guide
for
both
body
and
soul
had
you
ever
any
reason
to
complain
of
him
oh
no
quite
the
contrary
but
this
gentleman
of
yours
often
used
to
tell
me
that
my
father
and
mother
were
dead
did
he
deceive
me
or
did
he
speak
the
truth
he
was
compelled
to
comply
with
the
orders
given
him
then
he
lied
in
one
respect
your
father
is
dead
and
my
mother
she
is
dead
for
you
but
then
she
lives
for
others
does
she
not
yes
and
iand
i
then
the
young
man
looked
sharply
at
aramis
am
compelled
to
live
in
the
obscurity
of
a
prison
alas
i
fear
so
and
that
because
my
presence
in
the
world
would
lead
to
the
revelation
of
a
great
secret
certainly
a
very
great
secret
my
enemy
must
indeed
be
powerful
to
be
able
to
shut
up
in
the
bastile
a
child
such
as
i
then
was
he
is
more
powerful
than
my
mother
then
and
why
do
you
ask
that
because
my
mother
would
have
taken
my
part
aramis
hesitated
yes
monseigneur
more
powerful
than
your
mother
seeing
then
that
my
nurse
and
preceptor
were
carried
off
and
that
i
also
was
separated
from
themeither
they
were
or
i
am
very
dangerous
to
my
enemy
yes
but
you
are
alluding
to
a
peril
from
which
he
freed
himself
by
causing
the
nurse
and
preceptor
to
disappear
answered
aramis
quietly
disappear
cried
the
prisoner
how
did
they
disappear
in
a
very
sure
way
answered
aramisthey
are
dead
the
young
man
turned
pale
and
passed
his
hand
tremblingly
over
his
face
poison
he
asked
poison
the
prisoner
reflected
a
moment
my
enemy
must
indeed
have
been
very
cruel
or
hard
beset
by
necessity
to
assassinate
those
two
innocent
people
my
sole
support
for
the
worthy
gentleman
and
the
poor
nurse
had
never
harmed
a
living
being
in
your
family
monseigneur
necessity
is
stern
and
so
it
is
necessity
which
compels
me
to
my
great
regret
to
tell
you
that
this
gentleman
and
the
unhappy
lady
have
been
assassinated
oh
you
tell
me
nothing
i
am
not
aware
of
said
the
prisoner
knitting
his
brows
how
i
suspected
it
why
i
will
tell
you
at
this
moment
the
young
man
supporting
himself
on
his
two
elbows
drew
close
to
aramiss
face
with
such
an
expression
of
dignity
of
selfcommand
and
of
defiance
even
that
the
bishop
felt
the
electricity
of
enthusiasm
strike
in
devouring
flashes
from
that
great
heart
of
his
into
his
brain
of
adamant
speak
monseigneur
i
have
already
told
you
that
by
conversing
with
you
i
endanger
my
life
little
value
as
it
has
i
implore
you
to
accept
it
as
the
ransom
of
your
own
well
resumed
the
young
man
this
is
why
i
suspected
they
had
killed
my
nurse
and
my
preceptor
whom
you
used
to
call
your
father
yes
whom
i
called
my
father
but
whose
son
i
well
knew
i
was
not
who
caused
you
to
suppose
so
just
as
you
monsieur
are
too
respectful
for
a
friend
he
was
also
too
respectful
for
a
father
i
however
said
aramis
have
no
intention
to
disguise
myself
the
young
man
nodded
assent
and
continued
undoubtedly
i
was
not
destined
to
perpetual
seclusion
said
the
prisoner
and
that
which
makes
me
believe
so
above
all
now
is
the
care
that
was
taken
to
render
me
as
accomplished
a
cavalier
as
possible
the
gentleman
attached
to
my
person
taught
me
everything
he
knew
himselfmathematics
a
little
geometry
astronomy
fencing
and
riding
every
morning
i
went
through
military
exercises
and
practiced
on
horseback
well
one
morning
during
the
summer
it
being
very
hot
i
went
to
sleep
in
the
hall
nothing
up
to
that
period
except
the
respect
paid
me
had
enlightened
me
or
even
roused
my
suspicions
i
lived
as
children
as
birds
as
plants
as
the
air
and
the
sun
do
i
had
just
turned
my
fifteenth
year
this
then
is
eight
years
ago
yes
nearly
but
i
have
ceased
to
reckon
time
excuse
me
but
what
did
your
tutor
tell
you
to
encourage
you
to
work
he
used
to
say
that
a
man
was
bound
to
make
for
himself
in
the
world
that
fortune
which
heaven
had
refused
him
at
his
birth
he
added
that
being
a
poor
obscure
orphan
i
had
no
one
but
myself
to
look
to
and
that
nobody
either
did
or
ever
would
take
any
interest
in
me
i
was
then
in
the
hall
i
have
spoken
of
asleep
from
fatigue
with
long
fencing
my
preceptor
was
in
his
room
on
the
first
floor
just
over
me
suddenly
i
heard
him
exclaim
and
then
he
called
perronnette
perronnette
it
was
my
nurse
whom
he
called
yes
i
know
it
said
aramis
continue
monseigneur
very
likely
she
was
in
the
garden
for
my
preceptor
came
hastily
downstairs
i
rose
anxious
at
seeing
him
anxious
he
opened
the
gardendoor
still
crying
out
perronnette
perronnette
the
windows
of
the
hall
looked
into
the
court
the
shutters
were
closed
but
through
a
chink
in
them
i
saw
my
tutor
draw
near
a
large
well
which
was
almost
directly
under
the
windows
of
his
study
he
stooped
over
the
brim
looked
into
the
well
and
again
cried
out
and
made
wild
and
affrighted
gestures
where
i
was
i
could
not
only
see
but
hearand
see
and
hear
i
did
go
on
i
pray
you
said
aramis
dame
perronnette
came
running
up
hearing
the
governors
cries
he
went
to
meet
her
took
her
by
the
arm
and
drew
her
quickly
towards
the
edge
after
which
as
they
both
bent
over
it
together
look
look
cried
he
what
a
misfortune
calm
yourself
calm
yourself
said
perronnette
what
is
the
matter
the
letter
he
exclaimed
do
you
see
that
letter
pointing
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
what
letter
she
cried
the
letter
you
see
down
there
the
last
letter
from
the
queen
at
this
word
i
trembled
my
tutorhe
who
passed
for
my
father
he
who
was
continually
recommending
me
modesty
and
humilityin
correspondence
with
the
queen
the
queens
last
letter
cried
perronnette
without
showing
more
astonishment
than
at
seeing
this
letter
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
but
how
came
it
there
a
chance
dame
perronnettea
singular
chance
i
was
entering
my
room
and
on
opening
the
door
the
window
too
being
open
a
puff
of
air
came
suddenly
and
carried
off
this
paperthis
letter
of
her
majestys
i
darted
after
it
and
gained
the
window
just
in
time
to
see
it
flutter
a
moment
in
the
breeze
and
disappear
down
the
well
well
said
dame
perronnette
and
if
the
letter
has
fallen
into
the
well
tis
all
the
same
as
if
it
was
burnt
and
as
the
queen
burns
all
her
letters
every
time
she
comes
and
so
you
see
this
lady
who
came
every
month
was
the
queen
said
the
prisoner
doubtless
doubtless
continued
the
old
gentleman
but
this
letter
contained
instructionshow
can
i
follow
them
write
immediately
to
her
give
her
a
plain
account
of
the
accident
and
the
queen
will
no
doubt
write
you
another
letter
in
place
of
this
oh
the
queen
would
never
believe
the
story
said
the
good
gentleman
shaking
his
head
she
will
imagine
that
i
want
to
keep
this
letter
instead
of
giving
it
up
like
the
rest
so
as
to
have
a
hold
over
her
she
is
so
distrustful
and
m
de
mazarin
soyon
devil
of
an
italian
is
capable
of
having
us
poisoned
at
the
first
breath
of
suspicion
aramis
almost
imperceptibly
smiled
you
know
dame
perronnette
they
are
both
so
suspicious
in
all
that
concerns
philippe
philippe
was
the
name
they
gave
me
said
the
prisoner
well
tis
no
use
hesitating
said
dame
perronnette
somebody
must
go
down
the
well
of
course
so
that
the
person
who
goes
down
may
read
the
paper
as
he
is
coming
up
but
let
us
choose
some
villager
who
cannot
read
and
then
you
will
be
at
ease
granted
but
will
not
any
one
who
descends
guess
that
a
paper
must
be
important
for
which
we
risk
a
mans
life
however
you
have
given
me
an
idea
dame
perronnette
somebody
shall
go
down
the
well
but
that
somebody
shall
be
myself
but
at
this
notion
dame
perronnette
lamented
and
cried
in
such
a
manner
and
so
implored
the
old
nobleman
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
he
promised
her
to
obtain
a
ladder
long
enough
to
reach
down
while
she
went
in
search
of
some
stouthearted
youth
whom
she
was
to
persuade
that
a
jewel
had
fallen
into
the
well
and
that
this
jewel
was
wrapped
in
a
paper
and
as
paper
remarked
my
preceptor
naturally
unfolds
in
water
the
young
man
would
not
be
surprised
at
finding
nothing
after
all
but
the
letter
wide
open
but
perhaps
the
writing
will
be
already
effaced
by
that
time
said
dame
perronnette
no
consequence
provided
we
secure
the
letter
on
returning
it
to
the
queen
she
will
see
at
once
that
we
have
not
betrayed
her
and
consequently
as
we
shall
not
rouse
the
distrust
of
mazarin
we
shall
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
having
come
to
this
resolution
they
parted
i
pushed
back
the
shutter
and
seeing
that
my
tutor
was
about
to
reenter
i
threw
myself
on
my
couch
in
a
confusion
of
brain
caused
by
all
i
had
just
heard
my
governor
opened
the
door
a
few
moments
after
and
thinking
i
was
asleep
gently
closed
it
again
as
soon
as
ever
it
was
shut
i
rose
and
listening
heard
the
sound
of
retiring
footsteps
then
i
returned
to
the
shutters
and
saw
my
tutor
and
dame
perronnette
go
out
together
i
was
alone
in
the
house
they
had
hardly
closed
the
gate
before
i
sprang
from
the
window
and
ran
to
the
well
then
just
as
my
governor
had
leaned
over
so
leaned
i
something
white
and
luminous
glistened
in
the
green
and
quivering
silence
of
the
water
the
brilliant
disk
fascinated
and
allured
me
my
eyes
became
fixed
and
i
could
hardly
breathe
the
well
seemed
to
draw
me
downwards
with
its
slimy
mouth
and
icy
breath
and
i
thought
i
read
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
characters
of
fire
traced
upon
the
letter
the
queen
had
touched
then
scarcely
knowing
what
i
was
about
and
urged
on
by
one
of
those
instinctive
impulses
which
drive
men
to
destruction
i
lowered
the
cord
from
the
windlass
of
the
well
to
within
about
three
feet
of
the
water
leaving
the
bucket
dangling
at
the
same
time
taking
infinite
pains
not
to
disturb
that
coveted
letter
which
was
beginning
to
change
its
white
tint
for
the
hue
of
chrysopraseproof
enough
that
it
was
sinkingand
then
with
the
rope
weltering
in
my
hands
slid
down
into
the
abyss
when
i
saw
myself
hanging
over
the
dark
pool
when
i
saw
the
sky
lessening
above
my
head
a
cold
shudder
came
over
me
a
chill
fear
got
the
better
of
me
i
was
seized
with
giddiness
and
the
hair
rose
on
my
head
but
my
strong
will
still
reigned
supreme
over
all
the
terror
and
disquietude
i
gained
the
water
and
at
once
plunged
into
it
holding
on
by
one
hand
while
i
immersed
the
other
and
seized
the
dear
letter
which
alas
came
in
two
in
my
grasp
i
concealed
the
two
fragments
in
my
bodycoat
and
helping
myself
with
my
feet
against
the
sides
of
the
pit
and
clinging
on
with
my
hands
agile
and
vigorous
as
i
was
and
above
all
pressed
for
time
i
regained
the
brink
drenching
it
as
i
touched
it
with
the
water
that
streamed
off
me
i
was
no
sooner
out
of
the
well
with
my
prize
than
i
rushed
into
the
sunlight
and
took
refuge
in
a
kind
of
shrubbery
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
as
i
entered
my
hidingplace
the
bell
which
resounded
when
the
great
gate
was
opened
rang
it
was
my
preceptor
come
back
again
i
had
but
just
time
i
calculated
that
it
would
take
ten
minutes
before
he
would
gain
my
place
of
concealment
even
if
guessing
where
i
was
he
came
straight
to
it
and
twenty
if
he
were
obliged
to
look
for
me
but
this
was
time
enough
to
allow
me
to
read
the
cherished
letter
whose
fragments
i
hastened
to
unite
again
the
writing
was
already
fading
but
i
managed
to
decipher
it
all
and
will
you
tell
me
what
you
read
therein
monseigneur
asked
aramis
deeply
interested
quite
enough
monsieur
to
see
that
my
tutor
was
a
man
of
noble
rank
and
that
perronnette
without
being
a
lady
of
quality
was
far
better
than
a
servant
and
also
to
perceived
that
i
must
myself
be
highborn
since
the
queen
anne
of
austria
and
mazarin
the
prime
minister
commended
me
so
earnestly
to
their
care
here
the
young
man
paused
quite
overcome
and
what
happened
asked
aramis
it
happened
monsieur
answered
he
that
the
workmen
they
had
summoned
found
nothing
in
the
well
after
the
closest
search
that
my
governor
perceived
that
the
brink
was
all
watery
that
i
was
not
so
dried
by
the
sun
as
to
prevent
dame
perronnette
spying
that
my
garments
were
moist
and
lastly
that
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
fever
owing
to
the
chill
and
the
excitement
of
my
discovery
an
attack
of
delirium
supervening
during
which
i
related
the
whole
adventure
so
that
guided
by
my
avowal
my
governor
found
the
pieces
of
the
queens
letter
inside
the
bolster
where
i
had
concealed
them
ah
said
aramis
now
i
understand
beyond
this
all
is
conjecture
doubtless
the
unfortunate
lady
and
gentleman
not
daring
to
keep
the
occurrence
secret
wrote
of
all
this
to
the
queen
and
sent
back
the
torn
letter
after
which
said
aramis
you
were
arrested
and
removed
to
the
bastile
as
you
see
your
two
attendants
disappeared
alas
let
us
not
take
up
our
time
with
the
dead
but
see
what
can
be
done
with
the
living
you
told
me
you
were
resigned
i
repeat
it
without
any
desire
for
freedom
as
i
told
you
without
ambition
sorrow
or
thought
the
young
man
made
no
answer
well
asked
aramis
why
are
you
silent
i
think
i
have
spoken
enough
answered
the
prisoner
and
that
now
it
is
your
turn
i
am
weary
aramis
gathered
himself
up
and
a
shade
of
deep
solemnity
spread
itself
over
his
countenance
it
was
evident
that
he
had
reached
the
crisis
in
the
part
he
had
come
to
the
prison
to
play
one
question
said
aramis
what
is
it
speak
in
the
house
you
inhabited
there
were
neither
lookingglasses
nor
mirrors
what
are
those
two
words
and
what
is
their
meaning
asked
the
young
man
i
have
no
sort
of
knowledge
of
them
they
designate
two
pieces
of
furniture
which
reflect
objects
so
that
for
instance
you
may
see
in
them
your
own
lineaments
as
you
see
mine
now
with
the
naked
eye
no
there
was
neither
a
glass
nor
a
mirror
in
the
house
answered
the
young
man
aramis
looked
round
him
nor
is
there
anything
of
the
kind
here
either
he
said
they
have
again
taken
the
same
precaution
to
what
end
you
will
know
directly
now
you
have
told
me
that
you
were
instructed
in
mathematics
astronomy
fencing
and
riding
but
you
have
not
said
a
word
about
history
my
tutor
sometimes
related
to
me
the
principal
deeds
of
the
king
st
louis
king
francis
i
and
king
henry
iv
is
that
all
very
nearly
this
also
was
done
by
design
then
just
as
they
deprived
you
of
mirrors
which
reflect
the
present
so
they
left
you
in
ignorance
of
history
which
reflects
the
past
since
your
imprisonment
books
have
been
forbidden
you
so
that
you
are
unacquainted
with
a
number
of
facts
by
means
of
which
you
would
be
able
to
reconstruct
the
shattered
mansion
of
your
recollections
and
your
hopes
it
is
true
said
the
young
man
listen
then
i
will
in
a
few
words
tell
you
what
has
passed
in
france
during
the
last
twentythree
or
twentyfour
years
that
is
from
the
probable
date
of
your
birth
in
a
word
from
the
time
that
interests
you
say
on
and
the
young
man
resumed
his
serious
and
attentive
attitude
do
you
know
who
was
the
son
of
henry
iv
at
least
i
know
who
his
successor
was
how
by
means
of
a
coin
dated
1610
which
bears
the
effigy
of
henry
iv
and
another
of
1612
bearing
that
of
louis
xiii
so
i
presumed
that
there
being
only
two
years
between
the
two
dates
louis
was
henrys
successor
then
said
aramis
you
know
that
the
last
reigning
monarch
was
louis
xiii
i
do
answered
the
youth
slightly
reddening
well
he
was
a
prince
full
of
noble
ideas
and
great
projects
always
alas
deferred
by
the
trouble
of
the
times
and
the
dread
struggle
that
his
minister
richelieu
had
to
maintain
against
the
great
nobles
of
france
the
king
himself
was
of
a
feeble
character
and
died
young
and
unhappy
i
know
it
he
had
been
long
anxious
about
having
a
heir
a
care
which
weighs
heavily
on
princes
who
desire
to
leave
behind
them
more
than
one
pledge
that
their
best
thoughts
and
works
will
be
continued
did
the
king
then
die
childless
asked
the
prisoner
smiling
no
but
he
was
long
without
one
and
for
a
long
while
thought
he
should
be
the
last
of
his
race
this
idea
had
reduced
him
to
the
depths
of
despair
when
suddenly
his
wife
anne
of
austria
the
prisoner
trembled
did
you
know
said
aramis
that
louis
xiiis
wife
was
called
anne
of
austria
continue
said
the
young
man
without
replying
to
the
question
when
suddenly
resumed
aramis
the
queen
announced
an
interesting
event
there
was
great
joy
at
the
intelligence
and
all
prayed
for
her
happy
delivery
on
the
5th
of
september
1638
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
here
aramis
looked
at
his
companion
and
thought
he
observed
him
turning
pale
you
are
about
to
hear
said
aramis
an
account
which
few
indeed
could
now
avouch
for
it
refers
to
a
secret
which
they
imagined
buried
with
the
dead
entombed
in
the
abyss
of
the
confessional
and
you
will
tell
me
this
secret
broke
in
the
youth
oh
said
aramis
with
unmistakable
emphasis
i
do
not
know
that
i
ought
to
risk
this
secret
by
intrusting
it
to
one
who
has
no
desire
to
quit
the
bastile
i
hear
you
monsieur
the
queen
then
gave
birth
to
a
son
but
while
the
court
was
rejoicing
over
the
event
when
the
king
had
shown
the
newborn
child
to
the
nobility
and
people
and
was
sitting
gayly
down
to
table
to
celebrate
the
event
the
queen
who
was
alone
in
her
room
was
again
taken
ill
and
gave
birth
to
a
second
son
oh
said
the
prisoner
betraying
a
better
acquaintance
with
affairs
than
he
had
owned
to
i
thought
that
monsieur
was
only
born
in
aramis
raised
his
finger
permit
me
to
continue
he
said
the
prisoner
sighed
impatiently
and
paused
yes
said
aramis
the
queen
had
a
second
son
whom
dame
perronnette
the
midwife
received
in
her
arms
dame
perronnette
murmured
the
young
man
they
ran
at
once
to
the
banquetingroom
and
whispered
to
the
king
what
had
happened
he
rose
and
quitted
the
table
but
this
time
it
was
no
longer
happiness
that
his
face
expressed
but
something
akin
to
terror
the
birth
of
twins
changed
into
bitterness
the
joy
to
which
that
of
an
only
son
had
given
rise
seeing
that
in
france
a
fact
you
are
assuredly
ignorant
of
it
is
the
oldest
of
the
kings
sons
who
succeeds
his
father
i
know
it
and
that
the
doctors
and
jurists
assert
that
there
is
ground
for
doubting
whether
the
son
that
first
makes
his
appearance
is
the
elder
by
the
law
of
heaven
and
of
nature
the
prisoner
uttered
a
smothered
cry
and
became
whiter
than
the
coverlet
under
which
he
hid
himself
now
you
understand
pursued
aramis
that
the
king
who
with
so
much
pleasure
saw
himself
repeated
in
one
was
in
despair
about
two
fearing
that
the
second
might
dispute
the
firsts
claim
to
seniority
which
had
been
recognized
only
two
hours
before
and
so
this
second
son
relying
on
party
interests
and
caprices
might
one
day
sow
discord
and
engender
civil
war
throughout
the
kingdom
by
these
means
destroying
the
very
dynasty
he
should
have
strengthened
oh
i
understandi
understand
murmured
the
young
man
well
continued
aramis
this
is
what
they
relate
what
they
declare
this
is
why
one
of
the
queens
two
sons
shamefully
parted
from
his
brother
shamefully
sequestered
is
buried
in
profound
obscurity
this
is
why
that
second
son
has
disappeared
and
so
completely
that
not
a
soul
in
france
save
his
mother
is
aware
of
his
existence
yes
his
mother
who
has
cast
him
off
cried
the
prisoner
in
a
tone
of
despair
except
also
aramis
went
on
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
and
finally
excepting
excepting
yourselfis
it
not
you
who
come
and
relate
all
this
you
who
rouse
in
my
soul
curiosity
hatred
ambition
and
perhaps
even
the
thirst
of
vengeance
except
you
monsieur
who
if
you
are
the
man
to
whom
i
expect
whom
the
note
i
have
received
applies
to
whom
in
short
heaven
ought
to
send
me
must
possess
about
you
what
asked
aramis
a
portrait
of
the
king
louis
xiv
who
at
this
moment
reigns
upon
the
throne
of
france
here
is
the
portrait
replied
the
bishop
handing
the
prisoner
a
miniature
in
enamel
on
which
louis
was
depicted
lifelike
with
a
handsome
lofty
mien
the
prisoner
eagerly
seized
the
portrait
and
gazed
at
it
with
devouring
eyes
and
now
monseigneur
said
aramis
here
is
a
mirror
aramis
left
the
prisoner
time
to
recover
his
ideas
so
highso
high
murmured
the
young
man
eagerly
comparing
the
likeness
of
louis
with
his
own
countenance
reflected
in
the
glass
what
do
you
think
of
it
at
length
said
aramis
i
think
that
i
am
lost
replied
the
captive
the
king
will
never
set
me
free
and
ii
demand
to
know
added
the
bishop
fixing
his
piercing
eyes
significantly
upon
the
prisoner
i
demand
to
know
which
of
these
two
is
king
the
one
this
miniature
portrays
or
whom
the
glass
reflects
the
king
monsieur
sadly
replied
the
young
man
is
he
who
is
on
the

if
you

quitting

monsieur
broke
in
the

bitterly

monseigneur

aramis
i
have
brought
you
all
the
proofs

yourself
that
you

no
it
is
impossible
unless
indeed
resumed
the
bishop
ironically
it
be
the
destiny
of
your
race
that
the
brothers
excluded
from
the
throne
should
be
always
princes
void
of
courage
and
honesty
as
was
your
uncle
m

who
ten
times
conspired
against
his
brother

what
cried
the
prince
astonished
my
uncle
gaston
conspired
against
his
brother
conspired
to
dethrone
him
exactly
monseigneur
for
no
other
reason
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
he
had
friendsdevoted

as
much
so
as
i
am
to
you
and
after
all
what

he
dofailed
he
failed

always
through
his

the
lives
of
all
his

one
after
another
and
so
at
this
day
he
is
a
very
blot
on
history
the
detestation
of
a
hundred
noble
families
in
this
kingdom
i
understand
monsieur
either
by
weakness
or
treachery
my
uncle
slew
his
friends
by
weakness
which
in
princes
is
always
treachery
and
cannot
a
man
fail
then
from
incapacity
and
ignorance
do
you
really
believe
it
possible
that
a
poor
captive
such
as
i
brought
up
not
only
at
a
distance
from
the
court
but
even
from
the
worlddo
you
believe
it
possible
that
such
a
one
could
assist
those
of
his
friends
who
should
attempt
to
serve
him
and
as
aramis
was
about
to
reply
the
young
man
suddenly
cried
out
with
a
violence
which
betrayed
the
temper
of
his
blood
we
are
speaking
of
friends
but
how
can
i
have
any
friendsi
whom
no
one
knows
and
have
neither
liberty
money
nor
influence
to
gain
any
i
fancy
i
had
the
honor
to
offer
myself
to
your
royal
highness
oh
do
not
style
me
so
monsieur
tis
either
treachery
or
cruelty
bid
me
not
think
of
aught
beyond
these
prisonwalls
which
so
grimly
confine
me
let
me
again
love
or
at
least
submit
to
my
slavery
and
my
obscurity
monseigneur
monseigneur
if
you
again
utter
these
desperate
wordsif
after
having
received
proof
of
your
high
birth
you
still
remain
poorspirited
in
body
and
soul
i
will
comply
with
your
desire
i
will
depart
and
renounce
forever
the
service
of
a
master
to
whom
so
eagerly
i
came
to
devote
my
assistance
and
my
life
monsieur
cried
the
prince
would
it
not
have
been
better
for
you
to
have
reflected
before
telling
me
all
that
you
have
done
that
you
have
broken
my
heart
forever
and
so
i
desire
to
do
monseigneur
to
talk
to
me
about
power
grandeur
eye
and
to
prate
of
thrones
is
a
prison
the
fit
place
you
wish
to
make
me
believe
in
splendor
and
we
are
lying
lost
in
night
you
boast
of
glory
and
we
are
smothering
our
words
in
the
curtains
of
this
miserable
bed
you
give
me
glimpses
of
power
absolute
whilst
i
hear
the
footsteps
of
the
everywatchful
jailer
in
the
corridorthat
step
which
after
all
makes
you
tremble
more
than
it
does
me
to
render
me
somewhat
less
incredulous
free
me
from
the
bastile
let
me
breathe
the
fresh
air
give
me
my
spurs
and
trusty
sword
then
we
shall
begin
to
understand
each
other
it
is
precisely
my
intention
to
give
you
all
this
monseigneur
and
more
only
do
you
desire
it
a
word
more
said
the
prince
i
know
there
are
guards
in
every
gallery
bolts
to
every
door
cannon
and
soldiery
at
every
barrier
how
will
you
overcome
the
sentriesspike
the
guns
how
will
you
break
through
the
bolts
and
bars
monseigneurhow
did
you
get
the
note
which
announced
my
arrival
to
you
you
can
bribe
a
jailer
for
such
a
thing
as
a
note
if
we
can
corrupt
one
turnkey
we
can
corrupt
ten
well
i
admit
that
it
may
be
possible
to
release
a
poor
captive
from
the
bastile
possible
so
to
conceal
him
that
the
kings
people
shall
not
again
ensnare
him
possible
in
some
unknown
retreat
to
sustain
the
unhappy
wretch
in
some
suitable
manner
monseigneur
said
aramis
smiling
i
admit
that
whoever
would
do
this
much
for
me
would
seem
more
than
mortal
in
my
eyes
but
as
you
tell
me
i
am
a
prince
brother
of
the
king
how
can
you
restore
me
the
rank
and
power
which
my
mother
and
my
brother
have
deprived
me
of
and
as
to
effect
this
i
must
pass
a
life
of
war
and
hatred
how
can
you
cause
me
to
prevail
in
those
combatsrender
me
invulnerable
by
my
enemies
ah
monsieur
reflect
on
all
this
place
me
tomorrow
in
some
dark
cavern
at
a
mountains
base
yield
me
the
delight
of
hearing
in
freedom
sounds
of
the
river
plain
and
valley
of
beholding
in
freedom
the
sun
of
the
blue
heavens
or
the
stormy
sky
and
it
is
enough
promise
me
no
more
than
this
for
indeed
more
you
cannot
give
and
it
would
be
a
crime
to
deceive
me
since
you
call
yourself
my
friend
aramis
waited
in
silence
monseigneur
he
resumed
after
a
moments
reflection
i
admire
the
firm
sound
sense
which
dictates
your
words
i
am
happy
to
have
discovered
my
monarchs
mind
again
again
oh
god
for
mercys
sake
cried
the
prince
pressing
his
icy
hands
upon
his
clammy
brow
do
not
play
with
me
i
have
no
need
to
be
a
king
to
be
the
happiest
of
men
but
i
monseigneur
wish
you
to
be
a
king
for
the
good
of
humanity
ah
said
the
prince
with
fresh
distrust
inspired
by
the
word
ah
with
what
then
has
humanity
to
reproach
my
brother
i
forgot
to
say
monseigneur
that
if
you
would
allow
me
to
guide
you
and
if
you
consent
to
become
the
most
powerful
monarch
in
christendom
you
will
have
promoted
the
interests
of
all
the
friends
whom
i
devote
to
the
success
of
your
cause
and
these
friends
are
numerous
numerous
less
numerous
than
powerful
monseigneur
explain
yourself
it
is
impossible
i
will
explain
i
swear
before
heaven
on
that
day
that
i
see
you
sitting
on
the
throne
of
france
but
my
brother
you
shall
decree
his
fate
do
you
pity
him
him
who
leaves
me
to
perish
in
a
dungeon
no
no
for
him
i
have
no
pity
so
much
the
better
he
might
have
himself
come
to
this
prison
have
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
have
said
my
brother
heaven
created
us
to
love
not
to
contend
with
one
another
i
come
to
you
a
barbarous
prejudice
has
condemned
you
to
pass
your
days
in
obscurity
far
from
mankind
deprived
of
every
joy
i
will
make
you
sit
down
beside
me
i
will
buckle
round
your
waist
our
fathers
sword
will
you
take
advantage
of
this
reconciliation
to
put
down
or
restrain
me
will
you
employ
that
sword
to
spill
my
blood
oh
never
i
would
have
replied
to
him
i
look
on
you
as
my
preserver
i
will
respect
you
as
my
master
you
give
me
far
more
than
heaven
bestowed
for
through
you
i
possess
liberty
and
the
privilege
of
loving
and
being
loved
in
this
world
and
you
would
have
kept
your
word
monseigneur
on
my
life
while
nownow
that
i
have
guilty
ones
to
punish
in
what
manner
monseigneur
what
do
you
say
as
to
the
resemblance
that
heaven
has
given
me
to
my
brother
i
say
that
there
was
in
that
likeness
a
providential
instruction
which
the
king
ought
to
have
heeded
i
say
that
your
mother
committed
a
crime
in
rendering
those
different
in
happiness
and
fortune
whom
nature
created
so
startlingly
alike
of
her
own
flesh
and
i
conclude
that
the
object
of
punishment
should
be
only
to
restore
the
equilibrium
by
which
you
mean
that
if
i
restore
you
to
your
place
on
your
brothers
throne
he
shall
take
yours
in
prison
alas
theres
such
infinity
of
suffering
in
prison
especially
it
would
be
so
for
one
who
has
drunk
so
deeply
of
the
cup
of
enjoyment
your
royal
highness
will
always
be
free
to
act
as
you
may
desire
and
if
it
seems
good
to
you
after
punishment
you
will
have
it
in
your
power
to
pardon
good
and
now
are
you
aware
of
one
thing
monsieur
tell
me
my
prince
it
is
that
i
will
hear
nothing
further
from
you
till
i
am
clear
of
the
bastile
i
was
going
to
say
to
your
highness
that
i
should
only
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
once
again
and
when
the
day
when
my
prince
leaves
these
gloomy
walls
heavens
how
will
you
give
me
notice
of
it
by
myself
coming
to
fetch
you
yourself
my
prince
do
not
leave
this
chamber
save
with
me
or
if
in
my
absence
you
are
compelled
to
do
so
remember
that
i
am
not
concerned
in
it
and
so
i
am
not
to
speak
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
whatever
save
to
you
save
only
to
me
aramis
bowed
very
low
the
prince
offered
his
hand
monsieur
he
said
in
a
tone
that
issued
from
his
heart
one
word
more
my
last
if
you
have
sought
me
for
my
destruction
if
you
are
only
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
my
enemies
if
from
our
conference
in
which
you
have
sounded
the
depths
of
my
mind
anything
worse
than
captivity
result
that
is
to
say
if
death
befall
me
still
receive
my
blessing
for
you
will
have
ended
my
troubles
and
given
me
repose
from
the
tormenting
fever
that
has
preyed
on
me
for
eight
long
weary
years
monseigneur
wait
the
results
ere
you
judge
me
said
aramis
i
say
that
in
such
a
case
i
bless
and
forgive
you
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
come
to
restore
me
to
that
position
in
the
sunshine
of
fortune
and
glory
to
which
i
was
destined
by
heaven
if
by
your
means
i
am
enabled
to
live
in
the
memory
of
man
and
confer
luster
on
my
race
by
deeds
of
valor
or
by
solid
benefits
bestowed
upon
my
people
if
from
my
present
depths
of
sorrow
aided
by
your
generous
hand
i
raise
myself
to
the
very
height
of
honor
then
to
you
whom
i
thank
with
blessings
to
you
will
i
offer
half
my
power
and
my
glory
though
you
would
still
be
but
partly
recompensed
and
your
share
must
always
remain
incomplete
since
i
could
not
divide
with
you
the
happiness
received
at
your
hands
monseigneur
replied
aramis
moved
by
the
pallor
and
excitement
of
the
young
man
the
nobleness
of
your
heart
fills
me
with
joy
and
admiration
it
is
not
you
who
will
have
to
thank
me
but
rather
the
nation
whom
you
will
render
happy
the
posterity
whose
name
you
will
make
glorious
yes
i
shall
indeed
have
bestowed
upon
you
more
than
life
i
shall
have
given
you
immortality
the
prince
offered
his
hand
to
aramis
who
sank
upon
his
knee
and
kissed
it
it
is
the
first
act
of
homage
paid
to
our
future
king

he
when
i
see
you
again

wan
and

fingers
over

then
no
more
dreams
no

should
be
able
to
enter
in
and
to
remain
here
your
royal
highness
makes
me
proud
said
aramis
since
you
infer
it
is
i
who
brought
all
this
and
he
rapped
immediately
on
the
door
the
jailer
came
to
open
it
with
baisemeaux
who
devoured
by
fear
and
uneasiness
was
beginning
in
spite
of
himself
to
listen
at
the
door
happily
neither
of
the
speakers
had
forgotten
to
smother
his
voice
even
in
the
most
passionate
outbreaks
what
a
confessor
said
the
governor
forcing
a
laugh
who
would
believe
that
a
compulsory
recluse
a
man
as
though
in
the
very
jaws
of
death
could
have
committed
crimes
so
numerous
and
so
long
to
tell
of
aramis
made
no
reply
he
was
eager
to
leave
the
bastile
where
the
secret
which
overwhelmed
him
seemed
to
double
the
weight
of
the
walls
as
soon
as
they
reached
baisemeauxs
quarters
let
us
proceed
to
business
my
dear
governor
said
aramis
alas
replied
baisemeaux
you
have
to
ask
me
for
my
receipt
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
said
the
bishop
and
to
pay
over
the
first
third
of
the
sum
added
the
poor
governor
with
a
sigh
taking
three
steps
towards
his
iron
strongbox
here
is
the
receipt
said
aramis
and
here
is
the
money
returned
baisemeaux
with
a
threefold
sigh
the
order
instructed
me
only
to
give
a
receipt
it
said
nothing
about
receiving
the
money
rejoined
aramis
adieu
monsieur
le
governeur
and
he
departed
leaving
baisemeaux
almost
more
than
stifled
with
joy
and
surprise
at
this
regal
present
so
liberally
bestowed
by
the
confessor
extraordinary
to
the
bastile
chapter
ii
how
mouston
had
become
fatter
without
giving
porthos
notice
thereof
and
of
the
troubles
which
consequently
befell
that
worthy
gentleman
since
the
departure
of
athos
for
blois
porthos
and
dartagnan
were
seldom
together
one
was
occupied
with
harassing
duties
for
the
king
the
other
had
been
making
many
purchases
of
furniture
which
he
intended
to
forward
to
his
estate
and
by
aid
of
which
he
hoped
to
establish
in
his
various
residences
something
of
the
courtly
luxury
he
had
witnessed
in
all
its
dazzling
brightness
in
his
majestys
society
dartagnan
ever
faithful
one
morning
during
an
interval
of
service
thought
about
porthos
and
being
uneasy
at
not
having
heard
anything
of
him
for
a
fortnight
directed
his
steps
towards
his
hotel
and
pounced
upon
him
just
as
he
was
getting
up
the
worthy
baron
had
a
pensivenay
more
than
pensivemelancholy
air
he
was
sitting
on
his
bed
only
halfdressed
and
with
legs
dangling
over
the
edge
contemplating
a
host
of
garments
which
with
their
fringes
lace
embroidery
and
slashes
of
illassorted
hues
were
strewed
all
over
the
floor
porthos
sad
and
reflective
as
la
fontaines
hare
did
not
observe
dartagnans
entrance
which
was
moreover
screened
at
this
moment
by
m
mouston
whose
personal
corpulency
quite
enough
at
any
time
to
hide
one
man
from
another
was
effectually
doubled
by
a
scarlet
coat
which
the
intendant
was
holding
up
for
his
masters
inspection
by
the
sleeves
that
he
might
the
better
see
it
all
over
dartagnan
stopped
at
the
threshold
and
looked
in
at
the
pensive
porthos
and
then
as
the
sight
of
the
innumerable
garments
strewing
the
floor
caused
mighty
sighs
to
heave
the
bosom
of
that
excellent
gentleman
dartagnan
thought
it
time
to
put
an
end
to
these
dismal
reflections
and
coughed
by
way
of
announcing
himself
ah
exclaimed
porthos
whose
countenance
brightened
with
joy
ah
ah
here
is
dartagnan
i
shall
then
get
hold
of
an
idea
at
these
words
mouston
doubting
what
was
going
on
behind
him
got
out
of
the
way
smiling
kindly
at
the
friend
of
his
master
who
thus
found
himself
freed
from
the
material
obstacle
which
had
prevented
his
reaching
dartagnan
porthos
made
his
sturdy
knees
crack
again
in
rising
and
crossing
the
room
in
two
strides
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
friend
whom
he
folded
to
his
breast
with
a
force
of
affection
that
seemed
to
increase
with
every
day
ah
he
repeated
you
are
always
welcome
dear
friend
but
just
now
you
are
more
welcome
than
ever
but
you
seem
to
have
the
megrims
here
exclaimed
dartagnan
porthos
replied
by
a
look
expressive
of
dejection
well
then
tell
me
all
about
it
porthos
my
friend
unless
it
is
a
secret
in
the
first
place
returned
porthos
you
know
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
this
then
is
what
saddens
me
wait
a
minute
porthos
let
me
first
get
rid
of
all
this
litter
of
satin
and
velvet
oh
never
mind
said
porthos
contemptuously
it
is
all
trash
trash
porthos
cloth
at
twentyfive
livres
an
ell
gorgeous
satin
regal
velvet
then
you
think
these
clothes
are
splendid
porthos
splendid
ill
wager
that
you
alone
in
france
have
so
many
and
suppose
you
never
had
any
more
made
and
were
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
of
age
which
wouldnt
astonish
me
in
the
very
least
you
could
still
wear
a
new
dress
the
day
of
your
death
without
being
obliged
to
see
the
nose
of
a
single
tailor
from
now
till
then
porthos
shook
his
head
come
my
friend
said
dartagnan
this
unnatural
melancholy
in
you
frightens
me
my
dear
porthos
pray
get
it
out
then
and
the
sooner
the
better
yes
my
friend
so
i
will
if
indeed
it
is
possible
perhaps
you
have
received
bad
news
from
bracieux
no
they
have
felled
the
wood
and
it
has
yielded
a
third
more
than
the
estimate
then
there
has
been
a
fallingoff
in
the
pools
of
pierrefonds
no
my
friend
they
have
been
fished
and
there
is
enough
left
to
stock
all
the
pools
in
the
neighborhood
perhaps
your
estate
at
vallon
has
been
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
no
my
friend
on
the
contrary
the
ground
was
struck
with
lightning
a
hundred
paces
from
the
chateau
and
a
fountain
sprung
up
in
a
place
entirely
destitute
of
water
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
then
the
fact
is
i
have
received
an
invitation
for
the
fete
at
vaux
said
porthos
with
a
lugubrious
expression
well
do
you
complain
of
that
the
king
has
caused
a
hundred
mortal
heartburnings
among
the
courtiers
by
refusing
invitations
and
so
my
dear
friend
you
are
really
going
to
vaux
indeed
i
am
you
will
see
a
magnificent
sight
alas
i
doubt
it
though
everything
that
is
grand
in
france
will
be
brought
together
there
ah
cried
porthos
tearing
out
a
lock
of
hair
in
his
despair
eh
good
heavens
are
you
ill
cried
dartagnan
i
am
as
firm
as
the
pontneuf
it
isnt
that
but
what
is
it
then
tis
that
i
have
no
clothes
dartagnan
stood
petrified
no
clothes
porthos
no
clothes
he
cried
when
i
see
at
least
fifty
suits
on
the
floor
fifty
truly
but
not
one
which
fits
me
what
not
one
that
fits
you
but
are
you
not
measured
then
when
you
give
an
order
to
be
sure
he
is
answered
mouston
but
unfortunately
i
have
gotten
stouter
what
you
stouter
so
much
so
that
i
am
now
bigger
than
the
baron
would
you
believe
it
monsieur
parbleu
it
seems
to
me
that
is
quite
evident
do
you
see
stupid
said
porthos
that
is
quite
evident
be
still
my
dear
porthos
resumed
dartagnan
becoming
slightly
impatient
i
dont
understand
why
your
clothes
should
not
fit
you
because
mouston
has
grown
stouter
i
am
going
to
explain
it
said
porthos
you
remember
having
related
to
me
the
story
of
the
roman
general
antony
who
had
always
seven
wild
boars
kept
roasting
each
cooked
up
to
a
different
point
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
have
his
dinner
at
any
time
of
the
day
he
chose
to
ask
for
it
well
then
i
resolved
as
at
any
time
i
might
be
invited
to
court
to
spend
a
week
i
resolved
to
have
always
seven
suits
ready
for
the
occasion
capitally
reasoned
porthosonly
a
man
must
have
a
fortune
like
yours
to
gratify
such
whims
without
counting
the
time
lost
in
being
measured
the
fashions
are
always
changing
that
is
exactly
the
point
said
porthos
in
regard
to
which
i
flattered
myself
i
had
hit
on
a
very
ingenious
device
tell
me
what
it
is
for
i
dont
doubt
your
genius
you
remember
what
mouston
once
was
then
yes
when
he
used
to
call
himself
mousqueton
and
you
remember
too
the
period
when
he
began
to
grow
fatter
no
not
exactly
i
beg
your
pardon
my
good
mouston
oh
you
are
not
in
fault
monsieur
said
mouston
graciously
you
were
in
paris
and
as
for
us
we
were
at
pierrefonds
well
well
my
dear
porthos
there
was
a
time
when
mouston
began
to
grow
fat
is
that
what
you
wished
to
say
yes
my
friend
and
i
greatly
rejoice
over
the
period
indeed
i
believe
you
do
exclaimed
dartagnan
you
understand
continued
porthos
what
a
world
of
trouble
it
spared
for
me
no
i
dontby
any
means
look
here
my
friend
in
the
first
place
as
you
have
said
to
be
measured
is
a
loss
of
time
even
though
it
occur
only
once
a
fortnight
and
then
one
may
be
travelling
and
then
you
wish
to
have
seven
suits
always
with
you
in
short
i
have
a
horror
of
letting
any
one
take
my
measure
confound
it
either
one
is
a
nobleman
or
not
to
be
scrutinized
and
scanned
by
a
fellow
who
completely
analyzes
you
by
inch
and
linetis
degrading
here
they
find
you
too
hollow
there
too
prominent
they
recognize
your
strong
and
weak
points
see
now
when
we
leave
the
measurers
hands
we
are
like
those
strongholds
whose
angles
and
different
thicknesses
have
been
ascertained
by
a
spy
in
truth
my
dear
porthos
you
possess
ideas
entirely
original
ah
you
see
when
a
man
is
an
engineer
and
has
fortified
belleisletis
natural
my
friend
well
i
had
an
idea
which
would
doubtless
have
proved
a
good
one
but
for
moustons
carelessness
dartagnan
glanced
at
mouston
who
replied
by
a
slight
movement
of
his
body
as
if
to
say
you
will
see
whether
i
am
at
all
to
blame
in
all
this
i
congratulated
myself
then
resumed
porthos
at
seeing
mouston
get
fat
and
i
did
all
i
could
by
means
of
substantial
feeding
to
make
him
stoutalways
in
the
hope
that
he
would
come
to
equal
myself
in
girth
and
could
then
be
measured
in
my
stead
ah
cried
dartagnan
i
seethat
spared
you
both
time
and
humiliation
consider
my
joy
when
after
a
year
and
a
halfs
judicious
feedingfor
i
used
to
feed
him
up
myselfthe
fellow
oh
i
lent
a
good
hand
myself
monsieur
said
mouston
humbly
thats
true
consider
my
joy
when
one
morning
i
perceived
mouston
was
obliged
to
squeeze
in
as
i
once
did
myself
to
get
through
the
little
secret
door
that
those
fools
of
architects
had
made
in
the
chamber
of
the
late
madame
du
vallon
in
the
chateau
of
pierrefonds
and
by
the
way
about
that
door
my
friend
i
should
like
to
ask
you
who
know
everything
why
these
wretches
of
architects
who
ought
to
have
the
compasses
run
into
them
just
to
remind
them
came
to
make
doorways
through
which
nobody
but
thin
people
can
pass
oh
those
doors
answered
dartagnan
were
meant
for
gallants
and
they
have
generally
slight
and
slender
figures
madame
du
vallon
had
no
gallant
answered
porthos
majestically
perfectly
true
my
friend
resumed
dartagnan
but
the
architects
were
probably
making
their
calculations
on
a
basis
of
the
probability
of
your
marrying
again
ah
that
is
possible
said
porthos
and
now
i
have
received
an
explanation
of
how
it
is
that
doorways
are
made
too
narrow
let
us
return
to
the
subject
of
moustons
fatness
but
see
how
the
two
things
apply
to
each
other
i
have
always
noticed
that
peoples
ideas
run
parallel
and
so
observe
this
phenomenon
dartagnan
i
was
talking
to
you
of
mouston
who
is
fat
and
it
led
us
on
to
madame
du
vallon
who
was
thin
hum
is
it
not
marvelous
my
dear
friend
a
savant
of
my
acquaintance
m
costar
has
made
the
same
observation
as
you
have
and
he
calls
the
process
by
some
greek
name
which
i
forget
what
my
remark
is
not
then
original
cried
porthos
astounded
i
thought
i
was
the
discoverer
my
friend
the
fact
was
known
before
aristotles
daysthat
is
to
say
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
well
well
tis
no
less
true
said
porthos
delighted
at
the
idea
of
having
jumped
to
a
conclusion
so
closely
in
agreement
with
the
greatest
sages
of
antiquity
wonderfullybut
suppose
we
return
to
mouston
it
seems
to
me
we
have
left
him
fattening
under
our
very
eyes
yes
monsieur
said
mouston
well
said
porthos
mouston
fattened
so
well
that
he
gratified
all
my
hopes
by
reaching
my
standard
a
fact
of
which
i
was
well
able
to
convince
myself
by
seeing
the
rascal
one
day
in
a
waistcoat
of
mine
which
he
had
turned
into
a
coata
waistcoat
the
mere
embroidery
of
which
was
worth
a
hundred
pistoles
twas
only
to
try
it
on
monsieur
said
mouston
from
that
moment
i
determined
to
put
mouston
in
communication
with
my
tailors
and
to
have
him
measured
instead
of
myself
a
capital
idea
porthos
but
mouston
is
a
foot
and
a
half
shorter
than
you
exactly
they
measured
him
down
to
the
ground
and
the
end
of
the
skirt
came
just
below
my
knee
what
a
marvelous
man
you
are
porthos
such
a
thing
could
happen
only
to
you
ah
yes
pay
your
compliments
you
have
ample
grounds
to
go
upon
it
was
exactly
at
that
timethat
is
to
say
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
agothat
i
set
out
for
belleisle
instructing
mouston
so
as
always
to
have
in
every
event
a
pattern
of
every
fashion
to
have
a
coat
made
for
himself
every
month
and
did
mouston
neglect
complying
with
your
instructions
ah
that
was
anything
but
right
mouston
no
monsieur
quite
the
contrary
quite
the
contrary
no
he
never
forgot
to
have
his
coats
made
but
he
forgot
to
inform
me
that
he
had
got
stouter
but
it
was
not
my
fault
monsieur
your
tailor
never
told
me
and
this
to
such
an
extent
monsieur
continued
porthos
that
the
fellow
in
two
years
has
gained
eighteen
inches
in
girth
and
so
my
last
dozen
coats
are
all
too
large
from
a
foot
to
a
foot
and
a
half
but
the
rest
those
which
were
made
when
you
were
of
the
same
size
they
are
no
longer
the
fashion
my
dear
friend
were
i
to
put
them
on
i
should
look
like
a
fresh
arrival
from
siam
and
as
though
i
had
been
two
years
away
from
court
i
understand
your
difficulty
you
have
how
many
new
suits
nine
thirtysix
and
yet
not
one
to
wear
well
you
must
have
a
thirtyseventh
made
and
give
the
thirtysix
to
mouston
ah
monsieur
said
mouston
with
a
gratified
air
the
truth
is
that
monsieur
has
always
been
very
generous
to
me
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
hadnt
that
idea
or
that
i
was
deterred
by
the
expense
but
it
wants
only
two
days
to
the
fete
i
received
the
invitation
yesterday
made
mouston
post
hither
with
my
wardrobe
and
only
this
morning
discovered
my
misfortune
and
from
now
till
the
day
after
tomorrow
there
isnt
a
single
fashionable
tailor
who
will
undertake
to
make
me
a
suit
that
is
to
say
one
covered
all
over
with
gold
isnt
it
i
wish
it
so
undoubtedly
all
over
oh
we
shall
manage
it
you
wont
leave
for
three
days
the
invitations
are
for
wednesday
and
this
is
only
sunday
morning
tis
true
but
aramis
has
strongly
advised
me
to
be
at
vaux
twentyfour
hours
beforehand
how
aramis
yes
it
was
aramis
who
brought
me
the
invitation
ah
to
be
sure
i
see
you
are
invited
on
the
part
of
m
fouquet
by
no
means
by
the
king
dear
friend
the
letter
bears
the
following
as
large
as
life
m
le
baron
du
vallon
is
informed
that
the
king
has
condescended
to
place
him
on
the
invitation
list
very
good
but
you
leave
with
m
fouquet
and
when
i
think
cried
porthos
stamping
on
the
floor
when
i
think
i
shall
have
no
clothes
i
am
ready
to
burst
with
rage
i
should
like
to
strangle
somebody
or
smash
something
neither
strangle
anybody
nor
smash
anything
porthos
i
will
manage
it
all
put
on
one
of
your
thirtysix
suits
and
come
with
me
to
a
tailor
pooh
my
agent
has
seen
them
all
this
morning
even
m
percerin
who
is
m
percerin
oh
only
the
kings
tailor
oh
ah
yes
said
porthos
who
wished
to
appear
to
know
the
kings
tailor
but
now
heard
his
name
mentioned
for
the
first
time
to
m
percerins
by
jove
i
was
afraid
he
would
be
too
busy
doubtless
he
will
be
but
be
at
ease
porthos
he
will
do
for
me
what
he
wouldnt
do
for
another
only
you
must
allow
yourself
to
be
measured
ah
said
porthos
with
a
sigh
tis
vexatious
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
do
as
others
do
as
the
king
does
what
do
they
measure
the
king
too
does
he
put
up
with
it
the
king
is
a
beau
my
good
friend
and
so
are
you
too
whatever
you
may
say
about
it
porthos
smiled
triumphantly
let
us
go
to
the
kings
tailor
he
said
and
since
he
measures
the
king
i
think
by
my
faith
i
may
do
worse
than
allow
him
to
measure
me
chapter
iii
who
messire
jean
percerin
was
the
kings
tailor
messire
jean
percerin
occupied
a
rather
large
house
in
the
rue
st
honore
near
the
rue
de
larbre
sec
he
was
a
man
of
great
taste
in
elegant
stuffs
embroideries
and
velvets
being
hereditary
tailor
to
the
king
the
preferment
of
his
house
reached
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
charles
ix
from
whose
reign
dated
as
we
know
fancy
in
bravery
difficult
enough
to
gratify
the
percerin
of
that
period
was
a
huguenot
like
ambrose
pare
and
had
been
spared
by
the
queen
of
navarre
the
beautiful
margot
as
they
used
to
write
and
say
too
in
those
days
because
in
sooth
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
make
for
her
those
wonderful
ridinghabits
which
she
so
loved
to
wear
seeing
that
they
were
marvelously
well
suited
to
hide
certain
anatomical
defects
which
the
queen
of
navarre
used
very
studiously
to
conceal
percerin
being
saved
made
out
of
gratitude
some
beautiful
black
bodices
very
inexpensively
indeed
for
queen
catherine
who
ended
by
being
pleased
at
the
preservation
of
a
huguenot
people
on
whom
she
had
long
looked
with
detestation
but
percerin
was
a
very
prudent
man
and
having
heard
it
said
that
there
was
no
more
dangerous
sign
for
a
protestant
than
to
be
smiled
up
on
by
catherine
and
having
observed
that
her
smiles
were
more
frequent
than
usual
he
speedily
turned
catholic
with
all
his
family
and
having
thus
become
irreproachable
attained
the
lofty
position
of
master
tailor
to
the
crown
of
france
under
henry
iii
gay
king
as
he
was
this
position
was
as
grand
as
the
height
of
one
of
the
loftiest
peaks
of
the
cordilleras
now
percerin
had
been
a
clever
man
all
his
life
and
by
way
of
keeping
up
his
reputation
beyond
the
grave
took
very
good
care
not
to
make
a
bad
death
of
it
and
so
contrived
to
die
very
skillfully
and
that
at
the
very
moment
he
felt
his
powers
of
invention
declining
he
left
a
son
and
a
daughter
both
worthy
of
the
name
they
were
called
upon
to
bear
the
son
a
cutter
as
unerring
and
exact
as
the
square
rule
the
daughter
apt
at
embroidery
and
at
designing
ornaments
the
marriage
of
henry
iv
and
marie
de
medici
and
the
exquisite
courtmourning
for
the
aforementioned
queen
together
with
a
few
words
let
fall
by
m
de
bassompiere
king
of
the
beaux
of
the
period
made
the
fortune
of
the
second
generation
of
percerins
m
concino
concini
and
his
wife
galligai
who
subsequently
shone
at
the
french
court
sought
to
italianize
the
fashion
and
introduced
some
florentine
tailors
but
percerin
touched
to
the
quick
in
his
patriotism
and
his
selfesteem
entirely
defeated
these
foreigners
and
that
so
well
that
concino
was
the
first
to
give
up
his
compatriots
and
held
the
french
tailor
in
such
esteem
that
he
would
never
employ
any
other
and
thus
wore
a
doublet
of
his
on
the
very
day
that
vitry
blew
out
his
brains
with
a
pistol
at
the
pont
du
louvre
and
so
it
was
a
doublet
issuing
from
m
percerins
workshop
which
the
parisians
rejoiced
in
hacking
into
so
many
pieces
with
the
living
human
body
it
contained
notwithstanding
the
favor
concino
concini
had
shown
percerin
the
king
louis
xiii
had
the
generosity
to
bear
no
malice
to
his
tailor
and
to
retain
him
in
his
service
at
the
time
that
louis
the
just
afforded
this
great
example
of
equity
percerin
had
brought
up
two
sons
one
of
whom
made
his
debut
at
the
marriage
of
anne
of
austria
invented
that
admirable
spanish
costume
in
which
richelieu
danced
a
saraband
made
the
costumes
for
the
tragedy
of
mirame
and
stitched
on
to
buckinghams
mantle
those
famous
pearls
which
were
destined
to
be
scattered
about
the
pavements
of
the
louvre
a
man
becomes
easily
notable
who
has
made
the
dresses
of
a
duke

de
cinqmars
a
mademoiselle
ninon
a
m
de
beaufort
and
a
marion

and
thus
percerin

third
had
attained
the
summit
of
his
glory
when
his
father
died

old
famous
and
wealthy

further
dressed
louis
xiv
and
having
no
son
which
was
a
great
cause
of
sorrow
to
him
seeing
that
with
himself
his
dynasty
would
end
he
had
brought
up
several
hopeful
pupils
he
possessed
a

by
special
authority
from

as

was
and
versed
in

never
succeeded
in
fitting

this
is
beyond
explanation
it
is
a
matter
for
guessing
or
for
intuition
great
geniuses
of
every
kind
live
on
unseen
intangible
ideas
they
act
without
themselves
knowing
why
the
great
percerin
for
contrary
to
the
rule
of
dynasties
it
was
above
all
the
last
of
the
percerins
who
deserved
the
name
of
great
the
great
percerin
was
inspired
when
he
cut
a
robe
for
the
queen
or
a
coat
for
the
king
he
could
mount
a
mantle
for
monsieur
the
clock
of
a
stocking
for
madame
but
in
spite
of
his
supreme
talent
he
could
never
hit
off
anything
approaching
a
creditable
fit
for
m
colbert
that
man
he
used
often
to
say
is
beyond
my
art
my
needle
can
never
dot
him
down
we
need
scarcely
say
that
percerin
was
m
fouquets
tailor
and
that
the
superintendent
highly
esteemed
him
m
percerin
was
nearly
eighty
years
old
nevertheless
still
fresh
and
at
the
same
time
so
dry
the
courtiers
used
to
say
that
he
was
positively
brittle
his
renown
and
his
fortune
were
great
enough
for
m
le
prince
that
king
of
fops
to
take
his
arm
when
talking
over
the
fashions
and
for
those
least
eager
to
pay
never
to
dare
to
leave
their
accounts
in
arrear
with
him
for
master
percerin
would
for
the
first
time
make
clothes
upon
credit
but
the
second
never
unless
paid
for
the
former
order
it
is
easy
to
see
at
once
that
a
tailor
of
such
renown
instead
of
running
after
customers
made
difficulties
about
obliging
any
fresh
ones
and
so
percerin
declined
to
fit
bourgeois
or
those
who
had
but
recently
obtained
patents
of
nobility
a
story
used
to
circulate
that
even
m
de
mazarin
in
exchange
for
percerin
supplying
him
with
a
full
suit
of
ceremonial
vestments
as
cardinal
one
fine
day
slipped
letters
of
nobility
into
his
pocket
it
was
to
the
house
of
this
grand
llama
of
tailors
that
dartagnan
took
the
despairing
porthos
who
as
they
were
going
along
said
to
his
friend
take
care
my
good
dartagnan
not
to
compromise
the
dignity
of
a
man
such
as
i
am
with
the
arrogance
of
this
percerin
who
will
i
expect
be
very
impertinent
for
i
give
you
notice
my
friend
that
if
he
is
wanting
in
respect
i
will
infallibly
chastise
him
presented
by
me
replied
dartagnan
you
have
nothing
to
fear
even
though
you
were
what
you
are
not
ah
tis
because
what
have
you
anything
against
percerin
porthos
i
think
that
i
once
sent
mouston
to
a
fellow
of
that
name
and
then
the
fellow
refused
to
supply
me
oh
a
misunderstanding
no
doubt
which
it
will
be
now
exceedingly
easy
to
set
right
mouston
must
have
made
a
mistake
perhaps
he
has
confused
the
names
possibly
that
rascal
mouston
never
can
remember
names
i
will
take
it
all
upon
myself
very
good
stop
the
carriage
porthos
here
we
are
here
how
here
we
are
at
the
halles
and
you
told
me
the
house
was
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
larbre
sec
tis
true
but
look
well
i
do
look
and
i
see
what
pardieu
that
we
are
at
the
halles
you
do
not
i
suppose
want
our
horses
to
clamber
up
on
the
roof
of
the
carriage
in
front
of
us
no
nor
the
carriage
in
front
of
us
to
mount
on
top
of
the
one
in
front
of
it
nor
that
the
second
should
be
driven
over
the
roofs
of
the
thirty
or
forty
others
which
have
arrived
before
us
no
you
are
right
indeed
what
a
number
of
people
and
what
are
they
all
about
tis
very
simple
they
are
waiting
their
turn
bah
have
the
comedians
of
the
hotel
de
bourgogne
shifted
their
quarters
no
their
turn
to
obtain
an
entrance
to
m
percerins
house
and
we
are
going
to
wait
too
oh
we
shall
show
ourselves
prompter
and
not
so
proud
what
are
we
to
do
then
get
down
pass
through
the
footmen
and
lackeys
and
enter
the
tailors
house
which
i
will
answer
for
our
doing
if
you
go
first
come
along
then
said
porthos
they
accordingly
alighted
and
made
their
way
on
foot
towards
the
establishment
the
cause
of
the
confusion
was
that
m
percerins
doors
were
closed
while
a
servant
standing
before
them
was
explaining
to
the
illustrious
customers
of
the
illustrious
tailor
that
just
then
m
percerin
could
not
receive
anybody
it
was
bruited
about
outside
still
on
the
authority
of
what
the
great
lackey
had
told
some
great
noble
whom
he
favored
in
confidence
that
m
percerin
was
engaged
on
five
costumes
for
the
king
and
that
owing
to
the
urgency
of
the
case
he
was
meditating
in
his
office
on
the
ornaments
colors
and
cut
of
these
five
suits
some
contented
with
this
reason
went
away
again
contented
to
repeat
the
tale
to
others
but
others
more
tenacious
insisted
on
having
the
doors
opened
and
among
these
last
three
blue
ribbons
intended
to
take
parts
in
a
ballet
which
would
inevitably
fail
unless
the
said
three
had
their
costumes
shaped
by
the
very
hand
of
the
great
percerin
himself
dartagnan
pushing
on
porthos
who
scattered
the
groups
of
people
right
and
left
succeeded
in
gaining
the
counter
behind
which
the
journeyman
tailors
were
doing
their
best
to
answer
queries
we
forgot
to
mention
that
at
the
door
they
wanted
to
put
off
porthos
like
the
rest
but
dartagnan
showing
himself
pronounced
merely
these
words
the
kings
order
and
was
let
in
with
his
friend
the
poor
fellows
had
enough
to
do
and
did
their
best
to
reply
to
the
demands
of
the
customers
in
the
absence
of
their
master
leaving
off
drawing
a
stitch
to
knit
a
sentence
and
when
wounded
pride
or
disappointed
expectation
brought
down
upon
them
too
cutting
a
rebuke
he
who
was
attacked
made
a
dive
and
disappeared
under
the
counter
the
line
of
discontented
lords
formed
a
truly
remarkable
picture
our
captain
of
musketeers
a
man
of
sure
and
rapid
observation
took
it
all
in
at
a
glance
and
having
run
over
the
groups
his
eye
rested
on
a
man
in
front
of
him
this
man
seated
upon
a
stool
scarcely
showed
his
head
above
the
counter
that
sheltered
him
he
was
about
forty
years
of
age
with
a
melancholy
aspect
pale
face
and
soft
luminous
eyes
he
was
looking
at
dartagnan
and
the
rest
with
his
chin
resting
upon
his
hand
like
a
calm
and
inquiring
amateur
only
on
perceiving
and
doubtless
recognizing
our
captain
he
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
it
was
this
action
perhaps
that
attracted
dartagnans
attention
if
so
the
gentleman
who
had
pulled
down
his
hat
produced
an
effect
entirely
different
from
what
he
had
desired
in
other
respects
his
costume
was
plain
and
his
hair
evenly
cut
enough
for
customers
who
were
not
close
observers
to
take
him
for
a
mere
tailors
apprentice
perched
behind
the
board
and
carefully
stitching
cloth
or
velvet
nevertheless
this
man
held
up
his
head
too
often
to
be
very
productively
employed
with
his
fingers
dartagnan
was
not
deceivednot
he
and
he
saw
at
once
that
if
this
man
was
working
at
anything
it
certainly
was
not
at
velvet
eh
said
he
addressing
this
man
and
so
you
have
become
a
tailors
boy
monsieur
moliere
hush
m
dartagnan
replied
the
man
softly
you
will
make
them
recognize
me
well
and
what
harm
the
fact
is
there
is
no
harm
but
you
were
going
to
say
there
is
no
good
in
doing
it
either
is
it
not
so
alas
no
for
i
was
occupied
in
examining
some
excellent
figures
go
ongo
on
monsieur
moliere
i
quite
understand
the
interest
you
take
in
the
platesi
will
not
disturb
your
studies
thank
you
but
on
one
condition
that
you
tell
me
where
m
percerin
really
is
oh
willingly
in
his
own
room
only
only
that
one
cant
enter
it
unapproachable
for
everybody
everybody
he
brought
me
here
so
that
i
might
be
at
my
ease
to
make
my
observations
and
then
he
went
away
well
my
dear
monsieur
moliere
but
you
will
go
and
tell
him
i
am
here
i
exclaimed
moliere
in
the
tone
of
a
courageous
dog
from
which
you
snatch
the
bone
it
has
legitimately
gained
i
disturb
myself
ah
monsieur
dartagnan
how
hard
you
are
upon
me
if
you
dont
go
directly
and
tell
m
percerin
that
i
am
here
my
dear
moliere
said
dartagnan
in
a
low
tone
i
warn
you
of
one
thing
that
i
wont
exhibit
to
you
the
friend
i
have
brought
with
me
moliere
indicated
porthos
by
an
imperceptible
gesture
this
gentleman
is
it
not
yes
moliere
fixed
upon
porthos
one
of
those
looks
which
penetrate
the
minds
and
hearts
of
men
the
subject
doubtless
appeared
a
very
promising
one
for
he
immediately
rose
and
led
the
way
into
the
adjoining
chamber
chapter
iv
the
patterns
during
all
this
time
the
noble
mob
was
slowly
heaving
away
leaving
at
every
angle
of
the
counter
either
a
murmur
or
a
menace
as
the
waves
leave
foam
or
scattered
seaweed
on
the
sands
when
they
retire
with
the
ebbing
tide
in
about
ten
minutes
moliere
reappeared
making
another
sign
to
dartagnan
from
under
the
hangings
the
latter
hurried
after
him
with
porthos
in
the
rear
and
after
threading
a
labyrinth
of
corridors
introduced
him
to
m
percerins
room
the
old
man
with
his
sleeves
turned
up
was
gathering
up
in
folds
a
piece
of
goldflowered
brocade
so
as
the
better
to
exhibit
its
luster
perceiving
dartagnan
he
put
the
silk
aside
and
came
to
meet
him
by
no
means
radiant
with
joy
and
by
no
means
courteous
but
take
it
altogether
in
a
tolerably
civil
manner
the
captain
of
the
kings
musketeers
will
excuse
me
i
am
sure
for
i
am
engaged
eh
yes
on
the
kings
costumes
i
know
that
my
dear
monsieur
percerin
you
are
making
three
they
tell
me
five
my
dear
sir
five
three
or
five
tis
all
the
same
to
me
my
dear
monsieur
and
i
know
that
you
will
make
them
most
exquisitely
yes
i
know
once
made
they
will
be
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
i
do
not
deny
it
but
that
they
may
be
the
most
beautiful
in
the
word
they
must
first
be
made
and
to
do
this
captain
i
am
pressed
for
time
oh
bah
there
are
two
days
yet
tis
much
more
than
you
require
monsieur
percerin
said
dartagnan
in
the
coolest
possible
manner
percerin
raised
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
little
accustomed
to
be
contradicted
even
in
his
whims
but
dartagnan
did
not
pay
the
least
attention
to
the
airs
which
the
illustrious
tailor
began
to
assume
my
dear
m
percerin
he
continued
i
bring
you
a
customer
ah
ah
exclaimed
percerin
crossly
m
le
baron
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
continued
dartagnan
percerin
attempted
a
bow
which
found
no
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
terrible
porthos
who
from
his
first
entry
into
the
room
had
been
regarding
the
tailor
askance
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
concluded
dartagnan
i
will
attend
to
monsieur
said
percerin
but
later
later
but
when
when
i
have
time
you
have
already
told
my
valet
as
much
broke
in
porthos
discontentedly
very
likely
said
percerin
i
am
nearly
always
pushed
for
time
my
friend
returned
porthos
sententiously
there
is
always
time
to
be
found
when
one
chooses
to
seek
it
percerin
turned
crimson
an
ominous
sign
indeed
in
old
men
blanched
by
age
monsieur
is
quite
at
liberty
to
confer
his
custom
elsewhere
come
come
percerin
interposed
dartagnan
you
are
not
in
a
good
temper
today
well
i
will
say
one
more
word
to
you
which
will
bring
you
on
your
knees
monsieur
is
not
only
a
friend
of
mine
but
more
a
friend
of
m
fouquets
ah
ah
exclaimed
the
tailor
that
is
another
thing
then
turning
to
porthos
monsieur
le
baron
is
attached
to
the
superintendent
he
inquired
i
am
attached
to
myself
shouted
porthos
at
the
very
moment
that
the
tapestry
was
raised
to
introduce
a
new
speaker
in
the
dialogue
moliere
was
all
observation
dartagnan
laughed
porthos
swore
my
dear
percerin
said
dartagnan
you
will
make
a
dress
for
the
baron
tis
i
who
ask
you
to
you
i
will
not
say
nay
captain
but
that
is
not
all
you
will
make
it
for
him
at
once
tis
impossible
within
eight
days
that
then
is
as
much
as
to
refuse
because
the
dress
is
wanted
for
the
fete
at
vaux
i
repeat
that
it
is
impossible
returned
the
obstinate
old
man
by
no
means
dear
monsieur
percerin
above
all
if
i
ask
you
said
a
mild
voice
at
the
door
a
silvery
voice
which
made
dartagnan
prick
up
his
ears
it
was
the
voice
of
aramis
monsieur
dherblay
cried
the
tailor
aramis
murmured
dartagnan
ah
our
bishop
said
porthos
good
morning
dartagnan
good
morning
porthos
goodmorning
my
dear
friends
said
aramis
come
come
m
percerin
make
the
barons
dress
and
i
will
answer
for
it
you
will
gratify
m
fouquet
and
he
accompanied
the
words
with
a
sign
which
seemed
to
say
agree
and
dismiss
them
it
appeared
that
aramis
had
over
master
percerin
an
influence
superior
even
to
dartagnans
for
the
tailor
bowed
in
assent
and
turning
round
upon
porthos
said
go
and
get
measured
on
the
other
side
porthos
colored
in
a
formidable
manner
dartagnan
saw
the
storm
coming
and
addressing
moliere
said
to
him
in
an
undertone
you
see
before
you
my
dear
monsieur
a
man
who
considers
himself
disgraced
if

the
flesh
and
bones

heaven
has
given
him

type
for
me
master
aristophanes
and
profit
by
it
moliere

no
need
of
encouragement
and
his
gaze
dwelt
long
and
keenly
on
the
baron
porthos
monsieur
he
said
if
you
will
come
with
me
i
will
make
them
take
your
measure
without
touching
you
oh
said
porthos
how
do
you
make
that
out
my
friend
i
say
that
they
shall
apply
neither
line
nor
rule
to
the
seams
of
your
dress
it
is
a
new
method
we
have
invented
for
measuring
people
of
quality
who
are
too
sensitive
to
allow
lowborn
fellows
to
touch
them
we
know
some
susceptible
persons
who
will
not
put
up
with
being
measured
a
process
which
as
i
think
wounds
the
natural
dignity
of
a
man
and
if
perchance
monsieur
should
be
one
of
these
corboeuf
i
believe
i
am
too
well
that
is
a
capital
and
most
consolatory
coincidence
and
you
shall
have
the
benefit
of
our
invention
but
how
in
the
world
can
it
be
done
asked
porthos
delighted
monsieur
said
moliere
bowing
if
you
will
deign
to
follow
me
you
will
see
aramis
observed
this
scene
with
all
his
eyes
perhaps
he
fancied
from
dartagnans
liveliness
that
he
would
leave
with
porthos
so
as
not
to
lose
the
conclusion
of
a
scene
well
begun
but
clearsighted
as
he
was
aramis
deceived
himself
porthos
and
moliere
left
together
dartagnan
remained
with
percerin
why
from
curiosity
doubtless
probably
to
enjoy
a
little
longer
the
society
of
his
good
friend
aramis
as
moliere
and
porthos
disappeared
dartagnan
drew
near
the
bishop
of
vannes
a
proceeding
which
appeared
particularly
to
disconcert
him
a
dress
for
you
also
is
it
not
my
friend
aramis
smiled
no
said
he
you
will
go
to
vaux
however
i
shall
go
but
without
a
new
dress
you
forget
dear
dartagnan
that
a
poor
bishop
of
vannes
is
not
rich
enough
to
have
new
dresses
for
every
fete
bah
said
the
musketeer
laughing
and
do
we
write
no
more
poems
now
either
oh
dartagnan
exclaimed
aramis
i
have
long
ago
given
up
all
such
tomfoolery
true
repeated
dartagnan
only
half
convinced
as
for
percerin
he
was
once
more
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
brocades
dont
you
perceive
said
aramis
smiling
that
we
are
greatly
boring
this
good
gentleman
my
dear
dartagnan
ah
ah
murmured
the
musketeer
aside
that
is
i
am
boring
you
my
friend
then
aloud
well
then
let
us
leave
i
have
no
further
business
here
and
if
you
are
as
disengaged
as
i
aramis
no
not
ii
wished
ah
you
had
something
particular
to
say
to
m
percerin
why
did
you
not
tell
me
so
at
once
something
particular
certainly
repeated
aramis
but
not
for
you
dartagnan
but
at
the
same
time
i
hope
you
will
believe
that
i
can
never
have
anything
so
particular
to
say
that
a
friend
like
you
may
not
hear
it
oh
no
no
i
am
going
said
dartagnan
imparting
to
his
voice
an
evident
tone
of
curiosity
for
aramiss
annoyance
well
dissembled
as
it
was
had
not
a
whit
escaped
him
and
he
knew
that
in
that
impenetrable
mind
every
thing
even
the
most
apparently
trivial
was
designed
to
some
end
an
unknown
one
but
an
end
that
from
the
knowledge
he
had
of
his
friends
character
the
musketeer
felt
must
be
important
on
his
part
aramis
saw
that
dartagnan
was
not
without
suspicion
and
pressed
him
stay
by
all
means
he
said
this
is
what
it
is
then
turning
towards
the
tailor
my
dear
percerin
said
hei
am
even
very
happy
that
you
are
here
dartagnan
oh
indeed
exclaimed
the
gascon
for
the
third
time
even
less
deceived
this
time
than
before
percerin
never
moved
aramis
roused
him
violently
by
snatching
from
his
hands
the
stuff
upon
which
he
was
engaged
my
dear
percerin
said
he
i
have
near
hand
m
lebrun
one
of
m
fouquets
painters
ah
very
good
thought
dartagnan
but
why
lebrun
aramis
looked
at
dartagnan
who
seemed
to
be
occupied
with
an
engraving
of
mark
antony
and
you
wish
that
i
should
make
him
a
dress
similar
to
those
of
the
epicureans
answered
percerin
and
while
saying
this
in
an
absent
manner
the
worthy
tailor
endeavored
to
recapture
his
piece
of
brocade
an
epicureans
dress
asked
dartagnan
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
i
see
said
aramis
with
a
most
engaging
smile
it
is
written
that
our
dear
dartagnan
shall
know
all
our
secrets
this
evening
yes
friend
you
have
surely
heard
speak
of
m
fouquets
epicureans
have
you
not
undoubtedly
is
it
not
a
kind
of
poetical
society
of
which
la
fontaine
loret
pelisson
and
moliere
are
members
and
which
holds
its
sittings
at
saintmande
exactly
so
well
we
are
going
to
put
our
poets
in
uniform
and
enroll
them
in
a
regiment
for
the
king
oh
very
well
i
understand
a
surprise
m
fouquet
is
getting
up
for
the
king
be
at
ease
if
that
is
the
secret
about
m
lebrun
i
will
not
mention
it
always
agreeable
my
friend
no
monsieur
lebrun
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
part
of
it
the
secret
which
concerns
him
is
far
more
important
than
the
other
then
if
it
is
so
important
as
all
that
i
prefer
not
to
know
it
said
dartagnan
making
a
show
of
departure
come
in
m
lebrun
come
in
said
aramis
opening
a
sidedoor
with
his
right
hand
and
holding
back
dartagnan
with
his
left
ifaith
i
too
am
quite
in
the
dark
quoth
percerin
aramis
took
an
opportunity
as
is
said
in
theatrical
matters
my
dear
m
de
percerin
aramis
continued
you
are
making
five
dresses
for
the
king
are
you
not
one
in
brocade
one
in
huntingcloth
one
in
velvet
one
in
satin
and
one
in
florentine
stuffs
yes
but
howdo
you
know
all
that
monseigneur
said
percerin
astounded
it
is
all
very
simple
my
dear
monsieur
there
will
be
a
hunt
a
banquet
concert
promenade
and
reception
these
five
kinds
of
dress
are
required
by
etiquette
you
know
everything
monseigneur
and
a
thing
or
two
in
addition
muttered
dartagnan
but
cried
the
tailor
in
triumph
what
you
do
not
know
monseigneurprince
of
the
church
though
you
arewhat
nobody
will
knowwhat
only
the
king
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
myself
do
know
is
the
color
of
the
materials
and
nature
of
the
ornaments
and
the
cut
the
ensemble
the
finish
of
it
all
well
said
aramis
that
is
precisely
what
i
have
come
to
ask
you
dear
percerin
ah
bah
exclaimed
the
tailor
terrified
though
aramis
had
pronounced
these
words
in
his
softest
and
most
honeyed
tones
the
request
appeared
on
reflection
so
exaggerated
so
ridiculous
so
monstrous
to
m
percerin
that
first
he
laughed
to
himself
then
aloud
and
finished
with
a
shout
dartagnan
followed
his
example
not
because
he
found
the
matter
so
very
funny
but
in
order
not
to
allow
aramis
to
cool
at
the
outset
i
appear
to
be
hazarding
an
absurd
question
do
i
not
said
aramis
but
dartagnan
who
is
incarnate
wisdom
itself
will
tell
you
that
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
ask
you
this
let
us
see
said
the
attentive
musketeer
perceiving
with
his
wonderful
instinct
that
they
had
only
been
skirmishing
till
now
and
that
the
hour
of
battle
was
approaching
let
us
see
said
percerin
incredulously
why
now
continued
aramis
does
m
fouquet
give
the
king
a
feteis
it
not
to
please
him
assuredly
said
percerin
dartagnan
nodded
assent
by
delicate
attentions
by
some
happy
device
by
a
succession
of
surprises
like
that
of
which
we
were
talkingthe
enrolment
of
our
epicureans
admirable
well
then
this
is
the
surprise
we
intend
m
lebrun
here
is
a
man
who
draws
most
excellently
yes
said
percerin
i
have
seen
his
pictures
and
observed
that
his
dresses
were
highly
elaborated
that
is
why
i
at
once
agreed
to
make
him
a
costumewhether
to
agree
with
those
of
the
epicureans
or
an
original
one
my
dear
monsieur
we
accept
your
offer
and
shall
presently
avail
ourselves
of
it
but
just
now
m
lebrun
is
not
in
want
of
the
dresses
you
will
make
for
himself
but
of
those
you
are
making
for
the
king
percerin
made
a
bound
backwards
which
dartagnancalmest
and
most
appreciative
of
men
did
not
consider
overdone
so
many
strange
and
startling
aspects
wore
the
proposal
which
aramis
had
just
hazarded
the
kings
dresses
give
the
kings
dresses
to
any
mortal
whatever
oh
for
once
monseigneur
your
grace
is
mad
cried
the
poor
tailor
in
extremity
help
me
now
dartagnan
said
aramis
more
and
more
calm
and
smiling
help
me
now
to
persuade
monsieur
for
you
understand
do
you
not
eh
ehnot
exactly
i
declare
what
you
do
not
understand
that
m
fouquet
wishes
to
afford
the
king
the
surprise
of
finding
his
portrait
on
his
arrival
at
vaux
and
that
the
portrait
which
be
a
striking
resemblance
ought
to
be
dressed
exactly
as
the
king
will
be
on
the
day
it
is
shown
oh
yes
yes
said
the
musketeer
nearly
convinced
so
plausible
was
this
reasoning
yes
my
dear
aramis
you
are
right
it
is
a
happy
idea
i
will
wager
it
is
one
of
your
own
aramis
well
i
dont
know
replied
the
bishop
either
mine
or
m
fouquets
then
scanning
percerin
after
noticing
dartagnans
hesitation
well
monsieur
percerin
he
asked
what
do
you
say
to
this
i
say
that
that
you
are
doubtless
free
to
refuse
i
know
welland
i
by
no
means
count
upon
compelling
you
my
dear
monsieur
i
will
say
more
i
even
understand
all
the
delicacy
you
feel
in
taking
up
with
m
fouquets
idea
you
dread
appearing
to
flatter
the
king
a
noble
spirit
m
percerin
a
noble
spirit
the
tailor
stammered
it
would
indeed
be
a
very
pretty
compliment
to
pay
the
young
prince
continued
aramis
but
as
the
surintendant
told
me
if
percerin
refuse
tell
him
that
it
will
not
at
all
lower
him
in
my
opinion
and
i
shall
always
esteem
him
only
only
repeated
percerin
rather
troubled
only
continued
aramis
i
shall
be
compelled
to
say
to
the
kingyou
understand
my
dear
monsieur
percerin
that
these
are
m
fouquets
wordsi
shall
be
constrained
to
say
to
the
king
sire
i
had
intended
to
present
your
majesty
with
your
portrait
but
owing
to
a
feeling
of
delicacy
slightly
exaggerated
perhaps
although
creditable
m
percerin
opposed
the
project
opposed
cried
the
tailor
terrified
at
the
responsibility
which
would
weigh
upon
him
i
to
oppose
the
desire
the
will
of
m
fouquet
when
he
is
seeking
to
please
the
king
oh
what
a
hateful
word
you
have
uttered
monseigneur
oppose
oh
tis
not
i
who
said
it
heaven
have
mercy
on
me
i
call
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
to
witness
it
is
it
not
true
monsieur
dartagnan
that
i
have
opposed
nothing
dartagnan
made
a
sign
indicating
that
he
wished
to
remain
neutral
he
felt
that
there
was
an
intrigue
at
the
bottom
of
it
whether
comedy
or
tragedy
he
was
at
his
wits
end
at
not
being
able
to
fathom
it
but
in
the
meanwhile
wished
to
keep
clear
but
already
percerin
goaded
by
the
idea
that
the
king
was
to
be
told
he
stood
in
the
way
of
a
pleasant
surprise
had
offered
lebrun
a
chair
and
proceeded
to
bring
from
a
wardrobe
four
magnificent
dresses
the
fifth
being
still
in
the
workmens
hands
and
these
masterpieces
he
successively
fitted
upon
four
lay
figures
which
imported
into
france
in
the
time
of
concini
had
been
given
to
percerin
ii
by
marshal
donore
after
the
discomfiture
of
the
italian
tailors
ruined
in
their
competition
the
painter
set
to
work
to
draw
and
then
to
paint
the
dresses
but
aramis
who
was
closely
watching
all
the
phases
of
his
toil
suddenly
stopped
him
i
think
you
have
not
quite
got
it
my
dear
lebrun
he
said
your
colors
will
deceive
you
and
on
canvas
we
shall
lack
that
exact
resemblance
which
is
absolutely
requisite
time
is
necessary
for
attentively
observing
the
finer
shades
quite
true
said
percerin
but
time
is
wanting
and
on
that
head
you
will
agree
with
me
monseigneur
i
can
do
nothing
then
the
affair
will
fail
said
aramis
quietly
and
that
because
of
a
want
of
precision
in
the
colors
nevertheless
lebrun
went
on
copying
the
materials
and
ornaments
with
the
closest
fidelitya
process
which
aramis
watched
with
illconcealed
impatience
what
in
the
world
now
is
the
meaning
of
this
imbroglio
the
musketeer
kept
saying
to
himself
that
will
never
do
said
aramis
m
lebrun
close
your
box
and
roll
up
your
canvas
but
monsieur
cried
the
vexed
painter
the
light
is
abominable
here
an
idea
m
lebrun
an
idea
if
we
had
a
pattern
of
the
materials
for
example
and
with
time
and
a
better
light
oh
then
cried
lebrun
i
would
answer
for
the
effect
good
said
dartagnan
this
ought
to
be
the
knotty
point
of
the
whole
thing
they
want
a
pattern
of
each
of
the
materials
mordioux
will
this
percerin
give
in
now
percerin
beaten
from
his
last
retreat
and
duped
moreover
by
the
feigned
goodnature
of
aramis
cut
out
five
patterns
and
handed
them
to
the
bishop
of
vannes
i
like
this
better
that
is
your
opinion
is
it
not
said
aramis
to
dartagnan
my
dear
aramis
said
dartagnan
my
opinion
is
that
you
are
always
the
same
and
consequently
always
your
friend
said
the
bishop
in
a
charming
tone
yes
yes
said
dartagnan
aloud
then
in
a
low
voice
if
i
am
your
dupe
double
jesuit
that
you
are
i
will
not
be
your
accomplice
and
to
prevent
it
tis
time
i
left
this
placeadieu
aramis
he
added
aloud
adieu
i
am
going
to
rejoin
porthos
then
wait
for
me
said
aramis
pocketing
the
patterns
for
i
have
done
and
shall
be
glad
to
say
a
parting
word
to
our
dear
old
friend
lebrun
packed
up
his
paints
and
brushes
percerin
put
back
the
dresses
into
the
closet
aramis
put
his
hand
on
his
pocket
to
assure
himself
the
patterns
were
secureand
they
all
left
the
study
chapter
v
where
probably
moliere
obtained
his
first
idea
of
the
bourgeois
gentilhomme
dartagnan
found
porthos
in
the
adjoining
chamber
but
no
longer
an
irritated
porthos
or
a
disappointed
porthos
but
porthos
radiant
blooming
fascinating
and
chattering
with
moliere
who
was
looking
upon
him
with
a
species
of
idolatry
and
as
a
man
would
who
had
not
only
never
seen
anything
greater
but
not
even
ever
anything
so
great
aramis
went
straight
up
to
porthos
and
offered
him
his
white
hand
which
lost
itself
in
the
gigantic
clasp
of
his
old
friendan
operation
which
aramis
never
hazarded
without
a
certain
uneasiness
but
the
friendly
pressure
having
been
performed
not
too
painfully
for
him
the
bishop
of
vannes
passed
over
to
moliere
well
monsieur
said
he
will
you
come
with
me
to
saintmande
i
will
go
anywhere
you
like
monseigneur
answered
moliere
to
saintmande
cried
porthos
surprised
at
seeing
the
proud
bishop
of
vannes
fraternizing
with
a
journeyman
tailor
what
aramis
are
you
going
to
take
this
gentleman
to
saintmande
yes
said
aramis
smiling
our
work
is
pressing
and
besides
my
dear
porthos
continued
dartagnan
m
moliere
is
not
altogether
what
he
seems
in
what
way
asked
porthos
why
this
gentleman
is
one
of
m
percerins
chief
clerks
and
is
expected
at
saintmande
to
try
on
the
dresses
which
m
fouquet
has
ordered
for
the
epicureans
tis
precisely
so
said
moliere
yes
monsieur
come
then
my
dear
m
moliere
said
aramis
that
is
if
you
have
done
with
m
du
vallon
we
have
finished
replied
porthos
and
you
are
satisfied
asked
dartagnan
completely
so
replied
porthos
moliere
took
his
leave
of
porthos
with
much
ceremony
and
grasped
the
hand
which
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
furtively
offered
him
pray
monsieur
concluded
porthos
mincingly
above
all
be
exact
you
will
have
your
dress
the
day
after
tomorrow
monsieur
le
baron
answered
moliere
and
he
left
with
aramis
then
dartagnan
taking
porthoss
arm
what
has
this
tailor
done
for
you
my
dear
porthos
he
asked
that
you
are
so
pleased
with
him
what
has
he
done
for
me
my
friend
done
for
me
cried
porthos
enthusiastically
yes
i
ask
you
what
has
he
done
for
you
my
friend
he
has
done
that
which
no
tailor
ever
yet
accomplished
he
has
taken
my
measure
without
touching
me
ah
bah
tell
me
how
he
did
it
first
then
they
went
i
dont
know
where
for
a
number
of
lay
figures
of
all
heights
and
sizes
hoping
there
would
be
one
to
suit
mine
but
the
largestthat
of
the
drummajor
of
the
swiss
guardwas
two
inches
too
short
and
a
half
foot
too
narrow
in
the
chest
indeed
it
is
exactly
as
i
tell
you
dartagnan
but
he
is
a
great
man
or
at
the
very
least
a
great
tailor
is
this
m
moliere
he
was
not
at
all
put
at
fault
by
the
circumstance
what
did
he
do
then
oh
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
ifaith
tis
an
unheardof
thing
that
people
should
have
been
so
stupid
as
not
to
have
discovered
this
method
from
the
first
what
annoyance
and
humiliation
they
would
have
spared
me
not
to
mention
of
the
costumes
my
dear
porthos
yes
thirty
dresses
well
my
dear
porthos
come
tell
me
m
molieres
plan
moliere
you
call
him
so
do
you
i
shall
make
a
point
of
recollecting
his
name
yes
or
poquelin
if
you
prefer
that
no
i
like
moliere
best
when
i
wish
to
recollect
his
name
i
shall
think
of
voliere
an
aviary
and
as
i
have
one
at
pierrefonds
capital
returned
dartagnan
and
m
molieres
plan
tis
this
instead
of
pulling
me
to
pieces
as
all
these
rascals
doof
making
me
bend
my
back
and
double
my
jointsall
of
them
low
and
dishonorable
practices
dartagnan
made
a
sign
of
approbation
with
his
head
monsieur
he
said
to
me
continued
porthos
a
gentleman
ought
to
measure
himself
do
me
the
pleasure
to
draw
near
this
glass
and
i
drew
near
the
glass
i
must
own
i
did
not
exactly
understand
what
this
good
m
voliere
wanted
with
me
moliere
ah
yes
molieremoliere
and
as
the
fear
of
being
measured
still
possessed
me
take
care
said
i
to
him
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
me
i
am
very
ticklish
i
warn
you
but
he
with
his
soft
voice
for
he
is
a
courteous
fellow
we
must
admit
my
friend
he
with
his
soft
voice
monsieur
said
he
that
your
dress
may
fit
you
well
it
must
be
made
according
to
your
figure
your
figure
is
exactly
reflected
in
this
mirror
we
shall
take
the
measure
of
this
reflection
in
fact
said
dartagnan
you
saw
yourself
in
the
glass
but
where
did
they
find
one
in
which
you
could
see
your
whole
figure
my
good
friend
it
is
the
very
glass
in
which
the
king
is
used
to
look
to
see
himself
yes
but
the
king
is
a
foot
and
a
half
shorter
than
you
are
ah
well
i
know
not
how
that
may
be
it
is
no
doubt
a
cunning
way
of
flattering
the
king
but
the
lookingglass
was
too
large
for
me
tis
true
that
its
height
was
made
up
of
three
venetian
plates
of
glass
placed
one
above
another
and
its
breadth
of
three
similar
parallelograms
in
juxtaposition
oh
porthos
what
excellent
words
you
have
command
of
where
in
the
word
did
you
acquire
such
a
voluminous
vocabulary
at
belleisle
aramis
and
i
had
to
use
such
words
in
our
strategic
studies
and
castramentative
experiments
dartagnan
recoiled
as
though
the
sesquipedalian
syllables
had
knocked
the
breath
out
of
his
body
ah
very
good
let
us
return
to
the
lookingglass
my
friend
then
this
good
m
voliere
moliere
yesmoliereyou
are
right
you
will
see
now
my
dear
friend
that
i
shall
recollect
his
name
quite
well
this
excellent
m
moliere
set
to
work
tracing
out
lines
on
the
mirror
with
a
piece
of
spanish
chalk
following
in
all
the
make
of
my
arms
and
my
shoulders
all
the
while
expounding
this
maxim
which
i
thought
admirable
it
is
advisable
that
a
dress
should
not
incommode
its
wearer
in
reality
said
dartagnan
that
is
an
excellent
maxim
which
is
unfortunately
seldom
carried
out
in
practice
that
is
why
i
found
it
all
the
more
astonishing
when
he
expatiated
upon
it
ah
he
expatiated
parbleu
let
me
hear
his
theory
seeing
that
he
continued
one
may
in
awkward
circumstances
or
in
a
troublesome
position
have
ones
doublet
on
ones
shoulder
and
not
desire
to
take
ones
doublet
off
true
said
dartagnan
and
so
continued
m
voliere
moliere
moliere
yes
and
so
went
on
m
moliere
you
want
to
draw
your
sword
monsieur
and
you
have
your
doublet
on
your
back
what
do
you
do
i
take
it
off
i
answered
well
no
he
replied
how
no
i
say
that
the
dress
should
be
so
well
made
that
it
will
in
no
way
encumber
you
even
in
drawing
your
sword
ah
ah
throw
yourself
on
guard
pursued
he
i
did
it
with
such
wondrous
firmness
that
two
panes
of
glass
burst
out
of
the
window
tis
nothing
nothing
said
he
keep
your
position
i
raised
my
left
arm
in
the
air
the
forearm
gracefully
bent
the
ruffle
drooping
and
my
wrist
curved
while
my
right
arm
half
extended
securely
covered
my
wrist
with
the
elbow
and
my
breast
with
the
wrist
yes
said
dartagnan
tis
the
true
guardthe
academic
guard
you
have
said
the
very
word
dear
friend
in
the
meanwhile
voliere
moliere
hold
i
should
certainly
after
all
prefer
to
call
himwhat
did
you
say
his
other
name
was
poquelin
i
prefer
to
call
him
poquelin
and
how
will
you
remember
this
name
better
than
the
other
you
understand
he
calls
himself
poquelin
does
he
not
yes
if
i
were
to
call
to
mind
madame
coquenard
good
and
change
coc
into
poc
nard
into
lin
and
instead
of
coquenard
i
shall
have
poquelin
tis
wonderful
cried
dartagnan
astounded
go
on
my
friend
i
am
listening
to
you
with
admiration
this
coquelin
sketched
my
arm
on
the
glass
i
beg
your
pardonpoquelin
what
did
i
say
then
you
said
coquelin
ah
true
this
poquelin
then
sketched
my
arm
on
the
glass
but
he
took
his
time
over
it
he
kept
looking
at
me
a
good
deal
the
fact
is
that
i
must
have
been
looking
particularly
handsome
does
it
weary
you
he
asked
a
little
i
replied
bending
a
little
in
my
hands
but
i
could
hold
out
for
an
hour
or
so
longer
no
no
i
will
not
allow
it
the
willing
fellows
will
make
it
a
duty
to
support
your
arms
as
of
old
men
supported
those
of
the
prophet
very
good
i
answered
that
will
not
be
humiliating
to
you
my
friend
said
i
there
is
i
think
a
great
difference
between
being
supported
and
being
measured
the
distinction
is
full
of
the
soundest
sense
interrupted
dartagnan
then
continued
porthos
he
made
a
sign
two
lads
approached
one
supported
my
left
arm
while
the
other
with
infinite
address
supported
my
right
another
my
man
cried
he
a
third
approached
support
monsieur
by
the
waist
said
he
the
garcon
complied
so
that
you
were
at
rest
asked
dartagnan
perfectly
and
pocquenard
drew
me
on
the
glass
poquelin
my
friend
poquelinyou
are
right
stay
decidedly
i
prefer
calling
him
voliere
yes
and
then
it
was
over
wasnt
it
during
that
time
voliere
drew
me
as
i
appeared
in
the
mirror
twas
delicate
in
him
i
much
like
the
plan
it
is
respectful
and
keeps
every
one
in
his
place
and
there
it
ended
without
a
soul
having
touched
me
my
friend
except
the
three
garcons
who
supported
you
doubtless
but
i
have
i
think
already
explained
to
you
the
difference
there
is
between
supporting
and
measuring
tis
true
answered
dartagnan
who
said
afterwards
to
himself
ifaith
i
greatly
deceive
myself
or
i
have
been
the
means
of
a
good
windfall
to
that
rascal
moliere
and
we
shall
assuredly
see
the
scene
hit
off
to
the
life
in
some
comedy
or
other
porthos
smiled
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
dartagnan
must
i
confess
well
i
was
laughing
over
my
good
fortune
oh
that
is
true
i
dont
know
a
happier
man
than
you
but
what
is
this
last
piece
of
luck
that
has
befallen
you
well
my
dear
fellow
congratulate
me
i
desire
nothing
better
it
seems
that
i
am
the
first
who
has
had
his
measure
taken
in
that
manner
are
you
so
sure
of
it
nearly
so
certain
signs
of
intelligence
which
passed
between
voliere
and
the
other
garcons
showed
me
the
fact
well
my
friend
that
does
not
surprise
me
from
moliere
said
dartagnan
voliere
my
friend
oh
no
no
indeed
i
am
very
willing
to
leave
you
to
go
on
saying
voliere
but
as
for
me
i
shall
continued
to
say
moliere
well
this
i
was
saying
does
not
surprise
me
coming
from
moliere
who
is
a
very
ingenious
fellow
and
inspired
you
with
this
grand
idea
it
will
be
of
great
use
to
him
by
and
by
i
am
sure
wont
it
be
of
use
to
him
indeed
i
believe
you
it
will
and
that
in
the
highest
degreefor
you
see
my
friend
moliere
is
of
all
known
tailors
the
man
who
best

barons

which

quitted

and
rejoined
their
carriages

will
leave

annoyed
at

to

in
no
very
good
humor
moliere
on
the

quite
delighted
at
having
made
such
a
capital
rough
sketch
and
at
knowing
where
to
find
his
original
again

he
should
desire
to
convert
his
sketch

of
moods

in

louis

during
the

at

his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
was
engaged
in
drawing
out
the
plan
of
the
prologue
to
the
facheux
a
comedy
in

was
to
be

on
the

by

of

was
composing
an
account
of
the
fetes
at
vaux
before
those
fetes
had
taken
place
la
fontaine
sauntered
about
from
one
to
the
other
a
peripatetic
absentminded
boring
unbearable
dreamer
who
kept
buzzing
and
humming
at
everybodys
elbow
a
thousand
poetic
abstractions
he
so
often
disturbed
pelisson
that
the
latter
raising
his
head
crossly
said
at
least
la
fontaine
supply
me
with
a
rhyme
since
you
have
the
run
of
the
gardens
at
parnassus
what
rhyme
do
you
want
asked
the
fabler
as
madame
de
sevigne
used
to
call
him
i
want
a
rhyme
to
lumiere
orniere
answered
la
fontaine
ah
but
my
good
friend
one
cannot
talk
of
wheelruts
when
celebrating
the
delights
of
vaux
said
loret
besides
it
doesnt
rhyme
answered
pelisson
what
doesnt
rhyme
cried
la
fontaine
in
surprise
yes
you
have
an
abominable
habit
my
frienda
habit
which
will
ever
prevent
your
becoming
a
poet
of
the
first
order
you
rhyme
in
a
slovenly
manner
oh
oh
you
think
so
do
you
pelisson
yes
i
do
indeed
remember
that
a
rhyme
is
never
good
so
long
as
one
can
find
a
better
then
i
will
never
write
anything
again
save
in
prose
said
la
fontaine
who
had
taken
up
pelissons
reproach
in
earnest
ah
i
often
suspected
i
was
nothing
but
a
rascally
poet
yes
tis
the
very
truth
do
not
say
so
your
remark
is
too
sweeping
and
there
is
much
that
is
good
in
your
fables
and
to
begin
continued
la
fontaine
following
up
his
idea
i
will
go
and
burn
a
hundred
verses
i
have
just
made
where
are
your
verses
in
my
head
well
if
they
are
in
your
head
you
cannot
burn
them
true
said
la
fontaine
but
if
i
do
not
burn
them
well
what
will
happen
if
you
do
not
burn
them
they
will
remain
in
my
mind
and
i
shall
never
forget
them
the
deuce
cried
loret
what
a
dangerous
thing
one
would
go
mad
with
it
the
deuce
the
deuce
repeated
la
fontaine
what
can
i
do
i
have
discovered
the
way
said
moliere
who
had
entered
just
at
this
point
of
the
conversation
what
way
write
them
first
and
burn
them
afterwards
how
simple
well
i
should
never
have
discovered
that
what
a
mind
that
devil
of
a
moliere
has
said
la
fontaine
then
striking
his
forehead
oh
thou
wilt
never
be
aught
but
an
ass
jean
la
fontaine
he
added
what
are
you
saying
there
my
friend
broke
in
moliere
approaching
the
poet
whose
aside
he
had
heard
i
say
i
shall
never
be
aught
but
an
ass
answered
la
fontaine
with
a
heavy
sigh
and
swimming
eyes
yes
my
friend
he
added
with
increasing
grief
it
seems
that
i
rhyme
in
a
slovenly
manner
oh
tis
wrong
to
say
so
nay
i
am
a
poor
creature
who
said
so
parbleu
twas
pelisson
did
you
not
pelisson
pelisson
again
absorbed
in
his
work
took
good
care
not
to
answer
but
if
pelisson
said
you
were
so
cried
moliere
pelisson
has
seriously
offended
you
do
you
think
so
ah
i
advise
you
as
you
are
a
gentleman
not
to
leave
an
insult
like
that
unpunished
what
exclaimed
la
fontaine
did
you
ever
fight
once
only
with
a
lieutenant
in
the
light
horse
what
wrong
had
he
done
you
it
seems
he
ran
away
with
my
wife
ah
ah
said
moliere
becoming
slightly
pale
but
as
at
la
fontaines
declaration
the
others
had
turned
round
moliere
kept
upon
his
lips
the
rallying
smile
which
had
so
nearly
died
away
and
continuing
to
make
la
fontaine
speak
and
what
was
the
result
of
the
duel
the
result
was
that
on
the
ground
my
opponent
disarmed
me
and
then
made
an
apology
promising
never
again
to
set
foot
in
my
house
and
you
considered
yourself
satisfied
said
moliere
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
picked
up
my
sword
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
i
said
i
have
not
fought
you
because
you
were
my
wifes
friend
but
because
i
was
told
i
ought
to
fight
so
as
i
have
never
known
any
peace
save
since
you
made
her
acquaintance
do
me
the
pleasure
to
continue
your
visits
as
heretofore
or
morbleu
let
us
set
to
again
and
so
continued
la
fontaine
he
was
compelled
to
resume
his
friendship
with
madame
and
i
continue
to
be
the
happiest
of
husbands
all
burst
out
laughing
moliere
alone
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
why
perhaps
to
wipe
away
a
tear
perhaps
to
smother
a
sigh
alas
we
know
that
moliere
was
a
moralist
but
he
was
not
a
philosopher
tis
all
one
he
said
returning
to
the
topic
of
the
conversation
pelisson
has
insulted
you
ah
truly
i
had
already
forgotten
it
and
i
am
going
to
challenge
him
on
your
behalf
well
you
can
do
so
if
you
think
it
indispensable
i
do
think
it
indispensable
and
i
am
going
to
stay
exclaimed
la
fontaine
i
want
your
advice
upon
what
this
insult
no
tell
me
really
now
whether
lumiere
does
not
rhyme
with
orniere
i
should
make
them
rhyme
ah
i
knew
you
would
and
i
have
made
a
hundred
thousand
such
rhymes
in
my
time
a
hundred
thousand
cried
la
fontaine
four
times
as
many
as
la
pucelle
which
m
chaplain
is
meditating
is
it
also
on
this
subject
too
that
you
have
composed
a
hundred
thousand
verses
listen
to
me
you
eternally
absentminded
creature
said
moliere
it
is
certain
continued
la
fontaine
that
legume
for
instance
rhymes
with
posthume
in
the
plural
above
all
yes
above
all
in
the
plural
seeing
that
then
it
rhymes
not
with
three
letters
but
with
four
as
orniere
does
with
lumiere
but
give
me
ornieres
and
lumieres
in
the
plural
my
dear
pelisson
said
la
fontaine
clapping
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
his
friend
whose
insult
he
had
quite
forgotten
and
they
will
rhyme
hem
coughed
pelisson
moliere
says
so
and
moliere
is
a
judge
of
such
things
he
declares
he
has
himself
made
a
hundred
thousand
verses
come
said
moliere
laughing
he
is
off
now
it
is
like
rivage
which
rhymes
admirably
with
herbage
i
would
take
my
oath
of
it
but
said
moliere
i
tell
you
all
this
continued
la
fontaine
because
you
are
preparing
a
divertissement
for
vaux
are
you
not
yes
the
facheux
ah
yes
the
facheux
yes
i
recollect
well
i
was
thinking
a
prologue
would
admirably
suit
your
divertissement
doubtless
it
would
suit
capitally
ah
you
are
of
my
opinion
so
much
so
that
i
have
asked
you
to
write
this
very
prologue
you
asked
me
to
write
it
yes
you
and
on
your
refusal
begged
you
to
ask
pelisson
who
is
engaged
upon
it
at
this
moment
ah
that
is
what
pelisson
is
doing
then
ifaith
my
dear
moliere
you
are
indeed
often
right
when
when
you
call
me
absentminded
it
is
a
monstrous
defect
i
will
cure
myself
of
it
and
do
your
prologue
for
you
but
inasmuch
as
pelisson
is
about
it
ah
true
miserable
rascal
that
i
am
loret
was
indeed
right
in
saying
i
was
a
poor
creature
it
was
not
loret
who
said
so
my
friend
well
then
whoever
said
so
tis
the
same
to
me
and
so
your
divertissement
is
called
the
facheux
well
can
you
make
heureux
rhyme
with
facheux
if
obliged
yes
and
even
with
capriceux
oh
no
no
it
would
be
hazardous
and
yet
why
so
there
is
too
great
a
difference
in
the
cadences
i
was
fancying
said
la
fontaine
leaving
moliere
for
loreti
was
fancying
what
were
you
fancying
said
loret
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
make
haste
you
are
writing
the
prologue
to
the
facheux
are
you
not
no
mordieu
it
is
pelisson
ah
pelisson
cried
la
fontaine
going
over
to
him
i
was
fancying
he
continued
that
the
nymph
of
vaux
ah
beautiful
cried
loret
the
nymph
of
vaux
thank
you
la
fontaine
you
have
just
given
me
the
two
concluding
verses
of
my
paper
well
if
you
can
rhyme
so
well
la
fontaine
said
pelisson
tell
me
now
in
what
way
you
would
begin
my
prologue
i
should
say
for
instance
oh
nymph
who
after
who
i
should
place
a
verb
in
the
second
person
singular
of
the
present
indicative
and
should
go
on
thus
this
grot
profound
but
the
verb
the
verb
asked
pelisson
to
admire
the
greatest
king
of
all
kings
round
continued
la
fontaine
but
the
verb
the
verb
obstinately
insisted
pelisson
this
second
person
singular
of
the
present
indicative
well
then
quittest
oh
nymph
who
quittest
now
this
grot
profound
to
admire
the
greatest
king
of
all
kings
round
you
would
not
put
who
quittest
would
you
why
not
quittest
after
you
who
ah
my
dear
fellow
exclaimed
la
fontaine
you
are
a
shocking
pedant
without
counting
said
moliere
that
the
second
verse
king
of
all
kings
round
is
very
weak
my
dear
la
fontaine
then
you
see
clearly
i
am
nothing
but
a
poor
creaturea
shuffler
as
you
said
i
never
said
so
then
as
loret
said
and
it
was
not
loret
either
it
was
pelisson
well
pelisson
was
right
a
hundred
times
over
but
what
annoys
me
more
than
anything
my
dear
moliere
is
that
i
fear
we
shall
not
have
our
epicurean
dresses
you
expected
yours
then
for
the
fete
yes
for
the
fete
and
then
for
after
the
fete
my
housekeeper
told
me
that
my
own
is
rather
faded
diable
your
housekeeper
is
right
rather
more
than
faded
ah
you
see
resumed
la
fontaine
the
fact
is
i
left
it
on
the
floor
in
my
room
and
my
cat
well
your
cat
she
made
her
nest
upon
it
which
has
rather
changed
its
color
moliere
burst
out
laughing
pelisson
and
loret
followed
his
example
at
this
juncture
the
bishop
of
vannes
appeared
with
a
roll
of
plans
and
parchments
under
his
arm
as
if
the
angel
of
death
had
chilled
all
gay
and
sprightly
fanciesas
if
that
wan
form
had
scared
away
the
graces
to
whom
xenocrates
sacrificedsilence
immediately
reigned
through
the
study
and
every
one
resumed
his
selfpossession
and
his
pen
aramis
distributed
the
notes
of
invitation
and
thanked
them
in
the
name
of
m
fouquet
the
superintendent
he
said
being
kept
to
his
room
by
business
could
not
come
and
see
them
but
begged
them
to
send
him
some
of
the
fruits
of
their
days
work
to
enable
him
to
forget
the
fatigue
of
his
labor
in
the
night
at
these
words
all
settled
down
to
work
la
fontaine
placed
himself
at
a
table
and
set
his
rapid
pen
an
endless
dance
across
the
smooth
white
vellum
pelisson
made
a
fair
copy
of
his
prologue
moliere
contributed
fifty
fresh
verses
with
which
his
visit
to
percerin
had
inspired
him
loret
an
article
on
the
marvelous
fetes
he
predicted
and
aramis
laden
with
his
booty
like
the
king
of
the
bees
that
great
black
drone
decked
with
purple
and
gold
reentered
his
apartment
silent
and
busy
but
before
departing
remember
gentlemen
said
he
we
leave
tomorrow
evening
in
that
case
i
must
give
notice
at
home
said
moliere
yes
poor
moliere
said
loret
smiling
he
loves
his
home
he
loves
yes
replied
moliere
with
his
sad
sweet
smile
he
loves
that
does
not
mean
they
love
him
as
for
me
said
la
fontaine
they
love
me
at
chateau
thierry
i
am
very
sure
aramis
here
reentered
after
a
brief
disappearance
will
any
one
go
with
me
he
asked
i
am
going
by
paris
after
having
passed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
m
fouquet
i
offer
my
carriage
good
said
moliere
i
accept
it
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
shall
dine
here
said
loret
m
de
gourville
has
promised
me
some
crawfish
he
has
promised
me
some
whitings
find
a
rhyme
for
that
la
fontaine
aramis
went
out
laughing
as
only
he
could
laugh
and
moliere
followed
him
they
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
when
la
fontaine
opened
the
door
and
shouted
out
he
has
promised
us
some
whitings
in
return
for
these
our
writings
the
shouts
of
laughter
reached
the
ears
of
fouquet
at
the
moment
aramis
opened
the
door
of
the
study
as
to
moliere
he
had
undertaken
to
order
the
horses
while
aramis
went
to
exchange
a
parting
word
with
the
superintendent
oh
how
they
are
laughing
there
said
fouquet
with
a
sigh
do
you
not
laugh
monseigneur
i
laugh
no
longer
now
m
dherblay
the
fete
is
approaching
money
is
departing
have
i
not
told
you
that
was
my
business
yes
you
promised
me
millions
you
shall
have
them
the
day
after
the
kings
entree
into
vaux
fouquet
looked
closely
at
aramis
and
passed
the
back
of
his
icy
hand
across
his
moistened
brow
aramis
perceived
that
the
superintendent
either
doubted
him
or
felt
he
was
powerless
to
obtain
the
money
how
could
fouquet
suppose
that
a
poor
bishop
exabbe
exmusketeer
could
find
any
why
doubt
me
said
aramis
fouquet
smiled
and
shook
his
head
man
of
little
faith
added
the
bishop
my
dear
m
dherblay
answered
fouquet
if
i
fall
well
if
you
fall
i
shall
at
least
fall
from
such
a
height
that
i
shall
shatter
myself
in
falling
then
giving
himself
a
shake
as
though
to
escape
from
himself
whence
came
you
said
he
my
friend
from
parisfrom
percerin
and
what
have
you
been
doing
at
percerins
for
i
suppose
you
attach
no
great
importance
to
our
poets
dresses
no
i
went
to
prepare
a
surprise
surprise
yes
which
you
are
going
to
give
to
the
king
and
will
it
cost
much
oh
a
hundred
pistoles
you
will
give
lebrun
a
paintingah
all
the
better
and
what
is
this
painting
to
represent
i
will
tell
you
then
at
the
same
time
whatever
you
may
say
or
think
of
it
i
went
to
see
the
dresses
for
our
poets
bah
and
they
will
be
rich
and
elegant
splendid
there
will
be
few
great
monseigneurs
with
so
good
people
will
see
the
difference
there
is
between
the
courtiers
of
wealth
and
those
of
friendship
ever
generous
and
grateful
dear
prelate
in
your
school
fouquet
grasped
his
hand
and
where
are
you
going
he
said
i
am
off
to
paris
when
you
shall
have
given
a
certain
letter
for
whom
m

made
against

for

it
is
too

you

and
you
never
told
me
twas
only
yesterday
his
mother

to
me

the
woman

deepest
misery

said
fouquet
sometimes
bears
with
such
injustice
on
earth
that
i
hardly
wonder
there
are
wretches
who
doubt
of
its
existence
stay
m
dherblay
and
fouquet
taking
a
pen
wrote
a
few
rapid
lines
to
his
colleague
lyonne
aramis
took
the
letter
and
made
ready
to
go
wait
said
fouquet
he
opened
his
drawer
and
took
out
ten
government
notes
which
were
there
each
for
a
thousand
francs
stay
he
said
set
the
son
at
liberty
and
give
this
to
the
mother
but
above
all
do
not
tell
her
what
monseigneur
that
she
is

would

will
bless
those
who
are
mindful
of
his
poor
so
also
do
i
pray
replied
aramis
kissing
fouquets
hand
and
he
went
out
quickly
carrying
off
the
letter
for
lyonne
and
the
notes
for
seldons
mother

vii
another
supper
at
the
bastile
seven
oclock
sounded
from
the
great
clock
of
the
bastile
that
famous
clock
which
like
all
the
accessories
of
the
state
prison
the
very
use
of
which
is
a
torture
recalled
to
the
prisoners
minds
the
destination
of
every
hour
of
their
punishment
the
timepiece
of
the
bastile
adorned
with
figures
like
most
of
the
clocks
of
the
period
represented
st
peter
in
bonds
it
was
the
supper
hour
of
the
unfortunate
captives
the
doors
grating
on
their
enormous
hinges
opened
for
the
passage
of
the
baskets
and
trays
of
provisions
the
abundance
and
the
delicacy
of
which
as
m
de
baisemeaux
has
himself
taught
us
was
regulated
by
the
condition
in
life
of
the
prisoner
we
understand
on
this
head
the
theories
of
m
de
baisemeaux
sovereign
dispenser
of
gastronomic
delicacies
head
cook
of
the
royal
fortress
whose
trays
fullladen
were
ascending
the
steep
staircases
carrying
some
consolation
to
the
prisoners
in
the
shape
of
honestly
filled
bottles
of
good
vintages
this
same
hour
was
that
of
m
le
gouverneurs
supper
also
he
had
a
guest
today
and
the
spit
turned
more
heavily
than
usual
roast
partridges
flanked
with
quails
and
flanking
a
larded
leveret
boiled
fowls

fried
and
sprinkled
with
white

cardons
of

together
with
soups

governors
bill
of
fare
baisemeaux
seated
at
table
was
rubbing
his
hands
and
looking
at
the
bishop
of
vannes
who
booted
like
a
cavalier
dressed
in
gray
and
sword
at
side
kept
talking
of
his
hunger
and
testifying
the
liveliest
impatience
m
de
baisemeaux
de
montlezun
was
not
accustomed
to
the
unbending
movements
of
his
greatness
my
lord
of
vannes
and
this
evening
aramis
becoming
sprightly
volunteered
confidence
on
confidence
the
prelate
had
again
a
little
touch
of
the
musketeer
about
him
the
bishop
just
trenched
on
the
borders
only
of
license
in
his
style
of
conversation
as
for
m
de
baisemeaux
with
the
facility
of
vulgar
people
he
gave
himself
up
entirely
upon
this
point
of
his
guests
freedom
monsieur
said
he
for
indeed
tonight
i
dare
not
call
you
monseigneur
by
no
means
said
aramis
call
me
monsieur
i
am
booted
do
you
know
monsieur
of
whom
you
remind
me
this
evening
no
faith
said
aramis
taking
up
his
glass
but
i
hope
i
remind
you
of
a
capital
guest
you
remind
me
of
two
monsieur
francois
shut
the
window
the
wind
may
annoy
his
greatness
and
let
him
go
added
aramis
the
supper
is
completely
served
and
we
shall
eat
it
very
well
without
waiters
i
like
exceedingly
to
be
teteatete
when
i
am
with
a
friend
baisemeaux
bowed
respectfully
i
like
exceedingly
continued
aramis
to
help
myself
retire
francois
cried
baisemeaux
i
was
saying
that
your
greatness
puts
me
in
mind
of
two
persons
one
very
illustrious
the
late
cardinal
the
great
cardinal
de
la
rochelle
who
wore
boots
like
you
indeed
said
aramis
and
the
other
the
other
was
a
certain
musketeer
very
handsome
very
brave
very
adventurous
very
fortunate
who
from
being
abbe
turned
musketeer
and
from
musketeer
turned
abbe
aramis
condescended
to
smile
from
abbe
continued
baisemeaux
encouraged
by
aramiss
smilefrom
abbe
bishopand
from
bishop
ah
stay
there
i
beg
exclaimed
aramis
i
have
just
said
monsieur
that
you
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
cardinal
enough
dear
m
baisemeaux
as
you
said
i
have
on
the
boots
of
a
cavalier
but
i
do
not
intend
for
all
that
to
embroil
myself
with
the
church
this
evening
but
you
have
wicked
intentions
nevertheless
monseigneur
oh
yes
wicked
i
own
as
everything
mundane
is
you
traverse
the
town
and
the
streets
in
disguise
in
disguise
as
you
say
and
you
still
make
use
of
your
sword
yes
i
should
think
so
but
only
when
i
am
compelled
do
me
the
pleasure
to
summon
francois
have
you
no
wine
there
tis
not
for
wine
but
because
it
is
hot
here
and
the
window
is
shut
i
shut
the
windows
at
suppertime
so
as
not
to
hear
the
sounds
or
the
arrival
of
couriers
ah
yes
you
hear
them
when
the
window
is
open
but
too
well
and
that
disturbs
me
you
understand
nevertheless
i
am
suffocated
francois
francois
entered
open
the
windows
i
pray
you
master
francois
said
aramis
you
will
allow
him
dear
m
baisemeaux
you
are
at
home
here
answered
the
governor
the
window
was
opened
do
you
not
think
said
m
de
baisemeaux
that
you
will
find
yourself
very
lonely
now
m
de
la
fere
has
returned
to
his
household
gods
at
blois
he
is
a

old
friend
is
he
not
you
know
it
as
i
do
baisemeaux
seeing
that
you
were
in
the
musketeers
with
us
bah
with
my
friends
i
reckon
neither
bottles
of
wine
nor
years
and
you
are
right
but
i
do
more
than
love
m
de
la
fere
dear
baisemeaux
i
venerate
him
well
for
my
part
though
tis
singular
said
the
governor
i
prefer
m
dartagnan
to
him
there
is
a
man
for
you
who
drinks
long
and
well
that
kind
of
people
allow
you
at
least
to
penetrate
their
thoughts
baisemeaux
make
me
tipsy
tonight
let
us
have
a
merry
time
of
it
as
of
old
and
if
i
have
a
trouble
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
promise
you
you
shall
see
it
as
you
would
a
diamond
at
the
bottom
of
your
glass
bravo
said
baisemeaux
and
he
poured
out
a
great
glass
of
wine
and
drank
it
off
at
a
draught
trembling
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
being
by
hook
or
by
crook
in
the
secret
of
some
high
archiepiscopal
misdemeanor
while
he
was
drinking
he
did
not
see
with
what
attention
aramis
was
noting
the
sounds
in
the
great
court
a
courier
came
in
about
eight
oclock
as
francois
brought
in
the
fifth
bottle
and
although
the
courier
made
a
great
noise
baisemeaux
heard
nothing
the
devil
take
him
said
aramis
what
who
asked
baisemeaux
i
hope
tis
neither
the
wine
you
drank
nor
he
who
is
the
cause
of
your
drinking
it
no
it
is
a
horse
who
is
making
noise
enough
in
the
court
for
a
whole
squadron
pooh
some
courier
or
other
replied
the
governor
redoubling
his
attention
to
the
passing
bottle
yes
and
may
the
devil
take
him
and
so
quickly
that
we
shall
never
hear
him
speak
more
hurrah
hurrah
you
forget
me
baisemeaux
my
glass
is
empty
said
aramis
lifting
his
dazzling
venetian
goblet
upon
my
honor
you
delight
me
francois
wine
francois
entered
wine
fellow
and
better
yes
monsieur
yes
but
a
courier
has
just
arrived
let
him
go
to
the
devil
i
say
yes
monsieur
but
let
him
leave
his
news
at
the
office
we
will
see
to
it
tomorrow
tomorrow
there
will
be
time
tomorrow
there
will
be
daylight
said
baisemeaux
chanting
the
words
ah
monsieur
grumbled
the
soldier
francois
in
spite
of
himself
monsieur
take
care
said
aramis
take
care
of
what
dear
m
dherblay
said
baisemeaux
half
intoxicated
the
letter
which
the
courier
brings
to
the
governor
of
a
fortress
is
sometimes
an
order
nearly
always
do
not
orders
issue
from
the
ministers
yes
undoubtedly
but
and
what
to
these
ministers
do
but
countersign
the
signature
of
the
king
perhaps
you
are
right
nevertheless
tis
very
tiresome
when
you
are
sitting
before
a
good
table
teteatete
with
a
friendah
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
i
forgot
it
is
i
who
engage
you
at
supper
and
that
i
speak
to
a
future
cardinal
let
us
pass
over
that
dear
baisemeaux
and
return
to
our
soldier
to
francois
well
and
what
has
francois
done
he
has
demurred
he
was
wrong
then
however
he
has
demurred
you
see
tis
because
there
is
something
extraordinary
in
this
matter
it
is
very
possible
that
it
was
not
francois
who
was
wrong
in
demurring
but
you
who
are
in
the
wrong
in
not
listening
to
him
wrong
i
to
be
wrong
before
francois
that
seems
rather
hard
pardon
me
merely
an
irregularity
but
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
make
an
observation
which
i
deem
important
oh
perhaps
you
are
right
stammered
baisemeaux
the
kings
order
is
sacred
but
as
to
orders
that
arrive
when
one
is
at
supper
i
repeat
that
the
devil
if
you
had
said
as
much
to
the
great
cardinalhem
my
dear
baisemeaux
and
if
his
order
had
any
importance
i
do
it
that
i
may
not
disturb
a
bishop
mordioux
am
i
not
then
excusable
do
not
forget
baisemeaux
that
i
have
worn
the
soldiers
coat
and
i
am
accustomed
to
obedience
everywhere
you
wish
then
i
wish
that
you
would
do
your
duty
my
friend
yes
at
least
before
this
soldier
tis
mathematically
true
exclaimed
baisemeaux
francois
still
waited
let
them
send
this
order
of
the
kings
up
to
me
he
repeated
recovering
himself
and
he
added
in
a
low
tone
do
you
know
what
it
is
i
will
tell
you
something
about
as
interesting
as
this
beware
of
fire
near
the
powder
magazine
or
look
close
after
such
and
such
a
one
who
is
clever
at
escaping
ah
if
you
only
knew
monseigneur
how
many
times
i
have
been
suddenly
awakened
from
the
very
sweetest
deepest
slumber
by
messengers
arriving
at
full
gallop
to
tell
me
or
rather
bring
me
a
slip
of
paper
containing
these
words
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
what
news
tis
clear
enough
that
those
who
waste
their
time
writing
such
orders
have
never
slept
in
the
bastile
they
would
know
better
they
have
never
considered
the
thickness
of
my
walls
the
vigilance
of
my
officers
the
number
of
rounds
we
go
but
indeed
what
can
you
expect
monseigneur
it
is
their
business
to
write
and
torment
me
when
i
am
at
rest
and
to
trouble
me
when
i
am
happy
added
baisemeaux
bowing
to
aramis
then
let
them
do
their
business
and
do
you
do
yours
added
the
bishop
smiling
francois
reentered
baisemeaux
took
from
his
hands
the
ministers
order
he
slowly
undid
it
and
as
slowly
read
it
aramis
pretended
to
be
drinking
so
as
to
be
able
to
watch
his
host
through
the
glass
then
baisemeaux
having
read
it
what
was
i
just
saying
he
exclaimed
what
is
it
asked
the
bishop
an
order
of
release
there
now
excellent
news
indeed
to
disturb
us
excellent
news
for
him
whom
it
concerns
you
will
at
least
agree
my
dear
governor
and
at
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
it
is
charitable
oh
charity
is
all
very
well
but
it
is
for
that
fellow
who
says
he
is
so
weary
and
tired
but
not
for
me
who
am
amusing
myself
said
baisemeaux
exasperated
will
you
lose
by
him
then
and
is
the
prisoner
who
is
to
be
set
at
liberty
a
good
payer
oh
yes
indeed
a
miserable
fivefranc
rat
let
me
see
it
asked
m
dherblay
it
is
no
indiscretion
by
no
means
read
it
there
is
urgent
on
the
paper
you
have
seen
that
i
suppose
oh
admirable
urgenta
man
who
has
been
there
ten
years
it
is
urgent
to
set
him
free
today
this
very
evening
at
eight
oclockurgent
and
baisemeaux
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
supreme
disdain
flung
the
order
on
the
table
and
began
eating
again
they
are
fond
of
these
tricks
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
they
seize
a
man
some
fine
day
keep
him
under
lock
and
key
for
ten
years
and
write
to
you
watch
this
fellow
well
or
keep
him
very
strictly
and
then
as
soon
as
you
are
accustomed
to
look
upon
the
prisoner
as
a
dangerous
man
all
of
a
sudden
without
rhyme
or
reason
they
writeset
him
at
liberty
and
actually
add
to
their
missiveurgent
you
will
own
my
lord
tis
enough
to
make
a
man
at
dinner
shrug
his
shoulders
what
do
you
expect
it
is
for
them
to
write
said
aramis
for
you
to
execute
the
order
good
good
execute
it
oh
patience
you
must
not
imagine
that
i
am
a
slave
gracious
heaven
my
very
good
m
baisemeaux
who
ever
said
so
your
independence
is
well
known
thank
heaven
but
your
goodness
of
heart
is
also
known
ah
dont
speak
of
it
and
your
obedience
to
your
superiors
once
a
soldier
you
see
baisemeaux
always
a
soldier
and
i
shall
directly
obey
and
tomorrow
morning
at
daybreak
the
prisoner
referred
to
shall
be
set
free
tomorrow
at
dawn
why
not
this
evening
seeing
that
the
lettre
de
cachet
bears
both
on
the
direction
and
inside
urgent
because
this
evening
we
are
at
supper
and
our
affairs
are
urgent
too
dear
baisemeaux
booted
though
i
be
i
feel
myself
a
priest
and
charity
has
higher
claims
upon
me
than
hunger
and
thirst
this
unfortunate
man
has
suffered
long
enough
since
you
have
just
told
me
that
he
has
been
your
prisoner
these
ten
years
abridge
his
suffering
his
good
time
has
come
give
him
the
benefit
quickly
god
will
repay
you
in
paradise
with
years
of
felicity
you
wish
it
i
entreat
you
what
in
the
very
middle
of
our
repast
i
implore
you
such
an
action
is
worth
ten
benedicites
it
shall
be
as
you
desire
only
our
supper
will
get
cold
oh
never
heed
that
baisemeaux
leaned
back
to
ring
for
francois
and
by
a
very
natural
motion
turned
round
towards
the
door
the
order
had
remained
on
the
table
aramis
seized
the
opportunity
when
baisemeaux
was
not
looking
to
change
the
paper
for
another
folded
in
the
same
manner
which
he
drew
swiftly
from
his
pocket
francois
said
the
governor
let
the
major
come
up
here
with
the
turnkeys
of
the
bertaudiere
francois
bowed
and
quitted
the
room
leaving
the
two
companions
alone
chapter
viii
the
general
of
the
order
there
was
now
a
brief
silence
during
which
aramis
never
removed
his
eyes
from
baisemeaux
for
a
moment
the
latter
seemed
only
half
decided
to
disturb
himself
thus
in
the
middle
of
supper
and
it
was
clear
he
was
trying
to
invent
some
pretext
whether
good
or
bad
for
delay
at
any
rate
till
after
dessert
and
it
appeared
also
that
he
had
hit
upon
an
excuse
at
last
eh
but
it
is
impossible
he
cried
how
impossible
said
aramis
give
me
a
glimpse
of
this
impossibility
tis
impossible
to
set
a
prisoner
at
liberty
at
such
an
hour
where
can
he
go
to
a
man
so
unacquainted
with
paris
he
will
find
a
place
wherever
he
can
you
see
now
one
might
as
well
set
a
blind
man
free
i
have
a
carriage
and
will
take
him
wherever
he
wishes
you
have
an
answer
for
everything
francois
tell
monsieur
le
major
to
go
and
open
the
cell
of
m
seldon
no
3
bertaudiere
seldon
exclaimed
aramis
very
naturally
you
said
seldon
i
think
i
said
seldon
of
course
tis
the
name
of
the
man
they
set
free
oh
you
mean
to
say
marchiali
said
aramis
marchiali
oh
yes
indeed
no
no
seldon
i
think
you
are
making
a
mistake
monsieur
baisemeaux
i
have
read
the
order
and
i
also
and
i
saw
seldon
in
letters
as
large
as
that
and
baisemeaux
held
up
his
finger
and
i
read
marchiali
in
characters
as
large
as
this
said
aramis
also
holding
up
two
fingers
to
the
proof
let
us
throw
a
light
on
the
matter
said
baisemeaux
confident
he
was
right
there
is
the
paper
you
have
only
to
read
it
i
read
marchiali
returned
aramis
spreading
out
the
paper
look
baisemeaux
looked
and
his
arms
dropped
suddenly
yes
yes
he
said
quite
overwhelmed
yes
marchiali
tis
plainly
written
marchiali
quite
true
ah
how
the
man
of
whom
we
have
talked
so
much
the
man
whom
they
are
every
day
telling
me
to
take
such
care
of
there
is
marchiali
repeated
the
inflexible
aramis
i
must
own
it
monseigneur
but
i
understand
nothing
about
it
you
believe
your
eyes
at
any
rate
to
tell
me
very
plainly
there
is
marchiali
and
in
a
good
handwriting
too
tis
a
wonder
i
still
see
this
order
and
the
name
of
seldon
irishman
i
see
it
ah
i
even
recollect
that
under
this
name
there
was
a
blot
of
ink
no
there
is
no
ink
no
there
is
no
blot
oh
but
there
was
though
i
know
it
because
i
rubbed
my
fingerthis
very
onein
the
powder
that
was
over
the
blot
in
a
word
be
it
how
it
may
dear
m
baisemeaux
said
aramis
and
whatever
you
may
have
seen
the
order
is
signed
to
release
marchiali
blot
or
no
blot
the
order
is
signed
to
release
marchiali
replied
baisemeaux
mechanically
endeavoring
to
regain
his
courage
and
you
are
going
to
release
this
prisoner
if
your
heart
dictates
you
to
deliver
seldon
also
i
declare
to
you
i
will
not
oppose
it
the
least
in
the
world
aramis
accompanied
this
remark
with
a
smile
the
irony
of
which
effectually
dispelled
baisemeauxs
confusion
of
mind
and
restored
his
courage
monseigneur
he
said
this
marchiali
is
the
very
same
prisoner
whom
the
other
day
a
priest
confessor
of
our
order
came
to
visit
in
so
imperious
and
so
secret
a
manner
i
dont
know
that
monsieur
replied
the
bishop
tis
no
such
long
time
ago
dear
monsieur
dherblay
it
is
true
but
with
us
monsieur
it
is
good
that
the
man
of
today
should
no
longer
know
what
the
man
of
yesterday
did
in
any
case
said
baisemeaux
the
visit
of
the
jesuit
confessor
must
have
given
happiness
to
this
man
aramis
made
no
reply
but
recommenced
eating
and
drinking
as
for
baisemeaux
no
longer
touching
anything
that
was
on
the
table
he
again
took
up
the
order
and
examined
it
every
way
this
investigation
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
made
the
ears
of
the
impatient
aramis
burn
with
anger
but
the
bishop
of
vannes
did
not
become
incensed
for
so
little
above
all
when
he
had
murmured
to
himself
that
to
do
so
was
dangerous
are
you
going
to
release
marchiali
he
said
what
mellow
fragrant
and
delicious
sherry
this
is
my
dear
governor
monseigneur
replied
baisemeaux
i
shall
release
the
prisoner
marchiali
when
i
have
summoned
the
courier
who
brought
the
order
and
above
all
when
by
interrogating
him
i
have
satisfied
myself
the
order
is
sealed
and
the
courier
is
ignorant
of
the
contents
what
do
you
want
to
satisfy
yourself
about
be
it
so
monseigneur
but
i
shall
send
to
the
ministry
and
m
de
lyonne
will
either
confirm
or
withdraw
the
order
what
is
the
good
of
all
that
asked
aramis
coldly
what
good
yes
what
is
your
object
i
ask
the
object
of
never
deceiving
oneself
monseigneur
nor
being
wanting
in
the
respect
which
a
subaltern
owes
to
his
superior
officers
nor
infringing
the
duties
of
a
service
one
has
accepted
of
ones
own
free
will
very
good
you
have
just
spoken
so
eloquently
that
i
cannot
but
admire
you
it
is
true
that
a
subaltern
owes
respect
to
his
superiors
he
is
guilty
when
he
deceives
himself
and
he
should
be
punished
if
he
infringed
either
the
duties
or
laws
of
his
office
baisemeaux
looked
at
the
bishop
with
astonishment
it
follows
pursued
aramis
that
you
are
going
to
ask
advice
to
put
your
conscience
at
ease
in
the
matter
yes
monseigneur
and
if
a
superior
officer
gives
you
orders
you
will
obey
never
doubt
it
monseigneur
you
know
the
kings
signature
well
m
de
baisemeaux
yes
monseigneur
is
it
not
on
this
order
of
release
it
is
true
but
it
may
be
forged
you
mean
that
is
evident
monseigneur
you
are
right
and
that
of
m
de
lyonne
i
see
it
plain
enough
on
the
order
but
for
the
same
reason
that
the
kings
signature
may
have
been
forged
so
also
and
with
even
greater
probability
may
m
de
lyonnes
your
logic
has
the
stride
of
a
giant
m
de
baisemeaux
said
aramis
and
your
reasoning
is
irresistible
but
on
what
special
grounds
do
you
base
your
idea
that
these
signatures
are
false
on
this
the
absence
of
countersignatures
nothing
checks
his
majestys
signature
and
m
de
lyonne
is
not
there
to
tell
me
he
has
signed
well
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
said
aramis
bending
an
eagle
glance
on
the
governor
i
adopt
so
frankly
your
doubts
and
your
mode
of
clearing
them
up
that
i
will
take
a
pen
if
you
will
give
me
one
baisemeaux
gave
him
a
pen
and
a
sheet
of
white
paper
added
aramis
baisemeaux
handed
him
some
paper
now
ii
alsoi
here
presentincontestably
iam
going
to
write
an
order
to
which
i
am
certain
you
will
give
credence
incredulous
as
you
are
baisemeaux
turned
pale
at
this
icy
assurance
of
manner
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
voice
of
the
bishops
but
just
now
so
playful
and
gay
had
become
funereal
and
sad
that
the
wax
lights
changed
into
the
tapers
of
a
mortuary
chapel
the
very
glasses
of
wine
into
chalices
of
blood
aramis
took
a
pen
and
wrote
baisemeaux
in
terror
read
over
his
shoulder
a
m
d
g
wrote
the
bishop
and
he
drew
a
cross
under
these
four
letters
which
signify
ad
majorem
dei
gloriam
to
the
greater
glory
of
god
and
thus
he
continued
it
is
our
pleasure
that
the
order
brought
to
m
de
baisemeaux
de
montlezun
governor
for
the
king
of
the
castle
of

and
effectual
and
be
immediately
carried
into
operation
signed
dherblay
general
of
the
order
by
the
grace
of
god
baisemeaux
was
so
profoundly
astonished
that
his
features
remained
contracted
his
lips
parted
and
his
eyes
fixed
he
did
not
move
an
inch
nor
articulate
a
sound
nothing
could
be
heard
in
that
large
chamber
but
the
wingwhisper
of
a
little
moth
which
was
fluttering
to
its
death
about
the
candles
aramis
without
even
deigning
to
look
at
the
man
whom
he
had
reduced
to
so
miserable
a
condition
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
case
of
black
wax
he
sealed
the
letter
and
stamped
it
with
a
seal
suspended
at
his
breast
beneath
his
doublet
and
when
the
operation
was
concluded
presentedstill
in
silencethe
missive
to
m
de
baisemeaux
the
latter
whose
hands
trembled
in
a
manner
to
excite
pity
turned
a
dull
and
meaningless
gaze
upon
the
letter
a
last
gleam
of
feeling
played
over
his
features
and
he
fell
as
if
thunderstruck
on
a
chair
come
come
said
aramis
after
a
long
silence
during
which
the
governor
of
the
bastile
had
slowly
recovered
his
senses
do
not
lead
me
to
believe
dear
baisemeaux
that
the
presence
of
the
general
of
the
order
is
as
terrible
as
his
and
that
men
die
merely
from
having
seen
him
take
courage
rouse
yourself
give
me
your
handobey
baisemeaux
reassured
if
not
satisfied
obeyed
kissed
aramiss
hand
and
rose
immediately
he
murmured
oh
there
is
no
pressing
haste
my
host
take
your
place
again
and
do
the
honors
over
this
beautiful
dessert
monseigneur
i
shall
never
recover
such
a
shock
as
this
i
who
have
laughed
who
have
jested
with
you
i
who
have
dared
to
treat
you
on
a
footing
of
equality
say
nothing
about
it
old
comrade
replied
the
bishop
who
perceived
how
strained
the
cord
was
and
how
dangerous
it
would
have
been
to
break
it
say
nothing
about
it
let
us
each
live
in
our
own
way
to
you
my
protection
and
my
friendship
to
me
your
obedience
having
exactly
fulfilled
these
two
requirements
let
us
live
happily
baisemeaux
reflected
he
perceived
at
a
glance
the
consequence
of
this
withdrawal
of
a
prisoner
by
means
of
a
forged
order
and
putting
in
the
scale
the
guarantee
offered
him
by
the
official
order
of
the
general
did
not
consider
it
of
any
value
aramis
divined
this
my
dear
baisemeaux
said
he
you
are
a
simpleton
lose
this
habit
of
reflection
when
i
give
myself
the
trouble
to
think
for
you
and
at
another
gesture
he
made
baisemeaux
bowed
again
how
shall
i
set
about
it
he
said
what
is
the
process
for
releasing
a
prisoner
i
have
the
regulations
well
then
follow
the
regulations
my
friend
i
go
with
my
major
to
the
prisoners
room
and
conduct
him
if
he
is
a
personage
of
importance
but
this
marchiali
is
not
an
important
personage
said
aramis
carelessly
i
dont
know
answered
the
governor
as
if
he
would
have
said
it
is
for
you
to
instruct
me
then
if
you
dont
know
it
i
am
right
so
act
towards
marchiali
as
you
act
towards
one
of
obscure
station
good
the
regulations
so
provide
they
are
to
the
effect
that
the
turnkey
or
one
of
the
lower
officials
shall
bring
the
prisoner
before
the
governor
in
the
office
well
tis
very
wise
that
and
then
then
we
return
to
the
prisoner
the
valuables
he
wore
at
the
time
of
his
imprisonment
his
clothes
and
papers
if
the
ministers
orders
have
not
otherwise
dictated
what
was
the
ministers
order
as
to
this
marchiali
nothing
for
the
unhappy
man
arrived
here
without
jewels
without
papers
and
almost
without
clothes
see
how
simple
then
all
is
indeed
baisemeaux
you
make
a
mountain
of
everything
remain
here
and
make
them
bring
the
prisoner
to
the
governors
house
baisemeaux
obeyed
he
summoned
his
lieutenant
and
gave
him
an
order
which
the
latter
passed
on
without
disturbing
himself
about
it
to
the
next
whom
it
concerned
half
an
hour
afterwards
they
heard
a
gate
shut
in
the
court
it
was
the
door
to
the
dungeon
which
had
just
rendered
up
its
prey
to
the
free
air
aramis
blew
out
all
the
candles
which
lighted
the
room
but
one
which
he
left
burning
behind
the
door
this
flickering
glare
prevented
the
sight
from
resting
steadily
on
any
object
it
multiplied
tenfold
the
changing
forms
and
shadows
of
the
place
by
its
wavering
uncertainty
steps
drew
near
go
and
meet
your
men
said
aramis
to
baisemeaux
the
governor
obeyed
the
sergeant
and
turnkeys
disappeared
baisemeaux
reentered
followed
by
a
prisoner
aramis
had
placed
himself
in
the
shade
he
saw
without
being
seen
baisemeaux
in
an
agitated
tone
of
voice
made
the
young
man
acquainted
with
the
order
which
set
him
at
liberty
the
prisoner
listened
without
making
a
single
gesture
or
saying
a
word
you
will
swear
tis
the
regulation
that
requires
it
added
the
governor
never
to
reveal
anything
that
you
have
seen
or
heard
in
the
bastile
the
prisoner
perceived
a
crucifix
he
stretched
out
his
hands
and
swore
with
his
lips
and
now
monsieur
you
are
free
whither
do
you
intend
going
the
prisoner
turned
his
head
as
if
looking
behind
him
for
some
protection
on
which
he
ought
to
rely
then
was
it
that
aramis
came
out
of
the
shade
i
am
here
he
said
to
render
the
gentleman
whatever
service
he
may
please
to
ask
the
prisoner
slightly
reddened
and
without
hesitation
passed
his
arm
through
that
of
aramis
god
have
you
in
his
holy
keeping
he
said
in
a
voice
the
firmness
of
which
made
the
governor
tremble
as
much
as
the
form
of
the
blessing
astonished
him
aramis
on
shaking
hands
with
baisemeaux
said
to
him
does
my
order
trouble
you
do
you
fear
their
finding
it
here
should
they
come
to
search
i
desire
to
keep
it
monseigneur
said
baisemeaux
if
they
found
it
here
it
would
be
a
certain
indication
i
should
be
lost
and
in
that
case
you
would
be
a
powerful
and
a
last
auxiliary
for
me
being
your
accomplice
you
mean
answered
aramis
shrugging
his
shoulders
adieu
baisemeaux
said
he
the
horses
were
in
waiting
making
each
rusty
spring
reverberate
the
carriage
again
with
their
impatience
baisemeaux
accompanied
the
bishop
to
the
bottom
of
the
steps
aramis
caused
his
companion
to
mount
before
him
then
followed
and
without
giving
the
driver
any
further
order
go
on
said
he
the
carriage
rattled
over
the
pavement
of
the
courtyard
an
officer
with
a
torch
went
before
the
horses
and
gave
orders
at
every
post
to
let
them
pass
during
the
time
taken
in
opening
all
the
barriers
aramis
barely
breathed
and
you
might
have
heard
his
sealed
heart
knock
against
his
ribs
the
prisoner
buried
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
made
no
more
sign
of
life
than
his
companion
at
length
a
jolt
more
sever
than
the
others
announced
to
them
that
they
had
cleared
the
last
watercourse
behind
the
carriage
closed
the
last
gate

in

no

the
horses
kept
in
check
by
a
vigorous
hand
went
quietly
as
far
as
the
middle
of
the
faubourg
there
they
began
to
trot
little
by
little
whether
they
were
warming
to
their
work
or
whether
they
were
urged
they
gained
in
swiftness
and
once
past
bercy
the
carriage
seemed
to
fly
so
great
was
the
ardor
of
the
coursers
the
horses
galloped
thus
as
far
as
villeneuve
st
georges
where
relays
were
waiting
then
four
instead
of
two
whirled
the
carriage
away
in
the
direction
of
melun
and
pulled
up
for
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
of
senart
no
doubt
the
order
had
been
given
the
postilion
beforehand
for
aramis
had
no
occasion
even
to
make
a
sign
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
prisoner
as
if
waking
from
a
long
dream
the
matter
is
monseigneur
said
aramis
that
before
going
further
it
is
necessary
your
royal
highness
and
i
should
converse
i
will
await
an
opportunity
monsieur
answered
the
young
prince
we
could
not
have
a
better
monseigneur
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
forest
and
no
one
can
hear
us
the
postilion
the
postilion
of
this
relay
is
deaf
and
dumb
monseigneur
i
am
at
your
service
m
dherblay
is
it
your
pleasure
to
remain
in
the
carriage
yes
we
are
comfortably
seated
and
i
like
this
carriage
for
it
has
restored
me
to
liberty
wait
monseigneur
there
is
yet
a
precaution
to
be
taken
what
we
are
here
on
the
highway
cavaliers
or
carriages
traveling
like
ourselves
might
pass
and
seeing
us
stopping
deem
us
in
some
difficulty
let
us
avoid
offers
of
assistance
which
would
embarrass
us
give
the
postilion
orders
to
conceal
the
carriage
in
one
of
the
side
avenues
tis
exactly
what
i
wished
to
do
monseigneur
aramis
made
a
sign
to
the
deaf
and
dumb
driver
of
the
carriage
whom
he
touched
on
the
arm
the
latter
dismounted
took
the
leaders
by
the
bridle
and
led
them
over
the
velvet
sward
and
the
mossy
grass
of
a
winding
alley
at
the
bottom
of
which
on
this
moonless
night
the
deep
shades
formed
a
curtain
blacker
than
ink
this
done
the
man
lay
down
on
a
slope
near
his
horses
who
on
either
side
kept
nibbling
the
young
oak
shoots
i
am
listening
said
the
young
prince
to
aramis
but
what
are
you
doing
there
i
am
disarming
myself
of
my
pistols
of
which
we
have
no
further
need

the
tempter
my
prince
said
aramis
turning
in
the
carriage
towards
his
companion
weak
creature
as
i
am
so
unpretending
in
genius
so
low
in
the
scale
of
intelligent
beings
it
has
never
yet
happened
to
me
to
converse
with
a
man
without
penetrating
his
thoughts
through
that
living
mask
which
has
been
thrown
over
our
mind
in
order
to
retain
its
expression
but
tonight
in
this
darkness
in
the
reserve
which
you
maintain
i
can
read
nothing
on
your
features
and
something
tells
me
that
i
shall
have
great
difficulty
in
wresting
from
you
a
sincere
declaration
i
beseech
you
then
not
for
love
of
me
for
subjects
should
never
weigh
as
anything
in
the
balance
which
princes
hold
but
for
love
of
yourself
to
retain
every
syllable
every
inflexion
which
under
the
present
most
grave
circumstances
will
all
have
a
sense
and
value
as
important
as
any
every
uttered
in
the
world
i
listen
replied
the
young
prince
decidedly
without
either
eagerly
seeking
or
fearing
anything
you
are
about
to
say
to
me
and
he
buried
himself
still
deeper
in
the
thick
cushions
of
the
carriage
trying
to
deprive
his
companion
not
only
of
the
sight
of
him
but
even
of
the
very
idea
of
his
presence
black
was
the
darkness
which
fell
wide
and
dense
from
the
summits
of
the
intertwining
trees
the
carriage
covered
in
by
this
prodigious
roof
would
not
have
received
a
particle
of
light
not
even
if
a
ray
could
have
struggled
through
the
wreaths
of
mist
that
were
already
rising
in
the
avenue
monseigneur
resumed
aramis
you
know
the
history
of
the
government
which
today
controls
france
the
king
issued
from
an
infancy
imprisoned
like
yours
obscure
as
yours
and
confined
as
yours
only
instead
of
ending
like
yourself
this
slavery
in
a
prison
this
obscurity
in
solitude
these
straightened
circumstances
in
concealment
he
was
fain
to
bear
all
these
miseries
humiliations
and
distresses
in
full
daylight
under
the
pitiless
sun
of
royalty
on
an
elevation
flooded
with
light
where
every
stain
appears
a
blemish
every
glory
a
stain
the
king
has
suffered
it
rankles
in
his
mind
and
he
will
avenge
himself
he
will
be
a
bad
king
i
say
not
that
he
will
pour
out
his
peoples
blood
like
louis
xi
or
charles
ix
for
he
has
no
mortal
injuries
to
avenge
but
he
will
devour
the
means
and
substance
of
his
people
for
he
has
himself
undergone
wrongs
in
his
own
interest
and
money
in
the
first
place
then
i
acquit
my
conscience
when
i
consider
openly
the
merits
and
the
faults
of
this
great
prince
and
if
i
condemn
him
my
conscience
absolves
me
aramis
paused
it
was
not
to
listen
if
the
silence
of
the
forest
remained
undisturbed
but
it
was
to
gather
up
his
thoughts
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
soulto
leave
the
thoughts
he
had
uttered
sufficient
time
to
eat
deeply
into
the
mind
of
his
companion
all
that
heaven
does
heaven
does
well
continued
the
bishop
of
vannes
and
i
am
so
persuaded
of
it
that
i
have
long
been
thankful
to
have
been
chosen
depositary
of
the
secret
which
i
have
aided

monseigneur
why
you
are
raising
your
head
and
are
surprised
at
the
people
i
have
under
my
command
you
did
not

you
were
dealing
with
a
kingoh
monseigneur
king
of
a
people
very
humble
much
disinherited
humble
because
they
have
no
force
save
when
creeping
disinherited

never
almost
never

my
people

the
harvest
they
sow
nor
eat

fruit
they
cultivate
they
labor
for
an
abstract
idea
they
heap
together
all
the
atoms
of
their
power
so
from
a
single
man
and
round
this
man
with
the
sweat
of
their
labor
they
create
a
misty
halo
which
his
genius
shall
in
turn
render
a
glory
gilded
with
the
rays
of
all
the
crowns
in
christendom
such
is
the
man
you
have
beside
you
monseigneur
it
is
to
tell
you
that
he
has
drawn
you
from
the
abyss
for
a
great
purpose
to
raise

the

monseigneur
replied
the
bishop
i
should
not
take
the
trouble
to
play
this
terrible
game
with
your
royal
highness

in
gaining
it
the

will
overturn

it
rolling
so
far
that
not
even

it
will
ever
again
recall
to
you
its
right

i
aspire

i
am
convinced
that
when
arrived
at
the
summit
you
will
judge
me
still
more
worthy

your

then
monseigneur
we

will

how

if
you
act
in
such
a
manner
that
no

there
are
grave
difficulties
state
them
prince
my
brother
is
married
i
cannot
take
my
brothers
wife
i
will
cause
spain
to
consent
to
a
divorce
it
is
in
the
interest
of
your
new
policy
it
is
human
morality
all
that
is
really
noble
and
really
useful
in
this
world
will
find
its
account
therein
the
imprisoned
king
will
speak
to
whom
do
you
think
he
will
speakto
the
walls
you
mean
by
walls
the
men
in
whom
you
put
confidence
if
need
be
yes
and
besides
your
royal
highness
besides
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
designs
of
providence
do
not
stop
on
such
a
fair
road
every
scheme
of
this
caliber
is
completed
by
its
results
like
a
geometrical
calculation
the
king
in
prison
will
not
be
for
you
the
cause
of
embarrassment
that
you
have
been
for
the
king
enthroned
his
soul
is
naturally
proud
and
impatient
it
is
moreover
disarmed
and
enfeebled
by
being
accustomed
to
honors
and
by
the
license
of
supreme
power
the
same
providence
which
has
willed
that
the
concluding
step
in
the
geometrical
calculation
i
have
had
the
honor
of
describing
to
your
royal
highness
should
be
your
ascension
to
the
throne
and
the
destruction
of
him
who
is
hurtful
to
you
has
also
determined
that
the
conquered
one
shall
soon
end
both
his
own
and
your
sufferings
therefore
his
soul
and
body
have
been
adapted
for
but
a
brief
agony
put
into
prison
as
a
private
individual
left
alone
with
your
doubts
deprived
of
everything
you
have
exhibited
the
most
sublime
enduring
principle
of
life
in
withstanding
all
this
but
your

to

at

in

gloomy
analysis
a
bird
of
night
uttered
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
that
prolonged
and
plaintive
cry
which
makes
every
creature
tremble
i
will
exile
the
deposed
king
said
philippe
shuddering
twill
be
more
human
the
kings
good
pleasure
will
decide
the
point
said
aramis
but
has
the
problem
been
well
put
have
i
brought
out
of
the
solution
according
to
the
wishes
or
the
foresight
of
your
royal
highness
yes
monsieur
yes
you
have
forgotten
nothingexcept
indeed
two
things
the
first
let
us
speak
of
it
at
once
with
the
same
frankness
we
have
already
conversed
in
let
us
speak
of
the
causes
which
may
bring
about
the
ruin
of
all
the
hopes
we
have
conceived
let
us
speak
of
the
risks
we
are
running
they
would
be
immense
infinite
terrific
insurmountable
if
as
i
have
said
all
things
did
not
concur
to
render
them
of
absolutely
no
account
there
is
no
danger
either
for
you
or
for
me
if
the
constancy
and
intrepidity
of
your
royal
highness
are
equal
to
that
perfection
of
resemblance
to
your
brother
which
nature
has
bestowed
upon
you
i
repeat
it
there
are
no
dangers
only
obstacles
a
word
indeed
which
i
find
in
all
languages
but
have
always
illunderstood
and
were
i
king
would
have
obliterated
as
useless
and
absurd
yes
indeed
monsieur
there
is
a
very
serious
obstacle
an
insurmountable
danger
which
you
are
forgetting
ah
said
aramis
there
is
conscience
which
cries
aloud
remorse
that
never
dies
true
true
said
the
bishop
there
is
a
weakness
of
heart
of
which
you
remind
me
you
are
right
too
for
that
indeed
is
an
immense
obstacle
the
horse
afraid
of
the
ditch
leaps
into
the
middle
of
it
and
is
killed
the
man
who
trembling
crosses
his
sword
with
that
of
another
leaves
loopholes
whereby
his
enemy
has
him
in
his
power
have
you
a
brother
said
the
young
man
to
aramis
i
am
alone
in
the
world
said
the
latter
with
a
hard
dry
voice
but
surely
there
is
some
one
in
the
world
whom
you
love
added
philippe
no
oneyes
i
love
you
the
young
man
sank
into
so
profound
a
silence
that
the
mere
sound
of
his
respiration
seemed
like
a
roaring
tumult
for
aramis
monseigneur
he
resumed
i
have
not
said
all
i
had
to
say
to
your
royal
highness
i
have
not
offered
you
all
the
salutary
counsels
and
useful
resources
which
i
have
at
my
disposal
it
is
useless
to
flash
bright
visions
before
the
eyes
of
one
who
seeks
and
loves
darkness
useless
too
is
it
to
let
the
magnificence
of
the
cannons
roar
make
itself
heard
in
the
ears
of
one
who
loves
repose
and
the
quiet
of
the
country
monseigneur
i
have
your
happiness
spread
out
before
me
in
my
thoughts
listen
to
my
words
precious
they
indeed
are
in
their
import
and
their
sense
for
you
who
look
with
such
tender
regard
upon
the
bright
heavens
the
verdant
meadows
the
pure
air
i

country
instinct
with
delights
of
every
kind
an
unknown
paradise
a
secluded
corner
of
the
worldwhere
alone
unfettered
and
unknown
in
the
thick
covert
of
the
woods
amidst
flowers
and
streams
of
rippling
water
you
will
forget
all
the
misery

human
folly
has
so
recently
allotted

will
not
take
you
unready
for
your
task

cast
you
into
the
crucible
of

sick
at

overcome
by
excess
of
the
emotions
which
but
one
hours
liberty
has
produced
in
you
for
me
that
is
a
certain
and
unmistakable
sign
that
you
do
not

you

life
a

my

more
than
sufficient
to

the

without

the

i
have

and
i
shall
at

have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
have
rendered
to
my
prince
the
major
service
he
himself
preferred
i

made
one
human

the
former
task
is

more
difficult
and
now
monseigneur
your
answer
to
this
proposition
here
is
the
money
nay
do
not
hesitate
at
poitou
you
can
risk
nothing
except
the
chance
of
catching
the
fevers
prevalent
there
and
even
of
them
the
socalled
wizards
of
the
country
will
cure
you
for
the
sake
of
your
pistoles
if
you
play
the
other
game
you
run
the
chance
of
being
assassinated
on
a
throne
strangled
in
a
prisoncell
upon
my
soul
i
assure
you
now
i
begin
to
compare
them
together
i
myself
should
hesitate
which
lot
i
should
accept
monsieur
replied
the
young
prince
before
i
determine
let
me
alight
from
this
carriage
walk
on
the
ground
and
consult
that
still
voice
within
me
which
heaven
bids
us
all
to
hearken
to
ten
minutes
is
all
i
ask
and
then
you
shall
have
your
answer
as
you
please
monseigneur
said
aramis
bending
before
him
with
respect
so
solemn
and
august
in
tone
and
address
had
sounded
these
strange
words
chapter
x
crown
and
tiara
aramis
was
the
first
to
descend
from
the
carriage
he
held
the
door
open
for
the
young
man
he
saw
him
place
his
foot
on
the
mossy
ground
with
a
trembling
of
the
whole
body
and
walk
round
the
carriage
with
an
unsteady
and
almost
tottering
step
it
seemed
as
if
the
poor
prisoner
was
unaccustomed
to
walk
on
gods
earth
it
was
the
15th
of
august
about
eleven
oclock
at
night
thick
clouds
portending
a
tempest
overspread
the
heavens
and
shrouded
every
light
and
prospect
underneath
their
heavy
folds
the
extremities
of
the
avenues
were
imperceptibly
detached
from
the
copse
by
a
lighter
shadow
of
opaque
gray
which
upon
closer
examination
became
visible
in
the
midst
of
the
obscurity
but
the
fragrance
which
ascended
from
the
grass
fresher
and
more
penetrating
than
that
which
exhaled
from
the
trees
around
him
the
warm
and
balmy
air
which
enveloped
him
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
past
the
ineffable
enjoyment
of
liberty
in
an
open
country
spoke
to
the
prince
in
so
seductive
a
language
that
notwithstanding
the
preternatural
caution
we
would
almost
say
dissimulation
of
his
character
of
which
we
have
tried
to
give
an
idea
he
could
not
restrain
his
emotion
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
ecstasy
then
by
degrees
he
raised
his
aching
head
and
inhaled
the
softly
scented
air
as
it
was
wafted
in
gentle
gusts
to
his
uplifted
face
crossing
his
arms
on
his
chest
as
if
to
control
this
new
sensation
of
delight
he
drank
in
delicious
draughts
of
that
mysterious
air
which
interpenetrates
at
night
the
loftiest
forests
the
sky
he
was
contemplating
the
murmuring
waters
the
universal
freshnesswas
not
all
this
reality
was
not
aramis
a
madman
to
suppose
that
he
had
aught
else
to
dream
of
in
this
world
those
exciting
pictures
of
country
life
so
free
from
fears
and
troubles
the
ocean
of
happy
days
that
glitters
incessantly
before
all
young
imaginations
are
real
allurements
wherewith
to
fascinate
a
poor
unhappy
prisoner
worn
out
by
prison
cares
emaciated
by
the
stifling
air
of
the
bastile
it
was
the
picture
it
will
be
remembered
drawn
by
aramis
when
he
offered
the
thousand
pistoles
he
had
with
him
in
the
carriage
to
the
prince
and
the
enchanted
eden
which
the
deserts
of
baspoitou
hid
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
such
were
the
reflections
of
aramis
as
he
watched
with
an
anxiety
impossible
to
describe
the
silent
progress
of
the
emotions
of
philippe
whom
he
perceived
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
absorbed
in
his
meditations
the
young
prince
was
offering
up
an
inward
prayer
to
heaven
to
be
divinely
guided
in
this
trying
moment
upon
which
his
life
or
death
depended
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
the
bishop
of
vannes
who
had
never
before
been
so
perplexed
his
iron
will
accustomed
to
overcome
all
obstacles
never
finding
itself
inferior
or
vanquished
on
any
occasion
to
be
foiled
in
so
vast
a
project
from
not
having
foreseen
the
influence
which
a
view
of
nature
in
all
its
luxuriance
would
have
on
the
human
mind
aramis
overwhelmed
by
anxiety
contemplated
with
emotion
the
painful
struggle
that
was
taking
place
in
philippes
mind
this
suspense
lasted
the
whole
ten
minutes
which
the
young
man
had
requested
during
this
space
of
time
which
appeared
an
eternity
philippe
continued
gazing
with
an
imploring
and
sorrowful
look
towards
the
heavens
aramis
did
not
remove
the
piercing
glance
he
had
fixed
on
philippe
suddenly
the
young
man
bowed
his
head
his
thought
returned
to
the
earth
his
looks
perceptibly
hardened
his
brow
contracted
his
mouth
assuming
an
expression
of
undaunted
courage
again
his
looks
became
fixed
but
this
time
they
wore
a
worldly
expression
hardened
by
covetousness
pride
and
strong
desire
aramiss
look
immediately
became
as
soft
as
it
had
before
been
gloomy
philippe
seizing
his
hand
in
a
quick
agitated
manner
exclaimed
lead
me
to
where
the
crown
of
france
is
to
be
found
is
this
your
decision
monseigneur
asked
aramis
it
is
irrevocably
so
philippe
did
not
even
deign
to
reply
he
gazed
earnestly
at
the
bishop
as
if
to
ask
him
if
it
were
possible
for
a
man
to
waver
after
having
once
made
up
his
mind
such
looks
are
flashes
of
the
hidden
fire
that
betrays
mens
character
said
aramis
bowing
over
philippes
hand
you
will
be
great
monseigneur
i
will
answer
for
that
let
us
resume
our
conversation
i
wished
to
discuss
two
points
with
you
in
the
first
place
the
dangers
or
the
obstacles
we
may
meet
with
that
point
is
decided
the
other
is
the
conditions
you
intend
imposing
on
me
it
is
your
turn
to
speak
m
dherblay
the
conditions
monseigneur
doubtless
you
will
not
allow
so
mere
a
trifle
to
stop
me
and
you
will
not
do
me
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
i
think
you
have
no
interest
in
this
affair
therefore
without
subterfuge
or
hesitation
tell
me
the
truth
i
will
do
so
monseigneur
once
a
king
when
will
that
be
tomorrow
eveningi
mean
in
the
night
explain
yourself
when
i
shall
have
asked
your
highness
a
question
do
so
i
sent
to
your
highness
a
man
in
my
confidence
with
instructions
to
deliver
some
closely
written
notes
carefully
drawn
up
which
will
thoroughly
acquaint
your
highness
with
the
different
persons
who
compose
and
will
compose
your
court
i
perused
those
notes
attentively
i
know
them
by
heart
and
understand
them
pardon
me
but
i
may
venture
to
ask
that
question
of
a
poor
abandoned
captive
of
the
bastile
in
a
weeks
time
it
will
not
be
requisite
to
further
question
a
mind
like
yours
you
will
then
be
in
full
possession
of
liberty
and
power
interrogate
me
then
and
i
will
be
a
scholar
representing
his
lesson
to
his
master
we
will
begin
with
your
family
monseigneur
my
mother
anne
of
austria
all
her
sorrows
her
painful
malady
oh
i
know
heri
know
her
your
second
brother
asked
aramis
bowing
to
these
notes
replied
the
prince
you
have
added
portraits
so
faithfully
painted
that
i
am
able
to
recognize
the
persons
whose
characters
manners
and
history
you
have
so
carefully
portrayed
monsieur
my
brother
is
a
fine
dark
young
man
with
a
pale
face
he
does
not
love
his
wife
henrietta
whom
i
louis
xiv
loved
a
little
and
still
flirt
with
even
although
she
made
me
weep
on
the
day
she
wished
to
dismiss
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
from
her
service
in
disgrace
you
will
have
to
be
careful
with
regard
to
the
watchfulness
of
the
latter
said
aramis
she
is
sincerely
attached
to
the
actual
king
the
eyes
of
a
woman
who
loves
are
not
easily
deceived
she
is
fair
has
blue
eyes
whose
affectionate
gaze
reveals
her
identity
she
halts
slightly
in
her
gait
she
writes
a
letter
every
day
to
which
i
have
to
send
an
answer
by
m
de
saintaignan
do
you
know
the
latter
as
if
i
saw
him
and
i
know
the
last
verses
he
composed
for
me
as
well
as
those
i
composed
in
answer
to
his
very
good
do
you
know
your
ministers
colbert
an
ugly
darkbrowed
man
but
intelligent
enough
his
hair
covering
his
forehead
a
large
heavy
full
head
the
mortal
enemy
of
m
fouquet
as
for
the
latter
we
need
not
disturb
ourselves
about
him
no
because
necessarily
you
will
not
require
me
to
exile
him
i
suppose
aramis
struck
with
admiration
at
the
remark
said
you
will
become
very
great
monseigneur
you
see
added
the
prince
that
i
know
my
lesson
by
heart
and
with
heavens
assistance
and
yours
afterwards
i
shall
seldom
go
wrong
you
have
still
an
awkward
pair
of
eyes
to
deal
with
monseigneur
yes
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
m
dartagnan
your
friend
yes
i
can
well
say
my
friend
he
who
escorted
la
valliere
to
le
chaillot
he
who
delivered
up
monk
cooped
in
an
iron
box
to
charles
ii
he
who
so
faithfully
served
my
mother
he
to
whom
the
crown
of
france
owes
so
much
that
it
owes
everything
do
you
intend
to
ask
me
to
exile
him
also
never
sire
dartagnan
is
a
man
to
whom
at
a
certain
given
time
i
will
undertake
to
reveal
everything
but
be
on
your
guard
with
him
for
if
he
discovers
our
plot
before
it
is
revealed
to
him
you
or
i
will
certainly
be
killed
or
taken
he
is
a
bold
and
enterprising
man
i
will
think
it
over
now
tell
me
about
m
fouquet
what
do
you
wish
to
be
done
with
regard
to
him
one
moment
more
i
entreat
you
monseigneur
and
forgive
me
if
i
seem
to
fail
in
respect
to
questioning
you
further
it
is
your
duty
to
do
so
nay
more
than
that
your
right
before
we
pass
to
m
fouquet
i
should
very
much
regret
forgetting
another
friend
of
mine
m
du
vallon
the
hercules
of
france
you
mean
oh
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
his
interests
are
more
than
safe
no
it
is
not
he
whom
i
intended
to
refer
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
then
and
his
son
the
son
of
all
four
of
us
that
poor
boy
who
is
dying
of
love
for
la
valliere
whom
my
brother
so
disloyally
bereft
him
of
be
easy
on
that
score
i
shall
know
how
to
rehabilitate
his
happiness
tell
me
only
one
thing
monsieur
dherblay
do
men
when
they
love
forget
the
treachery
that
has
been
shown
them
can
a
man
ever
forgive
the
woman
who
has
betrayed
him
is
that
a
french
custom
or
is
it
one
of
the
laws
of
the
human
heart
a
man
who
loves
deeply
as
deeply
as
raoul
loves
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
finishes
by
forgetting
the
fault
or
crime
of
the
woman
he
loves
but
i
do
not
yet
know
whether
raoul
will
be
able
to
forget
i
will
see
after
that
have
you
anything
further
to
say
about
your
friend
no
that
is
all
well
then
now
for
m
fouquet
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
for
him
to
keep
him
on
as
surintendant
in
the
capacity
in
which
he
has
hitherto
acted
i
entreat
you
be
it
so
but
he
is
the
first
minister
at
present
not
quite
so
a
king
ignorant
and
embarrassed
as
i
shall
be
will
as
a
matter
of
course
require
a
first
minister
of
state
your
majesty
will
require
a
friend
i
have
only
one
and
that
is
yourself
you
will
have
many
others
by
and
by
but
none
so
devoted
none
so
zealous
for
your
glory
you
shall
be
my
first
minister
of
state
not
immediately
monseigneur
for
that
would
give
rise
to
too
much
suspicion
and
astonishment
m
de
richelieu
the
first
minister
of
my
grandmother
marie
de
medici
was
simply
bishop
of
lucon
as
you
are
bishop
of
vannes
i
perceive
that
your
royal
highness
has
studied
my
notes
to
great
advantage
your
amazing
perspicacity
overpowers
me
with
delight
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
m
de
richelieu
by
means
of
the
queens
protection
soon
became
cardinal
it
would
be
better
said
aramis
bowing
that
i
should
not
be
appointed
first
minister
until
your
royal
highness
has
procured
my
nomination
as
cardinal
you
shall
be
nominated
before
two
months
are
past
monsieur
dherblay
but
that
is
a
matter
of
very
trifling
moment
you
would
not
offend
me
if
you
were
to
ask
more
than
that
and
you
would
cause
me
serious
regret
if
you
were
to
limit
yourself
to
that
in
that
case
i
have
something
still
further
to
hope
for
monseigneur
speak
speak
m
fouquet
will
not
keep
long
at
the
head
of
affairs
he
will
soon
get
old
he
is
fond
of
pleasure
consistently
i
mean
with
all
his
labors
thanks
to
the
youthfulness
he
still
retains
but
this
protracted
youth
will
disappear
at
the
approach
of
the
first
serious
annoyance
or
at
the
first
illness
he
may
experience
we
will
spare
him
the
annoyance
because
he
is
an
agreeable
and
noblehearted
man
but
we
cannot
save
him
from
illhealth
so
it
is
determined
when
you
shall
have
paid
all
m
fouquets
debts
and
restored
the
finances
to
a
sound
condition
m
fouquet
will
be
able
to
remain
the
sovereign
ruler
in
his
little
court
of
poets
and
painterswe
shall
have
made
him
rich
when
that
has
been
done
and
i
have
become
your
royal
highnesss
prime
minister
i
shall
be
able
to
think
of
my
own
interests
and
yours
the
young
man
looked
at
his
interrogator
m
de
richelieu
of
whom
we
were
speaking
just
now
was
very
much
to
blame
in
the
fixed
idea
he
had
of
governing
france
alone
unaided
he
allowed
two
kings
king
louis
xiii
and
himself
to
be
seated
on
the
selfsame
throne
whilst
he
might
have
installed
them
more
conveniently
upon
two
separate
and
distinct
thrones
upon
two
thrones
said
the
young
man
thoughtfully
in
fact
pursued
aramis
quietly
a
cardinal
prime
minister
of
france
assisted
by
the
favor
and
by
the
countenance
of
his
most
christian
majesty
the
king
of
france
a
cardinal
to
whom
the
king
his
master
lends
the
treasures
of
the
state
his
army
his
counsel
such
a
man
would
be
acting
with
twofold
injustice
in
applying
these
mighty
resources
to
france
alone
besides
added
aramis
you
will
not
be
a
king
such
as
your
father
was
delicate
in
health
slow
in
judgment
whom
all
things
wearied
you
will
be
a
king
governing
by
your
brain
and
by
your
sword
you
will
have
in
the
government
of
the
state
no
more
than
you
will
be
able
to
manage
unaided
i
should
only
interfere
with
you
besides
our
friendship
ought
never
to
be
i
do
not
say
impaired
but
in
any
degree
affected
by
a
secret
thought
i
shall
have
given
you
the
throne
of
france
you
will
confer
on
me
the
throne
of
st
peter
whenever
your
loyal
firm
and
mailed
hand
should
joined
in
ties
of
intimate
association
the
hand
of
a
pope
such
as
i
shall
be
neither
charles
v
who
owned
twothirds
of
the
habitable
globe
nor
charlemagne
who
possessed
it
entirely
will
be
able
to
reach
to
half
your
stature
i
have
no
alliances
i
have
no
predilections
i
will
not
throw
you
into
persecutions
of
heretics
nor
will
i
cast
you
into
the
troubled
waters
of
family
dissension
i
will
simply
say
to
you
the
whole
universe
is
our
own
for
me
the
minds
of
men
for
you
their
bodies
and
as
i
shall
be
the
first
to
die
you
will
have
my
inheritance
what
do
you
say
of
my
plan
monseigneur
i
say
that
you
render
me
happy
and
proud
for
no
other
reason
than
that
of
having
comprehended
you
thoroughly
monsieur
dherblay
you
shall
be
cardinal
and
when
cardinal
my
prime
minister
and
then
you
will
point
out
to
me
the
necessary
steps
to
be
taken
to
secure
your
election
as
pope
and
i
will
take
them
you
can
ask
what
guarantees
from
me
you
please
it
is
useless
never
shall
i
act
except
in
such
a
manner
that
you
will
be
the
gainer
i
shall
never
ascend
the
ladder
of
fortune
fame
or
position
until
i
have
first
seen
you
placed
upon
the
round
of
the
ladder
immediately
above
me
i
shall
always
hold
myself
sufficiently
aloof
from
you
to
escape
incurring
your
jealousy
sufficiently
near
to
sustain
your
personal
advantage
and
to
watch
over
your
friendship
all
the
contracts
in
the
world
are
easily
violated
because
the
interests
included
in
them
incline
more
to
one
side
than
to
another
with
us
however
this
will
never
be

my

was
speedily
removed

the
chateau
de
vauxlevicomte
the
chateau
of
vauxlevicomte
situated
about
a
league
from
melun
had
been
built
by
fouquet
in
1655
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
scarcity
of
money
in
france
mazarin
had
taken
all
that
there
was
and
fouquet
expended
the
remainder
however
as
certain
men
have
fertile
false
and
useful
vices
fouquet
in
scattering
broadcast
millions
of
money
in
the
construction
of
this
palace
had
found
a
means
of
gathering
as
the
result
of
his
generous
profusion
three
illustrious
men
together
levau
the
architect
of
the
building
lenotre
the
designer
of
the
gardens
and
lebrun
the
decorator
of
the
apartments
if
the
chateau
de
vaux
possessed
a
single
fault
with
which
it
could
be
reproached
it
was
its
grand
pretentious
character
it
is
even
at
the
present
day
proverbial
to
calculate
the
number
of
acres
of
roofing
the
restoration
of
which
would
in
our
age
be
the
ruin
of
fortunes
cramped
and
narrowed
as

nothing
could
be
more
noble
in
appearance
than
the
central
forecourt
raised
upon
the
flight
of
steps
like
a
king
upon
his
throne
having
around
it
four
pavilions
at
the
angles
the
immense
ionic
columns
of
which
rose
majestically
to
the
whole
height
of
the
building
the
friezes
ornamented
with
arabesques
and
the
pediments
which
crowned
the
pilasters
conferred
richness
and
grace
on
every
part
of
the
building
while
the
domes
which
surmounted
the
whole
added
proportion
and
majesty
this
mansion
built
by
a
subject
bore
a
far
greater
resemblance
to
those
royal
residences
which
wolsey
fancied
he
was
called
upon
to
construct
in
order
to
present
them
to
his
master
from
the
fear
of
rendering
him
jealous
but
if
magnificence
and
splendor
were
displayed
in
any
one
particular
part
of
this
palace
more
than
anotherif
anything
could
be
preferred
to
the
wonderful
arrangement
of
the
interior

the
sumptuousness
of
the
gilding
and
to
the
profusion
of

were

as
wonderful
in

even
at
the

for

watered
m

had
divided

were
hurrying
to

in

in

while

who
had

arrived
walked
all
through
the
palace
with
a
calm
observant
glance

last
orders

raised
the
temperature
of

ripened
on
the

those
magnificent
peaches

the

fifty
years
later
spoke
so
regretfully
when

little

that
a

would
nibble

without
a

was
sufficient
to
recall
to
the
memory
of
this
great
monarch
the
mournful
shade
of
the
last
surintendant
of
france
with
a
perfect
reliance
that
aramis
had
made
arrangements
fairly
to
distribute
the
vast
number
of
guests
throughout
the
palace
and
that
he
had
not
omitted
to
attend
to
any
of
the
internal
regulations
for
their
comfort

the
preparations
which
had
been
made
for

another

led
him
over
the
theater
at
last
after
he
had
visited
the
chapel
the
salons
and
the
galleries
and
was
again
going
downstairs
exhausted
with
fatigue
fouquet
saw
aramis
on
the
staircase
the
prelate
beckoned
to
him
the
surintendant
joined
his
friend
and
with
him
paused
before
a
large
picture
scarcely
finished
applying
himself
heart
and
soul
to
his
work
the
painter
lebrun
covered
with
perspiration
stained
with
paint
pale
from
fatigue
and
the
inspiration
of
genius
was
putting
the
last
finishing
touches
with
his
rapid
brush
it
was
the
portrait
of
the
king
whom
they
were
expecting
dressed
in
the
court
suit
which
percerin
had
condescended
to
show
beforehand
to
the
bishop
of
vannes
fouquet
placed
himself
before
this
portrait
which
seemed
to
live
as
one
might
say
in
the
cool
freshness
of
its
flesh
and
in
its
warmth
of
color
he
gazed
upon
it
long
and
fixedly
estimated
the
prodigious
labor
that
had
been
bestowed
upon
it
and
not
being
able
to
find
any
recompense
sufficiently
great
for
this
herculean
effort
he
passed
his
arm
round
the
painters
neck
and
embraced
him
the
surintendant
by
this
action
had
utterly
ruined
a
suit
of
clothes
worth
a
thousand
pistoles
but
he
had
satisfied
more
than
satisfied
lebrun
it
was
a
happy
moment
for
the
artist
it
was
an
unhappy
moment
for
m
percerin
who
was
walking
behind
fouquet
and
was
engaged
in
admiring
in
lebruns
painting
the
suit
that
he
had
made
for
his
majesty
a
perfect
objet
dart
as
he
called
it
which
was
not
to
be
matched
except
in
the
wardrobe
of
the
surintendant
his
distress
and
his
exclamations
were
interrupted
by
a
signal
which
had
been
given
from
the
summit
of
the
mansion
in
the
direction
of
melun
in
the
still
empty
open
plain
the
sentinels
of
vaux
had
just
perceived
the
advancing
procession
of
the
king
and
the
queens
his
majesty
was
entering
melun
with
his
long
train
of
carriages
and
cavaliers
in
an
hour
said
aramis
to
fouquet
in
an
hour
replied
the
latter
sighing
and
the
people
who
ask
one
another
what
is
the
good
of
these
royal
fetes
continued
the
bishop
of
vannes
laughing
with
his
false
smile
alas
i
too
who
am
not
the
people
ask
myself
the
same
thing
i
will
answer
you
in
four
and
twenty
hours
monseigneur
assume
a
cheerful
countenance
for
it
should
be
a
day
of
true
rejoicing
well
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
dherblay
said
the
surintendant
with
a
swelling
heart
pointing
at
the
cortege
of
louis
visible
in
the
horizon
he
certainly
loves
me
but
very
little
and
i
do
not
care
much
more
for
him
but
i
cannot
tell
you
how
it
is
that
since
he
is
approaching
my
house
well
what
well
since
i
know
he
is
on
his
way
here
as
my
guest
he
is
more
sacred
than
ever
for
me
he
is
my
acknowledged
sovereign
and
as
such
is
very
dear
to
me
dear
yes
said
aramis
playing
upon
the
word
as
the
abbe
terray
did
at
a
later
period
with
louis
xv
do
not
laugh
dherblay
i
feel
that
if
he
really
seemed
to
wish
it
i
could
love
that
young
man
you
should
not
say
that
to
me
returned
aramis
but
rather
to
m
colbert
to
m
colbert
exclaimed
fouquet
why
so
because
he
would
allow
you
a
pension
out
of
the
kings
privy
purse
as
soon
as
he
becomes
surintendant
said
aramis
preparing
to
leave
as
soon
as
he
had
dealt
this
last
blow
where
are
you
going
returned
fouquet
with
a
gloomy
look
to
my
own
apartment
in
order
to
change
my
costume
monseigneur
whereabouts
are
you
lodging
dherblay
in
the
blue
room
on
the
second
story
the
room
immediately
over
the
kings
room
precisely
you
will
be
subject
to
very
great
restraint
there
what
an
idea
to
condemn
yourself
to
a
room
where
you

xii
the
wine
of
melun
the
king
had
in
point
of
fact
entered
melun
with
the
intention
of
merely
passing
through
the
city
the
youthful
monarch
was
most
eagerly
anxious
for
amusements
only
twice
during
the
journey
had
he
been
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
la
valliere
and
suspecting
that
his
only
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
would
be
after
nightfall
in
the
gardens
and
after
the
ceremonial
of
reception
had
been
gone
through
he
had
been
very
desirous
to
arrive
at
vaux
as
early
as
possible
but
he
reckoned
without
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
and
without
m
colbert
like
calypso
who
could
not
be
consoled
at
the
departure
of
ulysses
our
gascon
could
not
console
himself
for
not
having
guessed
why
aramis
had
asked
percerin
to
show
him
the
kings
new
costumes
there
is
not
a
doubt
he
said
to
himself
that
my
friend
the
bishop
of
vannes
had
some
motive
in
that
and
then
he
began
to
rack
his
brains
most
uselessly
dartagnan
so
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
court
intrigues
who
knew
the
position
of
fouquet
better
than
even
fouquet
himself
did
had
conceived
the
strangest
fancies
and
suspicions
at
the
announcement
of
the
fete
which
would
have
ruined
a
wealthy
man
and
which
became
impossible
utter
madness
even
for
a
man
so
poor
as
he
was
and
then
the
presence
of
aramis
who
had
returned
from
belleisle
and
been
nominated
by
monsieur
fouquet
inspectorgeneral
of
all
the
arrangements
his
perseverance
in
mixing
himself
up
with
all
the
surintendants
affairs
his
visits
to
baisemeaux
all
this
suspicious
singularity
of
conduct
had
excessively
troubled
and
tormented
dartagnan
during
the
last
two
weeks
with
men
of
aramiss
stamp
he
said
one
is
never
the
stronger
except
sword
in
hand
so
long
as
aramis
continued
a
soldier
there
was
hope
of
getting
the
better
of
him
but
since
he
has
covered
his
cuirass
with
a
stole
we
are
lost
but
what
can
aramiss
object
possibly
be
and
dartagnan
plunged
again
into
deep
thought
what
does
it
matter
to
me
after
all
he
continued
if
his
only
object
is
to
overthrow
m
colbert
and
what
else
can
he
be
after
and
dartagnan
rubbed
his
foreheadthat
fertile
land
whence
the
plowshare
of
his
nails
had
turned
up
so
many
and
such
admirable
ideas
in
his
time
he
at
first
thought
of
talking
the
matter
over
with
colbert
but
his
friendship
for
aramis
the
oath
of
earlier
days
bound
him
too
strictly
he
revolted
at
the
bare
idea
of
such
a
thing
and
besides
he
hated
the
financier
too
cordially
then
again
he
wished
to
unburden
his
mind
to
the
king
but
yet
the
king
would
not
be
able
to
understand
the
suspicions
which
had
not
even
a
shadow
of
reality
at
their
base
he
resolved
to
address
himself
to
aramis
direct
the
first
time
he
met
him
i
will
get
him
said
the
musketeer
between
a
couple
of
candles
suddenly
and
when
he
least
expects
it
i
will
place
my
hand
upon
his
heart
and
he
will
tell
mewhat
will
he
tell
me
yes
he
will
tell
me
something
for
mordioux
there
is
something
in
it
i
know
somewhat
calmer
dartagnan
made
every
preparation
for
the
journey
and
took
the
greatest
care
that
the
military
household
of
the
king
as
yet
very
inconsiderable
in
numbers
should
be
well
officered
and
well
disciplined
in
its
meager
and
limited
proportions
the
result
was
that
through
the
captains
arrangements
the
king
on
arriving
at
melun
saw
himself
at
the
head
of
both
the
musketeers
and
swiss
guards
as
well
as
a
picket
of
the
french
guards
it
might
almost
have
been
called
a
small
army
m
colbert
looked
at
the
troops
with
great
delight
he
even
wished
they
had
been
a
third
more
in
number
but
why
said
the
king
in
order
to
show
greater
honor
to
m
fouquet
replied
colbert
in
order
to
ruin
him
the
sooner
thought
dartagnan
when
this
little
army
appeared
before
melun
the
chief
magistrates
came
out
to
meet
the
king
and
to
present
him
with
the
keys
of
the
city
and
invited
him
to
enter
the
hotel
de
ville
in
order
to
partake
of
the
wine
of
honor
the
king
who
expected
to
pass
through
the
city
and
to
proceed
to
vaux
without
delay
became
quite
red
in
the
face
from
vexation
who
was
fool
enough
to
occasion
this
delay
muttered
the
king
between
his
teeth
as
the
chief
magistrate
was
in
the
middle
of
a
long
address
not
i
certainly
replied
dartagnan
but
i
believe
it
was
m
colbert
colbert
having
heard
his
name
pronounced
said
what
was
m
dartagnan
good
enough
to
say
i
was
good
enough
to
remark
that
it
was
you
who
stopped
the
kings
progress
so
that
he
might
taste
the
vin
de
brie
was
i
right
quite
so
monsieur
in
that
case
then
it
was
you
whom
the
king
called
some
name
or
other
what
name
i
hardly
know
but
wait
a
momentidiot
i
think
it
wasno
no
it
was
fool
or
dolt
yes
his
majesty
said
that
the
man
who
had
thought
of
the
vin
de
melun
was
something
of
the
sort
dartagnan
after
this
broadside
quietly
caressed
his
mustache
m
colberts
large
head
seemed
to
become
larger
and
larger
than
ever
dartagnan
seeing
how
ugly
anger
made
him
did
not
stop
halfway
the
orator
still
went
on
with
his
speech
while
the
kings
color
was
visibly
increasing
mordioux
said
the
musketeer
coolly
the
king
is
going
to
have
an
attack
of
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
where
the
deuce
did
you
get
hold
of
that
idea
monsieur
colbert
you
have
no
luck
monsieur
said
the
financier
drawing
himself
up
my
zeal
for
the
kings
service
inspired
me
with
the
idea
bah
monsieur
melun
is
a
city
an
excellent
city
which
pays
well
and
which
it
would
be
imprudent
to
displease
there
now
i
who
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
financier
saw
only
one
idea
in
your
idea
what
was
that
monsieur
that
of
causing
a
little
annoyance
to
m
fouquet
who
is
making
himself
quite
giddy
on
his
donjons
yonder
in
waiting
for
us
this
was
a
homestroke
hard
enough
in
all
conscience
colbert
was
completely
thrown
out
of
the
saddle
by
it
and
retired
thoroughly
discomfited
fortunately
the
speech
was
now
at
an
end
the
king
drank
the
wine
which
was
presented
to
him
and
then
every
one
resumed
the
progress
through
the
city
the
king
bit
his
lips
in
anger
for
the
evening
was
closing
in
and
all
hope
of
a
walk
with
la
valliere
was
at
an
end
in
order
that
the
whole
of
the
kings
household
should
enter
vaux
four
hours
at
least
were
necessary
owing
to
the
different
arrangements
the
king
therefore
who
was
boiling
with
impatience
hurried
forward
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
reach
it
before
nightfall
but
at
the
moment
he
was
setting
off
again
other
and
fresh
difficulties
arose
is
not
the
king
going
to
sleep
at
melun
said
colbert
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
to
dartagnan
m
colbert
must
have
been
badly
inspired
that
day
to
address
himself
in
that
manner
to
the
chief
of
the
musketeers
for
the
latter
guessed
that
the
kings
intention
was
very
far
from
that
of
remaining
where
he
was
dartagnan
would
not
allow
him
to
enter
vaux
except
he
were
well
and
strongly
accompanied
and
desired
that
his
majesty
would
not
enter
except
with
all
the
escort
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
that
these
delays
would
irritate
that
impatient
monarch
beyond
measure
in
what
way
could
he
possibly
reconcile
these
difficulties
dartagnan
took
up
colberts
remark
and
determined
to
repeated
it
to
the
king
sire
he
said
m
colbert
has
been
asking
me
if
your
majesty
does
not
intend
to
sleep
at
melun
sleep
at
melun
what
for
exclaimed
louis
xiv
sleep
at
melun
who
in
heavens
name
can
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
when
m
fouquet
is
expecting
us
this
evening
it
was
simply
replied
colbert
quickly
the
fear
of
causing
your
majesty
the
least
delay
for
according
to
established
etiquette
you
cannot
enter
any
place
with
the
exception
of
your
own
royal
residences
until
the
soldiers
quarters
have
been
marked
out
by
the
quartermaster
and
the
garrison
properly
distributed
dartagnan
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
biting
his
mustache
to
conceal
his
vexation
and
the
queens
were
not
less
interested
they
were
fatigued
and
would
have
preferred
to
go
to
rest
without
proceeding
any
farther
more
especially
in
order
to
prevent
the
king
walking
about
in
the
evening
with
m
de
saintaignan
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
for
if
etiquette
required
the
princesses
to
remain
within
their
own
rooms
the
ladies
of
honor
as
soon
as
they
had
performed
the
services
required
of
them
had
no
restrictions
placed
upon
them
but
were
at
liberty
to
walk
about
as
they
pleased
it
will
easily
be
conjectured
that
all
these
rival
interests
gathering
together
in
vapors
necessarily
produced
clouds
and
that
the
clouds
were
likely
to
be
followed
by
a
tempest
the
king
had
no
mustache
to
gnaw
and
therefore
kept
biting
the
handle
of
his
whip
instead
with
illconcealed
impatience
how
could
he
get
out
of
it
dartagnan
looked
as
agreeable
as
possible
and
colbert
as
sulky
as
he
could
who
was
there
he
could
get
in
a
passion
with
we
will
consult
the
queen
said
louis
xiv
bowing
to
the
royal
ladies
and
this
kindness
of
consideration
softened
maria
theresas
heart
who
being
of
a
kind
and
generous
disposition
when
left
to
her
own
freewill
replied
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
whatever
your
majesty
wishes
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
get
to
vaux
inquired
anne
of
austria
in
slow
and
measured
accents
placing
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
where
the
seat
of
her
pain
lay
an
hour
for
your
majestys
carriages
said
dartagnan
the
roads
are
tolerably
good
the
king
looked
at
him
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
the
king
he
hastened
to
add
we
should
arrive
by
daylight
said
louis
xiv
but
the
billeting
of
the
kings
military
escort
objected
colbert
softly
will
make
his
majesty
lose
all
the
advantage
of
his
speed
however
quick
he
may
be
double
ass
that
you
are
thought
dartagnan
if
i
had
any
interest
or
motive
in
demolishing
your
credit
with
the
king
i
could
do
it
in
ten
minutes
if
i
were
in
the
kings
place
he
added
aloud
i
should
in
going
to
m
fouquet
leave
my
escort
behind
me
i
should
go
to
him
as
a
friend
i
should
enter
accompanied
only
by
my
captain
of
the
guards
i
should
consider
that
i
was
acting
more
nobly
and
should
be
invested
with
a
still
more
sacred
character
by
doing
so
delight
sparkled
in
the
kings
eyes
that
is
indeed
a
very
sensible
suggestion
we
will
go
to
see
a
friend
as
friends
the
gentlemen
who
are
with
the
carriages
can
go
slowly
but
we
who
are
mounted
will
ride
on
and
he
rode
off
accompanied
by
all
those
who
were
mounted
colbert
hid
his
ugly
head
behind
his
horses
neck
i
shall
be
quits
said
dartagnan
as
he
galloped
along
by
getting
a
little
talk
with
aramis
this
evening
and
then
m
fouquet
is
a
man
of
honor
mordioux
i
have
said
so
and
it
must
be
so
and
this
was
the
way
how
towards
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
without
announcing
his
arrival
by
the
din
of
trumpets
and
without
even
his
advanced
guard
without
outriders
or
musketeers
the
king
presented
himself
before
the
gate
of
vaux
where
fouquet
who
had
been
informed
of
his
royal
guests
approach
had
been
waiting
for
the
last
halfhour
with
his
head
uncovered
surrounded
by
his
household
and
his
friends

m
fouquet
held
the
stirrup
of
the
king
who
having
dismounted
bowed
most
graciously
and
more
graciously
still
held
out
his
hand
to
him
which
fouquet
in
spite
of
a
slight
resistance
on
the
kings
part
carried
respectfully
to
his
lips
the
king
wished
to
wait
in
the
first
courtyard
for
the
arrival
of
the
carriages
nor
had
he
long
to
wait
for
the
roads
had
been
put
into
excellent
order
by
the
superintendent
and
a
stone
would
hardly
have
been
found
of
the
size
of
an
egg
the
whole
way
from
melun
to
vaux
so
that
the
carriages
rolling
along
as
though
on
a
carpet
brought
the
ladies
to
vaux
without
jolting
or
fatigue
by
eight
oclock
they
were
received
by
madame
fouquet
and
at
the
moment
they
made
their
appearance
a
light
as
bright
as
day
burst
forth
from
every
quarter
trees
vases
and
marble
statues
this
species
of
enchantment
lasted
until
their
majesties
had
retired
into
the
palace
all
these
wonders
and
magical
effects
which
the
chronicler
has
heaped
up
or
rather
embalmed
in
his
recital
at
the
risk
of
rivaling
the
brainborn
scenes
of
romancers
these
splendors
whereby
night
seemed
vanquished
and
nature
corrected
together
with
every
delight
and
luxury
combined
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
the
senses
as
well
as
the
imagination
fouquet
did
in
real
truth
offer
to
his
sovereign
in
that
enchanting
retreat
of
which
no
monarch
could
at
that
time
boast
of
possessing
an
equal
we
do
not
intend
to
describe
the
grand
banquet
at
which
the
royal
guests
were
present
nor
the
concerts
nor
the
fairylike
and
more
than
magic
transformations
and
metamorphoses
it
will
be
enough
for
our
purpose
to
depict
the
countenance
the
king
assumed
which
from
being
gay
soon
wore
a
very
gloomy
constrained
and
irritated
expression
he
remembered
his
own
residence
royal
though
it
was
and
the
mean
and
indifferent
style
of
luxury
that
prevailed
there
which
comprised
but
little
more
than
what
was
merely
useful
for
the
royal
wants
without
being
his
own
personal
property
the
large
vases
of
the
louvre
the
older
furniture
and
plate
of
henry
ii
of
francis
i
and
of
louis
xi
were
but
historic
monuments
of
earlier
days
nothing
but
specimens
of
art
the
relics
of
his
predecessors
while
with
fouquet
the
value
of
the
article
was
as
much
in
the
workmanship
as
in
the
article
itself
fouquet
ate
from
a
gold
service
which
artists
in
his
own
employ
had
modeled
and
cast
for
him
alone
fouquet
drank
wines
of
which
the
king
of
france
did
not
even
know
the
name
and
drank
them
out
of
goblets
each
more
valuable
than
the
entire
royal
cellar
what
too
was
to
be
said
of
the
apartments
the
hangings
the
pictures
the
servants
and
officers
of
every
description
of
his
household
what
of
the
mode
of
service
in
which
etiquette
was
replaced
by
order
stiff
formality
by
personal
unrestrained
comfort
the
happiness
and
contentment
of
the
guest
became
the
supreme
law
of
all
who
obeyed
the
host
the
perfect
swarm
of
busily
engaged
persons
moving
about
noiselessly
the
multitude
of
guestswho
were
however
even
less
numerous
than
the
servants
who
waited
on
themthe
myriad
of
exquisitely
prepared
dishes
of
gold
and
silver
vases
the
floods
of
dazzling
light
the
masses
of
unknown
flowers
of
which
the
hothouses
had
been
despoiled
redundant
with
luxuriance
of
unequaled
scent
and
beauty
the
perfect
harmony
of
the
surroundings
which
indeed
was
no
more
than
the
prelude
of
the
promised
fete
charmed
all
who
were
there
and
they
testified
their
admiration
over
and
over
again
not
by
voice
or
gesture
but
by
deep
silence
and
rapt
attention
those
two
languages
of
the
courtier
which
acknowledge
the
hand
of
no
master
powerful
enough
to
restrain
them
as
for
the
king
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
dared
not
look
at
the
queen
anne
of
austria
whose
pride
was
superior
to
that
of
any
creature
breathing
overwhelmed
her
host
by
the
contempt
with
which
she
treated
everything
handed
to
her
the
young
queen
kindhearted
by
nature
and
curious
by
disposition
praised
fouquet
ate
with
an
exceedingly
good
appetite
and
asked
the
names
of
the
strange
fruits
as
they
were
placed
upon
the
table
fouquet
replied
that
he
was
not
aware
of
their
names
the
fruits
came
from
his
own
stores
he
had
often
cultivated
them
himself
having
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
cultivation
of
exotic
fruits
and
plants
the
king
felt
and
appreciated
the
delicacy
of
the
replies
but
was
only
the
more
humiliated
he
thought
the
queen
a
little
too
familiar
in
her
manners
and
that
anne
of
austria
resembled
juno
a
little
too
much
in
being
too
proud
and
haughty
his
chief
anxiety
however
was
himself
that
he
might
remain
cold
and
distant
in
his
behavior
bordering
lightly
the
limits
of
supreme
disdain
or
simple
admiration
but
fouquet
had
foreseen
all
this
he
was
in
fact
one
of
those
men
who
foresee
everything
the
king
had
expressly
declared
that
so
long
as
he
remained
under
fouquets
roof
he
did
not
wish
his
own
different
repasts
to
be
served
in
accordance
with
the
usual
etiquette
and
that
he
would
consequently
dine
with
the
rest
of
society
but
by
the
thoughtful
attention
of
the
surintendant
the
kings
dinner
was
served
up
separately
if
one
may
so
express
it
in
the
middle
of
the
general
table
the
dinner
wonderful
in
every
respect
from
the
dishes
of
which
was
composed
comprised
everything
the
king
liked
and
generally
preferred
to
anything
else

indeed
who
had
the
keenest
appetite
in
his
kingdomfor
saying
that
he
was
not
hungry
nay
m

did
even
better
still
he
certainly
in
obedience
to
the
kings
expressed
desire
seated
himself
at
the
table
but
as
soon
as
the
soups
were
served
he
arose
and
personally
waited
on
the
king
while
madame
fouquet
stood
behind
the
queenmothers
armchair
the
disdain
of
juno
and
the
sulky
fits
of
temper
of
jupiter
could
not
resist
this
excess
of
kindly
feeling
and
polite
attention
the
queen
ate
a
biscuit
dipped
in
a
glass
of
sanlucar
wine
and
the
king
ate
of
everything
saying
to
m
fouquet
it
is
impossible
monsieur
le
surintendant
to
dine
better
anywhere
whereupon
the
whole
court
began
on
all
sides
to
devour
the
dishes
spread
before
them
with
such
enthusiasm
that
it
looked
as
though
a
cloud
of
egyptian
locusts
was
settling
down
on
green
and
growing
crops
as
soon
however
as
his
hunger
was
appeased
the
king
became
morose
and
overgloomed
again
the
more
so
in
proportion
to
the
satisfaction
he
fancied
he
had
previously
manifested
and
particularly
on
account
of
the
deferential
manner
which
his
courtiers
had
shown
towards
fouquet
dartagnan
who
ate
a
good
deal
and
drank
but
little
without
allowing
it
to
be
noticed
did
not
lose
a
single
opportunity
but
made
a
great
number
of
observations
which
he
turned
to
good
profit
when
the
supper
was
finished
the
king
expressed
a
wish
not
to
lose
the
promenade
the
park
was
illuminated
the
moon
too
as
if
she
had
placed
herself
at
the
orders
of
the

of

silvered
the
trees
and

with
her
own
bright
and
quasiphosphorescent
light
the
air
was
strangely
soft
and
balmy
the
daintily
shellgravelled
walks
through
the
thickly
set
avenues
yielded
luxuriously
to
the
feet
the
fete
was
complete
in
every
respect
for
the
king
having
met
la
valliere
in
one
of
the
winding
paths
of
the
wood
was
able
to
press
her
hand
and
say
i
love
you
without
any
one
overhearing
him
except
m
dartagnan
who
followed
and
m
fouquet
who
preceded
him
the
dreamy
night
of
magical
enchantments
stole
smoothly
on
the
king
having
requested
to
be
shown
to
his
room
there
was
immediately
a
movement
in
every
direction
the
queens
passed
to
their
own
apartments
accompanied
by
them
music
of
theorbos
and
lutes
the

found
his
musketeers
awaiting
him
on
the
grand
flight
of
steps

on
from

he
was
weary
he
had
supped
well
and
wished
for
once
in
his
life
thoroughly
to
enjoy
a
fete
given
by
a
man
who
was
in

sense
of
the
word
a
king
m

he
said

man
for

the
king
was
conducted
with
the
greatest
ceremony
to
the
chamber
of
morpheus
of
which
we
owe
some
cursory
description
to
our
readers
it
was
the
handsomest
and
largest
in
the
palace
lebrun
had
painted
on
the
vaulted
ceiling
the
happy
as
well
as
the
unhappy
dreams
which
morpheus
inflicts
on
kings
as
well
as
on
other
men
everything
that
sleep
gives
birth
to
that
is
lovely
its
fairy
scenes
its
flowers
and
nectar
the
wild
voluptuousness
or
profound
repose
of
the
senses
had
the
painter
elaborated
on
his
frescoes
it
was
a
composition
as
soft
and
pleasing
in
one
part
as
dark
and
gloomy
and
terrible
in
another
the
poisoned
chalice
the
glittering
dagger
suspended
over
the
head
of
the
sleeper
wizards
and
phantoms
with
terrific
masks
those
halfdim
shadows
more
alarming
than
the
approach
of
fire
or
the
somber
face
of
midnight
these
and
such
as
these
he
had
made
the
companions
of
his
more
pleasing
pictures
no
sooner
had
the
king
entered
his
room
than
a
cold
shiver
seemed
to
pass
through
him
and
on
fouquet
asking
him
the
cause
of
it
the
king
replied
as
pale
as
death
i
am
sleepy
that
is
all
does
your
majesty
wish
for
your
attendants
at
once
no
i
have
to
talk
with
a
few
persons

said

you
have
the
goodness
to
tell

chapter

a
gascon
and
a
gascon
and
a
half
dartagnan
had
determined
to
lose
no
time
and
in
fact
he
never
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
after
having
inquired
for
aramis
he
had
looked
for
him
in
every
direction
until
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
him
besides
no
sooner
had
the
king
entered
vaux
than
aramis
had
retired
to
his
own
room
meditating
doubtless
some
new
piece
of
gallant
attention
for
his
majestys
amusement
dartagnan
desired
the
servants
to
announce
him
and
found
on
the
second
story
in
a
beautiful
room
called
the
blue
chamber
on
account
of
the
color
of
its
hangings
the
bishop
of
vannes
in
company
with
porthos
and
several
of
the
modern
epicureans
aramis
came
forward
to
embrace
his
friend
and
offered
him
the
best
seat
as
it
was
after
awhile
generally
remarked
among
those
present
that
the
musketeer
was
reserved
and
wished
for
an
opportunity
for
conversing
secretly
with
aramis
the
epicureans
took
their
leave
porthos
however
did
not
stir
for
true
it
is
that
having
dined
exceedingly
well
he
was
fast
asleep
in
his
armchair
and
the
freedom
of
conversation
therefore
was
not
interrupted
by
a
third
person
porthos
had
a
deep
harmonious
snore
and
people
might
talk
in
the
midst
of
its
loud
bass
without
fear
of
disturbing
him
dartagnan
felt
that
he
was
called
upon
to
open
the
conversation
well
and
so
we
have
come
to
vaux
he
said
why
yes
dartagnan
and
how
do
you
like
the
place
very
much
and
i
like
m
fouquet
also
is
he
not
a
charming
host
no
one
could
be
more
so
i
am
told
that
the
king
began
by
showing
great
distance
of
manner
towards
m
fouquet
but
that
his
majesty
grew
much
more
cordial
afterwards
you
did
not
notice
it
then
since
you
say
you
have
been
told
so
no
i
was
engaged
with
the
gentlemen
who
have
just
left
the
room
about
the
theatrical
performances
and
the
tournaments
which
are
to
take
place
tomorrow
ah
indeed
you
are
the
comptrollergeneral
of
the
fetes
here
then
you
know
i
am
a
friend
of
all
kinds
of
amusement
where
the
exercise
of
the
imagination
is
called
into
activity
i
have
always
been
a
poet
in
one
way
or
another
yes
i
remember
the
verses
you
used
to
write
they
were
charming
i
have
forgotten
them
but
i
am
delighted
to
read
the
verses
of
others
when
those
others
are
known
by
the
names
of
moliere
pelisson
la
fontaine
etc
do
you
know
what
idea
occurred
to
me
this
evening
aramis
no
tell
me
what
it
was
for
i
should
never
be
able
to
guess
it
you
have
so
many
well
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
the
true
king
of
france
is
not
louis
xiv
what
said
aramis
involuntarily
looking
the
musketeer
full
in
the
eyes
no
it
is
monsieur
fouquet
aramis
breathed
again
and
smiled
ah
you
are
like
all
the
rest
jealous
he
said
i
would
wager
that
it
was
m
colbert
who
turned
that
pretty
phrase
dartagnan
in
order
to
throw
aramis
off
his
guard
related
colberts
misadventures
with
regard
to
the
vin
de
melun
he
comes
of
a
mean
race
does
colbert
said
aramis
quite
true
when
i
think
too
added
the
bishop
that
that
fellow
will
be
your
minister
within
four
months
and
that
you
will
serve
him
as
blindly
as
you
did
richelieu
or
mazarin
and
as
you
serve
m
fouquet
said
dartagnan
with
this
difference
though
that
m
fouquet
is
not
m
colbert
true
true
said
dartagnan
as
he
pretended
to
become
sad
and
full
of
reflection
and
then
a
moment
after
he
added
why
do
you
tell
me
that
m
colbert
will
be
minister
in
four
months
because
m
fouquet
will
have
ceased
to
be
so
replied
aramis
he
will
be
ruined
you
mean
said
dartagnan
completely
so
why
does
he
give
these
fetes
then
said
the
musketeer
in
a
tone
so
full
of
thoughtful
consideration
and
so
well
assumed
that
the
bishop
was
for
the
moment
deceived
by
it
why
did
you
not
dissuade
him
from
it
the
latter
part
of
the
phrase
was
just
a
little
too
much
and
aramiss
former
suspicions
were
again
aroused
it
is
done
with
the
object
of
humoring
the
king
by
ruining
himself
yes
by
ruining
himself
for
the
king
a
most
eccentric
one
might
say
sinister
calculation
that
necessity
necessity
my
friend
i
dont
see
that
dear
aramis
do
you
not
have
you
not
remarked
m
colberts
daily
increasing
antagonism
and
that
he
is
doing
his
utmost
to
drive
the
king
to
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
one
must
be
blind
not
to
see
it
and
that
a
cabal
is
already
armed
against
m
fouquet
that
is
well
known
what
likelihood
is
there
that
the
king
would
join
a
party
formed
against
a
man
who
will
have
spent
everything
he
had
to
please
him
true
true
said
dartagnan
slowly
hardly
convinced
yet
curious
to
broach
another
phase
of
the
conversation
there
are
follies
and
follies
he
resumed
and
i
do
not
like
those
you
are
committing
what
do
you
allude
to
as
for
the
banquet
the
ball
the
concert
the
theatricals
the
tournaments
the
cascades
the
fireworks
the
illuminations
and
the
presentsthese
are
well
and
good
i
grant
but
why
were
not
these
expenses
sufficient
why
was
it
necessary
to
have
new
liveries
and
costumes
for
your
whole
household
you
are
quite
right
i
told
m
fouquet
that
myself
he
replied
that
if
he
were
rich
enough
he
would
offer
the
king
a
newly
erected
chateau
from
the
vanes
at
the
houses
to
the
very
subcellars
completely
new
inside
and
out
and
that
as
soon
as
the
king
had
left
he
would
burn
the
whole
building
and
its
contents
in
order
that
it
might
not
be
made
use
of
by
any
one
else
how
completely
spanish
i
told
him
so
and
he
then
added
this
whoever
advises
me
to
spare
expense
i
shall
look
upon
as
my
enemy
it
is
positive
madness
and
that
portrait
too
what
portrait
said
aramis
that
of
the
king
and
the
surprise
as
well
what
surprise
the
surprise
you
seem
to
have
in
view
and
on
account
of
which
you
took
some
specimens
away
when
i
met
you
at
percerins
dartagnan
paused
the
shaft
was
discharged
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
wait
and
watch
its
effect
that
is
merely
an
act
of
graceful
attention
replied
aramis
dartagnan
went
up
to
his
friend
took
hold
of
both
his
hands
and
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
said
aramis
do
you
still
care
for
me
a
very
little
what
a
question
to
ask
very
good
one
favor
then
why
did
you
take
some
patterns
of
the
kings
costumes
at
percerins
come
with
me
and
ask
poor
lebrun
who
has
been
working
upon
them
for
the
last
two
days
and
nights
aramis
that
may
be
truth
for
everybody
else
but
for
me
upon
my
word
dartagnan
you
astonish
me
be
a
little
considerate
tell
me
the
exact
truth
you
would
not
like
anything
disagreeable
to
happen
to
me
would
you
my
dear
friend
you
are
becoming
quite
incomprehensible
what
suspicion
can
you
have
possibly
got
hold
of
do
you
believe
in
my
instinctive
feelings
formerly
you
used
to
have
faith
in
them
well
then
an
instinct
tells
me
that
you
have
some
concealed
project
on
foot
ia
project
i
am
convinced
of
it
what
nonsense
i
am
not
only
sure
of
it
but
i
would
even
swear
it
indeed
dartagnan
you
cause
me
the
greatest
pain
is
it
likely
if
i
have
any
project
in
hand
that
i
ought
to
keep
secret
from
you
i
should
tell
you
about
it
if
i
had
one
that
i
could
and
ought
to
have
revealed
should
i
not
have
long
ago
divulged
it
no
aramis
no
there
are
certain
projects
which
are
never
revealed
until
the
favorable
opportunity
arrives
in
that
case
my
dear
fellow
returned
the
bishop
laughing
the
only
thing
now
is
that
the
opportunity
has
not
yet
arrived
dartagnan
shook
his
head
with
a
sorrowful
expression
oh
friendship
friendship
he
said
what
an
idle
word
you
are
here
is
a
man
who
if
i
were
but
to
ask
it
would
suffer
himself
to
be
cut
in
pieces
for
my
sake
you
are
right
said
aramis
nobly
and
this
man
who
would
shed
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
for
me
will
not
open
up
before
me
the
least
corner
in
his
heart
friendship
i
repeat
is
nothing
but
an
unsubstantial
shadowa
lure
like
everything
else
in
this
bright
dazzling
world
it
is
not
thus
you
should
speak
of
our
friendship
replied
the
bishop
in
a
firm
assured
voice
for
ours
is
not
of
the
same
nature
as
those
of
which
you
have
been
speaking
look
at
us
aramis
three
out
of
the
old
four
you
are
deceiving
me
i
suspect
you
and
porthos
is
fast
asleep
an
admirable
trio
of
friends
dont
you
think
so
what
an
affecting
relic
of
the
former
dear
old
times
i
can
only
tell
you
one
thing
dartagnan
and
i
swear
it
on
the
bible
i
love
you
just
as
i
used
to
do
if
i
ever
suspect
you
it
is
on
account
of
others
and
not
on
account
of
either
of
us
in
everything
i
may
do
and
should
happen
to
succeed
in
you
will
find
your
fourth
will
you
promise
me
the
same
favor
if
i
am
not
mistaken
aramis
your
wordsat
the
moment
you
pronounce
themare
full
of
generous
feeling
such
a
thing
is
very
possible
you
are
conspiring
against
m
colbert
if
that
be
all
mordioux
tell
me
so
at
once
i
have
the
instrument
in
my
own
hand
and
will
pull
out
the
tooth
easily
enough
aramis
could
not
conceal
a
smile
of
disdain
that
flitted
over
his
haughty
features
and
supposing
that
i
were
conspiring
against
colbert
what
harm
would
there
be
in
that
no
no
that
would
be
too
trifling
a
matter
for
you
to
take
in
hand
and
it
was
not
on
that
account
you
asked
percerin
for
those
patterns
of
the
kings
costumes
oh
aramis
we
are
not
enemies
rememberwe
are
brothers
tell
me
what
you
wish
to
undertake
and
upon
the
word
of
a
dartagnan
if
i
cannot
help
you
i
will
swear
to
remain
neuter
i
am
undertaking
nothing
said
aramis
aramis
a
voice
within
me
speaks
and
seems
to
trickle
forth
a
rill
of
light
within
my
darkness
it
is
a
voice
that
has
never
yet
deceived
me
it
is
the
king
you
are
conspiring
against
the
king
exclaimed
the
bishop
pretending
to
be
annoyed
your
face
will
not
convince
me
the
king
i
repeat
will
you
help
me
said
aramis
smiling
ironically
aramis
i
will
do
more
than
help
youi
will
do
more
than
remain
neuteri
will
save
you
you
are
mad
dartagnan
i
am
the
wiser
of
the
two
in
this
matter
you
to
suspect
me
of
wishing
to
assassinate
the
king
who
spoke
of
such
a
thing
smiled
the
musketeer
well
let
us
understand
one
another
i
do
not
see
what
any
one
can
do
to
a
legitimate
king
as
ours
is
if
he
does
not
assassinate
him
dartagnan
did
not
say
a
word
besides
you
have
your
guards
and
your
musketeers
here
said
the
bishop
true
you
are
not
in
m
fouquets
house
but
in
your
own
true
but
in
spite
of
that
aramis
grant
me
for
pitys
sake
one
single
word
of
a
true
friend
a
true
friends
word
is
ever
truth
itself
if
i
think
of
touching
even
with
my
finger
the
son
of
anne
of
austria
the
true
king
of
this
realm
of
franceif
i
have
not
the
firm
intention
of
prostrating
myself
before
his
throneif
in
every
idea
i
may
entertain
tomorrow
here
at
vaux
will
not
be
the
most
glorious
day
my
king
ever
enjoyedmay
heavens
lightning
blast
me
where
i
stand
aramis
had
pronounced
these
words
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
alcove
of
his
own
bedroom
where
dartagnan
seated
with
his
back
towards
the
alcove
could
not
suspect
that
any
one
was
lying
concealed
the
earnestness
of
his
words
the
studied
slowness
with
which
he
pronounced
them
the
solemnity
of
his
oath
gave
the
musketeer
the
most
complete
satisfaction
he
took
hold
of
both
aramiss
hands
and
shook
them
cordially
aramis
had
endured
reproaches
without
turning
pale
and
had
blushed
as
he
listened
to
words
of
praise
dartagnan
deceived
did
him
honor
but
dartagnan
trustful
and
reliant
made
him
feel
ashamed
are
you
going
away
he
said
as
he
embraced
him
in
order
to
conceal
the
flush
on
his
face
yes
duty
summons
me
i
have
to
get
the
watchword
it
seems
i
am
to
be
lodged
in
the
kings
anteroom
where
does
porthos
sleep
take
him
away
with
you
if
you
like
for
he
rumbles
through
his
sleepy
nose
like
a
park
of
artillery
ah
he
does
not
stay
with
you
then
said
dartagnan
not
the
least
in
the
world
he
has
a
chamber
to
himself
but
i
dont
know
where
very
good
said
the
musketeer
from
whom
this
separation
of
the
two
associates
removed
his
last
suspicion
and
he
touched
porthos
lightly
on
the
shoulder
the
latter
replied
by
a
loud
yawn
come
said
dartagnan
what
dartagnan
my
dear
fellow
is
that
you
what
a
lucky
chance
oh
yestrue
i
have
forgotten
i
am
at
the
fete
at
vaux
yes
and
your
beautiful
dress
too
yes
it
was
very
attentive
on
the
part
of
monsieur
coquelin
de
voliere
was
it
not
hush
said
aramis
you
are
walking
so
heavily
you
will
make
the
flooring
give
way
true
said
the
musketeer
this
room
is
above
the
dome
i
think
and
i
did
not
choose
it
for
a
fencingroom
i

the
ceiling
of
the
kings
room
has
all
the
lightness
and
calm
of
wholesome
sleep
do
not
forget
therefore
that
my
flooring
is
merely
the
covering
of
his
ceiling
good
night
my
friends
and
in
ten
minutes
i
shall
be
asleep
myself
and
aramis
accompanied
them
to
the
door
laughing
quietly
all
the
while
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
he
bolted
the
door
hurriedly
closed
up
the
chinks
of
the
windows
and
then
called
out
monseigneurmonseigneur
philippe
made
his
appearance
from
the
alcove
as
he
pushed
aside
a
sliding
panel
placed
behind
the
bed
m
dartagnan
entertains
a
great
many
suspicions
it
seems
he
said
ahyou
recognized
m
dartagnan
then
before
you
called
him
by
his
name
even
he
is
your
captain
of
musketeers
he
is
very
devoted
to
me
replied
philippe
laying
a
stress
upon
the
personal
pronoun
as
faithful
as
a
dog
but
he
bites
sometimes
if
dartagnan
does
not
recognize
you
before
the
other
has
disappeared
rely
upon
dartagnan
to
the
end
of
the
world
for
in
that
case
if
he
has
seen
nothing
he
will
keep
his
fidelity
if
he
sees
when
it
is
too
late
he
is
a
gascon
and
will
never
admit
that
he
has
been
deceived
i
thought
so
what
are
we
to
do
now
sit
in
this
foldingchair
i
am
going
to
push
aside
a
portion
of
the
flooring
you
will
look
through
the
opening
which
answers
to
one
of
the
false
windows
made
in
the
dome
of
the
kings
apartment
can
you
see
yes
said
philippe
starting
as
at
the
sight
of
an
enemy
i
see
the
king
what
is
he
doing
he
seems
to
wish
some
man
to
sit
down
close
to
him
m
fouquet
no
no
wait
a
moment
look
at
the
notes
and
the
portraits
my
prince
the
man
whom
the
king
wishes
to
sit
down
in
his
presence
is
m
colbert
colbert
sit
down
in
the
kings
presence
exclaimed
aramis
it
is
impossible
look
aramis
looked
through
the
opening
in
the
flooring
yes
he
said
colbert
himself
oh
monseigneur
what
can
we
be
going
to
hearand
what
can
result
from
this
intimacy
nothing
good
for
m
fouquet
at
all
events
the
prince
did
not
deceive
himself
we
have
seen
that
louis
xiv
had
sent
for
colbert
and
colbert
had
arrived
the
conversation
began
between
them
by
the
king
according
to
him
one
of
the
highest
favors
that
he
had
ever
done
it
was
true
the
king
was
alone
with
his
subject
colbert
said
he
sit
down
the
intendant
overcome
with
delight
for
he
feared
he
was
about
to
be
dismissed
refused
this
unprecedented
honor
does
he
accept
said
aramis
no
he
remains
standing
let
us
listen
then
and
the
future
king
and
the
future
pope
listened
eagerly
to
the
simple
mortals
they
held
under
their
feet
ready
to
crush
them
when
they
liked
colbert
said
the
king
you
have
annoyed
me
exceedingly
today
i
know
it
sire
very
good
i
like
that
answer
yes
you
knew
it
and
there
was
courage
in
the
doing
of
it
i
ran
the
risk
of
displeasing
your
majesty
but
i
risked
also
the
concealment
of
your
best
interests
what
you
were
afraid
of
something
on
my
account
i
was
sire
even
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
an
indigestion
said
colbert
for
people
do
not
give
their
sovereigns
such
banquets
as
the
one
of
today
unless
it
be
to
stifle
them
beneath
the
burden
of
good
living
colbert
awaited
the
effect
this
coarse
jest
would
produce
upon
the
king
and
louis
xiv
who
was
the
vainest
and
the
most
fastidiously
delicate
man
in
his
kingdom
forgave
colbert
the
joke
the
truth
is
he
said
that
m
fouquet
has
given
me
too
good
a
meal
tell
me
colbert
where
does
he
get
all
the
money
required
for
this
enormous
expenditurecan
you
tell
yes
i
do
know
sire
will
you
be
able
to
prove
it
with
tolerable
certainty
easily
and
to
the
utmost
farthing
i
know
you
are
very
exact
exactitude
is
the
principal
qualification
required
in
an
intendant
of
finances
but
all
are
not
so
i
thank
you
majesty
for
so
flattering
a
compliment
from
your
own
lips
m
fouquet
therefore
is
richvery
rich
and
i
suppose
every
man
knows
he
is
so
every
one
sire
the
living
as
well
as
the
dead
what
does
that
mean
monsieur
colbert
the
living
are
witnesses
of
m
fouquets
wealththey
admire
and
applaud
the
result
produced
but
the
dead
wiser
and
better
informed
than
we
are
know
how
that
wealth
was
obtainedand
they
rise
up
in
accusation
so
that
m
fouquet
owes
his
wealth
to
some
cause
or
other
the
occupation
of
an
intendant
very
often
favors
those
who
practice
it
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
more
confidentially
i
perceive
do
not
be
afraid
we
are
quite
alone
i
am
never
afraid
of
anything
under
the
shelter
of
my
own
conscience
and
under
the
protection
of
your
majesty
said
colbert
bowing
if
the
dead
therefore
were
to
speak
they
do
speak
sometimes
sireread
ah
murmured
aramis
in
the
princes
ear
who
close
beside
him
listened
without
losing
a
syllable
since
you
are
placed
here
monseigneur
in
order
to
learn
your
vocation
of
a
king
listen
to
a
piece
of
infamyof
a
nature
truly
royal
you
are
about
to
be
a
witness
of
one
of
those
scenes
which
the
foul
fiend
alone
conceives
and
executes
listen
attentivelyyou
will
find
your
advantage
in
it
the
prince
redoubled
his
attention
and
saw
louis
xiv
take
from
colberts
hands
a
letter
the
latter
held
out
to
him
the
late
cardinals
handwriting
said
the
king
your
majesty
has
an
excellent
memory
replied
colbert
bowing
it
is
an
immense
advantage
for
a
king
who
is
destined
for
hard
work
to
recognize
handwritings
at
the
first
glance
the
king
read
mazarins
letter
and
as
its
contents
are
already
known
to
the
reader
in
consequence
of
the
misunderstanding
between
madame
de
chevreuse
and
aramis
nothing
further
would
be
learned
if
we
stated
them
here
again
i
do
not
quite
understand
said
the
king
greatly
interested
your
majesty
has
not
acquired
the
utilitarian
habit
of
checking
the
public
accounts
i
see
that
it
refers
to
money
that
had
been
given
to
m
fouquet
thirteen
millions
a
tolerably
good
sum
yes
well
these
thirteen
millions
are
wanting
to
balance
the
total
of
the
account
that
is
what
i
do
not
very
well
understand
how
was
this
deficit
possible
possible
i
do
not
say
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
fact
that
it
is
really
so
you
say
that
these
thirteen
millions
are
found
to
be
wanting
in
the
accounts
i
do
not
say
so
but
the
registry
does
and
this
letter
of
m
mazarin
indicates
the
employment
of
that
sum
and
the
name
of
the
person
with
whom
it
was
deposited
as
your
majesty
can
judge
for
yourself
yes
and
the
result
is
then
that
m
fouquet
has
not
yet
restored
the
thirteen
millions
that
results
from
the
accounts
certainly
sire
well
and
consequently
well
sire
in
that
case
inasmuch
as
m
fouquet
has
not
yet
given
back
the
thirteen
millions
he
must
have
appropriated
them
to
his
own
purpose
and
with
those
thirteen
millions
one
could
incur
four
times
and
a
little
more
as
much
expense
and
make
four
times
as
great
a
display
as
your
majesty
was
able
to
do
at
fontainebleau
where
we
only
spent
three
millions
altogether
if
you
remember
for
a
blunderer
the
souvenir
he
had
evoked
was
a
rather
skillfully
contrived
piece
of
baseness
for
by
the
remembrance
of
his
own
fete
he
for
the
first
time
perceived
its
inferiority
compared
with
that
of
fouquet
colbert
received
back
again
at
vaux
what
fouquet
had
given
him
at
fontainebleau
and
as
a
good
financier
returned
it
with
the
best
possible
interest
having
once
disposed
the
kings
mind
in
this
artful
way
colbert
had
nothing
of
much
importance
to
detain
him
he
felt
that
such
was
the
case
for
the
king
too
had
again
sunk
into
a
dull
and
gloomy
state
colbert
awaited
the
first
words
from
the
kings
lips
with
as
much
impatience
as
philippe
and
aramis
did
from
their
place
of
observation
are
you
aware
what
is
the
usual
and
natural
consequence
of
all
this
monsieur
colbert
said
the
king
after
a
few
moments
reflection
no
sire
i
do
not
know
well
then
the
fact
of
the
appropriation
of
the
thirteen
millions
if
it
can
be
proved
but
it
is
so
already
i
mean
if
it
were
to
be
declared
and
certified
m
colbert
i
think
it
will
be
tomorrow
if
your
majesty
were
we
not
under
m
fouquets
roof
you
were
going
to
say
perhaps
replied
the
king
with
something
of
nobility
in
his
demeanor
the
king
is
in
his
own
palace
wherever
he
may
beespecially
in
houses
which
the
royal
money
has
constructed
i
think
said
philippe
in
a
low
tone
to
aramis
that
the
architect
who
planned
this
dome
ought
anticipating
the
use
it
could
be
put
to
at
a
future
opportunity
so
to
have
contrived
that
it
might
be
made
to
fall
upon
the
heads
of
scoundrels
such
as
m
colbert
i
think
so
too
replied
aramis
but
m
colbert
is
so
very
near
the
king
at
this
moment
that
is
true
and
that
would
open
the
succession
of
which
your
younger
brother
would
reap
all
the
advantage
monseigneur
but
stay
let
us
keep
quiet
and
go
on
listening
we
shall
not
have
long
to
listen
said
the
young
prince
why
not
monseigneur
because
if
i
were
king
i
should
make
no
further
reply
and
what
would
you
do
i
should
wait
until
tomorrow
morning
to
give
myself
time
for
reflection
louis
xiv
at
last
raised
his
eyes
and
finding
colbert
attentively
waiting
for
his
next
remarks
said
hastily
changing
the
conversation
m
colbert
i
perceive
it
is
getting
very
late
and
i
shall
now
retire
to
bed
by
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
have
made
up
my
mind
very
good
sire
returned
colbert
greatly
incensed
although
he
restrained
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
king
the
king
made
a
gesture
of
adieu
and
colbert
withdrew
with
a
respectful
bow
my
attendants
cried
the
king
and
as
they
entered
the
apartment
philippe
was
about
to
quit
his
post
of
observation
a
moment
longer
said
aramis
to
him
with
his
accustomed
gentleness
of
manner
what
has
just
now
taken
place
is
only
a
detail
and
tomorrow
we
shall
have
no
occasion
to
think
anything
more
about
it
but
the
ceremony
of
the
kings
retiring
to
rest
the
etiquette
observed
in
addressing
the
king
that
indeed
is
of
the
greatest
importance
learn
sire
and
study
well
how
you
ought
to
go
to
bed

a
night

chapter
xv
colbert
history
will
tell
us
or
rather
history
has
told
us
of
the
various
events
of
the
following
day
of
the
splendid
fetes
given
by
the
surintendant
to
his
sovereign
nothing
but
amusement
and
delight
was
allowed
to
prevail
throughout
the
whole
of
the
following
day
there
was
a
promenade
a
banquet
a
comedy
to
be
acted
and
a
comedy
too
in
which
to
his
great
amazement
porthos
recognized
m
coquelin
de
voliere
as
one
of
the
actors
in
the
piece
called
les
facheux
full
of
preoccupation
however
from
the
scene
of
the
previous
evening
and
hardly
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
poison
which
colbert
had
then
administered
to
him
the
king
during
the
whole
of
the
day
so
brilliant
in
its
effects
so
full
of
unexpected
and
startling
novelties
in
which
all
the
wonders
of
the
arabian
nights
entertainments
seemed
to
be
reproduced
for
his
especial
amusementthe
king
we
say
showed
himself
cold
reserved
and
taciturn
nothing
could
smooth
the
frowns
upon
his
face
every
one
who
observed
him
noticed
that
a
deep
feeling
of
resentment
of
remote
origin
increased
by
slow
degrees
as
the
source
becomes
a
river
thanks
to
the
thousand
threads
of
water
that
increase
its
body
was
keenly
alive
in
the
depths
of
the
kings
heart
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
only
did
he
begin
to
resume
a
little
serenity
of
manner
and
by
that
time
he
had
in
all
probability
made
up
his
mind
aramis
who
followed
him
step
by
step
in
his
thoughts
as
in
his
walk
concluded
that
the
event
he
was
expecting
would
not
be
long
before
it
was
announced
this
time
colbert
seemed
to
walk
in
concert
with
the
bishop
of
vannes
and
had
he
received
for
every
annoyance
which
he
inflicted
on
the
king
a
word
of
direction
from
aramis
he
could
not
have
done
better
during
the
whole
of
the
day
the
king
who
in
all
probability
wished
to
free
himself
from
some
of
the
thoughts
which
disturbed
his
mind
seemed
to
seek
la
vallieres
society
as
actively
as
he
seemed
to
show
his
anxiety
to
flee
that
of
m
colbert
or
m
fouquet
the
evening
came
the
king
had
expressed
a
wish
not
to
walk
in
the
park
until
after
cards
in
the
evening
in
the
interval
between
supper
and
the
promenade
cards
and
dice
were
introduced
the
king
won
a
thousand
pistoles
and
having
won
them
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
then
rose
saying
and
now
gentlemen
to
the
park
he
found
the
ladies
of
the
court
were
already
there
the
king
we
have
before
observed
had
won
a
thousand
pistoles
and
had
put
them
in
his
pocket
but
m
fouquet
had
somehow
contrived
to
lose
ten
thousand
so
that
among
the
courtiers
there
was
still
left
a
hundred
and
ninety
thousand
francs
profit
to
divide
a
circumstance
which
made
the
countenances
of
the
courtiers
and
the
officers
of
the
kings
household
the
most
joyous
countenances
in
the
world
it
was
not
the
same
however
with
the
kings
face
for
notwithstanding
his
success
at
play
to
which
he
was
by
no
means
insensible
there
still
remained
a
slight
shade
of
dissatisfaction
colbert
was
waiting
for
or
upon
him
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
avenues
he
was
most
probably
waiting
there
in
consequence
of
a
rendezvous
which
had
been
given
him
by
the
king
as
louis
xiv
who
had
avoided
him
or
who
had
seemed
to
avoid
him
suddenly
made
him
a
sign
and
they
then
struck
into
the
depths
of
the
park
together
but
la
valliere
too
had
observed
the
kings
gloomy
aspect
and
kindling
glances
she
had
remarked
thisand
as
nothing
which
lay
hidden
or
smoldering
in
his
heart
was
hidden
from
the
gaze
of
her
affection
she
understood
that
this
repressed
wrath
menaced
some
one
she
prepared
to
withstand
the
current
of
his
vengeance
and
intercede
like
an
angel
of
mercy
overcome
by
sadness
nervously
agitated
deeply
distressed
at
having
been
so
long
separated
from
her
lover
disturbed
at
the
sight
of
the
emotion
she
had
divined
she
accordingly
presented
herself
to
the
king
with
an
embarrassed
aspect
which
in
his
then
disposition
of
mind
the
king
interpreted
unfavorably
then
as
they
were
alonenearly
alone
inasmuch
as
colbert
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
young
girl
approaching
had
stopped
and
drawn
back
a
dozen
pacesthe
king
advanced
towards
la
valliere
and
took
her
by
the
hand
mademoiselle
he
said
to
her
should
i
be
guilty
of
an
indiscretion
if
i
were
to
inquire
if
you
were
indisposed
for
you
seem
to
breathe
as
if
you
were
oppressed
by
some
secret
cause
of
uneasiness
and
your
eyes
are
filled
with
tears
oh
sire
if
i
be
indeed
so
and
if
my
eyes
are
indeed
full
of
tears
i
am
sorrowful
only
at
the
sadness
which
seems
to
oppress
your
majesty
my
sadness
you
are
mistaken
mademoiselle
no
it
is
not
sadness
i
experience
what
is
it
then
sire
humiliation
humiliation
oh
sire
what
a
word
for
you
to
use
i
mean
mademoiselle
that
wherever
i
may
happen
to
be
no
one
else
ought
to
be
the
master
well
then
look
round
you
on
every
side
and
judge
whether
i
am
not
eclipsedi
the
king
of
francebefore
the
monarch
of
these
wide
domains
oh
he
continued
clenching
his
hands
and
teeth
when
i
think
that
this
king
well
sire
said
louise
terrified
that
this
king
is
a
faithless
unworthy
servant
who
grows
proud
and
selfsufficient
upon
the
strength
of
property
that
belongs
to
me
and
which
he
has
stolen
and
therefore
i
am
about
to
change
this
impudent
ministers
fete
into
sorrow
and
mourning
of
which
the
nymph
of
vaux
as
the
poets
say
shall
not
soon
lose
the
remembrance
oh
your
majesty
well
mademoiselle
are
you
about
to
take
m
fouquets
part
said
louis
impatiently
no
sire
i
will
only
ask
whether
you
are
well
informed
your
majesty
has
more
than
once
learned
the
value
of
accusations
made
at
court
louis
xiv
made
a
sign
for
colbert
to
approach
speak
monsieur
colbert
said
the
young
prince
for
i
almost
believe
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
has
need
of
your
assistance
before
she
can
put
any
faith
in
the
kings
word
tell
mademoiselle
what
m
fouquet
has
done
and
you
mademoiselle
will
perhaps
have
the
kindness
to
listen
it
will
not
be
long
why
did
louis
xiv
insist
upon
it
in
such
a
manner
a
very
simple
reasonhis
heart
was
not
at
rest
his
mind
was
not
thoroughly
convinced
he
imagined
there
lay
some
dark
hidden
tortuous
intrigue
behind
these
thirteen
millions
of
francs
and
he
wished
that
the
pure
heart
of
la
valliere
which
had
revolted
at
the
idea
of
theft
or
robbery
should
approveeven
were
it
only
by
a
single
wordthe
resolution
he
had
taken
and
which
nevertheless
he
hesitated
before
carrying
into
execution
speak
monsieur
said
la
valliere
to
colbert
who
had
advanced
speak
since
the
king
wishes
me
to
listen
to
you
tell
me
what
is
the
crime
with
which
m
fouquet
is
charged
oh
not
very
heinous
mademoiselle
he
returned
a
mere
abuse
of
confidence
speak
speak
colbert
and
when
you
have
related
it
leave
us
and
go
and
inform
m
dartagnan
that
i
have
certain
orders
to
give
him
m
dartagnan
sire
exclaimed
la
valliere
but
why
send
for
m
dartagnan
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
pardieu
in
order
to
arrest
this
haughty
arrogant
titan
who
true
to
his
menace
threatens
to
scale
my
heaven
arrest
m
fouquet
do
you
say
ah
does
that
surprise
you
in
his
own
house
why
not
if
he
be
guilty
he
is
as
guilty
in
his
own
house
as
anywhere
else
m
fouquet
who
at
this
moment
is
ruining
himself
for
his
sovereign
in
plain
truth
mademoiselle
it
seems
as
if
you
were
defending
this
traitor
colbert
began
to
chuckle
silently
the
king
turned
round
at
the
sound
of
this
suppressed
mirth
sire
said
la
valliere
it
is
not
m
fouquet
i
am
defending
it
is
yourself
me
you
are
defending
me
sire
you
would
dishonor
yourself
if
you
were
to
give
such
an
order
dishonor
myself
murmured
the
king
turning
pale
with
anger
in
plain
truth
mademoiselle
you
show
a
strange
persistence
in
what
you
say
if
i
do
sire
my
only
motive
is
that
of
serving
your
majesty
replied
the
noblehearted
girl
for
that
i
would
risk
i
would
sacrifice
my
very
life
without
the
least
reserve
colbert
seemed
inclined
to
grumble
and
complain
la
valliere
that
timid
gentle
lamb
turned
round
upon
him
and
with
a
glance
like
lightning
imposed
silence
upon
him
monsieur
she
said
when
the
king
acts
well
whether
in
doing
so
he
does
either
myself
or
those
who
belong
to
me
an
injury
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
were
the
king
to
confer
a
benefit
either
upon
me
or
mine
and
if
he
acted
badly
i
should
tell
him
so
but
it
appears
to
me
mademoiselle
colbert
ventured
to
say
that
i
too
love
the
king
yes
monseigneur
we
both
love
him
but
each
in
a
different
manner
replied
la
valliere
with
such
an
accent
that
the
heart
of
the
young
king
was
powerfully
affected
by
it
i
love
him
so
deeply
that
the
whole
world
is
aware
of
it
so
purely
that
the
king
himself
does
not
doubt
my
affection
he
is
my
king
and
my
master
i
am
the
least
of
all
his
servants
but
whoso
touches
his
honor
assails
my
life
therefore
i
repeat
that
they
dishonor
the
king
who
advise
him
to
arrest
m
fouquet
under
his
own
roof
colbert
hung
down
his
head
for
he
felt
that
the
king
had
abandoned
him
however
as
he
bent
his
head
he
murmured
mademoiselle
i
have
only
one
word
to
say
do
not
say
it
then
monsieur
for
i
would
not
listen
to
it
besides
what
could
you
have
to
tell
me
that
m
fouquet
has
been
guilty
of
certain
crimes
i
believe
he
has
because
the
king
has
said
so
and
from
the
moment
the
king
said
i
think
so
i
have
no
occasion
for
other
lips
to
say
i
affirm
it
but
were
m
fouquet
the
vilest
of
men
i
should
say
aloud
m
fouquets
person
is
sacred
to
the
king
because
he
is
the
guest
of
m
fouquet
were
his
house
a
den
of
thieves
were
vaux
a
cave
of
coiners
or
robbers
his
home
is
sacred
his
palace
is
inviolable
since
his
wife
is
living
in
it
and
that
is
an
asylum
which
even
executioners
would
not
dare
to
violate
la
valliere
paused
and
was
silent
in
spite
of
himself
the
king
could
not
but
admire
her
he
was
overpowered
by
the
passionate
energy
of
her
voice
by
the
nobleness
of
the
cause
she
advocated
colbert
yielded
overcome
by
the
inequality
of
the
struggle
at
last
the
king
breathed
again
more
freely
shook
his
head
and
held
out
his
hand
to
la
valliere
mademoiselle
he
said
gently
why
do
you
decide
against
me
do
you
know
what
this
wretched
fellow
will
do
if
i
give
him
time
to
breathe
again
is
he
not
a
prey
which
will
always
be
within
your
grasp
should
he
escape
and
take
to
flight
exclaimed
colbert
well
monsieur
it
will
always
remain
on
record
to
the
kings
eternal
honor
that
he
allowed
m
fouquet
to
flee
and
the
more
guilty
he
may
have
been
the
greater
will
the
kings
honor
and
glory
appear
compared
with
such
unnecessary
misery
and
shame
louis
kissed
la
vallieres

as
he
knelt
before
her

colbert
then
suddenly
his
face
brightened
up
again
oh
no
no

he
said
to
himself
and
while
the

from

by
the
thick
covert
of
an
enormous
lime
pressed
la
valliere
to
his
breast
with
all
the
ardor
of
ineffable
affection
colbert
tranquilly
fumbled
among
the
papers
in
his
pocketbook
and
drew
out
of
it
a
paper
folded
in
the
form
of
a
letter
somewhat
yellow
perhaps
but
one
that
must
have
been
most
precious
since
the
intendant
smiled
as
he
looked
at
it
he
then
bent
a
look
full
of
hatred
upon
the
charming
group
which
the
young
girl
and
the
king
formed
togethera
group

for
a
moment
as

of

rapidly
among

trees
and
then
as
the
king
who
had
been
on
his
knees
before
the
young
girl
was
rising
from

the

up

crumpling
it
in
his

as
he
did
so
and
at
the

the

the

displayed

the

ovation
paid
to

arrived
in
time
to
suspend
the
effect
of
a
resolution
which
la
valliere
had
already
considerably
shaken
in
louis
xivs
heart
he
looked
at
fouquet
with
a
feeling
almost
of
gratitude
for
having
given
la
valliere
an
opportunity
of
showing
herself
so
generously
disposed
so
powerful
in
the
influence
she
exercised
over
his
heart
the
moment
of
the
last
and
greatest
display
had
arrived
hardly
had
fouquet
conducted
the
king
towards
the
chateau
when
a
mass
of
fire
burst
from
the
dome
of
vaux
with
a
prodigious
uproar
pouring
a
flood
of
dazzling
cataracts
of
rays
on
every
side
and
illumining
the
remotest
corners
of
the
gardens
the
fireworks
began
colbert
at
twenty
paces
from
the
king
who
was
surrounded
and
feted
by
the
owner
of
vaux
seemed
by
the
obstinate
persistence
of
his
gloomy
thoughts
to
do
his
utmost
to
recall
louiss
attention
which
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
was
already
in
his
opinion
too
easily
diverting
suddenly
just
as
louis
was
on
the
point
of
holding
it
out
to
fouquet
he
perceived
in
his
hand
the
paper
which
as
he
believed
la
valliere
had
dropped
at
his
feet
as
she
hurried
away
the
still
stronger
magnet
of
love
drew
the
young
princes
attention
towards
the
souvenir
of
his
idol
and
by
the
brilliant
light
which
increased
momentarily
in
beauty
and
drew
from
the
neighboring
villages
loud
cheers
of
admiration
the
king
read
the
letter
which
he
supposed
was
a
loving
and
tender
epistle
la
valliere
had
destined
for
him
but
as
he
read
it
a
deathlike
pallor
stole
over
his
face
and
an
expression
of
deepseated
wrath
illumined
by
the
manycolored
fire
which
gleamed
so
brightly
soaringly
around
the
scene
produced
a
terrible
spectacle
which
every
one
would
have
shuddered
at
could
they
only
have
read
into
his
heart
now
torn
by
the
most
stormy
and
most
bitter
passions
there
was
no
truce
for
him
now
influenced
as
he
was
by
jealousy
and
mad
passion
from
the
very
moment
when
the
dark
truth
was
revealed
to
him
every
gentler
feeling
seemed
to
disappear
pity
kindness
of
consideration
the
religion
of
hospitality
all
were
forgotten
in
the
bitter
pang
which
wrung
his
heart
he
still
too
weak
to
hide
his
sufferings
was
almost
on
the
point
of
uttering
a
cry
of
alarm
and
calling
his
guards
to
gather
round
him
this
letter
which
colbert
had
thrown
down
at
the
kings
feet
the
reader
has
doubtlessly
guessed
was
the
same
that
had
disappeared
with
the
porter
toby
at
fontainebleau
after
the
attempt
which
fouquet
had
made
upon
la
vallieres
heart
fouquet
saw
the
kings
pallor
and
was
far
from
guessing
the
evil
colbert
saw
the
kings
anger
and
rejoiced
inwardly
at
the
approach
of
the
storm
fouquets
voice
drew
the
young
prince
from
his
wrathful
reverie
what
is
the
matter
sire
inquired
the
superintendent
with
an
expression
of
graceful
interest
louis
made
a
violent
effort
over
himself
as
he
replied
nothing
i
am
afraid
your
majesty
is
suffering
i
am
suffering
and
have
already
told
you
so
monsieur
but
it
is
nothing
and
the
king
without
waiting
for
the
termination
of
the
fireworks
turned
towards
the
chateau
fouquet
accompanied
him
and
the
whole
court
followed
leaving
the
remains
of
the
fireworks
consuming
for
their
own
amusement
the
superintendent
endeavored
again
to
question
louis
xiv
but
did
not
succeed
in
obtaining
a
reply
he
imagined
there
had
been
some
misunderstanding
between
louis
and
la
valliere
in
the
park
which
had
resulted
in
a
slight
quarrel
and
that
the
king
who
was
not
ordinarily
sulky
by
disposition
but
completely
absorbed
by
his
passion
for
la
valliere
had
taken
a
dislike
to
every
one
because
his
mistress
had
shown
herself
offended
with
him
this
idea
was
sufficient
to
console
him
he
had
even
a
friendly
and
kindly
smile
for
the
young
king
when
the
latter
wished
him
good
night
this
however
was
not
all
the
king
had
to
submit
to
he
was
obliged
to
undergo
the
usual
ceremony
which
on
that
evening
was
marked
by
close
adherence
to
the
strictest
etiquette
the
next
day
was
the
one
fixed
for
the
departure
it
was
but
proper
that
the
guests
should
thank
their
host
and
show
him
a
little
attention
in
return
for
the
expenditure
of
his
twelve
millions
the
only
remark
approaching
to
amiability
which
the
king
could
find
to
say
to
m
fouquet
as
he
took
leave
of
him
were
in
these
words
m
fouquet
you
shall
hear
from
me
be
good
enough
to
desire
m
dartagnan
to
come
here
but
the
blood
of
louis
xiv
who
had
so
profoundly
dissimulated
his
feelings
boiled
in
his
veins
and
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
order
m
fouquet
to
be
put
an
end
to
with
the
same
readiness
indeed
as
his
predecessor
had
caused
the
assassination
of
le
marechal
dancre
and
so
he
disguised
the
terrible
resolution
he
had
formed
beneath
one
of
those
royal
smiles
which
like
lightningflashes
indicated
coups
detat
fouquet
took
the
kings
hand
and
kissed
it
louis
shuddered
throughout
his
whole
frame
but
allowed
m
fouquet
to
touch
his
hand
with
his
lips
five
minutes
afterwards
dartagnan
to
whom
the
royal
order
had
been
communicated
entered
louis
xivs
apartment
aramis
and
philippe
were
in
theirs
still
eagerly
attentive
and
still
listening
with
all
their
ears
the
king
did
not
even
give
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
time
to
approach
his
armchair
but
ran
forward
to
meet
him
take
care
he
exclaimed
that
no
one
enters
here
very
good
sire
replied
the
captain
whose
glance
had
for
a
long
time
past
analyzed
the
stormy
indications
on
the
royal
countenance
he
gave
the
necessary
order
at
the
door
but
returning
to
the
king
he
said
is
there
something
fresh
the
matter
your
majesty
how
many
men
have
you
here
inquired
the
king
without
making
any
other
reply
to
the
question
addressed
to
him
what
for
sire
how
many
men
have
you
i
say
repeated
the
king
stamping
upon
the
ground
with
his
foot
i
have
the
musketeers
well
and
what
others
twenty
guards
and
thirteen
swiss
how
many
men
will
be
required
to
to
do
what
sire
replied
the
musketeer
opening
his
large
calm
eyes
to
arrest
m
fouquet
dartagnan
fell
back
a
step
to
arrest
m
fouquet
he
burst
forth
are
you
going
to
tell
me
that
it
is
impossible
exclaimed
the
king
in
tones
of
cold
vindictive
passion
i
never
say
that
anything
is
impossible
replied
dartagnan
wounded
to
the
quick
very
well
do
it
then
dartagnan
turned
on
his
heel
and
made
his
way
towards
the
door
it
was
but
a
short
distance
and
he
cleared
it
in
half
a
dozen
paces
when
he
reached
it
he
suddenly
paused
and
said
your
majesty
will
forgive
me
but
in
order
to
effect
this
arrest
i
should
like
written
directions
for
what
purposeand
since
when
has
the
kings
word
been
insufficient
for
you
because
the
word
of
a
king
when
it
springs
from
a
feeling
of
anger
may
possibly
change
when
the
feeling
changes
a
truce
to
set
phrases
monsieur
you
have
another
thought
besides
that
oh
i
at
least
have
certain
thoughts
and
ideas
which
unfortunately
others
have
not
dartagnan
replied
impertinently
the
king
in
the
tempest
of
his
wrath
hesitated
and
drew
back
in
the
face
of
dartagnans
frank
courage
just
as
a
horse
crouches
on
his
haunches
under
the
strong
hand
of
a
bold
and
experienced
rider
what
is
your
thought
he
exclaimed
this
sire
replied
dartagnan
you
cause
a
man
to
be
arrested
when
you
are
still
under
his
roof
and
passion
is
alone
the
cause
of
that
when
your
anger
shall
have
passed
you
will
regret
what
you
have
done
and
then
i
wish
to
be
in
a
position
to
show
you
your
signature
if
that
however
should
fail
to
be
a
reparation
it
will
at
least
show
us
that
the
king
was
wrong
to
lose
his
temper
wrong
to
lose
his
temper
cried
the
king
in
a
loud
passionate
voice
did
not
my
father
my
grandfathers
too
before
me
lose
their
temper
at
times
in
heavens
name
the
king
your
father
and
the
king
your
grandfather
never
lost
their
temper
except
when
under
the
protection
of
their
own
palace
the
king
is
master
wherever
he
may
be
that
is
a
flattering
complimentary
phrase
which
cannot
proceed
from
any
one
but
m
colbert
but
it
happens
not
to
be
the
truth
the
king
is
at
home
in
every
mans
house
when
he
has
driven
its
owner
out
of
it
the
king
bit
his
lips
but
said
nothing
can
it
be
possible
said
dartagnan
here
is
a
man
who
is
positively
ruining
himself
in
order
to
please
you
and
you
wish
to
have
him
arrested
mordioux
sire
if
my
name
was
fouquet
and
people
treated
me
in
that
manner
i
would
swallow
at
a
single
gulp
all
sorts
of
fireworks
and
other
things
and
i
would
set
fire
to
them
and
send
myself
and
everybody
else
in
blownup
atoms
to
the
sky
but
it
is
all
the
same
it
is
your
wish
and
it
shall
be
done
go
said
the
king
but
have
you
men
enough
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
take
a
whole
host
to
help
me
arrest
m
fouquet
why
that
is
so
easy
that
a
very
child
might
do
it
it
is
like
drinking
a
glass
of
wormwood
one
makes
an
ugly
face
and
that
is
all
if
he
defends
himself
he
it
is
not
at
all
likely
defend
himself
when
such
extreme
harshness
as
you
are
going
to
practice
makes
the
man
a
very
martyr
nay
i
am
sure
that
if
he
has
a
million
of
francs
left
which
i
very
much
doubt
he
would
be
willing
enough
to
give
it
in
order
to
have
such
a
termination
as
this
but
what
does
that
matter
it
shall
be
done
at
once
stay
said
the
king
do
not
make
his
arrest
a
public
affair
that
will
be
more
difficult
why
so
because
nothing
is
easier
than
to
go
up
to
m
fouquet
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
enthusiastic
guests
who
surround
him
and
say
in
the
kings
name
i
arrest
you
but
to
go
up
to
him
to
turn
him
first
one
way
and
then
another
to
drive
him
up
into
one
of
the
corners
of
the
chessboard
in
such
a
way
that
he
cannot
escape
to
take
him
away
from
his
guests
and
keep
him
a
prisoner
for
you
without
one
of
them
alas
having
heard
anything
about
it
that
indeed
is
a
genuine
difficulty
the
greatest
of
all
in
truth
and
i
hardly
see
how
it
is
to
be
done
you
had
better
say
it
is
impossible
and
you
will
have
finished
much
sooner
heaven
help
me
but
i
seem
to
be
surrounded
by
people
who
prevent
me
doing
what
i
wish
i
do
not
prevent
your
doing
anything
have
you
indeed
decided
take
care
of
m
fouquet
until
i
shall
have
made
up
my
mind
by
tomorrow
morning
that
shall
be
done
sire
and
return
when
i
rise
in
the
morning
for
further
orders
and
now
leave
me
to
myself
you
do
not
even
want
m
colbert
then
said
the
musketeer
firing
his
last
shot
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
the
king
started
with
his
whole
mind
fixed
on
the
thought
of
revenge
he
had
forgotten
the
cause
and
substance
of
the
offense
no
no
one
he
said
no
one
here
leave
me
dartagnan
quitted
the
room
the
king
closed
the
door
with
his
own
hands
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
his
apartment
at
a
furious
pace
like
a
wounded
bull
in
an
arena
trailing
from
his
horn
the
colored
streamers
and
the
iron
darts
at
last
he
began
to
take
comfort
in
the
expression
of
his
violent
feelings
miserable
wretch
that
he
is
not
only
does
he
squander
my
finances
but
with
his
illgotten
plunder
he
corrupts
secretaries
friends
generals
artists
and
all
and
tries
to
rob
me
of
the
one
to
whom
i
am
most
attached
this
is
the
reason
that
perfidious
girl
so
boldly
took
his
part
gratitude
and

he
gave
himself
up
for
a
moment
to
the
bitterest
reflections
a
satyr
he
thought
with
that
abhorrent
hate
with
which
young
men
regard
those
more
advanced
in
life
who
still
think
of
love
a
man
who
has
never
found
opposition
or
resistance
in
any
one
who
lavishes
his
gold
and
jewels
in
every
direction
and
who
retains
his
staff
of
painters
in
order
to
take
the
portraits
of
his
mistresses

the

trembled
with
passion
as
he
continued
he
pollutes
and
profanes
everything
that
belongs
to
me
he
destroys
everything
that
is
mine
he
will
be
my
death

i
know
that
man
is
too
much
for
me
he
is
my
mortal
enemy

he
shall
forthwith
fall

and
as
he
pronounced
these
words
he
struck
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
which
he
was
sitting
violently
over
and
over
again
and
then
rose
like
one
in
an
epileptic
fit

murmured
when
the
sun
rises
no
other
rival
shall
that
brilliant
king
of
space
possess
but
me
that
man
shall
fall
so
low
that
when
people
look
at
the
abject
ruin
my
anger
shall
have
wrought
they
will
be
forced
to
confess
at
last

at

that
i
am
indeed
greater
than
he
the
king

was
incapable
of
mastering
his
emotions
any

over
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
a
small
table
placed
close
to
his
bedside
and
in
the
very
bitterness
of
anger
almost
weeping
and
halfsuffocated
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
dressed
as
he
was
and
bit
the
sheets
in
his
extremity
of
passion
trying
to
find
repose
of
body
at
least
there
the
bed
creaked
beneath
his
weight
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
broken
sounds
emerging
or
one
might

exploding
from
his

subsided
into

for

convulsively
on
his

his
nerveless

fell
quietly
down
his

lay
languidly
on
his
pillow
his
limbs
exhausted
with
excessive
emotion
still
trembled
occasionally
agitated
by
muscular
contractions
while
from
his
breast
faint
and
infrequent
sighs
still
issued
morpheus
the
tutelary
deity
of
the
apartment
towards
whom
louis
raised
his
eyes
wearied
by
his
anger
and
reconciled
by
his
tears
showered
down
upon
him
the
sleepinducing
poppies
with
which
his
hands
are
ever
filled
so
presently
the
monarch
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
then
it
seemed
to
him
as
it
often
happens
in
that
first
sleep
so
light
and
gentle
which
raises
the
body
above
the
couch
and
the
soul
above
the
earthit
seemed
to
him
we
say
as
if
the
god
morpheus
painted
on
the
ceiling
looked
at
him
with
eyes
resembling
human
eyes
that
something
shone
brightly
and
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
dome
above
the
sleeper
that
the
crowd
of
terrible
dreams
which
thronged
together
in
his
brain
and
which
were
interrupted
for
a
moment
half
revealed
a
human
face
with
a
hand
resting
against
the
mouth
and
in
an
attitude
of
deep
and
absorbed
meditation
and
strange
enough
too
this
man
bore
so
wonderful
a
resemblance
to
the
king
himself
that
louis
fancied
he
was
looking
at
his
own
face
reflected
in
a
mirror
with
the
exception
however
that
the
face
was
saddened
by
a
feeling
of
the
profoundest
pity
then
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
dome
gradually
retired
escaping
from
his
gaze
and
that
the
figures
and
attributes
painted
by
lebrun
became
darker
and
darker
as
the
distance
became
more
and
more
remote
a
gentle
easy
movement
as
regular
as
that
by
which
a
vessel
plunges
beneath
the
waves
had
succeeded
to
the
immovableness
of
the
bed
doubtless
the
king
was
dreaming
and
in
this
dream
the
crown
of
gold
which
fastened
the
curtains
together
seemed
to
recede
from
his
vision
just
as
the
dome
to
which
it
remained
suspended
had
done
so
that
the
winged
genius
which
with
both
its
hand
supported
the
crown
seemed
though
vainly
so
to
call
upon
the
king
who
was
fast
disappearing
from
it
the
bed
still
sunk
louis
with
his
eyes
open
could
not
resist
the
deception
of
this
cruel
hallucination
at
last
as
the
light
of
the
royal
chamber
faded
away
into
darkness
and
gloom
something
cold
gloomy
and
inexplicable
in
its
nature
seemed
to
infect
the
air
no
paintings
nor
gold
nor
velvet
hangings
were
visible
any
longer
nothing
but
walls
of
a
dull
gray
color
which
the
increasing
gloom
made
darker
every
moment
and
yet
the
bed
still
continued
to
descend
and
after
a
minute
which
seemed
in
its
duration
almost
an
age
to
the
king
it
reached
a
stratum
of
air
black
and
chill
as
death
and
then
it
stopped
the
king
could
no
longer
see
the
light
in
his
room
except
as
from
the
bottom
of
a
well
we
can
see
the
light
of
day
i
am
under
the
influence
of
some
atrocious
dream
he
thought
it
is
time
to
awaken
from
it
come
let
me
wake
every
one
has
experienced
the
sensation
the
above
remark
conveys
there
is
hardly
a
person
who
in
the
midst
of
a
nightmare
whose
influence
is
suffocating
has
not
said
to
himself
by
the
help
of
that
light
which
still
burns
in
the
brain
when
every
human
light
is
extinguished
it
is
nothing
but
a
dream
after
all
this
was
precisely
what
louis
xiv
said
to
himself
but
when
he
said
come
come
wake
up
he
perceived
that
not
only
was
he
already
awake
but
still
more
that
he
had
his
eyes
open
also
and
then
he
looked
all
round
him
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
two
armed
men
stood
in
stolid
silence
each
wrapped
in
a
huge
cloak
and
the
face
covered
with
a
mask
one
of
them
held
a
small
lamp
in
his
hand
whose
glimmering
light
revealed
the
saddest
picture
a
king
could
look
upon
louis
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
that
his
dream
still
lasted
and
that
all
he
had
to
do
to
cause
it
to
disappear
was
to
move
his
arms
or
to
say
something
aloud
he
darted
from
his
bed
and
found
himself
upon
the
damp
moist
ground
then
addressing
himself
to
the
man
who
held
the
lamp
in
his
hand
he
said
what
is
this
monsieur
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
jest
it
is
no
jest
replied
in
a
deep
voice
the
masked
figure
that
held
the
lantern
do
you
belong
to
m
fouquet
inquired
the
king
greatly
astonished
at
his
situation
it
matters
very
little
to
whom
we
belong
said
the
phantom
we
are
your
masters
now
that
is
sufficient
the
king
more
impatient
than
intimidated
turned
to
the
other
masked
figure
if
this
is
a
comedy
he
said
you
will
tell
m
fouquet
that
i
find
it
unseemly
and
improper
and
that
i
command
it
should
cease
the
second
masked
person
to
whom
the
king
had
addressed
himself
was
a
man
of
huge
stature
and
vast
circumference
he
held
himself
erect
and
motionless
as
any
block
of
marble
well
added
the
king
stamping
his
foot
you
do
not
answer
we
do
not
answer
you
my
good
monsieur
said
the
giant
in
a
stentorian
voice
because
there
is
nothing
to
say
at
least
tell
me
what
you
want
exclaimed
louis
folding
his
arms
with
a
passionate
gesture
you
will
know
by
and
by
replied
the
man
who
held
the
lamp
in
the
meantime
tell
me
where
i
am
look
louis
looked
all
round
him
but
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
which
the
masked
figure
raised
for
the
purpose
he
could
perceive
nothing
but
the
damp
walls
which
glistened
here
and
there
with
the
slimy
traces
of
the
snail
ohoha
dungeon
cried
the
king
no
a
subterranean
passage
which
leads
will
you
be
good
enough
to
follow
us
i
shall
not
stir
from
hence
cried
the
king
if
you
are
obstinate
my
dear
young
friend
replied
the
taller
of
the
two
i
will
lift
you
up
in
my
arms
and
roll
you
up
in
your
own
cloak
and
if
you
should
happen
to
be
stifled
whyso
much
the
worse
for
you
as
he
said
this
he
disengaged
from
beneath
his
cloak
a
hand
of
which
milo
of
crotona
would
have
envied
him
the
possession
on
the
day
when
he
had
that
unhappy
idea
of
rending
his
last
oak
the
king
dreaded
violence
for
he
could
well
believe
that
the
two
men
into
whose
power
he
had
fallen
had
not
gone
so
far
with
any
idea
of
drawing
back
and
that
they
would
consequently
be
ready
to
proceed
to
extremities
if
necessary
he
shook
his
head
and
said
it
seems
i
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
couple
of
assassins
move
on
then
neither
of
the
men
answered
a
word
to
this
remark
the
one
who
carried
the
lantern
walked
first
the
king
followed
him
while
the
second
masked
figure
closed
the
procession
in
this
manner
they
passed
along
a
winding
gallery
of
some
length
with
as
many
staircases
leading
out
of
it
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
mysterious
and
gloomy
palaces
of
ann
radcliffes
creation
all
these
windings
and
turnings
during
which
the
king
heard
the
sound
of
running
water
over
his
head
ended
at
last
in
a
long
corridor
closed
by
an
iron
door
the
figure
with
the
lamp
opened
the
door
with
one
of
the
keys
he
wore
suspended
at
his
girdle
where
during
the
whole
of
the
brief
journey
the
king
had
heard
them
rattle
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
and
admitted
the
air
louis
recognized
the
balmy
odors
that
trees
exhale
in
hot
summer
nights
he
paused
hesitatingly
for
a
moment
or
two
but
the
huge
sentinel
who
followed
him
thrust
him
out
of
the
subterranean
passage
another
blow
said
the
king
turning
towards
the
one
who
had
just
had
the
audacity
to
touch
his
sovereign
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
the
king
of
france
try
to
forget
that
word
replied
the
man
with
the
lamp
in
a
tone
which
as
little
admitted
of
a
reply
as
one
of
the
famous
decrees
of
minos
you
deserve
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
for
the
words
that
you
have
just
made
use
of
said
the
giant
as
he
extinguished
the
lamp
his
companion
handed
to
him
but
the
king
is
too
kindhearted
louis
at
that
threat
made
so
sudden
a
movement
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
meditated
flight
but
the
giants
hand
was
in
a
moment
placed
on
his
shoulder
and
fixed
him
motionless
where
he
stood
but
tell
me
at
least
where
we
are
going
said
the
king
come
replied
the
former
of
the
two
men
with
a
kind
of
respect
in
his
manner
and
leading
his
prisoner
towards
a
carriage
which
seemed
to
be
in
waiting
the
carriage
was
completely
concealed
amid
the
trees
two
horses
with
their
feet
fettered
were
fastened
by
a
halter
to
the
lower
branches
of
a
large
oak
get
in
said
the
same
man
opening
the
carriagedoor
and
letting
down
the
step
the
king
obeyed
seated
himself
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
the
padded
door
of
which
was
shut
and
locked
immediately
upon
him
and
his
guide
as
for
the
giant
he
cut
the
fastenings
by
which
the
horses
were
bound
harnessed
them
himself
and
mounted
on
the
box
of
the
carriage
which
was
unoccupied
the
carriage
set
off
immediately
at
a
quick
trot
turned
into
the
road
to
paris
and
in
the
forest
of
senart
found
a
relay
of
horses
fastened
to
the
trees
in
the
same
manner
the
first
horses
had
been
and
without
a
postilion
the
man
on
the
box
changed
the
horses
and
continued
to
follow
the
road
towards
paris
with
the
same
rapidity
so
that
they
entered
the
city
about
three
oclock
in
the
morning
they
carriage
proceeded
along
the
faubourg
saintantoine
and
after
having
called
out
to
the
sentinel
by
the
kings
order
the
driver
conducted
the
horses
into
the
circular
inclosure
of
the
bastile
looking
out
upon
the
courtyard
called
la
cour
du
gouvernement
there
the
horses
drew
up
reeking
with
sweat
at
the
flight
of
steps
and
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
ran
forward
go
and
wake
the
governor
said
the
coachman
in
a
voice
of
thunder
with
the
exception
of
this
voice
which
might
have
been
heard
at
the
entrance
of
the
faubourg
saintantoine
everything
remained
as
calm
in
the
carriage
as
in
the
prison
ten
minutes
afterwards
m
de
baisemeaux
appeared
in
his
dressinggown
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
what
is
the
matter
now
he
asked
and
whom
have
you
brought
me
there
the
man
with
the
lantern
opened
the
carriagedoor
and
said
two
or
three
words
to
the
one
who
acted
as
driver
who
immediately
got
down
from
his
seat
took
up
a
short
musket
which
he
kept
under
his
feet
and
placed
its
muzzle
on
his
prisoners
chest
and
fire
at
once
if
he
speaks
added
aloud
the
man
who
alighted
from
the
carriage
very
good
replied
his
companion
without
another
remark
with
this
recommendation
the
person
who
had
accompanied
the
king
in
the
carriage
ascended
the
flight
of
steps
at
the
top
of
which
the
governor
was
awaiting
him
monsieur
dherblay
said
the
latter
hush
said
aramis
let
us
go
into
your
room
good
heavens
what
brings
you
here
at
this
hour
a
mistake
my
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
aramis
replied
quietly
it
appears
that
you
were
quite
right
the
other
day
what
about
inquired
the
governor
about
the
order
of
release
my
dear
friend
tell
me
what
you
mean
monsieurno
monseigneur
said
the
governor
almost
suffocated
by
surprise
and
terror
it
is
a
very
simple
affair
you
remember
dear
m
de
baisemeaux
that
an
order
of
release
was
sent
to
you
yes
for
marchiali
very
good
we
both
thought
that
it
was
for
marchiali
certainly
you
will
recollect
however
that
i
would
not
credit
it
but
that
you
compelled
me
to
believe
it
oh
baisemeaux
my
good
fellow
what
a
word
to
make
use
ofstrongly
recommended
that
was
all
strongly
recommended
yes
strongly
recommended
to
give
him
up
to
you
and
that
you
carried
him
off
with
you
in
your
carriage
well
my
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
it
was
a
mistake
it
was
discovered
at
the
ministry
so
that
i
now
bring
you
an
order
from
the
king
to
set
at
liberty
seldonthat
poor
seldon
fellow
you
know
seldon
are
you
sure
this
time
well
read
it
yourself
added
aramis
handing
him
the
order
why
said
baisemeaux
this
order
is
the
very
same
that
has
already
passed
through
my
hands
indeed
it
is
the
very
one
i
assured
you
i
saw
the
other
evening
parbleu
i
recognize
it
by
the
blot
of
ink
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
that
but
all
i
know
is
that
i
bring
it
for
you
but
then
what
about
the
other
what
other
marchiali
i
have
got
him
here
with
me
but
that
is
not
enough
for
me
i
require
a
new
order
to
take
him
back
again
dont
talk
such
nonsense
my
dear
baisemeaux
you
talk
like
a
child
where
is
the
order
you
received
respecting
marchiali
baisemeaux
ran
to
his
iron
chest
and
took
it
out
aramis
seized
hold
of
it
coolly
tore
it
in
four
pieces
held
them
to
the
lamp
and
burnt
them
good
heavens
what
are
you
doing
exclaimed
baisemeaux
in
an
extremity
of
terror
look
at
your
position
quietly
my
good
governor
said
aramis
with
imperturbable
selfpossession
and
you
will
see
how
very
simple
the
whole
affair
is
you
no
longer
possess
any
order
justifying
marchialis
release
i
am
a
lost
man
far
from
it
my
good
fellow
since
i
have
brought
marchiali
back
to
you
and
all
accordingly
is
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
never
left
ah
said
the
governor
completely
overcome
by
terror
plain
enough
you
see
and
you
will
go
and
shut
him
up
immediately
i
should
think
so
indeed
and
you
will
hand
over
this
seldon
to
me
whose
liberation
is
authorized
by
this
order
do
you
understand
ii
you
do
understand
i
see
said
aramis
very
good
baisemeaux
clapped
his
hands
together
but
why
at
all
events
after
having
taken
marchiali
away
from
me
do
you
bring
him
back
again
cried
the
unhappy
governor
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
and
completely
dumbfounded
for
a
friend
such
as
you
are
said
aramisfor
so
devoted
a
servant
i
have
no
secrets
and
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
baisemeauxs
ear
as
he
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
you
know
the
resemblance
between
that
unfortunate
fellow
and
and
the
kingyes
very
good
the
first
use
that
marchiali
made
of
his
liberty
was
to
persistcan
you
guess
what
how
is
it
likely
i
should
guess
to
persist
in
saying
that
he
was
king
of
france
to
dress
himself
up
in
clothes
like
those
of
the
king
and
then
pretend
to
assume
that
he
was
the
king
himself
gracious
heavens
that
is
the
reason
why
i
have
brought
him
back
again
my
dear
friend
he
is
mad
and
lets
every
one
see
how
mad
he
is
what
is
to
be
done
then
that
is
very
simple
let
no
one
hold
any
communication
with
him
you
understand
that
when
his
peculiar
style
of
madness
came
to
the
kings
ears
the
king
who
had
pitied
his
terrible
affliction
and
saw
that
all
his
kindness
had
been
repaid
by
black
ingratitude
became
perfectly
furious
so
that
nowand
remember
this
very
distinctly
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
for
it
concerns
you
most
closelyso
that
there
is
now
i
repeat
sentence
of
death
pronounced
against
all
those
who
may
allow
him
to
communicate
with
any
one
else
but
me
or
the
king
himself
you
understand
baisemeaux
sentence
of
death
you
need
not
ask
me
whether
i
understand
and
now
let
us
go
down
and
conduct
this
poor
devil
back
to
his
dungeon
again
unless
you
prefer
he
should
come
up
here
what
would
be
the
good
of
that
it
would
be
better
perhaps
to
enter
his
name
in
the
prisonbook
at
once
of
course
certainly
not
a
doubt
of
it
in
that
case
have
him
up
baisemeaux
ordered
the
drums
to
be
beaten
and
the
bell
to
be
rung
as
a
warning
to
every
one
to
retire
in
order
to
avoid
meeting
a
prisoner
about
whom
it
was
desired
to
observe
a
certain
mystery
then
when
the
passages
were
free
he
went
to
take
the
prisoner
from
the
carriage
at
whose
breast
porthos
faithful
to
the
directions
which
had
been
given
him
still
kept
his
musket
leveled
ah
is
that
you
miserable
wretch
cried
the
governor
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
king
very
good
very
good
and
immediately
making
the
king
get
out
of
the
carriage
he
led
him
still
accompanied
by
porthos
who
had
not
taken
off
his
mask
and
aramis
who
again
resumed
his
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
bertaudiere
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
philippe
for
six
long
years
had
bemoaned
his
existence
the
king
entered
the
cell
without
pronouncing
a
single
word
he
faltered
in
as
limp
and
haggard
as
a
rainstruck
lily
baisemeaux
shut
the
door
upon
him
turned
the
key
twice
in
the
lock
and
then
returned
to
aramis
it
is
quite
true
he
said
in
a
low
tone
that
he
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
king
but
less
so
than
you
said
so
that
said
aramis
you
would
not
have
been
deceived
by
the
substitution
of
the
one
for
the
other
what
a
question
you
are
a
most
valuable
fellow
baisemeaux
said
aramis
and
now
set
seldon
free
oh
yes
i
was
going
to
forget
that
i
will
go
and
give
orders
at
once
bah
tomorrow
will
be
time
enough
tomorrowoh
no
this
very
minute
well
go
off
to
your
affairs
i
will
go
away
to
mine
but
it
is
quite
understood
is
it
not
what
is
quite
understood
that
no
one
is
to
enter
the
prisoners
cell
expect
with
an
order
from
the
king
an
order
which
i
will
myself
bring
quite
so
adieu
monseigneur
aramis
returned
to
his
companion
now
porthos
my
good
fellow
back
again
to
vaux
and
as
fast
as
possible
a
man
is
light
and
easy
enough
when
he
has
faithfully
served
his
king
and
in
serving
him
saved
his
country
said
porthos
the
horses
will
be
as
light
as
if
our
tissues
were
constructed
of
the
wind
of
heaven
so
let
us
be
off
and
the
carriage
lightened
of
a
prisoner
who
might
well
beas
he
in
fact
wasvery
heavy
in
the
sight
of
aramis
passed
across
the
drawbridge
of
the
bastile
which
was
raised
again
immediately
behind
it
chapter
xviii
a
night
at
the
bastile
pain
anguish
and
suffering
in
human
life
are
always
in
proportion
to
the
strength
with
which
a
man
is
endowed
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
heaven
always
apportions
to
a
mans
capability
of
endurance
the
anguish
with
which
he
afflicts
him
for
that
indeed
would
not
be
true
since
heaven
permits
the
existence
of
death
which
is
sometimes
the
only
refuge
open
to
those
who
are
too
closely
pressedtoo
bitterly
afflicted
as
far
as
the
body
is
concerned
suffering
is
in
proportion
to
the
strength
which
has
been
accorded
in
other
words
the
weak
suffer
more
where
the
trial
is
the
same
than
the
strong
and
what
are
the
elementary
principles
we
may
ask
that
compose
human
strength
is
it
notmore
than
anything
elseexercise
habit
experience
we
shall
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
demonstrate
this
for
it
is
an
axiom
in
morals
as
in
physics
when
the
young
king
stupefied
and
crushed
in
every
sense
and
feeling
found
himself
led
to
a
cell
in
the
bastile
he
fancied
death
itself
is
but
a
sleep
that
it
too
has
its
dreams
as
well
that
the
bed
had
broken
through
the
flooring
of
his
room
at
vaux
that
death
had
resulted
from
the
occurrence
and
that
still
carrying
out
his
dream
the
king
louis
xiv
now
no
longer
living
was
dreaming
one
of
those
horrors
impossible
to
realize
in
life
which
is
termed
dethronement
imprisonment
and
insult
towards
a
sovereign
who
formerly
wielded
unlimited
power
to
be
present
atan
actual
witness
tooof
this
bitterness
of
death
to
float
indecisively
in
an
incomprehensible
mystery
between
resemblance
and
reality
to
hear
everything
to
see
everything
without
interfering
in
a
single
detail
of
agonizing
suffering
wasso
the
king
thought
within
himselfa
torture
far
more
terrible
since
it
might
last
forever
is
this
what
is
termed
eternityhell
he
murmured
at
the
moment
the
door
was
closed
upon
him
which
we
remember
baisemeaux
had
shut
with
his
own
hands
he
did
not
even
look
round
him
and
in
the
room
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
wall
he
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
the
terrible
supposition
that
he
was
already
dead
as
he
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
avoid
looking
upon
something
even
worse
still
how
can
i
have
died
he
said
to
himself
sick
with
terror
the
bed
might
have
been
let
down
by
some
artificial
means
but
no
i
do
not
remember
to
have
felt
a
bruise
nor
any
shock
either
would
they
not
rather
have
poisoned
me
at
my
meals
or
with
the
fumes
of
wax
as
they
did
my
ancestress
jeanne
dalbret
suddenly
the
chill
of
the
dungeons
seemed
to
fall
like
a
wet
cloak
upon
louiss
shoulders
i
have
seen
he
said
my
father
lying
dead
upon
his
funeral
couch
in
his
regal
robes
that
pale
face
so
calm
and
worn
those
hands
once
so
skillful
lying
nerveless
by
his
side
those
limbs
stiffened
by
the
icy
grasp
of
death
nothing
there
betokened
a
sleep
that
was
disturbed
by
dreams
and
yet
how
numerous
were
the
dreams
which
heaven
might
have
sent
that
royal
corpsehim
whom
so
many
others
had
preceded
hurried
away
by
him
into
eternal
death
no
that
king
was
still
the
king
he
was
enthroned
still
upon
that
funeral
couch
as
upon
a
velvet
armchair
he
had
not
abdicated
one
title
of
his
majesty
god
who
had
not
punished
him
cannot
will
not
punish
me
who
have
done
nothing
a
strange
sound
attracted
the
young
mans
attention
he
looked
round
him
and
saw
on
the
mantelshelf
just
below
an
enormous
crucifix
coarsely
painted
in
fresco
on
the
wall
a
rat
of
enormous
size
engaged
in
nibbling
a
piece
of
dry
bread
but
fixing
all
the
time
an
intelligent
and
inquiring
look
upon
the
new
occupant
of
the
cell
the
king
could
not
resist
a
sudden
impulse
of
fear
and
disgust
he
moved
back
towards
the
door
uttering
a
loud
cry
and
as
if
he
but
needed
this
cry
which
escaped
from
his
breast
almost
unconsciously
to
recognize
himself
louis
knew
that
he
was
alive
and
in
full
possession
of
his
natural
senses
a
prisoner
he
cried

a
prisoner
he
looked
round
him
for
a
bell
to
summon
some
one
to
him
there
are
no
bells
in
the
bastile
he
said
and
it
is
in
the
bastile
i

imprisoned
in
what
way

i
have
been

yet
who

thought
the
king
relapsing
into
gloom
again
perhaps
my
brother
the
duc
dorleans
is
doing
that
which
my
uncle
wished
to
do
during
the
whole
of
his
life
against
my
father

me

are
separated
forever
and
at
this
idea
of
separation
the
poor
lover
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
sobs
and
groans
there
is
a
governor
in
this
place
the
king
continued
in
a
fury
of
passion
i
will
speak
to
him
i
will
summon
him
to

he
calledno
voice
replied
to
his
he
seized
hold
of
his
chair
and
hurled
it
against
the
massive
oaken
door
the
wood
resounded
against
the
door
and
awakened
many
a
mournful
echo
in
the
profound
depths
of
the
staircase
but
from
a
human
creature
none
this
was
a
fresh
proof
for
the
king
of
the
slight
regard
in
which
he
was
held
at
the
bastile
therefore
when
his
first
fit
of
anger
had
passed
away
having
remarked
a
barred
window
through
which
there
passed
a
stream
of
light
lozengeshaped
which
must
be
he
knew
the
bright
orb
of
approaching
day
louis
began
to
call
out
at
first
gently
enough
then
louder
and
louder
still
but
no
one
replied
twenty
other
attempts
which
he
made
one
after
another
obtained
no
other
or
better
success
his
blood
began
to
boil
within
him
and
mount
to
his
head
his
nature
was
such
that
accustomed
to
command
he
trembled
at
the
idea
of
disobedience
the
prisoner
broke
the
chair
which
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
lift
and
made
use
of
it
as
a
battering
ram
to
strike
against
the
door
he
struck
so
loudly
and
so
repeatedly
that
the
perspiration
soon
began
to
pour
down
his
face
the
sound
became
tremendous
and
continuous
certain
stifled
smothered
cries
replied
in
different
directions
this
sound
produced
a
strange
effect
upon
the
king
he
paused
to
listen
it
was
the
voice
of
the
prisoners
formerly
his
victims
now
his
companions
the
voices
ascended
like
vapors
through
the
thick
ceilings
and
the
massive
walls
and
rose
in
accusations
against
the
author
of
this
noise
as
doubtless
their
sighs
and
tears
accused
in
whispered
tones
the
author
of
their
captivity
after
having
deprived
so
many
people
of
their
liberty
the
king
came
among
them
to
rob
them
of
their
rest
this
idea
almost
drove
him
mad
it
redoubled
his
strength
or
rather
his
will
bent
upon
obtaining
some
information
or
a
conclusion
to
the
affair
with
a
portion
of
the
broken
chair
he
recommenced
the
noise
at
the
end
of
an
hour
louis
heard
something
in
the
corridor
behind
the
door
of
his
cell
and
a
violent
blow
which
was
returned
upon
the
door
itself
made
him
cease
his
own
are
you
mad
said
a
rude
brutal
voice
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
this
morning
thought
the
king
but
he
said
aloud
politely
monsieur
are
you
the
governor
of
the
bastile
my
good
fellow
your
head
is
out
of
sorts
replied
the
voice
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
make
such
a
terrible
disturbance
be
quiet
mordioux
are
you
the
governor
the
king
inquired
again
he
heard
a
door
on
the
corridor
close
the
jailer
had
just
left
not
condescending
to
reply
a
single
word
when
the
king
had
assured
himself
of
his
departure
his
fury
knew
no
longer
any
bounds
as
agile
as
a
tiger
he
leaped
from
the
table
to
the
window
and
struck
the
iron
bars
with
all
his
might
he
broke
a
pane
of
glass
the
pieces
of
which
fell
clanking
into
the
courtyard
below
he
shouted
with
increasing
hoarseness
the
governor
the
governor
this
excess
lasted
fully
an
hour
during
which
time
he
was
in
a
burning
fever
with
his
hair
in
disorder
and
matted
on
his
forehead
his
dress
torn
and
covered
with
dust
and
plaster
his
linen
in
shreds
the
king
never
rested
until
his
strength
was
utterly
exhausted
and
it
was
not
until
then
that
he
clearly
understood
the
pitiless
thickness
of
the
walls
the
impenetrable
nature
of
the
cement
invincible
to
every
influence
but
that
of
time
and
that
he
possessed
no
other
weapon
but
despair
he
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
door
and
let
the
feverish
throbbings
of
his
heart
calm
by
degrees
it
had
seemed
as
if
one
single
additional
pulsation
would
have
made
it
burst
a
moment
will
come
when
the
food
which
is
given
to
the
prisoners
will
be
brought
to
me
i
shall
then
see
some
one
i
shall
speak
to
him
and
get
an
answer
and
the
king
tried
to
remember
at
what
hour
the
first
repast
of
the
prisoners
was
served
at
the
bastile
he
was
ignorant
even
of
this
detail
the
feeling
of
remorse
at
this
remembrance
smote
him
like
the
thrust
of
a
dagger
that
he
should
have
lived
for
five
and
twenty
years
a
king
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
every
happiness
without
having
bestowed
a
moments
thought
on
the
misery
of
those
who
had
been
unjustly
deprived
of
their
liberty
the
king
blushed
for
very
shame
he
felt
that
heaven
in
permitting
this
fearful
humiliation
did
no
more
than
render
to
the
man
the
same
torture
as
had
been
inflicted
by
that
man
upon
so
many
others
nothing
could
be
more
efficacious
for
reawakening
his
mind
to
religious
influences
than
the
prostration
of
his
heart
and
mind
and
soul
beneath
the
feeling
of
such
acute
wretchedness
but
louis
dared
not
even
kneel
in
prayer
to
god
to
entreat
him
to
terminate
his
bitter
trial
heaven
is
right
he
said
heaven
acts
wisely
it
would
be
cowardly
to
pray
to
heaven
for
that
which
i
have
so
often
refused
my
own
fellowcreatures
he
had
reached
this
stage
of
his
reflections
that
is
of
his
agony
of
mind
when
a
similar
noise
was
again
heard
behind
his
door
followed
this
time
by
the
sound
of
the
key
in
the
lock
and
of
the
bolts
being
withdrawn
from
their
staples
the
king
bounded
forward
to
be
nearer
to
the
person
who
was
about
to
enter
but
suddenly
reflecting
that
it
was
a
movement
unworthy
of
a
sovereign
he
paused
assumed
a
noble
and
calm
expression
which
for
him
was
easy
enough
and
waited
with
his
back
turned
towards
the
window
in
order
to
some
extent
to
conceal
his
agitation
from
the
eyes
of
the
person
who
was
about
to
enter
it
was
only
a
jailer
with
a
basket
of
provisions
the
king
looked
at
the
man
with
restless
anxiety
and
waited
until
he
spoke
ah
said
the
latter
you
have
broken
your
chair
i
said
you
had
done
so
why
you
have
gone
quite
mad
monsieur
said
the
king
be
careful
what
you
say
it
will
be
a
very
serious
affair
for
you
the
jailer
placed
the
basket
on
the
table
and
looked
at
his
prisoner
steadily
what
do
you
say
he
said
desire
the
governor
to
come
to
me
added
the
king
in
accents
full
of
calm
and
dignity
come
my
boy
said
the
turnkey
you
have
always
been
very
quiet
and
reasonable
but
you
are
getting
vicious
it
seems
and
i
wish
you
to
know
it
in
time
you
have
broken
your
chair
and
made
a
great
disturbance
that
is
an
offense
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
one
of
the
lower
dungeons
promise
me
not
to
begin
over
again
and
i
will
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
the
governor
i
wish
to
see
the
governor
replied
the
king
still
governing
his
passions
he
will
send
you
off
to
one
of
the
dungeons
i
tell
you
so
take
care
i
insist
upon
it
do
you
hear
ah
ah
your
eyes
are
becoming
wild
again
very
good
i
shall
take
away
your
knife
and
the
jailer
did
what
he
said
quitted
the
prisoner
and
closed
the
door
leaving
the
king
more
astounded
more
wretched
more
isolated
than
ever
it
was
useless
though
he
tried
it
to
make
the
same
noise
again
on
his
door
and
equally
useless
that
he
threw
the
plates
and
dishes
out
of
the
window
not
a
single
sound
was
heard
in
recognition
two
hours
afterwards
he
could
not
be
recognized
as
a
king
a
gentleman
a
man
a
human
being
he
might
rather
be
called
a
madman
tearing
the
door
with
his
nails
trying
to
tear
up
the
flooring
of
his
cell
and
uttering
such
wild
and
fearful
cries
that
the
old
bastile
seemed
to
tremble
to
its
very
foundations
for
having
revolted
against
its
master
as
for
the
governor
the
jailer
did
not
even
think
of
disturbing
him
the
turnkeys
and
the
sentinels
had
reported
the
occurrence
to
him
but
what
was
the
good
of
it
were
not
these
madmen
common
enough
in
such
a
prison
and
were
not
the
walls
still
stronger
m
de
baisemeaux
thoroughly
impressed
with
what
aramis
had
told
him
and
in
perfect
conformity
with
the
kings
order
hoped
only
that
one
thing
might
happen
namely
that
the
madman
marchiali
might
be
mad
enough
to
hang
himself
to
the
canopy
of
his
bed
or
to
one
of
the
bars
of
the
window
in
fact
the
prisoner
was
anything
but
a
profitable
investment
for
m
baisemeaux
and
became
more
annoying
than
agreeable
to
him
these
complications
of
seldon
and
marchialithe
complications
first
of
setting
at
liberty
and
then
imprisoning
again
the
complications
arising
from
the
strong
likeness
in
questionhad
at
last
found
a
very
proper
denouement
baisemeaux
even
thought
he
had
remarked
that
dherblay
himself
was
not
altogether
dissatisfied
with
the
result
and
then
really
said
baisemeaux
to
his
next
in
command
an
ordinary
prisoner
is
already
unhappy
enough
in
being
a
prisoner
he
suffers
quite
enough
indeed
to
induce
one
to
hope
charitably
enough
that
his
death
may
not
be
far
distant
with
still
greater
reason
accordingly
when
the
prisoner
has
gone
mad
and
might
bite
and
make
a
terrible
disturbance
in
the
bastile
why
in
such
a
case
it
is
not
simply
an
act
of
mere
charity
to
wish
him
dead
it
would
be
almost
a
good
and
even
commendable
action
quietly
to
have
him
put
out
of
his
misery
and
the
goodnatured
governor
thereupon
sat
down
to
his
late
breakfast
chapter
xix
the
shadow
of
m
fouquet
dartagnan
still
confused
and
oppressed
by
the
conversation
he
had
just
had
with
the
king
could
not
resist
asking
himself
if
he
were
really
in
possession
of
his
senses
if
he
were
really
and
truly
at
vaux
if
he
dartagnan
were
really
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
and
m
fouquet
the
owner
of
the
chateau
in
which
louis
xiv
was
at
that
moment
partaking
of
his
hospitality
these
reflections
were
not
those
of
a
drunken
man
although
everything
was
in
prodigal
profusion
at
vaux
and
the
surintendants
wines
had
met
with
a
distinguished
reception
at
the
fete
the
gascon
however
was
a
man
of
calm
selfpossession
and
no
sooner
did
he
touch
his
bright
steel
blade
than
he
knew
how
to
adopt
morally
the
cold
keen
weapon
as
his
guide
of
action
well
he
said
as
he
quitted
the
royal
apartment
i
seem
now
to
be
mixed
up
historically
with
the
destinies
of
the
king
and
of
the
minister
it
will
be
written
that
m
dartagnan
a
younger
son
of
a
gascon
family
placed
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
m
nicolas
fouquet
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
of
france
my
descendants
if
i
have
any
will
flatter
themselves
with
the
distinction
which
this
arrest
will
confer
just
as
the
members
of
the
de
luynes
family
have
done
with
regard
to
the
estates
of
the
poor
marechal
dancre
but
the
thing
is
how
best
to
execute
the
kings
directions
in
a
proper
manner
any
man
would
know
how
to
say
to
m
fouquet
your
sword
monsieur
but
it
is
not
every
one
who
would
be
able
to
take
care
of
m
fouquet
without
others
knowing
anything
about
it
how
am
i
to
manage
then
so
that
m
le
surintendant
pass
from
the
height
of
favor
to
the
direst
disgrace
that
vaux
be
turned
into
a
dungeon
for
him
that
after
having
been
steeped
to
his
lips
as
it
were
in
all
the
perfumes
and
incense
of
ahasuerus
he
is
transferred
to
the
gallows
of
haman
in
other
words
of
enguerrand
de
marigny
and
at
this
reflection
dartagnans
brow
became
clouded
with
perplexity
the
musketeer
had
certain
scruples
on
the
matter
it
must
be
admitted
to
deliver
up
to
death
for
not
a
doubt
existed
that
louis
hated
fouquet
mortally
the
man
who
had
just
shown
himself
so
delightful
and
charming
a
host
in
every
way
was
a
real
insult
to
ones
conscience
it
almost
seems
said
dartagnan
to
himself
that
if
i
am
not
a
poor
mean
miserable
fellow
i
should
let
m
fouquet
know
the
opinion
the
king
has
about
him
yet
if
i
betray
my
masters
secret
i
shall
be
a
falsehearted
treacherous
knave
a
traitor
too
a
crime
provided
for
and
punishable
by
military
lawsso
much
so
indeed
that
twenty
times
in
former
days
when
wars
were
rife
i
have
seen
many
a
miserable
fellow
strung
up
to
a
tree
for
doing
in
but
a
small
degree
what
my
scruples
counsel
me
to
undertake
upon
a
great
scale
now
no
i
think
that
a
man
of
true
readiness
of
wit
ought
to
get
out
of
this
difficulty
with
more
skill
than
that
and
now
let
us
admit
that
i
do
possess
a
little
readiness
of
invention
it
is
not
at
all
certain
though
for
after
having
for
forty
years
absorbed
so
large
a
quantity
i
shall
be
lucky
if
there
were
to
be
a
pistolesworth
left
dartagnan
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
tore
at
his
mustache
in
sheer
vexation
and
added
what
can
be
the
reason
of
m
fouquets
disgrace
there
seem
to
be
three
good
ones
the
first
because
m
colbert
doesnt
like
him
the
second
because
he
wished
to
fall
in
love
with
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
lastly
because
the
king
likes
m
colbert
and
loves
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
oh
he
is
lost
but
shall
i
put
my
foot
on
his
neck
i
of
all
men
when
he
is
falling
a
prey
to
the
intrigues
of
a
pack
of
women
and
clerks
for
shame
if
he
be
dangerous
i
will
lay
him
low
enough
if
however
he
be
only
persecuted
i
will
look
on
i
have
come
to
such
a
decisive
determination
that
neither
king
nor
living
man
shall
change
my
mind
if
athos
were
here
he
would
do
as
i
have
done
therefore
instead
of
going
in
cold
blood
up
to
m
fouquet
and
arresting
him
offhand
and
shutting
him
up
altogether
i
will
try
and
conduct
myself
like
a
man
who
understands
what
good
manners
are
people
will
talk
about
it
of
course
but
they
shall
talk
well
of
it
i
am
determined
and
dartagnan
drawing
by
a
gesture
peculiar
to
himself
his
shoulderbelt
over
his
shoulder
went
straight
off
to
m
fouquet
who
after
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
guests
was
preparing
to
retire
for
the
night
and
to
sleep
tranquilly
after
the
triumphs
of
the
day
the
air
was
still
perfumed
or
infected
whichever
way
it
may
be
considered
with
the
odors
of
the
torches
and
the
fireworks
the
waxlights
were
dying
away
in
their
sockets
the
flowers
fell
unfastened
from
the
garlands
the
groups
of
dancers
and
courtiers
were
separating
in
the
salons
surrounded
by
his
friends
who
complimented
him
and
received
his
flattering
remarks
in
return
the
surintendant
halfclosed
his
wearied
eyes
he
longed
for
rest
and
quiet
he
sank
upon
the
bed
of
laurels
which
had
been
heaped
up
for
him
for
so
many
days
past
it
might
almost
have
been
said
that
he
seemed
bowed
beneath
the
weight
of
the
new
debts
which
he
had
incurred
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
greatest
possible
honor
to
this
fete
fouquet
had
just
retired
to
his
room
still
smiling
but
more
than
halfasleep
he
could
listen
to
nothing
more
he
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
open
his
bed
seemed
to
possess
a
fascinating
and
irresistible
attraction
for
him
the
god
morpheus
the
presiding
deity
of
the
dome
painted
by
lebrun
had
extended
his
influence
over
the
adjoining
rooms
and
showered
down
his
most
sleepinducing
poppies
upon
the
master
of
the
house
fouquet
almost
entirely
alone
was
being
assisted
by
his
valet
de
chambre
to
undress
when
m
dartagnan
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
room
dartagnan
had
never
been
able
to
succeed
in
making
himself
common
at
the
court
and
notwithstanding
he
was
seen
everywhere
and
on
all
occasions
he
never
failed
to
produce
an
effect
wherever
and
whenever
he
made
his
appearance
such
is
the
happy
privilege
of
certain
natures
which
in
that
respect
resemble
either
thunder
or
lightning
every
one
recognizes
them
but
their
appearance
never
fails
to
arouse
surprise
and
astonishment
and
whenever
they
occur
the
impression
is
always
left
that
the
last
was
the
most
conspicuous
or
most
important
what
m
dartagnan
said
fouquet
who
had
already
taken
his
right
arm
out
of
the
sleeve
of
his
doublet
at
your
service
replied
the
musketeer
come
in
my
dear
m
dartagnan
thank
you
have
you
come
to
criticise
the
fete
you
are
ingenious
enough
in
your
criticisms
i
know
by
no
means
are
not
your
men
looked
after
properly
in
every
way
you
are
not
comfortably
lodged
perhaps
nothing
could
be
better
in
that
case
i
have
to
thank
you
for
being
so
amiably
disposed
and
i
must
not
fail
to
express
my
obligations
to
you
for
all
your
flattering
kindness
these
words
were
as
much
as
to
say
my
dear
dartagnan
pray
go
to
bed
since
you
have
a
bed
to
lie
down
on
and
let
me
do
the
same
dartagnan
did
not
seem
to
understand
it
are
you
going
to
bed
already
he
said
to
the
superintendent
yes
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
nothing
monsieur
nothing
at
all
you
sleep
in
this
room
then
yes
as
you
see
you
have
given
a
most
charming
fete
to
the
king
do
you
think
so
oh
beautiful
is
the
king
pleased
enchanted
did
he
desire
you
to
say
as
much
to
me
he
would
not
choose
so
unworthy
a
messenger
monseigneur
you
do
not
do
yourself
justice
monsieur
dartagnan
is
that
your
bed
there
yes
but
why
do
you
ask
are
you
not
satisfied
with
your
own
my
i
speak
frankly
to
you
most
assuredly
well
then
i
am
not
fouquet
started
and
then
replied
will
you
take
my
room
monsieur
dartagnan
what
deprive
you
of
it
monseigneur
never
what
am
i
to
do
then
allow
me
to
share
yours
with
you
fouquet
looked
at
the
musketeer
fixedly
ah
ah
he
said
you
have
just
left
the
king
i
have
monseigneur
and
the
king
wishes
you
to
pass
the
night
in
my
room
monseigneur
very
well
monsieur
dartagnan
very
well
you
are
the
master
here
i
assure
you
monseigneur
that
i
do
not
wish
to
abuse
fouquet
turned
to
his
valet
and
said
leave
us
when
the
man
had
left
he
said
to
dartagnan
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
i
a
man
of
your
superior
intelligence
cannot
have
come
to
talk
with
a
man
like
myself
at
such
an
hour
as
the
present
without
grave
motives
do
not
interrogate
me
on
the
contrary
what
do
you
want
with
me
nothing
more
than
the
pleasure
of
your
society
come
into
the
garden
then
said
the
superintendent
suddenly
or
into
the
park
no
replied
the
musketeer
hastily
no
why
the
fresh
air
come
admit
at
once
that
you
arrest
me
said
the
superintendent
to
the
captain
never
said
the
latter
you
intend
to
look
after
me
then
yes
monseigneur
i
do
upon
my
honor
upon
your
honorah
that
is
quite
another
thing
so
i
am
to
be
arrested
in
my
own
house
do
not
say
such
a
thing
on
the
contrary
i
will
proclaim
it
aloud
if
you
do
so
i
shall
be
compelled
to
request
you
to
be
silent
very
good
violence
towards
me
and
in
my
own
house
too
we
do
not
seem
to
understand
one
another
at
all
stay
a
moment
there
is
a
chessboard
there
we
will
have
a
game
if
you
have
no
objections
monsieur
dartagnan
i
am
in
disgrace
then
not
at
all
but
i
am
prohibited
i
suppose
from
withdrawing
from
your
sight
i
do
not
understand
a
word
you
are
saying
monseigneur
and
if
you
wish
me
to
withdraw
tell
me
so
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
your
mode
of
action
is
enough
to
drive
me
mad
i
was
almost
sinking
for
want
of
sleep
but
you
have
completely
awakened
me
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
i
am
sure
and
if
you
wish
to
reconcile
me
with
myself
why
go
to
sleep
in
your
bed
in
my
presence
and
i
shall
be
delighted
i
am
under
surveillance
i
see
i
will
leave
the
room
if
you
say
any
such
thing
you
are
beyond
my
comprehension
good
night
monseigneur
said
dartagnan
as
he
pretended
to
withdraw
fouquet
ran
after
him
i
will
not
lie
down
he
said
seriously
and
since
you
refuse
to
treat
me
as
a
man
and
since
you
finesse
with
me
i
will
try
and
set
you
at
bay
as
a
hunter
does
a
wild
boar
bah
cried
dartagnan
pretending
to
smile
i
shall
order
my
horses
and
set
off
for
paris
said
fouquet
sounding
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
if
that
be
the
case
monseigneur
it
is
very
difficult
you
will
arrest
me
then
no
but
i
shall
go
along
with
you
that
is
quite
sufficient
monsieur
dartagnan
returned
fouquet
coldly
it
was
not
for
nothing
you
acquired
your
reputation
as
a
man
of
intelligence
and
resource
but
with
me
all
this
is
quite
superfluous
let
us
come
to
the
point
do
me
a
service
why
do
you
arrest
me
what
have
i
done
oh
i
know
nothing
about
what
you
may
have
done
but
i
do
not
arrest
youthis
evening
at
least
this
evening
said
fouquet
turning
pale
but
tomorrow
it
is
not
tomorrow
just
yet
monseigneur
who
can
ever
answer
for
the
morrow
quick
quick
captain
let
me
speak
to
m
dherblay
alas
that
is
quite
impossible
monseigneur
i
have
strict
orders
to
see
that
you
hold
no
communication
with
any
one
with
m
dherblay
captainwith
your
friend
monseigneur
is
m
dherblay
the
only
person
with
whom
you
ought
to
be
prevented
holding
any
communication
fouquet
colored
and
then
assuming
an
air
of
resignation
he
said
you
are
right
monsieur
you
have
taught
me
a
lesson
i
ought
not
to
have
evoked
a
fallen
man
cannot
assert
his
right
to
anything
even
from
those
whose
fortunes
he
may
have
made
for
a
still
stronger
reason
he
cannot
claim
anything
from
those
to
whom
he
may
never
have
had
the
happiness
of
doing
a
service
monseigneur
it
is
perfectly
true
monsieur
dartagnan
you
have
always
acted
in
the
most
admirable
manner
towards
mein
such
a
manner
indeed
as
most
becomes
the
man
who
is
destined
to
arrest
me
you
at
least
have
never
asked
me
anything
monsieur
replied
the
gascon
touched
by
his
eloquent
and
noble
tone
of
grief
will
youi
ask
it
as
a
favorpledge
me
your
word
as
a
man
of
honor
that
you
will
not
leave
this
room
what
is
the
use
of
it
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
since
you
keep
watch
and
ward
over
me
do
you
suppose
i
should
contend
against
the
most
valiant
sword
in
the
kingdom
it
is
not
that
at
all
monseigneur
but
that
i
am
going
to
look
for
m
dherblay
and
consequently
to
leave
you
alone
fouquet
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
and
surprise
to
look
for
m
dherblay
to
leave
me
alone
he
exclaimed
clasping
his
hands
together
which
is
m
dherblays
room
the
blue
room
is
it
not
yes
my
friend
yes
your
friend
thank
you
for
that
word
monseigneur
you
confer
it
upon
me
today
at
least
if
you
have
never
done
so
before
ah
you
have
saved
me
it
will
take
a
good
ten
minutes
to
go
from
hence
to
the
blue
room
and
to
return
said
dartagnan
nearly
so
and
then
to
wake
aramis
who
sleeps
very
soundly
when
he
is
asleep
i
put
that
down
at
another
five
minutes
making
a
total
of
fifteen
minutes
absence
and
now
monseigneur
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
not
in
any
way
attempt
to
make
your
escape
and
that
when
i
return
i
shall
find
you
here
again
i
give
it
monsieur
replied
fouquet
with
an
expression
of
the
warmest
and
deepest
gratitude
dartagnan
disappeared
fouquet
looked
at
him
as
he
quitted
the
room
waited
with
a
feverish
impatience
until
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
and
as
soon
as
it
was
shut
flew
to
his
keys
opened
two
or
three
secret
doors
concealed
in
various
articles
of
furniture
in
the
room
looked
vainly
for
certain
papers
which
doubtless
he
had
left
at
saintmande
and
which
he
seemed
to
regret
not
having
found
in
them
then
hurriedly
seizing
hold
of
letters
contracts
papers
writings
he
heaped
them
up
into
a
pile
which
he
burnt
in
the
extremest
haste
upon
the
marble
hearth
of
the
fireplace
not
even
taking
time
to
draw
from
the
interior
of
it
the
vases
and
pots
of
flowers
with
which
it
was
filled
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
like
a
man
who
has
just
escaped
an
imminent
danger
and
whose
strength
abandons
him
as
soon
as
the
danger
is
past
he
sank
down
completely
overcome
on
a
couch
when
dartagnan
returned
he
found
fouquet
in
the
same
position
the
worthy
musketeer
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
fouquet
having
given
his
word
would
not
even
think
of
failing
to
keep
it
but
he
had
thought
it
most
likely
that
fouquet
would
turn
his
dartagnans
absence
to
the
best
advantage
in
getting
rid
of
all
the
papers
memorandums
and
contracts
which
might
possibly
render
his
position
which
was
even
now
serious
enough
more
dangerous
than
ever
and
so
lifting
up
his
head
like
a
dog
who
has
regained
the
scent
he
perceived
an
odor
resembling
smoke
he
had
relied
on
finding
in
the
atmosphere
and
having
found
it
made
a
movement
of
his
head
in
token
of
satisfaction
as
dartagnan
entered
fouquet
on
his
side
raised
his
head
and
not
one
of
dartagnans
movements
escaped
him
and
then
the
looks
of
the
two
men
met
and
they
both
saw
that
they
had
understood
each
other
without
exchanging
a
syllable
well
asked
fouquet
the
first
to
speak
and
m
dherblay
upon
my
word
monseigneur
replied
dartagnan
m
dherblay
must
be
desperately
fond
of
walking
out
at
night
and
composing
verses
by
moonlight
in
the
park
of
vaux
with
some
of
your
poets
in
all
probability
for
he
is
not
in
his
own
room
what
not
in
his
own
room
cried
fouquet
whose
last
hope
thus
escaped
him
for
unless
he
could
ascertain
in
what
way
the
bishop
of
vannes
could
assist
him
he
perfectly
well
knew
that
he
could
expect
assistance
from
no
other
quarter
or
indeed
continued
dartagnan
if
he
is
in
his
own
room
he
has
very
good
reasons
for
not
answering
but
surely
you
did
not
call
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
have
heard
you
you
can
hardly
suppose
monseigneur
that
having
already
exceeded
my
orders
which
forbade
me
leaving
you
a
single
momentyou
can
hardly
suppose
i
say
that
i
should
have
been
mad
enough
to
rouse
the
whole
house
and
allow
myself
to
be
seen
in
the
corridor
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
in
order
that
m
colbert
might
state
with
positive
certainty
that
i
gave
you
time
to
burn
your
papers
my
papers
of
course
at
least
that
is
what
i
should
have
done
in
your
place
when
any
one
opens
a
door
for
me
i
always
avail
myself
of
it
yes
yes
and
i
thank
you
for
i
have
availed
myself
of
it
and
you
have
done
perfectly
right
every
man
has
his
own
peculiar
secrets
with
which
others
have
nothing
to
do
but
let
us
return
to
aramis
monseigneur
well
then
i
tell
you
you
could
not
have
called
loud
enough
or
aramis
would
have
heard
you
however
softly
any
one
may
call
aramis
monseigneur
aramis
always
hears
when
he
has
an
interest
in
hearing
i
repeat
what
i
said
beforearamis
was
not
in
his
own
room
or
aramis
had
certain
reasons
for
not
recognizing
my
voice
of
which
i
am
ignorant
and
of
which
you
may
be
even
ignorant
yourself
notwithstanding
your
liegeman
is
his
greatness
the
lord
bishop
of
vannes
fouquet
drew
a
deep
sigh
rose
from
his
seat
took
three
or
four
turns
in
his
room
and
finished
by
seating
himself
with
an
expression
of
extreme
dejection
upon
his
magnificent
bed
with
velvet
hangings
and
costliest
lace
dartagnan
looked
at
fouquet
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
and
sincerest
pity
i
have
seen
a
good
many
men
arrested
in
my
life
said
the
musketeer
sadly
i
have
seen
both
m
de
cinqmars
and
m
de
chalais
arrested
though
i
was
very
young
then
i
have
seen
m
de
conde
arrested
with
the
princes
i
have
seen
m
de
retz
arrested
i
have
seen
m
broussel
arrested
stay
a
moment
monseigneur
it
is
disagreeable
to
have
to
say
but
the
very
one
of
all
those
whom
you
most
resemble
at
this
moment
was
that
poor
fellow
broussel
you
were
very
near
doing
as
he
did
putting
your
dinner
napkin
in
your
portfolio
and
wiping
your
mouth
with
your
papers
mordioux
monseigneur
fouquet
a
man
like
you
ought
not
to
be
dejected
in
this
manner
suppose
your
friends
saw
you
monsieur
dartagnan
returned
the
surintendant
with
a
smile
full
of
gentleness
you
do
not
understand
me
it
is
precisely
because
my
friends
are
not
looking
on
that
i
am
as
you
see
me
now
i
do
not
live
exist
even
isolated
from
others
i
am
nothing
when
left
to
myself
understand
that
throughout
my
whole
life
i
have
passed
every
moment
of
my
time
in
making
friends
whom
i
hoped
to
render
my
stay
and
support
in
times
of
prosperity
all
these
cheerful
happy
voicesrendered
so
through
and
by
my
meansformed
in
my
honor
a
concert
of
praise
and
kindly
actions
in
the
least
disfavor
these
humbler
voices
accompanied
in
harmonious
accents
the
murmur
of
my
own
heart
isolation
i
have
never
yet
known
poverty
a
phantom
i
have
sometimes
beheld
clad
in
rags
awaiting
me
at
the
end
of
my
journey
through
lifepoverty
has
been
the
specter
with
which
many
of
my
own
friends
have
trifled
for
years
past
which
they
poetize
and
caress
and
which
has
attracted
me
towards
them
poverty
i
accept
it
acknowledge
it
receive
it
as
a
disinherited
sister
for
poverty
is
neither
solitude
nor
exile
nor
imprisonment
is
it
likely
i
shall
ever
be
poor
with
such
friends
as
pelisson
as
la
fontaine
as
moliere
with
such
a
mistress
asoh
if
you
knew
how
utterly
lonely
and
desolate
i
feel
at
this
moment
and
how
you
who
separate
me
from
all
i
love
seem
to
resemble
the
image
of
solitude
of
annihilationdeath
itself
but
i
have
already
told
you
monsieur
fouquet
replied
dartagnan
moved
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
that
you
are
woefully
exaggerating
the
king
likes
you
no
no
said
fouquet
shaking
his
head
m
colbert
hates
you
m
colbert
what
does
that
matter
to
me
he
will
ruin
you
ah
i
defy
him
to
do
that
for
i
am
ruined
already
at
this
singular
confession
of
the
superintendent
dartagnan
cast
his
glance
all
round
the
room
and
although
he
did
not
open
his
lips
fouquet
understood
him
so
thoroughly
that
he
added
what
can
be
done
with
such
wealth
of
substance
as
surrounds
us
when
a
man
can
no
longer
cultivate
his
taste
for
the
magnificent
do
you
know
what
good
the
greater
part
of
the
wealth
and
the
possessions
which
we
rich
enjoy
confer
upon
us
merely
to
disgust
us
by
their
very
splendor
even
with
everything
which
does
not
equal
it
vaux
you
will
say
and
the
wonders
of
vaux
what
of
it
what
boot
these
wonders
if
i
am
ruined
how
shall
i
fill
with
water
the
urns
which
my
naiads
bear
in
their
arms
or
force
the
air
into
the
lungs
of
my
tritons
to
be
rich
enough
monsieur
dartagnan
a
man
must
be
too
rich
dartagnan
shook
his
head
oh
i
know
very
well
what
you
think
replied
fouquet
quickly
if
vaux
were
yours
you
would
sell
it
and
would
purchase
an
estate
in
the
country
an
estate
which
should
have
woods
orchards
and
land
attached
so
that
the
estate
should
be
made
to
support
its
master
with
forty
millions
you
might
ten
millions
interrupted
dartagnan
not
a
million
my
dear
captain
no
one
in
france
is
rich
enough
to
give
two
millions
for
vaux
and
to
continue
to
maintain
it
as
i
have
done
no
one
could
do
it
no
one
would
know
how
well
said
dartagnan
in
any
case
a
million
is
not
abject
misery
it
is
not
far
from
it
my
dear
monsieur
but
you
do
not
understand
me
no
i
will
not
sell
my
residence
at
vaux
i
will
give
it
to
you
if
you
like
and
fouquet
accompanied
these
words
with
a
movement
of
the
shoulders
to
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
justice
give
it
to
the
king
you
will
make
a
better
bargain
the
king
does
not
require
me
to
give
it
to
him
said
fouquet
he
will
take
it
away
from
me
with
the
most
absolute
ease
and
grace
if
it
pleases
him
to
do
so
and
that
is
the
very
reason
i
should
prefer
to
see
it
perish
do
you
know
monsieur
dartagnan
that
if
the
king
did
not
happen
to
be
under
my
roof
i
would
take
this
candle
go
straight
to
the
dome
and
set
fire
to
a
couple
of
huge
chests
of
fusees
and
fireworks
which
are
in
reserve
there
and
would
reduce
my
palace
to
ashes
bah
said
the
musketeer
negligently
at
all
events
you
would
not
be
able
to
burn
the
gardens
and
that
is
the
finest
feature
of
the
place
and
yet
resumed
fouquet
thoughtfully
what
was
i
saying
great
heavens
burn
vaux
destroy
my
palace
but
vaux
is
not
mine
these
wonderful
creations
are
it
is
true
the
property
as
far
as
sense
of
enjoyment
goes
of
the
man
who
has
paid
for
them
but
as
far
as
duration
is
concerned
they
belong
to
those
who
created
them
vaux
belongs
to
lebrun
to
lenotre
to
pelisson
to
levau
to
la
fontaine
to
moliere
vaux
belongs
to
posterity
in
fact
you
see
monsieur
dartagnan
that
my
very
house
has
ceased
to
be
my
own
that
is
all
well
and
good
said
dartagnan
the
idea
is
agreeable
enough
and
i
recognize
m
fouquet
himself
in
it
that
idea
indeed
makes
me
forget
that
poor
fellow
broussel
altogether
and
i
now
fail
to
recognize
in
you
the
whining
complaints
of
that
old
frondeur
if
you
are
ruined
monsieur
look
at
the
affair
manfully
for
you
too
mordioux
belong
to
posterity
and
have
no
right
to
lessen
yourself
in
any
way
stay
a
moment
look
at
me
i
who
seem
to
exercise
in
some
degree
a
kind
of
superiority
over
you
because
i
am
arresting
you
fate
which
distributes
their
different
parts
to
the
comedians
of
this
world
accorded
me
a
less
agreeable
and
less
advantageous
part
to
fill
than
yours
has
been
i
am
one
of
those
who
think
that
the
parts
which
kings
and
powerful
nobles
are
called
upon
to
act
are
infinitely
of
more
worth
than
the
parts
of
beggars
or
lackeys
it
is
far
better
on
the
stageon
the
stage
i
mean
of
another
theater
than
the
theater
of
this
worldit
is
far
better
to
wear
a
fine
coat
and
to
talk
a
fine
language
than
to
walk
the
boards
shod
with
a
pair
of
old
shoes
or
to
get
ones
backbone
gently
polished
by
a
hearty
dressing
with
a
stick
in
one
word
you
have
been
a
prodigal
with
money
you
have
ordered
and
been
obeyedhave
been
steeped
to
the
lips
in
enjoyment
while
i
have
dragged
my
tether
after
me
have
been
commanded
and
have
obeyed
and
have
drudged
my
life
away
well
although
i
may
seem
of
such
trifling
importance
beside
you
monseigneur
i
do
declare
to
you
that
the
recollection
of
what
i
have
done
serves
me
as
a
spur
and
prevents
me
from
bowing
my
old
head
too
soon
i
shall
remain
unto
the
very
end
a
trooper
and
when
my
turn
comes
i
shall
fall
perfectly
straight
all
in
a
heap
still
alive
after
having
selected
my
place
beforehand
do
as
i
do
monsieur
fouquet
you
will
not
find
yourself
the
worse
for
it
a
fall
happens
only
once
in
a
lifetime
to
men
like
yourself
and
the
chief
thing
is
to
take
it
gracefully
when
the
chance
presents
itself
there
is
a
latin
proverbthe
words
have
escaped
me
but
i
remember
the
sense
of
it
very
well
for
i
have
thought
over
it
more
than
oncewhich
says
the
end
crowns
the
work
fouquet
rose
from
his
seat
passed
his
arm
round
dartagnans
neck
and
clasped
him
in
a
close
embrace
whilst
with
the
other
hand
he
pressed
his
hand
an
excellent
homily
he
said
after
a
moments
pause
a
soldiers
monseigneur
you
have
a
regard
for
me
in
telling
me
all
that
perhaps
fouquet
resumed
his
pensive
attitude
once
more
and
then
a
moment
after
he
said
where
can
m
dherblay
be
i
dare
not
ask
you
to
send
for
him
you
would
not
ask
me
because
i
would
not
do
it
monsieur
fouquet
people
would
learn
it
and
aramis
who
is
not
mixed
up
with
the
affair
might
possibly
be
compromised
and
included
in
your
disgrace
i
will
wait
here
till
daylight
said
fouquet
yes
that
is
best
what
shall
we
do
when
daylight
comes
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
monseigneur
monsieur
dartagnan
will
you
do
me
a
favor
most
willingly
you
guard
me
i
remain
you
are
acting
in
the
full
discharge
of
your
duty
i
suppose
certainly
very
good
then
remain
as
close
to
me
as
my
shadow
if
you
like
and
i
infinitely
prefer
such
a
shadow
to
any
one
else
dartagnan
bowed
to
the
compliment
but
forget
that
you
are
monsieur
dartagnan
captain
of
the
musketeers
forget
that
i
am
monsieur
fouquet
surintendant
of
the
finances
and
let
us
talk
about
my
affairs
that
is
rather
a
delicate
subject
indeed
yes
but
for
your
sake
monsieur
fouquet
i
will
do
what
may
almost
be
regarded
as
an
impossibility
thank
you
what
did
the
king
say
to
you
nothing
ah
is
that
the
way
you
talk
the
deuce
what
do
you
think
of
my
situation
i
do
not
know
however
unless
you
have
some
ill
feeling
against
me
your
position
is
a
difficult
one
in
what
respect
because
you
are
under
your
own
roof
however
difficult
it
may
be
i
understand
it
very
well
do
you
suppose
that
with
any
one
else
but
yourself
i
should
have
shown
so
much
frankness
what
so
much
frankness
do
you
say
you
who
refuse
to
tell
me
the
slightest
thing
at
all
events
then
so
much
ceremony
and
consideration
ah
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
that
respect
one
moment
monseigneur
let
me
tell
you
how
i
should
have
behaved
towards
any
one
but
yourself
it
might
be
that
i
happened
to
arrive
at
your
door
just
as
your
guests
or
your
friends
had
left
youor
if
they
had
not
gone
yet
i
should
wait
until
they
were
leaving
and
should
then
catch
them
one
after
the
other
like
rabbits
i
should
lock
them
up
quietly
enough
i
should
steal
softly
along
the
carpet
of
your
corridor
and
with
one
hand
upon
you
before
you
suspected
the
slightest
thing
amiss
i
should
keep
you
safely
until
my
masters
breakfast
in
the
morning
in
this
way
i
should
just
the
same
have
avoided
all
publicity
all
disturbance
all
opposition
but
there
would
also
have
been
no
warning
for
m
fouquet
no
consideration
for
his
feelings
none
of
those
delicate
concessions
which
are
shown
by
persons
who
are
essentially
courteous
in
their
natures
whenever
the
decisive
moment
may
arrive
are
you
satisfied
with
the
plan
it
makes
me
shudder
i
thought
you
would
not
like
it
it
would
have
been
very
disagreeable
to
have
made
my
appearance
tomorrow
without
any
preparation
and
to
have
asked
you
to
deliver
up
your
sword
oh
monsieur
i
should
have
died
of
shame
and
anger
your
gratitude
is
too
eloquently
expressed
i
have
not
done
enough
to
deserve
it
i
assure
you
most
certainly
monsieur
you
will
never
get
me
to
believe
that
well
then
monseigneur
if
you
are
satisfied
with
what
i
have
done
and
have
somewhat
recovered
from
the
shock
which
i
prepared
you
for
as
much
as
i
possibly
could
let
us
allow
the
few
hours
that
remain
to
pass
away
undisturbed
you
are
harassed
and
should
arrange
your
thoughts
i
beg
you
therefore
go
to
sleep
or
pretend
to
go
to
sleep
either
on
your
bed
or
in
your
bed
i
will
sleep
in
this
armchair
and
when
i
fall
asleep
my
rest
is
so
sound
that
a
cannon
would
not
wake
me
fouquet
smiled
i
expect
however
continued
the
musketeer
the
case
of
a
door
being
opened
whether
a
secret
door
or
any
other
or
the
case
of
any
one
going
out
of
or
coming
into
the
roomfor
anything
like
that
my
ear
is
as
quick
and
sensitive
as
the
ear
of
a
mouse
creaking
noises
make
me
start
it
arises
i
suppose
from
a
natural
antipathy
to
anything
of
the
kind
move
about
as
much
as
you
like
walk
up
and
down
in
any
part
of
the
room
write
efface
destroy
burnnothing
like
that
will
prevent
me
from
going
to
sleep
or
even
prevent
me
from
snoring
but
do
not
touch
either
the
key
or
the
handle
of
the
door
for
i
should
start
up
in
a
moment
and
that
would
shake
my
nerves
and
make
me
ill
monsieur
dartagnan
said
fouquet
you
are
certainly
the
most
witty
and
the
most
courteous
man
i
ever
met
with
and
you
will
leave
me
only
one
regret
that
of
having
made
your
acquaintance
so
late
dartagnan
drew
a
deep
sigh
which
seemed
to
say
alas
you
have
perhaps
made
it
too
soon
he
then
settled
himself
in
his
armchair
while
fouquet
half
lying
on
his
bed
and
leaning
on
his
arm
was
meditating
on
his
misadventures
in
this
way
both
of
them
leaving
the
candles
burning
awaited
the
first
dawn
of
the
day
and
when
fouquet
happened
to
sigh
too
loudly
dartagnan
only
snored
the
louder
not
a
single
visit
not
even
from
aramis
disturbed
their
quietude
not
a
sound
even
was
heard
throughout
the
whole
vast
palace
outside
however
the
guards
of
honor
on
duty
and
the
patrol
of
musketeers
paced
up
and
down
and
the
sound
of
their
feet
could
be
heard
on
the
gravel
walks
it
seemed
to
act
as
an
additional
soporific
for
the
sleepers
while
the
murmuring
of
the
wind
through
the
trees
and
the
unceasing
music
of
the
fountains
whose
waters
tumbled
in
the
basin
still
went
on
uninterruptedly
without
being
disturbed
at
the
slight
noises
and
items
of
little
moment
that
constitute
the
life
and
death
of
human
nature
chapter
xx
the
morning
in
vivid
contrast
to
the
sad
and
terrible
destiny
of
the
king
imprisoned
in
the
bastile
and
tearing
in
sheer
despair
the
bolts
and
bars
of
his
dungeon
the
rhetoric
of
the
chroniclers
of
old
would
not
fail
to
present
as
a
complete
antithesis
the
picture
of
philippe
lying
asleep
beneath
the
royal
canopy
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
such
rhetoric
is
always
bad
and
always
scatters
in
places
where
they
have
no
right
to
grow
the
flowers
with
which
it
embellishes
and
enlivens
history
but
we
shall
on
the
present
occasion
carefully
avoid
polishing
the
antithesis
in
question
but
shall
proceed
to
draw
another
picture
as
minutely
as
possible
to
serve
as
foil
and
counterfoil
to
the
one
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
young
prince
alighted
from
aramiss
room
in
the
same
way
the
king
had
descended
from
the
apartment
dedicated
to
morpheus
the
dome
gradually
and
slowly
sank
down
under
aramiss
pressure
and
philippe
stood
beside
the
royal
bed
which
had
ascended
again
after
having
deposited
its
prisoner
in
the
secret
depths
of
the
subterranean
passage
alone
in
the
presence
of
all
the
luxury
which
surrounded
him
alone
in
the
presence
of
his
power
alone
with
the
part
he
was
about
to
be
forced
to
act
philippe
for
the
first
time
felt
his
heart
and
mind
and
soul
expand
beneath
the
influence
of
a
thousand
mutable
emotions
which
are
the
vital
throbs
of
a
kings
heart
he
could
not
help
changing
color
when
he
looked
upon
the
empty
bed
still
tumbled
by

returned
after
having
completed
the
work
it
had
been
destined
to
perform
it

with
the
traces
of
the
crime
it
spoke
to
the
guilty
author
of
that
crime
with
the
frank
and
unreserved
language
which
an
accomplice
never
fears
to
use
in
the
company
of
his
companion

guilt
for
it

the
truth
philippe
bent
over
the
bed
and
perceived
a
pockethandkerchief
lying
on
it
which
was
still
damp
from
the
cold
sweat
which
had
poured
from
louis
xivs
face
this
sweatbestained
handkerchief
terrified
philippe
as
the
gore
of
abel
frightened
cain
i
am
face
to
face
with
my
destiny
said
philippe
his
eyes
on
fire
and
his
face
a
livid
white
is
it
likely
to
be
more
terrifying
than
my
captivity
has
been
sad
and
gloomy
though
i
am
compelled
to
follow
out
at
every
moment
the
sovereign
power
and
authority
i
have
usurped
shall
i
cease
to
listen
to
the
scruples
of
my
heart
yes
the
king
has
lain
on
this
bed
it
is
indeed
his
head
that
has
left
its
impression
on
this
pillow
his
bitter
tears
that
have
stained
this
handkerchief
and
yet
i
hesitate
to
throw
myself
on
the
bed
or
to
press
in
my
hand
the
handkerchief
which
is
embroidered
with
my
brothers
arms
away
with
such
weakness
let
me
imitate
m
dherblay
who
asserts
that
a
mans
action
should
be
always
one
degree
above
his
thoughts
let
me
imitate
m
dherblay
whose
thoughts
are
of
and
for
himself
alone
who
regards
himself
as
a
man
of
honor
so
long
as
he
injures
or
betrays
his
enemies
only
i
i
alone
should
have
occupied
this
bed
if
louis
xiv
had
not
owing
to
my
mothers
criminal
abandonment
stood
in
my
way
and
this
handkerchief
embroidered
with
the
arms
of
france
would
in
right
and
justice
belong
to
me
alone
if
as
m
dherblay
observes
i
had
been
left
my
royal
cradle
philippe
son
of
france
take
your
place
on
that
bed
philippe
sole
king
of
france
resume
the
blazonry
that
is
yours
philippe
sole
heir
presumptive
to
louis
xiii
your
father
show
yourself
without
pity
or
mercy
for
the
usurper
who
at
this
moment
has
not
even
to
suffer
the
agony
of
the
remorse
of
all
that
you
have
had
to
submit
to
with
these
words
philippe
notwithstanding
an
instinctive
repugnance
of
feeling
and
in
spite
of
the
shudder
of
terror
which
mastered
his
will
threw
himself
on
the
royal
bed
and
forced
his
muscles
to
press
the
still
warm
place
where
louis
xiv
had
lain
while
he
buried
his
burning
face
in
the
handkerchief
still
moistened
by
his
brothers
tears
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
buried
in
the
soft
down
of
his
pillow
philippe
perceived
above
him
the
crown
of
france
suspended
as
we
have
stated
by
angels
with
outspread
golden
wings
a
man
may
be
ambitious
of
lying
in
a
lions
den
but
can
hardly
hope
to
sleep
there
quietly
philippe
listened
attentively
to
every
sound
his
heart
panted
and
throbbed
at
the
very
suspicion
of
approaching
terror
and
misfortune
but
confident
in
his
own
strength
which
was
confirmed
by
the
force
of
an
overpoweringly
resolute
determination
he
waited
until
some
decisive
circumstance
should
permit
him
to
judge
for
himself
he
hoped
that
imminent
danger
might
be
revealed
to
him
like
those
phosphoric
lights
of
the
tempest
which
show
the
sailors
the
altitude
of
the
waves
against
which
they
have
to
struggle
but
nothing
approached
silence
that
mortal
enemy
of
restless
hearts
and
of
ambitious
minds
shrouded
in
the
thickness
of
its
gloom
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
the
future
king
of
france
who
lay
there
sheltered
beneath
his
stolen
crown
towards
the
morning
a
shadow
rather
than
a
body
glided
into
the
royal
chamber
philippe
expected
his
approach
and
neither
expressed
nor
exhibited
any
surprise
well
m
dherblay
well
sire
all
is
accomplished
how
exactly
as
we
expected
did
he
resist
terribly
tears
and
entreaties
and
then
a
perfect
stupor
but
at
last
oh
at
last
a
complete
victory
and
absolute
silence
did
the
governor
of
the
bastile
suspect
anything
nothing
the
resemblance
however
was
the
cause
of
the
success
but
the
prisoner
cannot
fail
to
explain
himself
think
well
of
that
i
have
myself
been
able
to
do
as
much
as
that
on
former
occasion
i
have
already
provided
for
every
chance
in
a
few
days
sooner
if
necessary
we
will
take
the
captive
out
of
his
prison
and
will
send
him
out
of
the
country
to
a
place
of
exile
so
remote
people
can
return
from
their
exile
monsieur
dherblay
to
a
place
of
exile
so
distant
i
was
going
to
say
that
human
strength
and
the
duration
of
human
life
would
not
be
enough
for
his
return
once
more
a
cold
look
of
intelligence
passed
between
aramis
and
the
young
king
and
m
du
vallon
asked
philippe
in
order
to
change
the
conversation
he
will
be
presented
to
you
today
and
confidentially
will
congratulate
you
on
the
danger
which
that
conspirator
has
made
you
run
what
is
to
be
done
with
him
with
m
du
vallon
yes
confer
a
dukedom
on
him
i
suppose
a
dukedom
replied
aramis
smiling
in
a
significant
manner
why
do
you
laugh
monsieur
dherblay
i
laugh
at
the
extreme
caution
of
your
idea
cautious
why
so
your
majesty
is
doubtless
afraid
that
poor
porthos
may
possible
become
a
troublesome
witness
and
you
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
what
in
making
him
a
duke
certainly
you
would
assuredly
kill
him
for
he
would
die
from
joy
and
the
secret
would
die
with
him
good
heavens
yes
said
aramis
phlegmatically
i
should
lose
a
very
good
friend
at
this
moment
and
in
the
middle
of
this
idle
conversation
under
the
light
tone
of
which
the
two
conspirators
concealed
their
joy
and
pride
at
their
mutual
success
aramis
heard
something
which
made
him
prick
up
his
ears
what
is
that
said
philippe
the
dawn
sire
well
well
before
you
retired
to
bed
last
night
you
probably
decided
to
do
something
this
morning
at
break
of
day
yes
i
told
my
captain
of
the
musketeers
replied
the
young
man
hurriedly
that
i
should
expect
him
if
you
told
him
that
he
will
certainly
be
here
for
he
is
a
most
punctual
man
i
hear
a
step
in
the
vestibule
it
must
be
he
come
let
us
begin
the
attack
said
the
young
king
resolutely
be
cautious
for
heavens
sake
to
begin
the
attack
and
with
dartagnan
would
be
madness
dartagnan
knows
nothing
he
has
seen
nothing
he
is
a
hundred
miles
from
suspecting
our
mystery
in
the
slightest
degree
but
if
he
comes
into
this
room
the
first
this
morning
he
will
be
sure
to
detect
something
of
what
has
taken
place
and
which
he
would
imagine
it
his
business
to
occupy
himself
about
before
we
allow
dartagnan
to
penetrate
into
this
room
we
must
air
the
room
thoroughly
or
introduce
so
many
people
into
it
that
the
keenest
scent
in
the
whole
kingdom
may
be
deceived
by
the
traces
of
twenty
different
persons
but
how
can
i
send
him
away
since
i
have
given
him
a
rendezvous
observed
the
prince
impatient
to
measure
swords
with
so
redoubtable
an
antagonist
i
will
take
care
of
that
replied
the
bishop
and
in
order
to
begin
i
am
going
to
strike
a
blow
which
will
completely
stupefy
our
man
he
too
is
striking
a
blow
for
i
hear
him
at
the
door
added
the
prince
hurriedly
and
in
fact
a
knock
at
the
door
was
heard
at
that
moment
aramis
was
not
mistaken
for
it
was
indeed
dartagnan
who
adopted
that
mode
of
announcing
himself
we
have
seen
how
he
passed
the
night
in
philosophizing
with
m
fouquet
but
the
musketeer
was
very
weary
even
of
feigning
to
fall
asleep
and
as
soon
as
earliest
dawn
illumined
with
its
gloomy
gleams
of
light
the
sumptuous
cornices
of
the
superintendents
room
dartagnan
rose
from
his
armchair
arranged
his
sword
brushed
his
coat
and
hat
with
his
sleeve
like
a
private
soldier
getting
ready
for
inspection
are
you
going
out
said
fouquet
yes
monseigneur
and
you
i
shall
remain
you
pledge
your
word
certainly
very
good
besides
my
only
reason
for
going
out
is
to
try
and
get
that
replyyou
know
what
i
mean
that
sentence
you
mean
stay
i
have
something
of
the
old
roman
in
me
this
morning
when
i
got
up
i
remarked
that
my
sword
had
got
caught
in
one
of
the
aiguillettes
and
that
my
shoulderbelt
had
slipped
quite
off
that
is
an
infallible
sign
of
prosperity
yes
be
sure
of
it
for
every
time
that
that
confounded
belt
of
mine
stuck
fast
to
my
back
it
always
signified
a
punishment
from
m
de
treville
or
a
refusal
of
money
by
m
de
mazarin
every
time
my
sword
hung
fast
to
my
shoulderbelt
it
always
predicted
some
disagreeable
commission
or
another
for
me
to
execute
and
i
have
had
showers
of
them
all
my
life
through
every
time
too
my
sword
danced
about
in
its
sheath
a
duel
fortunate
in
its
result
was
sure
to
follow
whenever
it
dangled
about
the
calves
of
my
legs
it
signified
a
slight
wound
every
time
it
fell
completely
out
of
the
scabbard
i
was
booked
and
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
have
to
remain
on
the
field
of
battle
with
two
or
three
months
under
surgical
bandages
into
the
bargain
i
did
not
know
your
sword
kept
you
so
well
informed
said
fouquet
with
a
faint
smile
which
showed
how
he
was
struggling
against
his
own
weakness
is
your
sword
bewitched
or
under
the
influence
of
some
imperial
charm
why
you
must
know
that
my
sword
may
almost
be
regarded
as
part
of
my
own
body
i
have
heard
that
certain
men
seem
to
have
warnings
given
them
by
feeling
something
the
matter
with
their
legs
or
a
throbbing
of
their
temples
with
me
it
is
my
sword
that
warns
me
well
it
told
me
of
nothing
this
morning
but
stay
a
momentlook
here
it
has
just
fallen
of
its
own
accord
into
the
last
hole
of
the
belt
do
you
know
what
that
is
a
warning
of
no
well
that
tells
me
of
an
arrest
that
will
have
to
be
made
this
very
day
well
said
the
surintendant
more
astonished
than
annoyed
by
this
frankness
if
there
is
nothing
disagreeable
predicted
to
you
by
your
sword
i
am
to
conclude
that
it
is
not
disagreeable
for
you
to
arrest
me
you
arrest
you
of
course
the
warning
does
not
concern
you
since
you
have
been
arrested
ever
since
yesterday
it
is
not
you
i
shall
have
to
arrest
be
assured
of
that
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
delighted
and
also
the
reason
why
i
said
that
my
day
will
be
a
happy
one
and
with
these
words
pronounced
with
the
most
affectionate
graciousness
of
manner
the
captain
took
leave
of
fouquet
in
order
to
wait
upon
the
king
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
when
fouquet
said
to
him
one
last
mark
of
kindness
what
is
it
monseigneur
m
dherblay
let
me
see
monsieur
dherblay
i
am
going
to
try
and
get
him
to
come
to
you
dartagnan
did
not
think
himself
so
good
a
prophet
it
was
written
that
the
day
would
pass
away
and
realize
all
the
predictions
that
had
been
made
in
the
morning
he
had
accordingly
knocked
as
we
have
seen
at
the
kings
door
the
door
opened
the
captain
thought
that
it
was
the
king
who
had
just
opened
it
himself
and
this
supposition
was
not
altogether
inadmissible
considering
the
state
of
agitation
in
which
he
had
left
louis
xiv
the
previous
evening
but
instead
of
his
royal
master
whom
he
was
on
the
point
of
saluting
with
the
greatest
respect
he
perceived
the
long
calm
features
of
aramis
so
extreme
was
his
surprise
that
he
could
hardly
refrain
from
uttering
a
loud
exclamation
aramis
he
said
good
morning
dear
dartagnan
replied
the
prelate
coldly
you
here
stammered
out
the
musketeer
his
majesty
desires
you
to
report
that
he
is
still
sleeping
after
having
been
greatly
fatigued
during
the
whole
night
ah
said
dartagnan
who
could
not
understand
how
the
bishop
of
vannes
who
had
been
so
indifferent
a
favorite
the
previous
evening
had
become
in
half
a
dozen
hours
the
most
magnificent
mushroom
of
fortune
that
had
ever
sprung
up
in
a
sovereigns
bedroom
in
fact
to
transmit
the
orders
of
the
king
even
to
the
mere
threshold
of
that
monarchs
room
to
serve
as
an
intermediary
of
louis
xiv
so
as
to
be
able
to
give
a
single
order
in
his
name
at
a
couple
paces
from
him
he
must
have
become
more
than
richelieu
had
ever
been
to
louis
xiii
dartagnans
expressive
eye
halfopened
lips
his
curling
mustache
said
as
much
indeed
in
the
plainest
language
to
the
chief
favorite
who
remained
calm
and
perfectly
unmoved
moreover
continued
the
bishop
you
will
be
good
enough
monsieur
le
capitaine
des
mousquetaires
to
allow
those
only
to
pass
into
the
kings
room
this
morning
who
have
special
permission
his
majesty
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
just
yet
but
objected
dartagnan
almost
on
the
point
of
refusing
to
obey
this
order
and
particularly
of
giving
unrestrained
passage
to
the
suspicions
which
the
kings
silence
had
arousedbut
monsieur
leveque
his
majesty
gave
me
a
rendezvous
for
this
morning
later
later
said
the
kings
voice
from
the
bottom
of
the
alcove
a
voice
which
made
a
cold
shudder
pass
through
the
musketeers
veins
he
bowed
amazed
confused
and
stupefied
by
the
smile
with
which
aramis
seemed
to
overwhelm
him
as
soon
as
these
words
had
been
pronounced
and
then
continued
the
bishop
as
an
answer
to
what
you
were
coming
to
ask
the
king
my
dear
dartagnan
here
is
an
order
of
his
majesty
which
you
will
be
good
enough
to
attend
to
forthwith
for
it
concerns
m
fouquet
dartagnan
took
the
order
which
was
held
out
to
him
to
be
set
at
liberty
he
murmured
ah
and
he
uttered
a
second
ah
still
more
full
of
intelligence
than
the
former
for
this
order
explained
aramiss
presence
with
the
king
and
that
aramis
in
order
to
have
obtained
fouquets
pardon
must
have
made
considerable
progress
in
the
royal
favor
and
that
this
favor
explained
in
its
tenor
the
hardly
conceivable
assurance
with
which
m
dherblay
issued
the
order
in
the
kings
name
for
dartagnan
it
was
quite
sufficient
to
have
understood
something
of
the
matter
in
hand
to
order
to
understand
the
rest
he
bowed
and
withdrew
a
couple
of
paces
as
though
he
were
about
to
leave
i
am
going
with
you
said
the
bishop
where
to
to
m
fouquet
i
wish
to
be
a
witness
of
his
delight
ah
aramis
how
you
puzzled
me
just
now
said
dartagnan
again
but
you
understand
now
i
suppose
of
course
i
understand
he
said
aloud
but
added
in
a
low
tone
to
himself
almost
hissing
the
words
between
his
teeth
no
no
i
do
not
understand
yet
but
it
is
all
the
same
for
here
is
the
order
for
it
and
then
he
added
i
will
lead
the
way
monseigneur
and
he
conducted
aramis
to
fouquets
apartments
chapter
xxi
the
kings
friend
fouquet
was
waiting
with
anxiety
he
had
already
sent
away
many
of
his
servants
and
friends
who
anticipating
the
usual
hour
of
his
ordinary
receptions
had
called
at
his
door
to
inquire
after
him
preserving
the
utmost
silence
respecting
the
danger
which
hung
suspended
by
a
hair
above
his
head
he
only
asked
them
as
he
did
every
one
indeed
who
came
to
the
door
where
aramis
was
when
he
saw
dartagnan
return
and
when
he
perceived
the
bishop
of
vannes
behind
him
he
could
hardly
restrain
his
delight
it
was
fully
equal
to
his
previous
uneasiness
the
mere
sight
of
aramis
was
a
complete
compensation
to
the
surintendant
for
the
unhappiness
he
had
undergone
in
his
arrest
the
prelate
was
silent
and
grave
dartagnan
completely
bewildered
by
such
an
accumulation
of
events
well
captain
so
you
have
brought
m
dherblay
to
me
and
something
better
still
monseigneur
what
is
that
liberty
i
am
free
yes
by
the
kings
order
fouquet
resumed
his
usual
serenity
that
he
might
interrogate
aramis
with
a
look
oh
yes
you
can
thank
m
leveque
de
vannes
pursued
dartagnan
for
it
is
indeed
to
him
that
you
owe
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
the
king
oh
said
fouquet
more
humiliated
at
the
service
than
grateful
at
its
success
but
you
continued
dartagnan
addressing
aramisyou
who
have
become
m
fouquets
protector
and
patron
can
you
not
do
something
for
me
anything
in
the
wide
world
you
like
my
friend
replied
the
bishop
in
his
calmest
tones
one
thing
only
then
and
i
shall
be
perfectly
satisfied
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
to
become
the
favorite
of
the
king
you
who
have
never
spoken
to
him
more
than
twice
in
your
life
from
a
friend
such
as
you
are
said
aramis
i
cannot
conceal
anything
ah
very
good
tell
me
then
very
well
you
think
that
i
have
seen
the
king
only
twice
whilst
the
fact
is
i
have
seen
him
more
than
a
hundred
times
only
we
have
kept
it
very
secret
that
is
all
and
without
trying
to
remove
the
color
which
at
this
revelation
made
dartagnans
face
flush
scarlet
aramis
turned
towards
m
fouquet
who
was
as
much
surprised
as
the
musketeer
monseigneur
he
resumed
the
king
desires
me
to
inform
you
that
he
is
more
than
ever
your
friend
and
that
your
beautiful
fete
so
generously
offered
by
you
on
his
behalf
has
touched
him
to
the
very
heart
and
thereupon
he
saluted
m
fouquet
with
so
much
reverence
of
manner
that
the
latter
incapable
of
understanding
a
man
whose
diplomacy
was
of
so
prodigious
a
character
remained
incapable
of
uttering
a
single
syllable
and
equally
incapable
of
thought
or
movement
dartagnan
fancied
he
perceived
that
these
two
men
had
something
to
say
to
each
other
and
he
was
about
to
yield
to
that
feeling
of
instinctive
politeness
which
in
such
a
case
hurries
a
man
towards
the
door
when
he
feels
his
presence
is
an
inconvenience
for
others
but
his
eager
curiosity
spurred
on
by
so
many
mysteries
counseled
him
to
remain
aramis
thereupon
turned
towards
him
and
said
in
a
quiet
tone
you
will
not
forget
my
friend
the
kings
order
respecting
those
whom
he
intends
to
receive
this
morning
on
rising
these
words
were
clear
enough
and
the
musketeer
understood
them
he
therefore
bowed
to
fouquet
and
then
to
aramisto
the
latter
with
a
slight
admixture
of
ironical
respectand
disappeared
no
sooner
had
he
left
than
fouquet
whose
impatience
had
hardly
been
able
to
wait
for
that
moment
darted
towards
the
door
to
close
it
and
then
returning
to
the
bishop
he
said
my
dear
dherblay
i
think
it
now
high
time
you
should
explain
all
that
has
passed
for
in
plain
and
honest
truth
i
do
not
understand
anything
we
will
explain
all
that
to
you
said
aramis
sitting
down
and
making
fouquet
sit
down
also
where
shall
i
begin
with
this
first
of
all
why
does
the
king
set
me
at
liberty
you
ought
rather
to
ask
me
what
his
reason
was
for
having
you
arrested
since
my
arrest
i
have
had
time
to
think
over
it
and
my
idea
is
that
it
arises
out
of
some
slight
feeling
of
jealousy
my
fete
put
m
colbert
out
of
temper
and
m
colbert
discovered
some
cause
of
complaint
against
me
belleisle
for
instance
no
there
is
no
question
at
all
just
now
of
belleisle
what
is
it
then
do
you
remember
those
receipts
for
thirteen
millions
which
m
de
mazarin
contrived
to
steal
from
you
yes
of
course
well
you
are
pronounced
a
public
robber
good
heavens
oh
that
is
not
all
do
you
also
remember
that
letter
you
wrote
to
la
valliere
alas
yes
and
that
proclaims
you
a
traitor
and
a
suborner
why
should
he
have
pardoned
me
then
we
have
not
yet
arrived
at
that
part
of
our
argument
i
wish
you
to
be
quite
convinced
of
the
fact
itself
observe
this
well
the
king
knows
you
to
be
guilty
of
an
appropriation
of
public
funds
oh
of
course
i
know
that
you
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
but
at
all
events
the
king
has
seen
the
receipts
and
he
can
do
no
other
than
believe
you
are
incriminated
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
not
see
you
will
see
presently
though
the
king
moreover
having
read
your
loveletter
to
la
valliere
and
the
offers
you
there
made
her
cannot
retain
any
doubt
of
your
intentions
with
regard
to
that
young
lady
you
will
admit
that
i
suppose
certainly
pray
conclude
in
the
fewest
words
the
king
we
may
henceforth
assume
is
your
powerful
implacable
and
eternal
enemy
agreed
but
am
i
then
so
powerful
that
he
has
not
dared
to
sacrifice
me
notwithstanding
his
hatred
with
all
the
means
which
my
weakness
or
my
misfortunes
may
have
given
him
as
a
hold
upon
me
it
is
clear
beyond
all
doubt
pursued
aramis
coldly
that
the
king
has
quarreled
with
youirreconcilably
but
since
he
has
absolved
me
do
you
believe
it
likely
asked
the
bishop
with
a
searching
look
without
believing
in
his
sincerity
i
believe
it
in
the
accomplished
fact
aramis
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
why
then
should
louis
xiv
have
commissioned
you
to
tell
me
what
you
have
just
stated
the
king
charged
me
with
no
message
for
you
with
nothing
said
the
superintendent
stupefied
but
that
order
oh
yes
you
are
quite
right
there
is
an
order
certainly
and
these
words
were
pronounced
by
aramis
in
so
strange
a
tone
that
fouquet
could
not
resist
starting
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
i
see
what
is
it
aramis
softly
rubbed
his
white
fingers
over
his
chin
but
said
nothing
does
the
king
exile
me
do
not
act
as
if
you
were
playing
at
the
game
children
play
at
when
they
have
to
try
and
guess
where
a
thing
has
been
hidden
and
are
informed
by
a
bell
being
rung
when
they
are
approaching
near
to
it
or
going
away
from
it
speak
then
guess
you
alarm
me
bah
that
is
because
you
have
not
guessed
then
what
did
the
king
say
to
you
in
the
name
of
our
friendship
do
not
deceive
me
the
king
has
not
said
one
word
to
me
you
are
killing
me
with
impatience
dherblay
am
i
still
superintendent
as
long
as
you
like
but
what
extraordinary
empire
have
you
so
suddenly
acquired
over
his
majestys
mind
ah
thats
the
point
he
does
your
bidding
i
believe
so
it
is
hardly
credible
so
any
one
would
say
dherblay
by
our
alliance
by
our
friendship
by
everything
you
hold
dearest
in
the
world
speak
openly
i
implore
you
by
what
means
have
you
succeeded
in
overcoming
louis
xivs
prejudices
for
he
did
not
like
you
i
am
certain
the
king
will
like
me
now
said
aramis
laying
stress
upon
the
last
word
you
have
something
particular
then
between
you
yes
a
secret
perhaps
a
secret
a
secret
of
such
a
nature
as
to
change
his
majestys
interests
you
are
indeed
a
man
of
superior
intelligence
monseigneur
and
have
made
a
particularly
accurate
guess
i
have
in
fact
discovered
a
secret
of
a
nature
to
change
the
interests
of
the
king
of
france
ah
said
fouquet
with
the
reserve
of
a
man
who
does
not
wish
to
ask
any
more
questions
and
you
shall
judge
of
it
yourself
pursued
aramis
and
you
shall
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken
with
regard
to
the
importance
of
this
secret
i
am
listening
since
you
are
good
enough
to
unbosom
yourself
to
me
only
do
not
forget
that
i
have
asked
you
about
nothing
which
it
may
be
indiscreet
in
you
to
communicate
aramis
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
collecting
himself
do
not
speak
said
fouquet
there
is
still
time
enough
do
you
remember
said
the
bishop
casting
down
his
eyes
the
birth
of
louis
xiv
as
if
it
were
yesterday
have
you
ever
heard
anything
particular
respecting
his
birth
nothing
except
that
the
king
was
not
really
the
son
of
louis
xiii
that
does
not
matter
to
us
or
the
kingdom
either
he
is
the
son
of
his
father
says
the
french
law
whose
father
is
recognized
by
law
true
but
it
is
a
grave
matter
when
the
quality
of
races
is
called
into
question
a
merely
secondary
question
after
all
so
that
in
fact
you
have
never
learned
or
heard
anything
in
particular
nothing
that
is
where
my
secret
begins
the
queen
you
must
know
instead
of
being
delivered
of
a
son
was
delivered
of
twins
fouquet
looked
up
suddenly
as
he
replied
and
the
second
is
dead
you
will
see
these
twins
seemed
likely
to
be
regarded
as
the
pride
of
their
mother
and
the
hope
of
france
but
the
weak
nature
of
the
king
his
superstitious
feelings
made
him
apprehend
a
series
of
conflicts
between
two
children
whose
rights
were
equal
so
he
put
out
of
the
wayhe
suppressedone
of
the
twins
suppressed
do
you
say
have
patience
both
the
children
grew
up
the
one
on
the
throne
whose
minister
you
arethe
other
who
is
my
friend
in
gloom
and
isolation
good
heavens
what
are
you
saying
monsieur
dherblay
and
what
is
this
poor
prince
doing
ask
me
rather
what
has
he
done
yes
yes
he
was
brought
up
in
the
country
and
then
thrown
into
a
fortress
which
goes
by
the
name
of
the
bastile
is
it
possible
cried
the
surintendant
clasping
his
hands
the
one
was
the
most
fortunate
of
men
the
other
the
most
unhappy
and
miserable
of
all
living
beings
does
his
mother
not
know
this
anne
of
austria
knows
it
all
and
the
king
knows
absolutely
nothing
so
much
the
better
said
fouquet
this
remark
seemed
to
make
a
great
impression
on
aramis
he
looked
at
fouquet
with
the
most
anxious
expression
of
countenance
i
beg
your
pardon
i
interrupted
you
said
fouquet
i
was
saying
resumed
aramis
that
this
poor
prince
was
the
unhappiest
of
human
beings
when
heaven
whose
thoughts
are
over
all
his
creatures
undertook
to
come
to
his
assistance
oh
in
what
way
tell
me
you
will
see
the
reigning
kingi
say
the
reigning
kingyou
can
guess
very
well
why
no
why
because
both
of
them
being
legitimate
princes
ought
to
have
been
kings
is
not
that
your
opinion
it
is
certainly
unreservedly
most
unreservedly
twins
are
one
person
in
two
bodies
i
am
pleased
that
a
legist
of
your
learning
and
authority
should
have
pronounced
such
an
opinion
it
is
agreed
then
that
each
of
them
possessed
equal
rights
is
it
not
incontestably
but
gracious
heavens
what
an
extraordinary
circumstance
we
are
not
at
the
end
of
it
yetpatience
oh
i
shall
find
patience
enough
heaven
wished
to
raise
up
for
that
oppressed
child
an
avenger
or
a
supporter
or
vindicator
if
you
prefer
it
it
happened
that
the
reigning
king
the
usurperyou
are
quite
of
my
opinion
i
believe
that
it
is
an
act
of
usurpation
quietly
to
enjoy
and
selfishly
to
assume
the
right
over
an
inheritance
to
which
a
man
has
only
half
a
right
yes
usurpation
is
the
word
in
that
case
i
continue
it
was
heavens
will
that
the
usurper
should
possess
in
the
person
of
his
first
minister
a
man
of
great
talent
of
large
and
generous
nature
well
well
said
fouquet
i
understand
you
you
have
relied
upon
me
to
repair
the
wrong
which
has
been
done
to
this
unhappy
brother
of
louis
xiv
you
have
thought
well
i
will
help
you
i
thank
you
dherblay
i
thank
you
oh
no
it
is
not
that
at
all
you
have
not
allowed
me
to
finish
said
aramis
perfectly
unmoved
i
will
not
say
another
word
then
m
fouquet
i
was
observing
the
minister
of
the
reigning
sovereign
was
suddenly
taken
into
the
greatest
aversion
and
menaced
with
the
ruin
of
his
fortune
loss
of
liberty
loss
of
life
even
by
intrigue
and
personal
hatred
to
which
the
king
gave
too
readily
an
attentive
ear
but
heaven
permits
still
however
out
of
consideration
for
the
unhappy
prince
who
had
been
sacrificed
that
m
fouquet
should
in
his
turn
have
a
devoted
friend
who
knew
this
state
secret
and
felt
that
he
possessed
strength
and
courage
enough
to
divulge
this
secret
after
having
had
the
strength
to
carry
it
locked
up
in
his
own
heart
for
twenty
years
go
no
farther
said
fouquet
full
of
generous
feelings
i
understand
you
and
can
guess
everything
now
you
went
to
see
the
king
when
the
intelligence
of
my
arrest
reached
you
you
implored
him
he
refused
to
listen
to
you
then
you
threatened
him
with
that
secret
threatened
to
reveal
it
and
louis
xiv
alarmed
at
the
risk
of
its
betrayal
granted
to
the
terror
of
your
indiscretion
what
he
refused
to
your
generous
intercession
i
understand
i
understand
you
have
the
king
in
your
power
i
understand
you
understand
nothingas
yet
replied
aramis
and
again
you
interrupt
me
then
too
allow
me
to
observe
that
you
pay
no
attention
to
logical
reasoning
and
seem
to
forget
what
you
ought
most
to
remember
what
do
you
mean
you
know
upon
what
i
laid
the
greatest
stress
at
the
beginning
of
our
conversation
yes
his
majestys
hate
invincible
hate
for
me
yes
but
what
feeling
of
hate
could
resist
the
threat
of
such
a
revelation
such
a
revelation
do
you
say
that
is
the
very
point
where
your
logic
fails
you
what
do
you
suppose
that
if
i
had
made
such
a
revelation
to
the
king
i
should
have
been
alive
now
it
is
not
ten
minutes
ago
that
you
were
with
the
king
that
may
be
he
might
not
have
had
the
time
to
get
me
killed
outright
but
he
would
have
had
the
time
to
get
me
gagged
and
thrown
in
a
dungeon
come
come
show
a
little
consistency
in
your
reasoning
mordieu
and
by
the
mere
use
of
this
word
which
was
so
thoroughly
his
old
musketeers
expression
forgotten
by
one
who
never
seemed
to
forget
anything
fouquet
could
not
but
understand
to
what
a
pitch
of
exaltation
the
calm
impenetrable
bishop
of
vannes
had
wrought
himself
he
shuddered
and
then
replied
the
latter
after
having
mastered
his
feelings
should
i
be
the
man
i
really
am
should
i
be
the
true
friend
you
believe
me
if
i
were
to
expose
you
whom
the
king
already
hates
so
bitterly
to
a
feeling
more
than
ever
to
be
dreaded
in
that
young
man
to
have
robbed
him
is
nothing
to
have
addressed
the
woman
he
loves
is
not
much
but
to
hold
in
your
keeping
both
his
crown
and
his
honor
why
he
would
pluck
out
your
heart
with
his
own
hands
you
have
not
allowed
him
to
penetrate
your
secret
then
i
would
sooner
far
sooner
have
swallowed
at
one
draught
all
the
poisons
that
mithridates
drank
in
twenty
years
in
order
to
try
and
avoid
death
than
have
betrayed
my
secret
to
the
king
what
have
you
done
then
ah
now
we
are
coming
to
the
point
monseigneur
i
think
i
shall
not
fail
to
excite
in
you
a
little
interest
you
are
listening
i
hope
how
can
you
ask
me
if
i
am
listening
go
on
aramis
walked
softly
all
round
the
room
satisfied
himself
that
they
were
alone
and
that
all
was
silent
and
then
returned
and
placed
himself
close
to
the
armchair
in
which
fouquet
was
seated
awaiting
with
the
deepest
anxiety
the
revelation
he
had
to
make
i
forgot
to
tell
you
resumed
aramis
addressing
himself
to
fouquet
who
listened
to
him
with
the
most
absorbed
attentioni
forgot
to
mention
a
most
remarkable
circumstance
respecting
these
twins
namely
that
god
had
formed
them
so
startlingly
so
miraculously
like
each
other
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
their
own
mother
would
not
be
able
to
distinguish
them
is
it
possible
exclaimed
fouquet
the
same
noble
character
in
their
features
the
same
carriage
the
same
stature
the
same
voice
but
their
thoughts
degree
of
intelligence
their
knowledge
of
human
life
there
is
inequality
there
i
admit
monseigneur
yes
for
the
prisoner
of
the
bastile
is
most
incontestably
superior
in
every
way
to
his
brother
and
if
from
his
prison
this
unhappy
victim
were
to
pass
to
the
throne
france
would
not
from
the
earliest
period
of
its
history
perhaps
have
had
a
master
more
powerful
in
genius
and
nobility
of
character
fouquet
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
as
if
he
were
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
this
immense
secret
aramis
approached
him
there
is
a
further
inequality
he
said
continuing
his
work
of
temptation
an
inequality
which
concerns
yourself
monseigneur
between
the
twins
both
sons
of
louis
xiii
namely
the
last
comer
does
not
know
m
colbert
fouquet
raised
his
head
immediatelyhis
features
were
pale
and
distorted
the
bolt
had
hit
its
marknot
his
heart
but
his
mind
and
comprehension
i
understand
you
he
said
to
aramis
you
are
proposing
a
conspiracy
to
me
something
like
it
one
of
those
attempts
which
as
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
conversation
alters
the
fate
of
empires
and
of
superintendents
too
yes
monseigneur
in
a
word
you
propose
that
i
should
agree
to
the
substitution
of
the
son
of
louis
xiii
who
is
now
a
prisoner
in
the
bastile
for
the
son
of
louis
xiii
who
is
at
this
moment
asleep
in
the
chamber
of
morpheus
aramis
smiled
with
the
sinister
expression
of
the
sinister
thought
which
was
passing
through
his
brain
exactly
he
said
have
you
thought
continued
fouquet
becoming
animated
with
that
strength
of
talent
which
in
a
few
seconds
originates
and
matures
the
conception
of
a
plan
and
with
that
largeness
of
view
which
foresees
all
consequences
and
embraces
every
result
at
a
glancehave
you
thought
that
we
must
assemble
the
nobility
the
clergy
and
the
third
estate
of
the
realm
that
we
shall
have
to
depose
the
reigning
sovereign
to
disturb
by
so
frightful
a
scandal
the
tomb
of
their
dead
father
to
sacrifice
the
life
the
honor
of
a
woman
anne
of
austria
the
life
and
peace
of
mind
and
heart
of
another
woman
maria
theresa
and
suppose
that
it
were
all
done
if
we
were
to
succeed
in
doing
it
i
do
not
understand
you
continued
aramis
coldly
there
is
not
a
single
syllable
of
sense
in
all
you
have
just
said
what
said
the
superintendent
surprised
a
man
like
you
refuse
to
view
the
practical
bearing
of
the
case
do
you
confine
yourself
to
the
childish
delight
of
a
political
illusion
and
neglect
the
chances
of
its
being
carried
into
execution
in
other
words
the
reality
itself
is
it
possible
my
friend
said
aramis
emphasizing
the
word
with
a
kind
of
disdainful
familiarity
what
does
heaven
do
in
order
to
substitute
one
king
for
another
heaven
exclaimed
fouquetheaven
gives
directions
to
its
agent
who
seizes
upon
the
doomed
victim
hurries
him
away
and
seats
the
triumphant
rival
on
the
empty
throne
but
you
forget
that
this
agent
is
called
death
oh
monsieur
dherblay
in
heavens
name
tell
me
if
you
have
had
the
idea
there
is
no
question
of
that
monseigneur
you
are
going
beyond
the
object
in
view
who
spoke
of
louis
xivs
death
who
spoke
of
adopting
the
example
which
heaven
sets
in
following
out
the
strict
execution
of
its
decrees
no
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
heaven
effects
its
purposes
without
confusion
or
disturbance
without
exciting
comment
or
remark
without
difficulty
or
exertion
and
that
men
inspired
by
heaven
succeed
like
heaven
itself
in
all
their
undertakings
in
all
they
attempt
in
all
they
do
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
my
friend
returned
aramis
with
the
same
intonation
on
the
word
friend
that
he
had
applied
to
it
the
first
timei
mean
that
if
there
has
been
any
confusion
scandal
and
even
effort
in
the
substitution
of
the
prisoner
for
the
king
i
defy
you
to
prove
it
what
cried
fouquet
whiter
than
the
handkerchief
with
which
he
wiped
his
temples
what
do
you
say
go
to
the
kings
apartment
continued
aramis
tranquilly
and
you
who
know
the
mystery
i
defy
even
you
to
perceive
that
the
prisoner
of
the
bastile
is
lying
in
his
brothers
bed
but
the
king
stammered
fouquet
seized
with
horror
at
the
intelligence
what
king
said
aramis
in
his
gentlest
tone
the
one
who
hates
you
or
the
one
who
likes
you
the
kingofyesterday
the
king
of
yesterday
be
quite
easy
on
that
score
he
has
gone
to
take
the
place
in
the
bastile
which
his
victim
occupied
for
so
many
years
great
god
and
who
took
him
there
i
you
yes
and
in
the
simplest
way
i
carried
him
away
last
night
while
he
was
descending
into
midnight
the
other
was
ascending
into
day
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
any
disturbance
whatever
a
flash
of
lightning
without
thunder
awakens
nobody
fouquet
uttered
a
thick
smothered
cry
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
some
invisible
blow
and
clasping
his
head
between
his
clenched
hands
he
murmured
you
did
that
cleverly
enough
too
what
do
you
think
of
it
you
dethroned
the
king
imprisoned
him
too
yes
that
has
been
done
and
such
an
action
was
committed
here
at
vaux
yes
here
at
vaux
in
the
chamber
of
morpheus
it
would
almost
seem
that
it
had
been
built
in
anticipation
of
such
an
act
and
at
what
time
did
it
occur
last
night
between
twelve
and
one
oclock
fouquet
made
a
movement
as
if
he
were
on
the
point
of
springing
upon
aramis
he
restrained
himself
at
vaux
under
my
roof
he
said
in
a
halfstrangled
voice
i
believe
so
for
it
is
still
your
house
and
it
is
likely
to
continue
so
since
m
colbert
cannot
rob
you
of
it
now
it
was
under
my
roof
then
monsieur
that
you
committed
this
crime
this
crime
said
aramis
stupefied
this
abominable
crime
pursued
fouquet
becoming
more
and
more
excited
this
crime
more
execrable
than
an
assassination
this
crime
which
dishonors
my
name
forever
and
entails
upon
me
the
horror
of
posterity
you
are
not
in
your
senses
monsieur
replied
aramis
in
an
irresolute
tone
of
voice
you
are
speaking
too
loudly
take
care
i
will
call
out
so
loudly
that
the
whole
world
shall
hear
me
monsieur
fouquet
take
care
fouquet
turned
round
towards
the
prelate
whom
he
looked
at
full
in
the
face
you
have
dishonored
me
he
said
in
committing
so
foul
an
act
of
treason
so
heinous
a
crime
upon
my
guest
upon
one
who
was
peacefully
reposing
beneath
my
roof
oh
woe
woe
is
me
woe
to
the
man
rather
who
beneath
your
roof
meditated
the
ruin
of
your
fortune
your
life
do
you
forget
that
he
was
my
guest
my
sovereign
aramis
rose
his
eyes
literally
bloodshot
his
mouth
trembling
convulsively
have
i
a
man
out
of
his
senses
to
deal
with
he
said
you
have
an
honorable
man
to
deal
with
you
are
mad
a
man
who
will
prevent
you
consummating
your
crime
you
are
mad
i
say
a
man
who
would
sooner
oh
far
sooner
die
who
would
kill
you
even
rather
than
allow
you
to
complete
his
dishonor
and
fouquet
snatched
up
his
sword
which
dartagnan
had
placed
at
the
head
of
his
bed
and
clenched
it
resolutely
in
his
hand
aramis
frowned
and
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast
as
if
in
search
of
a
weapon
this
movement
did
not
escape
fouquet
who
full
of
nobleness
and
pride
in
his
magnanimity
threw
his
sword
to
a
distance
from
him
and
approached
aramis
so
close
as
to
touch
his
shoulder
with
his
disarmed
hand
monsieur
he
said
i
would
sooner
die
here
on
the
spot
than
survive
this
terrible
disgrace
and
if
you
have
any
pity
left
for
me
i
entreat
you
to
take
my
life
aramis
remained
silent
and
motionless
you
do
not
reply
said
fouquet
aramis
raised
his
head
gently
and
a
glimmer
of
hope
might
be
seen
once
more
to
animate
his
eyes
reflect
monseigneur
he
said
upon
everything
we
have
to
expect
as
the
matter
now
stands
the
king
is
still
alive
and
his
imprisonment
saves
your
life
yes
replied
fouquet
you
may
have
been
acting
on
my
behalf
but
i
will
not
do
not
accept
your
services
but
first
of
all
i
do
not
wish
your
ruin
you
will
leave
this
house
aramis
stifled
the
exclamation
which
almost
escaped
his
broken
heart
i
am
hospitable
towards
all
who
are
dwellers
beneath
my
roof
continued
fouquet
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
majesty
you
will
not
be
more
fatally
lost
than
he
whose
ruin
you
have
consummated
you
will
be
so
said
aramis
in
a
hoarse
prophetic
voice
you
will
be
so
believe
me
i
accept
the
augury
monsieur
dherblay
but
nothing
shall
prevent
me
nothing
shall
stop
me
you
will
leave
vauxyou
must
leave
france
i
give
you
four
hours
to
place
yourself
out
of
the
kings
reach
four
hours
said
aramis
scornfully
and
incredulously
upon
the
word
of
fouquet
no
one
shall
follow
you
before
the
expiration
of
that
time
you
will
therefore
have
four
hours
advance
of
those
whom
the
king
may
wish
to
dispatch
after
you
four
hours
repeated
aramis
in
a
thick
smothered
voice
it
is
more
than
you
will
need
to
get
on
board
a
vessel
and
flee
to
belleisle
which
i
give
you
as
a
place
of
refuge
ah
murmured
aramis
belleisle
is
as
much
mine
for
you
as
vaux
is
mine
for
the
king
go
dherblay
go
as
long
as
i
live
not
a
hair
of
your
head
shall
be
injured
thank
you
said
aramis
with
a
cold
irony
of
manner
go
at
once
then
and
give
me
your
hand
before
we
both
hasten
away
you
to
save
your
life
i
to
save
my
honor
aramis
withdrew
from
his
breast
the
hand
he
had
concealed
there
it
was
stained
with
his
blood
he
had
dug
his
nails
into
his
flesh
as
if
in
punishment
for
having
nursed
so
many
projects
more
vain
insensate
and
fleeting
than
the
life
of
the
man
himself
fouquet
was
horrorstricken
and
then
his
heart
smote
him
with
pity
he
threw
open
his
arms
as
if
to
embrace
him
i
had
no
arms
murmured
aramis
as
wild
and
terrible
in
his
wrath
as
the
shade
of
dido
and
then
without
touching
fouquets
hand
he
turned
his
head
aside
and
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
his
last
word
was
an
imprecation
his
last
gesture
a
curse
which
his
bloodstained
hand
seemed
to
invoke
as
it
sprinkled
on
fouquets
face
a
few
drops
of
blood
which
flowed
from
his
breast
and
both
of
them
darted
out
of
the
room
by
the
secret
staircase
which
led
down
to
the
inner
courtyard
fouquet
ordered
his
best
horses
while
aramis
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
which
led
to
porthoss
apartment
he
reflected
profoundly
and
for
some
time
while
fouquets
carriage
left
the
courtyard
at
full
gallop
shall
i
go
alone
said
aramis
to
himself
or
warn
the
prince
oh
fury

the
prince
and
thendo
what

war
implacable
in
its
nature
and
without
any

is
impossible
what
could
he
do
without

oh
without

flee
to
belleisle
yes
and
leave
porthos
behind
me
to
talk
and
relate
the
whole
affair
to
every
one
porthos
too
who
will
have
to
suffer
for
what
he
has
done
i
will
not
let
poor
porthos
suffer
he
seems
like
one
of
the
members
of
my
own
frame
and
his
grief
or
misfortune
would
be
mine
as
well
porthos
shall
leave
with
me
and
shall
follow
my
destiny
it
must
be
so
and
aramis
apprehensive
of
meeting
any
one
to
whom
his
hurried
movements
might
appear
suspicious
ascended
the
staircase
without
being
perceived
porthos
so
recently
returned
from
paris
was
already
in
a
profound
sleep
his
huge
body
forgot
its
fatigue
as
his
mind
forgot
its
thoughts
aramis
entered
light
as
a
shadow
and
placed
his
nervous
grasp
on
the
giants
shoulder
come
porthos
he
cried
come
porthos
obeyed
rose
from
his
bed
opened
his
eyes
even
before
his
intelligence
seemed
to
be
aroused
we
leave
immediately
said
aramis
ah
returned
porthos
we
shall
go
mounted
and
faster
than
we
have
ever
gone
in
our
lives
ah
repeated
porthos
dress
yourself
my
friend
and
he
helped
the
giant
to
dress
himself
and
thrust
his
gold
and
diamonds
into
his
pocket
whilst
he
was
thus
engaged
a
slight
noise
attracted
his
attention
and
on
looking
up
he
saw
dartagnan
watching
them
through
the
halfopened
door
aramis
started
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
there
in
such
an
agitated
manner
said
the
musketeer
hush
said
porthos
we
are
going
off
on
a
mission
of
great
importance
added
the
bishop
you
are
very
fortunate
said
the
musketeer
oh
dear
me
said
porthos
i
feel
so
wearied
i
would
far
sooner
have
been
fast
asleep
but
the
service
of
the
king
have
you
seen
m
fouquet
said
aramis
to
dartagnan
yes
this
very
minute
in
a
carriage
what
did
he
say
to
you
adieu
nothing
more
was
that
all
what
else
do
you
think
he
could
say
am
i
worth
anything
now
since
you
have
got
into
such
high
favor
listen
said
aramis
embracing
the
musketeer
your
good
times
are
returning
again
you
will
have
no
occasion
to
be
jealous
of
any
one
ah
bah
i
predict
that
something
will
happen
to
you
today
which
will
increase
your
importance
more
than
ever
really
you
know
that
i
know
all
the
news
oh
yes
come
porthos
are
you
ready
let
us
go
i
am
quite
ready
aramis
let
us
embrace
dartagnan
first
most
certainly
but
the
horses
oh
there
is
no
want
of
them
here
will
you
have
mine
no
porthos
has
his
own
stud
so
adieu
adieu
the
fugitives
mounted
their
horses
beneath
the
very
eyes
of
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
who
held
porthoss
stirrup
for
him
and
gazed
after
them
until
they
were
out
of
sight
on
any
other
occasion
thought
the
gascon
i
should
say
that
those
gentlemen
were
making
their
escape
but
in
these
days
politics
seem
so
changed
that
such
an
exit
is
termed
going
on
a
mission
i
have
no
objection
let
me
attend
to
my
own
affairs
that
is
more
than
enough
for
meand
he
philosophically
entered
his
apartments
chapter
xxii
showing
how
the
countersign
was
respected
at
the
bastile
fouquet
tore
along
as
fast
as
his
horses
could
drag
him
on
his
way
he
trembled
with
horror
at
the
idea
of
what
had
just
been
revealed
to
him
what
must
have
been
he
thought
the
youth
of
those
extraordinary
men
who
even
as
age
is
stealing
fast
upon
them
are
still
able
to
conceive
such
gigantic
plans
and
carry
them
through
without
a
tremor
at
one
moment
he
could
not
resist
the
idea
that
all
aramis
had
just
been
recounting
to
him
was
nothing
more
than
a
dream
and
whether
the
fable
itself
was
not
the
snare
so
that
when
fouquet
arrived
at
the
bastile
he
might
possibly
find
an
order
of
arrest
which
would
send
him
to
join
the
dethroned
king
strongly
impressed
with
this
idea
he
gave
certain
sealed
orders
on
his
route
while
fresh
horses
were
being
harnessed
to
his
carriage
these
orders
were
addressed
to
m
dartagnan
and
to
certain
others
whose
fidelity
to
the
king
was
far
above
suspicion
in
this
way
said
fouquet
to
himself
prisoner
or
not
i
shall
have
performed
the
duty
that
i
owe
my
honor
the
orders
will
not
reach
them
until
after
my
return
if
i
should
return
free
and
consequently
they
will
not
have
been
unsealed
i
shall
take
them
back
again
if
i
am
delayed
it
will
be
because
some
misfortune
will
have
befallen
me
and
in
that
case
assistance
will
be
sent
for
me
as
well
as
for
the
king
prepared
in
this
manner
the
superintendent
arrived
at
the
bastile
he
had
traveled
at
the
rate
of
five
leagues
and
a
half
the
hour
every
circumstance
of
delay
which
aramis
had
escaped
in
his
visit
to
the
bastile
befell
fouquet
it
was
useless
giving
his
name
equally
useless
his
being
recognized
he
could
not
succeed
in
obtaining
an
entrance
by
dint
of
entreaties
threats
commands
he
succeeded
in
inducing
a
sentinel
to
speak
to
one
of
the
subalterns
who
went
and
told
the
major
as
for
the
governor
they
did
not
even
dare
disturb
him
fouquet
sat
in
his
carriage
at
the
outer
gate
of
the
fortress
chafing
with
rage
and
impatience
awaiting
the
return
of
the
officers
who
at
last
reappeared
with
a
sufficiently
sulky
air
well
said
fouquet
impatiently
what
did
the
major
say
well
monsieur
replied
the
soldier
the
major
laughed
in
my
face
he
told
me
that
m
fouquet
was
at
vaux
and
that
even
were
he
at
paris
m
fouquet
would
not
get
up
at
so
early
an
hour
as
the
present
mordieu
you
are
an
absolute
set
of
fools
cried
the
minister
darting
out
of
the
carriage
and
before
the
subaltern
had
time
to
shut
the
gate
fouquet
sprang
through
it
and
ran
forward
in
spite
of
the
soldier
who
cried
out
for
assistance
fouquet
gained
ground
regardless
of
the
cries
of
the
man
who
however
having
at
last
come
up
with
fouquet
called
out
to
the
sentinel
of
the
second
gate
look
out
look
out
sentinel
the
man
crossed
his
pike
before
the
minister
but
the
latter
robust
and
active
and
hurried
away
too
by
his
passion
wrested
the
pike
from
the
soldier
and
struck
him
a
violent
blow
on
the
shoulder
with
it
the
subaltern
who
approached
too
closely
received
a
share
of
the
blows
as
well
both
of
them
uttered
loud
and
furious
cries
at
the
sound
of
which
the
whole
of
the
first
body
of
the
advanced
guard
poured
out
of
the
guardhouse
among
them
there
was
one
however
who
recognized
the
superintendent
and
who
called
monseigneur
ah
monseigneur
stop
stop
you
fellows
and
he
effectually
checked
the
soldiers
who
were
on
the
point
of
revenging
their
companions
fouquet
desired
them
to
open
the
gate
but
they
refused
to
do
so
without
the
countersign
he
desired
them
to
inform
the
governor
of
his
presence
but
the
latter
had
already
heard
the
disturbance
at
the
gate
he
ran
forward
followed
by
his
major
and
accompanied
by
a
picket
of
twenty
men
persuaded
that
an
attack
was
being
made
on
the
bastile
baisemeaux
also
recognized
fouquet
immediately
and
dropped
the
sword
he
bravely
had
been
brandishing
ah
monseigneur
he
stammered
how
can
i
excuse
monsieur
said
the
superintendent
flushed
with
anger
and
heated
by
his
exertions
i
congratulate
you
your
watch
and
ward
are
admirably
kept
baisemeaux
turned
pale
thinking
that
this
remark
was
made
ironically
and
portended
a
furious
burst
of
anger
but
fouquet
had
recovered
his
breath
and
beckoning
the
sentinel
and
the
subaltern
who
were
rubbing
their
shoulders
towards
him
he
said
there
are
twenty
pistoles
for
the
sentinel
and
fifty
for
the
officer
pray
receive
my
compliments
gentlemen
i
will
not
fail
to
speak
to
his
majesty
about
you
and
now
m
baisemeaux
a
word
with
you
and
he
followed
the
governor
to
his
official
residence
accompanied
by
a
murmur
of
general
satisfaction
baisemeaux
was
already
trembling
with
shame
and
uneasiness
aramiss
early
visit
from
that
moment
seemed
to
possess
consequences
which
a
functionary
such
as
he
baisemeaux
was
was
perfectly
justified
in
apprehending
it
was
quite
another
thing
however
when
fouquet
in
a
sharp
tone
of
voice
and
with
an
imperious
look
said
you
have
seen
m
dherblay
this
morning
yes
monseigneur
and
are
you
not
horrified
at
the
crime
of
which
you
have
made
yourself
an
accomplice
well
thought
baisemeaux
good
so
far
and
then
he
added
aloud
but
what
crime
monseigneur
do
you
allude
to
that
for
which
you
can
be
quartered
alive
monsieurdo
not
forget
that
but
this
is
not
a
time
to
show
anger
conduct
me
immediately
to
the
prisoner
to
what
prisoner
said
baisemeaux
trembling
you
pretend
to
be
ignorant
very
goodit
is
the
best
plan
for
you
perhaps
for
if
in
fact
you
were
to
admit
your
participation
in
such
a
crime
it
would
be
all
over
with
you
i
wish
therefore
to
seem
to
believe
in
your
assumption
of
ignorance
i
entreat
you
monseigneur
that
will
do
lead
me
to
the
prisoner
to
marchiali
who
is
marchiali
the
prisoner
who
was
brought
back
this
morning
by
m
dherblay
he
is
called
marchiali
said
the
superintendent
his
conviction
somewhat
shaken
by
baisemeauxs
cool
manner
yes
monseigneur
that
is
the
name
under
which
he
was
inscribed
here
fouquet
looked
steadily
at
baisemeaux
as
if
he
would
read
his
very
heart
and
perceived
with
that
clearsightedness
most
men
possess
who
are
accustomed
to
the
exercise
of
power
that
the
man
was
speaking
with
perfect
sincerity
besides
in
observing
his
face
for
a
few
moments
he
could
not
believe
that
aramis
would
have
chosen
such
a
confidant
it
is
the
prisoner
said
the
superintendent
to
him
whom
m
dherblay
carried
away
the
day
before
yesterday
yes
monseigneur
and
whom
he
brought
back
this
morning
added
fouquet
quickly
for
he
understood
immediately
the
mechanism
of
aramiss
plan
precisely
monseigneur
and
his
name
is
marchiali
you
say
yes
marchiali
if
monseigneur
has
come
here
to
remove
him
so
much
the
better
for
i
was
going
to
write
about
him
what
has
he
done
then
ever
since
this
morning
he
has
annoyed
me
extremely
he
has
had
such
terrible
fits
of
passion
as
almost
to
make
me
believe
that
he
would
bring
the
bastile
itself
down
about
our
ears
i
will
soon
relieve
you
of
his
possession
said
fouquet
ah
so
much
the
better
conduct
me
to
his
prison
will
monseigneur
give
me
the
order
what
order
an
order
from
the
king
wait
until
i
sign
you
one
that
will
not
be
sufficient
monseigneur
i
must
have
an
order
from
the
king
fouquet
assumed
an
irritated
expression
as
you
are
so
scrupulous
he
said
with
regard
to
allowing
prisoners
to
leave
show
me
the
order
by
which
this
one
was
set
at
liberty
baisemeaux
showed
him
the
order
to
release
seldon
very
good
said
fouquet
but
seldon
is
not
marchiali
but
marchiali
is
not
at
liberty
monseigneur
he
is
here
but
you
said
that
m
dherblay
carried
him
away
and
brought
him
back
again
i
did
not
say
so
so
surely
did
you
say
it
that
i
almost
seem
to
hear
it
now
it
was
a
slip
of
my
tongue
then
monseigneur
take
care
m
baisemeaux
take
care
i
have
nothing
to
fear
monseigneur
i
am
acting
according
to
the
very
strictest
regulation
do
you
dare
to
say
so
i
would
say
so
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
apostles
m
dherblay
brought
me
an
order
to
set
seldon
at
liberty
seldon
is
free
i
tell
you
that
marchiali
has
left
the
bastile
you
must
prove
that
monseigneur
let
me
see
him
you
monseigneur
who
govern
this
kingdom
know
very
well
that
no
one
can
see
any
of
the
prisoners
without
an
express
order
from
the
king
m
dherblay
has
entered
however
that
remains
to
be
proved
monseigneur
m
de
baisemeaux
once
more
i
warn
you
to
pay
particular
attention
to
what
you
are
saying
all
the
documents
are
there
monseigneur
m
dherblay
is
overthrown
overthrownm
dherblay
impossible
you
see
that
he
has
undoubtedly
influenced
you
no
monseigneur
what
does
in
fact
influence
me
is
the
kings
service
i
am
doing
my
duty
give
me
an
order
from
him
and
you
shall
enter
stay
m
le
gouverneur
i
give
you
my
word
that
if
you
allow
me
to
see
the
prisoner
i
will
give
you
an
order
from
the
king
at
once
give
it
to
me
now
monseigneur
and
that
if
you
refuse
me
i
will
have
you
and
all
your
officers
arrested
on
the
spot
before
you
commit
such
an
act
of
violence
monseigneur
you
will
reflect
said
baisemeaux
who
had
turned
very
pale
that
we
will
only
obey
an
order
signed
by
the
king
and
that
it
will
be
just
as
easy
for
you
to
obtain
one
to
see
marchiali
as
to
obtain
one
to
do
me
so
much
injury
me
too
who
am
perfectly
innocent
true
true
cried
fouquet
furiously
perfectly
true
m
de
baisemeaux
he
added
in
a
sonorous
voice
drawing
the
unhappy
governor
towards
him
do
you
know
why
i
am
so
anxious
to
speak
to
the
prisoner
no
monseigneur
and
allow
me
to
observe
that
you
are
terrifying
me
out
of
my
senses
i
am
trembling
all
overin
fact
i
feel
as
though
i
were
about
to
faint
you
will
stand
a
better
chance
of
fainting
outright
monsieur
baisemeaux
when
i
return
here
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
men
and
thirty
pieces
of
cannon
good
heavens
monseigneur
you
are
losing
your
senses
when
i
have
roused
the
whole
population
of
paris
against
you
and
your
accursed
towers
and
have
battered
open
the
gates
of
this
place
and
hanged
you
to
the
topmost
tree
of
yonder
pinnacle
monseigneur
monseigneur
for
pitys
sake
i
give
you
ten
minutes
to
make
up
your
mind
added
fouquet
in
a
calm
voice
i
will
sit
down
here
in
this
armchair
and
wait
for
you
if
in
ten
minutes
time
you
still
persist
i
leave
this
place
and
you
may
think
me
as
mad
as
you
like
thenyou
shall
see
baisemeaux
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
like
a
man
in
a
state
of
despair
but
he
did
not
reply
a
single
syllable
whereupon
fouquet
seized
a
pen
and
ink
and
wrote
order
for
m
le
prevot
des
marchands
to
assemble
the
municipal
guard
and
to
march
upon

baisemeaux
shrugged
his
shoulders
fouquet
wrote
order
for
the

to

cried
baisemeaux
i
do
not
understand
a

of
the
whole
matter
but
so
many
misfortunes

were

itself
that
had
set
them
at

awful
work

happen
here
in

couple
of
hours
that
the

must
be
judged

see
whether

wrong
in
withdrawing

with

monseigneur
you
shall
see

fouquet
darted
out
of
the
room
followed
by
baisemeaux
as
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
what
a
terrible
morning
he
said
what
a
disgrace
for
me
walk
faster
replied
fouquet
baisemeaux
made
a
sign
to
the
jailer
to
precede
them
he
was
afraid
of
his
companion
which
the
latter
could
not
fail
to
perceive
a
truce
to
this
childs
play
he
said
roughly
let
the
man
remain
here
take
the
keys
yourself
and
show
me
the
way
not
a
single
person
do
you
understand
must
hear
what
is
going
to
take
place
here
ah
said
baisemeaux
undecided
again
cried
m
fouquet
ah
say
no
at
once
and
i
will
leave
the
bastile
and
will
myself
carry
my
own
dispatches
baisemeaux
bowed
his
head
took
the
keys
and
unaccompanied
except
by
the
minister
ascended
the
staircase
the
higher
they
advanced
up
the
spiral
staircase
the
more
clearly
did
certain
muffled
murmurs
become
distinct
appeals
and
fearful
imprecations
what
is
that
asked
fouquet
that
is
your
marchiali
said
the
governor
this
is
the
way
these
madmen
scream
and
he
accompanied
that
reply
with
a
glance
more
pregnant
with
injurious
allusion
as
far
as
fouquet
was
concerned
than
politeness
the
latter
trembled
he
had
just
recognized
in
one
cry
more
terrible
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
the
kings
voice
he
paused
on
the
staircase
snatching
the
bunch
of
keys
from
baisemeaux
who
thought
this
new
madman
was
going
to
dash
out
his
brains
with
one
of
them
ah
he
cried
m
dherblay
did
not
say
a
word
about
that
give
me
the
keys
at
once
cried
fouquet
tearing
them
from
his
hand
which
is
the
key
of
the
door
i
am
to
open
that
one
a
fearful
cry
followed
by
a
violent
blow
against
the
door
made
the
whole
staircase
resound
with
the
echo
leave
this
place
said
fouquet
to
baisemeaux
in
a
threatening
tone
i
ask
nothing
better
murmured
the
latter
to
himself
there
will
be
a
couple
of
madmen
face
to
face
and
the
one
will
kill
the
other
i
am
sure
go
repeated
fouquet
if
you
place
your
foot
on
this
staircase
before
i
call
you
remember
that
you
shall
take
the
place
of
the
meanest
prisoner
in
the
bastile
this
job
will
kill
me
i
am
sure
it
will
muttered
baisemeaux
as
he
withdrew
with
tottering
steps
the
prisoners
cries
became
more
and
more
terrible
when
fouquet
had
satisfied
himself
that
baisemeaux
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
he
inserted
the
key
in
the
first
lock
it
was
then
that
he
heard
the
hoarse
choking
voice
of
the
king
crying
out
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
help
help
i
am
the
king
the
key
of
the
second
door
was
not
the
same
as
the
first
and
fouquet
was
obliged
to
look
for
it
on
the
bunch
the
king
however
furious
and
almost
mad
with
rage
and
passion
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
was
m
fouquet
who
brought
me
here
help
me
against
m
fouquet
i
am
the
king
help
the
king
against
m
fouquet
these
cries
filled
the
ministers
heart
with
terrible
emotions
they
were
followed
by
a
shower
of
blows
leveled
against
the
door
with
a
part
of
the
broken
chair
with
which
the
king
had
armed
himself
fouquet
at
last
succeeded
in
finding
the
key
the
king
was
almost
exhausted
he
could
hardly
articulate
distinctly
as
he
shouted
death
to
fouquet
death
to
the
traitor

the
two
men
were
on
the
point
of
darting
towards
each
other
when
they
suddenly
and
abruptly
stopped
as
a
mutual
recognition
took
place
and
each
uttered
a
cry
of
horror

said
the
king
when
he
recognized
fouquet
the
king
in
this
state
murmured
the
minister
nothing
could
be
more
terrible
indeed
than
the
appearance
of
the
young
prince
at
the
moment
fouquet
had
surprised
him
his
clothes
were
in
tatters
his
shirt
open
and
torn
to
rags
was
stained
with
sweat
and
with
the
blood
which
streamed
from
his
lacerated
breast
and
arms
haggard

his

masses
louis

presented
the
most
perfect
picture
of
despair
distress
anger
and
fear
combined
that
could
possibly
be
united
in
one
figure
fouquet
was
so
touched
so
affected
and
disturbed
by
it
that
he
ran
towards
him
with
his
arms
stretched
out
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
louis
held
up
the
massive
piece
of
wood
of
which
he
had
made
such
a
furious
use
sire
said
fouquet
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
do
you
not
recognize
the
most
faithful
of
your
friends
a
friendyou
repeated
louis
gnashing
his
teeth
in
a
manner
which
betrayed
his
hate
and
desire
for
speedy
vengeance
the
most
respectful
of
your
servants
added
fouquet
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
the
king
let
the
rude
weapon
fall
from
his
grasp
fouquet
approached
him
kissed
his
knees
and
took
him
in
his
arms
with
inconceivable
tenderness
my
king
my
child
he
said
how
you
must
have
suffered
louis
recalled
to
himself
by
the
change
of
situation
looked
at
himself
and
ashamed
of
the
disordered
state
of
his
apparel
ashamed
of
his
conduct
and
ashamed
of
the
air
of
pity
and
protection
that
was
shown
towards
him
drew
back
fouquet
did
not
understand
this
movement
he
did
not
perceive
that
the
kings
feeling
of
pride
would
never
forgive
him
for
having
been
a
witness
of
such
an
exhibition
of
weakness
come
sire
he
said
you
are
free
free
repeated
the
king
oh
you
set
me
at
liberty
then
after
having
dared
to
lift
up
your
hand
against
me
you
do
not
believe
that
exclaimed
fouquet
indignantly
you
cannot
believe
me
to
be
guilty
of
such
an
act
and
rapidly
warmly
even
he
related
the
whole
particulars
of
the
intrigue
the
details
of
which
are
already
known
to
the
reader
while
the
recital
continued
louis
suffered
the
most
horrible
anguish
of
mind
and
when
it
was
finished
the
magnitude
of
the
danger
he
had
run
struck
him
far
more
than
the
importance
of
the
secret
relative
to
his
twin
brother
monsieur
he
said
suddenly
to
fouquet
this
double
birth
is
a
falsehood
it
is
impossibleyou
cannot
have
been
the
dupe
of
it
sire
it
is
impossible
i
tell
you
that
the
honor
the
virtue
of
my
mother
can
be
suspected
and
my
first
minister
has
not
yet
done
justice
on
the
criminals
reflect
sire
before
you
are
hurried
away
by
anger
replied
fouquet
the
birth
of
your
brother
i
have
only
one
brotherand
that
is
monsieur
you
know
it
as
well
as
myself
there
is
a
plot
i
tell
you
beginning
with
the
governor
of
the
bastile
be
careful
sire
for
this
man
has
been
deceived
as
every
one
else
has
by
the
princes
likeness
to
yourself
likeness
absurd
this
marchiali
must
be
singularly
like
your
majesty
to
be
able
to
deceive
every
ones
eye
fouquet
persisted
ridiculous
do
not
say
so
sire
those
who
had
prepared
everything
in
order
to
face
and
deceive
your
ministers
your
mother
your
officers
of
state
the
members
of
your
family
must
be
quite
confident
of
the
resemblance
between
you
but
where
are
these
persons
then
murmured
the
king
at
vaux
at
vaux
and
you
suffer
them
to
remain
there
my
most
instant
duty
appeared
to
me
to
be
your
majestys
release
i
have
accomplished
that
duty
and
now
whatever
your
majesty
may
command
shall
be
done
i
await
your
orders
louis
reflected
for
a
few
moments
muster
all
the
troops
in
paris
he
said
all
the
necessary
orders
are
given
for
that
purpose
replied
fouquet
you
have
given
orders
exclaimed
the
king
for
that
purpose
yes
sire
your
majesty
will
be
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
men
in
less
than
an
hour
the
only
reply
the
king
made
was
to
take
hold
of
fouquets
hand
with
such
an
expression
of
feeling
that
it
was
very
easy
to
perceive
how
strongly
he
had
until
that
remark
maintained
his
suspicions
of
the
minister
notwithstanding
the
latters
intervention
and
with
these
troops
he
said
we
shall
go
at
once
and
besiege
in
your
house
the
rebels
who
by
this
time
will
have
established
and
intrenched
themselves
therein
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
were
the
case
replied
fouquet
why
because
their
chiefthe
very
soul
of
the
enterprisehaving
been
unmasked
by
me
the
whole
plan
seems
to
me
to
have
miscarried
you
have
unmasked
this
false
prince
also
no
i
have
not
seen
him
whom
have
you
seen
then
the
leader
of
the
enterprise
not
that
unhappy
young
man
the
latter
is
merely
an
instrument
destined
through
his
whole
life
to
wretchedness

your
friend
he
was
my
friend
sire
replied
fouquet
nobly
an
unfortunate
circumstance
for
you
said
the
king
in
a
less
generous
tone
of
voice
such
friendships
sire
had
nothing
dishonorable
in
them
so
long
as
i
was
ignorant
of
the
crime
you
should
have
foreseen
it
if
i
am
guilty
i
place
myself
in
your
majestys
hands
ah
monsieur
fouquet
it
was
not
that
i
meant
returned
the
king
sorry
to
have
shown
the
bitterness
of
his
thought
in
such
a
manner
well
i
assure
you
that
notwithstanding
the
mask
with
which
the
villain
covered
his
face
i
had
something
like
a
vague
suspicion
that
he
was
the
very
man
but
with
this
chief
of
the
enterprise
there
was
a
man
of
prodigious
strength
the
one
who
menaced
me
with
a
force
almost
herculean
what
is
he
it
must
be

friend

the
friend
of

the
friend
of

comte

ah
exclaimed
the
king
as
he
paused
at
the
name
of
the
latter
we
must
not
forget
the
connection
that
existed
between
the
conspirators

with
those

you

very
good
for

who
are
guilty

me
what
does
your
majesty
understand
by
that
inquired
fouquet
i
understand
replied
the
king
that
we
shall
soon
arrive
at
vaux
with
a
large
body
of
troops
that
we
will
lay
violent
hands
upon
that
nest
of
vipers
and
that
not
a
soul
shall
escape
your
majesty
will
put
these
men
to
death
cried
fouquet
to
the
very
meanest
of
them
oh
sire
let
us
understand
one
another
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
king
haughtily
we
no
longer
live
in
times
when
assassination
was
the
only
and
the
last
resource
kings
held
in
reservation
at
extremity
no
heaven
be
praised
i
have
parliaments
who
sit
and
judge
in
my
name
and
i
have
scaffolds
on
which
supreme
authority
is
carried
out
fouquet
turned
pale
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
observing
to
your
majesty
that
any
proceedings
instituted
respecting
these
matters
would
bring
down
the
greatest
scandal
upon
the
dignity
of
the
throne
the
august
name
of
anne
of
austria
must
never
be
allowed
to
pass
the
lips
of
the
people
accompanied
by
a
smile
justice
must
be
done
however
monsieur
good
sire
but
royal
blood
must
not
be
shed
upon
a
scaffold
the
royal
blood
you
believe
that
cried
the
king
with
fury
in
his
voice
stamping
his
foot
on
the
ground
this
double
birth
is
an
invention
and
in
that
invention
particularly
do
i
see
m
dherblays
crime
it
is
the
crime
i
wish
to
punish
rather
than
the
violence
or
the
insult
and
punish
it
with
death
sire
with
death
yes
monsieur
i
have
said
it
sire
said
the
surintendant
with
firmness
as
he
raised
his
head
proudly
your
majesty
will
take
the
life
if
you
please
of
your
brother
philippe
of
france
that
concerns
you
alone
and
you
will
doubtless
consult
the
queenmother
upon
the
subject
whatever
she
may
command
will
be
perfectly
correct
i
do
not
wish
to
mix
myself
up
in
it
not
even
for
the
honor
of
your
crown
but
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
and
i
beg
to
submit
it
to
you
speak
said
the
king
in
no
little
degree
agitated
by
his
ministers
last
words
what
do
you
require
the
pardon
of
m
dherblay
and
of
m
du
vallon
my
assassins
two
rebels
sire
that
is
all
oh
i
understand
then
you
ask
me
to
forgive
your
friends
my
friends
said
fouquet
deeply
wounded
your
friends
certainly
but
the
safety
of
the
state
requires
that
an
exemplary
punishment
should
be
inflicted
on
the
guilty
i
will
not
permit
myself
to
remind
your
majesty
that
i
have
just
restored
you
to
liberty
and
have
saved
your
life
monsieur
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
remind
your
majesty
that
had
m
dherblay
wished
to
carry
out
his
character
of
an
assassin
he
could
very
easily
have
assassinated
your
majesty
this
morning
in
the
forest
of
senart
and
all
would
have
been
over
the
king
started
a
pistolbullet
through
the
head
pursued
fouquet
and
the
disfigured
features
of
louis
xiv
which
no
one
could
have
recognized
would
be
m
dherblays
complete
and
entire
justification
the
king
turned
pale
and
giddy
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
danger
he
had
escaped
if
m
dherblay
continued
fouquet
had
been
an
assassin
he
had
no
occasion
to
inform
me
of
his
plan
in
order
to
succeed
freed
from
the
real
king
it
would
have
been
impossible
in
all
futurity
to
guess
the
false
and
if
the
usurper
had
been
recognized
by
anne
of
austria
he
would
still
have
beenher
son
the
usurper
as
far
as
monsieur
dherblays
conscience
was
concerned
was
still
a
king
of
the
blood
of
louis
xiii
moreover
the
conspirator
in
that
course
would
have
had
security
secrecy
impunity
a
pistolbullet
would
have
procured
him
all
that
for
the
sake
of
heaven
sire
grant
me
his
forgiveness
the
king
instead
of
being
touched
by
the
picture
so
faithfully
drawn
in
all
details
of
aramiss
generosity
felt
himself
most
painfully
and
cruelly
humiliated
his
unconquerable
pride
revolted
at
the
idea
that
a
man
had
held
suspended
at
the
end
of
his
finger
the
thread
of
his
royal
life
every
word
that
fell
from
fouquets
lips
and
which
he
thought
most
efficacious
in
procuring
his
friends
pardon
seemed
to
pour
another
drop
of
poison
into
the
already
ulcerated
heart
of
louis
xiv
nothing
could
bend
or
soften
him
addressing
himself
to
fouquet
he
said
i
really
dont
know
monsieur
why
you
should
solicit
the
pardon
of
these
men
what
good
is
there
in
asking
that
which
can
be
obtained
without
solicitation
i
do
not
understand
you
sire
it
is
not
difficult
either
where
am
i
now
in
the
bastile
sire
yes
in
a
dungeon
i
am
looked
upon
as
a
madman
am
i
not
yes
sire
and
no
one
is
known
here
but
marchiali
certainly
well
change
nothing
in
the
position
of
affairs
let
the
poor
madman
rot
between
the
slimy
walls
of
the
bastile
and
m
dherblay
and
m
du
vallon
will
stand
in
no
need
of
my
forgiveness
their
new
king
will
absolve
them
your
majesty
does
me
a
great
injustice
sire
and
you
are
wrong
replied
fouquet
dryly
i
am
not
child
enough
nor
is
m
dherblay
silly
enough
to
have
omitted
to
make
all
these
reflections
and
if
i
had
wished
to
make
a
new
king
as
you
say
i
had
no
occasion
to
have
come
here
to
force
open
the
gates
and
doors
of
the
bastile
to
free
you
from
this
place
that
would
show
a
want
of
even
common
sense
your
majestys
mind
is
disturbed
by
anger
otherwise
you
would
be
far
from
offending
groundlessly
the
very
one
of
your
servants
who
has
rendered
you
the
most
important
service
of
all
louis
perceived
that
he
had
gone
too
far
that
the
gates
of
the
bastile
were
still
closed
upon
him
whilst
by
degrees
the
floodgates
were
gradually
being
opened
behind
which
the
generoushearted
fouquet
had
restrained
his
anger
i
did
not
say
that
to
humiliate
you
heaven
knows
monsieur
he
replied
only
you
are
addressing
yourself
to
me
in
order
to
obtain
a
pardon
and
i
answer
according
to
my
conscience
and
so
judging
by
my
conscience
the
criminals
we
speak
of
are
not
worthy
of
consideration
or
forgiveness
fouquet
was
silent
what
i
do
is
as
generous
added
the
king
as
what
you
have
done
for
i
am
in
your
power
i
will
even
say
it
is
more
generous
inasmuch
as
you
place
before
me
certain
conditions
upon
which
my
liberty
my
life
may
depend
and
to
reject
which
is
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
both
i
was
wrong
certainly
replied
fouquet
yesi
had
the
appearance
of
extorting
a
favor
i
regret
it
and
entreat
your
majestys
forgiveness
and
you
are
forgiven
my
dear
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
king
with
a
smile
which
restored
the
serene
expression
of
his
features
which
so
many
circumstances
had
altered
since
the
preceding
evening
i
have
my
own
forgiveness
replied
the
minister
with
some
degree
of
persistence
but
m
dherblay
and
m
du
vallon
they
will
never
obtain
theirs
as
long
as
i
live
replied
the
inflexible
king
do
me
the
kindness
not
to
speak
of
it
again
your
majesty
shall
be
obeyed
and
you
will
bear
me
no
illwill
for
it
oh
no
sire
for
i
anticipated
the
event
you
had
anticipated
that
i
should
refuse
to
forgive
those
gentlemen
certainly
and
all
my
measures
were
taken
in
consequence
what
do
you
mean
to
say
cried
the
king
surprised
m
dherblay
came
as
may
be
said
to
deliver
himself
into
my
hands
m
dherblay
left
to
me
the
happiness
of
saving
my
king
and
my
country
i
could
not
condemn
m
dherblay
to
death
nor
could
i
on
the
other
hand
expose
him
to
your
majestys
justifiable
wrath
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
as
if
i
had
killed
him
myself
well
and
what
have
you
done
sire
i
gave
m
dherblay
the
best
horses
in
my
stables
and
four
hours
start
over
all
those
your
majesty
might
probably
dispatch
after
him
be
it
so
murmured
the
king
but
still
the
world
is
wide
enough
and
large
enough
for
those
whom
i
may
send
to
overtake
your
horses
notwithstanding
the
four
hours
start
which
you
have
given
to
m
dherblay
in
giving
him
these
four
hours
sire
i
knew
i
was
giving
him
his
life
and
he
will
save
his
life
in
what
way
after
having
galloped
as
hard
as
possible
with
the
four
hours
start
before
your
musketeers
he
will
reach
my
chateau
of
belleisle
where
i
have
given
him
a
safe
asylum
that
may
be
but
you
forget
that
you
have
made
me
a
present
of
belleisle
but
not
for
you
to
arrest
my
friends
you
take
it
back
again
then
as
far
as
that
goesyes
sire
my
musketeers
shall
capture
it
and
the
affair
will
be
at
an
end
neither
your
musketeers
nor
your
whole
army
could
take
belleisle
said
fouquet
coldly
belleisle
is
impregnable
the
king
became
perfectly
livid
a
lightning
flash
seemed
to
dart
from
his
eyes
fouquet
felt
that
he
was
lost
but
he
as
not
one
to
shrink
when
the
voice
of
honor
spoke
loudly
within
him
he
bore
the
kings
wrathful
gaze
the
latter
swallowed
his
rage
and
after
a
few
moments
silence
said
are
we
going
to
return
to
vaux
i
am
at
your
majestys
orders
replied
fouquet
with
a
low
bow
but
i
think
that
your
majesty
can
hardly
dispense
with
changing
your
clothes
previous
to
appearing
before
your
court
we
shall
pass
by
the
louvre
said
the
king
come
and
they
left
the
prison
passing
before
baisemeaux
who
looked
completely
bewildered
as
he
saw
marchiali
once
more
leave
and
in
his
helplessness
tore
out
the
major
portion
of
his
few
remaining
hairs
it
was
perfectly
true
however
that
fouquet
wrote
and
gave
him
an
authority
for
the
prisoners
release
and
that
the
king
wrote
beneath
it
seen
and
approved
louis
a
piece
of
madness
that
baisemeaux
incapable
of
putting
two
ideas
together
acknowledged
by
giving
himself
a
terrible
blow
on
the
forehead

the
false
king
in

usurped
royalty

playing
out
its
part
bravely
at

philippe
gave
orders
that
for
his
petit
lever
the
grandes
entrees
already
prepared
to
appear
before
the
king
should
be
introduced
he
determined
to
give
this
order
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
m
dherblay
who
did
not
returnour
readers
know
the
reason
but
the
prince
not
believing
that
absence
could
be
prolonged
wished
as
all
rash
spirits
do
to
try
his
valor
and
his
fortune

from
all
protection
and
instruction

the
guilty
mother
was
about
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
her
sacrificed
son
philippe
was
not
willing
if
he
had
a
weakness
to
render
the
man
a
witness
of
it
before
whom
he
was
bound
thenceforth
to
display
so
much
strength
philippe
opened
his
folding
doors
and
several
persons
entered
silently
philippe
did
not
stir
whilst
his
valets
de
chambre
dressed
him
he
had
watched
the
evening
before
all
the
habits
of
his
brother
and
played
the
king
in
such
a
manner
as
to
awaken
no
suspicion
he
was
thus
completely
dressed
in
hunting
costume
when
he
received
his
visitors
his
own
memory
and
the
notes
of
aramis
announced
everybody
to
him
first
of
all
anne
of
austria
to
whom
monsieur
gave
his
hand
and
then
madame
with
m
de
saintaignan
he
smiled
at
seeing
these
countenances
but
trembled
on
recognizing
his
mother
that
still
so
noble
and
imposing
figure
ravaged
by
pain
pleaded
in
his
heart
the
cause
of
the
famous
queen
who
had
immolated
a
child
to
reasons
of
state
he
found
his
mother
still
handsome
he
knew
that
louis
xiv
loved
her
and
he
promised
himself
to
love
her
likewise
and
not
to
prove
a
scourge
to
her
old
age
he
contemplated
his
brother
with
a
tenderness
easily
to
be
understood
the
latter
had
usurped
nothing
had
cast
no
shades
athwart
his
life
a
separate
tree
he
allowed
the
stem
to
rise
without
heeding
its
elevation
or
majestic
life
philippe
promised
himself
to
be
a
kind
brother
to
this
prince
who
required
nothing
but
gold
to
minister
to
his
pleasures
he
bowed
with
a
friendly
air
to
saintaignan
who
was
all
reverences
and
smiles
and
trembling
held
out
his
hand
to
henrietta
his
sisterinlaw
whose
beauty
struck
him
but
he
saw
in
the
eyes
of
that
princess
an
expression
of
coldness
which
would
facilitate
as
he
thought
their
future
relations
how
much
more
easy
thought
he
it
will
be
to
be
the
brother
of
that
woman
than
her
gallant
if
she
evinces
towards
me
a
coldness
that
my
brother
could
not
have
for
her
but
which
is
imposed
upon
me
as
a
duty
the
only
visit
he
dreaded
at
this
moment
was
that
of
the
queen
his
hearthis
mindhad
just
been
shaken
by
so
violent
a
trial
that
in
spite
of
their
firm
temperament
they
would
not
perhaps
support
another
shock
happily
the
queen
did
not
come
then
commenced
on
the
part
of
anne
of
austria
a
political
dissertation
upon
the
welcome
m
fouquet
had
given
to
the
house
of
france
she
mixed
up
hostilities
with
compliments
addressed
to
the
king
and
questions
as
to
his
health
with
little
maternal
flatteries
and
diplomatic
artifices
well
my
son
said
she
are
you
convinced
with
regard
to
m
fouquet
saintaignan
said
philippe
have
the
goodness
to
go
and
inquire
after
the
queen
at
these
words
the
first
philippe
had
pronounced
aloud
the
slight
difference
that
there
was
between
his
voice
and
that
of
the
king
was
sensible
to
maternal
ears
and
anne
of
austria
looked
earnestly
at
her
son
saintaignan
left
the
room
and
philippe
continued
madame
i
do
not
like
to
hear
m
fouquet
illspoken
of
you
know
i
do
notand
you
have
even
spoken
well
of
him
yourself
that
is
true
therefore
i
only
question
you
on
the
state
of
your
sentiments
with
respect
to
him
sire
said
henrietta
i
on
my
part
have
always
liked
m
fouquet
he
is
a
man
of
good
tastea
superior
man
a
superintendent
who
is
never
sordid
or
niggardly
added
monsieur
and
who
pays
in
gold
all
the
orders
i
have
on
him
every
one
in
this
thinks
too
much
of
himself
and
nobody
for
the
state
said
the
old
queen
m
fouquet
it
is
a
fact
m
fouquet
is
ruining
the
state
well
mother
replied
philippe
in
rather
a
lower
key
do
you
likewise
constitute
yourself
the
buckler
of
m
colbert
how
is
that
replied
the
old
queen
rather
surprised
why
in
truth
replied
philippe
you
speak
that
just
as
your
old
friend
madame
de
chevreuse
would
speak
why
do
you
mention
madame
de
chevreuse
to
me
said
she
and
what
sort
of
humor
are
you
in
today
towards
me
philippe
continued
is
not
madame
de
chevreuse
always
in
league
against
somebody
has
not
madame
de
chevreuse
been
to
pay
you
a
visit
mother
monsieur
you
speak
to
me
now
in
such
a
manner
that
i
can
almost
fancy
i
am
listening
to
your
father
my
father
did
not
like
madame
de
chevreuse
and
had
good
reason
for
not
liking
her
said
the
prince
for
my
part
i
like
her
no
better
than
he
did
and
if
she
thinks
proper
to
come
here
as
she
formerly
did
to
sow
divisions
and
hatreds
under
the
pretext
of
begging
moneywhy
well
what
said
anne
of
austria
proudly
herself
provoking
the
storm
well
replied
the
young
man
firmly
i
will
drive
madame
de
chevreuse
out
of
my
kingdomand
with
her
all
who
meddle
with
its
secrets
and
mysteries
he
had
not
calculated
the
effect
of
this
terrible
speech
or
perhaps
he
wished
to
judge
the
effect
of
it
like
those
who
suffering
from
a
chronic
pain
and
seeking
to
break
the
monotony
of
that
suffering
touch
their
wound
to
procure
a
sharper
pang
anne
of
austria
was
nearly
fainting
her
eyes
open
but
meaningless
ceased
to
see
for
several
seconds
she
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
her
other
son
who
supported
and
embraced
her
without
fear
of
irritating
the
king
sire
murmured
she
you
are
treating
your
mother
very
cruelly
in
what
respect
madame
replied
he
i
am
only
speaking
of
madame
de
chevreuse
does
my
mother
prefer
madame
de
chevreuse
to
the
security
of
the
state
and
of
my
person
well
then
madame
i
tell
you
madame
de
chevreuse
has
returned
to
france
to
borrow
money
and
that
she
addressed
herself
to
m
fouquet
to
sell
him
a
certain
secret
a
certain
secret
cried
anne
of
austria
concerning
pretended
robberies
that
monsieur
le
surintendant
had
committed
which
is
false
added
philippe
m
fouquet
rejected
her
offers
with
indignation
preferring
the
esteem
of
the
king
to
complicity
with
such
intriguers
then
madame
de
chevreuse
sold
the
secret
to
m
colbert
and
as
she
is
insatiable
and
was
not
satisfied
with
having
extorted
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
from
a
servant
of
the
state
she
has
taken
a
still
bolder
flight
in
search
of
surer
sources
of
supply
is
that
true
madame
you
know
all
sire
said
the
queen
more
uneasy
than
irritated
now
continued
philippe
i
have
good
reason
to
dislike
this
fury
who
comes
to
my
court
to
plan
the
shame
of
some
and
the
ruin
of
others
if
heaven
has
suffered
certain
crimes
to
be
committed
and
has
concealed
them
in
the
shadow
of
its
clemency
i
will
not
permit
madame
de
chevreuse
to
counteract
the
just
designs
of
fate
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
had
so
agitated
the
queenmother
that
her
son
had
pity
on
her
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
tenderly
she
did
not
feel
that
in
that
kiss
given
in
spite
of
repulsion
and
bitterness
of
the
heart
there
was
a
pardon
for
eight
years
of
suffering
philippe
allowed
the
silence
of
a
moment
to
swallow
the
emotions
that
had
just
developed
themselves
then
with
a
cheerful
smile
we
will
not
go
today
said
he
i
have
a
plan
and
turning
towards
the
door
he
hoped
to
see
aramis
whose
absence
began
to
alarm
him
the
queenmother
wished
to
leave
the
room
remain
where
you
are
mother
said
he
i
wish
you
to
make
your
peace
with
m
fouquet
i
bear
m
fouquet
no
illwill
i
only
dreaded
his
prodigalities
we
will
put
that
to
rights
and
will
take
nothing
of
the
superintendent
but
his
good
qualities
what
is
your
majesty
looking
for
said
henrietta
seeing
the
kings
eyes
constantly
turned
towards
the
door
and
wishing
to
let
fly
a
little
poisoned
arrow
at
his
heart
supposing
he
was
so
anxiously
expecting
either
la
valliere
or
a
letter
from
her
my
sister
said
the
young
man
who
had
divined
her
thought
thanks
to
that
marvelous
perspicuity
of
which
fortune
was
from
that
time
about
to
allow
him
the
exercise
my
sister
i
am
expecting
a
most
distinguished
man
a
most
able
counselor
whom
i
wish
to
present
to
you
all
recommending
him
to
your
good
graces
ah
come
in
then
dartagnan
what
does
your
majesty
wish
said
dartagnan
appearing
where
is
monsieur
the
bishop
of
vannes
your
friend
why
sire
i
am
waiting
for
him
and
he
does
not
come
let
him
be
sought
for
dartagnan
remained
for
an
instant
stupefied
but
soon
reflecting
that
aramis
had
left
vaux
privately
on
a
mission
from
the
king
he
concluded
that
the
king
wished
to
preserve
the
secret
sire
replied
he
does
your
majesty
absolutely
require
m
dherblay
to
be
brought
to
you
absolutely
is
not
the
word
said
philippe
i
do
not
want
him
so
particularly
as
that
but
if
he
can
be
found
i
thought
so
said
dartagnan
to
himself
is
this
m
dherblay
the
bishop
of
vannes
yes
madame
a
friend
of
m
fouquet
yes
madame
an
old
musketeer
anne
of
austria
blushed
one
of
the
four
braves
who
formerly
performed
such
prodigies
the
old
queen
repented
of
having
wished
to
bite
she
broke
off
the
conversation
in
order
to
preserve
the
rest
of
her
teeth
whatever
may
be
your
choice
sire
said
she
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
excellent
all
bowed
in
support
of
that
sentiment
you
will
find
in
him
continued
philippe
the
depth
and
penetration
of
m
de
richelieu
without
the
avarice
of
m
de
mazarin
a
prime
minister
sire
said
monsieur
in
a
fright
i
will
tell
you
all
about
that
brother
but
it
is
strange
that
m
dherblay
is
not
here
he
called
out
let
m
fouquet
be
informed
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
himoh
before
you
before
you
do
not
retire
m
de
saintaignan
returned
bringing
satisfactory
news
of
the
queen
who
only
kept
her
bed
from
precaution
and
to
have
strength
to
carry
out
the
kings
wishes
whilst
everybody
was
seeking
m
fouquet
and
aramis
the
new
king
quietly
continued
his
experiments
and
everybody
family
officers
servants
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
his
identity
his
air
his
voice
and
manners
were
so
like
the
kings
on
his
side
philippe
applying
to
all
countenances
the
accurate
descriptions
and
keynotes
of
character
supplied
by
his
accomplice
aramis
conducted
himself
so
as
not
to
give
birth
to
a
doubt
in
the
minds
of
those
who
surrounded
him
nothing
from
that
time
could
disturb
the
usurper
with
what
strange
facility
had
providence
just
reversed
the
loftiest
fortune
of
the
world
to
substitute
the
lowliest
in
its
stead
philippe
admired
the
goodness
of
god
with
regard
to
himself
and
seconded
it
with
all
the
resources
of
his
admirable
nature
but
he
felt
at
times
something
like
a
specter
gliding
between
him
and
the
rays
of
his
new
glory
aramis
did
not
appear
the
conversation
had
languished
in
the
royal
family
philippe
preoccupied
forgot
to
dismiss
his
brother
and
madame
henrietta
the
latter
were
astonished
and
began
by
degrees
to
lose
all
patience
anne
of
austria
stooped
towards
her
sons
ear
and
addressed
some
words
to
him
in
spanish
philippe
was
completely
ignorant
of
that
language
and
grew
pale
at
this
unexpected
obstacle
but
as
if
the
spirit
of
the
imperturbable
aramis
had
covered
him
with
his
infallibility
instead
of
appearing
disconcerted
philippe
rose
well
what
said
anne
of
austria
what
is
all
that
noise
said
philippe
turning
round
towards
the
door
of
the
second
staircase
and
a
voice
was
heard
saying
this
way
this
way
a
few
steps
more
sire
the
voice
of
m
fouquet
said
dartagnan
who
was
standing
close
to
the
queenmother
then
m
dherblay
cannot
be
far
off
added
philippe
but
he
then
saw
what
he
little
thought
to
have
beheld
so
near
to
him
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
door
at
which
m
fouquet
was
expected
to
enter
but
it
was
not
m
fouquet
who
entered
a
terrible
cry
resounded
from
all
corners
of
the
chamber
a
painful
cry
uttered
by
the
king
and
all
present
it
is
given
to
but
few
men
even
those
whose
destiny
contains
the
strangest
elements
and
accidents
the
most
wonderful
to
contemplate
such
a
spectacle
similar
to
that
which
presented
itself
in
the
royal
chamber
at
that
moment
the
halfclosed
shutters
only
admitted
the
entrance
of
an
uncertain
light
passing
through
thick
violet
velvet
curtains
lined
with
silk
in
this
soft
shade
the
eyes
were
by
degrees
dilated
and
every
one
present
saw
others
rather
with
imagination
than
with
actual
sight
there
could
not
however
escape
in
these
circumstances
one
of
the
surrounding
details
and
the
new
object
which
presented
itself
appeared
as
luminous
as
though
it
shone
out
in
full
sunlight
so
it
happened
with
louis
xiv
when
he
showed
himself
pale
and
frowning
in
the
doorway
of
the
secret
stairs
the
face
of
fouquet
appeared
behind
him
stamped
with
sorrow
and
determination
the
queenmother
who
perceived
louis
xiv
and
who
held
the
hand
of
philippe
uttered
a
cry
of
which
we
have
spoken
as
if
she
beheld
a
phantom
monsieur
was
bewildered
and
kept
turning
his
head
in
astonishment
from
one
to
the
other
madame
made
a
step
forward
thinking
she
was
looking
at
the
form
of
her
brotherinlaw
reflected
in
a
mirror
and
in
fact
the
illusion
was
possible
the
two
princes
both
pale
as
deathfor
we
renounce
the
hope
of
being
able
to
describe
the
fearful
state
of
philippetrembling
clenching
their
hands
convulsively
measured
each
other
with
looks
and
darted
their
glances
sharp
as
poniards
at
each
other
silent
panting
bending
forward
they
appeared
as
if
about
to
spring
upon
an
enemy
the
unheardof
resemblance
of
countenance
gesture
shape
height
even
to
the
resemblance
of
costume
produced
by
chancefor
louis
xiv
had
been
to
the
louvre
and
put
on
a
violetcolored
dressthe
perfect
analogy
of
the
two
princes
completed
the
consternation
of
anne
of
austria
and
yet
she
did
not
at
once
guess
the
truth
there
are
misfortunes
in
life
so
truly
dreadful
that
no
one
will
at
first
accept
them
people
rather
believe
in
the
supernatural
and
the
impossible
louis
had
not
reckoned
on
these
obstacles
he
expected
that
he
had
only
to
appear
to
be
acknowledged
a
living
sun
he
could
not
endure
the
suspicion
of
equality
with
any
one
he
did
not
admit
that
every
torch
should
not
become
darkness
at
the
instant
he
shone
out
with
his
conquering
ray
at
the
aspect
of
philippe
then
he
was
perhaps
more
terrified
than
any
one
round
him
and
his
silence
his
immobility
were
this
time
a
concentration
and
a
calm
which
precede
the
violent
explosions
of
concentrated
passion
but
fouquet
who
shall
paint
his
emotion
and
stupor
in
presence
of
this
living
portrait
of
his
master
fouquet
thought
aramis
was
right
that
this
newlyarrived
was
a
king
as
pure
in
his
race
as
the
other
and
that
for
having
repudiated
all
participation
in
this
coup
detat
so
skillfully
got
up
by
the
general
of
the
jesuits
he
must
be
a
mad
enthusiast
unworthy
of
ever
dipping
his
hands
in
political
grand
strategy
work
and
then
it
was
the
blood
of
louis
xiii
which
fouquet
was
sacrificing
to
the
blood
of
louis
xiii
it
was
to
a
selfish
ambition
he
was
sacrificing
a
noble
ambition
to
the
right
of
keeping
he
sacrificed
the
right
of
having
the
whole
extent
of
his
fault
was
revealed
to
him
at
simple
sight
of
the
pretender
all
that
passed
in
the
mind
of
fouquet
was
lost
upon
the
persons
present
he
had
five
minutes
to
focus
meditation
on
this
point
of
conscience
five
minutes
that
is
to
say
five
ages
during
which
the
two
kings
and
their
family
scarcely
found
energy
to
breathe
after
so
terrible
a
shock
dartagnan
leaning
against
the
wall
in
front
of
fouquet
with
his
hand
to
his
brow
asked
himself
the
cause
of
such
a
wonderful
prodigy
he
could
not
have
said
at
once
why
he
doubted
but
he
knew
assuredly
that
he
had
reason
to
doubt
and
that
in
this
meeting
of
the
two
louis
xivs
lay
all
the
doubt
and
difficulty
that
during
late
days
had
rendered
the
conduct
of
aramis
so
suspicious
to
the
musketeer
these
ideas
were
however
enveloped
in
a
haze
a
veil
of
mystery
the
actors
in
this
assembly
seemed
to
swim
in
the
vapors
of
a
confused
waking
suddenly
louis
xiv
more
impatient
and
more
accustomed
to
command
ran
to
one
of
the
shutters
which
he
opened
tearing
the
curtains
in
his
eagerness
a
flood
of
living
light
entered
the
chamber
and
made
philippe
draw
back
to
the
alcove
louis
seized
upon
this
movement
with
eagerness
and
addressing
himself
to
the
queen
my
mother
said
he
do
you
not
acknowledge
your
son
since
every
one
here
has
forgotten
his
king
anne
of
austria
started
and
raised
her
arms
towards
heaven
without
being
able
to
articulate
a
single
word
my
mother
said
philippe
with
a
calm
voice
do
you
not
acknowledge
your
son
and
this
time
in
his
turn
louis
drew
back
as
to
anne
of
austria
struck
suddenly
in
head
and
heart
with
fell
remorse
she
lost
her
equilibrium
no
one
aiding
her
for
all
were
petrified
she
sank
back
in
her
fauteuil
breathing
a
weak
trembling
sigh
louis
could
not
endure
the
spectacle
and
the
affront
he
bounded
towards
dartagnan
over
whose
brain
a
vertigo
was
stealing
and
who
staggered
as
he
caught
at
the
door
for
support
a
moi
mousquetaire
said
he
look
us
in
the
face
and
say
which
is
the
paler
he
or
i
this
cry
roused
dartagnan
and
stirred
in
his
heart
the
fibers
of
obedience
he
shook
his
head
and
without
more
hesitation
he
walked
straight
up
to
philippe
on
whose
shoulder
he
laid
his
hand
saying
monsieur
you
are
my
prisoner
philippe
did
not
raise
his
eyes
towards
heaven
nor
stir
from
the
spot
where
he
seemed
nailed
to
the
floor
his
eye
intently
fixed
upon
the
king
his
brother
he
reproached
him
with
a
sublime
silence
for
all
misfortunes
past
all
tortures
to
come
against
this
language
of
the
soul
the
king
felt
he
had
no
power
he
cast
down
his
eyes
dragging
away
precipitately
his
brother
and
sister
forgetting
his
mother
sitting
motionless
within
three
paces
of
the
son
whom
she
left
a
second
time
to
be
condemned
to
death
philippe
approached
anne
of
austria
and
said
to
her
in
a
soft
and
nobly
agitated
voice
if
i
were
not
your
son
i
should
curse
you
my
mother
for
having
rendered
me
so
unhappy
dartagnan
felt
a
shudder
pass
through
the
marrow
of
his
bones
he
bowed
respectfully
to
the
young
prince
and
said
as
he
bent
excuse
me
monseigneur
i
am
but
a
soldier
and
my
oaths
are
his
who
has
just
left
the
chamber
thank
you
m
dartagnan
what
has
become
of
m
dherblay
m
dherblay
is
in
safety
monseigneur
said
a
voice
behind
them
and
no
one
while
i
live
and
am
free
shall
cause
a
hair
to
fall
from
his
head
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
prince
smiling
sadly
pardon
me
monseigneur
said
fouquet
kneeling
but
he
who
is
just
gone
out
from
hence
was
my
guest
here
are
murmured
philippe
with
a
sigh
brave
friends
and
good
hearts
they
make
me
regret
the
world
on
m
dartagnan
i
follow
you
at
the
moment
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
was
about
to
leave
the
room
with
his
prisoner
colbert
appeared
and
after
remitting
an
order
from
the
king
to
dartagnan
retired
dartagnan
read
the
paper
and
then
crushed
it
in
his
hand
with
rage
what
is
it
asked
the
prince
read
monseigneur
replied
the
musketeer
philippe
read
the
following
words
hastily
traced
by
the
hand
of
the
king
m
dartagnan
will
conduct
the
prisoner
to
the
ile
saintemarguerite
he
will
cover
his
face
with
an
iron
vizor
which
the
prisoner
shall
never
raise
except
at
peril
of
his
life
that
is
just
said
philippe
with
resignation
i
am
ready
aramis
was
right
said
fouquet
in
a
low
voice
to
the
musketeer
this
one
is
every
whit
as
much
a
king
as
the
other
more
so
replied
dartagnan
he
wanted
only
you
and
me
chapter
xxv
in
which
porthos
thinks
he
is
pursuing
a
duchy
aramis
and
porthos
having
profited
by
the
time
granted
them
by
fouquet
did
honor
to
the
french
cavalry
by
their
speed
porthos
did
not
clearly
understand
on
what
kind
of
mission
he
was
forced
to
display
so
much
velocity
but
as
he
saw
aramis
spurring
on
furiously
he
porthos
spurred
on
in
the
same
way
they
had
soon
in
this
manner
placed
twelve
leagues
between
them
and
vaux
they
were
then
obliged
to
change
horses
and
organize
a
sort
of
post
arrangement
it
was
during
a
relay
that
porthos
ventured
to
interrogate
aramis
discreetly
hush
replied
the
latter
know
only
that
our
fortune
depends
on
our
speed
as
if
porthos
had
still
been
the
musketeer
without
a
sou
or
a
maille
of
1626
he
pushed
forward
that
magic
word
fortune
always
means
something
in
the
human
ear
it
means
enough
for
those
who
have
nothing
it
means
too
much
for
those
who
have
enough
i
shall
be
made
a
duke
said
porthos
aloud
he
was
speaking
to
himself
that
is
possible
replied
aramis
smiling
after
his
own
fashion
as
porthoss
horse
passed
him
aramis
felt
notwithstanding
as
though
his
brain
were
on
fire
the
activity
of
the
body
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
subduing
that
of
the
mind
all
there
is
of
raging
passion
mental
toothache
or
mortal
threat
raged
gnawed
and
grumbled
in
the
thoughts
of
the
unhappy
prelate
his
countenance
exhibited
visible
traces
of
this
rude
combat
free
on
the
highway
to
abandon
himself
to
every
impression
of
the
moment
aramis
did
not
fail
to
swear
at
every
start
of
his
horse
at
every
inequality
in
the
road
pale
at
times
inundated
with
boiling
sweats
then
again
dry
and
icy
he
flogged
his
horses
till
the
blood
streamed
from
their
sides
porthos
whose
dominant
fault
was
not
sensibility
groaned
at
this
thus
traveled
they
on
for
eight
long
hours
and
then
arrived
at
orleans
it
was
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
aramis
on
observing
this
judged
that
nothing
showed
pursuit
to
be
a
possibility
it
would
be
without
example
that
a
troop
capable
of
taking
him
and
porthos
should
be
furnished
with
relays
sufficient
to
perform
forty
leagues
in
eight
hours
thus
admitting
pursuit
which
was
not
at
all
manifest
the
fugitives
were
five
hours
in
advance
of
their
pursuers
aramis
thought
that
there
might
be
no
imprudence
in
taking
a
little
rest
but
that
to
continue
would
make
the
matter
more
certain
twenty
leagues
more
performed
with
the
same
rapidity
twenty
more
leagues
devoured
and
no
one
not
even
dartagnan
could
overtake
the
enemies
of
the
king
aramis
felt
obliged
therefore
to
inflict
upon
porthos
the
pain
of
mounting
on
horseback
again
they
rode
on
till
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
and
had
only
one
post
more
between
them
and
blois
but
here
a
diabolical
accident
alarmed
aramis
greatly
there
were
no
horses
at
the
post
the
prelate
asked
himself
by
what
infernal
machination
his
enemies
had
succeeded
in
depriving
him
of
the
means
of
going
furtherhe
who
never
recognized
chance
as
a
deity
who
found
a
cause
for
every
accident
preferred
believing
that
the
refusal
of
the
postmaster
at
such
an
hour
in
such
a
country
was
the
consequence
of
an
order
emanating
from
above
an
order
given
with
a
view
of
stopping
short
the
kingmaker
in
the
midst
of
his
flight
but
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
fly
into
a
passion
so
as
to
procure
either
a
horse
or
an
explanation
he
was
struck
with
the
recollection
that
the
comte
de
la
fere
lived
in
the
neighborhood
i
am
not
traveling
said
he
i
do
not
want
horses
for
a
whole
stage
find
me
two
horses
to
go
and
pay
a
visit
to
a
nobleman
of
my
acquaintance
who
resides
near
this
place
what
nobleman
asked
the
postmaster
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
oh
replied
the
postmaster
uncovering
with
respect
a
very
worthy
nobleman
but
whatever
may
be
my
desire
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
him
i
cannot
furnish
you
with
horses
for
all
mine
are
engaged
by
m
le
duc
de
beaufort
indeed
said
aramis
much
disappointed
only
continued
the
postmaster
if
you
will
put
up
with
a
little
carriage
i
have
i
will
harness
an
old
blind
horse
who
has
still
his
legs
left
and
peradventure
will
draw
you
to
the
house
of
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
it
is
worth
a
louis
said
aramis
no
monsieur
such
a
ride
is
worth
no
more
than
a
crown
that
is
what
m
grimaud
the
comtes
intendant
always
pays
me
when
he
makes
use
of
that
carriage
and
i
should
not
wish
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
have
to
reproach
me
with
having
imposed
on
one
of
his
friends
as
you
please
said
aramis
particularly
as
regards
disobliging
the
comte
de
la
fere
only
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
give
you
a
louis
for
your
idea
oh
doubtless
replied
the
postmaster
with
delight
and
he
himself
harnessed
the
ancient
horse
to
the
creaking
carriage
in
the
meantime
porthos
was
curious
to
behold
he
imagined
he
had
discovered
a
clew
to
the
secret
and
he
felt
pleased
because
a
visit
to
athos
in
the
first
place
promised
him
much
satisfaction
and
in
the
next
gave
him
the
hope
of
finding
at
the
same
time
a
good
bed
and
good
supper
the
master
having
got
the
carriage
ready
ordered
one
of
his
men
to
drive
the
strangers
to
la
fere
porthos
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
aramis
whispering
in
his
ear
i
understand
aha
said
aramis
and
what
do
you
understand
my
friend
we
are
going
on
the
part
of
the
king
to
make
some
great
proposal
to
athos
pooh
said
aramis
you
need
tell
me
nothing
about
it
added
the
worthy
porthos
endeavoring
to
reseat
himself
so
as
to
avoid
the
jolting
you
need
tell
me
nothing
i
shall
guess
well
do
my
friend
guess
away
they
arrived
at
athoss
dwelling
about
nine
oclock
in
the
evening
favored
by
a
splendid
moon
this
cheerful
light
rejoiced
porthos
beyond
expression
but
aramis
appeared
annoyed
by
it
in
an
equal
degree
he
could
not
help
showing
something
of
this
to
porthos
who
replieday
ay
i
guess
how
it
is
the
mission
is
a
secret
one
these
were
his
last
words
in
the
carriage
the
driver
interrupted
him
by
saying
gentlemen
we
have
arrived
porthos
and
his
companion
alighted
before
the
gate
of
the
little
chateau
where
we
are
about
to
meet
again
our
old
acquaintances
athos
and
bragelonne
the
latter
of
whom
had
disappeared
since
the
discovery
of
the
infidelity
of
la
valliere
if
there
be
one
saying
truer
than
another
it
is
this
great
griefs
contain
within
themselves
the
germ
of
consolation
this
painful
wound
inflicted
upon
raoul
had
drawn
him
nearer
to
his
father
again
and
god
knows
how
sweet
were
the
consolations
which
flowed
from
the
eloquent
mouth
and
generous
heart
of
athos
the
wound
was
not
cicatrized
but
athos
by
dint
of
conversing
with
his
son
and
mixing
a
little
more
of
his
life
with
that
of
the
young
man
had
brought
him
to
understand
that
this
pang
of
a
first
infidelity
is
necessary
to
every
human
existence
and
that
no
one
has
loved
without
encountering
it
raoul
listened
again
and
again
but
never
understood
nothing
replaces
in
the
deeply
afflicted
heart
the
remembrance
and
thought
of
the
beloved
object
raoul
then
replied
to
the
reasoning
of
his
father
monsieur
all
that
you
tell
me
is
true
i
believe
that
no
one
has
suffered
in
the
affections
of
the
heart
so
much
as
you
have
but
you
are
a
man
too
great
by
reason
of
intelligence
and
too
severely
tried
by
adverse
fortune
not
to
allow
for
the
weakness
of
the
soldier
who
suffers
for
the
first
time
i
am
paying
a
tribute
that
will
not
be
paid
a
second
time
permit
me
to
plunge
myself
so
deeply
in
my
grief
that
i
may
forget
myself
in
it
that
i
may
drown
even
my
reason
in
it
raoul
raoul
listen
monsieur
never
shall
i
accustom
myself
to
the
idea
that
louise
the
chastest
and
most
innocent
of
women
has
been
able
to
so
basely
deceive
a
man
so
honest
and
so
true
a
lover
as
myself
never
can
i
persuade
myself
that
i
see
that
sweet
and
noble
mask
change
into
a
hypocritical
lascivious
face
louise
lost
louise
infamous
ah
monseigneur
that
idea
is
much
more
cruel
to
me
than
raoul
abandonedraoul
unhappy
athos
then
employed
the
heroic
remedy
he
defended
louise
against
raoul
and
justified
her
perfidy
by
her
love
a
woman
who
would
have
yielded
to
a
king
because
he
is
a
king
said
he
would
deserve
to
be
styled
infamous
but
louise
loves
louis
young
both
they
have
forgotten
he
his
rank
she
her
vows
love
absolves
everything
raoul
the
two
young
people
love
each
other
with
sincerity
and
when
he
had
dealt
this
severe
poniardthrust
athos
with
a
sigh
saw
raoul
bound
away
beneath
the
rankling
wound
and
fly
to
the
thickest
recesses
of
the
wood
or
the
solitude
of
his
chamber
whence
an
hour
after
he
would
return
pale
trembling
but
subdued
then
coming
up
to
athos
with
a
smile
he
would
kiss
his
hand
like
the
dog
who
having
been
beaten
caresses
a
respected
master
to
redeem
his
fault
raoul
redeemed
nothing
but
his
weakness
and
only
confessed
his
grief
thus
passed
away
the
days
that
followed
that
scene
in
which
athos
had
so
violently
shaken
the
indomitable
pride
of
the
king
never
when
conversing
with
his
son
did
he
make
any
allusion
to
that
scene
never
did
he
give
him
the
details
of
that
vigorous
lecture
which
might
perhaps
have
consoled
the
young
man
by
showing
him
his
rival
humbled
athos
did
not
wish
that
the
offended
lover
should
forget
the
respect
due
to
his
king
and
when
bragelonne
ardent
angry
and
melancholy
spoke
with
contempt
of
royal
words
of
the
equivocal
faith
which
certain
madmen
draw
from
promises
that
emanate
from
thrones
when
passing
over
two
centuries
with
that
rapidity
of
a
bird
that
traverses
a
narrow
strait
to
go
from
one
continent
to
the
other
raoul
ventured
to
predict
the
time
in
which
kings
would
be
esteemed
as
less
than
other
men
athos
said
to
him
in
his
serene
persuasive
voice
you
are
right
raoul
all
that
you
say
will
happen
kings
will
lose
their
privileges
as
stars
which
have
survived
their
aeons
lose
their
splendor
but
when
that
moment
comes
raoul
we
shall
be
dead
and
remember
well
what
i
say
to
you
in
this
world
all
men
women
and
kings
must
live
for
the
present
we
can
only
live
for
the
future
for
god
this
was
the
manner
in
which
athos
and
raoul
were
as
usual
conversing
and
walking
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
long
alley
of
limes
in
the
park
when
the
bell
which
served
to
announce
to
the
comte
either
the
hour
of
dinner
or
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
was
rung
and
without
attaching
any
importance
to
it
he
turned
towards
the
house
with
his
son
and
at
the
end
of
the
alley
they
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
aramis
and
porthos
chapter
xxvi
the
last
adieux
raoul
uttered
a
cry
and
affectionately
embraced
porthos
aramis
and
athos
embraced
like
old
men
and
this
embrace
itself
being
a
question
for
aramis
he
immediately
said
my
friend
we
have
not
long
to
remain
with
you
ah
said
the
comte
only
time
to
tell
you
of
my
good
fortune
interrupted
porthos
ah
said
raoul
athos
looked
silently
at
aramis
whose
somber
air
had
already
appeared
to
him
very
little
in
harmony
with
the
good
news
porthos
hinted
what
is
the
good
fortune
that
has
happened
to
you
let
us
hear
it
said
raoul
with
a
smile
the
king
has
made
me
a
duke
said
the
worthy
porthos
with
an
air
of
mystery
in
the
ear
of
the
young
man
a
duke
by
brevet
but
the
asides
of
porthos
were
always
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
everybody
his
murmurs
were
in
the
diapason
of
ordinary
roaring
athos
heard
him
and
uttered
an
exclamation
which
made
aramis
start
the
latter
took
athos
by
the
arm
and
after
having
asked
porthoss
permission
to
say
a
word
to
his
friend
in
private
my
dear
athos
he
began
you
see
me
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
trouble
with
grief
and
trouble
my
dear
friend
cried
the
comte
oh
what
in
two
words
i
have
conspired
against
the
king
that
conspiracy
has
failed
and
at
this
moment
i
am
doubtless
pursued
you
are
pursueda
conspiracy
eh
my
friend
what
do
you
tell
me
the
saddest
truth
i
am
entirely
ruined
well
but
porthosthis
title
of
dukewhat
does
all
that
mean
that
is
the
subject
of
my
severest
pain
that
is
the
deepest
of
my
wounds
i
have
believing
in
infallible
success
drawn
porthos
into
my
conspiracy
he
threw
himself
into
it
as
you
know
he
would
do
with
all
his
strength
without
knowing
what
he
was
about
and
now
he
is
as
much
compromised
as
myselfas
completely
ruined
as
i
am
good
god
and
athos
turned
towards
porthos
who
was
smiling
complacently
i
must
make
you
acquainted
with
the
whole
listen
to
me
continued
aramis
and
he
related
the
history
as
we
know
it
athos
during
the
recital
several
times
felt
the
sweat
break
from
his
forehead
it
was
a
great
idea
said
he
but
a
great
error
for
which
i
am
punished
athos
therefore
i
will
not
tell
you
my
entire
thought
tell
it
nevertheless
it
is
a
crime
a
capital
crime
i
know
it
is
lese
majeste
porthos
poor
porthos
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
success
as
i
have
told
you
was
certain
m
fouquet
is
an
honest
man
and
i
a
fool
for
having
so
illjudged
him
said
aramis
oh
the
wisdom
of
man
oh
millstone
that
grinds
the
world
and
which
is
one
day
stopped
by
a
grain
of
sand
which
has
fallen
no
one
knows
how
between
its
wheels
say
by
a
diamond
aramis
but
the
thing
is
done
how
do
you
think
of
acting
i
am
taking
away
porthos
the
king
will
never
believe
that
that
worthy
man
has
acted
innocently
he
never
can
believe
that
porthos
has
thought
he
was
serving
the
king
whilst
acting
as
he
has
done
his
head
would
pay
my
fault
it
shall
not
must
not
be
so
you
are
taking
him
away
whither
to
belleisle
at
first
that
is
an
impregnable
place
of
refuge
then
i
have
the
sea
and
a
vessel
to
pass
over
into
england
where
i
have
many
relations
you
in
england
yes
or
else
in
spain
where
i
have
still
more
but
our
excellent
porthos
you
ruin
him
for
the
king
will
confiscate
all
his
property
all
is
provided
for
i
know
how
when
once
in
spain
to
reconcile
myself
with
louis
xiv
and
restore
porthos
to
favor
you
have
credit
seemingly
aramis
said
athos
with
a
discreet
air
much
and
at
the
service
of
my
friends
these
words
were
accompanied
by
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
thank
you
replied
the
comte
and
while
we
are
on
this
head
said
aramis
you
also
are
a
malcontent
you
also
raoul
have
griefs
to
lay
to
the
king
follow
our
example
pass
over
into
belleisle
then
we
shall
see
i
guarantee
upon
my
honor
that
in
a
month
there
will
be
war
between
france
and
spain
on
the
subject
of
this
son
of
louis
xiii
who
is
an
infante
likewise
and
whom
france
detains
inhumanly
now
as
louis
xiv
would
have
no
inclination
for
a
war
on
that
subject
i
will
answer
for
an
arrangement
the
result
of
which
must
bring
greatness
to
porthos
and
to
me
and
a
duchy
in
france
to
you
who
are
already
a
grandee
of
spain
will
you
join
us
no
for
my
part
i
prefer
having
something
to
reproach
the
king
with
it
is
a
pride
natural
to
my
race
to
pretend
to
a
superiority
over
royal
races
doing
what
you
propose
i
should
become
the
obliged
of
the
king
i
should
certainly
be
the
gainer
on
that
ground
but
i
should
be
a
loser
in
my
conscienceno
thank
you
then
give
me
two
things
athosyour
absolution
oh
i
give
it
you
if
you
really
wished
to
avenge
the
weak
and
oppressed
against
the
oppressor
that
is
sufficient
for
me
said
aramis
with
a
blush
which
was
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
and
now
give
me
your
two
best
horses
to
gain
the
second
post
as
i
have
been
refused
any
under
the
pretext
of
the
duc
de
beaufort
being
traveling
in
this
country
you
shall
have
the
two
best
horses
aramis
and
again
i
recommend
poor
porthos
strongly
to
your
care
oh
i
have
no
fear
on
that
score
one
word
more
do
you
think
i
am
maneuvering
for
him
as
i
ought
the
evil
being
committed
yes
for
the
king
would
not
pardon
him
and
you
have
whatever
may
be
said
always
a
supporter
in
m
fouquet
who
will
not
abandon
you
he
being
himself
compromised
notwithstanding
his
heroic
action
you
are
right
and
that
is
why
instead
of
gaining
the
sea
at
once
which
would
proclaim
my
fear
and
guilt
that
is
why
i
remain
upon
french
ground
but
belleisle
will
be
for
me
whatever
ground
i
wish
it
to
be
english
spanish
or
roman
all
will
depend
with
me
on
the
standard
i
shall
think
proper
to
unfurl
how
so
it
was
i
who
fortified
belleisle
and
so
long
as
i
defend
it
nobody
can
take
belleisle
from
me
and
then
as
you
have
said
just
now
m
fouquet
is
there
belleisle
will
not
be
attacked
without
the
signature
of
m
fouquet
that
is
true
nevertheless
be
prudent
the
king
is
both
cunning
and
strong
aramis
smiled
i
again
recommend
porthos
to
you
repeated
the
count
with
a
sort
of
cold
persistence
whatever
becomes
of
me
count
replied
aramis
in
the
same
tone
our
brother
porthos
will
fare
as
i
door
better
athos
bowed
whilst
pressing
the
hand
of
aramis
and
turned
to
embrace
porthos
with
emotion
i
was
born
lucky
was
i
not
murmured
the
latter
transported
with
happiness
as
he
folded
his
cloak
round
him
come
my
dear
friend
said
aramis
raoul
had
gone
out
to
give
orders
for
the
saddling
of
the
horses
the
group
was
already
divided
athos
saw
his
two
friends
on
the
point
of
departure
and
something
like
a
mist
passed
before
his
eyes
and
weighed
upon
his
heart
it
is
strange
thought
he
whence
comes
the
inclination
i
feel
to
embrace
porthos
once
more
at
that
moment
porthos
turned
round
and
he
came
towards
his
old
friend
with
open
arms
this
last
endearment
was
tender
as
in
youth
as
in
times
when
hearts
were
warmlife
happy
and
then
porthos
mounted
his
horse
aramis
came
back
once
more
to
throw
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
athos
the
latter
watched
them
along
the
highroad
elongated
by
the
shade
in
their
white
cloaks
like
phantoms
they
seemed
to
enlarge
on
their
departure
from
the
earth
and
it
was
not
in
the
mist
but
in
the
declivity
of
the
ground
that
they
disappeared
at
the
end
of
the
perspective
both
seemed
to
have
given
a
spring
with
their
feet
which
made
them
vanish
as
if
evaporated
into
cloudland
then
athos
with
a
very
heavy
heart
returned
towards
the
house
saying
to
bragelonne
raoul
i
dont
know
what
it
is
that
has
just
told
me
that
i
have
seen
those
two
for
the
last
time
it
does
not
astonish
me
monsieur
that
you
should
have
such
a
thought
replied
the
young
man
for
i
have
at
this
moment
the
same
and
think
also
that
i
shall
never
see
messieurs
du
vallon
and
dherblay
again
oh
you
replied
the
count
you
speak
like
a
man
rendered
sad
by
a
different
cause
you
see
everything
in
black
you
are
young
and
if
you
chance
never
to
see
those
old
friends
again
it
will
because
they
no
longer
exist
in
the
world
in
which
you
have
yet
many
years
to
pass
but
i
raoul
shook
his
head
sadly
and
leaned
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
count
without
either
of
them
finding
another
word
in
their
hearts
which
were
ready
to
overflow
all
at
once
a
noise
of
horses
and
voices
from
the
extremity
of
the
road
to
blois
attracted
their
attention
that
way
flambeauxbearers
shook
their
torches
merrily
among
the
trees
of
their
route
and
turned
round
from
time
to
time
to
avoid
distancing
the
horsemen
who
followed
them
these
flames
this
noise
this
dust
of
a
dozen
richly
caparisoned
horses
formed
a
strange
contrast
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
the
melancholy
and
almost
funereal
disappearance
of
the
two
shadows
of
aramis
and
porthos
athos
went
towards
the
house
but
he
had
hardly
reached
the
parterre
when
the
entrance
gate
appeared
in
a
blaze
all
the
flambeaux
stopped
and
appeared
to
enflame
the
road
a
cry
was
heard
of
m
le
duc
de
beaufortand
athos
sprang
towards
the
door
of
his
house
but
the
duke
had
already
alighted
from
his
horse
and
was
looking
around
him
i
am
here
monseigneur
said
athos
ah
good
evening
dear
count
said
the
prince
with
that
frank
cordiality
which
won
him
so
many
hearts
is
it
too
late
for
a
friend
ah
my
dear
prince
come
in
said
the
count
and
m
de
beaufort
leaning
on
the
arm
of
athos
they
entered
the
house
followed
by
raoul
who
walked
respectfully
and
modestly
among
the
officers
of
the
prince
with
several
of
whom
he
was
acquainted
chapter
xxvii
monsieur
de
beaufort
the
prince
turned
round
at
the
moment
when
raoul
in
order
to
leave
him
alone
with
athos
was
shutting
the
door
and
preparing
to
go
with
the
other
officers
into
an
adjoining
apartment
is
that
the
young
man
i
have
heard
m
le
prince
speak
so
highly
of
asked
m
de
beaufort
it
is
monseigneur
he
is
quite
the
soldier
let
him
stay
count
we
cannot
spare
him
remain
raoul
since
monseigneur
permits
it
said
athos
ma
foi
he
is
tall
and
handsome
continued
the
duke
will
you
give
him
to
me
monseigneur
if
i
ask
him
of
you
how
am
i
to
understand
you
monseigneur
said
athos
why
i
call
upon
you
to
bid
you
farewell
farewell
yes
in
good
truth
have
you
no
idea
of
what
i
am
about
to
become
why
i
suppose
what
you
have
always
been
monseigneura
valiant
prince
and
an
excellent
gentleman
i
am
going
to
become
an
african
princea
bedouin
gentleman
the
king
is
sending
me
to
make
conquests
among
the
arabs
what
is
this
you
tell
me
monseigneur
strange
is
it
not
i
the
parisian
par
essence
i
who
have
reigned
in
the
faubourgs
and
have
been
called
king
of
the
hallesi
am
going
to
pass
from
the
place
maubert
to
the
minarets
of
gigelli
from
a
frondeur
i
am
becoming
an
adventurer
oh
monseigneur
if
you
did
not
yourself
tell
me
that
it
would
not
be
credible
would
it
believe
me
nevertheless
and
we
have
but
to
bid
each
other
farewell
this
is
what
comes
of
getting
into
favor
again
into
favor
yes
you
smile
ah
my
dear
count
do
you
know
why
i
have
accepted
this
enterprise
can
you
guess
because
your
highness
loves
glory
aboveeverything
oh
no
there
is
no
glory
in
firing
muskets
at
savages
i
see
no
glory
in
that
for
my
part
and
it
is
more
probable
that
i
shall
there
meet
with
something
else
but
i
have
wished
and
still
wish
earnestly
my
dear
count
that
my
life
should
have
that
last
facet
after
all
the
whimsical
exhibitions
i
have
seen
myself
make
during
fifty
years
for
in
short
you
must
admit
that
it
is
sufficiently
strange
to
be
born
the
grandson
of
a
king
to
have
made
war
against
kings
to
have
been
reckoned
among
the
powers
of
the
age
to
have
maintained
my
rank
to
feel
henry
iv
within
me
to
be
great
admiral
of
franceand
then
to
go
and
get
killed
at
gigelli
among
all
those
turks
saracens
and
moors
monseigneur
you
harp
with
strange
persistence
on
that
theme
said
athos
in
an
agitated
voice
how
can
you
suppose
that
so
brilliant
a
destiny
will
be
extinguished
in
that
remote
and
miserable
scene
and
can
you
believe
upright
and
simple
as
you
are
that
if
i
go
into
africa
for
this
ridiculous
motive
i
will
not
endeavor
to
come
out
of
it
without
ridicule
shall
i
not
give
the
world
cause
to
speak
of
me
and
to
be
spoken
of
nowadays
when
there
are
monsieur
le
prince
m
de
turenne
and
many
others
my
contemporaries
i
admiral
of
france
grandson
of
henry
iv
king
of
paris
have
i
anything
left
but
to
get
myself
killed
cordieu
i
will
be
talked
of
i
tell
you
i
shall
be
killed
whether
or
not
if
not
there
somewhere
else
why
monseigneur
this
is
mere
exaggeration
and
hitherto
you
have
shown
nothing
exaggerated
save
in
bravery
peste
my
dear
friend
there
is
bravery
in
facing
scurvy
dysentery
locusts
poisoned
arrows
as
my
ancestor
st
louis
did
do
you
know
those
fellows
still
use
poisoned
arrows
and
then
you
know
me
of
old
i
fancy
and
you
know
that
when
i
once
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
i
perform
it
in
grim
earnest
yes
you
made
up
your
mind
to
escape
from
vincennes
ay
but
you
aided
me
in
that
my
master
and
a
propos
i
turn
this
way
and
that
without
seeing
my
old
friend
m
vaugrimaud
how
is
he
m
vaugrimaud
is
still
your
highnesss
most
respectful
servant
said
athos
smiling
i
have
a
hundred
pistoles
here
for
him
which
i
bring
as
a
legacy
my
will
is
made
count
ah
monseigneur
monseigneur
and
you
may
understand
that
if
grimauds
name
were
to
appear
in
my
will
the
duke
began
to
laugh
then
addressing
raoul
who
from
the
commencement
of
this
conversation
had
sunk
into
a
profound
reverie
young
man
said
he
i
know
there
is
to
be
found
here
a
certain
de
vouvray
wine
and
i
believe
raoul
left
the
room
precipitately
to
order
the
wine
in
the
meantime
m
de
beaufort
took
the
hand
of
athos
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
him
asked
he
nothing
at
present
monseigneur
ah
yes
i
know
since
the
passion
of
the
king
for
la
valliere
yes
monseigneur
that
is
all
true
then
is
it
i
think
i
know
her
that
little
la
valliere
she
is
not
particularly
handsome
if
i
remember
right
no
monseigneur
said
athos
do
you
know
whom
she
reminds
me
of
does
she
remind
your
highness
of
any
one
she
reminds
me
of
a
very
agreeable
girl
whose
mother
lived
in
the
halles
ah
ah
said
athos
smiling
oh
the
good
old
times
added
m
de
beaufort
yes
la
valliere
reminds
me
of
that
girl
who
had
a
son
had
she
not
3
i
believe
she
had
replied
the
duke
with
careless
naivete
and
a
complaisant
forgetfulness
of
which
no
words
could
translate
the
tone
and
the
vocal
expression
now
here
is
poor
raoul
who
is
your
son
i
believe
yes
he
is
my
son
monseigneur
and
the
poor
lad
has
been
cut
out
by
the
king
and
he
frets
still
better
monseigneur
he
abstains
you
are
going
to
let
the
boy
rust
in
idleness
it
is
a
mistake
come
give
him
to
me
my
wish
is
to
keep
him
at
home
monseigneur
i
have
no
longer
anything
in
the
world
but
him
and
as
long
as
he
likes
to
remain
well
well
replied
the
duke
i
could
nevertheless
have
soon
put
matters
to
rights
again
i
assure
you
i
think
he
has
in
him
the
stuff
of
which
marechals
of
france
are
made
i
have
seen
more
than
one
produced
from
less
likely
rough
material
that
is
very
possible
monseigneur
but
it
is
the
king
who
makes
marechals
of
france
and
raoul
will
never
accept
anything
of
the
king
raoul
interrupted
this
conversation
by
his
return
he
preceded
grimaud
whose
still
steady
hands
carried
the
plateau
with
one
glass
and
a
bottle
of
the
dukes
favorite
wine
on
seeing
his
old
protege
the
duke
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
grimaud
good
evening
grimaud
said
he
how
goes
it
the
servant
bowed
profoundly
as
much
gratified
as
his
noble
interlocutor
two
old
friends
said
the
duke
shaking
honest
grimauds
shoulder
after
a
vigorous
fashion
which
was
followed
by
another
still
more
profound
and
delighted
bow
from
grimaud
but
what
is
this
count
only
one
glass
i
should
not
think
of
drinking
with
your
highness
unless
your
highness
permitted
me
replied
athos
with
noble
humility
cordieu
you
were
right
to
bring
only
one
glass
we
will
both
drink
out
of
it
like
two
brothers
in
arms
begin
count
do
me
the
honor
said
athos
gently
putting
back
the
glass
you
are
a
charming
friend
replied
the
duc
de
beaufort
who
drank
and
passed
the
goblet
to
his
companion
but
that
is
not
all
continued
he
i
am
still
thirsty
and
i
wish
to
do
honor
to
this
handsome
young
man
who
stands
here
i
carry
good
luck
with
me
vicomte
said
he
to
raoul
wish
for
something
while
drinking
out
of
my
glass
and
may
the
black
plague
grab
me
if
what
you
wish
does
not
come
to
pass
he
held
the
goblet
to
raoul
who
hastily
moistened
his
lips
and
replied
with
the
same
promptitude
i
have
wished
for
something
monseigneur
his
eyes
sparkled
with
a
gloomy
fire
and
the
blood
mounted
to
his
cheeks
he
terrified
athos
if
only
with
his
smile
and
what
have
you
wished
for
replied
the
duke
sinking
back
into
his
fauteuil
whilst
with
one
hand
he
returned
the
bottle
to
grimaud
and
with
the
other
gave
him
a
purse
will
you
promise
me
monseigneur
to
grant
me
what
i
wish
for
pardieu
that
is
agreed
upon
i
wished
monsieur
le
duc
to
go
with
you
to
gigelli
athos
became
pale
and
was
unable
to
conceal
his
agitation
the
duke
looked
at
his
friend
as
if
desirous
to
assist
him
to
parry
this
unexpected
blow
that
is
difficult
my
dear
vicomte
very
difficult
added
he
in
a
lower
tone
of
voice
pardon
me
monseigneur
i
have
been
indiscreet
replied
raoul
in
a
firm
voice
but
as
you
yourself
invited
me
to
wish
to
wish
to
leave
me
said
athos
oh
monsieurcan
you
imagine
well
mordieu
cried
the
duke
the
young
vicomte
is
right
what
can
he
do
here
he
will
go
moldy
with
grief
raoul
blushed
and
the
excitable
prince
continued
war
is
a
distraction
we
gain
everything
by
it
we
can
only
lose
one
thing
by
itlifethen
so
much
the
worse
that
is
to
say
memory
said
raoul
eagerly
and
that
is
to
say
so
much
the
better
he
repented
of
having
spoken
so
warmly
when
he
saw
athos
rise
and
open
the
window
which
was
doubtless
to
conceal
his
emotion
raoul
sprang
towards
the
comte
but
the
latter
had
already
overcome
his
emotion
and
turned
to
the
lights
with
a
serene
and
impassible
countenance
well
come
said
the
duke
let
us
see
shall
he
go
or
shall
he
not
if
he
goes

cried
raoul
bending
his
knee
monseigneur
cried
athos
taking
the
hand
of
the
duke
raoul
shall
do
just
as
he
likes
oh
no
monsieur
just
as
you
like
interrupted
the
young
man
par
la
corbleu
said
the
prince
in
his
turn
it
is
neither
the
comte
nor
the
vicomte
that
shall
have
his
way
it
is
i
i
will
take
him
away
the
marine
offers
a
superb
fortune
my
friend
raoul
smiled
again
so
sadly
that
this
time
athos
felt
his
heart
penetrated
by
it
and
replied
to
him
by
a
severe
look
raoul
comprehended
it
all
he
recovered
his
calmness
and
was
so
guarded
that
not
another
word
escaped
him
the
duke
at
length
rose
on
observing
the
advanced
hour
and
said
with
animation
i
am
in
great
haste
but
if
i
am
told
i
have
lost
time
in
talking
with
a
friend
i
will
reply
i
have
gainedon
the
balancea
most
excellent
recruit
pardon
me
monsieur
le
duc
interrupted
raoul
do
not
tell
the
king
so
for
it
is
not
the
king
i
wish
to
serve
eh
my
friend
whom
then
will
you
serve
the
times
are
past
when
you
might
have
said
i
belong
to
m
de
beaufort
no
nowadays
we
all
belong
to
the
king
great
or
small
therefore
if
you
serve
on
board
my
vessels
there
can
be
nothing
equivocal
about
it
my
dear
vicomte
it
will
be
the
king
you
will
serve
athos
waited
with
a
kind
of
impatient
joy
for
the
reply
about
to
be
made
to
this
embarrassing
question
by
raoul
the
intractable
enemy
of
the
king
his
rival
the
father
hoped
that
the
obstacle
would
overcome
the
desire
he
was
thankful
to
m
de
beaufort
whose
lightness
or
generous
reflection
had
thrown
an
impediment
in
the
way
of
the
departure
of
a
son
now
his
only
joy
but
raoul
still
firm
and
tranquil
replied
monsieur
le
duc
the
objection
you
make
i
have
already
considered
in
my
mind
i
will
serve
on
board
your
vessels
because
you
do
me
the
honor
to
take
me
with
you
but
i
shall
there
serve
a
more
powerful
master
than
the
king
i
shall
serve
god
god
how
so
said
the
duke
and
athos
together
my
intention
is
to
make
profession
and
become
a
knight
of
malta
added
bragelonne
letting
fall
one
by
one
words
more
icy
than
the
drops
which
fall
from
the
bare
trees
after
the
tempests
of
winter
4
under
this
blow
athos
staggered
and
the
prince
himself
was
moved
grimaud
uttered
a
heavy
groan
and
let
fall
the
bottle
which
was
broken
without
anybody
paying
attention
m
de
beaufort
looked
the
young
man
in
the
face
and
read
plainly
though
his
eyes
were
cast
down
the
fire
of
resolution
before
which
everything
must
give
way
as
to
athos
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
that
tender
but
inflexible
soul
he
could
not
hope
to
make
it
deviate
from
the
fatal
road
it
had
just
chosen
he
could
only
press
the
hand
the
duke
held
out
to
him
comte
i
shall
set
off
in
two
days
for
toulon
said
m
de
beaufort
will
you
meet
me
at
paris
in
order
that
i
may
know
your
determination
i
will
have
the
honor
of
thanking
you
there
mon
prince
for
all
your
kindness
replied
the
comte
and
be
sure
to
bring
the
vicomte
with
you
whether
he
follows
me
or
does
not
follow
me
added
the
duke
he
has
my
word
and
i
only
ask
yours
having
thrown
a
little
balm
upon
the
wound
of
the
paternal
heart
he
pulled
the
ear
of
grimaud
whose
eyes
sparkled
more
than
usual
and
regained
his
escort
in
the
parterre
the
horses
rested
and
refreshed
set
off
with
spirit
through
the
lovely
night
and
soon
placed
a
considerable
distance
between
their
master
and
the
chateau
athos
and
bragelonne
were
again
face
to
face
eleven
oclock
was
striking
the
father
and
son
preserved
a
profound
silence
towards
each
other
where
an
intelligent
observer
would
have
expected
cries
and
tears
but
these
two
men
were
of
such
a
nature
that
all
emotion
following
their
final
resolutions
plunged
itself
so
deep
into
their
hearts
that
it
was
lost
forever
they
passed
then
silently
and
almost
breathlessly
the
hour
that
preceded
midnight
the
clock
by
striking
alone
pointed
out
to
them
how
many
minutes
had
lasted
the
painful
journey
made
by
their
souls
in
the
immensity
of
their
remembrances
of
the
past
and
fear
of
the
future
athos
rose
first
saying
it
is
late
then
till
tomorrow
raoul
rose
and
in
his
turn
embraced
his
father
the
latter
held
him
clasped
to
his
breast
and
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
in
two
days
you
will
have
left
me
my
sonleft
me
forever
raoul
monsieur
replied
the
young
man
i
had
formed
a
determination
that
of
piercing
my
heart
with
my
sword
but
you
would
have
thought
that
cowardly
i
have
renounced
that
determination
and
therefore
we
must
part
you
leave
me
desolate
by
going
raoul
listen
to
me
again
monsieur
i
implore
you
if
i
do
not
go
i
shall
die
here
of
grief
and
love
i
know
how
long
a
time
i
have
to
live
thus
send
me
away
quickly
monsieur
or
you
will
see
me
basely
die
before
your
eyesin
your
housethis
is
stronger
than
my
willstronger
than
my
strengthyou
may
plainly
see
that
within
one
month
i
have
lived
thirty
years
and
that
i
approach
the
end
of
my
life
then
said
athos
coldly
you
go
with
the
intention
of
getting
killed
in
africa
oh
tell
me
do
not
lie
raoul
grew
deadly
pale
and
remained
silent
for
two
seconds
which
were
to
his
father
two
hours
of
agony
then
all
at
once
monsieur
said
he
i
have
promised
to
devote
myself
to
god
in
exchange
for
the
sacrifice
i
make
of
my
youth
and
liberty
i
will
only
ask
of
him
one
thing
and
that
is
to
preserve
me
for
you
because
you
are
the
only
tie
which
attaches
me
to
this
world
god
alone
can
give
me
the
strength
not
to
forget
that
i
owe
you
everything
and
that
nothing
ought
to
stand
in
my
esteem
before
you
athos
embraced
his
son
tenderly
and
said
you
have
just
replied
to
me
on
the
word
of
honor
of
an
honest
man
in
two
days
we
shall
be
with
m
de
beaufort
at
paris
and
you
will
then
do
what
will
be
proper
for
you
to
do
you
are
free
raoul
adieu
and
he
slowly
gained
his
bedroom
raoul
went
down
into
the
garden
and
passed
the
night
in
the
alley
of
limes
chapter
xxviii
preparations
for
departure
athos
lost
no
more
time
in
combating
this
immutable
resolution
he
gave
all
his
attention
to
preparing
during
the
two
days
the
duke
had
granted
him
the
proper
appointments
for
raoul
this
labor
chiefly
concerned
grimaud
who
immediately
applied
himself
to
it
with
the
goodwill
and
intelligence
we
know
he
possessed
athos
gave
this
worthy
servant
orders
to
take
the
route
to
paris
when
the
equipments
should
be
ready
and
not
to
expose
himself
to
the
danger
of
keeping
the
duke
waiting
or
delaying
raoul
so
that
the
duke
should
perceive
his
absence
he
himself
the
day
after
the
visit
of
m
de
beaufort
set
off
for
paris
with
his
son
for
the
poor
young
man
it
was
an
emotion
easily
to
be
understood
thus
to
return
to
paris
amongst
all
the
people
who
had
known
and
loved
him
every
face
recalled
a
pang
to
him
who
had
suffered
so
much
to
him
who
had
loved
so
much
some
circumstance
of
his
unhappy
love
raoul
on
approaching
paris
felt
as
if
he
were
dying
once
in
paris
he
really
existed
no
longer
when
he
reached
guiches
residence
he
was
informed
that
guiche
was
with
monsieur
raoul
took
the
road
to
the
luxembourg
and
when
arrived
without
suspecting
that
he
was
going
to
the
place
where
la
valliere
had
lived
he
heard
so
much
music
and
respired
so
many
perfumes
he
heard
so
much
joyous
laughter
and
saw
so
many
dancing
shadows
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
charitable
woman
who
perceived
him
so
dejected
and
pale
beneath
a
doorway
he
would
have
remained
there
a
few
minutes
and
then
would
have
gone
away
never
to
return
but
as
we
have
said
in
the
first
antechamber
he
had
stopped
solely
for
the
sake
of
not
mixing
himself
with
all
those
happy
beings
he
felt
were
moving
around
him
in
the
adjacent
salons
and
as
one
of
monsieurs
servants
recognizing
him
had
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
see
monsieur
or
madame
raoul
had
scarcely
answered
him
but
had
sunk
down
upon
a
bench
near
the
velvet
doorway
looking
at
a
clock
which
had
stopped
for
nearly
an
hour
the
servant
had
passed
on
and
another
better
acquainted
with
him
had
come
up
and
interrogated
raoul
whether
he
should
inform
m
de
guiche
of
his
being
there
this
name
did
not
even
arouse
the
recollections
of
raoul
the
persistent
servant
went
on
to
relate
that
de
guiche
had
just
invented
a
new
game
of
lottery
and
was
teaching
it
to
the
ladies
raoul
opening
his
large
eyes
like
the
absent
man
in
theophrastus
made
no
answer
but
his
sadness
increased
two
shades
with
his
head
hanging
down
his
limbs
relaxed
his
mouth
half
open
for
the
escape
of
his
sighs
raoul
remained
thus
forgotten
in
the
antechamber
when
all
at
once
a
ladys
robe
passed
rubbing
against
the
doors
of
a
side
salon
which
opened
on
the
gallery
a
lady
young
pretty
and
gay
scolding
an
officer
of
the
household
entered
by
that
way
and
expressed
herself
with
much
vivacity
the
officer
replied
in
calm
but
firm
sentences
it
was
rather
a
little
love
pet
than
a
quarrel
of
courtiers
and
was
terminated
by
a
kiss
on
the
fingers
of
the
lady
suddenly
on
perceiving
raoul
the
lady
became
silent
and
pushing
away
the
officer
make
your
escape
malicorne
said
she
i
did
not
think
there
was
any
one
here
i
shall
curse
you
if
they
have
either
heard
or
seen
us
malicorne
hastened
away
the
young
lady
advanced
behind
raoul
and
stretching
her
joyous
face
over
him
as
he
lay
monsieur
is
a
gallant
man
said
she
and
no
doubt
she
here
interrupted
herself
by
uttering
a
cry
raoul
said
she
blushing
mademoiselle
de
montalais
said
raoul
paler
than
death
he
rose
unsteadily
and
tried
to
make
his
way
across
the
slippery
mosaic
of
the
floor
but
she
had
comprehended
that
savage
and
cruel
grief
she
felt
that
in
the
flight
of
raoul
there
was
an
accusation
of
herself
a
woman
ever
vigilant
she
did
not
think
she
ought
to
let
the
opportunity
slip
of
making
good
her
justification
but
raoul
though
stopped
by
her
in
the
middle
of
the
gallery
did
not
seem
disposed
to
surrender
without
a
combat
he
took
it
up
in
a
tone
so
cold
and
embarrassed
that
if
they
had
been
thus
surprised
the
whole
court
would
have
no
doubt
about
the
proceedings
of
mademoiselle
de
montalais
ah
monsieur
said
she
with
disdain
what
you
are
doing
is
very
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
my
heart
inclines
me
to
speak
to
you
you
compromise
me
by
a
reception
almost
uncivil
you
are
wrong
monsieur
and
you
confound
your
friends
with
enemies
farewell
raoul
had
sworn
never
to
speak
of
louise
never
even
to
look
at
those
who
might
have
seen
louise
he
was
going
into
another
world
that
he
might
never
meet
with
anything
louise
had
seen
or
even
touched
but
after
the
first
shock
of
his
pride
after
having
had
a
glimpse
of
montalais
the
companion
of
louisemontalais
who
reminded
him
of
the
turret
of
blois
and
the
joys
of
youthall
his
reason
faded
away
pardon
me
mademoiselle
it
enters
not
it
cannot
enter
into
my
thoughts
to
be
uncivil
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
said
she
with
the
smile
of
former
days
well
come
somewhere
else
for
we
may
be
surprised
oh
said
he
she
looked
at
the
clock
doubtingly
then
having
reflected
in
my
apartment
said
she
we
shall
have
an
hour
to
ourselves
and
taking
her
course
lighter
than
a
fairy
she
ran
up
to
her
chamber
followed
by
raoul
shutting
the
door
and
placing
in
the
hands
of
her
cameriste
the
mantle
she
had
held
upon
her
arm
you
were
seeking
m
de
guiche
were
you
not
said
she
to
raoul
yes
mademoiselle
i
will
go
and
ask
him
to
come
up
here
presently
after
i
have
spoken
to
you
do
so
mademoiselle
are
you
angry
with
me
raoul
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
then
casting
down
his
eyes
yes
said
he
you
think
i
was
concerned
in
the
plot
which
brought
about
the
rupture
do
you
not
rupture
said
he
with
bitterness
oh
mademoiselle
there
can
be
no
rupture
where
there
has
been
no
love
you
are
in
error
replied
montalais
louise
did
love
you
raoul
started
not
with
love
i
know
but
she
liked
you
and
you
ought
to
have
married
her
before
you
set
out
for
london
raoul
broke
into
a
sinister
laugh
which
made
montalais
shudder
you
tell
me
that
very
much
at
your
ease
mademoiselle
do
people
marry
whom
they
like
you
forget
that
the
king
then
kept
for
himself
as
his
mistress
her
of
whom
we
are
speaking
listen
said
the
young
woman
pressing
the
hands
of
raoul
in
her
own
you
were
wrong
in
every
way
a
man
of
your
age
ought
never
to
leave
a
woman
of
hers
alone
there
is
no
longer
any
faith
in
the
world
then
said
raoul
no
vicomte
said
montalais
quietly
nevertheless
let
me
tell
you
that
if
instead
of
loving
louise
coldly
and
philosophically
you
had
endeavored
to
awaken
her
to
love
enough
i
pray
you
mademoiselle
said
raoul
i
feel
as
though
you
are
all
of
both
sexes
of
a
different
age
from
me
you
can
laugh
and
you
can
banter
agreeably
i
mademoiselle
i
loved
mademoiselle
de
raoul
could
not
pronounce
her
namei
loved
her
well
i
put
my
faith
in
hernow
i
am
quits
by
loving
her
no
longer
oh
vicomte
said
montalais
pointing
to
his
reflection
in
a
lookingglass
i
know
what
you
mean
mademoiselle
i
am
much
altered
am
i
not
well
do
you
know
why
because
my
face
is
the
mirror
of
my
heart
the
outer
surface
changed
to
match
the
mind
within
you
are
consoled
then
said
montalais
sharply
no
i
shall
never
be
consoled
i
dont
understand
you
m
de
bragelonne
i
care
but
little
for
that
i
do
not
quite
understand
myself
you
have
not
even
tried
to
speak
to
louise
who
i
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
eyes
flashing
fire
iwhy
do
you
not
advise
me
to
marry
her
perhaps
the
king
would
consent
now
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
full
of
anger
i
see
said
montalais
that
you
are
not
cured
and
that
louise
has
one
enemy
the
more
one
enemy
the
more
yes
favorites
are
but
little
beloved
at
the
court
of
france
oh
while
she
has
her
lover
to
protect
her
is
not
that
enough
she
has
chosen
him
of
such
a
quality
that
her
enemies
cannot
prevail
against
her
but
stopping
all
at
once
and
then
she
has
you
for
a
friend
mademoiselle
added
he
with
a
shade
of
irony
which
did
not
glide
off
the
cuirass
who
ioh
no
i
am
no
longer
one
of
those
whom
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
condescends
to
look
upon
but
this
but
so
big
with
menace
and
with
storm
this
but
which
made
the
heart
of
raoul
beat
such
griefs
did
it
presage
for
her
whom
lately
he
loved
so
dearly
this
terrible
but
so
significant
in
a
woman
like
montalais
was
interrupted
by
a
moderately
loud
noise
heard
by
the
speakers
proceeding
from
the
alcove
behind
the
wainscoting
montalais
turned
to
listen
and
raoul
was
already
rising
when
a
lady
entered
the
room
quietly
by
the
secret
door
which
she
closed
after
her
madame
exclaimed
raoul
on
recognizing
the
sisterinlaw
of
the
king
stupid
wretch
murmured
montalais
throwing
herself
but
too
late
before
the
princess
i
have
been
mistaken
in
an
hour
she
had
however
time
to
warn
the
princess
who
was
walking
towards
raoul
m
de
bragelonne
madame
and
at
these
words
the
princess
drew
back
uttering
a
cry
in
her
turn
your
royal
highness
said
montalais
with
volubility
is
kind
enough
to
think
of
this
lottery
and
the
princess
began
to
lose
countenance
raoul
hastened
his
departure
without
divining
all
but
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
way
madame
was
preparing
a
word
of
transition
to
recover
herself
when
a
closet
opened
in
front
of
the
alcove
and
m
de
guiche
issued
all
radiant
also
from
that
closet
the
palest
of
the
four
we
must
admit
was
still
raoul
the
princess
however
was
near
fainting
and
was
obliged
to
lean
upon
the
foot
of
the
bed
for
support
no
one
ventured
to
support
her
this
scene
occupied
several
minutes
of
terrible
suspense
but
raoul
broke
it
he
went
up
to
the
count
whose
inexpressible
emotion
made
his
knees
tremble
and
taking
his
hand
dear
count
said
he
tell
madame
i
am
too
unhappy
not
to
merit
pardon
tell
her
also
that
i
have
loved
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
that
the
horror
of
the
treachery
that
has
been
practiced
on
me
renders
me
inexorable
towards
all
other
treachery
that
may
be
committed
around
me
this
is
why
mademoiselle
said
he
smiling
to
montalais
i
never
would
divulge
the
secret
of
the
visits
of
my
friend
to
your
apartment
obtain
from
madamefrom
madame
who
is
so
clement
and
so
generousobtain
her
pardon
for
you
whom
she
has
just
surprised
also
you
are
both
free
love
each
other
be
happy
the
princess
felt
for
a
moment
a
despair
that
cannot
be
described
it
was
repugnant
to
her
notwithstanding
the
exquisite
delicacy
which
raoul
had
exhibited
to
feel
herself
at
the
mercy
of
one
who
had
discovered
such
an
indiscretion
it
was
equally
repugnant
to
her
to
accept
the
evasion
offered
by
this
delicate
deception
agitated
nervous
she
struggled
against
the
double
stings
of
these
two
troubles
raoul
comprehended
her
position
and
came
once
more
to
her
aid
bending
his
knee
before
her
madame
said
he
in
a
low
voice
in
two
days
i
shall
be
far
from
paris
in
a
fortnight
i
shall
be
far
from
france
where
i
shall
never
be
seen
again
are
you
going
away
then
said
she
with
great
delight
with
m
de
beaufort
into
africa
cried
de
guiche
in
his
turn
you
raouloh
my
friendinto
africa
where
everybody
dies
and
forgetting
everything
forgetting
that
that
forgetfulness
itself
compromised
the
princess
more
eloquently
than
his
presence
ingrate
said
he
and
you
have
not
even
consulted
me
and
he
embraced
him
during
which
time
montalais
had
led
away
madame
and
disappeared
herself
raoul
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
said
with
a
smile
i
have
been
dreaming
then
warmly
to
guiche
who
by
degrees
absorbed
him
my
friend
said
he
i
conceal
nothing
from
you
who
are
the
elected
of
my
heart
i
am
going
to
seek
death
in
yonder
country
your
secret
will
not
remain
in
my
breast
more
than
a
year
oh
raoul
a
man
do
you
know
what
is
my
thought
count
this
is
iti
shall
live
more
vividly
being
buried
beneath
the
earth
than
i
have
lived
for
this
month
past
we
are
christians
my
friend
and
if
such
sufferings
were
to
continue
i
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
safety
of
my
soul
de
guiche
was
anxious
to
raise
objections
not
one
word
more
on
my
account
said
raoul
but
advice
to
you
dear
friend
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
is
of
much
greater
importance
what
is
that
without
doubt
you
risk
much
more
than
i
do
because
you
love
oh
it
is
a
joy
so
sweet
to
me
to
be
able
to
speak
to
you
thus
well
then
de
guiche
beware
of
montalais
what
of
that
kind
friend
she
was
the
friend
ofher
you
know
of
she
ruined
her
by
pride
you
are
mistaken
and
now
when
she
has
ruined
her
she
would
ravish
from
her
the
only
thing
that
renders
that
woman
excusable
in
my
eyes
what
is
that
her
love
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
there
is
a
plot
formed
against
her
who
is
the
mistress
of
the
kinga
plot
formed
in
the
very
house
of

can
you
think
so
i
am
certain
of
it
by
montalais
take
her
as
the
least
dangerous
of
the
enemies
i
dread
forthe
other
explain
yourself
clearly
my
friend
and
if
i
can
understand
you
in
two
words
madame

been
long
jealous
of
the
king

you

for
some
time
this
unfortunate
young

half
mad
with
despair
till
there
passed
through
his
heart
something
like
remorse
at

suppressed
his
feverish

of
the
grocer
in
great
confusion
but
it
was
not
the
encumberment
of
a
lucky
sale
or
that
of
an
arrival
of
goods
planchet
was
not
enthroned
as
usual
on
sacks
and
barrels
no
a
young
man
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
and
another
with
an
accountbook
in
his
hand
were
setting
down
a
number
of
figures
whilst
a
third
counted
and
weighed
an
inventory
was
being
taken
athos
who
had
no
knowledge
of
commercial
matters
felt
himself
a
little
embarrassed
by
material
obstacles
and
the
majesty
of
those
who
were
thus
employed
he
saw
several
customers
sent
away
and
asked
himself
whether
he
who
came
to
buy
nothing
would
not
be
more
properly
deemed
importunate
he
therefore
asked
very
politely
if
he
could
see
m
planchet
the
reply
quite
carelessly
given
was
that
m
planchet
was
packing
his
trunks
these
words
surprised
athos
what
his
trunks
said
he
is
m
planchet
going
away
yes
monsieur
directly
then
if
you
please
inform
him
that
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
desires
to
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
at
the
mention
of
the
comtes
name
one
of
the
young
men
no
doubt
accustomed
to
hear
it
pronounced
with
respect
immediately
went
to
inform
planchet
it
was
at
this
moment
that
raoul
after
his
painful
scene
with
montalais
and
de
guiche
arrived
at
the
grocers
house
planchet
left
his
job
directly
he
received
the
comtes
message
ah
monsieur
le
comte
exclaimed
he
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
what
good
star
brings
you
here
my
dear
planchet
said
athos
pressing
the
hand
of
his
son
whose
sad
look
he
silently
observedwe
are
come
to
learn
of
youbut
in
what
confusion
do
i
find
you
you
are
as
white
as
a
miller
where
have
you
been
rummaging
ah
diable
take
care
monsieur
dont
come
near
me
till
i
have
well
shaken
myself
what
for
flour
or
dust
only
whiten
no
no
what
you
see
on
my
arms
is
arsenic
arsenic
yes
i
am
taking
my
precautions
against
rats
ay
i
suppose
in
an
establishment
like
this
rats
play
a
conspicuous
part
it
is
not
with
this
establishment
i
concern
myself
monsieur
le
comte
the
rats
have
robbed
me
of
more
here
than
they
will
ever
rob
me
of
again
what
do
you
mean
why
you
may
have
observed
monsieur
my
inventory
is
being
taken
are
you
leaving
trade
then
eh
mon
dieu
yes
i
have
disposed
of
my
business
to
one
of
my
young
men
bah
you
are
rich
then
i
suppose
monsieur
i
have
taken
a
dislike
to
the
city
i
dont
know
whether
it
is
because
i
am
growing
old
and
as
m
dartagnan
one
day
said
when
we
grow
old
we
more
often
think
of
the
adventures
of
our
youth
but
for
some
time
past
i
have
felt
myself
attracted
towards
the
country
and
gardening
i
was
a
countryman
formerly
and
planchet
marked
this
confession
with
a
rather
pretentious
laugh
for
a
man
making
profession
of
humility
athos
made
a
gesture
of
approval
and
then
added
you
are
going
to
buy
an
estate
then
i
have
bought
one
monsieur
ah
that
is
still
better
a
little
house
at
fontainebleau
with
something
like
twenty
acres
of
land
round
it
very
well
planchet
accept
my
compliments
on
your
acquisition
but
monsieur
we
are
not
comfortable
here
the
cursed
dust
makes
you
cough
corbleu
i
do
not
wish
to
poison
the
most
worthy
gentleman
in
the
kingdom
athos
did
not
smile
at
this
little
pleasantry
which
planchet
had
aimed
at
him
in
order
to
try
his
strength
in
mundane
facetiousness
yes
said
athos
let
us
have
a
little
talk
by
ourselvesin
your
own
room
for
example
you
have
a
room
have
you
not
certainly
monsieur
le
comte
upstairs
perhaps
and
athos
seeing
planchet
a
little
embarrassed
wished
to
relieve
him
by
going
first
it
isbut
said
planchet
hesitating
athos
was
mistaken
in
the
cause
of
this
hesitation
and
attributing
it
to
a
fear
the
grocer
might
have
of
offering
humble
hospitality
never
mind
never
mind
said
he
still
going
up
the
dwelling
of
a
tradesman
in
this
quarter
is
not
expected
to
be
a
palace
come
on
raoul
nimbly
preceded
him
and
entered
first
two
cries
were
heard
simultaneouslywe
may
say
three
one
of
these
cries
dominated
the
others
it
emanated
from
a
woman
another
proceeded
from
the
mouth
of
raoul
it
was
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
it
than
he
shut
the
door
sharply
the
third
was
from
fright
it
came
from
planchet
i
ask
your
pardon
added
he
madame
is
dressing
raoul
had
no
doubt
seen
that
what
planchet
said
was
true
for
he
turned
round
to
go
downstairs
again
madame
said
athos
oh
pardon
me
planchet
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
upstairs
it
is
truchen
added
planchet
blushing
a
little
it
is
whoever
you
please
my
good
planchet
but
pardon
my
rudeness
no
no
go
up
now
gentlemen
we
will
do
no
such
thing
said
athos
oh
madame
having
notice
has
had
time
no
planchet
farewell
eh
gentlemen
you
would
not
disoblige
me
by
thus
standing
on
the
staircase
or
by
going
away
without
having
sat
down
if
we
had
known
you
had
a
lady
upstairs
replied
athos
with
his
customary
coolness
we
would
have
asked
permission
to
pay
our
respects
to
her
planchet
was
so
disconcerted
by
this
little
extravagance
that
he
forced
the
passage
and
himself
opened
the
door
to
admit
the
comte
and
his
son
truchen
was
quite
dressed
in
the
costume
of
the
shopkeepers
wife
rich
yet
coquettish
german
eyes
attacking
french
eyes
she
left
the
apartment
after
two
courtesies
and
went
down
into
the
shopbut
not
without
having
listened
at
the
door
to
know
what
planchets
gentlemen
visitors
would
say
of
her
athos
suspected
that
and
therefore
turned
the
conversation
accordingly
planchet
on
his
part
was
burning
to
give
explanations
which
athos
avoided
but
as
certain
tenacities
are
stronger
than
others
athos
was
forced
to
hear
planchet
recite
his
idyls
of
felicity
translated
into
a
language
more
chaste
than
that
of
longus
so
planchet
related
how
truchen
had
charmed
the
years
of
his
advancing
age
and
brought
good
luck
to
his
business
as
ruth
did
to
boaz
you
want
nothing
now
then
but
heirs
to
your
property
if
i
had
one
he
would
have
three
hundred
thousand
livres
said
planchet
humph
you
must
have
one
then
said
athos
phlegmatically
if
only
to
prevent
your
little
fortune
being
lost
this
word
little
fortune
placed
planchet
in
his
rank
like
the
voice
of
the
sergeant
when
planchet
was
but
a
piqueur
in
the
regiment
of
piedmont
in
which
rochefort
had
placed
him
athos
perceived
that
the
grocer
would
marry
truchen
and
in
spite
of
fate
establish
a
family
this
appeared
the
more
evident
to
him
when
he
learned
that
the
young
man
to
whom
planchet
was
selling
the
business
was
her
cousin
having
heard
all
that
was
necessary
of
the
happy
prospects
of
the
retiring
grocer
what
is
m
dartagnan
about
said
he
he
is
not
at
the
louvre
ah
monsieur
le
comte
monsieur
dartagnan
has
disappeared
disappeared
said
athos
in
surprise
oh
monsieur
we
know
what
that
means
but
i
do
not
know
whenever
m
dartagnan
disappears
it
is
always
for
some
mission
or
some
great
affair
has
he
said
anything
to
you
about
it
never
you
were
acquainted
with
his
departure
for
england
formerly
were
you
not
on
account
of
the
speculation
said
planchet
heedlessly
the
speculation
i
mean
interrupted
planchet
quite
confused
well
well
neither
your
affairs
nor
those
of
your
master
are
in
question
the
interest
we
take
in
him
alone
has
induced
me
to
apply
to
you
since
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
is
not
here
and
as
we
cannot
learn
from
you
where
we
are
likely
to
find
m
dartagnan
we
will
take
our
leave
of
you
au
revoir
planchet
au
revoir
let
us
be
gone
raoul
monsieur
le
comte
i
wish
i
were
able
to
tell
you
oh
not
at
all
i
am
not
the
man
to
reproach
a
servant
with
discretion
this
word
servant
struck
rudely
on
the
ears
of
the
demimillionnaire
planchet
but
natural
respect
and
bonhomie
prevailed
over
pride
there
is
nothing
indiscreet
in
telling
you
monsieur
le
comte
m
dartagnan
came
here
the
other
day
aha
and
remained
several
hours
consulting
a
geographical
chart
you
are
right
then
my
friend
say
no
more
about
it
and
the
chart
is
there
as
a
proof
added
planchet
who
went
to
fetch
from
the
neighboring
wall
where
it
was
suspended
by
a
twist
forming
a
triangle
with
the
bar
of
the
window
to
which
it
was
fastened
the
plan
consulted
by
the
captain
on
his
last
visit
to
planchet
this
plan
which
he
brought
to
the
comte
was
a
map
of
france
upon
which
the
practiced
eye
of
that
gentleman
discovered
an
itinerary
marked
out
with
small
pins
wherever
a
pin
was
missing
a
hole
denoted
its
having
been
there
athos
by
following
with
his
eye
the
pins
and
holes
saw
that
dartagnan
had
taken
the
direction
of
the
south
and
gone
as
far
as
the
mediterranean
towards
toulon
it
was
near
cannes
that
the
marks
and
the
punctured
places
ceased
the
comte
de
la
fere
puzzled
his
brains
for
some
time
to
divine
what
the
musketeer
could
be
going
to
do
at
cannes
and
what
motive
could
have
led
him
to
examine
the
banks
of
the
var
the
reflections
of
athos
suggested
nothing
his
accustomed
perspicacity
was
at
fault
raouls
researches
were
not
more
successful
than
his
fathers
never
mind
said
the
young
man
to
the
comte
who
silently
and
with
his
finger
had
made
him
understand
the
route
of
dartagnan
we
must
confess
that
there
is
a
providence
always
occupied
in
connecting
our
destiny
with
that
of
m
dartagnan
there
he
is
on
the
coast
of
cannes
and
you
monsieur
will
at
least
conduct
me
as
far
as
toulon
be
assured
that
we
shall
meet
with
him
more
easily
upon
our
route
than
on
this
map
then
taking
leave
of
planchet
who
was
scolding
his
shopmen
even
the
cousin
of
truchen
his
successor
the
gentlemen
set
out
to
pay
a
visit
to
m
de
beaufort
on
leaving
the
grocers
shop
they
saw
a
coach
the
future
depository
of
the
charms
of
mademoiselle
truchen
and
planchets
bags
of

raoul
in

melancholy

evidently
neither

had
anything
to

of

they

born
a
prince
and
of
a
blood
which
is
not
shed
upon
scaffolds
unless
by
the
decree
of
peoplesa
prince
who
had
kept
up
a
grand
style
of
living
how
did
he
maintain
his
horses
his
people
and
his
table
nobody
knew
himself
less
than
others
only
there
were
then
privileges
for
the
sons
of
kings
to
whom
nobody
refused
to
become
a
creditor
whether
from
respect
or
the
persuasion
that
they
would
some
day
be
paid
athos
and
raoul
found
the
mansion
of
the
duke
in
as
much
confusion
as
that
of
planchet
the
duke
likewise
was
making
his
inventory
that
is
to
say
he
was
distributing
to
his
friends
everything
of
value
he
had
in
his
house
owing
nearly
two
millionsan
enormous
amount
in
those
daysm
de
beaufort
had
calculated
that
he
could
not
set
out
for
africa
without
a
good
round
sum
and
in
order
to
find
that
sum
he
was
distributing
to
his
old
creditors
plate
arms
jewels
and
furniture
which
was
more
magnificent
in
selling
it
and
brought
him
back
double
in
fact
how
could
a
man
to
whom
ten
thousand
livres
were
owing
refuse
to
carry
away
a
present
worth
six
thousand
enhanced
in
estimation
from
having
belonged
to
a
descendant
of
henry
iv
and
how
after
having
carried
away
that
present
could
he
refuse
ten
thousand
livres
more
to
this
generous
noble
this
then
was
what
had
happened
the
duke
had
no
longer
a
dwellinghousethat
had
become
useless
to
an
admiral
whose
place
of
residence
is
his
ship
he
had
no
longer
need
of
superfluous
arms
when
he
was
placed
amidst
his
cannons
no
more
jewels
which
the
sea
might
rob
him
of
but
he
had
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
crowns
fresh
in
his
coffers
and
throughout
the
house
there
was
a
joyous
movement
of
people
who
believed
they
were
plundering
monseigneur
the
prince
had
in
a
supreme
degree
the
art
of
making
happy
the
creditors
most
to
be
pitied
every
distressed
man
every
empty
purse
found
in
him
patience
and
sympathy
for
his
position
to
some
he
said
i
wish
i
had
what
you
have
i
would
give
it
you
and
to
others
i
have
but
this
silver
ewer
it
is
worth
at
least
five
hundred
livrestake
it
the
effect
of
which
wasso
truly
is
courtesy
a
current
paymentthat
the
prince
constantly
found
means
to
renew
his
creditors
this
time
he
used
no
ceremony
it
might
be
called
a
general
pillage
he
gave
up
everything
the
oriental
fable
of
the
poor
arab
who
carried
away
from
the
pillage
of
palace
a
kettle
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
concealed
a
bag
of
gold
and
whom
everybody
allowed
to
pass
without
jealousythis
fable
had
become
a
truth
in
the
princes
mansion
many
contractors
paid
themselves
upon
the
offices
of
the
duke
thus
the
provision
department
who
plundered
the
clothespresses
and
the
harnessrooms
attached
very
little
value
to
things
which
tailors
and
saddlers
set
great
store
by
anxious
to
carry
home
to
their
wives
presents
given
them
by
monseigneur
many
were
seen
bounding
joyously
along
under
the
weight
of
earthen
jars
and
bottles
gloriously
stamped
with
the
arms
of
the
prince
m
de
beaufort
finished
by
giving
away
his
horses
and
the
hay
from
his
lofts
he
made
more
than
thirty
happy
with
kitchen
utensils
and
thirty
more
with
the
contents
of
his
cellar
still
further
all
these
people
went
away
with
the
conviction
that
m
de
beaufort
only
acted
in
this
manner
to
prepare
for
a
new
fortune
concealed
beneath
the
arabs
tents
they
repeated
to
each
other
while
pillaging
his
hotel
that
he
was
sent
to
gigelli
by
the
king
to
reconstruct
his
lost
fortunes
that
the
treasures
of
africa
would
be
equally
divided
between
the
admiral
and
the
king
of
france
that
these
treasures
consisted
in
mines
of
diamonds
or
other
fabulous
stones
the
gold
and
silver
mines
of
mount
atlas
did
not
even
obtain
the
honor
of
being
named
in
addition
to
the
mines
to
be
workedwhich
could
not
be
begun
till
after
the
campaignthere
would
be
the
booty
made
by
the
army
m
de
beaufort
would
lay
his
hands
on
all
the
riches
pirates
had
robbed
christendom
of
since
the
battle
of
lepanto
the
number
of
millions
from
these
sources
defied
calculation
why
then
should
he
who
was
going
in
quest
of
such
treasure
set
any
store
by
the
poor
utensils
of
his
past
life
and
reciprocally
why
should
they
spare
the
property
of
him
who
spared
it
so
little
himself
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
athos
with
his
piercing
practiced
glance
saw
what
was
going
on
at
once
he
found
the
admiral
of
france
a
little
exalted
for
he
was
rising
from
a
table
of
fifty
covers
at
which
the
guests
had
drunk
long
and
deeply
to
the
prosperity
of
the
expedition
at
the
conclusion
of
which
repast
the
remains
with
the
dessert
had
been
given
to
the
servants
and
the
empty
dishes
and
plates
to
the
curious
the
prince
was
intoxicated
with
his
ruin
and
his
popularity
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
had
drunk
his
old
wine
to
the
health
of
his
wine
of
the
future
when
he
saw
athos
and
raoul
there
is
my
aidedecamp
being
brought
to
me
he
cried

to
find
a
passage
through
the
heaps
of
linen
and
plate
ah
step

said
the
duke
offering
a
full
glass
to
athos
the
latter
drank
it

scarcely
moistened
his
lips
here

your
commission
said
the
prince
to
raoul
i
had
prepared
it

le
prince
that

provisions

army

be
prepared
to
embark
in
a
fortnight
at
the
very
latest
that
shall
be
done
monseigneur
the
present
order
gives
you
the
right
to
visit
and
search
all
the
isles
along
the
coast
you
will
there
make
the
enrolments
and
levies

may
want

me
yes
monsieur

an
active
man
and
will
work
freely

much
money
i
hope
not
monseigneur
but
i
am
sure
you
will
my
intendant
has
prepared
the
orders
of
a
thousand
livres
drawn
upon
the
cities
of

south

will
give

hundred

monseigneur
war
is
to
be
waged
among
the
arabs
with
gold
as
well
as
lead
i
wish
to
try
the
contrary
replied
the
duke
and
then
you
are
acquainted
with
my
ideas
upon
the
expeditionplenty
of
noise
plenty
of
fire
and
if
so
it
must
be
i
shall
disappear
in
the
smoke
having
spoken
thus
m
de
beaufort
began
to
laugh
but
his
mirth
was
not
reciprocated
by
athos
and
raoul
he
perceived
this
at
once
ah
said
he
with
the
courteous
egotism
of
his
rank
and
age
you
are
such
people
as
a
man
should
not
see
after
dinner
you
are
cold
stiff
and
dry
when
i
am
all
fire
suppleness
and
wine
no
devil
take
me
i
should
always
see
you
fasting
vicomte
and
you
comte
if
you
wear
such
a
face
as
that
you
shall
see
me
no
more
he
said
this
pressing
the
hand
of
athos
who
replied
with
a
smile
monseigneur
do
not
talk
so
grandly
because
you
happen
to
have
plenty
of
money
i
predict
that
within
a
month
you
will
be
dry
stiff
and
cold
in
presence
of
your
strongbox
and
that
then
having
raoul
at
your
elbow
fasting
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
him
gay
animated
and
generous
because
he
will
have
some
new
crowns
to
offer
you
god
grant
it
may
be
so
cried
the
delighted
duke
comte
stay
with
me
no
i
shall
go
with
raoul
the
mission
with
which
you
charge
him
is
a
troublesome
and
difficult
one
alone
it
would
be
too
much
for
him
to
execute
you
do
not
observe
monseigneur
you
have
given
him
command
of
the
first
order
bah
and
in
your
naval
arrangements
too
that
may
be
true
but
one
finds
that
such
fine
young
fellows
as
your
son
generally
do
all
that
is
required
of
them
monseigneur
i
believe
you
will
find
nowhere
so
much
zeal
and
intelligence
so
much
real
bravery
as
in
raoul
but
if
he
failed
to
arrange
your
embarkation
you
would
only
meet
the
fate
that
you
deserve
humph
you
are
scolding
me
then
monseigneur
to
provision
a
fleet
to
assemble
a
flotilla
to
enroll
your
maritime
force
would
take
an
admiral
a
year
raoul
is
a
cavalry
officer
and
you
allow
him
a
fortnight
i
tell
you
he
will
do
it
he
may
but
i
will
go
and
help
him
to
be
sure
you
will
i
reckoned
upon
you
and
still
further
believe
that
when
we
are
once
at
toulon
you
will
not
let
him
depart
alone
oh
said
athos
shaking
his
head
patience
patience
monseigneur
permit
us
to
take
our
leave
begone
then
and
may
my
good
luck
attend
you
adieu
monseigneur
and
may
your
own
good
luck
attend
you
likewise
here
is
an
expedition
admirably
commenced
said
athos
to
his
son
no
provisionsno
store
flotilla
what
can
be
done
thus
humph
murmured
raoul
if
all
are
going
to
do
as
i
am
provisions
will
not
be
wanted
monsieur
replied
athos
sternly
do
not
be
unjust
and
senseless
in
your
egotism
or
your
grief
whichever
you
please
to
call
it
if
you
set
out
for
this
war
solely
with
the
intention
of
getting
killed
therein
you
stand
in
need
of
nobody
and
it
was
scarcely
worth
while
to
recommend
you
to
m
de
beaufort
but
when
you
have
been
introduced
to
the
prime
commandantwhen
you
have
accepted
the
responsibility
of
a
post
in
his
army
the
question
is
no
longer
about
you
but
about
all
those
poor
soldiers
who
as
well
as
you
have
hearts
and
bodies
who
will
weep
for
their
country
and
endure
all
the
necessities
of
their
condition
remember
raoul
that
officers
are
ministers
as
useful
to
the
world
as
priests
and
that
they
ought
to
have
more
charity
monsieur
i
know
it
and
have
practiced
it
i
would
have
continued
to
do
so
still
but
you
forget
also
that
you
are
of
a
country
that
is
proud
of
its
military
glory
go
and
die
if
you
like
but
do
not
die
without
honor
and
without
advantage
to
france
cheer
up
raoul
do
not
let
my
words
grieve
you
i
love
you
and
wish
to
see
you
perfect
i
love
your
reproaches
monsieur
said
the
young
man
mildly
they
alone
may
cure
me
because
they
prove
to
me
that
some
one
loves
me
still
and
now
raoul
let
us
be
off
the
weather
is
so
fine
the
heavens
so
clear
those
heavens
which
we
always
find
above
our
heads
which
you
will
see
more
clear
still
at
gigelli
and
which
will
speak
to
you
of
me
there
as
they
speak
to
me
here
of
god
the
two
gentlemen
after
having
agreed
on
this
point
talked
over
the
wild
freaks
of
the
duke
convinced
that
france
would
be
served
in
a
very
incomplete
manner
as
regarded
both
spirit
and
practice
in
the
ensuing
expedition
and
having
summed
up
the
ducal
policy
under
the
one
word
vanity
they
set
forward
in
obedience
rather
to
their
will
than
destiny
the
sacrifice
was
half
accomplished

preserving
an
incognito
on
his
route
for
athos
derived
from
his
inquiries
an
assurance
that
such
a
cavalier
as
he
described
had
exchanged
his
horse
for
a
wellclosed
carriage
on
quitting
avignon
raoul
was
much
affected
at
not
meeting
with
dartagnan
his
affectionate
heart
longed
to
take
a
farewell
and
received
consolation
from
that
heart
of
steel
athos
knew
from
experience
that
dartagnan
became
impenetrable
when
engaged
in
any
serious
affair
whether
on
his
own
account
or
on
the
service
of
the
king
he
even
feared
to
offend
his
friend
or
thwart
him
by
too
pressing
inquiries
and
yet
when
raoul
commenced
his
labor
of
classing
the
flotilla
and
got
together
the
chalands
and
lighters
to
send
them
to
toulon
one
of
the
fishermen
told
the
comte
that
his
boat
had
been
laid
up
to
refit
since
a
trip
he
had
made
on
account
of
a
gentleman
who
was
in
great
haste
to
embark
athos
believing
that
this
man
was
telling
a
falsehood
in
order
to
be
left
at
liberty
to
fish
and
so
gain
more
money
when
all
his
companions
were
gone
insisted
upon
having
the
details
the
fisherman
informed
him
that
six
days
previously
a
man
had
come
in
the
night
to
hire
his
boat
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
island
of
st
honnorat
the
price
was
agreed
upon
but
the
gentleman
had
arrived
with
an
immense
carriage
case
which
he
insisted
upon
embarking
in
spite
of
the
many
difficulties
that
opposed
the
operation
the
fisherman
wished
to
retract
he
had
even
threatened
but
his
threats
had
procured
him
nothing
but
a
shower
of
blows
from
the
gentlemans
cane
which
fell
upon
his
shoulders
sharp
and
long
swearing
and
grumbling
he
had
recourse
to
the
syndic
of
his
brotherhood
at
antibes
who
administer
justice
among
themselves
and
protect
each
other
but
the
gentleman
had
exhibited
a
certain
paper
at
sight
of
which
the
syndic
bowing
to
the
very
ground
enjoined
obedience
from
the
fisherman
and
abused
him
for
having
been
refractory
they
then
departed
with
the
freight
but
all
this
does
not
tell
us
said
athos
how
you
injured
your
boat
this
is
the
way
i
was
steering
towards
st
honnorat
as
the
gentleman
desired
me
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
pretended
that
i
could
not
pass
to
the
south
of
the
abbey
and
why
not
because
monsieur
there
is
in
front
of
the
square
tower
of
the
benedictines
towards
the
southern
point
the
bank
of
the
moines
a
rock
asked
athos
level
with
the
water
but
below
water
a
dangerous
passage
yet
one
i
have
cleared
a
thousand
times
the
gentleman
required
me
to
land
him
at
saintemarguerites
well
well
monsieur
cried
the
fisherman
with
his
provencal
accent
a
man
is
a
sailor
or
he
is
not
he
knows
his
course
or
he
is
nothing
but
a
freshwater
lubber
i
was
obstinate
and
wished
to
try
the
channel
the
gentleman
took
me
by
the
collar
and
told
me
quietly
he
would
strangle
me
my
mate
armed
himself
with
a
hatchet
and
so
did
i
we
had
the
affront
of
the
night
before
to
pay
him
out
for
but
the
gentleman
drew
his
sword
and
used
it
in
such
an
astonishingly
rapid
manner
that
we
neither
of
us
could
get
near
him
i
was
about
to
hurl
my
hatchet
at
his
head
and
i
had
a
right
to
do
so
hadnt
i
monsieur
for
a
sailor
aboard
is
master
as
a
citizen
is
in
his
chamber
i
was
going
then
in
selfdefense
to
cut
the
gentleman
in
two
when
all
at
oncebelieve
me
or
not
monsieurthe
great
carriage
case
opened
of
itself
i
dont
know
how
and
there
came
out
of
it
a
sort
of
a
phantom
his
head
covered
with
a
black
helmet
and
a
black
mask
something
terrible
to
look
upon
which
came
towards
me
threatening
with
its
fist
and
that
was
said
athos
that
was
the
devil
monsieur
for
the
gentleman
with
great
glee
cried
out
on
seeing
him
ah
thank
you
monseigneur
a
most
strange
story
murmured
the
comte
looking
at
raoul
and
what
did
you
do
asked
the
latter
of
the
fisherman
you
must
know
monsieur
that
two
poor
men
such
as
we
are
could
be
no
match
for
two
gentlemen
but
when
one
of
them
turned
out
to
be
the
devil
we
had
no
earthly
chance
my
companion
and
i
did
not
stop
to
consult
one
another
we
made
but
one
jump
into
the
sea
for
we
were
within
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
of
the
shore
well
and
then
why
and
then
monseigneur
as
there
was
a
little
wind
from
the
southwest
the
boat
drifted
into
the
sands
of
saintemarguerites
ohbut
the
travelers
bah
you
need
not
be
uneasy
about
them
it
was
pretty
plain
that
one
was
the
devil
and
protected
the
other
for
when
we
recovered
the
boat
after
she
got
afloat
again
instead
of
finding
these
two
creatures
injured
by
the
shock
we
found
nothing
not
even
the
carriage
or
the
case
very
strange
very
strange
repeated
the
comte
but
after
that
what
did
you
do
my
friend
i
made
my
complaint
to
the
governor
of
saintemarguerites
who
brought
my
finger
under
my
nose
by
telling
me
if
i
plagued
him
with
such
silly
stories
he
would
have
me
flogged
what
did
the
governor
himself
say
so
yes
monsieur
and
yet
my
boat
was
injured
seriously
injured
for
the
prow
is
left
upon
the
point
of
saintemarguerites
and
the
carpenter
asks
a
hundred
and
twenty
livres
to
repair
it
very
well
replied
raoul
you
will
be
exempted
from
the
service
go
we
will
go
to
saintemarguerites
shall
we
said
the
comte
to
bragelonne
as
the
man
walked
away
yes
monsieur
for
there
is
something
to
be
cleared
up
that
man
does
not
seem
to
me
to
have
told
the
truth
nor
to
me
either
raoul
the
story
of
the
masked
man
and
the
carriage
having
disappeared
may
be
told
to
conceal
some
violence
these
fellows
have
committed
upon
their
passengers
in
the
open
sea
to
punish
him
for
his
persistence
in
embarking
i
formed
the
same
suspicion
the
carriage
was
more
likely
to
contain
property
than
a
man
we
shall
see
to
that
raoul
the
gentleman
very
much
resembles
dartagnan
i
recognize
his
methods
of
proceeding
alas
we
are
no
longer
the
young
invincibles
of
former
days
who
knows
whether
the
hatchet
or
the
iron
bar
of
this
miserable
coaster
has
not
succeeded
in
doing
that
which
the
best
blades
of
europe
balls
and
bullets
have
not
been
able
to
do
in
forty
years
that
same
day
they
set
out
for
saintemarguerites
on
board
a
chassemaree
come
from
toulon
under
orders
the
impression
they
experienced
on
landing
was
a
singularly
pleasing
one
the
island
seemed
loaded
with
flowers
and
fruits
in
its
cultivated
part
it
served
as
a
garden
for
the
governor
orange
pomegranate
and
fig
trees
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
their
golden
or
purple
fruits
all
round
this
garden
in
the
uncultivated
parts
red
partridges
ran
about
in
conveys
among
the
brambles
and
tufts
of
junipers
and
at
every
step
of
the
comte
and
raoul
a
terrified
rabbit
quitted
his
thyme
and
heath
to
scuttle
away
to
the
burrow
in
fact
this
fortunate
isle
was
uninhabited
flat
offering
nothing
but
a
tiny
bay
for
the
convenience
of
embarkation
and
under
the
protection
of
the
governor
who
went
shares
with
them
smugglers
made
use
of
it
as
a
provisional
entrepot
at
the
expense
of
not
killing
the
game
or
devastating
the
garden
with
this
compromise
the
governor
was
in
a
situation
to
be
satisfied
with
a
garrison
of
eight
men
to
guard
his
fortress
in
which
twelve
cannons
accumulated
coats
of
moldy
green
the
governor
was
a
sort
of
happy
farmer
harvesting
wines
figs
oil
and
oranges
preserving
his
citrons
and
cedrates
in
the
sun
of
his
casemates
the
fortress
encircled
by
a
deep
ditch
its
only
guardian
arose
like
three
heads
upon
turrets
connected
with
each
other
by
terraces
covered
with
moss
athos
and
raoul
wandered
for
some
time
round
the
fences
of
the
garden
without
finding
any
one
to
introduce
them
to
the
governor
they
ended
by
making
their
own
way
into
the
garden
it
was
at
the
hottest
time
of
the
day
each
living
thing
sought
its
shelter
under
grass
or
stone
the
heavens
spread
their
fiery
veils
as
if
to
stifle
all
noises
to
envelop
all
existences
the
rabbit
under
the
broom
the
fly
under
the
leaf
slept
as
the
wave
did
beneath
the
heavens
athos
saw
nothing
living
but
a
soldier
upon
the
terrace
beneath
the
second
and
third
court
who
was
carrying
a
basket
of
provisions
on
his
head
this
man
returned
almost
immediately
without
his
basket
and
disappeared
in
the
shade
of
his
sentrybox
athos
supposed
he
must
have
been
carrying
dinner
to
some
one
and
after
having
done
so
returned
to
dine
himself
all
at
once
they
heard
some
one
call
out
and
raising
their
heads
perceived
in
the
frame
of
the
bars
of
the
window
something
of
a
white
color
like
a
hand
that
was
waved
backwards
and
forwardssomething
shining
like
a
polished
weapon
struck
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
before
they
were
able
to
ascertain
what
it
was
a
luminous
train
accompanied
by
a
hissing
sound
in
the
air
called
their
attention
from
the
donjon
to
the
ground
a
second
dull
noise
was
heard
from
the
ditch
and
raoul
ran
to
pick
up
a
silver
plate
which
was
rolling
along
the
dry
sand
the
hand
that
had
thrown
this
plate
made
a
sign
to
the
two
gentlemen
and
then
disappeared
athos
and
raoul
approaching
each
other
commenced
an
attentive
examination
of
the
dusty
plate
and
they
discovered
in
characters
traced
upon
the
bottom
of
it
with
the
point
of
a
knife
this
inscription
i
am
the
brother
of
the
king
of
francea
prisoner
todaya
madman
tomorrow
french
gentlemen
and
christians
pray
to
god
for
the
soul
and
the
reason
of
the
son
of
your
old
rulers
the
plate
fell
from
the
hands
of
athos
whilst
raoul
was
endeavoring
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
these
dismal
words
at
the
same
moment
they
heard
a
cry
from
the
top
of
the
donjon
quick
as
lightning
raoul
bent
down
his
head
and
forced
down
that
of
his
father
likewise
a
musketbarrel
glittered
from
the
crest
of
the
wall
a
white
smoke
floated
like
a
plume
from
the
mouth
of
the
musket
and
a
ball
was
flattened
against
a
stone
within
six
inches
of
the
two
gentlemen
cordieu
cried
athos
what
are
people
assassinated
here
come
down
cowards
as
you
are
yes
come
down
cried
raoul
furiously
shaking
his
fist
at
the
castle
one
of
the
assailantshe
who
was
about
to
firereplied
to
these
cries
by
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
as
his
companion
who
wished
to
continue
the
attack
had
reseized
his
loaded
musket
he
who
had
cried
out
threw
up
the
weapon
and
the
ball
flew
into
the
air
athos
and
raoul
seeing
them
disappear
from
the
platform
expected
they
would
come
down
to
them
and
waited
with
a
firm
demeanor
five
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
a
stroke
upon
a
drum
called
the
eight
soldiers
of
the
garrison
to
arms
and
they
showed
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
with
their
muskets
in
hand
at
the
head
of
these
men
was
an
officer
whom
athos
and
raoul
recognized
as
the
one
who
had
fired
the
first
musket
the
man
ordered
the
soldiers
to
make
ready
we
are
going
to
be
shot
cried
raoul
but
sword
in
hand
at
least
let
us
leap
the
ditch
we
shall
kill
at
least
two
of
these
scoundrels
when
their
muskets
are
empty
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
raoul
was
springing
forward
followed
by
athos
when
a
wellknown
voice
resounded
behind
them
athos
raoul
dartagnan
replied
the
two
gentlemen
recover
arms
mordioux
cried
the
captain
to
the
soldiers
i
was
sure
i
could
not
be
mistaken
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
asked
athos
what
were
we
to
be
shot
without
warning
it
was
i
who
was
going
to
shoot
you
and
if
the
governor
missed
you
i
should
not
have
missed
you
my
dear
friends
how
fortunate
it
is
that
i
am
accustomed
to
take
a
long
aim
instead
of
firing
at
the
instant
i
raise
my
weapon
i
thought
i
recognized
you
ah
my
dear
friends
how
fortunate
and
dartagnan
wiped
his
brow
for
he
had
run
fast
and
emotion
with
him
was
not
feigned
how
said
athos
and
is
the
gentleman
who
fired
at
us
the
governor
of
the
fortress
in
person
and
why
did
he
fire
at
us
what
have
we
done
to
him
pardieu
you
received
what
the
prisoner
threw
to
you
that
is
true
that
platethe
prisoner
has
written
something
on
it
has
he
not
yes
good
heavens
i
was
afraid
he
had
and
dartagnan
with
all
the
marks
of
mortal
disquietude
seized
the
plate
to
read
the
inscription
when
he
had
read
it
a
fearful
pallor
spread
across
his
countenance
oh
good
heavens
repeated
he
silencehere
is
the
governor
and
what
will
he
do
to
us
is
it
our
fault
it
is
true
then
said
athos
in
a
subdued
voice
it
is
true
silence
i
tell
yousilence
if
he
only
believes
you
can
read
if
he
only
suspects
you
have
understood
i
love
you
my
dear
friends
i
would
willingly
be
killed
for
you
but
but
said
athos
and
raoul
but
i
could
not
save
you
from
perpetual
imprisonment
if
i
saved
you
from
death
silence
then
silence
again
the
governor
came
up
having
crossed
the
ditch
upon
a
plank
bridge
well
said
he
to
dartagnan
what
stops
us
you
are
spaniardsyou
do
not
understand
a
word
of
french
said
the
captain
eagerly
to
his
friends
in
a
low
voice
well
replied
he
addressing
the
governor
i
was
right
these
gentlemen
are
two
spanish
captains
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
at
ypres
last
year
they
dont
know
a
word
of
french
ah
said
the
governor
sharply
and
yet
they
were
trying
to
read
the
inscription
on
the
plate
dartagnan
took
it
out
of
his
hands
effacing
the
characters
with
the
point
of
his
sword
how
cried
the
governor
what
are
you
doing
i
cannot
read
them
now
it
is
a
state
secret
replied
dartagnan
bluntly
and
as
you
know
that
according
to
the
kings
orders
it
is
under
the
penalty
of
death
any
one
should
penetrate
it
i
will
if
you
like
allow
you
to
read
it
and
have
you
shot
immediately
afterwards
during
this
apostrophehalf
serious
half
ironicalathos
and
raoul
preserved
the
coolest
most
unconcerned
silence
but
is
it
possible
said
the
governor
that
these
gentlemen
do
not
comprehend
at
least
some
words
suppose
they
do
if
they
do
understand
a
few
spoken
words
it
does
not
follow
that
they
should
understand
what
is
written
they
cannot
even
read
spanish
a
noble
spaniard
remember
ought
never
to
know
how
to
read
the
governor
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
these
explanations
but
he
was
still
tenacious
invite
these
gentlemen
to
come
to
the
fortress
said
he
that
i
will
willingly
do
i
was
about
to
propose
it
to
you
the
fact
is
the
captain
had
quite
another
idea
and
would
have
wished
his
friends
a
hundred
leagues
off
but
he
was
obliged
to
make
the
best
of
it
he
addressed
the
two
gentlemen
in
spanish
giving
them
a
polite
invitation
which
they
accepted
they
all
turned
towards
the
entrance
of
the
fort
and
the
incident
being
at
an
end
the
eight
soldiers
returned
to
their
delightful
leisure
for
a
moment
disturbed
by
this
unexpected
adventure
chapter
xxxii
captive
and
jailers
when
they
had
entered
the
fort
and
whilst
the
governor
was
making
some
preparations
for
the
reception
of
his
guests
come
said
athos
let
us
have
a
word
of
explanation
whilst
we
are
alone
it
is
simply
this
replied
the
musketeer
i
have
conducted
hither
a
prisoner
who
the
king
commands
shall
not
be
seen
you
came
here
he
has
thrown
something
to
you
through
the
lattice
of
his
window
i
was
at
dinner
with
the
governor
i
saw
the
object
thrown
and
i
saw
raoul
pick
it
up
it
does
not
take
long
to
understand
this
i
understood
it
and
i
thought
you
in
intelligence
with
my
prisoner
and
then
and
thenyou
commanded
us
to
be
shot
ma
foi
i
admit
it
but
if
i
was
the
first
to
seize
a
musket
fortunately
i
was
the
last
to
take
aim
at
you
if
you
had
killed
me
dartagnan
i
should
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
die
for
the
royal
house
of
france
and
it
would
be
an
honor
to
die
by
your
handyou
its
noblest
and
most
loyal
defender
what
the
devil
athos
do
you
mean
by
the
royal
house
stammered
dartagnan
you
dont
mean
that
you
a
wellinformed
and
sensible
man
can
place
any
faith
in
the
nonsense
written
by
an
idiot
i
do
believe
in
it
with
so
much
the
more
reason
my
dear
chevalier
from
your
having
orders
to
kill
all
those
who
do
believe
in
it
said
raoul
that
is
because
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeersbecause
every
calumny
however
absurd
it
may
be
has
the
almost
certain
chance
of
becoming
popular
no
dartagnan
replied
athos
promptly
but
because
the
king
is
not
willing
that
the
secret
of
his
family
should
transpire
among
the
people
and
cover
with
shame
the
executioners
of
the
son
of
louis
xiii
do
not
talk
in
such
a
childish
manner
athos
or
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
have
lost
your
senses
besides
explain
to
me
how
it
is
possible
louis
xiii
should
have
a
son
in
the
isle
of
saintemarguerite
a
son
whom
you
have
brought
hither
masked
in
a
fishingboat
said
athos
why
not
dartagnan
was
brought
to
a
pause
oh
said
he
whence
do
you
know
that
a
fishingboat
brought
you
to
saintemarguerites
with
the
carriage
containing
the
prisonerwith
a
prisoner
whom
you
styled
monseigneur
oh
i
am
acquainted
with
all
that
resumed
the
comte
dartagnan
bit
his
mustache
if
it
were
true
said
he
that
i
had
brought
hither
in
a
boat
and
with
a
carriage
a
masked
prisoner
nothing
proves
that
this
prisoner
must
be
a
princea
prince
of
the
house
of
france
ask
aramis
such
riddles
replied
athos
coolly
aramis
cried
the
musketeer
quite
at
a
stand
have
you
seen
aramis
after
his
discomfiture
at
vaux
yes
i
have
seen
aramis
a
fugitive
pursued
bewildered
ruined
and
aramis
has
told
me
enough
to
make
me
believe
in
the
complaints
this
unfortunate
young
prince
cut
upon
the
bottom
of
the
plate
dartagnans
head
sunk
on
his
breast
in
some
confusion
this
is
the
way
said
he
in
which
god
turns
to
nothing
that
which
men
call
wisdom
a
fine
secret
must
that
be
of
which
twelve
or
fifteen
persons
hold
the
tattered
fragments
athos
cursed
be
the
chance
which
has
brought
you
face
to
face
with
me
in
this
affair
for
now
well
said
athos
with
his
customary
mild
severity
is
your
secret
lost
because
i
know
it
consult
your
memory
my
friend
have
i
not
borne
secrets
heavier
than
this
you
have
never
borne
one
so
dangerous
replied
dartagnan
in
a
tone
of
sadness
i
have
something
like
a
sinister
idea
that
all
who
are
concerned
with
this
secret
will
die
and
die
unhappily
the
will
of
god
be
done
said
athos
but
here
is
your
governor
dartagnan
and
his
friends
immediately
resumed
their
parts
the
governor
suspicious
and
hard
behaved
towards
dartagnan
with
a
politeness
almost
amounting
to
obsequiousness
with
respect
to
the
travelers
he
contented
himself
with
offering
good
cheer
and
never
taking
his
eye
from
them
athos
and
raoul
observed
that
he
often
tried
to
embarrass
them
by
sudden
attacks
or
to
catch
them
off
their
guard
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
gave
him
the
least
advantage
what
dartagnan
had
said
was
probable
if
the
governor
did
not
believe
it
to
be
quite
true
they
rose
from
the
table
to
repose
awhile
what
is
this
mans
name
i
dont
like
the
looks
of
him
said
athos
to
dartagnan
in
spanish
de
saintmars
replied
the
captain
he
is
then
i
suppose
the
princes
jailer
eh
how
can
i
tell
i
may
be
kept
at
saintemarguerite
forever
oh
no
not
you
my
friend
i
am
in
the
situation
of
a
man
who
finds
a
treasure
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
he
would
like
to
carry
it
away
but
he
cannot
he
would
like
to
leave
it
but
he
dares
not
the
king
will
not
dare
to
recall
me
for
no
one
else
would
serve
him
as
faithfully
as
i
do
he
regrets
not
having
me
near
him
from
being
aware
that
no
one
would
be
of
so
much
service
near
his
person
as
myself
but
it
will
happen
as
it
may
please
god
but
observed
raoul
your
not
being
certain
proves
that
your
situation
here
is
provisional
and
you
will
return
to
paris
ask
these
gentlemen
interrupted
the
governor
what
was
their
purpose
in
coming
to
saintmarguerite
they
came
from
learning
there
was
a
convent
of
benedictines
at
saintehonnorat
which
is
considered
curious
and
from
being
told
there
was
excellent
shooting
in
the
island
that
is
quite
at
their
service
as
well
as
yours
replied
saintmars
dartagnan
politely
thanked
him
when
will
they
depart
added
the
governor
tomorrow
replied
dartagnan
m
de
saintmars
went
to
make
his
rounds
and
left
dartagnan
alone
with
the
pretended
spaniards
oh
exclaimed
the
musketeer
here
is
a
life
and
a
society
that
suits
me
very
little
i
command
this
man
and
he
bores
me
mordioux
come
let
us
have
a
shot
or
two
at
the
rabbits
the
walk
will
be
beautiful
and
not
fatiguing
the
whole
island
is
but
a
league
and
a
half
in
length
with
the
breadth
of
a
league
a
real
park
let
us
try
to
amuse
ourselves
as
you
please
dartagnan
not
for
the
sake
of
amusing
ourselves
but
to
gain
an
opportunity
for
talking
freely
dartagnan
made
a
sign
to
a
soldier
who
brought
the
gentlemen
some
guns
and
then
returned
to
the
fort
and
now
said
the
musketeer
answer
me
the
question
put
to
you
by
that
blacklooking
saintmars
what
did
you
come
to
do
at
the
lerin
isles
to
bid
you
farewell
bid
me
farewell
what
do
you
mean
by
that
is
raoul
going
anywhere
yes
then
i
will
lay
a
wager
it
is
with
m
de
beaufort
with
m
de
beaufort
it
is
my
dear
friend
you
always
guess
correctly
from
habit
whilst
the
two
friends
were
commencing
their
conversation
raoul
with
his
head
hanging
down
and
his
heart
oppressed
seated
himself
on
a
mossy
rock
his
gun
across
his
knees
looking
at
the
sealooking
at
the
heavens
and
listening
to
the
voice
of
his
soul
he
allowed
the
sportsmen
to
attain
a
considerable
distance
from
him
dartagnan
remarked
his
absence
he
has
not
recovered
the
blow
said
he
to
athos
he
is
struck
to
death
oh
your
fears
exaggerate
i
hope
raoul
is
of
a
tempered
nature
around
all
hearts
as
noble
as
his
there
is
a
second
envelope
that
forms
a
cuirass
the
first
bleeds
the
second
resists
no
replied
athos
raoul
will
die
of
it
mordioux
said
dartagnan
in
a
melancholy
tone
and
he
did
not
add
a
word
to
this
exclamation
then
a
minute
after
why
do
you
let
him
go
because
he
insists
on
going
and
why
do
you
not
go
with
him
because
i
could
not
bear
to
see
him
die
dartagnan
looked
his
friend
earnestly
in
the
face
you
know
one
thing
continued
the
comte
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
the
captain
you
know
that
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
been
afraid
of
but
few
things
well
i
have
an
incessant
gnawing
insurmountable
fear
that
an
hour
will
come
in
which
i
shall
hold
the
dead
body
of
that
boy
in
my
arms
oh
murmured
dartagnan
oh
he
will
die
i
know
i
have
a
perfect
conviction
of
that
but
i
would
not
see
him
die
how
is
this
athos
you
come
and
place
yourself
in
the
presence
of
the
bravest
man
you
say
you
have
ever
seen
of
your
own
dartagnan
of
that
man
without
an
equal
as
you
formerly
called
him
and
you
come
and
tell
him
with
your
arms
folded
that
you
are
afraid
of
witnessing
the
death
of
your
son
you
who
have
seen
all
that
can
be
seen
in
this
world
why
have
you
this
fear
athos
man
upon
this
earth
must
expect
everything
and
ought
to
face
everything
listen
to
me
my
friend
after
having
worn
myself
out
upon
this
earth
of
which
you
speak
i
have
preserved
but
two
religions
that
of
life
friendship
my
duty
as
a
fatherthat
of
eternity
love
and
respect
for
god
now
i
have
within
me
the
revelation
that
if
god
should
decree
that
my
friend
or
my
son
should
render
up
his
last
sigh
in
my
presenceoh
no
i
cannot
even
tell
you
dartagnan
speak
speak
tell
me
i
am
strong
against
everything
except
against
the
death
of
those
i
love
for
that
only
there
is
no
remedy
he
who
dies
gains
he
who
sees
others
die
loses
no
this
is
itto
know
that
i
should
no
more
meet
on
earth
him
whom
i
now
behold
with
joy
to
know
that
there
would
nowhere
be
a
dartagnan
any
more
nowhere
again
be
a
raoul
oh
i
am
old
look
you
i
have
no
longer
courage
i
pray
god
to
spare
me
in
my
weakness
but
if
he
struck
me
so
plainly
and
in
that
fashion
i
should
curse
him
a
christian
gentleman
ought
not
to
curse
his
god
dartagnan
it
is
enough
to
once
have
cursed
a
king
humph
sighed
dartagnan
a
little
confused
by
this
violent
tempest
of
grief
let
me
speak
to
him
athos
who
knows
try
if
you
please
but
i
am
convinced
you
will
not
succeed
i
will
not
attempt
to
console
him
i
will
serve
him
you
will
doubtless
i
will
do
you
think
this
would
be
the
first
time
a
woman
had
repented
of
an
infidelity
i
will
go
to
him
i
tell
you
athos
shook
his
head
and
continued
his
walk
alone
dartagnan
cutting
across
the
brambles
rejoined
raoul
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
well
raoul
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
i
have
a
kindness
to
ask
of
you
replied
bragelonne
ask
it
then
you
will
some
day
return
to
france
i
hope
so
ought
i
to
write
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
no
you
must
not
but
i
have
many
things
to
say
to
her
go
and
say
them
to
her
then
never
pray
what
virtue
do
you
attribute
to
a
letter
which
your
speech
might
not
possess
perhaps
you
are
right
she
loves
the
king
said
dartagnan
bluntly
and
she
is
an
honest
girl
raoul
started
and
you
you
whom
she
abandons
she
perhaps
loves
better
than
she
does
the
king
but
after
another
fashion
dartagnan
do
you
believe
she
loves
the
king
to
idolatry
her
heart
is
inaccessible
to
any
other
feeling
you
might
continue
to
live
near
her
and
would
be
her
best
friend
ah
exclaimed
raoul
with
a
passionate
burst
of
repugnance
at
such
a
hideous
hope
will
you
do
so
it
would
be
base
that
is
a
very
absurd
word
which
would
lead
me
to
think
slightly
of
your
understanding
please
to
understand
raoul
that
it
is
never
base
to
do
that
which
is
imposed
upon
us
by
a
superior
force
if
your
heart
says
to
you
go
there
or
die
why
go
raoul
was
she
base
or
brave
she
whom
you
loved
in
preferring
the
king
to
you
the
king
whom
her
heart
commanded
her
imperiously
to
prefer
to
you
no
she
was
the
bravest
of
women
do
then
as
she
has
done
oblige
yourself
do
you
know
one
thing
of
which
i
am
sure
raoul
what
is
that
why
that
by
seeing
her
closely
with
the
eyes
of
a
jealous
man
well
well
you
would
cease
to
love
her
then
i
am
decided
my
dear
dartagnan
to
set
off
to
see
her
again
no
to
set
off
that
i
may
never
see
her
again
i
wish
to
love
her
forever
ha
i
must
confess
replied
the
musketeer
that
is
a
conclusion
which
i
was
far
from
expecting
this
is
what
i
wish
my
friend
you
will
see
her
again
and
you
will
give
her
a
letter
which
if
you
think
proper
will
explain
to
her
as
to
yourself
what
is
passing
in
my
heart
read
it
i
drew
it
up
last
night
something
told
me
i
should
see
you
today
he
held
the
letter
out
and
dartagnan
read
mademoiselleyou
are
not
wrong
in
my
eyes
in
not
loving
me
you
have
only
been
guilty
of
one
fault
towards
me
that
of
having
left
me
to
believe
you
loved
me
this
error
will
cost
me
my
life
i
pardon
you
but
i
cannot
pardon
myself
it
is
said
that
happy
lovers
are
deaf
to
the
sorrows
of
rejected
lovers
it
will
not
be
so
with
you
who
did
not
love
me
save
with
anxiety
i
am
sure
that
if
i
had
persisted
in
endeavoring
to
change
that
friendship
into
love
you
would
have
yielded
out
of
a
fear
of
bringing
about
my
death
or
lessening
the
esteem
i
had
for
you
it
is
much
more
delightful
to
me
to
die
knowing
that
you
are
free
and
satisfied
how
much
then
will
you
love
me
when
you
will
no
longer
fear
either
my
presence
or
reproaches
you
will
love
me
because
however
charming
a
new
love
may
appear
to
you
god
has
not
made
me
in
anything
inferior
to
him
you
have
chosen
and
because
my
devotedness
my
sacrifice
and
my
painful
end
will
assure
me
in
your
eyes
a
certain
superiority
over
him
i
have
allowed
to
escape
in
the
candid
credulity
of
my
heart
the
treasure
i
possessed
many
people
tell
me
that
you
loved
me
enough
to
lead
me
to
hope
you
would
have
loved
me
much
that
idea
takes
from
my
mind
all
bitterness
and
leads
me
only
to
blame
myself
you
will
accept
this
last
farewell
and
you
will
bless
me
for
having
taken
refuge
in
the
inviolable
asylum
where
hatred
is
extinguished
and
where
all
love
endures
forever
adieu
mademoiselle
if
your
happiness
could
be
purchased
by
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
i
would
shed
that
drop
i
willingly
make
the
sacrifice
of
it
to
my
misery
raoul
vicotme
de
bragelonne
the
letter
reads
very
well
said
the
captain
i
have
only
one
fault
to
find
with
it
tell
me
what
that
is
said
raoul
why
it
is
that
it
tells
everything
except
the
thing
which
exhales
like
a
mortal
poison
from
your
eyes
and
from
your
heart
except
the
senseless
love
which
still
consumes
you
raoul
grew
paler
but
remained
silent
why
did
you
not
write
simply
these
words
mademoiselleinstead
of
cursing
you
i
love
you
and
i
die
that
is
true
exclaimed
raoul
with
a
sinister
kind
of
joy
and
tearing
the
letter
he
had
just
taken
back
he
wrote
the
following
words
upon
a
leaf
of
his
tablets
to
procure
the
happiness
of
once
more
telling
you
i
love
you
i
commit
the
baseness
of
writing
to
you
and
to
punish
myself
for
that
baseness
i
die
and
he
signed
it
you
will
give
her
these
tablets
captain
will
you
not
when
asked
the
latter
on
the
day
said
bragelonne
pointing
to
the
last
sentence
on
the
day
when
you
can
place
a
date
under
these
words
and
he
sprang
away
quickly
to
join
athos
who
was
returning
with
slow
steps
as
they
reentered
the
fort
the
sea
rose
with
that
rapid
gusty
vehemence
which
characterizes
the
mediterranean
the
illhumor
of
the
element
became
a
tempest
something
shapeless
and
tossed
about
violently
by
the
waves
appeared
just
off
the
coast
what
is
that
said
athosa
wrecked
boat
no
it
is
not
a
boat
said
dartagnan
pardon
me
said
raoul
there
is
a
bark
gaining
the
port
rapidly
yes
there
is
a
bark
in
the
creek
which
is
prudently
seeking
shelter
here
but
that
which
athos
points
to
in
the
sand
is
not
a
boat
at
allit
has
run
aground
yes
yes
i
see
it
it
is
the
carriage
which
i
threw
into
the
sea
after
landing
the
prisoner
well
said
athos
if
you
take
my
advice
dartagnan
you
will
burn
that
carriage
in
order
that
no
vestige
of
it
may
remain
without
which
the
fishermen
of
antibes
who
have
believed
they
had
to
do
with
the
devil
will
endeavor
to
prove
that
your
prisoner
was
but
a
man
your
advice
is
good
athos
and
i
will
this
night
have
it
carried
out
or
rather
i
will
carry
it
out
myself
but
let
us
go
in
for
the
rain
falls
heavily
and
the
lightning
is
terrific
as
they
were
passing
over
the
ramparts
to
a
gallery
of
which
dartagnan
had
the
key
they
saw
m
de
saintmars
directing
his
steps
towards
the
chamber
inhabited
by
the
prisoner
upon
a
sign
from
dartagnan
they
concealed
themselves
in
an
angle
of
the
staircase
what
is
it
said
athos
you
will
see
look
the
prisoner
is
returning
from
chapel
and
they
saw
by
the
red
flashes
of
lightning
against
the
violet
fog
which
the
wind
stamped
upon
the
bankward
sky
they
saw
pass
gravely
at
six
paces
behind
the
governor
a
man
clothed
in
black
and
masked
by
a
vizor
of
polished
steel
soldered
to
a
helmet
of
the
same
nature
which
altogether
enveloped
the
whole
of
his
head
the
fire
of
the
heavens
cast
red
reflections
on
the
polished
surface
and
these
reflections
flying
off
capriciously
seemed
to
be
angry
looks
launched
by
the
unfortunate
instead
of
imprecations
in
the
middle
of
the
gallery
the
prisoner
stopped
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
the
infinite
horizon
to
respire
the
sulphurous
perfumes
of
the
tempest
to
drink
in
thirstily
the
hot
rain
and
to
breathe
a
sigh
resembling
a
smothered
groan
come
on
monsieur
said
saintmars
sharply
to
the
prisoner
for
he
already
became
uneasy
at
seeing
him
look
so
long
beyond
the
walls
monsieur
come
on
say
monseigneur
cried
athos
from
his
corner
with
a
voice
so
solemn
and
terrible
that
the
governor
trembled
from
head
to
foot
athos
insisted
upon
respect
being
paid
to
fallen
majesty
the
prisoner
turned
round
who
spoke
asked
saintmars
it
was
i
replied
dartagnan
showing
himself
promptly
you
know
that
is
the
order
call
me
neither
monsieur
nor
monseigneur
said
the
prisoner
in
his
turn
in
a
voice
that
penetrated
to
the
very
soul
of
raoul
call
me
accursed
he
passed
on
and
the
iron
door
croaked
after
him
there
goes
a
truly
unfortunate
man
murmured
the
musketeer
in
a
hollow
whisper
pointing
out
to
raoul
the
chamber
inhabited
by
the
prince
chapter
xxxiii
promises
scarcely
had
dartagnan
reentered
his
apartment
with
his
two
friends
when
one
of
the
soldiers
of
the
fort
came
to
inform
him
that
the
governor
was
seeking
him
the
bark
which
raoul
had
perceived
at
sea
and
which
appeared
so
eager
to
gain
the
port
came
to
saintemarguerite
with
an
important
dispatch
for
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
on
opening
it
dartagnan
recognized
the
writing
of
the
king
i
should
think
said
louis
xiv
you
will
have
completed
the
execution
of
my
orders
monsieur
dartagnan
return
then
immediately
to
paris
and
join
me
at
the
louvre
there
is
the
end
of
my
exile
cried
the
musketeer
with
joy
god
be
praised
i
am
no
longer
a
jailer
and
he
showed
the
letter
to
athos
so
then
you
must
leave
us
replied
the
latter
in
a
melancholy
tone
yes
but
to
meet
again
dear
friend
seeing
that
raoul
is
old
enough
now
to
go
alone
with
m
de
beaufort
and
will
prefer
his
father
going
back
in
company
with
m
dartagnan
to
forcing
him
to
travel
two
hundred
leagues
solitarily
to
reach
home
at
la
fere
will
you
not
raoul
certainly
stammered
the
latter
with
an
expression
of
tender
regret
no
no
my
friend
interrupted
athos
i
will
never
quit
raoul
till
the
day
his
vessel
disappears
on
the
horizon
as
long
as
he
remains
in
france
he
shall
not
be
separated
from
me
as
you
please
dear
friend
but
we
will
at
least
leave
saintemarguerite
together
take
advantage
of
the
bark
that
will
convey
me
back
to
antibes
with
all
my
heart
we
cannot
too
soon
be
at
a
distance
from
this
fort
and
from
the
spectacle
that
shocked
us
so
just
now
the
three
friends
quitted
the
little
isle
after
paying
their
respects
to
the
governor
and
by
the
last
flashes
of
the
departing
tempest
they
took
their
farewell
of
the
white
walls
of
the
fort
dartagnan
parted
from
his
friend
that
same
night
after
having
seen
fire
set
to
the
carriage
upon
the
shore
by
the
orders
of
saintmars
according
to
the
advice
the
captain
had
given
him
before
getting
on
horseback
and
after
leaving
the
arms
of
athos
my
friends
said
he
you
bear
too
much
resemblance
to
two
soldiers
who
are
abandoning
their
post
something
warns
me
that
raoul
will
require
being
supported
by
you
in
his
rank
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
permission
to
go
over
into
africa
with
a
hundred
good
muskets
the
king
will
not
refuse
me
and
i
will
take
you
with
me
monsieur
dartagnan
replied
raoul
pressing
his
hand
with
emotion
thanks
for
that
offer
which
would
give
us
more
than
we
wish
either
monsieur
le
comte
or
i
i
who
am
young
stand
in
need
of
labor
of
mind
and
fatigue
of
body
monsieur
le
comte
wants
the
profoundest
repose
you
are
his
best
friend
i
recommend
him
to
your
care
in
watching
over
him
you
are
holding
both
our
souls
in
your
hands
i
must
go
my
horse
is
all
in
a
fret
said
dartagnan
with
whom
the
most
manifest
sign
of
a
lively
emotion
was
the
change
of
ideas
in
conversation
come
comte
how
many
days
longer
has
raoul
to
stay
here
three
days
at
most
and
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
reach
home
oh
a
considerable
time
replied
athos
i
shall
not
like
the
idea
of
being
separated
too
quickly
from
raoul
time
will
travel
too
fast
of
itself
to
require
me
to
aid
it
by
distance
i
shall
only
make
halfstages
and
why
so
my
friend
nothing
is
more
dull
than
traveling
slowly
and
hostelry
life
does
not
become
a
man
like
you
my
friend
i
came
hither
on
posthorses
but
i
wish
to
purchase
two
animals
of
a
superior
kind
now
to
take
them
home
fresh
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
make
them
travel
more
than
seven
or
eight
leagues
a
day
where
is
grimaud
he
arrived
yesterday
morning
with
raouls
appointments
and
i
have
left
him
to
sleep
that
is
never
to
come
back
again
dartagnan
suffered
to
escape
him
till
we
meet
again
then
dear
athosand
if
you
are
diligent
i
shall
embrace
you
the
sooner
so
saying
he
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
which
raoul
held
farewell
said
the
young
man
embracing
him
farewell
said
dartagnan
as
he
got
into
his
saddle
his
horse
made
a
movement
which
divided
the
cavalier
from
his
friends
this
scene
had
taken
place
in
front
of
the
house
chosen
by
athos
near
the
gates
of
antibes
whither
dartagnan
after
his
supper
had
ordered
his
horses
to
be
brought
the
road
began
to
branch
off
there
white
and
undulating
in
the
vapors
of
the
night
the
horse
eagerly
respired
the
salt
sharp
perfume
of
the
marshes
dartagnan
put
him
to
a
trot
and
athos
and
raoul
sadly
turned
towards
the
house
all
at
once
they
heard
the
rapid
approach
of
a
horses
steps
and
first
believed
it
to
be
one
of
those
singular
repercussions
which
deceive
the
ear
at
every
turn
in
a
road
but
it
was
really
the
return
of
the
horseman
they
uttered
a
cry
of
joyous
surprise
and
the
captain
springing
to
the
ground
like
a
young
man
seized
within
his
arms
the
two
beloved
heads
of
athos
and
raoul
he
held
them
long
embraced
thus
without
speaking
a
word
or
suffering
the
sigh
which
was
bursting
his
breast
to
escape
him
then
as
rapidly
as
he
had
come
back
he
set
off
again
with
a
sharp
application
of
his
spurs
to
the
sides
of
his
fiery
horse
alas
said
the
comte
in
a
low
voice
alas
alas
an
evil
omen
on
his
side
said
dartagnan
to
himself
making
up
for
lost
time
i
could
not
smile
upon
them
an
evil
omen
the
next
day
grimaud
was
on
foot
again
the
service
commanded
by
m
de
beaufort
was
happily
accomplished
the
flotilla
sent
to
toulon
by
the
exertions
of
raoul
had
set
out
dragging
after
it
in
little
nutshells
almost
invisible
the
wives
and
friends
of
the
fishermen
and
smugglers
put
in
requisition
for
the
service
of
the
fleet
the
time
so
short
which
remained
for
father
and
son
to
live
together
appeared
to
go
by
with
double
rapidity
like
some
swift
stream
that
flows
towards
eternity
athos
and
raoul
returned
to
toulon
which
began
to
be
filled
with
the
noise
of
carriages
with
the
noise
of
arms
the
noise
of
neighing
horses
the
trumpeters
sounded
their
spirited
marches
the
drummers
signalized
their
strength
the
streets
were
overflowing
with
soldiers
servants
and
tradespeople
the
duc
de
beaufort
was
everywhere
superintending
the
embarkation
with
the
zeal
and
interest
of
a
good
captain
he
encouraged
the
humblest
of
his
companions
he
scolded
his
lieutenants
even
those
of
the
highest
rank
artillery
provisions
baggage
he
insisted
upon
seeing
all
himself
he
examined
the
equipment
of
every
soldier
assured
himself
of
the
health
and
soundness
of
every
horse
it
was
plain
that
light
boastful
egotistical
in
his
hotel
the
gentleman
became
the
soldier
againthe
high
noble
a
captainin
face
of
the
responsibility
he
had
accepted
and
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
whatever
was
the
care
with
which
he
presided
over
the
preparations
for
departure
it
was
easy
to
perceive
careless
precipitation
and
the
absence
of
all
the
precaution
that
make
the
french
soldier
the
first
soldier
in
the
world
because
in
that
world
he
is
the
one
most
abandoned
to
his
own
physical
and
moral
resources
all
things
having
satisfied
or
appearing
to
have
satisfied
the
admiral
he
paid
his
compliments
to
raoul
and
gave
the
last
orders
for
sailing
which
was
ordered
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
he
invited
the
comte
had
his
son
to
dine
with
him
but
they
under
a
pretext
of
service
kept
themselves
apart
gaining
their
hostelry
situated
under
the
trees
of
the
great
place
they
took
their
repast
in
haste
and
athos
led
raoul
to
the
rocks
which
dominate
the
city
vast
gray
mountains
whence
the
view
is
infinite
and
embraces
a
liquid
horizon
which
appears
so
remote
is
it
on
a
level
with
the
rocks
themselves
the
night
was
fine
as
it
always
is
in
these
happy
climes
the
moon
rising
behind
the
rocks
unrolled
a
silver
sheet
on
the
cerulean
carpet
of
the
sea
in
the
roadsteads
maneuvered
silently
the
vessels
which
had
just
taken
their
rank
to
facilitate
the
embarkation
the
sea
loaded
with
phosphoric
light
opened
beneath
the
hulls
of
the
barks
that
transported
the
baggage
and
munitions
every
dip
of
the
prow
plowed
up
this
gulf
of
white
flames
from
every
oar
dropped
liquid
diamonds
the
sailors
rejoicing
in
the
largesses
of
the
admiral
were
heard
murmuring
their
slow
and
artless
songs
sometimes
the
grinding
of
the
chains
was
mixed
with
the
dull
noise
of
shot
falling
into
the
holds
such
harmonies
such
a
spectacle
oppress
the
heart
like
fear
and
dilate
it
like
hope
all
this
life

of
death
athos
had
seated
himself
with
his
son
upon
the
moss
among
the
brambles
of
the
promontory
around
their
heads
passed
and
repassed
large
bats
carried
along
by
the
fearful
whirl
of
their
blind
chase
the
feet
of
raoul
were
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
bathed
in
that
void
which
is
peopled
by
vertigo
and
provokes
to
selfannihilation
when
the
moon
had
risen
to
its
fullest
height
caressing
with
light
the
neighboring
peaks
when
the
watery
mirror
was
illumined
in
its
full
extent
and
the
little
red
fires
had
made
their
openings
in
the
black
masses
of
every
ship
athos
collecting
all
his
ideas
and
all
his
courage
said
god
has
made
all
these
things
that
we
see
raoul
he
has
made
us
alsopoor
atoms
mixed
up
with
this
monstrous
universe
we
shine
like
those
fires
and
those
stars
we
sigh
like
those
waves
we
suffer
like
those
great
ships
which
are
worn
out
in
plowing
the
waves
in
obeying
the
wind
that
urges
them
towards
an
end
as
the
breath
of
god
blows
us
towards
a
port
everything
likes
to
live
raoul
and
everything
seems
beautiful
to
living
things
monsieur
said
raoul
we
have
before
us
a
beautiful
spectacle
how
good
dartagnan
is
interrupted
athos
suddenly
and
what
a
rare
good
fortune
it
is
to
be
supported
during
a
whole
life
by
such
a
friend
as
he
is
that
is
what
you
have
missed
raoul
a
friend
cried
raoul
i
have
wanted
a
friend
m
de
guiche
is
an
agreeable
companion
resumed
the
comte
coldly
but
i
believe
in
the
times
in
which
you
live
men
are
more
engaged
in
their
own
interests
and
their
own
pleasures
than
they
were
in
ours
you
have
sought
a
secluded
life
that
is
a
great
happiness
but
you
have
lost
your
strength
thereby
we
four
more
weaned
from
those
delicate
abstractions
that
constitute
your
joy
furnished
much
more
resistance
when
misfortune
presented
itself
i
have
not
interrupted
you
monsieur
to
tell
you
that
i
had
a
friend
and
that
that
friend
is
m
de
guiche
certes
he
is
good
and
generous
and
moreover
he
loves
me
but
i
have
lived
under
the
guardianship
of
another
friendship
monsieur
as
precious
and
as
strong
as
that
of
which
you
speak
since
it
is
yours
i
have
not
been
a
friend
for
you
raoul
said
athos
eh
monsieur
and
in
what
respect
not
because
i
have
given
you
reason
to
think
that
life
has
but
one
face
because
sad
and
severe
alas
i
have
always
cut
off
for
you
without
god
knows
wishing
to
do
so
the
joyous
buds
that
spring
incessantly
from
the
fair
tree
of
youth
so
that
at
this
moment
i
repent
of
not
having
made
of
you
a
more
expansive
dissipated
animated
man
i
know
why
you
say
that
monsieur
no
it
is
not
you
who
have
made
me
what
i
am
it
was
love
which
took
me
at
the
time
when
children
only
have
inclinations
it
is
the
constancy
natural
to
my
character
which
with
other
creatures
is
but
habit
i
believed
that
i
should
always
be
as
i
was
i
thought
god
had
cast
me
in
a
path
quite
clear
quite
straight
bordered
with
fruits
and
flowers
i
had
ever
watching
over
me
your
vigilance
and
strength
i
believed
myself
to
be
vigilant
and
strong
nothing
prepared
me
i
fell
once
and
that
once
deprived
me
of
courage
for
the
whole
of
my
life
it
is
quite
true
that
i
wrecked
myself
oh
no
monsieur
you
are
nothing
in
my
past
but
happinessin
my
future
but
hope
no
i
have
no
reproach
to
make
against
life
such
as
you
made
it
for
me
i
bless
you
and
i
love
you
ardently
my
dear
raoul
your
words
do
me
good
they
prove
to
me
that
you
will
act
a
little
for
me
in
the
time
to
come
i
shall
only
act
for
you
monsieur
raoul
what
i
have
never
hitherto
done
with
respect
to
you
i
will
henceforward
do
i
will
be
your
friend
not
your
father
we
will
live
in
expanding
ourselves
instead
of

that

it
not
certainly
monsieur
for
such
an
expedition

long
soon
then
raoul
soon
instead
of
living
moderately
on
my
income
i
will
give
you
the
capital
of
my
estates
it
will
suffice
for
launching
you
into
the
world
till
my
death
and
you
will
give
me
i
hope
before
that

the
consolation
of
not
seeing
my
race
extinct
i
will
do
all
you
may
command
said
raoul
much
agitated
it
is
not
necessary
raoul
that
your
duty
as

should
lead
you
into
too
hazardous
enterprises
you
have
gone
through
your
ordeal
you
are
known
to
be
a
true
man
under
fire
remember
that
war
with
arabs
is
a
war
of
snares
ambuscades
and
assassinations
so
it
is
said
monsieur
there
is
never
much
glory
in
falling
in
an
ambuscade
it
is
a
death
which
always
implies
a
little
rashness
or
want
of
foresight
often
indeed
he
who
falls
in
one
meets
with
but
little
pity
those
who
are
not
pitied

we

stupid

you
clearly

what

oh
monsieur
with
sobriety
with
reasonable
exercise
i
have
already
obtained
from
m

a

off
every
fortnight
to

you
as

not
to

no
monsieur
said
raoul
almost
choked
with
emotion
besides
raoul
as
you
are
a
good
christian
and
i
am
one
also
we
ought
to
reckon
upon
a
more
special
protection
of

and
his
guardian
angels
promise
me
that
if
anything
evil
should
happen
to
you
on
any
occasion
you
will
think
of
me
at
once
first
and
at
once
oh
yes
monsieur
and
will
call
upon
me
instantly
you
dream
of
me
sometimes
do
you
not
raoul
every
night
monsieur
during
my
early
youth
i
saw
you
in
my
dreams
calm
and
mild
with
one
hand
stretched
out
over
my
head
and
that
it
was
which
made
me
sleep
so
soundlyformerly
we
love
each
other
too
dearly
said
the
comte
that
from
this
moment
in
which
we
separate
a
portion
of
both
our
souls
should
not
travel
with
one
and
the
other
of
us
and
should
not
dwell
wherever
we
may
dwell
whenever
you
may
be
sad
raoul
i
feel
that
my
heart
will
be
dissolved
in
sadness
and
when
you
smile
on
thinking
of
me
be
assured
you
will
send
me
from
however
remote
a
distance
a
vital
scintillation
of
your
joy
i
will
not
promise
you
to
be
joyous
replied
the
young
man
but
you
may
be
certain
that
i
will
never
pass
an
hour
without
thinking
of
you
not
one
hour
i
swear
unless
i
shall
be
dead
athos
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
threw
his
arm
round
the
neck
of
his
son
and
held
him
embraced
with
all
the
power
of
his
heart
the
moon
began
to
be
now
eclipsed
by
twilight
a
golden
band
surrounded
the
horizon
announcing
the
approach
of
the
day
athos
threw
his
cloak
over
the
shoulders
of
raoul
and
led
him
back
to
the
city
where
burdens
and
porters
were
already
in
motion
like
a
vast
anthill
at
the
extremity
of
the
plateau
which
athos
and
bragelonne
were
quitting
they
saw
a
dark
shadow
moving
uneasily
backwards
and
forwards
as
if
in
indecision
or
ashamed
to
be
seen
it
was
grimaud
who
in
his
anxiety
had
tracked
his
master
and
was
there
awaiting
him
oh
my
good
grimaud
cried
raoul
what
do
you
want
you
are
come
to
tell
us
it
is
time
to
be
gone
have
you
not
alone
said
grimaud
addressing
athos
and
pointing
to
raoul
in
a
tone
of
reproach
which
showed
to
what
an
extent
the
old
man
was
troubled
oh
you
are
right
cried
the
comte
no
raoul
shall
not
go
alone
no
he
shall
not
be
left
alone
in
a
strange
land
without
some
friendly
hand
to
support
him
some
friendly
heart
to
recall
to
him
all
he
loved
i
said
grimaud
you
yes
you
cried
raoul
touched
to
the
inmost
heart
alas
said
athos
you
are
very
old
my
good
grimaud
so
much
the
better
replied
the
latter
with
an
inexpressible
depth
of
feeling
and
intelligence
but
the
embarkation
is
begun
said
raoul
and
you
are
not
prepared
yes
said
grimaud
showing
the
keys
of
his
trunks
mixed
with
those
of
his
young
master
but
again
objected
raoul
you
cannot
leave
monsieur
le
comte
thus
alone
monsieur
le
comte
whom
you
have
never
quitted
grimaud
turned
his
diamond
eyes
upon
athos
and
raoul
as
if
to
measure
the
strength
of
both
the
comte
uttered
not
a
word
monsieur
le
comte
prefers
my
going
said
grimaud
i
do
said
athos
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
at
that
moment
the
drums
suddenly
rolled
and
the
clarions
filled
the
air

their
inspiring
notes

his
steps
slowly
towards

in

around
him
an
officer
came
quickly
towards
them
to
inform
raoul
that
m

anxious
to

him
by
his
side
have
the
kindness
to
tell

the

set
off
at
a
gallop
whether
we
part
here
or
part
there
added
the
comte
it
is
no
less
a
separation
he
carefully
brushed
the
dust
from
his
sons
coat
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
hair
as
they
walked
along
but
raoul
said
he
you
want
money
m
de
beauforts
train
will
be
splendid
and
i
am
certain
it
will
be
agreeable
to
you
to
purchase
horses
and
arms
which
are
very
dear
things
in
africa
now
as
you
are
not
actually
in
the
service
of
the
king

m

are
simply
a
volunteer
you
must
not
reckon
upon
either
pay

i
should
not

pressed
the

of
his
father
and
at
the
turning
of
a
street
they
saw
m
de

mounted
on
a
magnificent
white
genet

responded
by
graceful
curvets
to
the
applause
of
the
women
of
the
city

duke
called
raoul
and
held
out
his
hand
to
the
comte
he
spoke
to
him
for
some
time
with
such
a
kindly
expression
that
the
heart
of
the
poor
father
even
felt
a
little
comforted
it
was
however
evident
to
both
father
and
son
that
their
walk
amounted
to
nothing
less
than
a
punishment
there
was
a
terrible
momentthat
at
which
on
quitting
the
sands
of
the
shore
the
soldiers
and
sailors
exchanged
the
last
kisses
with
their
families
and
friends
a
supreme
moment
in

with
its

forgetful
of

of

a

of
these
two
men
whose
hearts
were
bursting
and
paternally
tenderly
very
much
as
porthos
might
have
done
he
took
raoul
in
his

him
in

at

in

into

off

be
fired
as

salute
to
the
coast
of
france
the
point
was
buried
in
its
turn
beneath
the
sky

athos
returned
with
slow
and
painful
step
to
his
deserted
hostelry
chapter
xxxiv
among
women
dartagnan
had
not
been
able
to
hide
his
feelings
from
his
friends
so
much
as
he
would
have
wished
the
stoical
soldier
the
impassive
manatarms
overcome
by
fear
and
sad
presentiments
had
yielded
for
a
few
moments
to
human
weakness
when
therefore
he
had
silenced
his
heart
and
calmed
the
agitation
of
his
nerves
turning
towards
his
lackey
a
silent
servant
always
listening
in
order
to
obey

more
promptly
rabaud
said
he
mind
we
must
travel
thirty
leagues
a
day
at
your
pleasure
captain
replied
rabaud
and
from
that
moment
dartagnan
accommodating
his
action
to
the
pace
of
the
horse
like
a
true
centaur
gave
up
his
thoughts
to
nothingthat
is
to
say
to
everything
he
asked
himself
why
the
king
had
sent
for
him
back
why
the
iron
mask
had
thrown
the
silver
plate
at
the
feet
of
raoul
as
to
the
first
subject
the
reply
was
negative
he
knew
right
well
that
the
kings
calling
him
was
from
necessity
he
still
further
knew
that
louis
xiv
must
experience
an
imperious
desire
for
a
private
conversation
with
one
whom
the
possession
of
such
a
secret
placed
on
a
level
with
the
highest
powers
of
the
kingdom
but
as
to
saying
exactly
what
the
kings
wish
was
dartagnan
found
himself
completely
at
a
loss
the
musketeer
had
no
doubts
either
upon
the
reason
which
had
urged
the
unfortunate
philippe
to
reveal
his
character
and
birth
philippe
buried
forever
beneath
a
mask
of
steel
exiled
to
a
country
where
the
men
seemed
little
more
than
slaves
of
the
elements
philippe
deprived
even
of
the
society
of
dartagnan
who
had
loaded
him
with
honors
and
delicate
attentions
had
nothing
more
to
see
than
odious
specters
in
this
world
and
despair
beginning
to
devour
him
he
poured
himself
forth
in
complaints
in
the
belief
that
his
revelations
would
raise
up
some
avenger
for
him
the
manner
in
which
the
musketeer
had
been
near
killing
his
two
best
friends
the
destiny
which
had
so
strangely
brought
athos
to
participate
in
the
great
state
secret
the
farewell
of
raoul
the
obscurity
of
the
future
which
threatened
to
end
in
a
melancholy
death
all
this
threw
dartagnan
incessantly
back
on
lamentable
predictions
and
forebodings
which
the
rapidity
of
his
pace
did
not
dissipate
as
it
used
formerly
to
do
dartagnan
passed
from
these
considerations
to
the
remembrance
of
the
proscribed
porthos
and
aramis
he
saw
them
both
fugitives
tracked
ruinedlaborious
architects
of
fortunes
they
had
lost
and
as
the
king
called
for
his
man
of
execution
in
hours
of
vengeance
and
malice
dartagnan
trembled
at
the
very
idea
of
receiving
some
commission
that
would
make
his
very
soul
bleed
sometimes
ascending
hills
when
the
winded
horse
breathed
hard
from
his
red
nostrils
and
heaved
his
flanks
the
captain
left
to
more
freedom
of
thought
reflected
on
the
prodigious
genius
of
aramis
a
genius
of
acumen
and
intrigue
a
match
to
which
the
fronde
and
the
civil
war
had
produced
but
twice
soldier
priest
diplomatist
gallant
avaricious
cunning
aramis
had
never
taken
the
good
things
of
this
life
except
as
steppingstones
to
rise
to
giddier
ends
generous
in
spirit
if
not
lofty
in
heart
he
never
did
ill
but
for
the
sake
of
shining
even
yet
more
brilliantly
towards
the
end
of
his
career
at
the
moment
of
reaching
the
goal
like
the
patrician
fuscus
he
had
made
a
false
step
upon
a
plank
and
had
fallen
into
the
sea
but
porthos
good
harmless
porthos
to
see
porthos
hungry
to
see
mousqueton
without
gold
lace
imprisoned
perhaps
to
see
pierrefonds
bracieux
razed
to
the
very
stones
dishonored
even
to
the
timberthese
were
so
many
poignant
griefs
for
dartagnan
and
every
time
that
one
of
these
griefs
struck
him
he
bounded
like
a
horse
at
the
sting
of
a
gadfly
beneath
the
vaults
of
foliage
where
he
has
sought
shady
shelter
from
the
burning
sun
never
was
the
man
of
spirit
subjected
to
ennui
if
his
body
was
exposed
to
fatigue
never
did
the
man
of
healthy
body
fail
to
find
life
light
if
he
had
something
to
engage
his
mind
dartagnan
riding
fast
thinking
as
constantly
alighted
from
his
horse
in
pairs
fresh
and
tender
in
his
muscles
as
the
athlete
preparing
for
the
gymnasium
the
king
did
not
expect
him
so
soon
and
had
just
departed
for
the
chase
towards
meudon
dartagnan
instead
of
riding
after
the
king
as
he
would
formerly
have
done
took
off
his
boots
had
a
bath
and
waited
till
his
majesty
should
return
dusty
and
tired
he
occupied
the
interval
of
five
hours
in
taking
as
people
say
the
air
of
the
house
and
in
arming
himself
against
all
ill
chances
he
learned
that
the
king
during
the
last
fortnight
had
been
gloomy
that
the
queenmother
was
ill
and
much
depressed
that
monsieur
the
kings
brother
was
exhibiting
a
devotional
turn
that
madame
had
the
vapors
and
that
m
de
guiche
was
gone
to
one
of
his
estates
he
learned
that
m
colbert
was
radiant
that
m
fouquet
consulted
a
fresh
physician
every
day
who
still
did
not
cure
him
and
that
his
principal
complaint
was
one
which
physicians
do
not
usually
cure
unless
they
are
political
physicians
the
king
dartagnan
was
told
behaved
in
the
kindest
manner
to
m
fouquet
and
did
not
allow
him
to
be
ever
out
of
his
sight
but
the
surintendant
touched
to
the
heart
like
one
of
those
fine
trees
a
worm
has
punctured
was
declining
daily
in
spite
of
the
royal
smile
that
sun
of
court
trees
dartagnan
learned
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
become
indispensable
to
the
king
that
the
king
during
his
sporting
excursions
if
he
did
not
take
her
with
him
wrote
to
her
frequently
no
longer
verses
but
which
was
much
worse
prose
and
that
whole
pages
at
a
time
thus
as
the
political
pleiad
of
the
day
said
the
first
king
in
the
world
was
seen
descending
from
his
horse
with
an
ardor
beyond
compare
and
on
the
crown
of
his
hat
scrawling
bombastic
phrases
which
m
de
saintaignan
aidedecamp
in
perpetuity
carried
to
la
valliere
at
the
risk
of
foundering
his
horses
during
this
time
deer
and
pheasants
were
left
to
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
nature
hunted
so
lazily
that
it
was
said
the
art
of
venery
ran
great
risk
of
degenerating
at
the
court
of
france
dartagnan
then
thought
of
the
wishes
of
poor
raoul
of
that
desponding
letter
destined
for
a
woman
who
passed
her
life
in
hoping
and
as
dartagnan
loved
to
philosophize
a
little
occasionally
he
resolved
to
profit
by
the
absence
of
the
king
to
have
a
minutes
talk
with
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
this
was
a
very
easy
affair
while
the
king
was
hunting
louise
was
walking
with
some
other
ladies
in
one
of
the
galleries
of
the
palais
royal
exactly
where
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
had
some
guards
to
inspect
dartagnan
did
not
doubt
that
if
he
could
but
open
the
conversation
on
raoul
louise
might
give
him
grounds
for
writing
a
consolatory
letter
to
the
poor
exile
and
hope
or
at
least
consolation
for
raoul
in
the
state
of
heart
in
which
he
had
left
him
was
the
sun
was
life
to
two
men
who
were
very
dear
to
our
captain
he
directed
his
course
therefore
to
the
spot
where
he
knew
he
should
find
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
dartagnan
found
la
valliere
the
center
of
the
circle
in
her
apparent
solitude
the
kings
favorite
received
like
a
queen
more
perhaps
than
the
queen
a
homage
of
which
madame
had
been
so
proud
when
all
the
kings
looks
were
directed
to
her
and
commanded
the
looks
of
the
courtiers
dartagnan
although
no
squire
of
dames
received
nevertheless
civilities
and
attentions
from
the
ladies
he
was
polite
as
a
brave
man
always
is
and
his
terrible
reputation
had
conciliated
as
much
friendship
among
the
men
as
admiration
among
the
women
on
seeing
him
enter
therefore
they
immediately
accosted
him
and
as
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
with
fair
ladies
opened
the
attack
by
questions
where
had
he
been
what
had
become
of
him
so
long
why
had
they
not
seen
him
as
usual
make
his
fine
horse
curvet
in
such
beautiful
style
to
the
delight
and
astonishment
of
the
curious
from
the
kings
balcony
he
replied
that
he
had
just
come
from
the
land
of
oranges
this
set
all
the
ladies
laughing
those
were
times
in
which
everybody
traveled
but
in
which
notwithstanding
a
journey
of
a
hundred
leagues
was
a
problem
often
solved
by
death
from
the
land
of
oranges
cried
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
from
spain
eh
eh
said
the
musketeer
from
malta
echoed
montalais
ma
foi
you
are
coming
very
near
ladies
is
it
an
island
asked
la
valliere
mademoiselle
said
dartagnan
i
will
not
give
you
the
trouble
of
seeking
any
further
i
come
from
the
country
where
m
de
beaufort
is
at
this
moment
embarking
for
algiers
have
you
seen
the
army
asked
several
warlike
fair
ones
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
replied
dartagnan
and
the
fleet
yes
i
saw
everything
have
we
any
of
us
any
friends
there
said
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
coldly
but
in
a
manner
to
attract
attention
to
a
question
that
was
not
without
its
calculated
aim
why
replied
dartagnan
yes
there
were
m

guillotiere
m
de

m
de

cried
the
perfidious
athenais
eh
whatis
he
gone
to
the

montalais
trod
on
her
toe
but
all
in
vain
do
you
know
what
my
opinion
is
continued
she
addressing
dartagnan
no
mademoiselle
but
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
it
my
opinion
is
then
that
all
the
men
who
go
to
this
war
are
desperate
desponding
men
whom
love
has
treated
ill
and
who
go
to
try
if
they
cannot
find
jetcomplexioned
women
more
kind
than
fair
ones
have
been
some
of
the
ladies
laughed
la
valliere
was
evidently
confused
montalais
coughed
loud
enough
to
waken
the
dead
mademoiselle
interrupted
dartagnan
you
are
in
error
when
you
speak
of
black
women
at
gigelli
the
women
there
have
not
jet

it
is
true
they
are
not
whitethey
are
yellow
yellow
exclaimed
the
bevy
of
fair
beauties
eh
do
not
disparage
it
i
have
never
seen
a
finer
color
to
match
with
black
eyes
and
a
coral
mouth
so
much
the
better
for
m
de
bragelonne
said
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
with
persistent
malice
he
will
make
amends
for
his
loss
poor
fellow
a
profound
silence
followed
these
words
and
dartagnan
had
time
to
observe
and
reflect
that
womenmild
dovestreat
each
other
more
cruelly
than
tigers
but
making
la
valliere
pale
did
not
satisfy
athenais
she
determined
to
make
her
blush
likewise
resuming
the
conversation
without
pause
do
you
know
louise
said
she
that
there
is
a
great
sin
on
your
conscience
what
sin
mademoiselle
stammered
the
unfortunate
girl
looking
round
her
for
support
without
finding
it
ehwhy
continued
athenais
the
poor
young
man
was
affianced
to
you
he
loved
you
you
cast
him
off
well
that
is
a
right
which
every
honest
woman
has
said
montalais
in
an
affected
tone
when
we
know
we
cannot
constitute
the
happiness
of
a
man
it
is
much
better
to
cast
him
off
cast
him
off
or
refuse
himthats
all
very
well
said
athenais
but
that
is
not
the
sin
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
has
to
reproach
herself
with
the
actual
sin
is
sending
poor
bragelonne
to
the
wars
and
to
wars
in
which
death
is
so
very
likely
to
be
met
with
louise
pressed
her
hand
over
her
icy
brow
and
if
he
dies
continued
her
pitiless
tormentor
you
will

killed

is
the
sin
louise
halfdead
caught
at
the
arm
of
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
whose
face
betrayed
unusual
emotion
you
wished
to
speak
with
me
monsieur
dartagnan
said
she
in
a
voice
broken
by
anger
and
pain
what
had
you
to
say
to
me
dartagnan
made
several
steps
along
the
gallery
holding
louise
on
his
arm
then
when
they
were
far
enough
removed
from
the
otherswhat
i
had
to
say
to
you
mademoiselle
replied
he
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
has
just
expressed
roughly
and
unkindly
it
is
true
but
still
in
its
entirety
she
uttered
a
faint
cry
pierced
to
the
heart
by
this
new
wound
she
went
her
way
like
one
of
those
poor
birds
which
struck
unto
death
seek
the
shade
of
the
thicket
in
which
to
die
she
disappeared
at
one
door
at
the
moment
the
king
was
entering
by
another
the
first
glance
of
the
king
was
directed
towards
the
empty
seat
of
his
mistress
not
perceiving
la
valliere
a
frown
came
over
his
brow
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
dartagnan
who
bowed
to
himah
monsieur
cried
he
you
have
been
diligent
i
am
much
pleased
with
you
this
was
the
superlative
expression
of
royal
satisfaction
many
men
would
have
been
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
for
such
a
speech
from
the
king
the
maids
of
honor
and
the
courtiers
who
had
formed
a
respectful
circle
round
the
king
on
his
entrance
drew
back
on
observing
he
wished
to
speak
privately
with
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
the
king
led
the
way
out
of
the
gallery
after
having
again
with
his
eyes
sought
everywhere
for
la
valliere
whose
absence
he
could
not
account
for
the
moment
they
were
out
of
the
reach
of
curious
ears
well
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
the
prisoner
is
in
his
prison
sire
what
did
he
say
on
the
road
nothing
sire
what
did
he
do
there
was
a
moment
at
which
the
fishermanwho
took
me
in
his
boat
to
saintemargueriterevolted
and
did
his
best
to
kill
me
thethe
prisoner
defended
me
instead
of
attempting
to
fly
the
king
became
pale
enough
said
he
and
dartagnan
bowed
louis
walked
about
his
cabinet
with
hasty
steps
were
you
at
antibes
said
he
when
monsieur
de
beaufort
came
there
no
sire
i
was
setting
off
when
monsieur
le
duc
arrived
ah
which
was
followed
by
a
fresh
silence
whom
did
you
see
there
a
great
many
persons
said
dartagnan
coolly
the
king
perceived
he
was
unwilling
to
speak
i
have
sent
for
you
monsieur
le
capitaine
to
desire
you
to
go
and
prepare
my
lodgings
at
nantes
at
nantes
cried
dartagnan
in
bretagne
yes
sire
it
is
in
bretagne
will
you
majesty
make
so
long
a
journey
as
to
nantes
the
states
are
assembled
there
replied
the
king
i
have
two
demands
to
make
of
them
i
wish
to
be
there
when
shall
i
set
out
said
the
captain
this
eveningtomorrowtomorrow
evening
for
you
must
stand
in
need
of
rest
i
have
rested
sire
that
is
well
then
between
this
and
tomorrow
evening
when
you
please
dartagnan
bowed
as
if
to
take
his
leave
but
perceiving
the
king
very
much
embarrassed
will
you
majesty
said
he
stepping
two
paces
forward
take
the
court
with
you
certainly
i
shall
then
you
majesty
will
doubtless
want
the
musketeers
and
the
eye
of
the
king
sank
beneath
the
penetrating
glance
of
the
captain
take
a
brigade
of
them
replied
louis
is
that
all
has
your
majesty
no
other
orders
to
give
me
noahyes
i
am
all
attention
sire
at
the
castle
of
nantes
which
i
hear
is
very
ill
arranged
you
will
adopt
the
practice
of
placing
musketeers
at
the
door
of
each
of
the
principal
dignitaries
i
shall
take
with
me
of
the
principal
yes
for
instance
at
the
door
of
m
de
lyonne
yes
and
that
of
m
letellier
yes
of
m
de
brienne
yes
and
of
monsieur
le
surintendant
without
doubt
very
well
sire
by
tomorrow
i
shall
have
set
out
oh
yes
but
one
more
word
monsieur
dartagnan
at
nantes
you
will
meet
with
m
le
duc
de
gesvres
captain
of
the
guards
be
sure
that
your
musketeers
are
placed
before
his
guards
arrive
precedence
always
belongs
to
the
first
comer
yes
sire
and
if
m
de
gesvres
should
question
you
question
me
sire
is
it
likely
that
m
de
gesvres
should
question
me
and
the
musketeer
turning
cavalierly
on
his
heel
disappeared
to
nantes
said
he
to
himself
as
he
descended
from
the
stairs
why
did
he
not
dare
to
say
from
thence
to
belleisle
as
he
reached
the
great
gates
one
of
m
briennes
clerks
came
running
after
him
exclaiming
monsieur
dartagnan
i
beg
your
pardon
what
is
the
matter
monsieur
ariste
the
king
has
desired
me
to
give
you
this
order
upon
your
cashbox
asked
the
musketeer
no
monsieur
on
that
of
m
fouquet
dartagnan
was
surprised
but
he
took
the
order
which
was
in
the
kings
own
writing
and
was
for
two
hundred
pistoles
what
thought
he
after
having
politely
thanked
m
briennes
clerk
m
fouquet
is
to
pay
for
the
journey
then
mordioux
that
is
a
bit
of
pure
louis
xi
why
was
not
this
order
on
the
chest
of
m
colbert
he
would
have
paid
it
with
such
joy
and
dartagnan
faithful
to
his
principle
of
never
letting
an
order
at
sight
get
cold
went
straight
to
the
house
of
m
fouquet
to
receive
his
two
hundred
pistoles
chapter
xxxv
the
last
supper
the
superintendent
had
no
doubt
received
advice
of
the
approaching
departure
for
he
was
giving
a
farewell
dinner
to
his
friends
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
house
the
hurry
of
the
servants
bearing
dishes
and
the
diligence
of
the
registres
denoted
an
approaching
change
in
offices
and
kitchen
dartagnan
with
his
order
in
his
hand
presented
himself
at
the
offices
when
he
was
told
it
was
too
late
to
pay
cash
the
chest
was
closed
he
only
replied
on
the
kings
service
the
clerk
a
little
put
out
by
the
serious
air
of
the
captain
replied
that
that
was
a
very
respectable
reason
but
that
the
customs
of
the
house
were
respectable
likewise
and
that
in
consequence
he
begged
the
bearer
to
call
again
next
day
dartagnan
asked
if
he
could
not
see
m
fouquet
the
clerk
replied
that
m
le
surintendant
did
not
interfere
with
such
details
and
rudely
closed
the
outer
door
in
the
captains
face
but
the
latter
had
foreseen
this
stroke
and
placed
his
boot
between
the
door
and
the
doorcase
so
that
the
lock
did
not
catch
and
the
clerk
was
still
nose
to
nose
with
his
interlocutor
this
made
him
change
his
tone
and
say
with
terrified
politeness
if
monsieur
wishes
to
speak
to
m
le
surintendant
he
must
go
to
the
antechambers
these
are
the
offices
where
monseigneur
never
comes
oh
very
well
where
are
they
replied
dartagnan
on
the
other
side
of
the
court
said
the
clerk
delighted
to
be
free
dartagnan
crossed
the
court
and
fell
in
with
a
crowd
of
servants
monseigneur
sees
nobody
at
this
hour
he
was
answered
by
a
fellow
carrying
a
vermeil
dish
in
which
were
three
pheasants
and
twelve
quails
tell
him
said
the
captain
laying
hold
of
the
servant
by
the
end
of
his
dish
that
i
am
m
dartagnan
captain
of
his
majestys
musketeers
the
fellow
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
disappeared
dartagnan
following
him
slowly
he
arrived
just
in
time
to
meet
m
pelisson
in
the
antechamber
the
latter
a
little
pale
came
hastily
out
of
the
diningroom
to
learn
what
was
the
matter
dartagnan
smiled
there
is
nothing
unpleasant
monsieur
pelisson
only
a
little
order
to
receive
the
money
for
ah
said
fouquets
friend
breathing
more
freely
and
he
took
the
captain
by
the
hand
and
dragging
him
behind
him
led
him
into
the
diningroom
where
a
number
of
friends
surrounded
the
surintendant
placed
in
the
center
and
buried
in
the
cushions
of
a
fauteuil
there
were
assembled
all
the
epicureans
who
so
lately
at
vaux
had
done
the
honors
of
the
mansion
of
wit
and
money
in
aid
of
m
fouquet
joyous
friends
for
the
most
part
faithful
they
had
not
fled
their
protector
at
the
approach
of
the
storm
and
in
spite
of
the
threatening
heavens
in
spite
of
the
trembling
earth
they
remained
there
smiling
cheerful
as
devoted
in
misfortune
as
they
had
been
in
prosperity
on
the
left
of
the
surintendant
sat
madame
de
belliere
on
his
right
was
madame
fouquet
as
if
braving
the
laws
of
the
world
and
putting
all
vulgar
reasons
of
propriety
to
silence
the
two
protecting
angels
of
this
man
united
to
offer
at
the
moment
of
the
crisis
the
support
of
their
twined
arms
madame
de
belliere
was
pale
trembling
and
full
of
respectful
attentions
for
madame
la
surintendante
who
with
one
hand
on
her
husbands
was
looking
anxiously
towards
the
door
by
which
pelisson
had
gone
out
to
bring
dartagnan
the
captain
entered
at
first
full
of
courtesy
and
afterwards
of
admiration
when
with
his
infallible
glance
he
had
divined
as
well
as
taken
in
the
expression
of
every
face
fouquet
raised
himself
up
in
his
chair
pardon
me
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
if
i
did
not
myself
receive
you
when
coming
in
the
kings
name
and
he
pronounced
the
last
words
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
firmness
which
filled
the
hearts
of
all
his
friends
with
terror
monseigneur
replied
dartagnan
i
only
come
to
you
in
the
kings
name
to
demand
payment
of
an
order
for
two
hundred
pistoles
the
clouds
passed
from
every
brow
but
that
of
fouquet
which
still
remained
overcast
ah
then
said
he
perhaps
you
also
are
setting
out
for
nantes
i
do
not
know
whither
i
am
setting
out
monseigneur
but
said
madame
fouquet
recovered
from
her
fright
you
are
not
going
so
soon
monsieur
le
capitaine
as
not
to
do
us
the
honor
to
take
a
seat
with
us
madame
i
should
esteem
that
a
great
honor
done
me
but
i
am
so
pressed
for
time
that
you
see
i
have
been
obliged
to
permit
myself
to
interrupt
your
repast
to
procure
payment
of
my
note
the
reply
to
which
shall
be
gold
said
fouquet
making
a
sign
to
his
intendant
who
went
out
with
the
order
dartagnan
handed
him
oh
said
the
latter
i
was
not
uneasy
about
the
payment
the
house
is
good
a
painful
smile
passed
over
the
pale
features
of
fouquet
are
you
in
pain
asked
madame
de
belliere
do
you
feel
your
attack
coming
on
asked
madame
fouquet
neither
thank
you
both
said
fouquet
your
attack
said
dartagnan
in
his
turn
are
you
unwell
monseigneur
i
have
a
tertian
fever
which
seized
me
after
the
fete
at
vaux
caught
cold
in
the
grottos
at
night
perhaps
no
no
nothing
but
agitation
that
was
all
the
too
much
heart
you
displayed
in
your
reception
of
the
king
said
la
fontaine
quietly
without
suspicion
that
he
was
uttering
a
sacrilege
we
cannot
devote
too
much
heart
to
the
reception
of
our
king
said
fouquet
mildly
to
his
poet
monsieur
meant
to
say
the
too
great
ardor
interrupted
dartagnan
with
perfect
frankness
and
much
amenity
the
fact
is
monseigneur
that
hospitality
was
never
practiced
as
at
vaux
madame
fouquet
permitted
her
countenance
to
show
clearly
that
if
fouquet
had
conducted
himself
well
towards
the
king
the
king
had
hardly
done
the
like
to
the
minister
but
dartagnan
knew
the
terrible
secret
he
alone
with
fouquet
knew
it
those
two
men
had
not
the
one
the
courage
to
complain
the
other
the
right
to
accuse
the
captain
to
whom
the
two
hundred
pistoles
were
brought
was
about
to
take
his
leave
when
fouquet
rising
took
a
glass
of
wine
and
ordered
one
to
be
given
to
dartagnan
monsieur
said
he
to
the
health
of
the
king
whatever
may
happen
and
to
your
health
monseigneur
whatever
may
happen
said
dartagnan
he
bowed
with
these
words
of
evil
omen
to
all
the
company
who
rose
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
sound
of
his
spurs
and
boots
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
i
for
a
moment
thought
it
was
i
and
not
my
money
he
wanted
said
fouquet
endeavoring
to
laugh
you
cried
his
friends
and
what
for
in
the
name
of
heaven
oh
do
not
deceive
yourselves
my
dear
brothers
in
epicurus
said
the
superintendent
i
do
not
wish
to
make
a
comparison
between
the
most
humble
sinner
on
the
earth
and
the
god
we
adore
but
remember
he
gave
one
day
to
his
friends
a
repast
which
is
called
the
last
supper
and
which
was
nothing
but
a
farewell
dinner
like
that
which
we
are
making
at
this
moment
a
painful
cry
of
denial
arose
from
all
parts
of
the
table
shut
the
doors
said
fouquet
and
the
servants
disappeared
my
friends
continued
fouquet
lowering
his
voice
what

formerly
what

when
he

not

say
then
when
he
really
sinks
i

no
more
money

i
have
no

anything
but
powerful
enemies

powerless
friends

cried

such
frankness
it

at

a

madame

what
is
to

done
there
the
king
summons
me
to

i
know
well
it
is
for
the
purpose

be
to
evince
uneasiness

i

discovered

reconciling
everything
cried
pelisson
you

going

fouquet
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
surprise
but
with
friends
but
in
your
own
carriage
as
far
as
orleans
in
your
own
barge
as
far
as

ready
to
defend
yourself
if
you
are
attacked
to
escape
if
you
are
threatened
in

you
will
carry
your
money
against
all

whilst
flying
you
will
only
have
obeyed
the

reaching
the

you
like
you

embark
for

from

you
will
shoot

added
la

intoxicated
with
fresh
projects
and
enthusiasm
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
this
concert
of
joy
and
hope
a
courier
from
the
king
said
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
a
profound
silence
immediately
ensued
as
if
the
message
brought
by
this
courier
was
nothing
but
a
reply
to
all
the
projects
given
birth
to
a
moment
before
every
one
waited
to
see
what
the
master
would
do
his
brow
was
streaming
with
perspiration
and
he
was
really
suffering
from
his
fever
at
that
instant
he
passed
into
his
cabinet
to
receive
the
kings
message
there
prevailed
as
we
have
said
such
a
silence
in
the
chambers
and
throughout
the
attendance
that
from
the
diningroom
could
be
heard
the
voice
of
fouquet
saying
that
is
well
monsieur
this
voice
was
however
broken
by
fatigue
and
trembled
with
emotion
an
instant
after
fouquet
called
gourville
who
crossed
the
gallery
amidst
the
universal
expectation
at
length
he
himself
reappeared
among
his
guests
but
it
was
no
longer
the
same
pale
spiritless
countenance
they
had
beheld
when
he
left
them
from
pale
he
had
become
livid
and
from
spiritless
annihilated
a
breathing
living
specter
he
advanced
with
his
arms
stretched
out
his
mouth
parched
like
a
shade
that
comes
to
salute
the
friends
of
former
days
on
seeing
him
thus
every
one
cried
out
and
every
one
rushed
towards
fouquet
the
latter
looking
at
pelisson
leaned
upon
his
wife
and
pressed
the
icy
hand
of
the
marquise
de
belliere
well
said
he
in
a
voice
which
had
nothing
human
in
it
what
has
happened
my
god
said
some
one
to
him
fouquet
opened
his
right
hand
which
was
clenched
but
glistening
with
perspiration
and
displayed
a
paper
upon
which
pelisson
cast
a
terrified
glance
he
read
the
following
lines
written
by
the
kings
hand

and
wellbeloved

us

we
stand
in

to
prepare
for

as
we
know

health
is
not

we
pray

to

keeping

the
present

to

as

a
murmur
of
terror
circulated
through
the
apartment
well
cried
pelisson
in
his
turn
you
have
received
that
letter
received
it
yes
what
will
you
do
then
nothing
since
i

received
it
but
if
i
have
received
it
pelisson
i
have
paid
it
said
the
surintendant
with
a
simplicity
that
went
to
the
heart
of
all
present
you
have
paid
it

there
then
cried
every
voice
at
once
there
then
is
there
an
instant
to
be
lost
madame
fouquet
rushed
downstairs
calling
for
her
horses
madame
de

flew
after
her
catching
her
in
her
arms
and

pelisson
ran
to
have
the
horses
put
to
the
carriages
and
in
the
meantime
gourville
gathered
in
his
hat
all
that
the
weeping

were
able
to

explained
this

departure
by
saying
that

chapter

in
m
colberts
carriage
as
gourville
had
seen
the
kings
musketeers
were
mounting
and
following
their
captain
the
latter
who
did
not
like
to
be
confined
in
his
proceedings
left
his
brigade
under
the
orders
of
a
lieutenant
and
set
off
on
post
horses
recommending
his
men
to
use
all
diligence
however
rapidly
they
might
travel
they
could
not
arrive
before
him
he
had
time
in
passing
along
the
rue
des
petitschamps
to
see
something
which
afforded
him
plenty
of
food
for
thought
and
conjecture
he
saw
m
colbert
coming
out
from
his
house
to
get
into
his
carriage
which
was
stationed
before
the
door
in
this
carriage
dartagnan
perceived
the
hoods
of
two
women
and
being
rather
curious
he
wished
to
know
the
names
of
the
ladies
hid
beneath
these
hoods
to
get
a
glimpse
at
them
for
they
kept
themselves
closely
covered
up
he
urged
his
horse
so
near
the
carriage
that
he
drove
him
against
the
step
with
such
force
as
to
shake
everything
containing
and
contained
the
terrified
women
uttered
the
one
a
faint
cry
by
which
dartagnan
recognized
a
young
woman
the
other
an
imprecation
in
which
he
recognized
the
vigor
and
aplomb
that
half
a
century
bestows
the
hoods
were
thrown
back
one
of
the
women
was
madame
vanel
the
other
the
duchesse
de
chevreuse
dartagnans
eyes
were
quicker
than
those
of
the
ladies
he
had
seen
and
known
them
whilst
they
did
not
recognize
him
and
as
they
laughed
at
their
fright
pressing
each
others
hands
humph
said
dartagnan
the
old
duchesse
is
no
more
inaccessible
to
friendship
than
formerly
she
paying
her
court
to
the
mistress
of
m
colbert
poor
m
fouquet
that
presages
you
nothing
good
he
rode
on
m
colbert
got
into
his
carriage
and
the
distinguished
trio
commenced
a
sufficiently
slow
pilgrimage
toward
the
wood
of
vincennes
madame
de
chevreuse
set
down
madame
vanel
at
her
husbands
house
and
left
alone
with
m
colbert
chatted
upon
affairs
whilst
continuing
her
ride
she
had
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
conversation
that
dear
duchesse
and
as
she
always
talked
for
the
ill
of
others
though
ever
with
a
view
to
her
own
good
her
conversation
amused
her
interlocutor
and
did
not
fail
to
leave
a
favorable
impression
she
taught
colbert
who
poor
man
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
how
great
a
minister
he
was
and
how
fouquet
would
soon
become
a
cipher
she
promised
to
rally
around
him
when
he
should
become
surintendant
all
the
old
nobility
of
the
kingdom
and
questioned
him
as
to
the
preponderance
it
would
be
proper
to
allow
la
valliere
she
praised
him
she
blamed
him
she
bewildered
him
she
showed
him
the
secret
of
so
many
secrets
that
for
a
moment
colbert
thought
he
was
doing
business
with
the
devil
she
proved
to
him
that
she
held
in
her
hand
the
colbert
of
today
as
she
had
held
the
fouquet
of
yesterday
and
as
he
asked
her
very
simply
the
reason
of
her
hatred
for
the
surintendant
why
do
you
yourself
hate
him
said
she
madame
in
politics
replied
he
the
differences
of
system
oft
bring
about
dissentions
between
men
m
fouquet
always
appeared
to
me
to
practice
a
system
opposed
to
the
true
interests
of
the
king
she
interrupted
himi
will
say
no
more
to
you
about
m
fouquet
the
journey
the
king
is
about
to
take
to
nantes
will
give
a
good
account
of
him
m
fouquet
for
me
is
a
man
gone
byand
for
you
also
colbert
made
no
reply
on
his
return
from
nantes
continued
the
duchesse
the
king
who
is
only
anxious
for
a
pretext
will
find
that
the
states
have
not
behaved
wellthat
they
have
made
too
few
sacrifices
the
states
will
say
that
the
imposts
are
too
heavy
and
that
the
surintendant
has
ruined
them
the
king
will
lay
all
the
blame
on
m
fouquet
and
then
and
then
said
colbert
oh
he
will
be
disgraced
is
not
that
your
opinion
colbert
darted
a
glance
at
the
duchesse
which
plainly
said
if
m
fouquet
be
only
disgraced
you
will
not
be
the
cause
of
it
your
place
m
colbert
the
duchesse
hastened
to
say
must
be
a
high
place
do
you
perceive
any
one
between
the
king
and
yourself
after
the
fall
of
m
fouquet
i
do
not
understand
said
he
you
will
understand
to
what
does
your
ambition
aspire
i
have
none
it
was
useless
then
to
overthrow
the
superintendent
monsieur
colbert
it
was
idle
i
had
the
honor
to
tell
you
madame
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
the
interest
of
the
kingbut
if
you
please
we
will
speak
of
your
own
mine
that
is
to
say
the
affairs
of
his
majesty
in
short
are
you
or
are
you
not
endeavoring
to
ruin
m
fouquet
answer
without
evasion
madame
i
ruin
nobody
i
am
endeavoring
to
comprehend
then
why
you
purchased
from
me
the
letters
of
m
mazarin
concerning
m
fouquet
neither
can
i
conceive
why
you
have
laid
those
letters
before
the
king
colbert
half
stupefied
looked
at
the
duchesse
with
an
air
of
constraint
madame
said
he
i
can
less
easily
conceive
how
you
who
received
the
money
can
reproach
me
on
that
head
that
is
said
the
old
duchesse
because
we
must
will
that
which
we
wish
for
unless
we
are
not
able
to
obtain
what
we
wish
will
said
colbert
quite
confounded
by
such
coarse
logic
you
are
not
able
hein
speak
i
am
not
able
i
allow
to
destroy
certain
influences
near
the
king
that
fight
in
favor
of
m
fouquet
what
are
they
stop
let
me
help
you
do
madame
la
valliere
oh
very
little
influence
no
knowledge
of
business
and
small
means
m
fouquet
has
paid
his
court
to
her
to
defend
him
would
be
to
accuse
herself
would
it
not
i
think
it
would
there
is
still
another
influence
what
do
you
say
to
that
is
it
considerable
the
queenmother
perhaps
her
majesty
the
queenmother
has
a
weakness
for
m
fouquet
very
prejudicial
to
her
son
never
believe
that
said
the
old
duchesse
smiling
oh
said
colbert
with
incredulity
i
have
often
experienced
it
formerly
very
recently
madame
at
vaux
it
was
she
who
prevented
the
king
from
having
m
fouquet
arrested
people
do
not
forever
entertain
the
same
opinions
my
dear
monsieur
that
which
the
queen
may
have
wished
recently
she
would
not
wish
perhaps
today
and
why
not
said
colbert
astonished
oh
the
reason
is
of
very
little
consequence
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
is
of
great
consequence
for
if
i
were
certain
of
not
displeasing
her
majesty
the
queenmother
my
scruples
would
be
all
removed
well
have
you
never
heard
talk
of
a
certain
secret
a
secret
call
it
what
you
like
in
short
the
queenmother
has
conceived
a
bitter
hatred
for
all
those
who
have
participated
in
one
fashion
or
another
in
the
discovery
of
this
secret
and
m
fouquet
i
believe
is
one
of
these
then
said
colbert
we
may
be
sure
of
the
assent
of
the
queenmother
i
have
just
left
her
majesty
and
she
assures
me
so
so
be
it
then
madame
but
there
is
something
further
do
you
happen
to
know
a
man
who
was
the
intimate
friend
of
m
fouquet
m
dherblay
a
bishop
i
believe
bishop
of
vannes
well
this
m
dherblay
who
also
knew
the
secret
the
queenmother
is
pursuing
with
the
utmost
rancor
indeed
so
hotly
pursued
that
if
he
were
dead
she
would
not
be
satisfied
with
anything
less
than
his
head
to
satisfy
her
he
would
never
speak
again
and
is
that
the
desire
of
the
queenmother
an
order
is
given
for
it
this
monsieur
dherblay
shall
be
sought
for
madame
oh
it
is
well
known
where
he
is
colbert
looked
at
the
duchesse
say
where
madame
he
is
at
belleileenmer
at
the
residence
of
m
fouquet
at
the
residence
of
m
fouquet
he
shall
be
taken
it
was
now
the
duchesses
turn
to
smile
do
not
fancy
the
capture
so
easy
said
she
do
not
promise
it
so
lightly
why
not
madame
because
m
dherblay
is
not
one
of
those
people
who
can
be
taken
when
and
where
you
please
he
is
a
rebel
then
oh
monsieur
colbert
we
have
passed
all
our
lives
in
making
rebels
and
yet
you
see
plainly
that
so
far
from
being
taken
we
take
others
colbert
fixed
upon
the
old
duchesse
one
of
those
fierce
looks
of
which
no
words
can
convey
the
expression
accompanied
by
a
firmness
not
altogether
wanting
in
grandeur
the
times
are
gone
said
he
in
which
subjects
gained
duchies
by
making
war
against
the
king
of
france
if
m
dherblay
conspires
he
will
perish
on
the
scaffold
that
will
give
or
will
not
give
pleasure
to
his
enemiesa
matter
by
the
way
of
little
importance
to
us
and
this
us
a
strange
word
in
the
mouth
of
colbert
made
the
duchesse
thoughtful
for
a
moment
she
caught
herself
reckoning
inwardly
with
this
mancolbert
had
regained
his
superiority
in
the
conversation
and
he
meant
to
keep
it
you
ask
me
madame
he
said
to
have
this
m
dherblay
arrested
ii
ask
you
nothing
of
the
kind
i
thought
you
did
madame
but
as
i
have
been
mistaken
we
will
leave
him
alone
the
king
has
said
nothing
about
him
the
duchesse
bit
her
nails
besides
continued
colbert
what
a
poor
capture
would
this
bishop
be
a
bishop
game
for
a
king
oh
no
no
i
will
not
even
take
the
slightest
notice
of
him
the
hatred
of
the
duchesse
now
discovered
itself
game
for
a
woman
said
she
is
not
the
queen
a
woman
if
she
wishes
m
dherblay
arrested
she
has
her
reasons
besides
is
not
m
dherblay
the
friend
of
him
who
is
doomed
to
fall
oh
never
mind
that
said
colbert
this
man
shall
be
spared
if
he
is
not
the
enemy
of
the
king
is
that
displeasing
to
you
i
say
nothing
yesyou
wish
to
see
him
in
prison
in
the
bastile
for
instance
i
believe
a
secret
better
concealed
behind
the
walls
of
the
bastile
than
behind
those
of
belleisle
i
will
speak
to
the
king
about
it
he
will
clear
up
the
point
and
whilst
waiting
for
that
enlightenment
monsieur
leveque
de
vannes
will
have
escaped
i
would
do
so
escaped
he
and
whither
should
he
escape
europe
is
ours
in
will
if
not
in
fact
he
will
always
find
an
asylum
monsieur
it
is
evident
you
know
nothing
of
the
man
you
have
to
do
with
you
do
not
know
dherblay
you
do
not
know
aramis
he
was
one
of
those
four
musketeers
who
under
the
late
king
made
cardinal
de
richelieu
tremble
and
who
during
the
regency
gave
so
much
trouble
to
monseigneur
mazarin
but
madame
what
can
he
do
unless
he
has
a
kingdom
to
back
him
he
has
one
monsieur
a
kingdom
he
what
monsieur
dherblay
i
repeat
to
you
monsieur
that
if
he
wants
a
kingdom
he
either
has
it
or
will
have
it
well
as
you
are
so
earnest
that
this
rebel
should
not
escape
madame
i
promise
you
he
shall
not
escape
belleisle
is
fortified
m
colbert
and
fortified
by
him
if
belleisle
were
also
defended
by
him
belleisle
is
not
impregnable
and
if
monsieur
leveque
de
vannes
is
shut
up
in
belleisle
well
madame
the
place
shall
be
besieged
and
he
will
be
taken
you
may
be
very
certain
monsieur
that
the
zeal
you
display
in
the
interest
of
the
queenmother
will
please
her
majesty
mightily
and
you
will
be
magnificently
rewarded
but
what
shall
i
tell
her
of
your
projects
respecting
this
man
that
when
once
taken
he
shall
be
shut
up
in
a
fortress
from
which
her
secret
shall
never
escape
very
well
monsieur
colbert
and
we
may
say
that
dating
from
this
instant
we
have
formed
a
solid
alliance
that
is
you
and
i
and
that
i
am
absolutely
at
your
service
it
is
i
madame
who
place
myself
at
yours
this
chevalier
dherblay
is
a
kind
of
spanish
spy
is
he
not
much
more
a
secret
ambassador
higher
still
stopking
phillip
iii
of
spain
is
a
bigot
he
is
perhaps
the
confessor
of
phillip
iii
you
must
go
higher
even
than
that
mordieu
cried
colbert
who
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
swear
in
the
presence
of
this
great
lady
of
this
old
friend
of
the
queenmother
he
must
then
be
the
general
of
the
jesuits
i
believe
you
have
guessed
it
at
last
replied
the
duchesse
ah
then
madame
this
man
will
ruin
us
all
if
we
do
not
ruin
him
and
we
must
make
haste
too
such
was
my
opinion
monsieur
but
i
did
not
dare
to
give
it
you
and
it
was
lucky
for
us
he
has
attacked
the
throne
and
not
us
but
mark
this
well
m
colbert
m
dherblay
is
never
discouraged
if
he
has
missed
one
blow
he
will
be
sure
to
make
another
he
will
begin
again
if
he
has
allowed
an
opportunity
to
escape
of
making
a
king
for
himself
sooner
or
later
he
will
make
another
of
whom
to
a
certainty
you
will
not
be
prime
minister
colbert
knitted
his
brow
with
a
menacing
expression
i
feel
assured
that
a
prison
will
settle
this
affair
for
us
madame
in
a
manner
satisfactory
for
both
the
duchesse
smiled
again
oh
if
you
knew
said
she
how
many
times
aramis
has
got
out
of
prison
oh
replied
colbert
we
will
take
care
that
he
shall
not
get
out
this
time
but
you
were
not
attending
to
what
i
said
to
you
just
now
do
you
remember
that
aramis
was
one
of
the
four
invincibles
whom
richelieu
so
dreaded
and
at
that
period
the
four
musketeers
were
not
in
possession
of
that
which
they
have
nowmoney
and
experience
colbert
bit
his
lips
we
will
renounce
the
idea
of
the
prison
said
he
in
a
lower
tone
we
will
find
a
little
retreat
from
which
the
invincible
cannot
possibly
escape
that
was
well
spoken
our
ally
replied
the
duchesse
but
it
is
getting
late
had
we
not
better
return
the
more
willingly
madame
from
my
having
my
preparations
to
make
for
setting
out
with
the
king
to
paris
cried
the
duchesse
to
the
coachman
and
the
carriage
returned
towards
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
after
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
that
gave
to
death
the
last
friend
of
fouquet
the
last
defender
of
belleisle
the
former
friend
of
marie
michon

new
foe
of
the
old

chapter
xxxvii
the
two
lighters
dartagnan
had
set
off
fouquet
likewise
was
gone
and
with
a
rapidity
which
doubled
the
tender
interest
of
his
friends
the
first
moments
of
this
journey
or
better
say
this
flight
were
troubled
by
a
ceaseless
dread
of
every
horse
and
carriage
to
be
seen
behind
the
fugitive
it
was
not
natural
in
fact
if
louis
xiv
was
determined
to
seize
this
prey
that
he
should
allow
it
to
escape
the
young
lion
was
already
accustomed
to
the
chase
and
he
had
bloodhounds
sufficiently
clever
to
be
trusted
but
insensibly
all
fears
were
dispersed
the
surintendant
by
hard
traveling
placed
such
a
distance
between
himself
and
his
persecutors
that
no
one
of
them
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
overtake
him
as
to
his
position
his
friends
had
made
it
excellent
for
him
was
he
not
traveling
to
join
the
king
at
nantes
and
what
did
the
rapidity
prove
but
his
zeal
to
obey
he
arrived
fatigued
but
reassured
at
orleans
where
he
found
thanks
to
the
care
of
a
courier
who
had
preceded
him
a
handsome
lighter
of
eight
oars
these
lighters
in
the
shape
of
gondolas
somewhat
wide
and
heavy
containing
a
small
chamber
covered
by
the
deck
and
a
chamber
in
the
poop
formed
by
a
tent
then
acted
as
passageboats
from
orleans
to
nantes
by
the
loire
and
this
passage
a
long
one
in
our
days
appeared
then
more
easy
and
convenient
than
the
highroad
with
its
posthacks
and
its
illhung
carriages
fouquet
went
on
board
this
lighter
which
set
out
immediately
the
rowers
knowing
they
had
the
honor
of
conveying
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
pulled
with
all
their
strength
and
that
magic
word
the
finances
promised
them
a
liberal
gratification
of
which
they
wished
to
prove
themselves
worthy
the
lighter
seemed
to
leap
the
mimic
waves
of
the
loire
magnificent
weather
a
sunrise
that
empurpled
all
the
landscape
displayed
the
river
in
all
its
limpid
serenity
the
current
and
the
rowers
carried
fouquet
along
as
wings
carry
a
bird
and
he
arrived
before
beaugency
without
the
slightest
accident
having
signalized
the
voyage
fouquet
hoped
to
be
the
first
to
arrive
at
nantes
there
he
would
see
the
notables
and
gain
support
among
the
principal
members
of
the
states
he
would
make
himself
a
necessity
a
thing
very
easy
for
a
man
of
his
merit
and
would
delay
the
catastrophe
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
avoiding
it
entirely
besides
said
gourville
to
him
at
nantes
you
will
make
out
or
we
will
make
out
the
intentions
of
your
enemies
we
will
have
horses
always
ready
to
convey
you
to
poitou
a
bark
in
which
to
gain
the
sea
and
when
once
upon
the
open
sea
belleisle
is
your
inviolable
port
you
see
besides
that
no
one
is
watching
you
no
one
is
following
he
had
scarcely
finished
when
they
discovered
at
a
distance
behind
an
elbow
formed
by
the
river
the
masts
of
a
huge
lighter
coming
down
the
rowers
of
fouquets
boat
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
on
seeing
this
galley
what
is
the
matter
asked
fouquet
the
matter
is
monseigneur
replied
the
patron
of
the
bark
that
it
is
a
truly
remarkable
thingthat
lighter
comes
along
like
a
hurricane
gourville
started
and
mounted
to
the
deck
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
fouquet
did
not
go
up
with
him
but
said
to
gourville
with
restrained
mistrust
see
what
it
is
dear
friend
the
lighter
had
just
passed
the
elbow
it
came
on
so
fast
that
behind
it
might
be
plainly
seen
the
white
wake
illumined
with
the
fires
of
the
day
how
they
go
repeated
the
skipper
how
they
go
they
must
be
well
paid
i
did
not
think
he
added
that
oars
of
wood
could
behave
better
than
ours
but
yonder
oarsmen
prove
the
contrary
well
they
may
said
one
of
the
rowers
they
are
twelve
and
we
but
eight
twelve
rowers
replied
gourville
twelve
impossible
the
number
of
eight
rowers
for
a
lighter
had
never
been
exceeded
even
for
the
king
this
honor
had
been
paid
to
monsieur
le
surintendant
more
for
the
sake
of
haste
than
of
respect
what
does
it
mean
said
gourville
endeavoring
to
distinguish
beneath
the
tent
which
was
already
apparent
travelers
which
the
most
piercing
eye
could
not
yet
have
succeeded
in
discovering
they
must
be
in
a
hurry
for
it
is
not
the
king
said
the
patron
fouquet
shuddered
by
what
sign
do
you
know
that
it
is
not
the
king
said
gourville
in
the
first
place
because
there
is
no
white
flag
with
fleursdelis
which
the
royal
lighter
always
carries
and
then
said
fouquet
because
it
is
impossible
it
should
be
the
king
gourville
as
the
king
was
still
in
paris
yesterday
gourville
replied
to
the
surintendant
by
a
look
which
said
you
were
there
yourself
yesterday
and
by
what
sign
do
you
make
out
they
are
in
such
haste
added
he
for
the
sake
of
gaining
time
by
this
monsieur
said
the
patron
these
people
must
have
set
out
a
long
while
after
us
and
they
have
already
nearly
overtaken
us
bah
said
gourville
who
told
you
that
they
do
not
come
from
beaugency
or
from
moit
even
we
have
seen
no
lighter
of
that
shape
except
at
orleans
it
comes
from
orleans
monsieur
and
makes
great
haste
fouquet
and
gourville
exchanged
a
glance
the
captain
remarked
their
uneasiness
and
to
mislead
him
gourville
immediately
said
some
friend
who
has
laid
a
wager
he
would
catch
us
let
us
win
the
wager
and
not
allow
him
to
come
up
with
us
the
patron
opened
his
mouth
to
say
that
it
was
quite
impossible
but
fouquet
said
with
much
hauteurif
it
is
any
one
who
wishes
to
overtake
us
let
him
come
we
can
try
monseigneur
said
the
man
timidly
come
you
fellows
put
out
your
strength
row
row
no
said
fouquet
on
the
contrary
stop
short
monseigneur
what
folly
interrupted
gourville
stooping
towards
his
ear
pull
up
repeated
fouquet
the
eight
oars
stopped
and
resisting
the
water
created
a
retrograde
motion
it
stopped
the
twelve
rowers
in
the
other
did
not
at
first
perceive
this
maneuver
for
they
continued
to
urge
on
their
boat
so
vigorously
that
it
arrived
quickly
within
musketshot
fouquet
was
shortsighted
gourville
was
annoyed
by
the
sun
now
full
in
his
eyes
the
skipper
alone
with
that
habit
and
clearness
which
are
acquired
by
a
constant
struggle
with
the
elements
perceived
distinctly
the
travelers
in
the
neighboring
lighter
i
can
see
them
cried
he
there
are
two
i
can
see
nothing
said
gourville
you
will
not
be
long
before
you
distinguish
them
in
twenty
strokes
of
their
oars
they
will
be
within
ten
paces
of
us
but
what
the
patron
announced
was
not
realized
the
lighter
imitated
the
movement
commanded
by
fouquet
and
instead
of
coming
to
join
its
pretended
friends
it
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
river
i
cannot
comprehend
this
said
the
captain
nor
i
cried
gourville
you
who
can
see
so
plainly
the
people
in
that
lighter
resumed
fouquet
try
to
describe
them
to
us
before
we
are
too
far
off
i
thought
i
saw
two
replied
the
boatman
i
can
only
see
one
now
under
the
tent
what
sort
of
man
is
he
he
is
a
dark
man
broadshouldered
bullnecked
a
little
cloud
at
that
moment
passed
across
the
azure
darkening
the
sun
gourville
who
was
still
looking
with
one
hand
over
his
eyes
became
able
to
see
what
he
sought
and
all
at
once
jumping
from
the
deck
into
the
chamber
where
fouquet
awaited
him
colbert
said
he
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
colbert
repeated
fouquet
too
strange
but
no
it
is
impossible
i
tell
you
i
recognized
him
and
he
at
the
same
time
so
plainly
recognized
me
that
he
is
just
gone
into
the
chamber
on
the
poop
perhaps
the
king
has
sent
him
on
our
track
in
that
case
he
would
join
us
instead
of
lying
by
what
is
he
doing
there
he
is
watching
us
without
a
doubt
i
do
not
like
uncertainty
said
fouquet
let
us
go
straight
up
to
him
oh
monseigneur
do
not
do
that
the
lighter
is
full
of
armed
men
he
wishes
to
arrest
me
then
gourville
why
does
he
not
come
on
monseigneur
it
is
not
consistent
with
your
dignity
to
go
to
meet
even
your
ruin
but
to
allow
them
to
watch
me
like
a
malefactor
nothing
yet
proves
that
they
are
watching
you
monseigneur
be
patient
what
is
to
be
done
then
do
not
stop
you
were
only
going
so
fast
to
appear
to
obey
the
kings
order
with
zeal
redouble
the
speed
he
who
lives
will
see
that
is
better
come
cried
fouquet
since
they
remain
stockstill
yonder
let
us
go
on
the
captain
gave
the
signal
and
fouquets
rowers
resumed
their
task
with
all
the
success
that
could
be
looked
for
from
men
who
had
rested
scarcely
had
the
lighter
made
a
hundred
fathoms
than
the
other
that
with
the
twelve
rowers
resumed
its
rapid
course
this
position
lasted
all
day
without
any
increase
or
diminution
of
distance
between
the
two
vessels
towards
evening
fouquet
wished
to
try
the
intentions
of
his
persecutor
he
ordered
his
rowers
to
pull
towards
the
shore
as
if
to
effect
a
landing
colberts
lighter
imitated
this
maneuver
and
steered
towards
the
shore
in
a
slanting
direction
by
the
merest
chance
at
the
spot
where
fouquet
pretended
to
wish
to
land
a
stableman
from
the
chateau
of
langeais
was
following
the
flowery
banks
leading
three
horses
in
halters
without
doubt
the
people
of
the
twelveoared
lighter
fancied
that
fouquet
was
directing
his
course
to
these
horses
ready
for
flight
for
four
or
five
men
armed
with
muskets
jumped
from
the
lighter
on
to
the
shore
and
marched
along
the
banks
as
if
to
gain
ground
on
the
horseman
fouquet
satisfied
of
having
forced
the
enemy
to
a
demonstration
considered
his
intention
evident
and
put
his
boat
in
motion
again
colberts
people
returned
likewise
to
theirs
and
the
course
of
the
two
vessels
was
resumed
with
fresh
perseverance
upon
seeing
this
fouquet
felt
himself
threatened
closely
and
in
a
prophetic
voicewell
gourville
said
he
whisperingly
what
did
i
say
at
our
last
repast
at
my
house
am
i
going
or
not
to
my
ruin
oh
monseigneur
these
two
boats
which
follow
each
other
with
so
much
emulation
as
if
we
were
disputing
m
colbert
and
i
a
prize
for
swiftness
on
the
loire
do
they
not
aptly
represent
our
fortunes
and
do
you
not
believe
gourville
that
one
of
the
two
will
be
wrecked
at
nantes
at
least
objected
gourville
there
is
still
uncertainty
you
are
about
to
appear
at
the
states
you
are
about
to
show
what
sort
of
man
you
are
your
eloquence
and
genius
for
business
are
the
buckler
and
sword
that
will
serve
to
defend
you
if
not
to
conquer
with
the
bretons
do
not
know
you
and
when
they
become
acquainted
with
you
your
cause
is
won
oh
let
m
colbert
look
to
it
well
for
his
lighter
is
as
much
exposed
as
yours
to
being
upset
both
go
quickly
his
faster
than
yours
it
is
true
we
shall
see
which
will
be
wrecked
first
fouquet
taking
gourvilles
handmy
friend
said
he
everything
considered
remember
the
proverb
first
come
first
served
well
m
colbert
takes
care
not
to
pass
me
he
is
a
prudent
man
is
m
colbert
he
was
right
the
two
lighters
held
their
course
as
far
as
nantes
watching
each
other
when
the
surintendant
landed
gourville
hoped
he
should
be
able
to
seek
refuge
at
once
and
have
the
relays
prepared
but
at
the
landing
the
second
lighter
joined
the
first
and
colbert
approaching
fouquet
saluted
him
on
the
quay
with
marks
of
the
profoundest
respectmarks
so
significant
so
public
that
their
result
was
the
bringing
of
the
whole
population
upon
la
fosse
fouquet
was
completely
selfpossessed
he
felt
that
in
his
last
moments
of
greatness
he
had
obligations
towards
himself
he
wished
to
fall
from
such
a
height
that
his
fall
should
crush
some
of
his
enemies
colbert
was
thereso
much
the
worse
for
colbert
the
surintendant
therefore
coming
up
to
him
replied
with
that
arrogant
semiclosure
of
the
eyes
peculiar
to
himwhat
is
that
you
m
colbert
to
offer
you
my
respects
monseigneur
said
the
latter
were
you
in
that
lighterpointing
to
the
one
with
twelve
rowers
yes
monseigneur
of
twelve
rowers
said
fouquet
what
luxury
m
colbert
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
was
the
queenmother
monseigneurand
colbert
blushed
this
is
a
voyage
that
will
cost
those
who
have
to
pay
for
it
dear
monsieur
lintendant
said
fouquet
but
you
have
happily
arrivedyou
see
however
added
he
a
moment
after
that
i
who
had
but
eight
rowers
arrived
before
you
and
he
turned
his
back
towards
him
leaving
him
uncertain
whether
the
maneuvers
of
the
second
lighter
had
escaped
the
notice
of
the
first
at
least
he
did
not
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
showing
that
he
had
been
frightened
colbert
so
annoyingly
attacked
did
not
give
way
i
have
not
been
quick
monseigneur
he
replied
because
i
followed
your
example
whenever
you
stopped
and
why
did
you
do
that
monsieur
colbert
cried
fouquet
irritated
by
the
base
audacity
as
you
had
a
superior
crew
to
mine
why
did
you
not
either
join
me
or
pass
me
out
of
respect
said
the
intendant
bowing
to
the
ground
fouquet
got
into
a
carriage
which
the
city
had
sent
to
him
we
know
not
why
or
how
and
he
repaired
to
la
maison
de
nantes
escorted
by
a
vast
crowd
of
people
who
for
several
days
had
been
agog
with
expectation
of
a
convocation
of
the
states
scarcely
was
he
installed
when
gourville
went
out
to
order
horses
on
the
route
to
poitiers
and
vannes
and
a
boat
at
paimboef
he
performed
these
various
operations
with
so
much
mystery
activity
and
generosity
that
never
was
fouquet
then
laboring
under
an
attack
of
fever
more
nearly
saved
except
for
the
counteraction
of
that
immense
disturber
of
human
projectschance
a
report
was
spread
during
the
night
that
the
king
was
coming
in
great
haste
on
post
horses
and
would
arrive
in
ten
or
twelve
hours
at
the
latest
the
people
while
waiting
for
the
king
were
greatly
rejoiced
to
see
the
musketeers
newly
arrived
with
monsieur
dartagnan
their
captain
and
quartered
in
the
castle
of
which
they
occupied
all
the
posts
in
quality
of
guard
of
honor
m
dartagnan
who
was
very
polite
presented
himself
about
ten
oclock
at
the
lodgings
of
the
surintendant
to
pay
his
respectful
compliments
and
although
the
minister
suffered
from
fever
although
he
was
in
such
pain
as
to
be
bathed
in
sweat
he
would
receive
m
dartagnan
who
was
delighted
with
that
honor
as
will
be
seen
by
the
conversation
they
had
together
chapter

friendly
advice
fouquet
had
gone
to
bed
like
a
man
who
clings
to
life
and
wishes
to
economize
as
much
as
possible
that
slender
tissue
of
existence
of
which
the
shocks
and
frictions
of
this
world
so
quickly
wear
out
the
tenuity
dartagnan
appeared
at
the
door
of
this
chamber
and
was
saluted
by
the
superintendent
with
a
very
affable
good
day
bon
jour
monseigneur
replied
the
musketeer
how
did
you
get
through
the
journey
tolerably
well
thank
you
and
the
fever
but
poorly
i
drink
as
you
perceive
i
am
scarcely
arrived
and
i
have
already
levied
a
contribution
of
tisane
upon
nantes
you
should
sleep
first
monseigneur
eh
corbleu
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
i
should
be
very
glad
to
sleep
who
hinders
you
why
you
in
the
first
place
i
oh
monseigneur
no
doubt
you
do
is
it
at
nantes
as
at
paris
do
you
not
come
in
the
kings
name
for
heavens
sake
monseigneur
replied
the
captain
leave
the
king
alone
the
day
on
which
i
shall
come
on
the
part
of
the
king
for
the
purpose
you
mean
take
my
word
for
it
i
will
not
leave
you
long
in
doubt
you
will
see
me
place
my
hand
on
my
sword
according
to
the
ordonnance
and
you
will
hear
my
say
at
once
in
ceremonial
voice
monseigneur
in
the
name
of
the
king
i
arrest
you
you
promise
me
that
frankness
said
the
superintendent
upon
my
honor
but
we
have
not
come
to
that
believe
me
what
makes
you
think
that
m
dartagnan
for
my
part
i
think
quite
the
contrary
i
have
heard
speak
of
nothing
of
the
kind
replied
dartagnan
eh
eh
said
fouquet
indeed
no
you
are
an
agreeable
man
in
spite
of
your
fever
the
king
should
not
cannot
help
loving
you
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
fouquets
expression
implied
doubt
but
m
colbert
said
he
does
m
colbert
love
me
as
much
as
you
say
i
am
not
speaking
of
m
colbert
replied
dartagnan
he
is
an
exceptional
man
he
does
not
love
you
so
much
is
very
possible
but
mordioux
the
squirrel
can
guard
himself
against
the
adder
with
very
little
trouble
do
you
know
that
you
are
speaking
to
me
quite
as
a
friend
replied
fouquet
and
that
upon
my
life
i
have
never
met
with
a
man
of
your
intelligence
and
heart
you
are
pleased
to
say
so
replied
dartagnan
why
did
you
wait
till
today
to
pay
me
such
a
compliment
blind
that
we
are
murmured
fouquet
your
voice
is
getting
hoarse
said
dartagnan
drink
monseigneur
drink
and
he
offered
him
a
cup
of
tisane
with
the
most
friendly
cordiality
fouquet
took
it
and
thanked
him
by
a
gentle
smile
such
things
only
happen
to
me
said
the
musketeer
i
have
passed
ten
years
under
your
very
beard
while
you
were
rolling
about
tons
of
gold
you
were
clearing
an
annual
pension
of
four
millions
you
never
observed
me
and
you
find
out
there
is
such
a
person
in
the
world
just
at
the
moment
you
just
at
the
moment
i
am
about
to
fall
interrupted
fouquet
that
is
true
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
i
did
not
say
so
but
you
thought
so
and
that
is
the
same
thing
well
if
i
fall
take
my
word
as
truth
i
shall
not
pass
a
single
day
without
saying
to
myself
as
i
strike
my
brow
fool
foolstupid
mortal
you
had
a
monsieur
dartagnan
under
your
eye
and
hand
and
you
did
not
employ
him
you
did
not
enrich
him
you
overwhelm
me
said
the
captain
i
esteem
you
greatly
there
exists
another
man
then
who
does
not
think
as
m
colbert
thinks
said
the
surintendant
how
this
m
colbert
looms
up
in
your
imagination
he
is
worse
than
fever
oh
i
have
good
cause
said
fouquet
judge
for
yourself
and
he
related
the
details
of
the
course
of
the
lighters
and
the
hypocritical
persecution
of
colbert
is
not
this
a
clear
sign
of
my
ruin
dartagnan
became
very
serious
that
is
true
he
said
yes
it
has
an
unsavory
odor
as
m
de
treville
used
to
say
and
he
fixed
on
m
fouquet
his
intelligent
and
significant
look
am
i
not
clearly
designated
in
that
captain
is
not
the
king
bringing
me
to
nantes
to
get
me
away
from
paris
where
i
have
so
many
creatures
and
to
possess
himself
of
belleisle
where
m
dherblay
is
added
dartagnan
fouquet
raised
his
head
as
for
me
monseigneur
continued
dartagnan
i
can
assure
you
the
king
has
said
nothing
to
me
against
you
indeed
the
king
commanded
me
to
set
out
for
nantes
it
is
true
and
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
m
de
gesvres
my
friend
to
m
de
gesvres
yes
monseigneur
continued
the
musketeer
whose
eye
s
did
not
cease
to
speak
a
language
different
from
the
language
of
his
lips
the
king
moreover
commanded
me
to
take
a
brigade
of
musketeers
which
is
apparently
superfluous
as
the
country
is
quite
quiet
a
brigade
said
fouquet
raising
himself
upon
his
elbow
ninetysix
horsemen
yes
monseigneur
the
same
number
as
were
employed
in
arresting
mm
de
chalais
de
cinqmars
and
montmorency
fouquet
pricked
up
his
ears
at
these
words
pronounced
without
apparent
value
and
what
else
said
he
oh
nothing
but
insignificant
orders
such
as
guarding
the
castle
guarding
every
lodging
allowing
none
of
m
de
gesvress
guards
to
occupy
a
single
post
and
as
to
myself
cried
fouquet
what
orders
had
you
as
to
you
monseigneurnot
the
smallest
word
monsieur
dartagnan
my
safety
my
honor
perhaps
my
life
are
at
stake
you
would
not
deceive
me
ito
what
end
are
you
threatened
only
there
really
is
an
order
with
respect
to
carriages
and
boats
an
order
yes
but
it
cannot
concern
youa
simple
measure
of
police
what
is
it
captainwhat
is
it
to
forbid
all
horses
or
boats
to
leave
nantes
without
a
pass
signed
by
the
king
great
god
but
dartagnan
began
to
laugh
all
that
is
not
to
be
put
into
execution
before
the
arrival
of
the
king
at
nantes
so
that
you
see
plainly
monseigneur
the
order
in
nowise
concerns
you
fouquet
became
thoughtful
and
dartagnan
feigned
not
to
observe
his
preoccupation
it
is
evident
by
my
thus
confiding
to
you
the
orders
which
have
been
given
to
me
that
i
am
friendly
towards
you
and
that
i
am
trying
to
prove
to
you
that
none
of
them
are
directed
against
you
without
doubtwithout
doubt
said
fouquet
still
absent
let
us
recapitulate
said
the
captain
his
glance
beaming
with
earnestness
a
special
guard
about
the
castle
in
which
your
lodging
is
to
be
is
it
not
do
you
know
the
castle
ah
monseigneur
a
regular
prison
the
absence
of
m
de
gesvres
who
has
the
honor
of
being
one
of
your
friends
the
closing
of
the
gates
of
the
city
and
of
the
river
without
a
pass
but
only
when
the
king
shall
have
arrived
please
to
observe
monsieur
fouquet
that
if
instead
of
speaking
to
man
like
you
who
are
one
of
the
first
in
the
kingdom
i
were
speaking
to
a
troubled
uneasy
consciencei
should
compromise
myself
forever
what
a
fine
opportunity
for
any
one
who
wished
to
be
free
no
police
no
guards
no
orders
the
water
free
the
roads
free
monsieur
dartagnan
obliged
to
lend
his
horses
if
required
all
this
ought
to
reassure
you
monsieur
fouquet
for
the
king
would
not
have
left
me
thus
independent
if
he
had
any
sinister
designs
in
truth
monsieur
fouquet
ask
me
whatever
you
like
i
am
at
your
service
and
in
return
if
you
will
consent
to
do
it
do
me
a
service
that
of
giving
my
compliments
to
aramis
and
porthos
in
case
you
embark
for
belleisle
as
you
have
a
right
to
do
without
changing
your
dress
immediately
in
your
robe
de
chambrejust
as
you
are
saying
these
words
and
with
a
profound
bow
the
musketeer
whose
looks
had
lost
none
of
their
intelligent
kindness
left
the
apartment
he
had
not
reached
the
steps
of
the
vestibule
when
fouquet
quite
beside
himself
hung
to
the
bellrope
and
shouted
my
horsesmy
lighter
but
nobody
answered
the
surintendant
dressed
himself
with
everything
that
came
to
hand
gourvillegourville
cried
he
while
slipping
his
watch
into
his
pocket
and
the
bell
sounded
again
whilst
fouquet
repeated

gourville
at

breathless
and
pale

us
be

let
us
be
gone
cried
fouquet
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
it
is
too
late
said
the
surintendants
poor
friend
too
latewhy
listen
and
they
heard
the
sounds
of
trumpets
and
drums
in
front
of
the
castle
what
does
that
mean
gourville
it
means
the
king
is
come
monseigneur
the
king
the
king
who
has
ridden
double
stages
who
has
killed
horses
and
who
is
eight
hours
in
advance
of
all
our
calculations
we
are
lost
murmured
fouquet
brave
dartagnan
all
is
over
thou
has
spoken
to
me
too
late
the
king
in
fact
was
entering
the
city
which
soon
resounded
with
the
cannon
from
the
ramparts
and
from
a
vessel
which
replied
from
the
lower
parts
of
the
river
fouquets
brow
darkened
he
called
his
valets
de
chambre
and
dressed
in
ceremonial
costume
from
his
window
behind
the
curtains
he
could
see
the
eagerness
of
the
people
and
the
movement
of
a
large
troop
which
had
followed
the
prince
the
king
was
conducted
to
the
castle
with
great
pomp
and
fouquet
saw
him
dismount
under
the
portcullis
and
say
something
in
the
ear
of
dartagnan
who
held
his
stirrup
dartagnan
when
the
king
had
passed
under
the
arch
directed
his
steps
towards
the
house
fouquet
was
in
but
so
slowly
and
stopping
so
frequently
to
speak
to
his
musketeers
drawn
up
like
a
hedge
that
it
might
be
said
he
was
counting
the
seconds
or
the
steps
before
accomplishing
his
object
fouquet
opened
the
window
to
speak
to
him
in
the
court
ah
cried
dartagnan
on
perceiving
him
are
you
still
there
monseigneur
and
that
word
still
completed
the
proof
to
fouquet
of
how
much
information
and
how
many
useful
counsels
were
contained
in
the
first
visit
the
musketeer
had
paid
him
the
surintendant
sighed
deeply
good
heavens
yes
monsieur
replied
he
the
arrival
of
the
king
has
interrupted
me
in
the
projects
i
had
formed
oh
then
you
know
that
the
king
has
arrived
yes
monsieur
i
have
seen
him
and
this
time
you
come
from
him
to
inquire

fouquet
heaved
a
last
sigh
climbed
with
difficulty
into
his
carriage
so
great
was
his
weakness
and
went
to
the
castle
escorted
by
dartagnan
whose
politeness
was
not
less
terrifying
this
time
than
it
had
just
before
been

chapter
xxxix
how
the
king
louis
xiv
played
his
little
part
as
fouquet
was
alighting
from
his
carriage
to
enter
the
castle
of
nantes
a
man
of
mean
appearance
went
up
to
him
with
marks
of
the
greatest
respect
and
gave
him
a
letter
dartagnan
endeavored
to
prevent
this
man
from
speaking
to
fouquet
and
pushed
him
away
but
the
message
had
been
given
to
the
surintendant
fouquet
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
and
instantly
a
vague
terror
which
dartagnan
did
not
fail
to
penetrate
was
painted
on
the
countenance
of
the
first
minister
fouquet
put
the
paper
into
the
portfolio
which
he
had
under
his
arm
and
passed
on
towards
the
kings
apartments
dartagnan
through
the
small
windows
made
at
every
landing
of
the
donjon
stairs
saw
as
he
went
up
behind
fouquet
the
man
who
had
delivered
the
note
looking
round
him
on
the
place
and
making
signs
to
several
persons
who
disappeared
in
the
adjacent
streets
after
having
themselves
repeated
the
signals
fouquet
was
made
to
wait
for
a
moment
on
the
terrace
of
which
we
have
spokena
terrace
which
abutted
on
the
little
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
the
cabinet
of
the
king
was
located
here
dartagnan
passed
on
before
the
surintendant
whom
till
that
time
he
had
respectfully
accompanied
and
entered
the
royal
cabinet
well
asked
louis
xiv
who
on
perceiving
him
threw
on
to
the
table
covered
with
papers
a
large
green
cloth
the
order
is
executed
sire
and
fouquet
monsieur
le
surintendant
follows
me
said
dartagnan
in
ten
minutes
let
him
be
introduced
said
the
king
dismissing
dartagnan
again
with
a
gesture
the
latter
retired
but
had
scarcely
reached
the
corridor
at
the
extremity
of
which
fouquet
was
waiting
for
him
when
he
was
recalled
by
the
kings
bell
did
he
not
appear
astonished
asked
the
king
who
sire
fouquet
replied
the
king
without
saying
monsieur
a
peculiarity
which
confirmed
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
in
his
suspicions
no
sire
replied
he
thats
well
and
a
second
time
louis
dismissed
dartagnan
fouquet
had
not
quitted
the
terrace
where
he
had
been
left
by
his
guide
he
reperused
his
note
conceived
thus
something
is
being
contrived
against
you
perhaps
they
will
not
dare
to
carry
it
out
at
the
castle
it
will
be
on
your
return
home
the
house
is
already
surrounded
by
musketeers
do
not
enter
a
white
horse
is
in
waiting
for
you
behind
the
esplanade
fouquet
recognized
the
writing
and
zeal
of
gourville
not
being
willing
that
if
any
evil
happened
to
himself
this
paper
should
compromise
a
faithful
friend
the
surintendant
was
busy
tearing
it
into
a
thousand
morsels
spread
about
by
the
wind
from
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
dartagnan
found
him
watching
the
snowflake
fluttering
of
the
last
scraps
in
space
monsieur
said
he
the
king
awaits
you
fouquet
walked
with
a
deliberate
step
along
the
little
corridor
where
mm
de
brienne
and
rose
were
at
work
whilst
the
duc
de
saintaignan
seated
on
a
chair
likewise
in
the
corridor
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
orders
with
feverish
impatience
his
sword
between
his
legs
it
appeared
strange
to
fouquet
that
mm
brienne
rose
and
de
saintaignan
in
general
so
attentive
and
obsequious
should
scarcely
take
the
least
notice
as
he
the
surintendant
passed
but
how
could
he
expect
to
find
it
otherwise
among
courtiers
he
whom
the
king
no
longer
called
anything
but
fouquet
he
raised
his
head
determined
to
look
every
one
and
everything
bravely
in
the
face
and
entered
the
kings
apartment
where
a
little
bell
which
we
already
know
had
already
announced
him
to
his
majesty
the
king
without
rising
nodded
to
him
and
with
interest
well
how
are
you
monsieur
fouquet
said
he
i
am
in
a
high
fever
replied
the
surintendant
but
i
am
at
the
kings
service
that
is
well
the
states
assemble
tomorrow
have
you
a
speech
ready
fouquet
looked
at
the
king
with
astonishment
i
have
not
sire
replied
he
but
i
will
improvise
one
i
am
too
well
acquainted
with
affairs
to
feel
any
embarrassment
i
have
only
one
question
to
ask
will
your
majesty
permit
me
certainly
ask
it
why
did
not
your
majesty
do
his
first
minister
the
honor
of
giving
him
notice
of
this
in
paris
you
were
ill
i
was
not
willing
to
fatigue
you
never
did
a
labornever
did
an
explanation
fatigue
me
sire
and
since
the
moment
is
come
for
me
to
demand
an
explanation
of
my
king
oh
monsieur
fouquet
an
explanation
an
explanation
pray
of
what
of
your
majestys
intentions
with
respect
to
myself
the
king
blushed
i
have
been
calumniated
continued
fouquet
warmly
and
i
feel
called
upon
to
adjure
the
justice
of
the
king
to
make
inquiries
you
say
all
this
to
me
very
uselessly
monsieur
fouquet
i
know
what
i
know
your
majesty
can
only
know
the
things
that
have
been
told
to
you
and
i
on
my
part
have
said
nothing
to
you
whilst
others
have
spoken
many
many
times
what
do
you
wish
to
say
said
the
king
impatient
to
put
an
end
to
this
embarrassing
conversation
i
will
go
straight
to
the
facts
sire
and
i
accuse
a
certain
man
of
having
injured
me
in
your
majestys
opinion
nobody
has
injured
you
monsieur
fouquet
that
reply
proves
to
me
sire
that
i
am
right
monsieur
fouquet
i
do
not
like
people
to
be
accused
not
when
one
is
accused
we
have
already
spoken
too
much
about
this
affair
your
majesty
will
not
allow
me
to
justify
myself
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
accuse
you
fouquet
with
a
halfbow
made
a
step
backward
it
is
certain
thought
he
that
he
has
made
up
his
mind
he
alone
who
cannot
go
back
can
show
such
obstinacy
not
to
see
the
danger
now
would
be
to
be
blind
indeed
not
to
shun
it
would
be
stupid
he
resumed
aloud
did
your
majesty
send
for
me
on
business
no
monsieur
fouquet
but
for
some
advice
i
wish
to
give
you
i
respectfully
await
it
sire
rest
yourself
monsieur
fouquet
do
not
throw
away
your
strength
the
session
of
the
states
will
be
short
and
when
my
secretaries
shall
have
closed
it
i
do
not
wish
business
to
be
talked
of
in
france
for
a
fortnight
has
the
king
nothing
to
say
to
me
on
the
subject
of
this
assembly
of
the
states
no
monsieur
fouquet
not
to
me
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
rest
yourself
i
beg
you
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
fouquet
bit
his
lips
and
hung
his
head
he
was
evidently
busy
with
some
uneasy
thought
this
uneasiness
struck
the
king
are
you
angry
at
having
to
rest
yourself
m
fouquet
said
he
yes
sire
i
am
not
accustomed
to
take
rest
but
you
are
ill
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
your
majesty
spoke
just
now
of
a
speech
to
be
pronounced
tomorrow
his
majesty
made
no
reply
this
unexpected
stroke
embarrassed
him
fouquet
felt
the
weight
of
this
hesitation
he
thought
he
could
read
danger
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
prince
which
fear
would
but
precipitate
if
i
appear
frightened
i
am
lost
thought
he
the
king
on
his
part
was
only
uneasy
at
the
alarm
of
fouquet
has
he
a
suspicion
of
anything
murmured
he
if
his
first
word
is
severe
again
thought
fouquet
if
he
becomes
angry
or
feigns
to
be
angry
for
the
sake
of
a
pretext
how
shall
i
extricate
myself
let
us
smooth
the
declivity
a
little
gourville
was
right
sire
said
he
suddenly
since
the
goodness
of
the
king
watches
over
my
health
to
the
point
of
dispensing
with
my
labor
may
i
not
be
allowed
to
be
absent
from
the
council
of
tomorrow
i
could
pass
the
day
in
bed
and
will
entreat
the
king
to
grant
me
his
physician
that
we
may
endeavor
to
find
a
remedy
against
this
fearful
fever
so
be
it
monsieur
fouquet
it
shall
be
as
you
desire
you
shall
have
a
holiday
tomorrow
you
shall
have
the
physician
and
shall
be
restored
to
health
thanks
said
fouquet
bowing
then
opening
his
game
shall
i
not
have
the
happiness
of
conducting
your
majesty
to
my
residence
of
belleisle
and
he
looked
louis
full
in
the
face
to
judge
of
the
effect
of
such
a
proposal
the
king
blushed
again
do
you
know
replied
he
endeavoring
to
smile
that
you
have
just
said
my
residence
of
belleisle
yes
sire
well
do
you
not
remember
continued
the
king
in
the
same
cheerful
tone
that
you
gave
me
belleisle
that
is
true
again
sire
only
as
you
have
not
taken
it
you
will
doubtless
come
with
me
and
take
possession
of
it
i
mean
to
do
so
that
was
besides
your
majestys
intention
as
well
as
mine
and
i
cannot
express
to
your
majesty
how
happy
and
proud
i
have
been
to
see
all
the
kings
regiments
from
paris
to
help
take
possession
the
king
stammered
out
that
he
did
not
bring
the
musketeers
for
that
alone
oh
i
am
convinced
of
that
said
fouquet
warmly
your
majesty
knows
very
well
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
come
alone
with
a
cane
in
your
hand
to
bring
to
the
ground
all
the
fortifications
of
belleisle
peste
cried
the
king
i
do
not
wish
those
fine
fortifications
which
cost
so
much
to
build
to
fall
at
all
no
let
them
stand
against
the
dutch
and
english
you
would
not
guess
what
i
want
to
see
at
belleisle
monsieur
fouquet
it
is
the
pretty
peasants
and
women
of
the
lands
on
the
seashore
who
dance
so
well
and
are
so
seducing
with
their
scarlet
petticoats
i
have
heard
great
boast
of
your
pretty
tenants
monsieur
le
surintendant
well
let
me
have
a
sight
of
them
whenever
your
majesty
pleases
have
you
any
means
of
transport
it
shall
be
tomorrow
if
you
like
the
surintendant
felt
this
stroke
which
was
not
adroit
and
replied
no
sire
i
was
ignorant
of
your
majestys
wish
above
all
i
was
ignorant
of
your
haste
to
see
belleisle
and
i
am
prepared
with
nothing
you
have
a
boat
of
your
own
nevertheless
i
have
five
but
they
are
all
in
port
or
at
paimboeuf
and
to
join
them
or
bring
them
hither
would
require
at
least
twentyfour
hours
have
i
any
occasion
to
send
a
courier
must
i
do
so
wait
a
little
put
an
end
to
the
feverwait
till
tomorrow
that
is
true
who
knows
but
that
by
tomorrow
we
may
not
have
a
hundred
other
ideas
replied
fouquet
now
perfectly
convinced
and
very
pale
the
king
started
and
stretched
his
hand
out
towards
his
little
bell
but
fouquet
prevented
his
ringing
sire
said
he
i
have
an
aguei
am
trembling
with
cold
if
i
remain
a
moment
longer
i
shall
most
likely
faint
i
request
your
majestys
permission
to
go
and
fling
myself
beneath
the
bedclothes
indeed
you
are
in
a
shiver
it
is
painful
to
behold
come
monsieur
fouquet
begone
i
will
send
to
inquire
after
you
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
with
kindness
in
an
hour
i
shall
be
better
i
will
call
some
one
to
reconduct
you
said
the
king
as
you
please
sire
i
would
gladly
take
the
arm
of
any
one
monsieur
dartagnan
cried
the
king
ringing
his
little
bell
oh
sire
interrupted
fouquet
laughing
in
such
a
manner
as
made
the

feel
cold
would
you
give
me
the
captain
of
your
musketeers
to
take
me
to
my
lodgings
an
equivocal
honor
that
sire
a
simple
footman
i
beg
and
why
m
fouquet
m
dartagnan
conducts
me
often
and
extremely
well
yes
but
when
he
conducts
you
sire
it
is
to
obey
you
whilst
me
go
on
if
i
am
obliged
to
return
home
supported
by
the
leader
of
the
musketeers
it
would
be
everywhere
said
you
had
had
me
arrested
arrested
replied
the
king
who
became
paler
than
fouquet
himselfarrested
oh
and
why
should
they
not
say
so
continued
fouquet
still
laughing
and
i
would
lay
a
wager
there
would
be
people
found
wicked
enough
to
laugh
at
it
this
sally
disconcerted
the
monarch
fouquet
was
skillful
enough
or
fortunate
enough
to
make
louis
xiv
recoil
before
the
appearance
of
the
deed
he
meditated
m
dartagnan
when
he
appeared
received
an
order
to
desire
a
musketeer
to
accompany
the
surintendant
quite
unnecessary
said
the
latter
sword
for
sword
i
prefer
gourville
who
is
waiting
for
me
below
but
that
will
not
prevent
me
enjoying
the
society
of
m
dartagnan
i
am
glad
he
will
see
belleisle
he
is
so
good
a
judge
of
fortifications
dartagnan
bowed
without
at
all
comprehending
what
was
going
on
fouquet
bowed
again
and
left
the
apartment
affecting
all
the
slowness
of
a
man
who
walks
with
difficulty
when
once
out
of
the
castle
i
am
saved
said
he
oh
yes
disloyal
king
you
shall
see
belleisle
but
it
shall
be
when
i
am
no
longer
there
he
disappeared
leaving
dartagnan
with
the
king
captain
said
the
king
you
will
follow
m
fouquet
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
yes
sire
he
is
going
to
his
lodgings
again
you
will
go
with
him
yes
sire
you
will
arrest
him
in
my
name
and
will
shut
him
up
in
a
carriage
in
a
carriage
well
sire
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
may
not
on
the
road
either
converse
with
any
one
or
throw
notes
to
people
he
may
meet
that
will
be
rather
difficult
sire
not
at
all
pardon
me
sire
i
cannot
stifle
m
fouquet
and
if
he
asks
for
liberty
to
breathe
i
cannot
prevent
him
by
closing
both
the
windows
and
the
blinds
he
will
throw
out
at
the
doors
all
the
cries
and
notes
possible
the
case
is
provided
for
monsieur
dartagnan
a
carriage
with
a
trellis
will
obviate
both
the
difficulties
you
point
out
a
carriage
with
an
iron
trellis
cried
dartagnan
but
a
carriage
with
an
iron
trellis
is
not
made
in
half
an
hour
and
your
majesty
commands
me
to
go
immediately
to
m
fouquets
lodgings
the
carriage
in
question
is
already
made
ah
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
said
the
captain
if
the
carriage
is
ready
made
very
well
then
we
have
only
to
set
it
in
motion
it
is
readyand
the
horses
harnessed
ah
and
the
coachman
with
the
outriders
is
waiting
in
the
lower
court
of
the
castle
dartagnan
bowed
there
only
remains
for
me
to
ask
your
majesty
whither
i
shall
conduct
m
fouquet
to
the
castle
of
angers
at
first
very
well
sire
afterwards
we
will
see
yes
sire
monsieur
dartagnan
one
last
word
you
have
remarked
that
for
making
this
capture
of
m
fouquet
i
have
not
employed
my
guards
on
which
account
m
de
gesvres
will
be
furious
your
majesty
does
not
employ
your
guards
said
the
captain
a
little
humiliated
because
you
mistrust
m
de
gesvres
that
is
all
that
is
to
say
monsieur
that
i
have
more
confidence
in
you
i
know
that
very
well
sire
and
it
is
of
no
use
to
make
so
much
of
it
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
arriving
at
this
monsieur
that
if
from
this
moment
it
should
happen
that
by
any
chance
whatever
m
fouquet
should
escapesuch
chances
have
been
monsieur
oh
very
often
sire
but
for
others
not
for
me
and
why
not
with
you
because
i
sire
have
for
an
instant
wished
to
save
m
fouquet
the
king
started
because
continued
the
captain
i
had
then
a
right
to
do
so
having
guessed
your
majestys
plan
without
you
having
spoken
to
me
of
it
and
that
i
took
an
interest
in
m
fouquet
now
was
i
not
at
liberty
to
show
my
interest
in
this
man
in
truth
monsieur
you
do
not
reassure
me
with
regard
to
your
services
if
i
had
saved
him
then
i
should
have
been
perfectly
innocent
i
will
say
more
i
should
have
done
well
for
m
fouquet
is
not
a
bad
man
but
he
was
not
willing
his
destiny
prevailed
he
let
the
hour
of
liberty
slip
by
so
much
the
worse
now
i
have
orders
i
will
obey
those
orders
and
m
fouquet
you
may
consider
as
a
man
arrested
he
is
at
the
castle
of
angers
this
very
m
fouquet
oh
you
have
not
got
him
yet
captain
that
concerns
me
every
one
to
his
trade
sire
only
once
more
reflect
do
you
seriously
give
me
orders
to
arrest
m
fouquet
sire
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
in
writing
sire
then
here
is
the
order
dartagnan
read
it
bowed
to
the
king
and
left
the
room
from
the
height
of
the
terrace
he
perceived
gourville
who
went
by
with
a
joyous
air
towards
the
lodgings
of

fouquet
chapter

the
white
horse
and
the
black
that
is
rather
surprising
said
dartagnan
gourville
running
about
the
streets
so
gayly
when
he
is
almost
certain
that
m
fouquet
is
in
danger
when
it
is
almost
equally
certain
that
it
was
gourville
who
warned
m
fouquet
just
now
by
the
note
which
was
torn
into
a
thousand
pieces
upon
the
terrace
and
given
to
the
winds
by
monsieur
le
surintendant
gourville
is
rubbing
his
hands
that
is
because
he
has
done
something
clever
whence
comes
m
gourville
gourville
is
coming
from
the
rue
aux
herbes
whither
does
the
rue
aux

lead
and
dartagnan
followed
along
the
tops
of
the
houses
of
nantes
dominated
by
the
castle
the
line
traced
by
the
streets
as
he
would
have
done
upon
a
topographical
plan
only
instead
of
the
dead
flat
paper
the
living
chart
rose
in
relief
with
the
cries
the
movements
and
the
shadows
of
men
and
things
beyond
the
inclosure
of
the
city
the
great
verdant
plains
stretched
out
bordering
the
loire
and
appeared
to
run
towards
the
pink
horizon
which
was
cut
by
the
azure
of
the
waters
and
the
dark
green
of
the
marshes
immediately
outside
the
gates
of
nantes
two
white
roads
were
seen
diverging
like
separate
fingers
of
a
gigantic
hand
dartagnan
who
had
taken
in
all
the
panorama
at
a
glance
by
crossing
the
terrace
was
led
by
the
line
of
the
rue
aux
herbes
to
the
mouth
of
one
of
those
roads
which
took
its
rise
under
the
gates
of
nantes
one
step
more
and
he
was
about
to
descend
the
stairs
take
his
trellised
carriage
and
go
towards
the
lodgings
of
m
fouquet
but
chance
decreed
at
the
moment
of
plunging
into
the
staircase
that
he
was
attracted
by
a
moving
point
then
gaining
ground
upon
that
road
what
is
that
said
the
musketeer
to
himself

no

what
a
rate
he
is
going
at
the
moving
point
became
detached
from
the
road
and
entered
into
the
fields
a
white
horse
continued
the
captain
who
had
just
observed
the
color
thrown
luminously
against
the
dark
ground
and
he
is
mounted
it
must
be
some
boy
whose
horse
is
thirsty
and
has
run
away
with
him
these
reflections
rapid
as
lightning
simultaneous
with
visual
perception
dartagnan
had
already
forgotten
when
he
descended
the
first
steps
of
the
staircase
some
morsels
of
paper
were
spread
over
the
stairs
and
shone
out
white
against
the
dirty
stones
eh
eh
said
the
captain
to
himself
here
are
some
of
the
fragments
of
the
note
torn
by
m
fouquet
poor
man
he
has
given
his
secret
to
the
wind
the
wind
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
and
brings
it
back
to
the
king

dartagnan
picked
up
one
of
these
morsels
of
paper
as
he
descended
gourvilles
pretty
little
hand
cried
he
whilst
examining
one
of
the
fragments
of
the
note
i
was
not
mistaken
and
he
read
the
word
horse
stop
said
he
and
he
examined
another
upon
which
there
was
not
a
letter
traced
upon
a
third
he
read
the
word
white
white
horse
repeated
he
like
a
child
that
is
spelling
ah
mordioux
cried
the
suspicious
spirit
a
white
horse
and
like
that
grain
of
powder
which
burning
dilates
into
ten
thousand
times
its
volume
dartagnan
enlightened
by
ideas
and
suspicions
rapidly
reascended
the
stairs
towards
the
terrace
the
white
horse
was
still
galloping
in
the
direction
of
the
loire
at
the
extremity
of
which
melting
into
the
vapors
of
the
water
a
little
sail
appeared
wavebalanced
like
a
waterbutterfly
oh
cried
the
musketeer
only
a
man
who
wants
to
fly
would
go
at
that
pace
across
plowed
lands
there
is
but
one
fouquet
a
financier
to
ride
thus
in
open
day
upon
a
white
horse
there
is
no
one
but
the
lord
of
belleisle
who
would
make
his
escape
towards
the
sea
while
there
are
such
thick
forests
on
land
and
there
is
but
one
dartagnan
in
the
world
to
catch
m
fouquet
who
has
half
an
hours
start
and
who
will
have
gained
his
boat
within
an
hour
this
being
said
the
musketeer
gave
orders
that
the
carriage
with
the
iron
trellis
should
be
taken
immediately
to
a
thicket
situated
just
outside
the
city
he
selected
his
best
horse
jumped
upon
his
back
galloped
along
the
rue
aux
herbes
taking
not
the
road
fouquet
had
taken
but
the
bank
itself
of
the
loire
certain
that
he
should
gain
ten
minutes
upon
the
total
distance
and
at
the
intersection
of
the
two
lines
come
up
with
the
fugitive
who
could
have
no
suspicion
of
being
pursued
in
that
direction
in
the
rapidity
of
the
pursuit
and
with
the
impatience
of
the
avenger
animating
himself
as
in
war
dartagnan
so
mild
so
kind
towards
fouquet
was
surprised
to
find
himself
become
ferociousalmost
sanguinary
for
a
long
time
he
galloped
without
catching
sight
of
the
white
horse
his
rage
assumed
fury
he
doubted
himselfhe
suspected
that
fouquet
had
buried
himself
in
some
subterranean
road
or
that
he
had
changed
the
white
horse
for
one
of
those
famous
black
ones
as
swift
as
the
wind
which
dartagnan
at
saintmande
had
so
frequently
admired
and
envied
for
their
vigor
and
their
fleetness
at
such
moments
when
the
wind
cut
his
eyes
so
as
to
make
the
tears
spring
from
them
when
the
saddle
had
become
burning
hot
when
the
galled
and
spurred
horse
reared
with
pain
and
threw
behind
him
a
shower
of
dust
and
stones
dartagnan
raising
himself
in
his
stirrups
and
seeing
nothing
on
the
waters
nothing
beneath
the
trees
looked
up
into
the
air
like
a
madman
he
was
losing
his
senses
in
the
paroxysms
of
eagerness
he
dreamt
of
aerial
waysthe
discovery
of
the
following
century
he
called
to
his
mind
daedalus
and
the
vast
wings
that
had
saved
him
from
the
prisons
of
crete
a
hoarse
sigh
broke
from
his
lips
as
he
repeated
devoured
by
the
fear
of
ridicule
i
i
duped
by
a
gourville
i
they
will
say
that
i
am
growing
oldthey
will
say
i
have
received
a
million
to
allow
fouquet
to
escape
and
he
again
dug
his
spurs
into
the
sides
of
his
horse
he
had
ridden
astonishingly
fast
suddenly
at
the
extremity
of
some
open
pastureground
behind
the
hedges
he
saw
a
white
form
which
showed
itself
disappeared
and
at
last
remained
distinctly
visible
against
the
rising
ground
dartagnans
heart
leaped
with
joy
he
wiped
the
streaming
sweat
from
his
brow
relaxed
the
tension
of
his
kneesby
which
the
horse
breathed
more
freelyand
gathering
up
his
reins
moderated
the
speed
of
the
vigorous
animal
his
active
accomplice
on
this
manhunt
he
had
then
time
to
study
the
direction
of
the
road
and
his
position
with
regard
to
fouquet
the
superintendent
had
completely
winded
his
horse
by
crossing
the
soft
ground
he
felt
the
necessity
of
gaining
a
firmer
footing
and
turned
towards
the
road
by
the
shortest
secant
line
dartagnan
on
his
part
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
ride
straight
on
concealed
by
the
sloping
shore
so
that
he
would
cut
his
quarry
off
the
road
when
he
came
up
with
him
then
the
real
race
would
beginthen
the
struggle
would
be
in
earnest
dartagnan
gave
his
horse
good
breathingtime
he
observed
that
the
superintendent
had
relaxed
into
a
trot
which
was
to
say
he
too
was
favoring
his
horse
but
both
of
them
were
too
much
pressed
for
time
to
allow
them
to
continue
long
at
that
pace
the
white
horse
sprang
off
like
an
arrow
the
moment
his
feet
touched
firm
ground
dartagnan
dropped
his
head
and
his
black
horse
broke
into
a
gallop
both
followed
the
same
route
the
quadruple
echoes
of
this
new
racecourse
were
confounded
fouquet
had
not
yet
perceived
dartagnan
but
on
issuing
from
the
slope
a
single
echo
struck
the
air
it
was
that
of
the
steps
of
dartagnans
horse
which
rolled
along
like
thunder
fouquet
turned
round
and
saw
behind
him
within
a
hundred
paces
his
enemy
bent
over
the
neck
of
his
horse
there
could
be
no
doubtthe
shining
baldrick
the
red
cassockit
was
a
musketeer
fouquet
slackened
his
hand
likewise
and
the
white
horse
placed
twenty
feet
more
between
his
adversary
and
himself
oh
but
thought
dartagnan
becoming
very
anxious
that
is
not
a
common
horse
m
fouquet
is
uponlet
us
see
and
he
attentively
examined
with
his
infallible
eye
the
shape
and
capabilities
of
the
courser
round
full
quartersa
thin
long
taillarge
hocksthin
legs
as
dry
as
bars
of
steelhoofs
hard
as
marble
he
spurred
his
own
but
the
distance
between
the
two
remained
the
same
dartagnan
listened
attentively
not
a
breath
of
the
horse
reached
him
and
yet
he
seemed
to
cut
the
air
the
black
horse
on
the
contrary
began
to
puff
like
any
blacksmiths
bellows
i
must
overtake
him
if
i
kill
my
horse
thought
the
musketeer
and
he
began
to
saw
the
mouth
of
the
poor
animal
whilst
he
buried
the
rowels
of
his
merciless
spurs
into
his
sides
the
maddened
horse
gained
twenty
toises
and
came
up
within
pistolshot
of
fouquet
courage
said
the
musketeer
to
himself
courage
the
white
horse
will
perhaps
grow
weaker
and
if
the
horse
does
not
fall
the
master
must
pull
up
at
last
but
horse
and
rider
remained
upright
together
gaining
ground
by
difficult
degrees
dartagnan
uttered
a
wild
cry
which
made
fouquet
turn
round
and
added
speed
to
the
white
horse
a
famous
horse
a
mad
rider
growled
the
captain
hola
mordioux
monsieur
fouquet
stop
in
the
kings
name
fouquet
made
no
reply
do
you
hear
me
shouted
dartagnan
whose
horse
had
just
stumbled
pardieu
replied
fouquet
laconically
and
rode
on
faster
dartagnan
was
nearly
mad
the
blood
rushed
boiling
to
his
temples
and
his
eyes
in
the
kings
name
cried
he
again
stop
or
i
will
bring
you
down
with
a
pistolshot
do
replied
fouquet
without
relaxing
his
speed
dartagnan
seized
a
pistol
and
cocked
it
hoping
that
the
double
click
of
the
spring
would
stop
his
enemy
you
have
pistols
likewise
said
he
turn
and
defend
yourself
fouquet
did
turn
round
at
the
noise
and
looking
dartagnan
full
in
the
face
opened
with
his
right
hand
the
part
of
his
dress
which
concealed
his
body
but
he
did
not
even
touch
his
holsters
there
were
not
more
than
twenty
paces
between
the
two
mordioux
said
dartagnan
i
will
not
assassinate
you
if
you
will
not
fire
upon
me
surrender
what
is
a
prison
i
would
rather
die
replied
fouquet
i
shall
suffer
less
dartagnan
drunk
with
despair
hurled
his
pistol
to
the
ground
i
will
take
you
alive
said
he
and
by
a
prodigy
of
skill
which
this
incomparable
horseman
alone
was
capable
he
threw
his
horse
forward
to
within
ten
paces
of
the
white
horse
already
his
hand
was
stretched
out
to
seize
his
prey
kill
me
kill
me
cried
fouquet
twould
be
more
humane
no
alivealive
murmured
the
captain
at
this
moment
his
horse
made
a
false
step
for
the
second
time
and
fouquets
again
took
the
lead
it
was
an
unheardof
spectacle
this
race
between
two
horses
which
now
only
kept
alive
by
the
will
of
their
riders
it
might
be
said
that
dartagnan
rode
carrying
his
horse
along
between
his
knees
to
the
furious
gallop
had
succeeded
the
fast
trot
and
that
had
sunk
to
what
might
be
scarcely
called
a
trot
at
all
but
the
chase
appeared
equally
warm
in
the
two
fatigued
athletoe
dartagnan
quite
in
despair
seized
his
second
pistol
and
cocked
it
at
your
horse
not
at
you
cried
he
to
fouquet
and
he
fired
the
animal
was
hit
in
the
quartershe
made
a
furious
bound
and
plunged
forward
at
that
moment
dartagnans
horse
fell
dead
i
am
dishonored
thought
the
musketeer
i
am
a
miserable
wretch
for
pitys
sake
m
fouquet
throw
me
one
of
your
pistols
that
i
may
blow
out
my
brains
but
fouquet
rode
away
for
mercys
sake
for
mercys
sake
cried
dartagnan
that
which
you
will
not
do
at
this
moment
i
myself
will
do
within
an
hour
but
here
upon
this
road
i
should
die
bravely
i
should
die
esteemed
do
me
that
service
m
fouquet
m
fouquet
made
no
reply
but
continued
to
trot
on
dartagnan
began
to
run
after
his
enemy
successively
he
threw
away
his
hat
his
coat
which
embarrassed
him
and
then
the
sheath
of
his
sword
which
got
between
his
legs
as
he
was
running
the
sword
in
his
hand
itself
became
too
heavy
and
he
threw
it
after
the
sheath
the
white
horse
began
to
rattle
in
its
throat
dartagnan
gained
upon
him
from
a
trot
the
exhausted
animal
sunk
to
a
staggering
walkthe
foam
from
his
mouth
was
mixed
with
blood
dartagnan
made
a
desperate
effort
sprang
towards
fouquet
and
seized
him
by
the
leg
saying
in
a
broken
breathless
voice
i
arrest
you
in
the
kings
name
blow
my
brains
out
if
you
like
we
have
both
done
our
duty
fouquet
hurled
far
from
him
into
the
river
the
two
pistols
dartagnan
might
have
seized
and
dismounting
from
his
horsei
am
your
prisoner
monsieur
said
he
will
you
take
my
arm
for
i
see
you
are
ready
to
faint
thanks
murmured
dartagnan
who
in
fact
felt
the
earth
sliding
from
under
his
feet
and
the
light
of
day
turning
to
blackness
around
him
then
he
rolled
upon
the
sand
without
breath
or
strength
fouquet
hastened
to
the
brink
of
the
river
dipped
some
water
in
his
hat
with
which
he
bathed
the
temples
of
the
musketeer
and
introduced
a
few
drop
between
his
lips
dartagnan
raised
himself
with
difficulty
and
looked
about
him
with
a
wandering
eye
he
beheld
fouquet
on
his
knees
with
his
wet
hat
in
his
hand
smiling
upon
him
with
ineffable
sweetness
you
are
not
off
then
cried
he
oh
monsieur
the
true
king
of
royalty
in
heart
in
soul
is
not
louis
of
the
louvre
or
philippe
of
saintemarguerite
it
is
you
proscribed
condemned
i
who
this
day
am
ruined
by
a
single
error
m
dartagnan
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
is
that
i
should
have
had
you
for
a
friend
but
how
shall
we
return
to
nantes
we
are
a
great
way
from
it
that
is
true
said
dartagnan
gloomily
the
white
horse
will
recover
perhaps
he
is
a
good
horse
mount
monsieur
dartagnan
i
will
walk
till
you
have
rested
a
little
poor
beast
and
wounded
too
said
the
musketeer
he
will
go
i
tell
you
i
know
him
but
we
can
do
better
still
let
us
both
get
up
and
ride
slowly
we
can
try
said
the
captain
but
they
had
scarcely
charged
the
animal
with
this
double
load
when
he
began
to
stagger
and
then
with
a
great
effort
walked
a
few
minutes
then
staggered
again
and
sank
down
dead
by
the
side
of
the
black
horse
which
he
had
just
managed
to
come
up
to
we
will
go
on
footdestiny
wills
it
sothe
walk
will
be
pleasant
said
fouquet
passing
his
arm
through
that
of
dartagnan
mordioux
cried
the
latter
with
a
fixed
eye
a
contracted
brow
and
a
swelling
heartwhat
a
disgraceful
day
they
walked
slowly
the
four
leagues
which
separated
them
from
the
little
wood
behind
which
the
carriage
and
escort
were
in
waiting
when
fouquet
perceived
that
sinister
machine
he
said
to
dartagnan
who
cast
down
his
eyes
ashamed
of
louis
xiv
there
is
an
idea
that
did
not
emanate
from
a
brave
man
captain
dartagnan
it
is
not
yours
what
are
these
gratings
for
said
he
to
prevent
your
throwing
letters
out
ingenious
but
you
can
speak
if
you
cannot
write
said
dartagnan
can
i
speak
to
you
why
certainly
if
you
wish
to
do
so
fouquet
reflected
for
a
moment
then
looking
the
captain
full
in
the
face
one
single
word
said
he
will
you
remember
it
i
will
not
forget

you
speak

in

and

the

rolled
through

in
which
the
squirrel
fallsthe
adder
flies
it
was
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
king
full
of
impatience
went
to
his
cabinet
on
the
terrace
and
kept
opening
the
door
of
the
corridor
to
see
what
his
secretaries
were
doing
m
colbert
seated
in
the

place

so
long
occupied
in
the
morning
was
chatting
in
a
low
voice
with
m
de
brienne
the
king
opened
the
door
suddenly
and
addressed
them
what
is
it
you
are
saying
we
were
speaking
of
the
first
sitting
of
the
states
said
m
de
brienne
rising
very
well
replied
the
king
and
returned
to
his
room
five
minutes
after
the
summons
of

bell

whose
hour
it
was

you
finished

see
if

returned

it
is
very
strange
murmured
the
king
call
m
colbert
colbert
entered
he
had
been
expecting
this
all
the
morning
monsieur
colbert
said
the
king
very
sharply
you
must
ascertain
what
has
become
of
m
dartagnan
colbert
in
his
calm
voice
replied
where
does
your
majesty
desire
him
to
be
sought
for
eh
monsieur
do
you
not
know
on
what
i
have
sent
him
replied
louis
acrimoniously
your
majesty
did
not
inform
me
monsieur
there
are
things
that
must
be
guessed
and
you
above
all
are
apt
to
guess
them
i
might
have
been
able
to
imagine
sire
but
i
do
not
presume
to
be
positive
colbert
had
not
finished
these
words
when
a
rougher
voice
than
that
of
the
king
interrupted
the
interesting
conversation
thus
begun
between
the
monarch
and
his
clerk
dartagnan
cried
the
king
with
evident
joy
dartagnan
pale
and
in
evidently
bad
humor
cried
to
the
king
as
he
entered
sire
is
it
your
majesty
who
has
given
orders
to
my
musketeers
what
orders
said
the

about

none
replied

said
dartagnan
biting
his
mustache
i
was
not
mistaken
then
it
was
monsieur
here
and
he
pointed
to
colbert
what
orders

monsieur
dartagnan
said
the
king
sternly
take
care
it
is
not
in
my
presence
that
such
explanations
and
made
in
such
a
tone
should
take
place
i
have
acted
for
the
good
of
the
king
said
colbert
in
a
faltering
voice
it
is
hard
to
be
so
treated
by
one
of
your
majestys
officers
and
that
without
redress
on
account
of
the
respect
i
owe
the
king
the
respect
you
owe
the
king
cried
dartagnan
his
eyes
flashing
fire
consists
in
the
first
place
in
making
his
authority
respected
and
his
person
beloved
every
agent
of
a
power
without
control
represents
that
power
and
when
people
curse
the
hand
which
strikes
them
it
is
the
royal
hand
that
god
reproaches
do
you
hear
must
a
soldier
hardened
by
forty
years
of
wounds
and
blood
give
you
this
lesson
monsieur
must
mercy
be
on
my
side
and
ferocity
on
yours
you
have
caused
the
innocent
to
be
arrested
bound
and
imprisoned
accomplices
perhaps
of
m
fouquet
said
colbert
who
told
you
m
fouquet
had
accomplices
or
even
that
he
was
guilty
the
king
alone
knows
that
his
justice
is
not
blind
when
he
says
arrest
and
imprison
such
and
such
a
man
he
is
obeyed
do
not
talk
to
me
then
any
more
of
the
respect
you
owe
the
king
and
be
careful
of
your
words
that
they
may
not
chance
to
convey
the
slightest
menace
for
the
king
will
not
allow
those
to
be
threatened
who
do
him
service
by
others
who
do
him
disservice
and
if
in
case
i
should
have
which
god
forbid
a
master
so
ungrateful
i
would
make
myself
respected
thus
saying
dartagnan
took
his
station
haughtily
in
the
kings
cabinet
his
eyes
flashing
his
hand
on
his
sword
his
lips
trembling
affecting
much
more
anger
than
he
really
felt
colbert
humiliated
and
devoured
with
rage
bowed
to
the
king
as
if
to
ask
his
permission
to
leave
the
room
the
king
thwarted
alike
in
pride
and
in
curiosity
knew
not
which
part
to
take
dartagnan
saw
him
hesitate
to
remain
longer
would
have
been
a
mistake
it
was
necessary
to
score
a
triumph
over
colbert
and
the
only
method
was
to
touch
the
king
so
near
the
quick
that
his
majesty
would
have
no
other
means
of
extrication
but
choosing
between
the
two
antagonists
dartagnan
bowed
as
colbert
had
done
but
the
king
who
in
preference
to
everything
else
was
anxious
to
have
all
the
exact
details
of
the
arrest
of
the
surintendant
of
the
finances
from
him
who
had
made
him
tremble
for
a
momentthe
king
perceiving
that
the
illhumor
of
dartagnan
would
put
off
for
half
an
hour
at
least
the
details
he
was
burning
to
be
acquainted
withlouis
we
say
forgot
colbert
who
had
nothing
new
to
tell
him
and
recalled
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
in
the
first
place
said
he
let
me
see
the
result
of
your
commission
monsieur
you
may
rest
yourself
hereafter
dartagnan
who
was
just
passing
through
the
doorway
stopped
at
the
voice
of
the
king
retraced
his
steps
and
colbert
was
forced
to
leave
the
closet
his
countenance
assumed
almost
a
purple
hue
his
black
and
threatening
eyes
shone
with
a
dark
fire
beneath
their
thick
brows
he
stepped
out
bowed
before
the
king
half
drew
himself
up
in
passing
dartagnan
and
went
away
with
death
in
his
heart
dartagnan
on
being
left
alone
with
the
king
softened
immediately
and
composing
his
countenance
sire
said
he
you
are
a
young
king
it
is
by
the
dawn
that
people
judge
whether
the
day
will
be
fine
or
dull
how
sire
will
the
people
whom
the
hand
of
god
has
placed
under
your
law
argue
of
your
reign
if
between
them
and
you
you
allow
angry
and
violent
ministers
to
interpose
their
mischief
but
let
us
speak
of
myself
sire
let
us
leave
a
discussion
that
may
appear
idle
and
perhaps
inconvenient
to
you
let
us
speak
of
myself
i
have
arrested
m
fouquet
you
took
plenty
of
time
about
it
said
the
king
sharply
dartagnan
looked
at
the
king
i
perceive
that
i
have
expressed
myself
badly
i
announced
to
your
majesty
that
i
had
arrested
monsieur
fouquet
you
did
and
what
then
well
i
ought
to
have
told
your
majesty
that
m
fouquet
had
arrested
me
that
would
have
been
more
just
i
reestablish
the
truth
then
i
have
been
arrested
by
m
fouquet
it
was
now
the
turn
of
louis
xiv
to
be
surprised
his
majesty
was
astonished
in
his
turn
dartagnan
with
his
quick
glance
appreciated
what
was
passing
in
the
heart
of
his
master
he
did
not
allow
him
time
to
put
any
questions
he
related
with
that
poetry
that
picturesqueness
which
perhaps
he
alone
possessed
at
that
period
the
escape
of
fouquet
the
pursuit
the
furious
race
and
lastly
the
inimitable
generosity
of
the
surintendant
who
might
have
fled
ten
times
over
who
might
have
killed
the
adversary
in
the
pursuit
but
who
had
preferred
imprisonment
perhaps
worse
to
the
humiliation
of
one
who
wished
to
rob
him
of
his
liberty
in
proportion
as
the
tale
advanced
the
king
became
agitated
devouring
the
narrators
words
and
drumming
with
his
fingernails
upon
the
table
it
results
from
all
this
sire
in
my
eyes
at
least
that
the
man
who
conducts
himself
thus
is
a
gallant
man
and
cannot
be
an
enemy
to
the
king
that
is
my
opinion
and
i
repeat
it
to
your
majesty
i
know
what
the
king
will
say
to
me
and
i
bow
to
itreasons
of
state
so
be
it
to
my
ears
that
sounds
highly
respectable
but
i
am
a
soldier
and
i
have
received
my
orders
my
orders
are
executedvery
unwillingly
on
my
part
it
is
true
but
they
are
executed
i
say
no
more
where
is
m
fouquet
at
this
moment
asked
louis
after
a
short
silence
m
fouquet
sire
replied
dartagnan
is
in
the
iron
cage
that
m
colbert
had
prepared
for
him
and
is
galloping
as
fast
as
four
strong
horses
can
drag
him
towards
angers
why
did
you
leave
him
on
the
road
because
your
majesty
did
not
tell
me
to
go
to
angers
the
proof
the
best
proof
of
what
i
advance
is
that
the
king
desired
me
to
be
sought
for
but
this
minute
and
then
i
had
another
reason
what
is
that
whilst
i
was
with
him
poor
m
fouquet
would
never
attempt
to
escape
well
cried
the
king
astonished
your
majesty
ought
to
understand
and
does
understand
certainly
that
my
warmest
wish
is
to
know
that
m
fouquet
is
at
liberty
i
have
given
him
one
of
my
brigadiers
the
most
stupid
i
could
find
among
my
musketeers
in
order
that
the
prisoner
might
have
a
chance
of
escaping
are
you
mad
monsieur
dartagnan
cried
the
king
crossing
his
arms
on
his
breast
do
people
utter
such
enormities
even
when
they
have
the
misfortune
to
think
them
ah
sire
you
cannot
expect
that
i
should
be
an
enemy
to
m
fouquet
after
what
he
has
just
done
for
you
and
me
no
no
if
you
desire
that
he
should
remain
under
your
lock
and
bolt
never
give
him
in
charge
to
me
however
closely
wired
might
be
the
cage
the
bird
would
in
the
end
take
wing
i
am
surprised
said
the
king
in
his
sternest
tone
you
did
not
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
man
m
fouquet
wished
to
place
upon
my
throne
you
had
in
him
all
you
wantaffection
gratitude
in
my
service
monsieur
you
will
only
find
a
master
if
m
fouquet
had
not
gone
to
seek
you
in
the
bastile
sire
replied
dartagnan
with
a
deeply
impressive
manner
one
single
man
would
have
gone
there
and
i
should
have
been
that
manyou
know
that
right
well
sire
the
king
was
brought
to
a
pause
before
that
speech
of
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
so
frankly
spoken
and
so
true
the
king
had
nothing
to
offer
on
hearing
dartagnan
louis
remembered
the
dartagnan
of
former
times
him
who
at
the
palais
royal
held
himself
concealed
behind
the
curtains
of
his
bed
when
the
people
of
paris
led
by
cardinal
de
retz
came
to
assure
themselves
of
the
presence
of
the
king
the
dartagnan
whom
he
saluted
with
his
hand
at
the
door
of
his
carriage
when
repairing
to
notre
dame
on
his
return
to
paris
the
soldier
who
had
quitted
his
service
at
blois
the
lieutenant
he
had
recalled
to
be
beside
his
person
when
the
death
of
mazarin
restored
his
power
the
man
he
had
always
found
loyal
courageous
devoted
louis
advanced
towards
the
door
and
called
colbert
colbert
had
not
left
the
corridor
where
the
secretaries
were
at
work
he
reappeared
colbert
did
you
make
a
perquisition
on
the
house
of
m
fouquet
yes
sire
what
has
it
produced
m
de
roncherolles
who
was
sent
with
your
majestys
musketeers
has
remitted
me
some
papers
replied
colbert
i
will
look
at
them
give
me
your
hand
my
hand
sire
yes
that
i
may
place
it
in
that
of
m
dartagnan
in
fact
m
dartagnan
added
he
with
a
smile
turning
towards
the
soldier
who
at
sight
of
the
clerk
had
resumed
his
haughty
attitude
you
do
not
know
this
man
make
his
acquaintance
and
he
pointed
to
colbert
he
has
been
made
but
a
moderately
valuable
servant
in
subaltern
positions
but
he
will
be
a
great
man
if
i
raise
him
to
the
foremost
rank
sire
stammered
colbert
confused
with
pleasure
and
fear
i
always
understood
why
murmured
dartagnan
in
the
kings
ear
he
was
jealous
precisely
and
his
jealousy
confined
his
wings
he
will
henceforward
be
a
wingedserpent
grumbled
the
musketeer
with
a
remnant
of
hatred
against
his
recent
adversary
but
colbert
approaching
him
offered
to
his
eyes
a
physiognomy
so
different
from
that
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
him
wear
he
appeared
so
good
so
mild
so
easy
his
eyes
took
the
expression
of
an
intelligence
so
noble
that
dartagnan
a
connoisseur
in
physiognomies
was
moved
and
almost
changed
in
his
convictions
colbert
pressed
his
hand
that
which
the
king
has
just
told
you
monsieur
proves
how
well
his
majesty
is
acquainted
with
men
the
inveterate
opposition
i
have
displayed
up
to
this
day
against
abuses
and
not
against
men
proves
that
i
had
it
in
view
to
prepare
for
my
king
a
glorious
reign
for
my
country
a
great
blessing
i
have
many
ideas
m
dartagnan
you
will
see
them
expand
in
the
sun
of
public
peace
and
if
i
have
not
the
good
fortune
to
conquer
the
friendship
of
honest
men
i
am
at
least
certain
monsieur
that
i
shall
obtain
their
esteem
for
their
admiration
monsieur
i
would
give
my
life
this
change
this
sudden
elevation
this
mute
approbation
of
the
king
gave
the
musketeer
matter
for
profound
reflection
he
bowed
civilly
to
colbert
who
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
the
king
when
he
saw
they
were
reconciled
dismissed
them
they
left
the
room
together
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
cabinet
the
new
minister
stopping
the
captain
said
is
it
possible
m
dartagnan
that
with
such
an
eye
as
yours
you
did
not
at
the
first
glance
at
the
first
impression
discover
what
sort
of
man
i
am
monsieur
colbert
replied
the
musketeer
a
ray
of
the
sun
in
our
eyes
prevents
us
from
seeing
the
most
vivid
flame
the
man
in
power
radiates
you
know
and
since
you
are
there
why
should
you
continue
to
persecute
him
who
had
just
fallen
into
disgrace
and
fallen
from
such
a
height
i
monsieur
said
colbert
oh
monsieur
i
would
never
persecute
him
i
wished
to
administer
the
finances
and
to
administer
them
alone
because
i
am
ambitious
and
above
all
because
i
have
the
most
entire
confidence
in
my
own
merit
because
i
know
that
all
the
gold
of
this
country
will
ebb
and
flow
beneath
my
eyes
and
i
love
to
look
at
the
kings
gold
because
if
i
live
thirty
years
in
thirty
years
not
a
denir
of
it
will
remain
in
my
hands
because
with
that
gold
i
will
build
granaries
castles
cities
and
harbors
because
i
will
create
a
marine
i
will
equip
navies
that
shall
waft
the
name
of
france
to
the
most
distant
people
because
i
will
create
libraries
and
academies
because
i
will
make
france
the
first
country
in
the
world
and
the
wealthiest
these
are
the
motives
for
my
animosity
against
m
fouquet
who
prevented
my
acting
and
then
when
i
shall
be
great
and
strong
when
france
is
great
and
strong
in
my
turn
then
will
i
cry
mercy
mercy
did
you
say
then
ask
his
liberty
of
the
king
the
king
is
only
crushing
him
on
your
account
colbert
again
raised
his
head
monsieur
said
he
you
know
that
is
not
so
and
that
the
king
has
his
own
personal
animosity
against
m
fouquet
it
is
not
for
me
to
teach
you
that
but
the
king
will
grow
tired
he
will
forget
the
king
never
forgets
m
dartagnan
hark
the
king
calls
he
is
going
to
issue
an
order
i
have
not
influenced
him
have
i
listen
the
king
in
fact
was
calling
his
secretaries
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
i
am
here
sire
give
twenty
of
your
musketeers
to
m
de
saintaignan
to
form
a
guard
for
m
fouquet
dartagnan
and
colbert
exchanged
looks
and
from
angers
continued
the
king
they
will
conduct
the
prisoner
to
the
bastile
in
paris
you
were
right
said
the
captain
to
the
minister
saintaignan
continued
the
king
you
will
have
any
one
shot
who
shall
attempt
to
speak
privately
with
m
fouquet
during
the
journey
but
myself
sire
said
the
duke
you
monsieur
you
will
only
speak
to
him
in
the
presence
of
the
musketeers
the
duke
bowed
and
departed
to
execute
his
commission
dartagnan
was
about
to
retire
likewise
but
the
king
stopped
him
monsieur
said
he
you
will
go
immediately
and
take
possession
of
the
isle
and
fief
of
belleileenmer
yes
sire
alone
you
will
take
a
sufficient
number
of
troops
to
prevent
delay
in
case
the
place
should
be
contumacious
a
murmur
of
courtly
incredulity
rose
from
the
group
of
courtiers
that
shall
be
done
said
dartagnan
i
saw
the
place
in
my
infancy
resumed
the
king
and
i
do
not
wish
to
see
it
again
you
have
heard
me
go
monsieur
and
do
not
return
without
the
keys
colbert
went
up
to
dartagnan
a
commission
which
if
you
carry
it
out
well
said
he
will
be
worth
a
marechals
baton
to
you
why
do
you
employ
the
words
if
you
carry
it
out
well
because
it
is
difficult
ah
in
what
respect
you
have
friends
in
belleisle
monsieur
dartagnan
and
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
for
men
like
you
to
march
over
the
bodies
of
their
friends
to
obtain
success
dartagnan
hung
his
head
in
deepest
thought
whilst
colbert
returned
to
the
king
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
captain
received
the
written
order
from
the
king
to
blow
up
the
fortress
of
belleisle
in
case
of
resistance
with
power
of
life
and
death
over
all
the
inhabitants
or
refugees
and
an
injunction
not
to
allow
one
to
escape
colbert
was
right
thought
dartagnan
for
me
the
baton
of
a
marechal
of
france
will
cost
the
lives
of
my
two
friends
only
they
seem
to
forget
that
my
friends
are
not
more
stupid
than
the
birds
and
that
they
will
not
wait
for
the
hand
of
the
fowler
to
extend
over
their
wings
i
will
show
them
that
hand
so
plainly
that
they
will
have
quite
time
enough
to
see
it
poor
porthos
poor
aramis
no
my
fortune
should
shall
not
cost
your
wings
a
feather
having
thus
determined
dartagnan
assembled
the
royal
army
embarked
it
at
paimboeuf
and
set
sail
without
the
loss
of
an
unnecessary
minute
chapter
xlii
belleileenmer
at
the
extremity
of
the
mole
against
which
the
furious
sea
beats
at
the
evening
tide
two
men
holding
each
other
by
the
arm
were
conversing
in
an
animated
and
expansive
tone
without
the
possibility
of
any
other
human
being
hearing
their
words
borne
away
as
they
were
one
by
one
by
the
gusts
of
wind
with
the
white
foam
swept
from
the
crests
of
the
waves
the
sun
had
just
gone
down
in
the
vast
sheet
of
the
crimsoned
ocean
like
a
gigantic
crucible
from
time
to
time
one
of
these
men
turning
towards
the
east
cast
an
anxious
inquiring
look
over
the
sea
the
other
interrogating
the
features
of
his
companion
seemed
to
seek
for
information
in
his
looks
then
both
silent
busied
with
dismal
thoughts
they
resumed
their
walk
every
one
has
already
perceived
that
these
two
men
were
our
proscribed
heroes
porthos
and
aramis
who
had
taken
refuge
in
belleisle
since
the
ruin
of
their
hopes
since
the
discomfiture
of
the
colossal
schemes
of
m
dherblay
if
is
of
no
use
your
saying
anything
to
the
contrary
my
dear
aramis
repeated
porthos
inhaling
vigorously
the
salt
breeze
with
which
he
charged
his
massive
chest
it
is
of
no
use
aramis
the
disappearance
of
all
the
fishingboats
that
went
out
two
days
ago
is
not
an
ordinary
circumstance
there
has
been
no
storm
at
sea
the
weather
has
been
constantly
calm
not
even
the
lightest
gale
and
even
if
we
had
had
a
tempest
all
our
boats
would
not
have
foundered
i
repeat
it
is
strange
this
complete
disappearance
astonishes
me
i
tell
you
true
murmured
aramis
you
are
right
friend
porthos
it
is
true
there
is
something
strange
in
it
and
further
added
porthos
whose
ideas
the
assent
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
seemed
to
enlarge
and
further
do
you
not
observe
that
if
the
boats
have
perished
not
a
single
plank
has
washed
ashore
i
have
remarked
it
as
well
as
yourself
and
do
you
not
think
it
strange
that
the
two
only
boats
we
had
left
in
the
whole
island
and
which
i
sent
in
search
of
the
others
aramis
here
interrupted
his
companion
by
a
cry
and
by
so
sudden
a
movement
that
porthos
stopped
as
if
he
were
stupefied
what
do
you
say
porthos
whatyou
have
sent
the
two
boats
in
search
of
the
others
yes
to
be
sure
i
have
replied
porthos
calmly
unhappy
man
what
have
you
done
then
we
are
indeed
lost
cried
the
bishop
lostwhat
did
you
say
exclaimed
the
terrified
porthos
how
lost
aramis
how
are
we
lost
aramis
bit
his
lips
nothing
nothing
your
pardon
i
meant
to
say
what
that
if
we
were
inclinedif
we
took
a
fancy
to
make
an
excursion
by
sea
we
could
not
very
good
and
why
should
that
vex
you
a
precious
pleasure
ma
foi
for
my
part
i
dont
regret
it
at
all
what
i
regret
is
certainly
not
the
more
or
less
amusement
we
can
find
at
belleisle
what
i
regret
aramis
is

here
we
are
not
in

my
dear
friend
we
arei
know
not
where
oh
i
tell
you
in
full
sincerity
of
soul
and
your
affection
will
excuse
my
frankness
but
i
declare
to
you
i
am
not
happy
at
belleisle
no
in
good
truth
i
am
not
happy
aramis
breathed
a
long
but
stifled
sigh
dear
friend
replied
he
that
is
why
it
is
so
sad
a
thing
you
have
sent
the
two
boats
we
had
left
in
search
of
the
boats
which
disappeared
two
days
ago
if
you
had
not
sent
them
away
we
would
have
departed
departed
and
the
orders
aramis
what
orders
parbleu
why
the
orders
you
have
been
constantly
in
and
out
of
season
repeating
to
methat
we
were
to
hold
belleisle
against
the
usurper
you
know
very
well
that
is
true
murmured
aramis
again
you
see
then
plainly
my
friend
that
we
could
not
depart
and
that
the
sending
away
of
the
boats
in
search
of
the
others
cannot
prove
prejudicial
to
us
in
the
very
least
aramis
was
silent
and
his
vague
glances
luminous
as
that
of
an
albatross
hovered
for
a
long
time
over
the
sea
interrogating
space
seeking
to
pierce
the
very
horizon
with
all
that
aramis
continued
porthos
who
adhered
to
his
idea
and
that
the
more
closely
from
the
bishop
having
apparently
endorsed
itwith
all
that
you
give
me
no
explanation
about
what
can
have
happened
to
these
unfortunate
boats
i
am
assailed
by
cries
and
complaints
whichever
way
i
go
the
children
cry
to
see
the
desolation
of
the
women
as
if
i
could
restore
the
absent
husbands
and
fathers
what
do
you
suppose
my
friend
and
how
ought
i
to
answer
them
think
all
you
like
my
good
porthos
and
say
nothing
this
reply
did
not
satisfy
porthos
at
all
he
turned
away
grumbling
something
in
illhumor
aramis
stopped
the
valiant
musketeer
do
you
remember
said
he
in
a
melancholy
tone
kneading
the
two
hands
of
the
giant
between
his
own
with
affectionate
cordiality
do
you
remember
my
friend
that
in
the
glorious
days
of
youthdo
you
remember
porthos
when
we
were
all
strong
and
valiantwe
and
the
other
twoif
we
had
then
had
an
inclination
to
return
to
france
do
you
think
this
sheet
of
salt
water
would
have
stopped
us
oh
said
porthos
but
six
leagues
if
you
had
seen
me
get
astride
of
a
plank
would
you
have
remained
on
land
porthos
no
pardieu
no
aramis
but
nowadays
what
sort
of
a
plank
should
we
want
my
friend
i
in
particular
and
the
seigneur
de
bracieux
cast
a
profound
glance
over
his
colossal
rotundity
with
a
loud
laugh
and
do
you
mean
seriously
to
say
you
are
not
tired
of
belleisle
a
little
and
that
you
would
not
prefer
the
comforts
of
your
dwellingof
your
episcopal
palace
at
vannes
come
confess
no
replied
aramis
without
daring
to
look
at
porthos
let
us
stay
where
we
are
then
said
his
friend
with
a
sigh
which
in
spite
of
the
efforts
he
made
to
restrain
it
escaped
his
echoing
breast
let
us
remainlet
us
remain
and
yet
added
he
and
yet
if
we
seriously
wished
but
that
decidedlyif
we
had
a
fixed
idea
one
firmly
taken
to
return
to
france
and
there
were
not
boats
have
you
remarked
another
thing
my
friendthat
is
since
the
disappearance
of
our
barks
during
the
last
two
days
absence
of
fishermen
not
a
single
small
boat
has
landed
on
the
shores
of
the
isle
yes
certainly
you
are
right
i
too
have
remarked
it
and
the
observation
was
the
more
naturally
made
for
before
the
last
two
fatal
days
barks
and
shallops
were
as
plentiful
as
shrimps
i
must
inquire
said
aramis
suddenly
and
with
great
agitation
and
then
if
we
had
a
raft
constructed
but
there
are
some
canoes
my
friend
shall
i
board
one
a
canoea
canoe
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
porthos
a
canoe
to
be
upset
in
no
no
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
it
is
not
our
trade
to
ride
upon
the
waves
we
will
wait
we
will
wait
and
aramis
continued
walking
about
with
increased
agitation
porthos
who
grew
tired
of
following
all
the
feverish
movements
of
his
friendporthos
who
in
his
faith
and
calmness
understood
nothing
of
the
sort
of
exasperation
which
was
betrayed
by
his
companions
continual
convulsive
startsporthos
stopped
him
let
us
sit
down
upon
this
rock
said
he
place
yourself
there
close
to
me
aramis
and
i
conjure
you
for
the
last
time
to
explain
to
me
in
a
manner
i
can
comprehendexplain
to
me
what
we
are
doing
here
porthos
said
aramis
much
embarrassed
i
know
that
the
false
king
wished
to
dethrone
the
true
king
that
is
a
fact
that
i
understand
well
yes
said
aramis
i
know
that
the
false
king
formed
the
project
of
selling
belleisle
to
the
english
i
understand
that
too
yes
i
know
that
we
engineers
and
captains
came
and
threw
ourselves
into
belleisle
to
take
direction
of
the
works
and
the
command
of
ten
companies
levied
and
paid
by
m
fouquet
or
rather
the
ten
companies
of
his
soninlaw
all
that
is
plain
aramis
rose
in
a
state
of
great
impatience
he
might
be
said
to
be
a
lion
importuned
by
a
gnat
porthos
held
him
by
the
arm
but
what
i
cannot
understand
what
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
my
mind
and
all
my
reflections
i
cannot
comprehend
and
never
shall
comprehend
is
that
instead
of
sending
us
troops
instead
of
sending
us
reinforcements
of
men
munitions
provisions
they
leave
us
without
boats
they
leave
belleisle
without
arrivals
without
help
it
is
that
instead
of
establishing
with
us
a
correspondence
whether
by
signals
or
written
or
verbal
communications
all
relations
with
the
shore
are
intercepted
tell
me
aramis
answer
me
or
rather
before
answering
me
will
you
allow
me
to
tell
you
what
i
have
thought
will
you
hear
what
my
idea
is
the
plan
i
have
conceived
the
bishop
raised
his
head
well
aramis
continued
porthos
i
have
dreamed
i
have
imagined
that
an
event
has
taken
place
in
france
i
dreamt
of
m
fouquet
all
the
night
of
lifeless
fish
of
broken
eggs
of
chambers
badly
furnished
meanly
kept
villainous
dreams
my
dear
dherblay
very
unlucky
such
dreams
porthos
what
is
that
yonder
interrupted
aramis
rising
suddenly
and
pointing
out
to
his
friend
a
black
spot
upon
the
empurpled
line
of
the
water
a
bark
said
porthos
yes
it
is
a
bark
ah
we
shall
have
some
news
at
last
there
are
two
cried
the
bishop
on
discovering
another
mast
two

said
porthos
in
his
turn
six
seven
ah
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
it
is
a
fleet
our
boats
returning
probably
said
aramis
very
uneasily
in
spite
of
the
assurance
he
affected
they
are
very
large
for
fishingboats
observed
porthos
and
do
you
not
remark
my
friend
that
they
come
from
the
loire
they
come
from
the
loireyes
and
look
everybody
here
sees
them
as
well
as
ourselves
look
women
and
children
are
beginning
to
crowd
the
jetty
an
old
fisherman
passed
are
those
our
barks
yonder
asked
aramis
the
old
man
looked
steadily
into
the
eye
of
the
horizon
no

replied
he

replied
aramis
starting
how
do
you
know
that
said
he
by
the
flag
but
said
porthos
the
boat
is
scarcely
visible
how
the
devil
my
friend
can
you
distinguish
the

i
see
there
is
one
replied
the
old
man

sort
of
craft

generally
used
for
transport
of

ah
groaned
aramis
vivat
cried
porthos
they
are
sending
us
reinforcements
dont
you
think
they
are
aramis
probably
unless
it
is
the
english
coming
by
the
loire
that
would
have
an
evil
look
porthos
for
they
must
have
come
through
paris
you
are
right
they
are
reinforcements
decidedly
or
provisions
aramis
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
made
no
reply
then
all
at
onceporthos
said
he
have
the
alarm
sounded
the
alarm
do
you
imagine
such
a
thing
yes
and
let
the
cannoniers
mount
their
batteries
the
artillerymen
be
at
their
pieces
and
be
particularly
watchful
of
the
coast
batteries
porthos
opened
his
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
he
looked
attentively
at
his
friend
to
convince
himself
he
was
in
his
proper
senses
i
will
do
it
my
dear
porthos
continued
aramis
in
his
blandest
tone
i
will
go
and
have
these
orders
executed
myself
if
you
do
not
go
my
friend
well
i
willinstantly
said
porthos
who
went
to
execute
the
orders
casting
all
the
while
looks
behind
him
to
see
if
the
bishop
of
vannes
were
not
deceived
and
if
on
recovering
more
rational
ideas
he
would
not
recall
him
the
alarm
was
sounded
trumpets
brayed
drums
rolled
the
great
bronze
bell
swung
in
horror
from
its
lofty
belfry
the
dikes
and
moles
were
quickly
filled
with
the
curious
and
soldiers
matches
sparkled
in
the
hands
of
the
artillerymen
placed
behind
the
large
cannon
bedded
in
their
stone
carriages
when
every
man
was
at
his
post
when
all
the
preparations
for
defense
were
made
permit
me
aramis
to
try
to
comprehend
whispered
porthos
timidly
in
aramiss
ear
my
dear
friend
you
will
comprehend
but
too
soon
murmured
m
dherblay
in
reply
to
this
question
of
his
lieutenant
the
fleet
which
is
coming
yonder
with
sails
unfurled
straight
towards
the
port
of
belleisle
is
a
royal
fleet
is
it
not
but
as
there
are
two
kings
in
france
porthos
to
which
of
these
two
kings
does
this
fleet
belong
oh
you
open
my
eyes
replied
the
giant
stunned
by
the
insinuation
and
porthos
whose
eyes
this
reply
of
his
friends
had
at
last
opened
or
rather
thickened
the
bandage
which
covered
his
sight
went
with
his
best
speed
to
the
batteries
to
overlook
his
people
and
exhort
every
one
to
do
his
duty
in
the
meantime
aramis
with
his
eye
fixed
on
the
horizon
saw
the
ships
continually
drawing
nearer
the
people
and
the
soldiers
perched
on
the
summits
of
the
rocks
could
distinguish
the
masts
then
the
lower
sails
and
at
last
the
hulls
of
the
lighters
bearing
at
the
masthead
the
royal
flag
of
france
it
was
night
when
one
of
these
vessels
which
had
created
such
a
sensation
among
the
inhabitants
of
belleisle
dropped
anchor
within
cannon
shot
of
the
place
it
was
soon
seen
notwithstanding
the
darkness
that
some
sort
of
agitation
reigned
on
board
the
vessel
from
the
side
of
which
a
skiff
was
lowered
of
which
the
three
rowers
bending
to
their
oars
took
the
direction
of
the
port
and
in
a
few
instants
struck
land
at
the
foot
of
the
fort
the
commander
jumped
ashore
he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
which
he
waved
in
the
air
and
seemed
to
wish
to
communicate
with
somebody
this
man
was
soon
recognized
by
several
soldiers
as
one
of
the
pilots
of
the
island
he
was
the
captain
of
one
of
the
two
barks
retained
by
aramis
but
which
porthos
in
his
anxiety
with
regard
to
the
fate
of
the
fishermen
who
had
disappeared
had
sent
in
search
of
the
missing
boats
he
asked
to
be
conducted
to
m
dherblay
two
soldiers
at
a
signal
from
a
sergeant
marched
him
between
them
and
escorted
him
aramis
was
upon
the
quay
the
envoy
presented
himself
before
the
bishop
of
vannes
the
darkness
was
almost
absolute
notwithstanding
the
flambeaux
borne
at
a
small
distance
by
the
soldiers
who
were
following
aramis
in
his
rounds
well
jonathan
from
whom
do
you
come
monseigneur
from
those
who
captured
me
who
captured
you
you
know
monseigneur
we
set
out
in
search
of
our
comrades
yes
and
afterwards
well
monseigneur
within
a
short
league
we
were
captured
by
a
chasse
maree
belonging
to
the
king
ah
said
aramis
of
which
king
cried
porthos
jonathan
started
speak
continued
the
bishop
we
were
captured
monseigneur
and
joined
to
those
who
had
been
taken
yesterday
morning
what
was
the
cause
of
the
mania
for
capturing
you
all
said
porthos
monsieur
to
prevent
us
from
telling
you
replied
jonathan
porthos
was
again
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
and
they
have
released
you
today
asked
he
that
i
might
tell
you
they
have
captured
us
monsieur
trouble
upon
trouble
thought
honest
porthos
during
this
time
aramis
was
reflecting
humph
said
he
then
i
suppose
it
is
a
royal
fleet
blockading
the
coasts
yes
monseigneur
who
commands
it
the
captain
of
the
kings
musketeers
dartagnan
dartagnan
exclaimed
porthos
i
believe
that
is
the
name
and
did
he
give
you
this
letter
yes
monseigneur
bring
the
torches
nearer
it
is
his
writing
said
porthos
aramis
eagerly
read
the
following
lines
order
of
the
king
to
take
belleisle
or
to
put
the
garrison
to
the

if
they
resist

to
make
prisoners
of
all
the
men
of
the

signed
dartagnan
who
the
day
before
yesterday
arrested
m
fouquet
for
the
purpose
of
his
being
sent
to
the
bastile
aramis
turned
pale
and
crushed
the
paper
in
his
hands
what
is
it
asked
porthos
nothing
my
friend
nothing
tell
me
jonathan
monseigneur
did
you
speak
to
m
dartagnan
yes
monseigneur
what
did
he
say
to
you
that
for
ampler
information
he
would
speak
with
monseigneur
where
on

his

and
porthos
repeated
on
board
his
vessel
m
le
mousquetaire
continued
jonathan
told
me
to
take
you
both
on
board
my
canoe
and
bring
you
to
him
let
us
go
at
once
exclaimed
porthos
dear
dartagnan
but
aramis
stopped
him
are
you
mad
cried
he
who
knows
that
it
is
not
a
snare
of
the
other
kings
said
porthos
mysteriously
a
snare
in
fact
thats
what
it
is
my
friend
very
possibly
what
is
to
be
done
then
if
dartagnan
sends
for
us
who
assures
you
that
dartagnan
sends
for
us
well
butbut
his
writing
writing
is
easily
counterfeited
this
looks
counterfeitedunsteady
you
are
always
right
but
in
the
meantime
we
know
nothing
aramis
was
silent
it
is
true
said
the
good
porthos
we
do
not
want
to
know
anything
what
shall
i
do
asked
jonathan
you
will
return
on

this
captains

yes
monseigneur

will
tell
him
that

will
himself
come
into
the
island
ah
i
comprehend
said
porthos
yes
monseigneur
replied
jonathan
but
if
the
captain
should
refuse
to
come
to
belleisle
if
he
refuses
as
we
have
cannon
we
will
make
use
of
them
what
against
dartagnan
if
it
is
dartagnan
porthos
he
will
come

jonathan

and
the

pushed
off
to

very
extraordinary
things
to
tell
you
oh
you
speak
so
well
my
friend
that
i
could
listen
to
you
for
days
together
speak
then
i
begandstop
i
have
an
idea
i
will
to
make
your
task
more
easy
i
will
to
assist
you
in
telling
me
such
things
question
you
i
shall
be
pleased
at
your
doing
so
what
are
we
going
to
fight
for
aramis
if
you
ask
me
many
such
questions
as
thatif
you
would
render
my
task
the
easier
by
interrupting
my
revelations
thus
porthos
you
will
not
help
me
at
all
so
far
on
the
contrary
that
is
the
very
gordian
knot
but
my
friend
with
a
man
like
you
good
generous
and
devoted
the
confession
must
be
bravely
made
i
have
deceived
you
my
worthy
friend
you
have
deceived
me
good
heavens
yes
was
it
for
my
good
aramis
i
thought
so
porthos
i
thought
so
sincerely
my
friend
then
said
the
honest
seigneur
of
bracieux
you
have
rendered
me
a
service
and
i
thank
you
for
it
for
if
you
had
not
deceived
me
i
might
have
deceived
myself
in
what
then
have
you
deceived
me
tell
me
in
that
i
was
serving
the
usurper
against
whom
louis
xiv
at
this
moment
is
directing
his
efforts
the
usurper
said
porthos
scratching
his
head
that
iswell
i
do
not
quite
clearly
comprehend
he
is
one
of
the
two
kings
who
are
contending
for
the
crown
of
france
very
well
then
you
were
serving
him
who
is
not
louis
xiv
you
have
hit
the
matter
in
one
word
it
follows
that
it
follows
that
we
are
rebels
my
poor
friend
the
devil
the
devil
cried
porthos
much
disappointed
oh
but
dear
porthos
be
calm
we
shall
still
find
means
of
getting
out
of
the
affair
trust
me
it
is
not
that
which
makes
me
uneasy
replied
porthos
that
which
alone
touches
me
is
that
ugly
word
rebels
ah
but
and
so
according
to
this
the
duchy
that
was
promised
me
it
was
the
usurper
that
was
to
give
it
to
you
and
that
is
not
the
same
thing
aramis
said
porthos
majestically
my
friend
if
it
had
only
depended
upon
me
you
should
have
become
a
prince
porthos
began
to
bite
his
nails
in
a
melancholy
way
that
is
where
you
have
been
wrong
continued
he
in
deceiving
me
for
that
promised
duchy
i
reckoned
upon
oh
i
reckoned
upon
it
seriously
knowing
you
to
be
a
man
of
your
word
aramis
poor
porthos
pardon
me
i
implore
you
so
then
continued
porthos
without
replying
to
the
bishops
prayer
so
then
it
seems
i
have
quite
fallen
out
with
louis
xiv
oh
i
will
settle
all
that
my
good
friend
i
will
settle
all
that
i
will
take
it
on
myself
alone
aramis
no
no
porthos
i
conjure
you
let
me
act
no
false
generosity
no
inopportune
devotedness
you
knew
nothing
of
my
projects
you
have
done
nothing
of
yourself
with
me
it
is
different
i
alone
am
the
author
of
this
plot
i
stood
in
need
of
my
inseparable
companion
i
called
upon
you
and
you
came
to
me
in
remembrance
of
our
ancient
device
all
for
one
one
for
all
my
crime
is
that
i
was
an
egotist
now
that
is
a
word
i
like
said
porthos
and
seeing
that
you
have
acted
entirely
for
yourself
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
blame
you
it
is
natural
and
upon
this
sublime
reflection
porthos
pressed
his
friends
hand
cordially
in
presence
of
this
ingenuous
greatness
of
soul
aramis
felt
his
own
littleness
it
was
the
second
time
he
had
been
compelled
to
bend
before
real
superiority
of
heart
which
is
more
imposing
than
brilliancy
of
mind
he
replied
by
a
mute
and
energetic
pressure
to
the
endearment
of
his
friend
now
said
porthos
that
we
have
come
to
an
explanation
now
that
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
our
situation
with
respect
to
louis
xiv
i
think
my
friend
it
is
time
to
make
me
comprehend
the
political
intrigue
of
which
we
are
the
victimsfor
i
plainly
see
there
is
a
political
intrigue
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
dartagnan
my
good
porthos
dartagnan
is
coming
and
will
detail
it
to
you
in
all
its
circumstances
but
excuse
me
i
am
deeply
grieved
i
am
bowed
down
with
mental
anguish
and
i
have
need
of
all
my
presence
of
mind
all
my
powers
of
reflection
to
extricate
you
from
the
false
position
in
which
i
have
so
imprudently
involved
you
but
nothing
can
be
more
clear
nothing
more
plain
than
your
position
henceforth
the
king
louis
xiv
has
no
longer
now
but
one
enemy
that
enemy
is
myself
myself
alone
i
have
made
you
a
prisoner
you
have
followed
me
today
i
liberate
you
you
fly
back
to
your
prince
you
can
perceive
porthos
there
is
not
one
difficulty
in
all
this
do
you
think
so
said
porthos
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
then
why
said
the
admirable
good
sense
of
porthos
then
why
if
we
are
in
such
an
easy
position
why
my
friend
do
we
prepare
cannon
muskets
and
engines
of
all
sorts
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
much
more
simple
to
say
to
captain
dartagnan
my
dear
friend
we
have
been
mistaken
that
error
is
to
be
repaired
open
the
door
to
us
let
us
pass
through
and
we
will
say
goodbye
ah
that
said
aramis
shaking
his
head
why
do
you
say
that
do
you
not
approve
of
my
plan
my
friend
i
see
a
difficulty
in
it
what
is
it
the
hypothesis
that
dartagnan
may
come
with
orders
which
will
oblige
us
to
defend
ourselves
what
defend
ourselves
against
dartagnan
folly
against
the
good
dartagnan
aramis
once
more
replied
by
shaking
his
head
porthos
at
length
said
he
if
i
have
had
the
matches
lighted
and
the
guns
pointed
if
i
have
had
the
signal
of
alarm
sounded
if
i
have
called
every
man
to
his
post
upon
the
ramparts
those
good
ramparts
of
belleisle
which
you
have
so
well
fortified
it
was
not
for
nothing
wait
to
judge
or
rather
no
do
not
wait
what
can
i
do
if
i
knew
my
friend
i
would
have
told
you
but
there
is
one
thing
much
more
simple
than
defending
ourselvesa
boat
and
away
for
francewhere
my
dear
friend
said
aramis
smiling
with
a
strong
shade
of
sadness
do
not
let
us
reason
like
children
let
us
be
men
in
council
and
in
executionbut
hark
i
hear
a
hail
for
landing
at
the
port
attention
porthos
serious
attention
it
is
dartagnan
no
doubt
said
porthos
in
a
voice
of
thunder
approaching
the
parapet
yes
it
is
i
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
running
lightly
up
the
steps
of
the
mole
and
gaining
rapidly
the
little
esplanade
on
which
his
two
friends
waited
for
him
as
soon
as
he
came
towards
them
porthos
and
aramis
observed
an
officer
who
followed
dartagnan
treading
apparently
in
his
very
steps
the
captain
stopped
upon
the
stairs
of
the
mole
when
halfway
up
his
companions
imitated
him
make
your
men
draw
back
cried
dartagnan
to
porthos
and
aramis
let
them
retire
out
of
hearing
this
order
given
by
porthos
was
executed
immediately
then
dartagnan
turning
towards
him
who
followed
him
monsieur
said
he
we
are
no
longer
on
board
the
kings
fleet
where
in
virtue
of
your
order
you
spoke
so
arrogantly
to
me
just
now
monsieur
replied
the
officer
i
did
not
speak
arrogantly
to
you
i
simply
but
rigorously
obeyed
instructions
i
was
commanded
to
follow
you
i
follow
you
i
am
directed
not
to
allow
you
to
communicate
with
any
one
without
taking
cognizance
of
what
you
do
i
am
in
duty
bound
accordingly
to
overhear
your
conversations
dartagnan
trembled
with
rage
and
porthos
and
aramis
who
heard
this
dialogue
trembled
likewise
but
with
uneasiness
and
fear
dartagnan
biting
his
mustache
with
that
vivacity
which
denoted
in
him
exasperation
closely
to
be
followed
by
an
explosion
approached
the
officer
monsieur
said
he
in
a
low
voice
so
much
the
more
impressive
that
affecting
calm
it
threatened
tempestmonsieur
when
i
sent
a
canoe
hither
you
wished
to
know
what
i
wrote
to
the
defenders
of
belleisle
you
produced
an
order
to
that
effect
and
in
my
turn
i
instantly
showed
you
the
note
i
had
written
when
the
skipper
of
the
boat
sent
by
me
returned
when
i
received
the
reply
of
these
two
gentlemen
and
he
pointed
to
aramis
and
porthos
you
heard
every
word
of
what
the
messenger
said
all
that
was
plainly
in
your
orders
all
that
was
well
executed
very
punctually
was
it
not
yes
monsieur
stammered
the
officer
yes
without
doubt
but
monsieur
continued
dartagnan
growing
warmmonsieur
when
i
manifested
the
intention
of
quitting
my
vessel
to
cross
to
belleisle
you
demanded
to
accompany
me
i
did
not
hesitate
i
brought
you
with
me
you
are
now
at
belleisle
are
you
not
yes
monsieur
but
butthe
question
no
longer
is
of
m
colbert
who
has
given
you
that
order
or
of
whomsoever
in
the
world
you
are
following
the
instructions
the
question
now
is
of
a
man
who
is
a
clog
upon
m
dartagnan
and
who
is
alone
with
m
dartagnan
upon
steps
whose
feet
are
bathed
by
thirty
feet
of
salt
water
a
bad
position
for
that
man
a
bad
position
monsieur
i
warn
you
but
monsieur
if
i
am
a
restraint
upon
you
said
the
officer
timidly
and
almost
faintly
it
is
my
duty
which
monsieur
you
have
had
the
misfortune
either
you
or
those
that
sent
you
to
insult
me
it
is
done
i
cannot
seek
redress
from
those
who
employ
youthey
are
unknown
to
me
or
are
at
too
great
a
distance
but
you
are
under
my
hand
and
i
swear
that
if
you
make
one
step
behind
me
when
i
raise
my
feet
to
go
up
to
those
gentlemen
i
swear
to
you
by
my
name
i
will
cleave
your
head
in
two
with
my
sword
and
pitch
you
into
the
water
oh
it
will
happen
it
will
happen
i
have
only
been
six
times
angry
in
my
life
monsieur
and
all
five
preceding
times
i
killed
my
man
the
officer
did
not
stir
he
became
pale
under
this
terrible
threat
but
replied
with
simplicity
monsieur
you
are
wrong
in
acting
against
my
orders
porthos
and
aramis
mute
and
trembling
at
the
top
of
the
parapet
cried
to
the
musketeer
good
dartagnan
take
care
dartagnan
made
them
a
sign
to
keep
silence
raised
his
foot
with
ominous
calmness
to
mount
the
stair
and
turned
round
sword
in
hand
to
see
if
the
officer
followed
him
the
officer
made
a
sign
of
the
cross
and
stepped
up
porthos
and
aramis
who
knew
their
dartagnan
uttered
a
cry
and
rushed
down
to
prevent
the
blow
they
thought
they
already
heard
but
dartagnan
passed
his
sword
into
his
left
hand
monsieur
said
he
to
the
officer
in
an
agitated
voice
you
are
a
brave
man
you
will
all
the
better
comprehend
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
now
speak
monsieur
dartagnan
speak
replied
the
officer
these
gentlemen
we
have
just
seen
and
against
whom
you
have
orders
are
my
friends
i
know
they
are
monsieur
you
can
understand
whether
or
not
i
ought
to
act
towards
them
as
your
instructions
prescribe
i
understand
your
reserve
very
well
permit
me
then
to
converse
with
them
without
a
witness
monsieur
dartagnan
if
i
yield
to
your
request
if
i
do
that
which
you
beg
me
i
break
my
word
but
if
i
do
not
do
it
i
disoblige
you
i
prefer
the
one
dilemma
to
the
other
converse
with
your
friends
and
do
not
despise
me
monsieur
for
doing
this
for
your
sake
whom
i
esteem
and
honor
do
not
despise
me
for
committing
for
you
and
you
alone
an
unworthy
act
dartagnan
much
agitated
threw
his
arm
round
the
neck
of
the
young
man
and
then
went
up
to
his
friends
the
officer
enveloped
in
his
cloak
sat
down
on
the
damp
weedcovered
steps
well
said
dartagnan
to
his
friends
such
is
my
position
judge
for
yourselves
all
three
embraced
as
in
the
glorious
days
of
their
youth
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
these
preparations
said
porthos
you
ought
to
have
a
suspicion
of
what
they
signify
said
dartagnan
not
any
i
assure
you
my
dear
captain
for
in
fact
i
have
done
nothing
no
more
has
aramis
the
worthy
baron
hastened
to
say
dartagnan
darted
a
reproachful
look
at
the
prelate
which
penetrated
that
hardened
heart
dear
porthos
cried
the
bishop
of
vannes
you
see
what
is
being
done
against
you
said
dartagnan
interception
of
all
boats
coming
to
or
going
from
belleisle
your
means
of
transport
seized
if
you
had
endeavored
to
fly
you
would
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
cruisers
that
plow
the
sea
in
all
directions
on
the
watch
for
you
the
king
wants
you
to
be
taken
and
he
will
take
you
dartagnan
tore
at
his
gray
mustache
aramis
grew
somber
porthos
angry
my
idea
was
this
continued
dartagnan
to
make
you
both
come
on
board
to
keep
you
near
me
and
restore
you
your
liberty
but
now
who
can
say
when
i
return
to
my
ship
i
may
not
find
a
superior
that
i
may
not
find
secret
orders
which
will
take
from
me
my
command
and
give
it
to
another
who
will
dispose
of
me
and
you
without
hope
of
help
we
must
remain
at
belleisle
said
aramis
resolutely
and
i
assure
you
for
my
part
i
will
not
surrender
easily
porthos
said
nothing
dartagnan
remarked
the
silence
of
his
friend
i
have
another
trial
to
make
of
this
officer
of
this
brave
fellow
who
accompanies
me
and
whose
courageous
resistance
makes
me
very
happy
for
it
denotes
an
honest
man
who
though
an
enemy
is
a
thousand
times
better
than
a
complaisant
coward
let
us
try
to
learn
from
him
what
his
instructions
are
and
what
his
orders
permit
or
forbid
let
us
try
said
aramis
dartagnan
went
to
the
parapet
leaned
over
towards
the
steps
of
the
mole
and
called
the
officer
who
immediately
came
up
monsieur
said
dartagnan
after
having
exchanged
the
cordial
courtesies
natural
between
gentlemen
who
know
and
appreciate
each
other
monsieur
if
i
wished
to
take
away
these
gentlemen
from
here
what
would
you
do
i
should
not
oppose
it
monsieur
but
having
direct
explicit
orders
to
put
them
under
guard
i
should
detain
them
ah
said
dartagnan
thats
all
over
said
aramis
gloomily
porthos
did
not
stir
but
still
take
porthos
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
he
can
prove
to
the
king
and
i
will
help
him
do
so
and
you
too
monsieur
dartagnan
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
hum
said
dartagnan
will
you
come
will
you
follow
me
porthos
the
king
is
merciful
i
want
time
for
reflection
said
porthos
you
will
remain
here
then
until
fresh
orders
said
aramis
with
vivacity
until
we
have
an
idea
resumed
dartagnan
and
i
now
believe
that
will
not
be
long
for
i
have
one
already
let
us
say
adieu
then
said
aramis
but
in
truth
my
good
porthos
you
ought
to
go
no
said
the
latter
laconically
as
you
please
replied
aramis
a
little
wounded
in
his
susceptibilities
at
the
morose
tone
of
his
companion
only
i
am
reassured
by
the
promise
of
an
idea
from
dartagnan
an
idea
i
fancy
i
have
divined
let
us
see
said
the
musketeer
placing
his
ear
near
aramiss
mouth
the
latter
spoke
several
words
rapidly
to
which
dartagnan
replied
that
is
it
precisely
infallible
cried
aramis
during
the
first
emotion
this
resolution
will
cause
take
care
of
yourself
aramis
oh
dont
be
afraid
now
monsieur
said
dartagnan
to
the
officer
thanks
a
thousand
thanks
you
have
made
yourself
three
friends
for
life
yes
added
aramis
porthos
alone
said
nothing
but
merely
bowed
dartagnan
having
tenderly
embraced
his
two
old
friends
left
belleisle
with
the
inseparable
companion
with
whom
m
colbert
had
saddled
him
thus
with
the
exception
of
the
explanation
with
which
the
worthy
porthos
had
been
willing
to
be
satisfied
nothing
had
changed
in
appearance
in
the
fate
of
one
or
the
other
only
said
aramis
there
is
dartagnans
idea
dartagnan
did
not
return
on
board
without
profoundly
analyzing
the
idea
he
had
discovered
now
we
know
that
whatever
dartagnan
did
examine
according
to
custom
daylight
was
certain
to
illuminate
as
to
the
officer
now
grown
mute
again
he
had
full
time
for
meditation
therefore
on
putting
his
foot
on
board
his
vessel
moored
within
cannonshot
of
the
island
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
had
already
got
together
all
his
means
offensive
and
defensive
he
immediately
assembled
his
council
which
consisted
of
the
officers
serving
under
his
orders
these
were
eight
in
number
a
chief
of
the
maritime
forces
a
major
directing
the
artillery
an
engineer
the
officer
we
are
acquainted
with
and
four
lieutenants
having
assembled
them
dartagnan
arose
took
of
his
hat
and
addressed
them
thus
gentlemen
i
have
been
to
reconnoiter
belleileenmer
and
i
have
found
in
it
a
good
and
solid
garrison
moreover
preparations
are
made
for
a
defense
that
may
prove
troublesome
i
therefore
intend
to
send
for
two
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
place
that
we
may
converse
with
them
having
separated
them
from
their
troops
and
cannon
we
shall
be
better
able
to
deal
with
them
particularly
by
reasoning
with
them
is
not
this
your
opinion
gentlemen
the
major
of
artillery
rose
monsieur
said
he
with
respect
but
firmness
i
have
heard
you
say
that
the
place
is
preparing
to
make
a
troublesome
defense
the
place
is
then
as
you
know
determined
on
rebellion
dartagnan
was
visibly
put
out
by
this
reply
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
allow
himself
to
be
subdued
by
a
trifle
and
resumed
monsieur
said
he
your
reply
is
just
but
you
are
ignorant
that
belleisle
is
a
fief
of
m
fouquets
and
that
former
monarchs
gave
the
right
to
the
seigneurs
of
belleisle
to
arm
their
people
the
major
made
a
movement
oh
do
not
interrupt
me
continued
dartagnan
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
that
right
to
arm
themselves
against
the
english
was
not
a
right
to
arm
themselves
against
their
king
but
it
is
not
m
fouquet
i
suppose
who
holds
belleisle
at
this
moment
since
i
arrested
m
fouquet
the
day
before
yesterday
now
the
inhabitants
and
defenders
of
belleisle
know
nothing
of
this
arrest
you
would
announce
it
to
them
in
vain
it
is
a
thing
so
unheardof
and
extraordinary
so
unexpected
that
they
would
not
believe
you
a
breton
serves
his
master
and
not
his
masters
he
serves
his
master
till
he
has
seen
him
dead
now
the
bretons
as
far
as
i
know
have
not
seen
the
body
of
m
fouquet
it
is
not
then
surprising
they
hold
out
against
that
which
is
neither
m
fouquet
nor
his
signature
the
major
bowed
in
token
of
assent
that
is
why
continued
dartagnan
i
propose
to
cause
two
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
garrison
to
come
on
board
my
vessel
they
will
see
you
gentlemen
they
will
see
the
forces
we
have
at
our
disposal
they
will
consequently
know
to
what
they
have
to
trust
and
the
fate
that
attends
them
in
case
of
rebellion
we
will
affirm
to
them
upon
our
honor
that
m
fouquet
is
a
prisoner
and
that
all
resistance
can
only
be
prejudicial
to
them
we
will
tell
them
that
at
the
first
cannon
fired
there
will
be
no
further
hope
of
mercy
from
the
king
then
or
so
at
least
i
trust
they
will
resist
no
longer
they
will
yield
up
without
fighting
and
we
shall
have
a
place
given
up
to
us
in
a
friendly
way
which
it
might
cost
prodigious
efforts
to
subdue
the
officer
who
had
followed
dartagnan
to
belleisle
was
preparing
to
speak
but
dartagnan
interrupted
him
yes
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
tell
me
monsieur
i
know
that
there
is
an
order
of
the
kings
to
prevent
all
secret
communications
with
the
defenders
of
belleisle
and
that
is
exactly
why
i
do
not
offer
to
communicate
except
in
presence
of
my
staff
and
dartagnan
made
an
inclination
of
the
head
to
his
officers
who
knew
him
well
enough
to
attach
a
certain
value
to
the
condescension
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
as
if
to
read
each
others
opinions
in
their
eyes
with
the
intention
of
evidently
acting
should
they
agree
according
to
the
desire
of
dartagnan
and
already
the
latter
saw
with
joy
that
the
result
of
their
consent
would
be
sending
a
bark
to
porthos
and
aramis
when
the
kings
officer
drew
from
a
pocket
a
folded
paper
which
he
placed
in
the
hands
of
dartagnan
this
paper
bore
upon
its
superscription
the
number
1
what
more
murmured
the
surprised
captain
read
monsieur
said
the
officer
with
a
courtesy
that
was
not
free
from
sadness
dartagnan
full
of
mistrust
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
these
words
prohibition
to
m
dartagnan
to
assemble
any
council
whatever
or
to
deliberate
in
any
way
before
belleisle
be
surrendered
and
the
prisoners
shot
signedlouis
dartagnan
repressed
the
quiver
of
impatience
that
ran
through
his
whole
body
and
with
a
gracious
smile
that
is
well
monsieur
said
he
the
kings
orders
shall
be
complied
with
chapter
xliv
result
of
the
ideas
of
the
king
and
the
ideas
of
dartagnan
the
blow
was
direct
it
was
severe
mortal
dartagnan
furious
at
having
been
anticipated
by
an
idea
of
the
kings
did
not
despair
however
even
yet
and
reflecting
upon
the
idea
he
had
brought
back
from
belleisle
he
elicited
therefrom
novel
means
of
safety
for
his
friends
gentlemen
said
he
suddenly
since
the
king
has
charged
some
other
than
myself
with
his
secret
orders
it
must
be
because
i
no
longer
possess
his
confidence
and
i
should
really
be
unworthy
of
it
if
i
had
the
courage
to
hold
a
command
subject
to
so
many
injurious
suspicions
therefore
i
will
go
immediately
and
carry
my
resignation
to
the
king
i
tender
it
before
you
all
enjoining
you
all
to
fall
back
with
me
upon
the
coast
of
france
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
compromise
the
safety
of
the
forces
his
majesty
has
confided
to
me
for
this
purpose
return
all
to
your
posts
within
an
hour
we
shall
have
the
ebb
of
the
tide
to
your
posts
gentlemen
i
suppose
added
he
on
seeing
that
all
prepared
to
obey
him
except
the
surveillant
officer
you
have
no
orders
to
object
this
time
and
dartagnan
almost
triumphed
while
speaking
these
words
this
plan
would
prove
the
safety
of
his
friends
the
blockade
once
raised
they
might
embark
immediately
and
set
sail
for
england
or
spain
without
fear
of
being
molested
whilst
they
were
making
their
escape
dartagnan
would
return
to
the
king
would
justify
his
return
by
the
indignation
which
the
mistrust
of
colbert
had
raised
in
him
he
would
be
sent
back
with
full
powers
and
he
would
take
belleisle
that
is
to
say
the
cage
after
the
birds
had
flown
but
to
this
plan
the
officer
opposed
a
further
order
of
the
kings
it
was
thus
conceived
from
the
moment
m
dartagnan
shall
have
manifested
the
desire
of
giving
in
his
resignation
he
shall
no
longer
be
reckoned
leader
of
the
expedition
and
every
officer
placed
under
his
orders
shall
be
held
to
no
longer
obey
him
moreover
the
said
monsieur
dartagnan
having
lost
that
quality
of
leader
of
the
army
sent
against
belleisle
shall
set
out
immediately
for
france
accompanied
by
the
officer
who
will
have
remitted
the
message
to
him
and
who
will
consider
him
a
prisoner
for
whom
he
is
answerable
brave
and
careless
as
he
was
dartagnan
turned
pale
everything
had
been
calculated
with
a
depth
of
precognition
which
for
the
first
time
in
thirty
years
recalled
to
him
the
solid
foresight
and
inflexible
logic
of
the
great
cardinal
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
thoughtful
scarcely
breathing
if
i
were
to
put
this
order
in
my
pocket
thought
he
who
would
know
it
what
would
prevent
my
doing
it
before
the
king
had
had
time
to
be
informed
i
should
have
saved
those
poor
fellows
yonder
let
us
exercise
some
small
audacity
my
head
is
not
one
of
those
the
executioner
strikes
off
for
disobedience
we
will
disobey
but
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
adopt
this
plan
he
saw
the
officers
around
him
reading
similar
orders
which
the
passive
agent
of
the
thoughts
of
that
infernal
colbert
had
distributed
to
them
this
contingency
of
his
disobedience
had
been
foreseenas
all
the
rest
had
been
monsieur
said
the
officer
coming
up
to
him
i
await
your
good
pleasure
to
depart
i
am
ready
monsieur
replied
dartagnan
grinding
his
teeth
the
officer
immediately
ordered
a
canoe
to
receive
m
dartagnan
and
himself
at
sight
of
this
he
became
almost
distraught
with
rage
how
stammered
he
will
you
carry
on
the
directions
of
the
different
corps
when
you
are
gone
monsieur
replied
the
commander
of
the
fleet
it
is
to
me
the
command
of
the
whole
is
committed
then
monsieur
rejoined
colberts
man
addressing
the
new
leader
it
is
for
you
that
this
last
order
remitted
to
me
is
intended
let
us
see
your
powers
here
they
are
said
the
officer
exhibiting
the
royal
signature
here
are
your
instructions
replied
the
officer
placing
the
folded
paper
in
his
hands
and
turning
round
towards
dartagnan
come
monsieur
said
he
in
an
agitated
voice
such
despair
did
he
behold
in
that
man
of
iron
do
me
the
favor
to
depart
at
once
immediately
articulated
dartagnan
feebly
subdued
crushed
by
implacable
impossibility
and
he
painfully
subsided
into
the
little
boat
which
started
favored
by
wind
and
tide
for
the
coast
of
france
the
kings
guards
embarked
with
him
the
musketeer
still
preserved
the
hope
of
reaching
nantes
quickly
and
of
pleading
the
cause
of
his
friends
eloquently
enough
to
incline
the
king
to
mercy
the
bark
flew
like
a
swallow
dartagnan
distinctly
saw
the
land
of
france
profiled
in
black
against
the
white
clouds
of
night
ah
monsieur
said
he
in
a
low
voice
to
the
officer
to
whom
for
an
hour
he
had
ceased
speaking
what
would
i
give
to
know
the
instructions
for
the
new
commander
they
are
all
pacific
are
they
not
and
he
did
not
finish
the
thunder
of
a
distant
cannon
rolled
athwart
the
waves
another
and
two
or
three
still
louder
dartagnan
shuddered
they
have
commenced
the
siege
of
belleisle
replied
the
officer
the
canoe
had
just
touched
the
soil
of
france
chapter
xlv
the
ancestors
of
porthos
when
dartagnan
left
aramis
and
porthos
the
latter
returned
to
the
principal
fort
in
order
to
converse
with
greater
liberty
porthos
still
thoughtful
was
a
restraint
on
aramis
whose
mind
had
never
felt
itself
more
free
dear
porthos
said
he
suddenly
i
will
explain
dartagnans
idea
to
you
what
idea
aramis
an
idea
to
which
we
shall
owe
our
liberty
within
twelve
hours
ah
indeed
said
porthos
much
astonished
let
us
hear
it
did
you
remark
in
the
scene
our
friend
had
with
the
officer
that
certain
orders
constrained
him
with
regard
to
us
yes
i
did
notice
that
well
dartagnan
is
going
to
give
in
his
resignation
to
the
king
and
during
the
confusion
that
will
result
from
his
absence
we
will
get
away
or
rather
you
will
get
away
porthos
if
there
is
possibility
of
flight
for
only
one
here
porthos
shook
his
head
and
replied
we
will
escape
together
aramis
or
we
will
stay
together
thine
is
a
right
a
generous
heart
said
aramis
only
your
melancholy
uneasiness
affects
me
i
am
not
uneasy
said
porthos
then
you
are
angry
with
me
i
am
not
angry
with
you
then
why
my
friend
do
you
put
on
such
a
dismal
countenance
i
will
tell
you
i
am
making
my
will
and
while
saying
these
words
the
good
porthos
looked
sadly
in
the
face
of
aramis
your
will
cried
the
bishop
what
then
do
you
think
yourself
lost
i
feel
fatigued
it
is
the
first
time
and
there
is
a
custom
in
our
family
what
is
it
my
friend
my
grandfather
was
a
man
twice
as
strong
as
i
am
indeed
said
aramis
then
your
grandfather
must
have
been
samson
himself
no
his
name
was
antoine
well
he
was
about
my
age
when
setting
out
one
day
for
the
chase
he
felt
his
legs
weak
the
man
who
had
never
known
what
weakness
was
before
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
fatigue
my
friend
nothing
good
as
you
will
see
for
having
set
out
complaining
still
of
weakness
of
the
legs
he
met
a
wild
boar
which
made
head
against
him
he
missed
him
with
his
arquebuse
and
was
ripped
up
by
the
beast
and
died
immediately
there
is
no
reason
in
that
why
you
should
alarm
yourself
dear
porthos
oh
you
will
see
my
father
was
as
strong
again
as
i
am
he
was
a
rough
soldier
under
henry
iii
and
henry
iv
his
name
was
not
antoine
but
gaspard
the
same
as
m
de
coligny
always
on
horseback
he
had
never
known
what
lassitude
was
one
evening
as
he
rose
from
table
his
legs
failed
him
he
had
supped
heartily
perhaps
said
aramis
and
that
was
why
he
staggered
bah
a
friend
of
m
de
bassompierre
nonsense
no
no
he
was
astonished
at
this
lassitude
and
said
to
my
mother
who
laughed
at
him
would
not
one
believe
i
was
going
to
meet
with
a
wild
boar
as
the
late
m
du
vallon
my
father
did
well
said
aramis
well
having
this
weakness
my
father
insisted
upon
going
down
into
the
garden
instead
of
going
to
bed
his
foot
slipped
on
the
first
stair
the
staircase
was
steep
my
father
fell
against
a
stone
in
which
an
iron
hinge
was
fixed
the
hinge
gashed
his
temple
and
he
was
stretched
out
dead
upon
the
spot
aramis
raised
his
eyes
to
his
friend
these
are
two
extraordinary
circumstances
said
he
let
us
not
infer
that
there
may
succeed
a
third
it
is
not
becoming
in
a
man
of
your
strength
to
be
superstitious
my
brave
porthos
besides
when
were
your
legs
known
to
fail
never
have
you
stood
so
firm
so
haughtily
why
you
could
carry
a
house
on
your
shoulders
at
this
moment
said
porthos
i
feel
myself
pretty
active
but
at
times
i
vacillate
i
sink
and
lately
this
phenomenon
as
you
say
has
occurred
four
times
i
will
not
say
this
frightens
me
but
it
annoys
me
life
is
an
agreeable
thing
i
have
money
i
have
fine
estates
i
have
horses
that
i
love
i
have
also
friends
that
i
love
dartagnan
athos
raoul
and
you
the
admirable
porthos
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
dissimulate
in
the
very
presence
of
aramis
the
rank
he
gave
him
in
his
friendship
aramis
pressed
his
hand
we
will
still
live
many
years
said
he
to
preserve
to
the
world
such
specimens
of
its
rarest
men
trust
yourself
to
me
my
friend
we
have
no
reply
from
dartagnan
that
is
a
good
sign
he
must
have
given
orders
to
get
the
vessels
together
and
clear
the
seas
on
my
part
i
have
just
issued
directions
that
a
bark
should
be
rolled
on
rollers
to
the
mouth
of
the
great
cavern
of
locmaria
which
you
know
where
we
have
so
often
lain
in
wait
for
the
foxes
yes
and
which
terminates
at
the
little
creek
by
a
trench
where
we
discovered
the
day
that
splendid
fox
escaped
that
way
precisely
in
case
of
misfortunes
a
bark
is
to
be
concealed
for
us
in
that
cavern
indeed
it
must
be
there
by
this
time
we
will
wait
for
a
favorable
moment
and
during
the
night
we
will
go
to
sea
that
is
a
grand
idea
what
shall
we
gain
by
it
we
shall
gain
thisnobody
knows
that
grotto
or
rather
its
issue
except
ourselves
and
two
or
three
hunters
of
the
island
we
shall
gain
thisthat
if
the
island
is
occupied
the
scouts
seeing
no
bark
upon
the
shore
will
never
imagine
we
can
escape
and
will
cease
to
watch
i
understand
well
that
weakness
in
the
legs
oh
better
much
just
now
you
see
then
plainly
that
everything
conspires
to
give
us
quietude
and
hope
dartagnan
will
sweep
the
sea
and
leave
us
free
no
royal
fleet
or
descent
to
be
dreaded
vive
dieu
porthos
we
have
still
half
a
century
of
magnificent
adventure
before
us
and
if
i
once
touch
spanish
ground
i
swear
to
you
added
the
bishop
with
terrible
energy
that
your
brevet
of
duke
is
not
such
a
chance
as
it
is
said
to
be
we
live
by
hope
said
porthos
enlivened
by
the
warmth
of
his
companion
all
at
once
a
cry
resounded
in
their
ears
to
arms
to
arms
this
cry
repeated
by
a
hundred
throats
piercing
the
chamber
where
the
two
friends
were
conversing
carried
surprise
to
one
and
uneasiness
to
the
other
aramis
opened
the
window
he
saw
a
crowd
of
people
running
with
flambeaux
women
were
seeking
places
of
safety
the
armed
population
were
hastening
to
their
posts
the
fleet
the
fleet
cried
a
soldier
who
recognized
aramis
the
fleet
repeated
the
latter
within
half
cannonshot
continued
the
soldier
to
arms
cried
aramis
to
arms
repeated
porthos
formidably
and
both
rushed
forth
towards
the
mole
to
place
themselves
within
the
shelter
of
the
batteries
boats
laden
with
soldiers
were
seen
approaching
and
in
three
directions
for
the
purpose
of
landing
at
three
points
at
once
what
must
be
done
said
an
officer
of
the
guard
stop
them
and
if
they
persist
fire
said
aramis
five
minutes
later
the
cannonade
commenced
these
were
the
shots
that
dartagnan
had
heard
as
he
landed
in
france
but
the
boats
were
too
near
the
mole
to
allow
the
cannon
to
aim
correctly
they
landed
and
the
combat
commenced
hand
to
hand
whats
the
matter
porthos
said
aramis
to
his
friend
nothing
nothingonly
my
legs
it
is
really
incomprehensiblethey
will
be
better
when
we
charge
in
fact
porthos
and
aramis
did
charge
with
such
vigor
and
so
thoroughly
animated
their
men
that
the
royalists
reembarked
precipitately
without
gaining
anything
but
the
wounds
they
carried
away
eh
but
porthos
cried
aramis
we
must
have
a
prisoner
quick
quick
porthos
bent
over
the
stair
of
the
mole
and
seized
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
one
of
the
officers
of
the
royal
army
who
was
waiting
to
embark
till
all
his
people
should
be
in
the
boat
the
arm
of
the
giant
lifted
up
his
prey
which
served
him
as
a
buckler
and
he
recovered
himself
without
a
shot
being
fired
at
him
here
is
a
prisoner
for
you
said
porthos
coolly
to
aramis
well
cried
the
latter
laughing
did
you
not
calumniate
your
legs
it
was
not
with
my
legs
i
captured
him
said
porthos
it
was
with
my
arms
chapter
xlvi
the
son
of
biscarrat
the
bretons
of
the
isle
were
very
proud
of
this
victory
aramis
did
not
encourage
them
in
the
feeling
what
will
happen
said
he
to
porthos
when
everybody
was
gone
home
will
be
that
the
anger
of
the
king
will
be
roused
by
the
account
of
the
resistance
and
that
these
brave
people
will
be
decimated
or
shot
when
they
are
taken
which
cannot
fail
to
take
place
from
which
it
results
then
said
porthos
that
what
we
have
done
is
of
not
the
slightest
use
for
the
moment
it
may
be
replied
the
bishop
for
we
have
a
prisoner
from
whom
we
shall
learn
what
our
enemies
are
preparing
to
do
yes
let
us
interrogate
the
prisoner
said
porthos
and
the
means
of
making
him
speak
are
very
simple
we
are
going
to
supper
we
will
invite
him
to
join
us
as
he
drinks
he
will
talk
this
was
done
the
officer
was
at
first
rather
uneasy
but
became
reassured
on
seeing
what
sort
of
men
he
had
to
deal
with
he
gave
without
having
any
fear
of
compromising
himself
all
the
details
imaginable
of
the
resignation
and
departure
of
dartagnan
he
explained
how
after
that
departure
the
new
leader
of
the
expedition
had
ordered
a
surprise
upon
belleisle
there
his
explanations
stopped
aramis
and
porthos
exchanged
a
glance
that
evinced
their
despair
no
more
dependence
to
be
placed
now
on
dartagnans
fertile
imaginationno
further
resource
in
the
event
of
defeat
aramis
continuing
his
interrogations
asked
the
prisoner
what
the
leaders
of
the
expedition
contemplated
doing
with
the
leaders
of
belleisle
the
orders
are
replied
he
to
kill
during
combat
or
hang
afterwards
porthos
and
aramis
looked
at
each
other
again
and
the
color
mounted
to
their
faces
i
am
too
light
for
the
gallows
replied
aramis
people
like
me
are
not
hung
and
i
am
too
heavy
said
porthos
people
like
me
break
the
cord
i
am
sure
said
the
prisoner
gallantly
that
we
could
have
guaranteed
you
the
exact
kind
of
death
you
preferred
a
thousand
thanks
said
aramis
seriously
porthos
bowed
one
more
cup
of
wine
to
your
health
said
he
drinking
himself
from
one
subject
to
another
the
chat
with
the
officer
was
prolonged
he
was
an
intelligent
gentleman
and
suffered
himself
to
be
led
on
by
the
charm
of
aramiss
wit
and
porthoss
cordial
bonhomie
pardon
me
said
he
if
i
address
a
question
to
you
but
men
who
are
in
their
sixth
bottle
have
a
clear
right
to
forget
themselves
a
little
address

porthos

yes
monsieur
and
amongst
the
best
of
them
if
you
please
said
porthos
that
is
true
i
should
say
even
the
best
of
all
soldiers
messieurs
if
i
did
not
fear
to
offend
the
memory
of
my

of
your

cried
aramis
do
you
know
what
my
name

no
monsieur
but
you
can
tell
us
and
i
am
called
georges
de
biscarrat
oh
cried
porthos
in
his
turn
biscarrat
do
you
remember
that
name
aramis
biscarrat
reflected
the
bishop
it
seems
to
me
try
to
recollect
monsieur
said
the
officer
pardieu
that
wont
take
me
long
said
porthos
biscarratcalled
cardinalone
of
the
four
who
interrupted
us
on
the
day
on
which
we
formed
our
friendship
with
dartagnan
sword
in
hand
precisely
gentlemen
the
only
one
cried
aramis
eagerly
we
could
not
scratch
consequently
a
capital
blade
said
the
prisoner
thats
true
most
true
exclaimed
both
friends
together
ma
foi
monsieur
biscarrat
we
are
delighted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
brave
mans
son
biscarrat
pressed
the
hands
held
out
by
the
two
musketeers
aramis
looked
at
porthos
as
much
as
to
say
here
is
a
man
who
will
help
us
and
without
delayconfess
monsieur
said
he
that
it
is
good
to
have
once
been
a
good
man
my
father
always
said
so
monsieur
confess
likewise
that
it
is
a
sad
circumstance
in
which
you
find
yourself
of
falling
in
with
men
destined
to
be
shot
or
hung
and
to
learn
that
these
men
are
old
acquaintances
in
fact
hereditary
friends
oh
you
are
not
reserved
for
such
a
frightful
fate
as
that
messieurs
and
friends
said
the
young
man
warmly
bah
you
said
so
yourself
i
said
so
just
now
when
i
did
not
know
you
but
now
that
i
know
you
i
sayyou
will
evade
this
dismal
fate
if
you
wish
howif
we
wish
echoed
aramis
whose
eyes
beamed
with
intelligence
as
he
looked
alternately
at
the
prisoner
and
porthos
provided
continued
porthos
looking
in
his
turn
with
noble
intrepidity
at
m
biscarrat
and
the
bishopprovided
nothing
disgraceful
be
required
of
us
nothing
at
all
will
be
required
of
you
gentlemen
replied
the
officerwhat
should
they
ask
of
you
if
they
find
you
they
will
kill
you
that
is
a
predetermined
thing
try
then
gentlemen
to
prevent
their
finding
you
i
dont
think
i
am
mistaken
said
porthos
with
dignity
but
it
appears
evident
to
me
that
if
they
want
to
find
us
they
must
come
and
seek
us
here
in
that
you
are
perfectly
right
my
worthy
friend
replied
aramis
constantly
consulting
with
his
looks
the
countenance
of
biscarrat
who
had
grown
silent
and
constrained
you
wish
monsieur
de
biscarrat
to
say
something
to
us
to
make
us
some
overture
and
you
dare
notis
that
true
ah
gentlemen
and
friends
it
is
because
by
speaking
i
betray
the
watchword
but
hark
i
hear
a
voice
that
frees
mine
by
dominating
it
cannon
said
porthos
cannon
and
musketry
too
cried
the
bishop
on
hearing
at
a
distance
among
the
rocks
these
sinister
reports
of
a
combat
which
they
thought
had
ceased
what
can
that
be
asked
porthos
eh
pardieu
cried
aramis
that
is
just
what
i
expected
what
is
that
that
the
attack
made
by
you
was
nothing
but
a
feint
is
not
that
true
monsieur
and
whilst
your
companions
allowed
themselves
to
be
repulsed
you
were
certain
of
effecting
a
landing
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
oh
several
monsieur
we
are
lost
then
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
quietly
lost
that
is
possible
replied
the
seigneur
de
pierrefonds
but
we
are
not
taken
or
hung
and
so
saying
he
rose
from
the
table
went
to
the
wall
and
coolly
took
down
his
sword
and
pistols
which
he
examined
with
the
care
of
an
old
soldier
who
is
preparing
for
battle
and
who
feels
that
life
in
a
great
measure
depends
upon
the
excellence
and
right
conditions
of
his
arms
at
the
report
of
the
cannon
at
the
news
of
the
surprise
which
might
deliver
up
the
island
to
the
royal
troops
the
terrified
crowd
rushed
precipitately
to
the
fort
to
demand
assistance
and
advice
from
their
leaders
aramis
pale
and
downcast
between
two
flambeaux
showed
himself
at
the
window
which
looked
into
the
principal
court
full
of
soldiers
waiting
for
orders
and
bewildered
inhabitants
imploring
succor

thrown
into

a
sustained
yell
of
vengeful
fury
came
floating
up
to
the

the

collected
under

a
prolonged
roar
of
anger
and
terror

soldiers
of

aramis
from
this
time

no

ah
what
have
you
just
been
saying
my

porthos
monsieur
said
biscarrat
to
the
bishop
you
may
save
all
these
inhabitants
but
thus
you
will
neither
save
yourself
nor
your
friend
monsieur
de
biscarrat
said
the
bishop
of
vannes
with
a
singular
accent
of
nobility
and
courtesy
monsieur
de
biscarrat
be
kind
enough
to
resume
your
liberty
i
am
very
willing
to
do
so
monsieur
but
that
would
render
us
a
service
for
when
announcing
to
the
kings
lieutenant
the
submission
of
the
islanders
you
will
perhaps
obtain
some
grace
for
us
on
informing
him
of
the
manner
in
which
that
submission
has
been
effected
grace
replied
porthos
with
flashing
eyes
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
word
aramis
touched
the
elbow
of
his
friend
roughly
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
in
the
days
of
their
youth
when
he
wanted
to
warn
porthos
that
he
had
committed
or
was
about
to
commit
a
blunder
porthos
understood
him
and
was
silent
immediately
i
will
go
messieurs
replied
biscarrat
a
little
surprised
likewise
at
the
word
grace
pronounced
by
the
haughty
musketeer
of
and
to
whom
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
had
related
with
so
much
enthusiasm
the
heroic
exploits
with
which
his
father
had
delighted
him
go
then
monsieur
biscarrat
said
aramis
bowing
to
him
and
at
parting
receive
the
expression
of
our
entire
gratitude
but
you
messieurs
you
whom
i
think
it
an
honor
to
call
my
friends
since
you
have
been
willing
to
accept
that
title
what
will
become
of
you
in
the
meantime
replied
the
officer
very
much
agitated
at
taking
leave
of
the
two
ancient
adversaries
of
his
father
we
will
wait
here
but
mon
dieuthe
order
is
precise
and
formal
i
am

monsieur
de

and
they
no
more
shoot
a
bishop
than
they
hang
a
gentleman
ah
yes
monsieuryes
monseigneur
replied
biscarrat
it
is
true
you
are
right
there
is
still
that
chance
for
you
then
i
will

i
will

of

adieu
then
messieurs
or
rather
to
meet
again
i
hope
the
worthy
officer
jumping
upon
a
horse
given
him
by
aramis
departed
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
of
cannon
which
by
surging
the
crowd
into
the
fort
had
interrupted
the
conversation
of
the
two
friends
with
their
prisoner
aramis
watched
the
departure
and
when
left
alone
with
porthos
well
do

the
grotto
of
locmaria
the
cavern
of
locmaria
was
sufficiently
distant
from
the
mole
to
render
it
necessary
for
our
friends
to
husband
their
strength
in
order
to
reach
it
besides
night
was
advancing
midnight
had
struck
at
the
fort
porthos
and
aramis
were
loaded
with
money
and
arms
they
walked
then
across
the
heath
which
stretched
between
the
mole
and
the
cavern
listening
to
every
noise
in
order
better
to
avoid
an
ambush
from
time
to
time
on
the
road
which
they
had
carefully
left
on
their
left
passed
fugitives
coming
from
the
interior
at
the
news
of
the
landing
of
the
royal
troops
aramis
and
porthos
concealed
behind
some
projecting
mass
of
rock
collected
the
words
that
escaped
from
the
poor
people
who
fled
trembling
carrying
with
them
their
most
valuable
effects
and
tried
whilst
listening
to
their
complaints
to
gather
something
from
them
for
their
own
interest
at
length
after
a
rapid
race
frequently
interrupted
by
prudent
stoppages
they
reached
the
deep
grottoes
in
which
the
prophetic
bishop
of
vannes
had
taken
care
to
have
secreted
a
bark
capable
of
keeping
the
sea
at
this
fine
season
my
good
friend
said
porthos
panting
vigorously
we
have
arrived
it
seems
but
i
thought
you
spoke
of
three

three
servants

they
are
certainly
waiting
for
us
in
the
cavern
and
no
doubt
are
resting
having
accomplished
their
rough
and
difficult
task
aramis
stopped
porthos
who
was
preparing
to
enter
the
cavern
will
you
allow
me
my
friend
said
he
to
the
giant
to
pass
in
first
i
know
the
signal
i
have
given
to
these
men
who
not
hearing
it
would
be
very
likely
to
fire
upon
you
or
slash
away
with
their
knives
in
the
dark
go
on
then
aramis
go
ongo
first
you
impersonate
wisdom
and
foresight
go
ah
there
is
that
fatigue
again
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
it
has
just
seized
me
afresh
aramis
left
porthos
sitting
at
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
and
bowing
his
head
he
penetrated
into
the
interior
of
the
cavern
imitating
the
cry
of
the
owl
a
little
plaintive
cooing
a
scarcely
distinct
echo
replied
from
the
depths
of
the
cave
aramis
pursued
his
way
cautiously
and
soon
was
stopped
by
the
same
kind
of
cry
as
he
had
first
uttered
within
ten
paces
of
him
are
you
there
yves
said
the
bishop
yes
monseigneur
goenne
is
here
likewise
his
son
accompanies
us
that
is
well
are
all
things
ready
yes
monseigneur
go
to
the
entrance
of
the
grottoes
my
good
yves
and
you
will
there
find
the
seigneur
de
pierrefonds
who
is
resting
after
the
fatigue
of
our
journey
and
if
he
should
happen
not
to
be
able
to
walk
lift
him
up
and
bring
him
hither
to
me
the
three
men
obeyed
but
the
recommendation
given
to
his
servants
was
superfluous
porthos
refreshed
had
already
commenced
the
descent
and
his
heavy
step
resounded
amongst
the
cavities
formed
and
supported
by
columns
of
porphyry
and
granite
as
soon
as
the
seigneur
de
bracieux
had
rejoined
the
bishop
the
bretons
lighted
a
lantern
with
which
they
were
furnished
and
porthos
assured
his
friend
that
he
felt
as
strong
again
as
ever
let
us
inspect
the
boat
said
aramis
and
satisfy
ourselves
at
once
what
it
will
hold
do
not
go
too
near
with
the
light
said
the
patron
yves
for
as
you
desired
me
monseigneur
i
have
placed
under
the
bench
of
the
poop
in
the
coffer
you
know
of
the
barrel
of
powder
and
the
musketcharges
that
you
sent
me
from
the
fort
very
well
said
aramis
and
taking
the
lantern
himself
he
examined
minutely
all
parts
of
the
canoe
with
the
precautions
of
a
man
who
is
neither
timid
nor
ignorant
in
the
face
of
danger
the
canoe
was
long
light
drawing
little
water
thin
of
keel
in
short
one
of
those
that
have
always
been
so
aptly
built
at
belleisle
a
little
high
in
its
sides
solid
upon
the
water
very
manageable
furnished
with
planks
which
in
uncertain
weather
formed
a
sort
of
deck
over
which
the
waves
might
glide
so
as
to
protect
the
rowers
in
two
wellclosed
coffers
placed
beneath
the
benches
of
the
prow
and
the
poop
aramis
found
bread
biscuit
dried
fruits
a
quarter
of
bacon
a
good
provision
of
water
in
leathern
bottles
the
whole
forming
rations
sufficient
for
people
who
did
not
mean
to
quit
the
coast
and
would
be
able
to
revictual
if
necessity
commanded
the
arms
eight
muskets
and
as
many
horsepistols
were
in
good
condition
and
all
loaded
there
were
additional
oars
in
case
of
accident
and
that
little
sail
called
trinquet
which
assists
the
speed
of
the
canoe
at
the
same
time
the
boatmen
row
and
is
so
useful
when
the
breeze
is
slack
when
aramis
had
seen
to
all
these
things
and
appeared
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
inspection
let
us
consult
porthos
said
he
to
know
if
we
must
endeavor
to
get
the
boat
out
by
the
unknown
extremity
of
the
grotto
following
the
descent
and
the
shade
of
the
cavern
or
whether
it
be
better
in
the
open
air
to
make
it
slide
upon
its
rollers
through
the
bushes
leveling
the
road
of
the
little
beach
which
is
but
twenty
feet
high
and
gives
at
high
tide
three
or
four
fathoms
of
good
water
upon
a
sound
bottom
it
must
be
as
you
please
monseigneur
replied
the
skipper
yves
respectfully
but
i
dont
believe
that
by
the
slope
of
the
cavern
and
in
the
dark
in
which
we
shall
be
obliged
to
maneuver
our
boat
the
road
will
be
so
convenient
as
the
open
air
i
know
the
beach
well
and
can
certify
that
it
is
as
smooth
as
a
grassplot
in
a
garden
the
interior
of
the
grotto
on
the
contrary
is
rough
without
reckoning
monseigneur
that
at
its
extremity
we
shall
come
to
the
trench
which
leads
into
the
sea
and
perhaps
the
canoe
will
not
pass
down
it
i
have
made
my
calculation
said
the
bishop
and
i
am
certain
it
will
pass
so
be
it
i
wish
it
may
monseigneur
continued
yves
but
your
highness
knows
very
well
that
to
make
it
reach
the
extremity
of
the
trench
there
is
an
enormous
stone
to
be
liftedthat
under
which
the
fox
always
passes
and
which
closes
the
trench
like
a
door
it
can
be
raised
said
porthos
that
is
nothing
oh
i
know
that
monseigneur
has
the
strength
of
ten
men
replied
yves
but
that
is
giving
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
think
the
skipper
may
be
right
said
aramis
let
us
try
the
openair
passage
the
more
so
monseigneur
continued
the
fisherman
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
embark
before
day
it
will
require
so
much
labor
and
that
as
soon
as
daylight
appears
a
good
vedette
placed
outside
the
grotto
would
be
necessary
indispensable
even
to
watch
the
maneuvers
of
the
lighters
or
cruisers
that
are
on
the
lookout
for
us
yes
yes
yves
your
reasons
are
good
we
will
go
by
the
beach
and
the
three
robust
bretons
went
to
the
boat
and
were
beginning
to
place
their
rollers
underneath
it
to
put
it
in
motion
when
the
distant
barking
of
dogs
was
heard
proceeding
from
the
interior
of
the
island
aramis
darted
out
of
the
grotto
followed
by
porthos
dawn
just
tinted
with
purple
and
white
the
waves
and
plain
through
the
dim
light
melancholy
firtrees
waved
their
tender
branches
over
the
pebbles
and
long
flights
of
crows
were
skimming
with
their
black
wings
the
shimmering
fields
of
buckwheat
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
would
be
clear
daylight
the
wakened
birds
announced
it
to
all
nature
the
barkings
which
had
been
heard
which
had
stopped
the
three
fishermen
engaged
in
moving
the
boat
and
had
brought
aramis
and
porthos
out
of
the
cavern
now
seemed
to
come
from
a
deep
gorge
within
about
a
league
of
the
grotto
it
is
a
pack
of
hounds
said
porthos
the
dogs
are
on
a
scent
who
can
be
hunting
at
such
a
moment
as
this
said
aramis
and
this
way
particularly
continued
porthos
where
they
might
expect
the
army
of
the
royalists
the
noise
comes
nearer
yes
you
are
right
porthos
the
dogs
are
on
a
scent
but
yves
cried
aramis
come
here
come
here
yves
ran
towards
him
letting
fall
the
cylinder
which
he
was
about
to
place
under
the
boat
when
the
bishops
call
interrupted
him
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
hunt
skipper
said
porthos
eh
monseigneur
i
cannot
understand
it
replied
the
breton
it
is
not
at
such
a
moment
that
the
seigneur
de
locmaria
would
hunt
no
and
yet
the
dogs
unless
they
have
escaped
from
the
kennel
no
said
goenne
they
are
not
the
seigneur
de
locmarias
hounds
in
common
prudence
said
aramis
let
us
go
back
into
the
grotto
the
voices
evidently
draw
nearer
we
shall
soon
know
what
we
have
to
trust
to
they
reentered
but
had
scarcely
proceeded
a
hundred
steps
in
the
darkness
when
a
noise
like
the
hoarse
sigh
of
a
creature
in
distress
resounded
through
the
cavern
and
breathless
rapid
terrified
a
fox
passed
like
a
flash
of
lightning
before
the
fugitives
leaped
over
the
boat
and
disappeared
leaving
behind
its
sour
scent
which
was
perceptible
for
several
seconds
under
the
low
vaults
of
the
cave
the
fox
cried
the
bretons
with
the
glad
surprise
of
born
hunters
accursed
mischance
cried
the
bishop
our
retreat
is
discovered
how
so
said
porthos
are
you
afraid
of
a
fox
eh
my
friend
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
do
you
specify
the
fox
it
is
not
the
fox
alone
pardieu
but
dont
you
know
porthos
that
after
the
foxes
come
hounds
and
after
hounds
men
porthos
hung
his
head
as
though
to
confirm
the
words
of
aramis
they
heard
the
yelping
pack
approach
with
frightful
swiftness
upon
the
trail
six
foxhounds
burst
at
once
upon
the
little
heath
with
mingling
yelps
of
triumph
there
are
the
dogs
plain
enough
said
aramis
posted
on
the
lookout
behind
a
chink
in
the
rocks
now
who
are
the
huntsmen
if
it
is
the
seigneur
de
locmarias
replied
the
sailor
he
will
leave
the
dogs
to
hunt
the
grotto
for
he
knows
them
and
will
not
enter
in
himself
being
quite
sure
that
the
fox
will
come
out
the
other
side
it
is
there
he
will
wait
for
him
it
is
not
the
seigneur
de
locmaria
who
is
hunting
replied
aramis
turning
pale
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
maintain
a
placid
countenance
who
is
it
then
said
porthos
look
porthos
applied
his
eye
to
the
slit
and
saw
at
the
summit
of
a
hillock
a
dozen
horsemen
urging
on
their
horses
in
the
track
of
the
dogs
shouting
taiaut
taiaut
the
guards
said
he
yes
my
friend
the
kings
guards
the
kings
guards
do
you
say
monseigneur
cried
the
bretons
growing
pale
in
turn
with
biscarrat
at
their
head
mounted
upon
my
gray
horse
continued
aramis
the
hounds
at
the
same
moment
rushed
into
the
grotto
like
an
avalanche
and
the
depths
of
the
cavern
were
filled
with
their
deafening
cries
ah
the
devil
said
aramis
resuming
all
his
coolness
at
the
sight
of
this
certain
inevitable
danger
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
we
are
lost
but
we
have
at
least
one
chance
left
if
the
guards
who
follow
their
hounds
happen
to
discover
there
is
an
issue
to
the
grotto
there
is
no
help
for
us
for
on
entering
they
must
see
both
ourselves
and
our
boat
the
dogs
must
not
go
out
of
the
cavern
their
masters
must
not
enter
that
is
clear
said
porthos
you
understand
added
aramis
with
the
rapid
precision
of
command
there
are
six
dogs
that
will
be
forced
to
stop
at
the
great
stone
under
which
the
fox
has
glidedbut
at
the
too
narrow
opening
of
which
they
must
be
themselves
stopped
and
killed
the
bretons
sprang
forward
knife
in
hand
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
lamentable
concert
of
angry
barks
and
mortal
howlsand
then
silence
thats
well
said
aramis
coolly
now
for
the
masters
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
said
porthos
wait
their
arrival
conceal
ourselves
and
kill
them
kill
them
replied
porthos
there
are
sixteen
said
aramis
at
least
at
present
and
well
armed
added
porthos
with
a
smile
of
consolation
it
will
last
about
ten
minutes
said
aramis
to
work
and
with
a
resolute
air
he
took
up
a
musket
and
placed
a
huntingknife
between
his
teeth
yves
goenne
and
his
son
continued
aramis
will
pass
the
muskets
to
us
you
porthos
will
fire
when
they
are
close
we
shall
have
brought
down
at
the
lowest
computation
eight
before
the
others
are
aware
of
anythingthat
is
certain
then
all
there
are
five
of
us
will
dispatch
the

the

in
spite
of
the
sort
of
divination
which
was
the
remarkable
side
of
the
character
of
aramis
the
event
subject
to
the
risks
of
things
over
which
uncertainty
presides
did
not

arrived
first
at
the
opening
of
the
grotto
and
comprehended
that
fox
and
hounds
were
one
and
all
engulfed
in
it
only
struck
by
that
superstitious
terror
which
every
dark
and
subterraneous
way
naturally
impresses
upon
the
mind
of
man
he
stopped
at
the
outside
of
the
grotto
and
waited
till
his
companions
should
have
assembled
round
him
well
asked
the
young
men
coming
up
out
of
breath
and
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
this
inaction
well
i
cannot
hear
the
dogs
they
and
the
fox
must
all
be
lost
in
this
infernal
cavern
they
were
too
close
up
said
one
of
the
guards
to
have
lost
scent
all
at
once
besides
we
should
hear
them
from
one
side
or
another
they
must
as
biscarrat
says
be
in
this
grotto
but
then
said
one
of
the
young
men
why
dont
they
give
tongue
it
is
strange
muttered
another
well
but
said
a
fourth
let
us
go
into
this
grotto
does
it
happen
to
be
forbidden
we
should
enter
it
no
replied
biscarrat
only
as
it
looks
as
dark
as
a
wolfs
mouth
we
might
break
our
necks
in
it
witness
the
dogs
said
a
guard
who
seem
to
have
broken
theirs
what
the
devil
can
have
become
of
them
asked
the
young
men
in
chorus
and
every
master
called
his
dog
by
his
name
whistled
to
him
in
his
favorite
mode
without
a
single
one
replying
to
either
call
or
whistle
it
is
perhaps
an
enchanted
grotto
said
biscarrat
let
us
see
and
jumping
from
his
horse
he
made
a
step
into
the
grotto
stop
stop
i
will
accompany
you
said
one
of
the
guards
on
seeing
biscarrat
disappear
in
the
shades
of
the
caverns
mouth
no
replied
biscarrat
there
must
be
something
extraordinary
in
the
placedont
let
us
risk
ourselves
all
at
once
if
in
ten
minutes
you
do
not
hear
of
me
you
can
come
in
but
not
all
at
once
be
it
so
said
the
young
man
who
besides
did
not
imagine
that
biscarrat
ran
much
risk
in
the
enterprise
we
will
wait
for
you
and
without
dismounting
from
their
horses
they
formed
a
circle
round
the
grotto
biscarrat
entered
then
alone
and
advanced
through
the
darkness
till
he
came
in
contact
with
the
muzzle
of
porthoss
musket
the
resistance
which
his
chest
met
with
astonished
him
he
naturally
raised
his
hand
and
laid
hold
of
the
icy
barrel
at
the
same
instant
yves
lifted
a
knife
against
the
young
man
which
was
about
to
fall
upon
him
with
all
force
of
a
bretons
arm
when
the
iron
wrist
of
porthos
stopped
it
halfway
then
like
low
muttering
thunder
his
voice
growled
in
the
darkness
i
will
not
have
him
killed
biscarrat
found
himself
between
a
protection
and
a
threat
the
one
almost
as
terrible
as
the
other
however
brave
the
young
man
might
be
he
could
not
prevent
a
cry
escaping
him
which
aramis
immediately
suppressed
by
placing
a
handkerchief
over
his
mouth
monsieur
de
biscarrat
said
he
in
a
low
voice
we
mean
you
no
harm
and
you
must
know
that
if
you
have
recognized
us
but
at
the
first
word
the
first
groan
the
first
whisper
we
shall
be
forced
to
kill
you
as
we
have
killed
your
dogs
yes
i
recognize
you
gentlemen
said
the
officer
in
a
low
voice
but
why
are
you
herewhat
are
you
doing
here
unfortunate
men
i
thought
you
were
in
the
fort
and
you
monsieur
you
were
to
obtain
conditions
for
us
i
think
i
did
all
i
was
able
messieurs
but
but
what
but
there
are
positive
orders
to
kill
us
biscarrat
made
no
reply
it
would
have
cost
him
too
much
to
speak
of
the
cord
to
gentlemen
aramis
understood
the
silence
of
the
prisoner
monsieur
biscarrat
said
he
you
would
be
already
dead
if
we
had
not
regard
for
your
youth
and
our
ancient
association
with
your
father
but
you
may
yet
escape
from
the
place
by
swearing
that
you
will
not
tell
your
companions
what
you
have
seen
i
will
not
only
swear
that
i
will
not
speak
of
it
said
biscarrat
but
i
still
further
swear
that
i
will
do
everything
in
the
world
to
prevent
my
companions
from
setting
foot
in
the
grotto
biscarrat
biscarrat
cried
several
voices
from
the
outside
coming
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
cave
reply
said
aramis
here
i
am
cried
biscarrat
now
begone
we
depend
on
your
loyalty
and
he
left
his
hold
of
the
young
man
who
hastily
returned
towards
the
light
biscarrat
biscarrat
cried
the
voices
still
nearer
and
the
shadows
of
several
human
forms
projected
into
the
interior
of
the
grotto
biscarrat
rushed
to
meet
his
friends
in
order
to
stop
them
and
met
them
just
as
they
were
adventuring
into
the
cave
aramis
and
porthos
listened
with
the
intense
attention
of
men
whose
life
depends
upon
a
breath
of
air
oh
oh
exclaimed
one
of
the
guards
as
he
came
to
the
light
how
pale
you
are
pale
cried
another
you
ought
to
say
corpsecolor
i
said
the
young
man
endeavoring
to
collect
his
faculties
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
has
happened
exclaimed
all
the
voices
you
have
not
a
drop
of
blood
in
your
veins
my
poor
friend
said
one
of
them
laughing
messieurs
it
is
serious
said
another
he
is
going
to
faint
does
any
one
of
you
happen
to
have
any
salts
and
they
all
laughed
this
hail
of
jests
fell
round
biscarrats
ears
like
musketballs
in
a
melee
he
recovered
himself
amidst
a
deluge
of
interrogations
what
do
you
suppose
i
have
seen
asked
he
i
was
too
hot
when
i
entered
the
grotto
and
i
have
been
struck
with
a
chill
that
is
all
but
the
dogs
the
dogs
have
you
seen
them
againdid
you
see
anything
of
themdo
you
know
anything
about
them
i
suppose
they
have
got
out
some
other
way
messieurs
said
one
of
the
young
men
there
is
in
that
which
is
going
on
in
the
paleness
and
silence
of
our
friend
a
mystery
which
biscarrat
will
not
or
cannot
reveal
only
and
this
is
certain
biscarrat
has
seen
something
in
the
grotto
well
for
my
part
i
am
very
curious
to
see
what
it
is
even
if
it
is
the
devil
to
the
grotto
messieurs
to
the
grotto
to
the
grotto
repeated
all
the
voices
and
the
echo
of
the
cavern
carried
like
a
menace
to
porthos
and
aramis
to
the
grotto
to
the
grotto
biscarrat
threw
himself
before
his
companions
messieurs
messieurs
cried
he
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
not
go
in
why
what
is
there
so
terrific
in
the
cavern
asked
several
at
once
come
speak
biscarrat
decidedly
it
is
the
devil
he
has
seen
repeated
he
who
had
before
advanced
that
hypothesis
well
said
another
if
he
has
seen
him
he
need
not
be
selfish
he
may
as
well
let
us
have
a
look
at
him
in
turn
messieurs
messieurs
i
beseech
you
urged
biscarrat
nonsense
let
us
pass
messieurs
i
implore
you
not
to
enter
why
you
went
in
yourself
then
one
of
the
officers
whoof
a
riper
age
than
the
othershad
till
this
time
remained
behind
and
had
said
nothing
advanced
messieurs
said
he
with
a
calmness
which
contrasted
with
the
animation
of
the
young
men
there
is
in
there
some
person
or
something
that
is
not
the
devil
but
which
whatever
it
may
be
has
had
sufficient
power
to
silence
our
dogs
we
must
discover
who
this
some
one
is
or
what
this
something
is
biscarrat
made
a
last
effort
to
stop
his
friends
but
it
was
useless
in
vain
he
threw
himself
before
the
rashest
in
vain
he
clung
to
the
rocks
to
bar
the
passage
the
crowd
of
young
men
rushed
into
the
cave
in
the
steps
of
the
officer
who
had
spoken
last
but
who
had
sprung
in
first
sword
in
hand
to
face
the
unknown
danger
biscarrat
repulsed
by
his
friends
unable
to
accompany
them
without
passing
in
the
eyes
of
porthos
and
aramis
for
a
traitor
and
a
perjurer
with
painfully
attentive
ear
and
unconsciously
supplicating
hands
leaned
against
the
rough
side
of
a
rock
which
he
thought
must
be
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
musketeers
as
to
the
guards
they
penetrated
further
and
further
with
exclamations
that
grew
fainter
as
they
advanced
all
at
once
a
discharge
of
musketry
growling
like
thunder
exploded
in
the
entrails
of
the
vault
two
or
three
balls
were
flattened
against
the
rock
on
which
biscarrat
was
leaning
at
the
same
instant
cries
shrieks
imprecations
burst
forth
and
the
little
troop
of
gentlemen
reappearedsome
pale
some
bleedingall
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
which
the
outer
air
seemed
to
suck
from
the
depths
of
the
cavern
biscarrat
biscarrat
cried
the
fugitives
you
knew
there
was
an
ambuscade
in
that
cavern
and
you
did
not
warn
us
biscarrat
you
are
the
cause
that
four
of
us
are
murdered
men
woe
be
to
you
biscarrat
you
are
the
cause
of
my
being
wounded
unto
death
said
one
of
the
young
men
letting
a
gush
of
scarlet
lifeblood
vomit
in
his
palm
and
spattering
it
into
biscarrats
livid
face
my
blood
be
on
your
head
and
he
rolled
in
agony
at
the
feet
of
the
young
man
but
at
least
tell
us
who
is
there
cried
several
furious
voices
biscarrat
remained
silent
tell
us
or
die
cried
the
wounded
man
raising
himself
upon
one
knee
and
lifting
towards
his
companion
an
arm
bearing
a
useless
sword
biscarrat
rushed
towards
him
opening
his
breast
for
the
blow
but
the
wounded
man
fell
back
not
to
rise
again
uttering
a
groan
which
was
his
last
biscarrat
with
hair
on
end
haggard
eyes
and
bewildered
head
advanced
towards
the
interior
of
the
cavern
saying
you
are
right
death
to
me
who
have
allowed
my
comrades
to
be
assassinated
i
am
a
worthless
wretch
and
throwing
away
his
sword
for
he
wished
to
die
without
defending
himself
he
rushed
head
foremost
into
the
cavern
the
others
followed
him
the
eleven
who
remained
out
of
sixteen
imitated
his
example
but
they
did
not
go
further
than
the
first
a
second
discharge
laid
five
upon
the
icy
sand
and
as
it
was
impossible
to
see
whence
this
murderous
thunder
issued
the
others
fell
back
with
a
terror
that
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
but
far
from
flying
as
the
others
had
done
biscarrat
remained
safe
and
sound
seated
on
a
fragment
of
rock
and
waited
there
were
only
six
gentlemen
left
seriously
said
one
of
the
survivors
is
it
the
devil
ma
foi
it
is
much
worse
said
another
ask
biscarrat
he
knows
where
is
biscarrat
the
young
men
looked
round
them
and
saw
that
biscarrat
did
not
answer
he
is
dead
said
two
or
three
voices
oh
no
replied
another
i
saw
him
through
the
smoke
sitting
quietly
on
a
rock
he
is
in
the
cavern
he
is
waiting
for
us
he
must
know
who
are
there
and
how
should
he
know
them
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
rebels
that
is
true
well
let
us
call
him
and
learn
from
him
whom
we
have
to
deal
with
and
all
voices
shouted
biscarrat
biscarrat
but
biscarrat
did
not
answer
good
said
the
officer
who
had
shown
so
much
coolness
in
the
affair
we
have
no
longer
any
need
of
him
here
are
reinforcements
coming
in
fact
a
company
of
guards
left
in
the
rear
by
their
officers
whom
the
ardor
of
the
chase
had
carried
awayfrom
seventyfive
to
eighty
menarrived
in
good
order
led
by
their
captain
and
the
first
lieutenant
the
five
officers
hastened
to
meet
their
soldiers
and
in
language
the
eloquence
of
which
may
be
easily
imagined
they
related
the
adventure
and
asked
for
aid
the
captain
interrupted
them
where
are
your
companions
demanded
he
dead
but
there
were
sixteen
of
you
ten
are
dead
biscarrat
is
in
the
cavern
and
we
are
five

he

in
fact
biscarrat
appeared
at
the
opening
of
the
grotto
he
is
making
a
sign
to
come
on
said
the
officer
come
on
come
on
cried
all
the
troop
and
they
advanced
to
meet
biscarrat
monsieur
said
the
captain
addressing
biscarrat
i
am
assured
that
you
know
who
the
men
are
in
that
grotto
and
who
make
such
a
desperate
defense
in
the
kings
name
i
command
you
to
declare
what
you
know
captain
said
biscarrat
you
have
no
need
to
command
me
my
word
has
been
restored
to
me
this
very
instant
and
i
came
in
the
name
of
these
men
to
tell
me
who
they
are
to
tell
you
they
are
determined
to
defend
themselves
to
the
death
unless
you
grant
them
satisfactory
terms
how
many
are
there
of
them
then
there
are
two
said
biscarrat
there
are
twoand
want
to
impose
conditions
upon
us
there
are
two
and
they
have
already
killed
ten
of
our
men
what
sort
of
people
are
theygiants
worse
than
that
do
you
remember
the
history
of
the
bastion
saintgervais
captain
yes
where
four
musketeers
held
out
against
an
army
well
these
are
two
of
those
same
musketeers
and
their
names
at
that
period
they
were
called
porthos
and
aramis
now
they
are
styled
m
dherblay
and
m
du
vallon
and
what
interest
have
they
in
all
this
it
is
they
who
were
holding
bellisle
for
m
fouquet
a
murmur
ran
through
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
on
hearing
the
two
words
porthos
and
aramis
the
musketeers
the
musketeers
repeated
they
and
among
all
these
brave
men
the
idea
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
struggle
against
two
of
the
oldest
glories
of
the
french
army
made
a
shiver
half
enthusiasm
twothirds
terror
run
through
them
in
fact
those
four
namesdartagnan
athos
porthos
and
aramiswere
venerated
among
all
who
wore
a
sword
as
in
antiquity
the
names
of
hercules
theseus
castor
and
pollux
were
venerated
two
menand
they
have
killed
ten
in
two
discharges
it
is
impossible
monsieur
biscarrat
eh
captain
replied
the
latter
i
do
not
tell
you
that
they
have
not
with
them
two
or
three
men
as
the
musketeers
of
the
bastion
saintgervais
had
two
or
three
lackeys
but
believe
me
captain
i
have
seen
these
men
i
have
been
taken
prisoner
by
themi
know
they
themselves
alone
are
allsufficient
to
destroy
an
army
that
we
shall
see
said
the
captain
and
that
in
a
moment
too
gentlemen
attention
at
this
reply
no
one
stirred
and
all
prepared
to
obey
biscarrat
alone
risked
a
last
attempt
monsieur
said
he
in
a
low
voice
be
persuaded
by
me
let
us
pass
on
our
way
those
two
men
those
two
lions
you
are
going
to
attack
will
defend
themselves
to
the
death
they
have
already
killed
ten
of
our
men
they
will
kill
double
the
number
and
end
by
killing
themselves
rather
than
surrender
what
shall
we
gain
by
fighting
them
we
shall
gain
the
consciousness
monsieur
of
not
having
allowed
eighty
of
the
kings
guards
to
retire
before
two
rebels
if
i
listened
to
your
advice
monsieur
i
should
be
a
dishonored
man
and
by
dishonoring
myself
i
should
dishonor
the
army
forward
my
men
and
he
marched
first
as
far
as
the
opening
of
the
grotto
there
he
halted
the
object
of
this
halt
was
to
give
biscarrat
and
his
companions
time
to
describe
to
him
the
interior
of
the
grotto
then
when
he
believed
he
had
a
sufficient
acquaintance
with
the
place
he
divided
his
company
into
three
bodies
which
were
to
enter
successively
keeping
up
a
sustained
fire
in
all
directions
no
doubt
in
this
attack
they
would
lose
five
more
perhaps
ten
but
certainly
they
must
end
by
taking
the
rebels
since
there
was
no
issue
and
at
any
rate
two
men
could
not
kill
eighty
captain
said
biscarrat
i
beg
to
be
allowed
to
march
at
the
head
of
the
first
platoon
so
be
it
replied
the
captain
you
have
all
the
honor
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
thanks
replied
the
young
man
with
all
the
firmness
of
his
race
take
your
sword
then
i
shall
go
as
i
am
captain
said
biscarrat
for
i
do
not
go
to
kill
i
go
to
be
killed
and

himself
at

chapter
xlix
an
homeric
song
it
is
time
to
pass
to
the
other
camp
and
to
describe
at
once
the
combatants
and
the
field
of
battle
aramis
and
porthos
had
gone
to
the
grotto
of
locmaria
with
the
expectation
of
finding
there
their
canoe
ready
armed
as
well
as
the
three
bretons
their
assistants
and
they
at
first
hoped
to
make
the
bark
pass
through
the
little
issue
of
the
cavern
concealing
in
that
fashion
both
their
labors
and
their
flight
the
arrival
of
the
fox
and
dogs
obliged
them
to
remain
concealed
the
grotto
extended
the
space
of
about
a
hundred
toises
to
that
little
slope
dominating
a
creek
formerly
a
temple
of
the
celtic
divinities
when
belleisle
was
still
called
kalonese
this
grotto
had
beheld
more
than
one
human
sacrifice
accomplished
in
its
mystic
depths
the
first
entrance
to
the
cavern
was
by
a
moderate
descent
above
which
distorted
rocks
formed
a
weird
arcade
the
interior
very
uneven
and
dangerous
from
the
inequalities
of
the
vault
was
subdivided
into
several
compartments
which
communicated
with
each
other
by
means
of
rough
and
jagged
steps
fixed
right
and
left
in
uncouth
natural
pillars
at
the
third
compartment
the
vault
was
so
low
the
passage
so
narrow
that
the
bark
would
scarcely
have
passed
without
touching
the
side
nevertheless
in
moments
of
despair
wood
softens
and
stone
grows
flexible
beneath
the
human
will
such
was
the
thought
of
aramis
when
after
having
fought
the
fight
he
decided
upon
flighta
flight
most
dangerous
since
all
the
assailants
were
not
dead
and
that
admitting
the
possibility
of
putting
the
bark
to
sea
they
would
have
to
fly
in
open
day
before
the
conquered
so
interested
on
recognizing
their
small
number
in
pursuing
their
conquerors
when
the
two
discharges
had
killed
ten
men
aramis
familiar
with
the
windings
of
the
cavern
went
to
reconnoiter
them
one
by
one
and
counted
them
for
the
smoke
prevented
seeing
outside
and
he
immediately
commanded
that
the
canoe
should
be
rolled
as
far
as
the
great
stone
the
closure
of
the
liberating
issue
porthos
collected
all
his
strength
took
the
canoe
in
his
arms
and
raised
it
up
whilst
the
bretons
made
it
run
rapidly
along
the
rollers
they
had
descended
into
the
third
compartment
they
had
arrived
at
the
stone
which
walled
the
outlet
porthos
seized
this
gigantic
stone
at
its
base
applied
his
robust
shoulder
and
gave
a
heave
which
made
the
wall
crack
a
cloud
of
dust
fell
from
the
vault
with
the
ashes
of
ten
thousand
generations
of
sea
birds
whose
nests
stuck
like
cement
to
the
rock
at
the
third
shock
the
stone
gave
way
and
oscillated
for
a
minute
porthos
placing
his
back
against
the
neighboring
rock
made
an
arch
with
his
foot
which
drove
the
block
out
of
the
calcareous
masses
which
served
for
hinges
and
cramps
the
stone
fell
and
daylight
was
visible
brilliant
radiant
flooding
the
cavern
through
the
opening
and
the
blue
sea
appeared
to
the
delighted
bretons
they
began
to
lift
the
bark
over
the
barricade
twenty
more
toises
and
it
would
glide
into
the
ocean
it
was
during
this
time
that
the
company
arrived
was
drawn
up
by
the
captain
and
disposed
for
either
an
escalade
or
an
assault
aramis
watched
over
everything
to
favor
the
labors
of
his
friends
he
saw
the
reinforcements
counted
the
men
and
convinced
himself
at
a
single
glance
of
the
insurmountable
peril
to
which
fresh
combat
would
expose
them
to
escape
by
sea
at
the
moment
the
cavern
was
about
to
be
invaded
was
impossible
in
fact
the
daylight
which
had
just
been
admitted
to
the
last
compartments
had
exposed
to
the
soldiers
the
bark
being
rolled
towards
the
sea
the
two
rebels
within
musketshot
and
one
of
their
discharges
would
riddle
the
boat
if
it
did
not
kill
the
navigators
besides
allowing
everythingif
the
bark
escaped
with
the
men
on
board
of
it
how
could
the
alarm
be
suppressedhow
could
notice
to
the
royal
lighters
be
prevented
what
could
hinder
the
poor
canoe
followed
by
sea
and
watched
from
the
shore
from
succumbing
before
the
end
of
the
day
aramis
digging
his
hands
into
his
gray
hair
with
rage
invoked
the
assistance
of
god
and
the
assistance
of
the
demons
calling
to
porthos
who
was
doing
more
work
than
all
the
rollerswhether
of
flesh
or
woodmy
friend
said
he
our
adversaries
have
just
received
a
reinforcement
ah
ah
said
porthos
quietly
what
is
to
be
done
then
to
recommence
the
combat
said
aramis
is
hazardous
yes
said
porthos
for
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
out
of
two
one
should
not
be
killed
and
certainly
if
one
of
us
was
killed
the
other
would
get
himself
killed
also
porthos
spoke
these
words
with
that
heroic
nature
which
with
him
grew
grander
with
necessity
aramis
felt
it
like
a
spur
to
his
heart
we
shall
neither
of
us
be
killed
if
you
do
what
i
tell
you
friend
porthos
tell
me
what
these
people
are
coming
down
into
the
grotto
yes
we
could
kill
about
fifteen
of
them
but
no
more
how
many
are
there
in
all
asked
porthos
they
have
received
a
reinforcement
of
seventyfive
men
seventyfive
and
five
eighty
ah
sighed
porthos
if
they
fire
all
at
once
they
will
riddle
us
with
balls
certainly
they
will
without
reckoning
added
aramis
that
the
detonation
might
occasion
a
collapse
of
the
cavern
ay
said
porthos
a
piece
of
falling
rock
just
now
grazed
my
shoulder
you
see
then
oh
it
is
nothing
we
must
determine
upon
something
quickly
our
bretons
are
going
to
continue
to
roll
the
canoe
towards
the
sea
very
well
we
two
will
keep
the
powder
the
balls
and
the
muskets
here
but
only
two
my
dear
aramiswe
shall
never
fire
three
shots
together
said
porthos
innocently
the
defense
by
musketry
is
a
bad
one
find
a
better
then
i
have
found
one
said
the
giant
eagerly
i
will
place
myself
in
ambuscade
behind
the
pillar
with
this
iron
bar
and
invisible
unattackable
if
they
come
in
floods
i
can
let
my
bar
fall
upon
their
skulls
thirty
times
in
a
minute
hein
what
do
you
think
of
the
project
you
smile
excellent
dear
friend
perfect
i
approve
it
greatly
only
you
will
frighten
them
and
half
of
them
will
remain
outside
to
take
us
by
famine
what
we
want
my
good
friend
is
the
entire
destruction
of
the
troop
a
single
survivor
encompasses
our
ruin
you
are
right
my
friend
but
how
can
we
attract
them
pray
by
not
stirring
my
good
porthos
well
we
wont
stir
then
but
when
they
are
all
together
then
leave
it
to
me
i
have
an
idea
if
it
is
so
and
your
idea
proves
a
good
oneand
your
idea
is
most
likely
to
be
goodi
am
satisfied
to
your
ambuscade
porthos
and
count
how
many
enter
but
you
what
will
you
do
dont
trouble
yourself
about
me
i
have
a
task
to
perform
i
think
i
hear
shouts
it
is
they
to
your
post
keep
within
reach
of
my
voice
and
hand
porthos
took
refuge
in
the
second
compartment
which
was
in
darkness
absolutely
black
aramis
glided
into
the
third
the
giant
held
in
his
hand
an
iron
bar
of
about
fifty
pounds
weight
porthos
handled
this
lever
which
had
been
used
in
rolling
the
bark
with
marvelous
facility
during
this
time
the
bretons
had
pushed
the
bark
to
the
beach
in
the
further
and
lighter
compartment
aramis
stooping
and
concealed
was
busy
with
some
mysterious
maneuver
a
command
was
given
in
a
loud
voice
it

having
taken
their
ground
began
to
fire
the
echoes
shrieked
and
barked
the
hissing
balls
seemed
actually
to

in

who
animated
by
the
smell

his

the

direct
upon
the

of

was

before
he

ended

the

rose
ten
times
in
ten
seconds
and
made
ten
corpses
the
soldiers
could
see
nothing
they
heard
sighs
and
groans
they
stumbled
over
dead
bodies
but
as
they
had
no
conception
of
the
cause
of
all
this
they
came
forward
jostling

falling

the

without
a

quietly
advancing
only
commanded
by
the
captain
the
men
had
stripped
a
fir
growing
on
the
shore
and
with
its
resinous
branches
twisted
together
the
captain
had
made
a
flambeau
on
arriving
at
the
compartment
where
porthos
like
the
exterminating
angel
had
destroyed
all
he
touched
the
first
rank
drew
back
in
terror
no
firing
had
replied
to
that
of
the
guards
and
yet
their
way
was
stopped
by
a
heap
of
dead
bodiesthey
literally
walked
in
blood
porthos
was
still
behind
his
pillar
the
captain
illumining
with
trembling
pinetorch
this
frightful
carnage
of
which
he
in
vain
sought
the
cause
drew
back
towards
the
pillar
behind
which
porthos
was
concealed
then
a
gigantic
hand
issued
from
the
shade
and
fastened
on
the
throat
of
the
captain
who
uttered
a
stifle
rattle
his
stretchedout
arms
beating
the
air
the
torch
fell
and
was
extinguished
in
blood
a
second
after
the
corpse
of
the
captain
dropped
close
to
the
extinguished
torch
and
added
another
body
to
the
heap
of
dead
which
blocked
up
the
passage
all
this
was
effected
as
mysteriously
as
though
by
magic
at
hearing
the
rattling
in
the
throat
of
the
captain
the
soldiers
who
accompanied
him
had
turned
round
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
extended
arms
his
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
and
then
the
torch
fell
and
they
were
left
in
darkness
from
an
unreflective
instinctive
mechanical
feeling
the
lieutenant
cried
fire
immediately
a
volley
of
musketry
flamed
thundered
roared
in
the
cavern
bringing
down
enormous
fragments
from
the
vaults
the
cavern
was
lighted
for
an
instant
by
this
discharge
and
then
immediately
returned
to
pitchy
darkness
rendered
thicker
by
the
smoke
to
this
succeeded
a
profound
silence
broken
only
by
the
steps
of
the
third
brigade
now
entering
the
cavern
chapter
l
the
death
of
a
titan
at
the
moment
when
porthos
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
than
these
men
coming
from
open
daylight
was
looking
round
him
to
see
if
through
this
artificial
midnight
aramis
were
not
making
him
some
signal
he
felt
his
arm
gently
touched
and
a
voice
low
as
a
breath
murmured
in
his
ear
come
oh
said
porthos
hush
said
aramis
if
possible
yet
more
softly
and
amidst
the
noise
of
the
third
brigade
which
continued
to
advance
the
imprecations
of
the
guards
still
left
alive
the
muffled
groans
of
the
dying
aramis
and
porthos
glided
unseen
along
the
granite
walls
of
the
cavern
aramis
led
porthos
into
the
last
but
one
compartment
and
showed
him
in
a
hollow
of
the
rocky
wall
a
barrel
of
powder
weighing
from
seventy
to
eighty
pounds
to
which
he
had
just
attached
a
fuse
my
friend
said
he
to
porthos
you
will
take
this
barrel
the
match
of
which
i
am
going
to
set
fire
to
and
throw
it
amidst
our
enemies
can
you
do
so
parbleu
replied
porthos
and
he
lifted
the
barrel
with
one
hand
light
it
stop
said
aramis
till
they
are
all
massed
together
and
then
my
jupiter
hurl
your
thunderbolt
among
them
light
it
repeated
porthos
on
my
part
continued
aramis
i
will
join
our
bretons
and
help
them
to
get
the
canoe
to
the
sea
i
will
wait
for
you
on
the
shore
launch
it
strongly
and
hasten
to
us
light
it
said
porthos
a
third
time
but
do
you
understand
me
parbleu
said
porthos
again
with
laughter
that
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
restrain
when
a
thing
is
explained
to
me
i
understand
it
begone
and
give
me
the
light
aramis
gave
the
burning
match
to
porthos
who
held
out
his
arm
to
him
his
hands
being
engaged
aramis
pressed
the
arm
of
porthos
with
both
his
hands
and
fell
back
to
the
outlet
of
the
cavern
where
the
three
rowers
awaited
him
porthos
left
alone
applied
the
spark
bravely
to
the
match
the
sparka
feeble
spark
first
principle
of
conflagrationshone
in
the
darkness
like
a
glowworm
then
was
deadened
against
the
match
which
it
set
fire
to
porthos
enlivening
the
flame
with
his
breath
the
smoke
was
a
little
dispersed
and
by
the
light
of
the
sparkling
match
objects
might
for
two
seconds
be
distinguished
it
was
a
brief
but
splendid
spectacle
that
of
this
giant
pale
bloody
his
countenance
lighted
by
the
fire
of
the
match
burning
in
surrounding
darkness
the
soldiers
saw
him
they
saw
the
barrel
he
held
in
his
handthey
at
once
understood
what
was
going
to
happen
then
these
men
already
choked
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
what
had
been
accomplished
filled
with
terror
at
thought
of
what
was
about
to
be
accomplished
gave
out
a
simultaneous
shriek
of
agony
some
endeavored
to
fly
but
they
encountered
the
third
brigade
which
barred
their
passage
others
mechanically
took
aim
and
attempted
to
fire
their
discharged
muskets
others
fell
instinctively
upon
their
knees
two
or
three
officers
cried
out
to
porthos
to
promise
him
his
liberty
if
he
would
spare
their
lives
the
lieutenant
of
the
third
brigade
commanded
his
men
to
fire
but
the
guards
had
before
them
their
terrified
companions
who
served
as
a
living
rampart
for
porthos
we
have
said
that
the
light
produced
by
the
spark
and
the
match
did
not
last
more
than
two
seconds
but
during
these
two
seconds
this
is
what
it
illumined
in
the
first
place
the
giant
enlarged
in
the
darkness
then
at
ten
paces
off
a
heap
of
bleeding
bodies
crushed
mutilated
in
the
midst
of
which
some
still
heaved
in
the
last
agony
lifting
the
mass
as
a
last
respiration
inflating
the
sides
of
some
old
monster
dying
in
the
night
every
breath
of
porthos
thus
vivifying
the
match
sent
towards
this
heap
of
bodies
a
phosphorescent
aura
mingled
with
streaks
of
purple
in
addition
to
this
principal
group
scattered
about
the
grotto
as
the
chances
of
death
or
surprise
had
stretched
them
isolated
bodies
seemed
to
be
making
ghastly
exhibitions
of
their
gaping
wounds
above
ground
bedded
in
pools
of
blood
rose
heavy
and
sparkling
the
short
thick
pillars
of
the
cavern
of
which
the
strongly
marked
shades
threw
out
the
luminous
particles
and
all
this
was
seen
by
the
tremulous
light
of
a
match
attached
to
a
barrel
of
powder
that
is
to
say
a
torch
which
whilst
throwing
a
light
on
the
dead
past
showed
death
to
come
as
i
have
said
this
spectacle
did
not
last
above
two
seconds
during
this
short
space
of
time
an
officer
of
the
third
brigade
got
together
eight
men
armed
with
muskets
and
through
an
opening
ordered
them
to
fire
upon
porthos
but
they
who
received
the
order
to
fire
trembled
so
that
three
guards
fell
by
the
discharge
and
the
five
remaining
balls
hissed
on
to
splinter
the
vault
plow
the
ground
or
indent
the
pillars
of
the
cavern
a
burst
of
laughter
replied
to
this
volley
then
the
arm
of
the
giant
swung
round
then
was
seen
whirling
through
the
air
like
a
falling
star
the
train
of
fire
the
barrel
hurled
a
distance
of
thirty
feet
cleared
the
barricade
of
dead
bodies
and
fell
amidst
a
group
of
shrieking
soldiers
who
threw
themselves
on
their
faces
the
officer
had
followed
the
brilliant
train
in
the
air
he
endeavored
to
precipitate
himself
upon
the
barrel
and
tear
out
the
match
before
it
reached
the
powder
it
contained
useless
the
air
had
made
the
flame
attached
to
the
conductor
more
active
the
match
which
at
rest
might
have
burnt
five
minutes
was
consumed
in
thirty
seconds
and
the
infernal
work
exploded
furious
vortices
of
sulphur
and
nitre
devouring
shoals
of
fire
which
caught
every
object
the
terrible
thunder
of
the
explosion
this
is
what
the
second
which
followed
disclosed
in
that
cavern
of
horrors
the
rocks
split
like
planks
of
deal
beneath
the
axe
a
jet
of
fire
smoke
and
debris
sprang
from
the
middle
of
the
grotto
enlarging
as
it
mounted
the
large
walls
of
silex
tottered
and
fell
upon
the
sand
and
the
sand
itself
an
instrument
of
pain
when
launched
from
its
hard
bed
riddled
the
faces
with
its
myriad
cutting
atoms
shrieks
imprecations
human
life
dead
bodiesall
were
engulfed
in
one
terrific
crash
the
three
first
compartments
became
one
sepulchral
sink
into
which
fell
grimly
back
in
the
order
of
their
weight
every
vegetable
mineral
or
human
fragment
then
the
lighter
sand
and
ash
came
down
in
turn
stretching
like
a
winding
sheet
and
smoking
over
the
dismal
scene

has
made
of
all
of
those

a
chaos

more
terrible
than
the
chaos

before

there
remained
nothing
of
the
three
compartmentsnothing
by
which
god
could
have
recognized
his
handiwork
as
for
porthos
after
having
hurled
the
barrel
of
powder
amidst
his
enemies
he
had
fled
as
aramis
had
directed
him
to
do
and
had
gained
the
last
compartment
into
which
air
light
and
sunshine
penetrated
through
the
opening
scarcely
had
he
turned
the
angle
which
separated
the
third
compartment
from
the
fourth
when
he
perceived
at
a
hundred
paces
from
him
the
bark
dancing
on
the
waves
there
were
his
friends
there
liberty

life
and
victory
six
more
of
his
formidable
strides
and
he
would
be
out
of
the
vault
out
of
the
vault
a
dozen
of
his
vigorous
leaps
and
he
would
reach
the
canoe
suddenly
he
felt
his
knees
give
way
his
knees
seemed
powerless
his
legs
to
yield
beneath
him
oh
oh
murmured
he
there
is
my
weakness
seizing
me
again
i
can
walk
no
further
what
is
this
aramis
perceived
him
through
the

unable

him
to

saying

words
he
fell
upon
his
knees
but
with
his
mighty
hands
he
clung
to
the
rocks
and
raised
himself
up
again

quick
repeated
aramis
bending
forward
towards

blow
up

monseigneur
shouted
the
bretons
to
porthos
who
was
floundering
as
in
a
dream
but
there
was
no
time
the
explosion
thundered
earth
gaped
the
smoke
which
hurled
through
the
clefts
obscured
the
sky
the
sea
flowed
back
as
though
driven
by
the
blast
of
flame
which
darted
from
the
grotto
as
if
from
the
jaws
of
some
gigantic
fiery
chimera
the
reflux
took
the
bark
out
twenty
toises
the
solid
rocks
cracked
to
their
base
and
separated
like
blocks
beneath
the
operation
of
the
wedge
a
portion
of
the
vault
was
carried
up
towards
heaven
as
if
it
had
been
built
of
cardboard
the
green
and
blue
and
topaz
conflagration
and
black
lava
of
liquefactions
clashed
and
combated
an
instant
beneath
a
majestic
dome
of
smoke
then
oscillated
declined
and
fell
successively
the
mighty
monoliths
of
rock
which
the
violence
of
the
explosion
had
not
been
able
to
uproot
from
the
bed
of
ages
they
bowed
to
each
other
like
grave
and
stiff
old
men
then
prostrating
themselves
lay
down
forever
in
their
dusty
tomb
this
frightful
shock
seemed
to
restore
porthos
the
strength
that
he
had
lost
he
arose
a
giant
among
granite
giants
but
at
the
moment
he
was
flying
between
the
double
hedge
of
granite
phantoms
these
latter
which
were
no
longer
supported
by
the
corresponding
links
began
to
roll
and
totter
round
our
titan
who
looked
as
if
precipitated
from
heaven
amidst
rocks
which
he
had
just
been
launching
porthos
felt
the
very
earth
beneath
his
feet
becoming
jellytremulous
he
stretched
both
hands
to
repulse
the
falling
rocks
a
gigantic
block
was
held
back
by
each
of
his
extended
arms
he
bent
his
head
and
a
third
granite
mass
sank
between
his
shoulders
for
an
instant
the
power
of
porthos
seemed
about
to
fail
him
but
this
new
hercules
united
all
his
force
and
the
two
walls
of
the
prison
in
which
he
was
buried
fell
back
slowly
and
gave
him
place
for
an
instant
he
appeared
in
this
frame
of
granite
like
the
angel
of
chaos
but
in
pushing
back
the
lateral
rocks
he
lost
his
point
of
support
for
the
monolith
which
weighed
upon
his
shoulders
and
the
boulder
pressing
upon
him
with
all
its
weight
brought
the
giant
down
upon
his
knees
the
lateral
rocks
for
an
instant
pushed
back
drew
together
again
and
added
their
weight
to
the
ponderous
mass
which
would
have
been
sufficient
to
crush
ten
men
the
hero
fell
without
a
groanhe
fell
while
answering
aramis
with
words
of
encouragement
and
hope
for
thanks
to
the
powerful
arch
of
his
hands
for
an
instant
he
believed
that
like
enceladus
he
would
succeed
in
shaking
off
the
triple
load
but
by
degrees
aramis
beheld
the
block
sink
the
hands
strung
for
an
instant
the
arms
stiffened
for
a
last
effort
gave
way
the
extended
shoulders
sank
wounded
and
torn
and
the
rocks
continued
to
gradually
collapse

porthos
cried
aramis
tearing
his
hair

where
are
you

here
here
murmured
porthos
with
a
voice
growing
evidently
weaker
patience
patience
scarcely
had
he
pronounced
these
words
when
the
impulse
of
the
fall
augmented
the
weight
the
enormous
rock
sank
down
pressed
by
those
others
which
sank
in
from
the
sides
and
as
it
were
swallowed
up
porthos
in
a
sepulcher
of
badly
jointed
stones
on
hearing
the
dying
voice
of
his
friend
aramis
had
sprung
to
land
two
of
the
bretons
followed
him
with
each
a
lever
in
his
handone

sufficient
to
take

of
the

valiant
gladiator
guided
them
amidst
the
ruins
aramis
animated
active
and
young
as
at
twenty
sprang
towards
the
triple
mass
and
with
his
hands
delicate
as
those
of
a
woman
raised
by
a
miracle
of
strength
the
cornerstone
of
this
great
granite
grave
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
darkness
of
that
charnelhouse
of
the
still
brilliant
eye
of
his
friend
to
whom
the
momentary
lifting
of
the
mass
restored
a
momentary
respiration
the
two
men
came
rushing
up
grasped
their
iron
levers
united
their
triple
strength
not
merely
to
raise
it
but
sustain
it
all
was
useless
they
gave
way
with
cries
of
grief
and
the
rough
voice
of
porthos
seeing
them
exhaust
themselves
in
a
useless
struggle
murmured
in
an
almost
cheerful
tone
those
supreme
words
which
came
to
his
lips
with
the
last
respiration
too
heavy
after
which
his
eyes
darkened
and
closed
his
face
grew
ashy
pale
the
hands
whitened
and
the
colossus
sank
quite
down
breathing
his
last
sigh
with
him
sank
the
rock
which
even
in
his
dying
agony
he
had
still
held
up
the
three
men
dropped
the
levers
which
rolled
upon
the
tumulary
stone
then
breathless
pale
his
brow
covered
with
sweat
aramis
listened
his
breast
oppressed
his
heart
ready
to
break
nothing
more
the
giant
slept
the
eternal
sleep
in
the
sepulcher

god
had

about
him

laid
him
down

out
in

in

as
the

receded

still

his

upon

with
the
last
ray
of
daylight
the
shore
faded
on
the
horizon
not
a
word
escaped
him
not
a
sigh
rose
from
his
deep
breast
the
superstitious
bretons
looked
upon
him
trembling
such
silence
was
not
that
of
a
man
it
was
the
silence
of
a
statue
in
the
meantime
with
the
first
gray
lines
that
lighted
up
the
heavens
the
canoe
hoisted
its
little
sail
which
swelling
with
the
kisses
of
the
breeze
and
carrying
them
rapidly
from
the
coast
made
bravest
way
towards
spain
across
the
dreaded
gulf
of
gascony
so
rife
with
storms
but
scarcely
half
an
hour
after
the
sail
had
been
hoisted
the
rowers
became
inactive
reclining
on
their
benches
and
making
an
eyeshade
with
their
hands
pointed
out
to
each
other
a
white
spot
which
appeared
on
the
horizon
as
motionless
as
a
gull
rocked
by
the
viewless
respiration
of
the
waves
but
that
which
might
have
appeared
motionless
to
ordinary
eyes
was
moving
at
a
quick
rate
to
the
experienced
eye
of
the
sailor
that
which
appeared
stationary
upon
the
ocean
was
cutting
a
rapid
way
through
it
for
some
time
seeing
the
profound
torpor
in
which
their
master
was
plunged
they
did
not
dare
to
rouse
him
and
satisfied
themselves
with
exchanging
their
conjectures
in
whispers
aramis
in
fact
so
vigilant
so
activearamis
whose
eye
like
that
of
the
lynx
watched
without
ceasing
and
saw
better
by
night
than
by
dayaramis
seemed
to
sleep
in
this
despair
of
soul
an
hour
passed
thus
during
which
daylight
gradually
disappeared
but
during
which
also
the
sail
in
view
gained
so
swiftly
on
the
bark
that
goenne
one
of
the
three
sailors
ventured
to
say
aloud
monseigneur
we
are
being
chased
aramis
made
no
reply
the
ship
still
gained
upon
them
then
of
their
own
accord
two
of
the
sailors
by
the
direction
of
the
patron
yves
lowered
the
sail
in
order
that
that
single
point
upon
the
surface
of
the
waters
should
cease
to
be
a
guide
to
the
eye
of
the
enemy
pursuing
them
on
the
part
of
the
ship
in
sight
on
the
contrary
two
more
small
sails
were
run
up
at
the
extremities
of
the
masts
unfortunately
it
was
the
time
of
the
finest
and
longest
days
of
the
year
and
the
moon
in
all
her
brilliancy
succeeded
inauspicious
daylight
the
balancelle
which
was
pursuing
the
little
bark
before
the
wind
had
then
still
half
an
hour
of
twilight
and
a
whole
night
almost
as
light
as
day
monseigneur
monseigneur
we
are
lost
said
the
captain
look
they
see
us
plainly
though
we
have
lowered
sail
that
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
murmured
one
of
the
sailors
since
they
say
that
by
the
aid
of
the
devil
the
parisfolk
have
fabricated
instruments
with
which
they
see
as
well
at
a
distance
as
near
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
aramis
took
a
telescope
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
focussed
it
silently
and
passing
it
to
the
sailor
here
said
he
look
the
sailor
hesitated
dont
be
alarmed
said
the
bishop
there
is
no
sin
in
it
and
if
there
is
any
sin
i
will
take
it
on
myself
the
sailor
lifted
the
glass
to
his
eye
and
uttered
a
cry
he
believed
that
the
vessel
which
appeared
to
be
distant
about
cannonshot
had
at
a
single
bound
cleared
the
whole
distance
but
on
withdrawing
the
instrument
from
his
eye
he
saw
that
except
the
way
which
the
balancelle
had
been
able
to
make
during
that
brief
instant
it
was
still
at
the
same
distance
so
murmured
the
sailor
they
can
see
us
as
we
see
them
they
see
us
said
aramis
and
sank
again
into
impassibility
whatthey

said
yves
impossible
well

look
yourself
said
the

and
he
passed
him
the

monseigneur
assures
me
that
the
devil
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
asked
yves
aramis
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
skipper
lifted
the

to
his

it

firing
at
us
and
by
a
mechanical
movement
the
skipper
put
aside
the
telescope
and
the
pursuing
ship
relegated
to
the
horizon
appeared
again
in
its
true
aspect
the
vessel
was
still
at
the
distance
of
nearly
a
league
but
the
maneuver
sighted
thus
was
not
less
real
a
light
cloud
of
smoke
appeared
beneath
the
sails
more
blue
than
they
and
spreading
like
a
flower
opening
then
at
about
a
mile
from
the
little
canoe
they
saw
the
ball
take
the
crown
off
two
or
three
waves
dig
a
white
furrow
in
the
sea
and
disappear
at
the
end
of
it
as
inoffensive
as
the
stone
with
which
in
play
a
boy
makes
ducks
and
drakes
it
was
at
once
a
menace
and
a
warning
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
patron
they
will
sink
us
said
goenne
give
us
absolution
monseigneur
and
the
sailors
fell
on
their
knees
before
him
you
forget
that
they
can
see
you
said
he
that
is
true
said
the
sailors
ashamed
of
their
weakness
give
us
your
orders
monseigneur
we
are
prepared
to
die
for
you
let
us
wait
said
aramis
howlet
us
wait
yes
do
you
not
see
as
you
just
now
said
that
if
we
endeavor
to
fly
they
will
sink
us
but
perhaps
the
patron
ventured
to
say
perhaps
under
cover
of
night
we
could
escape
them
oh
said
aramis
they
have
no
doubt
greek
fire
with
which
to
lighten
their
own
course
and
ours
likewise
at
the
same
moment
as
if
the
vessel
was
responsive
to
the
appeal
of
aramis
a
second
cloud
of
smoke
mounted
slowly
to
the
heavens
and
from
the
bosom
of
that
cloud
sparkled
an
arrow
of
flame
which
described
a
parabola
like
a
rainbow
and
fell
into
the
sea
where
it
continued
to
burn
illuminating
a
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
league
in
diameter
the
bretons
looked
at
each
other
in
terror
you
see
plainly
said
aramis
it
will
be
better
to
wait
for
them
the
oars
dropped
from
the
hands
of
the
sailors
and
the
bark
ceasing
to
make
way
rocked
motionless
upon
the
summits
of
the
waves
night
came
on
but
still
the
ship
drew
nearer
it
might
be
imagined
it
redoubled
its
speed
with
darkness
from
time
to
time
as
a
vulture
rears
its
head
out
of
its
nest
the
formidable
greek
fire
darted
from
its
sides
and
cast
its
flame
upon
the
ocean
like
an
incandescent
snowfall
at
last
it
came
within
musketshot
all
the
men
were
on
deck
arms
in
hand
the
cannoniers
were
at
their
guns
the
matches
burning
it
might
be
thought
they
were
about
to
board
a
frigate
and
to
fight
a
crew
superior
in
number
to
their
own
not
to
attempt
the
capture
of
a
canoe
manned
by
four
people
surrender
cried
the
commander
of
the
balancelle
with
the
aid
of
his
speakingtrumpet
the
sailors
looked
at
aramis
aramis
made
a
sign
with
his
head
yves
waved
a
white
cloth
at
the
end
of
a
gaff
this
was
like
striking
their
flag
the
pursuer
came
on
like
a
racehorse
it
launched
a
fresh
greek
fire
which
fell
within
twenty
paces
of
the
little
canoe
and
threw
a
light
upon
them
as
white
as
sunshine
at
the
first
sign
of
resistance
cried
the
commander
of
the
balancelle
fire
the
soldiers
brought
their
muskets
to
the
present
did
we
not
say
we
surrendered
said
yves
alive
alive
captain
cried
one
excited
soldier
they
must
be
taken
alive
well
yesliving
said
the
captain
then
turning
towards
the
bretons
your
lives
are
safe
my
friends
cried
he
all
but
the
chevalier
dherblay
aramis
stared
imperceptibly
for
an
instant
his
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
depths
of
the
ocean
illumined
by
the
last
flashes
of
the
greek
fire
which
ran
along
the
sides
of
the
waves
played
on
the
crests
like
plumes
and
rendered
still
darker
and
more
terrible
the
gulfs
they
covered
do
you
hear
monseigneur
said
the
sailors
yes
what
are
your
orders
accept
but
you
monseigneur
aramis
leaned
still
more
forward
and
dipped
the
ends
of
his
long
white
fingers
in
the
green
limpid
waters
of
the
sea
to
which
he
turned
with
smiles
as
to
a
friend
accept
repeated
he
we
accept
repeated
the
sailors
but
what
security
have
we
the
word
of
a
gentleman
said
the
officer
by
my
rank
and
by
my
name
i
swear
that
all
except
m
le
chevalier
dherblay
shall
have
their
lives
spared
i
am
lieutenant
of
the
kings
frigate
the
pomona
and
my
name
is
louis
constant
de
pressigny
with
a
rapid
gesture
aramisalready
bent
over
the
side
of
the
bark
towards
the
seadrew
himself
up
and
with
a
flashing
eye
and
a
smile
upon
his
lips
throw
out
the
ladder
messieurs
said
he
as
if
the
command
had
belonged
to
him
he
was
obeyed
when
aramis
seizing
the
rope
ladder
walked
straight
up
to
the
commander
with
a
firm
step
looked
at
him
earnestly
made
a
sign
to
him
with
his
hand
a
mysterious
and
unknown
sign
at
sight
of
which
the
officer
turned
pale
trembled
and
bowed
his
head
the
sailors
were
profoundly
astonished
without
a
word
aramis
then
raised
his
hand
to
the
eyes
of
the
commander
and
showed
him
the
collet
of
a
ring
he
wore
on
the
ringfinger
of
his
left
hand
and
while
making
this
sign
aramis
draped
in
cold
and
haughty
majesty
had
the
air
of
an
emperor
giving
his
hand
to
be
kissed
the
commandant
who
for
a
moment
had
raised
his
head
bowed
a
second
time
with
marks
of
the
most
profound
respect
then
stretching
his
hand
out
in
his
turn
towards
the
poop
that
is
to
say
towards
his
own
cabin
he
drew
back
to
allow
aramis
to
go
first
the
three
bretons
who
had
come
on
board
after
their
bishop
looked
at
each
other
stupefied
the
crew
were
awed
to
silence
five
minutes
after
the
commander
called
the
second
lieutenant
who
returned
immediately
ordering
the
head
to
be
put
towards
corunna
whilst
this
order
was
being
executed
aramis
reappeared
upon
the
deck
and
took
a
seat
near
the
bastingage
night
had
fallen
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
yet
aramis
looked
incessantly
towards
belleisle
yves
then
approached
the
captain
who
had
returned
to
take
his
post
in
the
stern
and
said
in
a
low
and
humble
voice
what
course
are
we
to
follow
captain
we
take
what
course
monseigneur
pleases
replied
the
officer
aramis
passed
the
night
leaning
upon
the
bastingage
yves
on
approaching
him
next
morning
remarked
that
the
night
must
have
been
a
very
damp
one
for
the
wood
on
which
the
bishops
head
had
rested
was
soaked
with
dew
who
knowsthat
dew
was
it
may
be
the
first
tears
that
had
ever
fallen
from
the
eyes
of
aramis
what
epitaph
would
have
been
worth
that
good
porthos
chapter
lii
m
de
gesvress
round
dartagnan
was
little
used
to
resistance
like
that
he
had
just
experienced
he
returned
profoundly
irritated
to
nantes
irritation
with
this
vigorous
man
usually
vented
itself
in
impetuous
attack
which
few
people
hitherto
were
they
king
were
they
giants
had
been
able
to
resist
trembling
with
rage
he
went
straight
to
the
castle
and
asked
an
audience
with
the
king
it
might
be
about
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
and
since
his
arrival
at
nantes
the
king
had
been
an
early
riser
but
on
arriving
at
the
corridor
with
which
we
are
acquainted
dartagnan
found
m
de
gesvres
who
stopped
him
politely
telling
him
not
to
speak
too
loud
and
disturb
the
king
is
the
king
asleep
said
dartagnan
well
i
will
let
him
sleep
but
about
what
oclock
do
you
suppose
he
will
rise
oh
in
about
two
hours
his
majesty
has
been
up
all
night
dartagnan
took
his
hat
again
bowed
to
m
de
gesvres
and
returned
to
his
own
apartments
he
came
back
at
halfpast
nine
and
was
told
that
the
king
was
at
breakfast
that
will
just
suit
me
said
dartagnan
i
will
talk
to
the
king
while
he
is
eating
m
de
brienne
reminded
dartagnan
that
the
king
would
not
see
any
one
at
mealtime
but
said
dartagnan
looking
askant
at
brienne
you
do
not
know
perhaps
monsieur
that
i
have
the
privilege
of
entree
anywhereand
at
any
hour
brienne
took
the
captains
hand
kindly
and
said
not
at
nantes
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
the
king
in
this
journey
has
changed
everything
dartagnan
a
little
softened
asked
about
what
oclock
the
king
would
have
finished
his
breakfast
we
dont
know
ehdont
know
what
does
that
mean
you
dont
know
how
much
time
the
king
devotes
to
eating
it
is
generally
an
hour
and
if
we
admit
that
the
air
of
the
loire
gives
an
additional
appetite
we
will
extend
it
to
an
hour
and
a
half
that
is
enough
i
think
i
will
wait
where
i
am
oh
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
the
order
of
the
day
is
not
to
allow
any
person
to
remain
in
this
corridor
i
am
on
guard
for
that
particular
purpose
dartagnan
felt
his
anger
mounting
to
his
brain
a
second
time
he
went
out
quickly
for
fear
of
complicating
the
affair
by
a
display
of
premature
illhumor
as
soon
as
he
was
out
he
began
to
reflect
the
king
said
he
will
not
receive
me
that
is
evident
the
young
man
is
angry
he
is
afraid
beforehand
of
the
words
that
i
may
speak
to
him
yes
but
in
the
meantime
belleisle
is
besieged
and
my
two
friends
by
now
probably
taken
or
killed
poor
porthos
as
to
master
aramis
he
is
always
full
of
resources
and
i
am
easy
on
his
account
but
no
no
porthos
is
not
yet
an
invalid
nor
is
aramis
in
his
dotage
the
one
with
his
arm
the
other
with
his
imagination
will
find
work
for
his
majestys
soldiers
who
knows
if
these
brave
men
may
not
get
up
for
the
edification
of
his
most
christian
majesty
a
little
bastion
of
saintgervais
i
dont
despair
of
it
they
have
cannon
and
a
garrison
and
yet
continued
dartagnan
i
dont
know
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
stop
the
combat
for
myself
alone
i
will
not
put
up
with
either
surly
looks
or
insults
from
the
king
but
for
my
friends
i
must
put
up
with
everything
shall
i
go
to
m
colbert
now
there
is
a
man
i
must
acquire
the
habit
of
terrifying
i
will
go
to
m
colbert
and
dartagnan
set
forward
bravely
to
find
m
colbert
but
was
informed
that
he
was
working
with
the
king
at
the
castle
of
nantes
good
cried
he
the
times
have
come
again
in
which
i
measured
my
steps
from
de
treville
to
the
cardinal
from
the
cardinal
to
the
queen
from
the
queen
to
louis
xiii
truly
is
it
said
that
men
in
growing
old
become
children
againto
the
castle
then
he
returned
thither
m
de
lyonne
was
coming
out
he
gave
dartagnan
both
hands
but
told
him
that
the
king
had
been
busy
all
the
preceding
evening
and
all
night
and
that
orders
had
been
given
that
no
one
should
be
admitted
not
even
the
captain
who
takes
the
order
cried
dartagnan
i
think
that
is
rather
too
strong
not
even
he
said
m
de
lyonne
since
that
is
the
case
replied
dartagnan
wounded
to
the
heart
since
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
who
has
always
entered
the
kings
chamber
is
no
longer
allowed
to
enter
it
his
cabinet
or
his
salleamanger
either
the
king
is
dead
or
his
captain
is
in
disgrace
do
me
the
favor
then
m
de
lyonne
who
are
in
favor
to
return
and
tell
the
king
plainly
i
send
him
my
resignation
dartagnan
beware
of
what
you
are
doing
for
friendships
sake
go
and
he
pushed
him
gently
towards
the
cabinet
well
i
will
go
said
lyonne
dartagnan
waited
walking
about
the
corridor
in
no
enviable
mood
lyonne
returned
well
what
did
the
king
say
exclaimed
dartagnan
he
simply
answered
tis

replied
lyonne
that
it
was
well
said
the
captain
with
an
explosion
that
is
to
say
that
he
accepts
it
good
now
then
i
am
free

the
pleasure

a
bourgeois
about
to
breathe
at
liberty
takes
his
farewell
of
you
and
without
waiting
longer
the
captain
sprang
from
the
terrace
down
the
staircase
where
he
had
picked
up
the
fragments
of
gourvilles
letter
five
minutes
after
he
was
at
the
hostelry
where
according
to
the
custom
of
all
great
officers
who
have
lodgings
at
the
castle
he
had
taken
what
was
called
his
citychamber
but
when
he
arrived
there
instead
of
throwing
off
his
sword
and
cloak
he
took
his
pistols
put
his
money
into
a
large
leather
purse
sent
for
his
horses
from
the
castlestables
and
gave
orders
that
would
ensure
their
reaching
vannes
during
the
night
everything
went
on
according
to
his
wishes
at
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
he
was
putting
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
when
m
de
gesvres
appeared
at
the
head
of
twelve
guards
in
front
of
the
hostelry
dartagnan
saw
all
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
could
not
fail
seeing
thirteen
men
and
thirteen
horses
but
he
feigned
not
to
observe
anything
and
was
about
to
put
his
horse
in
motion
gesvres
rode
up
to
him
monsieur
dartagnan
said
he
aloud
ah
monsieur
de
gesvres

the
part
of

three
days
ago

in
search
of
m
fouquet
oh

overdelicate
with

said
dartagnan
with
a
bantering
air
the
king
is
disengaged
for
heavens
sake
captain
said
m
de
gesvres
in
a
low
voice
to
the
musketeer
do
not
compromise
yourself
these
men
hear
you
dartagnan
laughed
aloud
and
replied
march
people
who
are
arrested
are
placed
between
the
six
first
guards
and
the
six
last
but
as
i
am
not
arresting
you
said
m
de
gesvres
you
will
march
behind
with
me
if
you
please
well
said
dartagnan
that
is
very
polite
duke
and
you
are
right
in
being
so
for
if
ever
i
had
had
to
make
my
rounds
near
your
chambredeville
i
should
have
been
courteous
to
you
i
assure
you
on
the
word
of
a
gentleman
now
one
favor
more
what
does
the
king
want
with
me
oh
the
king
is
furious
very
well
the
king
who
has
thought
it
worth
while
to
be
angry
may
take
the
trouble
to
grow
calm
again
that
is
all
i
shant
die
of
that
i
will
swear
no
but
buti
shall
be
sent
to
keep
company
with
unfortunate
m
fouquet
mordioux
that
is
a
gallant
man
a
worthy
man
we
shall
live
very
sociably
together
i
will
be
sworn
here
we
are
at
our
place
of
destination
said
the
duke
captain
for
heavens
sake
be
calm
with
the
king
ah
ah
you
are
playing
the
brave
man
with
me
duke
said
dartagnan
throwing
one
of
his
defiant
glances
over
gesvres
i
have
been
told
that
you
are
ambitious
of
uniting
your
guards
with
my
musketeers
this
strikes
me
as
a
splendid
opportunity
i
will
take
exceeding
good
care
not
to
avail
myself
of
it
captain
and
why
not
pray
oh
for
many
reasonsin
the
first
place
for
this
if
i
were
to
succeed
you
in
the
musketeers
after
having
arrested
you
ah
then
you
admit
you
have
arrested
me
no
i
dont
say
met
me
then
so
you
were
saying
if
you
were
to
succeed
me
after
having
arrested
me
your
musketeers
at
the
first
exercise
with
ball
cartridges
would
fire
my
way
by
mistake
oh
as
to
that
i
wont
say
for
the
fellows
do
love
me
a
little
gesvres
made
dartagnan
pass
in
first
and
took
him
straight
to
the
cabinet
where
louis
was
waiting
for
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
and
placed
himself
behind
his
colleague
in
the
antechamber
the
king
could
be
heard
distinctly
speaking
aloud
to
colbert
in
the
same
cabinet
where
colbert
might
have
heard
a
few
days
before
the
king
speaking
aloud
with
m
dartagnan
the
guards
remained
as
a
mounted
picket
before
the
principal
gate
and
the
report
was
quickly
spread
throughout
the
city
that
monsieur
le
capitaine
of
the
musketeers
had
been
arrested
by
order
of
the
king
then
these
men
were
seen
to
be
in
motion
and
as
in
the
good
old
times
of
louis
xiii
and
m
de
treville
groups
were
formed
and
staircases
were
filled
vague
murmurs
issuing
from
the
court
below
came
rolling
to
the
upper
stories
like
the
distant
moaning
of
the
waves
m
de
gesvres
became
uneasy
he
looked
at
his
guards
who
after
being
interrogated
by
the
musketeers
who
had
just
got
among
their
ranks
began
to
shun
them
with
a
manifestation
of
innocence
dartagnan
was
certainly
less
disturbed
by
all
this
than
m
de
gesvres
the
captain
of
the
guards
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
seated
himself
on
the
ledge
of
a
window
whence
with
his
eagle
glance
he
saw
all
that
was
going
on
without
the
least
emotion
no
step
of
the
progressive
fermentation
which
had
shown
itself
at
the
report
of
his
arrest
escaped
him
he
foresaw
the
very
moment
the
explosion
would
take
place
and
we
know
that
his
previsions
were
in
general
correct
it
would
be
very
whimsical
thought
he
if
this
evening
my
praetorians
should
make
me
king
of
france
how
i
should
laugh
but
at
the
height
all
was
stopped
guards
musketeers
officers
soldiers
murmurs
uneasiness
dispersed
vanished
died
away
there
was
an
end
of
menace
and
sedition
one
word
had
calmed
the
waves
the
king
had
desired
brienne
to
say
hush
messieurs
you
disturb
the
king
dartagnan
sighed
all
is
over
said
he
the
musketeers
of
the
present
day
are
not
those
of
his
majesty
louis
xiii
all
is
over
monsieur
dartagnan
you
are
wanted
in
the
antechamber
of
the
king
proclaimed
an
usher
chapter
liii
king
louis
xiv
the
king
was
seated
in
his
cabinet
with
his
back
turned
towards
the
door
of
entrance
in
front
of
him
was
a
mirror
in
which
while
turning
over
his
papers
he
could
see
at
a
glance
those
who
came
in
he
did
not
take
any
notice
of
the
entrance
of
dartagnan
but
spread
above
his
letters
and
plans
the
large
silk
cloth
he
used
to
conceal
his
secrets
from
the
importunate
dartagnan
understood
this
byplay
and
kept
in
the
background
so
that
at
the
end
of
a
minute
the
king
who
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
save
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
was
obliged
to
cry
is
not
m
dartagnan
there
i
am
here
sire
replied
the
musketeer
advancing
well
monsieur
said
the
king
fixing
his
pellucid
eyes
on
dartagnan
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
i
sire
replied
the
latter
who
watched
the
first
blow
of
his
adversary
to
make
a
good
retort
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
your
majesty
unless
it
be
that
you
have
caused
me
to
be
arrested
and
here
i
am
the
king
was
going
to
reply
that
he
had
not
had
dartagnan
arrested
but
any
such
sentence
appeared
too
much
like
an
excuse
and
he
was
silent
dartagnan
likewise
preserved
an
obstinate
silence
monsieur
at
length
resumed
the
king
what
did
i
charge
you
to
go
and
do
at
belleisle
tell
me
if
you
please
the
king
while
uttering
these
words
looked
intently
at
his
captain
here
dartagnan
was
fortunate
the
king
seemed
to
place
the
game
in
his
hands
i
believe
replied
he
that
your
majesty
does
me
the
honor
to
ask
what
i
went
to
belleisle
to
accomplish
yes
monsieur
well
sire
i
know
nothing
about
it
it
is
not
of
me
that
question
should
be
asked
but
of
that
infinite
number
of
officers
of
all
kinds
to
whom
have
been
given
innumerable
orders
of
all
kinds
whilst
to
me
head
of
the
expedition
nothing
precise
was
said
or
stated
in
any
form
whatever
the
king
was
hurt
he
showed
it
by
his
reply
monsieur
said
he
orders
have
only
been
given
to
such
as
were
judged
faithful
and
therefore
i
have
been
astonished
sire
retorted
the
musketeer
that
a
captain
like
myself
who
ranks
with
a
marechal
of
france
should
have
found
himself
under
the
orders
of
five
or
six
lieutenants
or
majors
good
to
make
spies
of
possibly
but
not
at
all
fit
to
conduct
a
warlike
expedition
it
was
upon
this
subject
i
came
to
demand
an
explanation
of
your
majesty
when
i
found
the
door
closed
against
me
which
the
final
insult
offered
to
a
brave
man
has
led
me
to
quit
your
majestys
service
monsieur
replied
the
king
you
still
believe
that
you
are
living
in
an
age
when
kings
were
as
you
complain
of
having
been
under
the
orders
and
at
the
discretion
of
their
inferiors
you
seem
to
forget
that
a
king
owes
an
account
of
his
actions
to
none
but
god
i
forget
nothing
sire
said
the
musketeer
wounded
by
this
lesson
besides
i
do
not
see
in
what
an
honest
man
when
he
asks
of
his
king
how
he
has
illserved
him
offends
him
you
have
illserved
me
monsieur
by
siding
with
my
enemies
against
me
who
are
your
enemies
sire
the
men
i
sent
you
to
fight
two
men
the
enemies
of
the
whole
of
your
majestys
army
that
is
incredible
you
have
no
power
to
judge
of
my
will
but
i
have
to
judge
of
my
own
friendships
sire
he
who
serves
his
friends
does
not
serve
his
master
i
so
well
understand
this
sire
that
i
have
respectfully
offered
your
majesty
my
resignation
and
i
have
accepted
it
monsieur
said
the
king
before
being
separated
from
you
i
was
willing
to
prove
to
you
that
i
know
how
to
keep
my
word
your
majesty
has
kept
more
than
your
word
for
your
majesty
has
had
me
arrested
said
dartagnan
with
his
cold
bantering
air
you
did
not
promise
me
that
sire
the
king
would
not
condescend
to
perceive
the
pleasantry
and
continued
seriously
you
see
monsieur
to
what
grave
steps
your
disobedience
forces
me
my
disobedience
cried
dartagnan
red
with
anger
it
is
the
mildest
term
that
i
can
find
pursued
the
king
my
idea
was
to
take
and
punish
rebels
was
i
bound
to
inquire
whether
these
rebels
were
your
friends
or
not
but
i
was
replied
dartagnan
it
was
a
cruelty
on
your
majestys
part
to
send
me
to
capture
my
friends
and
lead
them
to
your
gibbets
it
was
a
trial
i
had
to
make
monsieur
of
pretended
servants
who
eat
my
bread
and
should
defend
my
person
the
trial
has
succeeded
ill
monsieur
dartagnan
for
one
bad
servant
your
majesty
loses
said
the
musketeer
with
bitterness
there
are
ten
who
on
that
same
day
go
through
a
like
ordeal
listen
to
me
sire
i
am
not
accustomed
to
that
service
mine
is
a
rebel
sword
when
i
am
required
to
do
ill
it
was
ill
to
send
me
in
pursuit
of
two
men
whose
lives
m
fouquet
your
majestys
preserver
implored
you
to
save
still
further
these
men
were
my
friends
they
did
not
attack
your
majesty
they
succumbed
to
your
blind
anger
besides
why
were
they
not
allowed
to
escape
what
crime
had
they
committed
i
admit
you
may
contest
with
me
the
right
of
judging
their
conduct
but
why
suspect
me
before
the
action
why
surround
me
with
spies
why
disgrace
me
before
the
army
why
me
in
whom
till
now
you
showed
the
most
entire
confidencewho
for
thirty
years
have
been
attached
to
your
person
and
have
given
you
a
thousand
proofs
of
my
devotionfor
it
must
be
said
now
that
i
am
accusedwhy
reduce
me
to
see
three
thousand
of
the
kings
soldiers
march
in
battle
against
two
men
one
would
say
you
have
forgotten
what
these
men
have
done
to
me
said
the
king
in
a
hollow
voice
and
that
it
was
no
merit
of
theirs
i
was
not
lost
sire
one
would
imagine
you
forget
that
i
was
there
enough
monsieur
dartagnan
enough
of
these
dominating
interests
which
arise
to
keep
the
sun
itself
from
my
interests
i
am
founding
a
state
in
which
there
shall
be
but
one
master
as
i
promised
you
the
moment
is
at
hand
for
me
to
keep
my
promise
you
wish
to
be
according
to
your
tastes
or
private
friendships
free
to
destroy
my
plans
and
save
my
enemies
i
will
thwart
you
or
will
drop
youseek
a
more
compliant
master
i
know
full
well
that
another
king
would
not
conduct
himself
as
i
do
and
would
allow
himself
to
be
dominated
by
you
at
the
risk
of
sending
you
some
day
to
keep
company
with
m
fouquet
and
the
rest
but
i
have
an
excellent
memory
and
for
me
services
are
sacred
titles
to
gratitude
to
impunity
you
shall
only
have
this
lesson
monsieur
dartagnan
as
the
punishment
of
your
want
of
discipline
and
i
will
not
imitate
my
predecessors
in
anger
not
having
imitated
them
in
favor
and
then
other
reasons
make
me
act
mildly
towards
you
in
the
first
place
because
you
are
a
man
of
sense
a
man
of
excellent
sense
a
man
of
heart
and
that
you
will
be
a
capital
servant
to
him
who
shall
have
mastered
you
secondly
because
you
will
cease
to
have
any
motives
for
insubordination
your
friends
are
now
destroyed
or
ruined
by
me
these
supports
on
which
your
capricious
mind
instinctively
relied
i
have
caused
to
disappear
at
this
moment
my
soldiers
have
taken
or
killed
the
rebels
of
belleisle
dartagnan
became
pale
taken
or
killed
cried
he
oh
sire
if
you
thought
what
you
tell
if
you
were
sure
you
were
telling
me
the
truth
i
should
forget
all
that
is
just
all
that
is
magnanimous
in
your
words
to
call
you
a
barbarous
king
and
an
unnatural
man
but
i
pardon
you
these
words
said
he
smiling
with
pride
i
pardon
them
to
a
young
prince
who
does
not
know
who
cannot
comprehend
what
such
men
as
m
dherblay
m
du
vallon
and
myself
are
taken
or
killed
ah
ah
sire
tell
me
if
the
news
is
true
how
much
has
it
cost
you
in
men
and
money
we
will
then
reckon
if
the
game
has
been
worth
the
stakes
as
he
spoke
thus
the
king
went
up
to
him
in
great
anger
and
said
monsieur
dartagnan
your
replies
are
those
of
a
rebel
tell
me
if
you
please
who
is
king
of
france
do
you
know
any
other
sire
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
coldly
i
very
well
remember
that
one
morning
at
vaux
you
addressed
that
question
to
many
people
who
did
not
answer
to
it
whilst
i
on
my
part
did
answer
to
it
if
i
recognized
my
king
on
that
day
when
the
thing
was
not
easy
i
think
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
the
question
of
me
now
when
your
majesty
and
i
are
alone
at
these
words
louis
cast
down
his
eyes
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
shade
of
the
unfortunate
philippe
passed
between
dartagnan
and
himself
to
evoke
the
remembrance
of
that
terrible
adventure
almost
at
the
same
moment
an
officer
entered
and
placed
a
dispatch
in
the
hands
of
the
king
who
in
his
turn
changed
color
while
reading
it
monsieur
said
he
what
i
learn
here
you
would
know
later
it
is
better
i
should
tell
you
and
that
you
should
learn
it
from
the
mouth
of
your
king
a
battle
has
taken
place
at
belleisle
is
it
possible
said
dartagnan
with
a
calm
air
though
his
heart
was
beating
fast
enough
to
choke
him
well
sire
well
monsieurand
i
have
lost
a
hundred
and
ten
men
a
beam
of
joy
and
pride
shone
in
the
eyes
of
dartagnan
and
the
rebels
said
he
the
rebels
have
fled
said
the
king
dartagnan
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
triumph
only
added
the
king
i
have
a
fleet
which
closely
blockades
belleisle
and
i
am
certain
not
a
bark
can
escape
so
that
said
the
musketeer
brought
back
to
his
dismal
idea
if
these
two
gentlemen
are
taken
they
will
be
hanged
said
the
king
quietly
and
do
they
know
it
replied
dartagnan
repressing
his
trembling
they
know
it
because
you
must
have
told
them
yourself
and
all
the
country
knows
it
then
sire
they
will
never
be
taken
alive
i
will
answer
for
that
ah
said
the
king
negligently
and
taking
up
his
letter
again
very
well
they
will
be
dead
then
monsieur
dartagnan
and
that
will
come
to
the
same
thing
since
i
should
only
take
them
to
have
them
hanged
dartagnan
wiped
the
sweat
which
flowed
from
his
brow
i
have
told
you
pursued
louis
xiv
that
i
would
one
day
be
an
affectionate
generous
and
constant
master
you
are
now
the
only
man
of
former
times
worthy
of
my
anger
or
my
friendship
i
will
not
spare
you
either
sentiment
according
to
your
conduct
could
you
serve
a
king
monsieur
dartagnan
who
should
have
a
hundred
kings
his
equals
in
the
kingdom
could
i
tell
me
do
with
such
weak
instruments
the
great
things
i
meditate
did
you
ever
see
an
artist
effect
great
works
with
an
unworthy
tool
far
from
us
monsieur
the
old
leaven
of
feudal
abuse
the
fronde
which
threatened
to
ruin
monarchy
has
emancipated
it
i
am
master
at
home
captain
dartagnan
and
i
shall
have
servants
who
lacking
perhaps
your
genius
will
carry
devotion
and
obedience
to
the
verge
of
heroism
of
what
consequence
i
ask
you
of
what
consequence
is
it
that
god
has
given
no
sense
to
arms
and
legs
it
is
to
the
head
he
has
given
genius
and
the
head
you
know
the
rest
obey
i
am
the
head
dartagnan
started
louis
xiv
continued
as
if
he
had
seen
nothing
although
this
emotion
had
not
by
any
means
escaped
him
now
let
us
conclude
between
us
two
the
bargain
i
promised
to
make
with
you
one
day
when
you
found
me
in
a
very
strange
predicament
at
blois
do
me
justice
monsieur
when
you
admit
i
do
not
make
any
one
pay
for
the
tears
of
shame
that
i
then
shed
look
around
you
lofty
heads
have
bowed
bow
yours
or
choose
such
exile
as
will
suit
you
perhaps
when
reflecting
upon
it
you
will
find
your
king
has
a
generous
heart
who
reckons
sufficiently
upon
your
loyalty
to
allow
you
to
leave
him
dissatisfied
when
you
possess
a
great
state
secret
you
are
a
brave
man
i
know
you
to
be
so
why
have
you
judged
me
prematurely
judge
me
from
this
day
forward
dartagnan
and
be
as
severe
as
you
please
dartagnan
remained
bewildered
mute
undecided
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
at
last
he
had
found
an
adversary
worthy
of
him
this
was
no
longer
trick
it
was
calculation
no
longer
violence
but
strength
no
longer
passion
but
will
no
longer
boasting
but
council
this
young
man
who
had
brought
down
a
fouquet
and
could
do
without
a
dartagnan
deranged
the
somewhat
headstrong
calculations
of
the
musketeer
come
let
us
see
what
stops
you
said
the
king
kindly
you
have
given
in
your
resignation
shall
i
refuse
to
accept
it
i
admit
that
it
may
be
hard
for
such
an
old
captain
to
recover
lost
goodhumor
oh
replied
dartagnan
in
a
melancholy
tone
that
is
not
my
most
serious
care
i
hesitate
to
take
back
my
resignation
because
i
am
old
in
comparison
with
you
and
have
habits
difficult
to
abandon
henceforward
you
must
have
courtiers
who
know
how
to
amuse
youmadmen
who
will
get
themselves
killed
to
carry
out
what
you
call
your
great
works
great
they
will
be
i
feelbut
if
by
chance
i
should
not
think
them
so
i
have
seen
war
sire
i
have
seen
peace
i
have
served
richelieu
and
mazarin
i
have
been
scorched
with
your
father
at
the
fire
of
rochelle
riddled
with
swordthrusts
like
a
sieve
having
grown
a
new
skin
ten
times
as
serpents
do
after
affronts
and
injustices
i
have
a
command
which
was
formerly
something
because
it
gave
the
bearer
the
right
of
speaking
as
he
liked
to
his
king
but
your
captain
of
the
musketeers
will
henceforward
be
an
officer
guarding
the
outer
doors
truly
sire
if
that
is
to
be
my
employment
from
this
time
seize
the
opportunity
of
our
being
on
good
terms
to
take
it
from
me
do
not
imagine
that
i
bear
malice
no
you
have
tamed
me
as
you
say
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
taming
me
you
have
lowered
me
by
bowing
me
you
have
convicted
me
of
weakness
if
you
knew
how
well
it
suits
me
to
carry
my
head
high
and
what
a
pitiful
mien
i
shall
have
while
scenting
the
dust
of
your
carpets
oh
sire
i
regret
sincerely
and
you
will
regret
as
i
do
the
old
days
when
the
king
of
france
saw
in
every
vestibule
those
insolent
gentlemen
lean
always
swearingcrossgrained
mastiffs
who
could
bite
mortally
in
the
hour
of
danger
or
of
battle
these
men
were
the
best
of
courtiers
to
the
hand
which
fed
themthey
would
lick
it
but
for
the
hand
that
struck
them
oh
the
bite
that
followed
a
little
gold
on
the
lace
of
their
cloaks
a
slender
stomach
in
their
hautsdechausses
a
little
sparkling
of
gray
in
their
dry
hair
and
you
will
behold
the
handsome
dukes
and
peers
the
haughty
marechaux
of
france
but
why
should
i
tell
you
all
this
the
king
is
master
he
wills
that
i
should
make
verses
he
wills
that
i
should
polish
the
mosaics
of
his
antechambers
with
satin
shoes
mordioux
that
is
difficult
but
i
have
got
over
greater
difficulties
i
will
do
it
why
should
i
do
it
because
i
love
moneyi
have
enough
because
i
am
ambitiousmy
career
is
almost
at
an
end
because
i
love
the
court
no
i
will
remain
here
because
i
have
been
accustomed
for
thirty
years
to
go
and
take
the
orderly
word
of
the
king
and
to
have
said
to
me
good
evening
dartagnan
with
a
smile
i
did
not
beg
for
that
smile
i
will
beg
for
are
you
content
sire
and
dartagnan
bowed
his
silver
head
upon
which
the
smiling
king
placed
his
white
hand
with
pride
thanks
my
old
servant
my
faithful
friend
said
he
as
reckoning
from
this
day
i
have
no
longer
any
enemies
in
france
it
remains
with
me
to
send
you
to
a
foreign
field
to
gather
your
marshals
baton
depend
upon
me
for
finding
you
an
opportunity
in
the
meanwhile
eat
of
my
very
best
bread
and
sleep
in
absolute
tranquillity
that
is
all
kind
and
well
said
dartagnan
much
agitated
but
those
poor
men
at
belleisle
one
of
them
in
particularso
good
so
brave
so
true
do
you
ask
their
pardon
of
me
upon
my
knees
sire
well
then
go
and
take
it
to
them
if
it
be
still
in
time
but
do
you
answer
for
them
with
my
life
sire
go
then
tomorrow
i
set
out
for
paris
return
by
that
time
for
i
do
not
wish
you
to
leave
me
in
the
future
be
assured
of
that
sire
said
dartagnan
kissing
the
royal
hand
and
with
a
heart
swelling
with
joy

friends
the
king
had
returned
to
paris
and
with
him
dartagnan
who
in
twentyfour
hours
having
made
with
greatest
care
all
possible
inquiries
at
belleisle
succeeded
in
learning
nothing
of
the
secret
so
well
kept
by
the
heavy
rock
of
locmaria
which
had
fallen
on
the
heroic
porthos
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
only
knew
what
those
two
valiant
menthese
two
friends
whose
defense
he
had
so
nobly
taken
up
whose
lives
he
had
so
earnestly
endeavored
to
saveaided
by
three
faithful
bretons
had
accomplished
against
a
whole
army
he
had
seen
spread
on
the
neighboring
heath
the
human
remains
which
had
stained
with
clouted
blood
the
scattered
stones
among
the
flowering
broom
he
learned
also
that
a
bark
had
been
seen
far
out
at
sea
and
that
like
a
bird
of
prey
a
royal
vessel
had
pursued
overtaken
and
devoured
the
poor
little
bird
that
was
flying
with
such
palpitating
wings
but
there
dartagnans
certainties
ended
the
field
of
supposition
was
thrown
open
now
what
could
he
conjecture
the
vessel
had
not
returned
it
is
true
that
a
brisk
wind
had
prevailed
for
three
days
but
the
corvette
was
known
to
be
a
good
sailer
and
solid
in
its
timbers
it
had
no
need
to
fear
a
gale
of
wind
and
it
ought
according
to
the
calculation
of
dartagnan
to
have
either
returned
to
brest
or
come
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
loire
such
was
the
news
ambiguous
it
is
true
but
in
some
degree
reassuring
to
him
personally
which
dartagnan
brought
to
louis
xiv
when
the
king
followed
by
all
the
court
returned
to
paris
louis
satisfied
with
his
successlouis
more
mild
and
affable
as
he
felt
himself
more
powerfulhad

ceased
for
an
instant
to
ride
beside
the
carriage

of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
everybody
was
anxious
to
amuse
the
two
queens
so
as
to
make
them
forget
this
abandonment
by
son
and
husband
everything
breathed
the
future
the
past
was
nothing
to
anybody
only
that
past
was
like
a
painful
bleeding
wound
to
the
hearts
of
certain
tender
and
devoted
spirits
scarcely
was
the
king
reinstalled
in
paris
when
he
received
a
touching
proof
of
this
louis
xiv
had
just
risen
and
taken
his
first
repast
when
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
presented
himself
before
him
dartagnan
was
pale
and
looked
unhappy
the
king
at
the
first
glance
perceived
the
change
in
a
countenance
generally
so
unconcerned
what
is
the
matter
dartagnan
said
he
sire
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
to
me
good
heavens
what
is
that
sire
i
have
lost
one
of
my
friends
m
du
vallon
in
the
affair
of
belleisle
and
while
speaking
these
words
dartagnan
fixed
his
falcon
eye
upon
louis
xiv
to
catch
the
first
feeling
that
would
show
itself
i
knew
it
replied
the
king
quietly
you
knew
it
and
did
not
tell
me
cried
the
musketeer
to
what
good
your
grief
my
friend
was
so
well
worthy
of
respect
it
was
my
duty
to
treat
it
gently
to
have
informed
you
of
this
misfortune
which
i
knew
would
pain
you
so
greatly
dartagnan
would
have
been
in
your
eyes
to
have
triumphed
over
you
yes
i
knew
that
m
du
vallon
had
buried
himself
beneath
the
rocks
of
locmaria
i
knew
that
m
dherblay
had
taken
one
of
my
vessels
with
its
crew
and
had
compelled
it
to
convey
him
to
bayonne
but
i
was
willing
you
should
learn
these
matters
in
a
direct
manner
in
order
that
you
might
be
convinced
my
friends
are
with
me
respected
and
sacred
that
always
in
me
the
man
will
sacrifice
himself
to
subjects
whilst
the
king
is
so
often
found
to
sacrifice
men
to
majesty
and
power
but
sire
how
could
you
know
how
do
you
yourself
know
dartagnan
by
this
letter
sire
which
m
dherblay
free
and
out
of
danger
writes
me
from
bayonne
look
here
said
the
king
drawing
from
a
casket
placed
upon
the
table
closet
to
the
seat
upon
which
dartagnan
was
leaning
here
is
a
letter
copied
exactly
from
that
of
m
dherblay
here
is
the
very
letter
which
colbert
placed
in
my
hands
a
week
before
you
received
yours
i
am
well
served
you
may
perceive
yes
sire
murmured
the
musketeer
you
were
the
only
man
whose
star
was
equal
to
the
task
of
dominating
the
fortune
and
strength
of
my
two
friends
you
have
used
your
power
sire
you
will
not
abuse
it
will
you
dartagnan
said
the
king
with
a
smile
beaming
with
kindness
i
could
have
m
dherblay
carried
off
from
the
territories
of
the
king
of
spain
and
brought
here
alive
to
inflict
justice
upon
him
but
dartagnan
be
assured
i
will
not
yield
to
this
first
and
natural
impulse
he
is
freelet
him
continue
free
oh
sire
you
will
not
always
remain
so
clement
so
noble
so
generous
as
you
have
shown
yourself
with
respect
to
me
and
m
dherblay
you
will
have
about
you
counselors
who
will
cure
you
of
that
weakness
no
dartagnan
you
are
mistaken
when
you
accuse
my
council
of
urging
me
to
pursue
rigorous
measures
the
advice
to
spare
m
dherblay
comes
from
colbert
himself
oh
sire
said
dartagnan
extremely
surprised
as
for
you
continued
the
king
with
a
kindness
very
uncommon
to
him
i
have
several
pieces
of
good
news
to
announce
to
you
but
you
shall
know
them
my
dear
captain
the
moment
i
have
made
my
accounts
all
straight
i
have
said
that
i
wish
to
make
and
would
make
your
fortune
that
promise
will
soon
become
reality
a
thousand
times
thanks
sire
i
can
wait
but
i
implore
you
whilst
i
go
and
practice
patience
that
your
majesty
will
deign
to
notice
those
poor
people
who
have
for
so
long
a
time
besieged
your
antechamber
and
come
humbly
to
lay
a
petition
at
your
feet
who
are
they
enemies
of
your
majesty
the
king
raised
his
head

names

pelisson
and
a
poet

de

the
king
took
a
moment
to
reflect
what
do
they
want
i
do
not
know
how
do
they
appear
in
great
affliction
what
do
they
say
nothing
what
do
they
do
they
weep
let
them
come
in
said
the
king
with
a
serious
brow
dartagnan
turned
rapidly
on
his
heel
raised
the
tapestry
which
closed
the
entrance
to
the
royal
chamber
and
directing
his
voice
to
the
adjoining
room
cried
enter
the
three
men
dartagnan
had
named
immediately
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
in
which
were
the
king
and
his
captain
a
profound
silence
prevailed
in
their
passage
the
courtiers
at
the
approach
of
the
friends
of
the
unfortunate
superintendent
of
finances
drew
back
as
if
fearful
of
being
affected
by
contagion
with
disgrace
and
misfortune
dartagnan
with
a
quick
step
came
forward
to
take
by
the
hand
the
unhappy
men
who
stood
trembling
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
he
led
them
in
front
of
the
kings
fauteuil
who
having
placed
himself
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
awaited
the
moment
of
presentation
and
was
preparing
himself
to
give
the
supplicants
a
rigorously
diplomatic
reception

first
of
the
friends
of

advance
was
pelisson
he
did
not
weep
but
his
tears
were
only
restrained
that
the
king
might
better
hear
his
voice
and
prayer

bit
his
lips
to
check
his
tears
out
of
respect

la
fontaine
buried
his
face
in
his
handkerchief
and
the
only
signs
of
life
he
gave
were
the
convulsive
motions
of
his
shoulders
raised
by
his
sobs
the
king
preserved
his
dignity
his
countenance
was
impassible
he
even
maintained
the
frown
which
appeared
when
dartagnan
announced
his
enemies
he
made
a
gesture
which
signified
speak
and
he
remained
standing
with
his
eyes
fixed
searchingly
on
these
desponding
men
pelisson
bowed
to
the
ground
and
la

knelt
as
people
do
in
churches
this
dismal
silence
disturbed
only
by
sighs
and
groans
began
to
excite
in
the
king
not
compassion
but
impatience
monsieur
pelisson
said
he
in
a
sharp
dry
tone
monsieur
gourville
and
you
monsieur
and
he
did
not
name
la
fontaine
i
cannot
without
sensible
displeasure
see
you
come
to
plead
for
one
of
the
greatest
criminals
it
is
the
duty
of
justice
to
punish
a
king
does
not
allow
himself
to
soften
save
at
the
tears
of
the
innocent
the
remorse
of
the
guilty
i
have
no
faith
either
in
the
remorse
of
m
fouquet
or
the
tears
of
his
friends
because
the
one
is
tainted
to
the
very
heart
and
the
others
ought
to
dread
offending
me
in
my
own
palace
for
these
reasons
i
beg
you
monsieur
pelisson
monsieur
gourville
and
you
monsieur
to
say
nothing
that
will
not
plainly
proclaim
the
respect
you
have
for
my
will
sire
replied
pelisson
trembling
at
these
words
we
are
come
to
say
nothing
to
your
majesty
that
is
not
the
most
profound
expression
of
the
most
sincere
respect
and
love
that
are
due
to
a
king
from
all
his
subjects
your
majestys
justice
is
redoubtable
every
one
must
yield
to
the
sentences
it
pronounces
we
respectfully
bow
before
it
far
from
us
the
idea
of
coming
to
defend
him
who
has
had
the
misfortune
to
offend
your
majesty
he
who
has
incurred
your
displeasure
may
be
a
friend
of
ours
but
he
is
an
enemy
to
the
state
we
abandon
him
but
with
tears
to
the
severity
of
the
king
besides
interrupted
the
king
calmed
by
that
supplicating
voice
and
those
persuasive
words
my
parliament
will
decide
i
do
not
strike
without
first
having
weighed
the
crime
my
justice
does
not
wield
the
sword
without
employing
first
a
pair
of
scales
therefore
we
have
every
confidence
in
that
impartiality
of
the
king
and
hope
to
make
our
feeble
voices
heard
with
the
consent
of
your
majesty

the
hour
for
defending
an
accused
friend
strikes
in

case

ask

turned
round
towards
the
angle
of

severe

the

mounted

thin
in

composed
of

of

keep
from

in

better

and
the
better

of
the
great
room

by

a
warlike
figure
appeared
upon
the
threshold
resplendent
in
the
full
light
of
the
sun
this
was
dartagnan
who
had
come
alone
to
the
gate
and
finding
nobody
to
hold
his
stirrup
had
tied
his
horse
to
the
knocker
and
announced
himself
the
splendor
of
daylight
invading
the
room
the
murmur
of
all
present
and
more
than
all
the
instinct
of
the
faithful
dog
drew
mousqueton
from
his
reverie
he
raised
his
head
recognized
the
old
friend
of
his
master
and
screaming
with
grief
he
embraced
his
knees
watering
the
floor
with
his
tears
dartagnan
raised
the
poor
intendant
embraced
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
brother
and
having
nobly
saluted
the
assembly
who
all
bowed
as
they
whispered
to
each
other
his
name
he
went
and
took
his
seat
at
the
extremity
of
the
great
carved
oak
hall
still
holding
by
the
hand
poor
mousqueton
who
was
suffocating
with
excess
of
woe
and
sank
upon
the
steps
then
the
procureur
who
like
the
rest
was
considerably
agitated
commenced
porthos
after
a
profession
of
faith
of
the
most
christian
character
asked
pardon
of
his
enemies
for
all
the
injuries
he
might
have
done
them
at
this
paragraph
a
ray
of
inexpressible
pride
beamed
from
the
eyes
of
dartagnan
he
recalled
to
his
mind
the
old
soldier
all
those
enemies
of
porthos
brought
to
earth
by
his
valiant
hand
he
reckoned
up
the
numbers
of
them
and
said
to
himself
that
porthos
had
acted
wisely
not
to
enumerate
his
enemies
or
the
injuries
done
to
them
or
the
task
would
have
been
too
much
for
the
reader

came
the
following

my

the
reader
stopped
to
take
breath
every
one
sighed
coughed
and
redoubled
his
attention
the
procureur
resumed
i
have
lived
without
having
any
children
and
it
is
probable
i
never
shall
have
any
which
to
me
is
a
cutting
grief
and
yet
i
am
mistaken
for
i
have
a
son
in
common
with
my
other
friends
that
is

true
son

this
young
nobleman
appears
to
me
extremely
worthy
to
succeed
the
valiant
gentleman
of
whom
i
am
the
friend
and
very
humble
servant
here
a
sharp
sound
interrupted
the
reader
it
was
dartagnans
sword
which
slipping
from
his
baldric
had
fallen
on
the
sonorous
flooring
every
one
turned
his
eyes
that
way
and
saw
that
a
large
tear
had
rolled
from
the
thick
lid
of
dartagnan
halfway
down
to
his
aquiline
nose
the
luminous
edge
of
which
shone
like
a
little
crescent
moon
this
is
why
continued
the
procureur
i
have
left
all
my

to
console
him
for
the
grief
he
seems
to
suffer
and
enable
him
to
add
more
luster
to
his
already
glorious
name
a
vague
murmur
ran
through
the
auditory
the
procureur
continued
seconded
by
the
flashing
eye
of
dartagnan
which
glancing
over
the
assembly
quickly
restored
the
interrupted
silence
on
condition
that
m
le
vicomte

do
give
to
m

my

i
leave
to
my

all
of
my
clothes
of
city
war
or
chase
to
the
number
of
fortyseven
suits
in
the
assurance
that
he
will
wear
them
till
they
are
worn
out
for
the
love
of
and
in
remembrance
of
his
master
moreover
i
bequeath
to
m

my
old
servant
and
faithful
friend
mousqueton
already
named
providing
that
the
said
vicomte
shall
so
act
that
mousqueton
shall
declare
when
dying
he
has
never
ceased
to
be
happy
on
hearing
these
words
mousqueton
bowed
pale
and
trembling
his
shoulders
shook
convulsively
his
countenance
compressed
by
a
frightful
grief
appeared
from
between
his
icy
hands
and
the
spectators
saw
him
stagger
and
hesitate
as
if
though
wishing
to
leave
the
hall
he
did
not
know
the
way
mousqueton
my
good
friend
said
dartagnan
go
and
make
your
preparations
i
will
take
you
with
me
to
athoss
house
whither
i
shall
go
on
leaving
pierrefonds
mousqueton
made
no
reply
he
scarcely
breathed
as
if
everything
in
that
hall
would
from
that
time
be
foreign
he
opened
the
door
and
slowly
disappeared
the
procureur
finished
his
reading
after
which
the
greater
part
of
those
who
had
come
to
hear
the
last
will
of
porthos
dispersed
by
degrees
many
disappointed
but
all
penetrated
with
respect
as
for
dartagnan
thus
left
alone
after
having
received
the
formal
compliments
of
the
procureur
he
was
lost
in
admiration
of
the
wisdom
of
the
testator
who
had
so
judiciously
bestowed
his
wealth
upon
the
most
necessitous
and
the
most
worthy
with
a
delicacy
that
neither
nobleman
nor
courtier
could
have
displayed
more
kindly
when
porthos
enjoined
raoul
de
bragelonne
to
give
dartagnan
all
that
he
would
ask
he
knew
well
our
worthy
porthos
that
dartagnan
would
ask
or
take
nothing
and
in
case
he
did
demand
anything
none
but
himself
could
say
what
porthos
left
a
pension
to
aramis
who
if
he
should
be
inclined
to
ask
too
much
was
checked
by
the
example
of
dartagnan
and
that
word
exile
thrown
out
by
the
testator
without
apparent
intention
was
it
not
the
mildest
most
exquisite
criticism
upon
that
conduct
of
aramis
which
had
brought
about
the
death
of
porthos
but
there
was
no
mention
of
athos
in
the
testament
of
the
dead
could

clearly
than

porthos
had
indeed
a
heart
said
dartagnan
to
himself
with
a
sigh
as
he
made
this
reflection
he
fancied
he
hard
a
groan
in
the
room
above
him
and
he
thought
immediately
of
poor
mousqueton
whom
he
felt
it
was
a
pleasing
duty
to
divert
from
his
grief
for
this
purpose
he
left
the
hall
hastily
to
seek
the
worthy
intendant
as
he
had
not
returned
he
ascended
the
staircase
leading
to
the
first
story
and
perceived
in
porthoss
own
chamber
a
heap
of
clothes
of
all
colors
and
materials
upon
which
mousqueton
had
laid
himself
down
after
heaping
them
all
on
the
floor
together
it
was
the
legacy
of
the
faithful
friend
those
clothes
were
truly
his
own
they
had
been
given
to
him
the
hand
of
mousqueton
was
stretched
over
these
relics
which
he
was
kissing
with
his
lips
with
all
his
face
and
covered
with
his
body
dartagnan
approached
to

the
poor
fellow

but

was
mistaken
mousqueton
was
dead

the
old
age
of
athos

these
affairs
were
separating
forever
the
four
musketeers
formerly
bound
together
in
a
manner
that
seemed
indissoluble
athos
left
alone
after
the
departure
of
raoul
began
to
pay
his
tribute
to
that
foretaste
of
death
which
is
called
the
absence
of
those
we
love
back
in
his
house
at
blois
no
longer
having
even
grimaud
to
receive
a
poor
smile
as
he
passed
through
the
parterre
athos
daily
felt
the
decline
of
vigor
of
a
nature
which
for
so
long
a
time
had
seemed
impregnable

which
had
been
kept
back
by
the
presence
of
the
beloved

with
that
cortege
of
pains
and
inconveniences
which
grows
by
geometrical
accretion
athos
had
no
longer
his
son
to
induce
him
to
walk
firmly
with
head
erect
as
a
good
example
he
had
no
longer
in
those
brilliant
eyes
of
the
young
man
an
everardent
focus
at
which
to
kindle
anew
the
fire
of
his
looks

then
must
it
be
said
that
nature
exquisite
in
tenderness
and
reserve
no
longer
finding
anything
to
understand
its
feelings
gave
itself
up

had
remained
a
young
man
to
his
sixtysecond
year
the
warrior
who
had
preserved
his
strength
in

freshness

athos
had
become
an
old
man
in
a
week
from
the
moment
at
which
he
lost
the
comfort
of
his
later
youth
still
handsome
though
bent
noble
but
sad
he
sought
since
his
solitude
the
deeper
glades
where
sunshine
scarcely
penetrated
he
discontinued
all
the
mighty
exercises
he
had
enjoyed
through
life
when
raoul
was
no
longer
with
him
the
servants
accustomed
to
see
him
stirring
with
the
dawn
at
all
seasons
were
astonished
to
hear
seven
oclock
strike
before
their
master
quitted
his
bed
athos
remained
in
bed
with
a
book
under
his
pillowbut
he
did
not
sleep
neither
did
he
read
remaining
in
bed
that
he
might
no
longer
have
to
carry
his
body
he
allowed
his
soul
and
spirit
to
wander
from
their
envelope
and
return
to
his
son
or
to
god
6
his
people
were
sometimes
terrified
to
see
him
for
hours
together
absorbed
in
silent
reverie
mute
and
insensible
he
no
longer
heard
the
timid
step
of
the
servant
who
came
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
to
watch
the
sleeping
or
waking
of
his
master
it
often
occurred
that
he
forgot
the
day
had
half
passed
away
that
the
hours
for
the
two
first
meals
were
gone
by
then
he
was
awakened
he
rose
descended
to
his
shady
walk
then
came
out
a
little
into
the
sun
as
though
to
partake
of
its
warmth
for
a
minute
in
memory
of
his
absent
child
and
then
the
dismal
monotonous
walk
recommenced
until
exhausted
he
regained
the
chamber
and
his
bed
his
domicile
by
choice
for
several
days
the
comte
did
not
speak
a
single
word
he
refused
to
receive
the
visits
that
were
paid
him
and
during
the
night
he
was
seen
to
relight
his
lamp
and
pass
long
hours
in
writing
or
examining
parchments
athos
wrote
one
of
these
letters
to
vannes
another
to
fontainebleau
they
remained
without
answers
we
know
why
aramis
had
quitted
france
and
dartagnan
was
traveling
from
nantes
to
paris
from
paris
to
pierrefonds
his
valet
de
chambre
observed
that
he
shortened
his
walk
every
day
by
several
turns
the
great
alley
of
limes
soon
became
too
long
for
feet
that
used
to
traverse
it
formerly
a
hundred
times
a
day
the
comte
walked
feebly
as
far
as
the
middle
trees
seated
himself
upon
a
mossy
bank
that
sloped
towards
a
sidewalk
and
there
waited
the
return
of
his
strength
or
rather
the
return
of
night
very
shortly
a
hundred
steps
exhausted
him
at
length
athos
refused
to
rise
at
all
he
declined
all
nourishment
and
his
terrified
people
although
he
did
not
complain
although
he
wore
a
smile
upon
his
lips
although
he
continued
to
speak
with
his
sweet
voicehis
people
went
to
blois
in
search
of
the
ancient
physician
of
the
late
monsieur
and
brought
him
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
could
see
the
comte
without
being
himself
seen
for
this
purpose
they
placed
him
in
a
closet
adjoining
the
chamber
of
the
patient
and
implored
him
not
to
show
himself
for
fear
of
displeasing
their
master
who
had
not
asked
for
a
physician
the
doctor
obeyed
athos
was
a
sort
of
model
for
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
the
blaisois
boasted
of
possessing
this
sacred
relic
of
french
glory
athos
was
a
great
seigneur
compared
with
such
nobles
as
the
king
improvised
by
touching
with
his
artificial
scepter
the
patchedup
trunks
of
the
heraldic
trees
of
the
province
people
respected
athos
we
say
and
they
loved
him
the
physician
could
not
bear
to
see
his
people
weep
to
see
flock
round
him
the
poor
of
the
canton
to
whom
athos
had
so
often
given
life
and
consolation
by
his
kind
words
and
his
charities
he
examined
therefore
from
the
depths
of
his
hidingplace
the
nature
of
that
mysterious
malady
which
bent
and
aged
more
mortally
every
day
a
man
but
lately
so
full
of
life
and
a
desire
to
live
he
remarked
upon
the
cheeks
of
athos
the
hectic
hue
of
fever
which
feeds
upon
itself
slow
fever
pitiless
born
in
a
fold
of
the
heart
sheltering
itself
behind
that
rampart
growing
from
the
suffering
it
engenders
at
once
cause
and
effect
of
a
perilous
situation
the
comte
spoke
to
nobody
he
did
not
even
talk
to
himself
his
thought
feared
noise
it
approached
to
that
degree
of
overexcitement
which
borders
upon
ecstasy
man
thus
absorbed
though
he
does
not
yet
belong
to
god
already
appertains
no
longer
to
the
earth
the
doctor
remained
for
several
hours
studying
this
painful
struggle
of
the
will
against
superior
power
he
was
terrified
at
seeing
those
eyes
always
fixed
ever
directed
on
some
invisible
object
was
terrified
at
the
monotonous
beating
of
that
heart
from
which
never
a
sigh
arose
to
vary
the
melancholy
state
for
often
pain
becomes
the
hope
of
the
physician
half
a
day
passed
away
thus
the
doctor
formed
his
resolution
like
a
brave
man
he
issued
suddenly
from
his
place
of
retreat
and
went
straight
up
to
athos
who
beheld
him
without
evincing
more
surprise
than
if
he
had
understood
nothing
of
the
apparition
monsieur
le
comte
i
crave
your
pardon
said
the
doctor
coming
up
to
the
patient
with
open
arms
but
i
have
a
reproach
to
make
youyou
shall
hear
me
and
he
seated
himself
by
the
pillow
of
athos
who
had
great
trouble
in
rousing
himself
from
his
preoccupation
what
is
the
matter
doctor
asked
the
comte
after
a
silence
the
matter
is
you
are
ill

and
have
had
no

the
doctor
knew
the
temper
of
that
mind
he
appreciated
the
strength
of
that
body
he
reflected
for
the
moment
told
himself
that
words
were
useless
remedies
absurd
and
left
the
chateau
exhorting
athoss
servants
not
to
quit
him
for
a
moment
the
doctor
being
gone
athos
evinced
neither
anger
nor
vexation
at
having
been
disturbed
he
did
not
even
desire
that
all
letters
that
came
should
be
brought
to
him
directly
he
knew
very
well
that
every
distraction
which
should
arise
would
be
a
joy
a
hope
which
his
servants
would
have
paid
with
their
blood
to
procure
him
sleep
had
become
rare
by
intense
thinking
athos
forgot
himself
for
a
few
hours
at
most
in
a
reverie
most
profound
more
obscure
than
other
people
would
have
called
a
dream
the
momentary
repose
which
this
forgetfulness
thus
gave
the
body
still
further
fatigued
the
soul
for
athos
lived
a
double
life
during
these
wanderings
of
his
understanding
one
night
he
dreamt
that
raoul
was
dressing
himself
in
a
tent
to
go
upon
an
expedition
commanded
by
m
de
beaufort
in
person
the
young
man
was
sad
he
clasped
his
cuirass
slowly
and
slowly
he
girded
on
his
sword
what
is
the

a

raoul
i
suffer
here
the
grief
you
soon
will
feel
at
home
and
the
vision
disappeared
with
the
slumber
of
athos
at
daybreak
one
of
his
servants
entered
his
masters
apartment
and
gave
him
a
letter
which
came
from

the

lines
oh
raoul
raoul
thanks
thou
keepest
thy
promise
thou
warnest
me
and

with
a
mortal
sweat

in

any

cause
than

vision
when
this
fainting
of
athos
had
ceased
the
comte
almost
ashamed
of
having
given
way
before
this
superior
natural
event
dressed
himself
and
ordered
his
horse
determined
to
ride
to
blois
to
open
more
certain
correspondences
with
either
africa
dartagnan
or
aramis
in
fact
this
letter
from
aramis
informed
the
comte
de
la
fere
of
the
bad
success
of
the
expedition
of
belleisle
it
gave
him
sufficient
details
of
the
death
of
porthos
to
move
the
tender
and
devoted
heart
of
athos
to
its
innermost
fibers
athos
wished
to
go
and
pay
his
friend
porthos
a
last
visit
to
render
this
honor
to
his
companion
in
arms
he
meant
to
send
to
dartagnan
to
prevail
upon
him
to
recommence
the
painful
voyage
to
belleisle
to
accomplish
in
his
company
that
sad
pilgrimage
to
the
tomb
of
the
giant
he
had
so
much
loved
then
to
return
to
his
dwelling
to
obey
that
secret
influence
which
was
conducting
him
to
eternity
by
a
mysterious
road
but
scarcely
had
his
joyous
servants
dressed
their
master
whom
they
saw
with
pleasure
preparing
for
a
journey
which
might
dissipate
his
melancholy
scarcely
had
the
comtes
gentlest
horse
been
saddled
and
brought
to
the
door
when
the
father
of
raoul
felt
his
head
become
confused
his
legs
give
way
and
he
clearly
perceived
the
impossibility
of
going
one
step
further
he
ordered
himself
to
be
carried
into
the
sun
they
laid
him
upon
his
bed
of
moss
where
he
passed
a
full
hour
before
he
could
recover
his
spirits
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
this
weakness
after
then
inert
repose
of
the
latter
days
athos
took
a
bouillon
to
give
him
strength
and
bathed
his
dried
lips
in
a
glassful
of
the
wine
he
loved
the
bestthat
old
anjou
wine
mentioned
by
porthos
in
his
admirable
will
then
refreshed
free
in
mind
he
had
his
horse
brought
again
but
only
with
the
aid
of
his
servants
was
he
able
painfully
to
climb
into
the
saddle
he
did
not
go
a
hundred
paces
a
shivering
seized
him
again
at
the
turning
of
the
road
this
is
very
strange
said
he
to
his
valet
de
chambre
who
accompanied
him
let
us
stop
monsieuri
conjure
you
replied
the
faithful
servant
how
pale
you
are
getting
that
will
not
prevent
my
pursuing
my
route
now
i
have
once
started
replied
the
comte
and
he
gave
his
horse
his
head
again
but
suddenly
the
animal
instead
of
obeying
the
thought
of
his
master
stopped
a
movement
of
which
athos
was
unconscious
had
checked
the
bit
something
said
athos
wills
that
i
should
go
no
further
support
me
added
he
stretching
out
his
arms
quick
come
closer
i
feel
my
muscles
relaxi
shall
fall
from
my
horse
the
valet
had
seen
the
movement
made
by
his
master
at
the
moment
he
received
the
order
he
went
up
to
him
quickly
received
the
comte
in
his
arms
and
as
they
were
not
yet
sufficiently
distant
from
the
house
for
the
servants
who
had
remained
at
the
door
to
watch
their
masters
departure
not
to
perceive
the
disorder
in
the
usually
regular
proceeding
of
the
comte
the
valet
called
his
comrades
by
gestures
and
voice
and
all
hastened
to
his
assistance
athos
had
gone
but
a
few
steps
on
his
return
when
he
felt
himself
better
again
his
strength
seemed
to
revive
and
with
it
the
desire
to
go
to
blois
he
made
his
horse
turn
round
but
at
the
animals
first
steps
he
sunk
again
into
a
state
of
torpor
and
anguish
well
decidedly
said
he
it
is
willed
that
i
should
stay
at
home
his
people
flocked
around
him
they
lifted
him
from
his
horse
and
carried
him
as
quickly
as
possible
into
the
house
everything
was
prepared
in
his
chamber
and
they
put
him
to
bed
you
will
be
sure
to
remember
said
he
disposing
himself
to
sleep
that
i
expect
letters
from
africa
this
very
day
monsieur
will
no
doubt
hear
with
pleasure
that
blaisoiss
son
is
gone
on
horseback
to
gain
an
hour
over
the
courier
of
blois
replied
his
valet
de
chambre
thank
you
replied
athos
with
his
placid
smile
the
comte
fell
asleep
but
his
disturbed
slumber
resembled
torture
rather
than
repose
the
servant
who
watched
him
saw
several
times
the
expression
of
internal
suffering
shadowed
on
his
features
perhaps
athos
was
dreaming
the
day
passed
away
blaisoiss
son
returned
the
courier
had
brought
no
news
the
comte
reckoned
the
minutes
with
despair
he
shuddered
when
those
minutes
made
an
hour
the
idea
that
he
was
forgotten
seized
him
once
and
brought
on
a
fearful
pang
of
the
heart
everybody
in
the
house
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
the
courierhis
hour
had
long
passed
four
times
the
express
sent
to
blois
had
repeated
his
journey
and
there
was
nothing
to
the
address
of
the
comte
athos
knew
that
the
courier
only
arrived
once
a
week
here
then
was
a
delay
of
eight
mortal
days
to
be
endured
he
commenced
the
night
in
this
painful
persuasion
all
that
a
sick
man
irritated
by
suffering
can
add
of
melancholy
suppositions
to
probabilities
already
gloomy
athos
heaped
up
during
the
early
hours
of
this
dismal
night
the
fever
rose
it
invaded
the
chest
where
the
fire
soon
caught
according
to
the
expression
of
the
physician
who
had
been
brought
back
from
blois
by
blaisois
at
his
last
journey
soon
it
gained
the
head
the
physician
made
two
successive
bleedings
which
dislodged
it
for
the
time
but
left
the
patient
very
weak
and
without
power
of
action
in
anything
but
his
brain
and
yet
this
redoubtable
fever
had
ceased
it
besieged
with
its
last
palpitations
the
tense
extremities
it
ended
by
yielding
as
midnight
struck
the
physician
seeing
the
incontestable
improvement
returned
to
blois
after
having
ordered
some
prescriptions
and
declared
that
the
comte
was
saved
then
commenced
for
athos
a
strange
indefinable
state
free
to
think
his
mind
turned
towards
raoul
that
beloved
son
his
imagination
penetrated
the
fields
of
africa
in
the
environs
of
gigelli
where
m
de
beaufort
must
have
landed
with
his
army
a
waste
of
gray
rocks
rendered
green
in
certain
parts
by
the
waters
of
the
sea
when
it
lashed
the
shore
in
storms
and
tempest
beyond
the
shore
strewed
over
with
these
rocks
like
gravestones
ascended
in
form
of
an
amphitheater
among
mastictrees
and
cactus
a
sort
of
small
town
full
of
smoke
confused
noises
and
terrified
movements
all
of
a
sudden
from
the
bosom
of
this
smoke
arose
a
flame
which
succeeded
creeping
along
the
houses
in
covering
the
entire
surface
of
the
town
and
increased
by
degrees
uniting
in
its
red
and
angry
vortices
tears
screams
and
supplicating
arms
outstretched
to
heaven
there
was
for
a
moment
a
frightful
pelemele
of
timbers
falling
to
pieces
of
swords
broken
of
stones
calcined
trees
burnt
and
disappearing
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
in
this
chaos
in
which
athos
distinguished
raised
arms
in
which
he
heard
cries
sobs
and
groans
he
did
not
see
one
human
figure
the
cannon
thundered
at
a
distance
musketry
madly
barked
the
sea
moaned
flocks
made
their
escape
bounding
over
the
verdant
slope
but
not
a
soldier
to
apply
the
match
to
the
batteries
of
cannon
not
a
sailor
to
assist
in
maneuvering
the
fleet
not
a
shepherd
in
charge
of
the
flocks
after
the
ruin
of
the
village
the
destruction
of
the
forts
which
dominated
it
a
ruin
and
destruction
magically
wrought
without
the
cooperation
of
a
single
human
being
the
flames
were
extinguished
the
smoke
began
to
subside
then
diminished
in
intensity
paled
and
disappeared
entirely
night
then
came
over
the
scene
night
dark
upon
the
earth
brilliant
in
the
firmament
the
large
blazing
stars
which
spangled
the
african
sky
glittered
and
gleamed
without
illuminating
anything
a
long
silence
ensued
which
gave
for
a
moment
repose
to
the
troubled
imagination
of
athos
and
as
he
felt
that
that
which
he
saw
was
not
terminated
he
applied
more
attentively
the
eyes
of
his
understanding
on
the
strange
spectacle
which
his
imagination
had
presented
this
spectacle
was
soon
continued
for
him
a
mild
pale
moon
rose
behind
the
declivities
of
the
coast
streaking
at
first
the
undulating
ripples
of
the
sea
which
appeared
to
have
calmed
after
the
roaring
it
had
sent
forth
during
the
vision
of
athosthe
moon
we
say
shed
its
diamonds
and
opals
upon
the
briers
and
bushes
of
the
hills
the
gray
rocks
so
many
silent
and
attentive
phantoms
appeared
to
raise
their
heads
to
examine
likewise
the
field
of
battle
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
athos
perceived
that
the
field
empty
during
the
combat
was
now
strewn
with
fallen
bodies
an
inexpressible
shudder
of
fear
and
horror
seized
his
soul
as
he
recognized
the
white
and
blue
uniforms
of
the
soldiers
of
picardy
with
their
long
pikes
and
blue
handles
and
muskets
marked
with
the
fleurdelis
on
the
butts
when
he
saw
all
the
gaping
wounds
looking
up
to
the
bright
heavens
as
if
to
demand
back
of
them
the
souls
to
which
they
had
opened
a
passagewhen
he
saw
the
slaughtered
horses
stiff
their
tongues
hanging
out
at
one
side
of
their
mouths
sleeping
in
the
shiny
blood
congealed
around
them
staining
their
furniture
and
their
maneswhen
he
saw
the
white
horse
of
m
de
beaufort
with
his
head
beaten
to
pieces
in
the
first
ranks
of
the
dead
athos
passed
a
cold
hand
over
his
brow
which
he
was
astonished
not
to
find
burning
he
was
convinced
by
this
touch
that
he
was
present
as
a
spectator
without
deliriums
dreadful
aid
the
day
after
the
battle
fought
upon
the
shores
of
gigelli
by
the
army
of
the
expedition
which
he
had
seen
leave
the
coast
of
france
and
disappear
upon
the
dim
horizon
and
of
which
he
had
saluted
with
thought
and
gesture
the
last
cannonshot
fired
by
the
duke
as
a
signal
of
farewell
to
his
country
who
can
paint
the
mortal
agony
with
which
his
soul
followed
like
a
vigilant
eye
these
effigies
of
claycold
soldiers
and
examined
them
one
after
the
other
to
see
if
raoul
slept
among
them
who
can
express
the
intoxication
of
joy
with
which
athos
bowed
before
god
and
thanked
him
for
not
having
seen
him
he
sought
with
so
much
fear
among
the
dead
in
fact
fallen
in
their
ranks
stiff
icy
the
dead
still
recognizable
with
ease
seemed
to
turn
with
complacency
towards
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
be
the
better
seen
by
him
during
his
sad
review
but
yet
he
was
astonished
while
viewing
all
these
bodies
not
to
perceive
the
survivors
to
such
a
point
did
the
illusion
extend
that
this
vision
was
for
him
a
real
voyage
made
by
the
father
into
africa
to
obtain
more
exact
information
respecting
his
son
fatigued
therefore
with
having
traversed
seas
and
continents
he
sought
repose
under
one
of
the
tents
sheltered
behind
a
rock
on
the
top
of
which
floated
the
white
fleurdelised
pennon
he
looked
for
a
soldier
to
conduct
him
to
the
tent
of
m
de
beaufort
then
while
his
eye
was
wandering
over
the
plain
turning
on
all
sides
he
saw
a
white
form
appear
behind
the
scented
myrtles
this
figure
was
clothed
in
the
costume
of
an
officer
it
held
in
its
hand
a
broken
sword
it
advanced
slowly
towards
athos
who
stopping
short
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
it
neither
spoke
nor
moved
but
wished
to
open
his
arms
because
in
this
silent
officer
he
had
already
recognized
raoul
the
comte
attempted
to
utter
a
cry
but
it
was
stifled
in
his
throat
raoul
with
a
gesture
directed
him
to
be
silent
placing
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
drawing
back
by
degrees
without
athos
being
able
to
see
his
legs
move
the
comte
still
paler
than
raoul
followed
his
son
painfully
traversing
briers
and
bushes
stones
and
ditches
raoul
not
appearing
to
touch
the
earth
no
obstacle
seeming
to
impede
the
lightness
of
his
march
the
comte
whom
the
inequalities
of
the
path
fatigued
soon
stopped
exhausted
raoul
still
continued
to
beckon
him
to
follow
him
the
tender
father
to
whom
love
restored
strength
made
a
last
effort
and
climbed
the
mountain
after
the
young
man
who
attracted
him
by
gesture
and
by
smile
at
length
he
gained
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
saw
thrown
out
in
black
upon
the
horizon
whitened
by
the
moon
the
aerial
form
of
raoul
athos
reached
forth
his
hand
to
get
closer
to
his
beloved
son
upon
the
plateau
and
the
latter
also
stretched
out
his
but
suddenly
as
if
the
young
man
had
been
drawn
away
in
his
own
despite
still
retreating
he
left
the
earth
and
athos
saw
the
clear
blue
sky
shine
between
the
feet
of
his
child
and
the
ground
of
the
hill
raoul
rose
insensibly
into
the
void
smiling
still
calling
with
gesturehe
departed
towards
heaven
athos
uttered
a
cry
of
tenderness
and
terror
he
looked
below
again
he
saw
a
camp
destroyed
and
all
those
white
bodies
of
the
royal
army
like
so
many
motionless
atoms
and
then
raising
his
head
he
saw
the
figure
of
his
son
still
beckoning
him
to
climb
the
mystic
void
chapter

the
angel
of
death
athos
was
at
this
part
of
his
marvelous
vision
when
the
charm
was
suddenly
broken
by
a
great
noise
rising
from
the
outer
gates
a
horse
was
heard
galloping
over
the
hard
gravel
of
the
great
alley
and
the
sound
of
noisy
and
animated
conversations
ascended
to
the
chamber
in
which
the
comte
was
dreaming
athos
did
not
stir
from
the
place
he
occupied
he
scarcely
turned
his
head
towards
the
door
to
ascertain
the
sooner
what
these
noises
could
be
a
heavy
step
ascended
the
stairs
the
horse
which
had
recently
galloped
departed
slowly
towards
the
stables
great
hesitation
appeared
in
the
steps
which
by
degrees
approached
the
chamber
a
door
was
opened
and
athos
turning
a
little
towards
the
part
of
the
room
the
noise
came
from
cried
in
a
weak
voice
it
is
a
courier
from
africa
is
it
not
no
monsieur
le
comte
replied
a
voice
which
made
the
father
of
raoul
start
upright
in
his
bed
grimaud
murmured
he
and
the
sweat
began
to
pour
down
his
face
grimaud
appeared
in
the
doorway
it
was
no
longer
the
grimaud
we
have
seen
still
young
with
courage
and
devotion
when
he
jumped
the
first
into
the
boat
destined
to
convey
raoul
de
bragelonne
to
the
vessels
of
the
royal
fleet
twas
now
a
stern
and
pale
old
man
his
clothes
covered
with
dust
and
hair
whitened
by
old
age
he
trembled
whilst
leaning
against
the
doorframe
and
was
near
falling
on
seeing
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
the
countenance
of
his
master
these
two
men
who
had
lived
so
long
together
in
a
community
of
intelligence
and
whose
eyes
accustomed
to
economize
expressions
knew
how
to
say
so
many
things
silentlythese
two
old
friends
one
as
noble
as
the
other
in
heart
if
they
were
unequal
in
fortune
and
birth
remained
tonguetied
whilst
looking
at
each
other
by
the
exchange
of
a
single
glance
they
had
just
read
to
the
bottom
of
each
others
hearts
the
old
servitor
bore
upon
his
countenance
the
impression
of
a
grief
already
old
the
outward
token
of
a
grim
familiarity
with
woe
he
appeared
to
have
no
longer
in
use
more
than
a
single
version
of
his
thoughts
as
formerly
he
was
accustomed
not
to
speak
much
he
was
now
accustomed
not
to
smile
at
all
athos
read
at
a
glance
all
these
shades
upon
the
visage
of
his
faithful
servant
and
in
the
same
tone
he
would
have
employed
to
speak
to
raoul
in
his
dream
grimaud
said
he
raoul
is
dead
is
it
not
so
behind
grimaud
the
other
servants
listened
breathlessly
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
bed
of
their
sick
master
they
heard
the
terrible
question
and
a
heartbreaking
silence
followed
yes
replied
the
old
man
heaving
the
monosyllable
from
his
chest
with
a
hoarse
broken
sigh
then
arose
voices
of
lamentation
which
groaned
without
measure
and
filled
with
regrets
and
prayers
the
chamber
where
the
agonized
father
sought
with
his
eyes
the
portrait
of
his
son
this
was
for
athos
like
the
transition
which
led
to
his
dream
without
uttering
a
cry
without
shedding
a
tear
patient
mild
resigned
as
a
martyr
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
heaven
in
order
there
to
see
again
rising
above
the
mountain
of
gigelli
the
beloved
shade
that
was
leaving
him
at
the
moment
of
grimauds
arrival
without
doubt
while
looking
towards
the
heavens
resuming
his
marvelous
dream
he
repassed
by
the
same
road
by
which
the
vision
at
once
so
terrible
and
sweet
had
led
him
before
for
after
having
gently
closed
his
eyes
he
reopened
them
and
began
to
smile
he
had
just
seen
raoul
who
had
smiled
upon
him
with
his
hands
joined
upon
his
breast
his
face
turned
towards
the
window
bathed
by
the
fresh
air
of
night
which
brought
upon
its
wings
the
aroma
of
the
flowers
and
the
woods
athos
entered
never
again
to
come
out
of
it
into
the
contemplation
of
that
paradise
which
the
living
never
see
god
willed
no
doubt
to
open
to
this
elect
the
treasures
of
eternal
beatitude
at
this
hour
when
other
men
tremble
with
the
idea
of
being
severely
received
by
the
lord
and
cling
to
this
life
they
know
in
the
dread
of
the
other
life
of
which
they
get
but
merest
glimpses
by
the
dismal
murky
torch
of
death
athos
was
spiritguided
by
the
pure
serene
soul
of
his
son
which
aspired
to
be
like
the
paternal
soul
everything
for
this
just
man
was
melody
and
perfume
in
the
rough
road
souls
take
to
return
to
the
celestial
country
after
an
hour
of
this
ecstasy
athos
softly
raised
his
hands
as
white
as
wax
the
smile
did
not
quit
his
lips
and
he
murmured
low
so
low
as
scarcely
to
be
audible
these
three
words
addressed
to
god
or
to
raoul
here
i
am
and
his
hands
fell
slowly
as
though
he
himself
had
laid
them
on
the
bed
death
had
been
kind
and
mild
to
this
noble
creature
it
had
spared
him
the
tortures
of
the
agony
convulsions
of
the
last
departure
had
opened
with
an
indulgent
finger
the
gates
of
eternity
to
that
noble
soul
god
had
no
doubt
ordered
it
thus
that
the
pious
remembrance
of
this
death
should
remain
in
the
hearts
of
those
present
and
in
the
memory
of
other
mena
death
which
caused
to
be
loved
the
passage
from
this
life
to
the
other
by
those
whose
existence
upon
this
earth
leads
them
not
to
dread
the
last
judgment
athos
preserved
even
in
the
eternal
sleep
that
placid
and
sincere
smilean
ornament
which
was
to
accompany
him
to
the
tomb
the
quietude
and
calm
of
his
fine
features
made
his
servants
for
a
long
time
doubt
whether
he
had
really
quitted

the
comtes

to
remove

who
from
a
distance
devoured
the
face
now
quickly
growing
marblepale
and
did
not
approach
from
pious
fear
of
bringing
to
him
the
breath
of
death
but
grimaud
fatigued
as
he
was
refused
to
leave
the
room
he
sat
himself
down
upon
the
threshold
watching
his
master
with
the
vigilance
of
a
sentinel
jealous
to
receive
either
his
first
waking
look
or
his
last
dying
sigh
the
noises
all
were
quiet
in
the
houseevery
one
respected
the
slumber
of
their
lord
but
grimaud
by
anxiously
listening
perceived
that
the
comte
no
longer
breathed
he
raised
himself
with
his
hands
leaning
on
the
ground
looked
to
see
if
there
did
not
appear
some
motion
in
the
body
of
his
master
nothing
fear
seized
him
he
rose
completely
up
and
at
the
very
moment
heard
some
one
coming
up
the
stairs
a
noise
of
spurs
knocking
against
a
sworda
warlike
sound
familiar
to
his
earsstopped
him
as
he
was
going
towards
the
bed
of
athos

voice
more
sonorous
than
brass
or
steel
resounded
within
three
paces
of
him

out

where

he
continued
the
musketeer
grimaud
seized
his
arm
in
his
bony
fingers
and
pointed
to
the
bed
upon
the
sheets
of
which
the
livid
tints
of
death
already
showed
a
choked
respiration
the
opposite
to
a
sharp
cry
swelled
the
throat
of
dartagnan
he
advanced
on
tiptoe
trembling
frightened
at
the
noise
his
feet
made
on
the
floor
his
heart
rent
by
a
nameless
agony
he
placed
his
ear
to
the
breast
of

his
face
to
the
comtes
mouth
neither
noise
nor
breath
dartagnan
drew
back
grimaud
who
had
followed
him
with
his
eyes
and
for
whom
each
of
his
movements
had
been
a
revelation
came
timidly
seated
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
glued
his
lips
to
the
sheet
which
was
raised
by
the
stiffened
feet
of
his
master
then
large
drops
began
to
flow
from
his
red
eyes
this
old
man
in
invincible
despair
who
wept
bent
doubled
without
uttering
a
word
presented
the
most
touching
spectacle
that
dartagnan
in
a
life
so
filled
with
emotion
had
ever
met
with
the
captain
resumed
standing
in
contemplation
before
that
smiling
dead
man
who
seemed
to
have
burnished
his
last
thought
to
give
his
best
friend
the
man
he
had
loved
next
to
raoul
a
gracious
welcome
even
beyond
life
and
for
reply
to
that
exalted
flattery
of
hospitality
dartagnan
went
and
kissed
athos
fervently
on
the
brow
and
with
his
trembling
fingers
closed
his
eyes
then
he
seated
himself
by
the
pillow
without
dread
of
that
dead
man
who
had
been
so
kind
and
affectionate
to
him
for
five
and
thirty
years
he
was
feeding
his
soul
with
the
remembrances
the
noble
visage
of
the
comte
brought
to
his
mind
in
crowdssome
blooming
and
charming
as
that
smilesome
dark
dismal
and
icy
as
that
visage
with
its
eyes
now
closed
to
all
eternity
all
at
once
the
bitter
flood
which
mounted
from
minute
to
minute
invaded
his
heart
and
swelled
his
breast
almost
to
bursting
incapable
of
mastering
his
emotion
he
arose
and
tearing
himself
violently
from
the
chamber
where
he
had
just
found
dead
him
to
whom
he
came
to
report
the
news
of
the
death
of
porthos
he
uttered
sobs
so
heartrending
that
the
servants
who
seemed
only
to
wait
for
an
explosion
of
grief
answered
to
it
by
their
lugubrious
clamors
and
the
dogs
of
the
late
comte
by
their
lamentable
howlings
grimaud
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
lift
up
his
voice
even
in
the
paroxysm
of
his
grief
he
would
not
have
dared
to
profane
the
dead
or
for
the
first
time
disturb
the
slumber
of

master

about

went
up
once
more
and
watching
the
moments
when
grimaud
turned
his
head
towards
him
he
made
him
a
sign
to
come
to
him
which
the
faithful
servant
obeyed
without
making
more
noise
than
a
shadow
dartagnan
went
down
again

by

had
gained
the
vestibule

the
old

the

of

the
regiments

and
advancing
against

rather
roughly
handled
there
was
a
sort
of
hesitation
in
our
troops
who
found
themselves
illseconded
by
the
artillery
in
fact
the
batteries
which
had
been
established
the
evening

a
weak
and
uncertain
aim
on
account
of
their
position
the
upward
direction
of
the
aim
lessened
the
justness
of
the
shots

well
as

range
monseigneur
comprehending
the
bad
effect
of
this
position
on
the
siege
artillery
commanded
the
frigates
moored
in
the
little
road
to
commence
a
regular
fire
against
the
place
m
de
bragelonne
offered
himself
at
once
to
carry
this
order
but
monseigneur
refused
to
acquiesce
in
the
vicomtes
request
monseigneur
was
right
for
he
loved
and
wished
to
spare
the
young
nobleman
he
was
quite
right
and
the
event
took
upon
itself
to
justify
his
foresight
and
refusal
for
scarcely
had
the
sergeant
charged
with
the
message
solicited
by
m
de
bragelonne
gained
the
seashore
when
two
shots
from
long
carbines
issued
from
the
enemys
ranks
and
laid
him
low
the
sergeant
fell
dyeing
the
sand
with
his
blood
observing
which
m
de
bragelonne
smiled
at
monseigneur
who
said
to
him
you
see
vicomte
i
have
saved
your
life
report
that
some
day
to
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
in
order
that
learning
it
from
you
he
may
thank
me
the
young
nobleman
smiled
sadly
and
replied
to
the
duke
it
is
true
monseigneur
that
but
for
your
kindness
i
should
have
been
killed
where
the
poor
sergeant
has
fallen
and
should
be
at
rest
m
de
bragelonne
made
this
reply
in
such
a
tone
that
monseigneur
answered
him
warmly
vrai
dieu
young
man
one
would
say
that
your
mouth
waters
for
death
but
by
the
soul
of
henry
iv
i
have
promised
your
father
to
bring
you
back
alive
and
please
the
lord
i
mean
to
keep
my
word
monseigneur
de
bragelonne
colored
and
replied
in
a
lower
voice
monseigneur
pardon
me
i
beseech
you
i
have
always
had
a
desire
to
meet
good
opportunities
and
it
is
so
delightful
to
distinguish
ourselves
before
our
general
particularly
when
that
general
is
m
le
duc
de
beaufort
monseigneur
was
a
little
softened
by
this
and
turning
to
the
officers
who
surrounded
him
gave
different
orders
the
grenadiers
of
the
two
regiments
got
near
enough
to
the
ditches
and
intrenchments
to
launch
their
grenades
which
had
but
small
effect
in
the
meanwhile
m
destrees
who
commanded
the
fleet
having
seen
the
attempt
of
the
sergeant
to
approach
the
vessels
understood
that
he
must
act
without
orders
and
opened
fire
then
the
arabs
finding
themselves
seriously
injured
by
the
balls
from
the
fleet
and
beholding
the
destruction
and
the
ruin
of
their
walls
uttered
the
most
fearful
cries
their
horsemen
descended
the
mountain
at
a
gallop
bent
over
their
saddles
and
rushed
full
tilt
upon
the
columns
of
infantry
which
crossing
their
pikes
stopped
this
mad
assault
repulsed
by
the
firm
attitude
of
the
battalion
the
arabs
threw
themselves
with
fury
towards
the
etatmajor
which
was
not
on
its
guard
at
that
moment
the
danger
was
great
monseigneur
drew
his
sword
his
secretaries
and
people
imitated
him
the
officers
of
the
suite
engaged
in
combat
with
the
furious
arabs
it
was
then
m
de
bragelonne
was
able
to
satisfy
the
inclination
he
had
so
clearly
shown
from
the
commencement
of
the
action
he
fought
near
the
prince
with
the
valor
of
a
roman
and
killed
three
arabs
with
his
small
sword
but
it
was
evident
that
his
bravery
did
not
arise
from
that
sentiment
of
pride
so
natural
to
all
who
fight
it
was
impetuous
affected
even
forced
he
sought
to
glut
intoxicate
himself
with
strife
and
carnage
he
excited
himself
to
such
a
degree
that
monseigneur
called
to
him
to
stop
he
must
have
heard
the
voice
of
monseigneur
because
we
who
were
close
to
him
heard
it
he
did
not
however
stop
but
continued
his
course
to
the
intrenchments
as
m
de
bragelonne
was
a
welldisciplined
officer
this
disobedience
to
the
orders
of
monseigneur
very
much
surprised
everybody
and
m
de
beaufort
redoubled
his
earnestness
crying
stop
bragelonne
where
are
you
going
stop
repeated
monseigneur
i
command
you
we
all
imitating
the
gesture
of
m
le
duc
we
all
raised
our
hands
we
expected
that
the
cavalier
would
turn
bridle
but
m
de
bragelonne
continued
to
ride
towards
the
palisades
stop
bragelonne
repeated
the
prince
in
a
very
loud
voice
stop
in
the
name
of
your
father
at
these
words
m
de
bragelonne
turned
round
his
countenance
expressed
a
lively
grief
but
he
did
not
stop
we
then
concluded
that
his
horse
must
have
run
away
with
him
when
m
le
duc
saw
cause
to
conclude
that
the
vicomte
was
no
longer
master
of
his
horse
and
had
watched
him
precede
the
first
grenadiers
his
highness
cried
musketeers
kill
his
horse
a
hundred
pistoles
for
the
man
who
kills
his
horse
but
who
could
expect
to
hit
the
beast
without
at
least
wounding
his
rider
no
one
dared
the
attempt
at
length
one
presented
himself
he
was
a
sharpshooter
of
the
regiment
of
picardy
named
luzerne
who
took
aim
at
the
animal
fired
and
hit
him
in
the
quarters
for
we
saw
the
blood
redden
the
hair
of
the
horse
instead
of
falling
the
cursed
jennet
was
irritated
and
carried
him
on
more
furiously
than
ever
every
picard
who
saw
this
unfortunate
young
man
rushing
on
to
meet
certain
death
shouted
in
the
loudest
manner
throw
yourself
off
monsieur
le
vicomteoffoff
throw
yourself
off
m
de
bragelonne
was
an
officer
much
beloved
in
the
army
already
had
the
vicomte
arrived
within
pistolshot
of
the
ramparts
when
a
discharge
was
poured
upon
him
that
enshrouded
him
in
fire
and
smoke
we
lost
sight
of
him
the
smoke
dispersed
he
was
on
foot
upright
his
horse
was
killed
the
vicomte
was
summoned
to
surrender
by
the
arabs
but
he
made
them
a
negative
sign
with
his
head
and
continued
to
march
towards
the
palisades
this
was
a
mortal
imprudence
nevertheless
the
entire
army
was
pleased
that
he
would
not
retreat
since
illchance
had
led
him
so
near
he
marched
a
few
paces
further
and
the
two
regiments
clapped
their
hands
it
was
at
this
moment
the
second
discharge
shook
the
walls
and
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
again
disappeared
in
the
smoke
but
this
time
the
smoke
dispersed
in
vain
we
no
longer
saw
him
standing
he
was
down
with
his
head
lower
than
his
legs
among
the
bushes
and
the
arabs
began
to
think
of
leaving
their
intrenchments
to
come
and
cut
off
his
head
or
take
his
bodyas
is
the
custom
with
the
infidels
but
monseigneur
le
duc
de
beaufort
had
followed
all
this
with
his
eyes
and
the
sad
spectacle
drew
from
him
many
painful
sighs
he
then
cried
aloud
seeing
the
arabs
running
like
white
phantoms
among
the
mastictrees
grenadiers
lancers
will
you
let
them
take
that
noble
body
saying
these
words
and
waving
his
sword
he
himself
rode
towards
the
enemy
the
regiments
rushing
in
his
steps
ran
in
their
turn
uttering
cries
as
terrible
as
those
of
the
arabs
were
wild
the
combat
commenced
over
the
body
of
m
de
bragelonne
and
with
such
inveteracy
was
it
fought
that
a
hundred
and
sixty
arabs
were
left
upon
the
field
by
the
side
of
at
least
fifty
of
our
troops
it
was
a
lieutenant
from
normandy
who
took
the
body
of
the
vicomte
on
his
shoulders
and
carried
it
back
to
the
lines
the
advantage
was
however
pursued
the
regiments
took
the
reserve
with
them
and
the
enemys
palisades
were
utterly
destroyed
at
three
oclock
the
fire
of
the
arabs
ceased
the
handtohand
fight
lasted
two
hours
it
was
a
massacre
at
five
oclock
we
were
victorious
at
all
points
the
enemy
had
abandoned
his
positions
and
m
le
duc
ordered
the
white
flag
to
be
planted
on
the
summit
of
the
little
mountain
it
was
then
we
had
time
to
think
of
m
de
bragelonne
who
had
eight
large
wounds
in
his
body
through
which
almost
all
his
blood
had
welled
away
still
however
he
had
breathed
which
afforded
inexpressible
joy
to
monseigneur
who
insisted
on
being
present
at
the
first
dressing
of
the
wounds
and
the
consultation
of
the
surgeons
there
were
two
among
them
who
declared
m
de
bragelonne
would
live
monseigneur
threw
his
arms
around
their
necks
and
promised
them
a
thousand
louis
each
if
they
could
save
him
the
vicomte
heard
these
transports
of
joy
and
whether
he
was
in
despair
or
whether
he
suffered
much
from
his
wounds
he
expressed
by
his
countenance
a
contradiction
which
gave
rise
to
reflection
particularly
in
one
of
the
secretaries
when
he
had
heard
what
follows
the
third
surgeon
was
the
brother
of
sylvain
de
saintcosme
the
most
learned
of
them
all
he
probed
the
wounds
in
his
turn
and
said
nothing
m
de
bragelonne
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
upon
the
skillful
surgeon
and
seemed
to
interrogate
his
every
movement
the
latter
upon
being
questioned
by
monseigneur
replied
that
he
saw
plainly
three
mortal
wounds
out
of
eight
but
so
strong
was
the
constitution
of
the
wounded
so
rich
was
he
in
youth
and
so
merciful
was
the
goodness
of
god
that
perhaps
m
de
bragelonne
might
recover
particularly
if
he
did
not
move
in
the
slightest
manner
frere
sylvain
added
turning
towards
his
assistants
above
everything
do
not
allow
him
to
move
even
a
finger
or
you
will
kill
him
and
we
all
left
the
tent
in
very
low
spirits
that
secretary
i
have
mentioned
on
leaving
the
tent
thought
he
perceived
a
faint
and
sad
smile
glide
over
the
lips
of
m
de
bragelonne
when
the
duke
said
to
him
in
a
cheerful
kind
voice
we
will
save
you
vicomte
we
will
save
you
yet
in
the
evening
when
it
was
believed
the
wounded
youth
had
taken
some
repose
one
of
the
assistants
entered
his
tent
but
rushed
out
again
immediately
uttering
loud
cries
we
all
ran
up
in
disorder
m
le
duc
with
us
and
the
assistant
pointed
to
the
body
of
m
de
bragelonne
upon
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
bathed
in
the
remainder
of
his
blood
it
appeared
that
he
had
suffered
some
convulsion
some
delirium
and
that
he
had
fallen
that
the
fall
had
accelerated
his
end
according
to
the
prognosis
of
frere
sylvain
we
raised
the
vicomte
he
was
cold
and
dead
he
held
a
lock
of
fair
hair
in
his
right
hand
and
that
hand
was
tightly
pressed
upon
his
heart
then
followed
the
details
of
the
expedition
and
of
the
victory
obtained
over
the
arabs
dartagnan
stopped
at
the
account
of
the
death
of
poor
raoul
oh
murmured
he
unhappy
boy
a
suicide
and
turning
his
eyes
towards
the
chamber
of
the
chateau
in
which
athos
slept
in
eternal
sleep
they
kept
their
words
with
each
other
said
he
in
a
low
voice
now
i
believe
them
to
be
happy
they
must
be
reunited
and
he
returned
through
the
parterre
with
slow
and
melancholy
steps
all
the
villageall
the
neighborhoodwere
filled
with
grieving
neighbors
relating
to
each
other
the
double
catastrophe
and
making
preparations
for
the
funeral
chapter
lx
the
last
canto
of
the
poem
on
the
morrow
all
the
noblesse
of
the
provinces
of
the
environs
and
wherever
messengers
had
carried
the
news
might
have
been
seen
arriving
in
detachments
dartagnan
had
shut
himself
up
without
being
willing
to
speak
to
anybody
two
such
heavy
deaths
falling
upon
the
captain
so
closely
after
the
death
of
porthos
for
a
long
time
oppressed
that
spirit
which
had
hitherto
been
so
indefatigable
and
invulnerable
except
grimaud
who
entered
his
chamber
once
the
musketeer
saw
neither
servants
nor
guests
he
supposed
from
the
noises
in
the
house
and
the
continual
coming
and
going
that
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
funeral
of
the
comte
he
wrote
to
the
king
to
ask
for
an
extension
of
his
leave
of
absence
grimaud
as
we
have
said
had
entered
dartagnans
apartment
had
seated
himself
upon
a
jointstool
near
the
door
like
a
man
who
meditates
profoundly
then
rising
he
made
a
sign
to
dartagnan
to
follow
him
the
latter
obeyed
in
silence
grimaud
descended
to
the
comtes
bedchamber
showed
the
captain
with
his
finger
the
place
of
the
empty
bed
and
raised
his
eyes
eloquently
towards
heaven
yes
replied
dartagnan
yes
good
grimaudnow
with
the
son
he
loved
so
much
grimaud
left
the
chamber
and
led
the
way
to
the
hall
where
according
to
the
custom
of
the
province
the
body
was
laid
out
previously
to
being
put
away
forever
dartagnan
was
struck
at
seeing
two
open
coffins
in
the
hall
in
reply
to
the
mute
invitation
of
grimaud
he
approached
and
saw
in
one
of
them
athos
still
handsome
in
death
and
in
the
other
raoul
with
his
eyes
closed
his
cheeks
pearly
as
those
of
the
palls
of
virgil
with
a
smile
on
his
violet
lips
he
shuddered
at
seeing
the
father
and
son
those
two
departed
souls
represented
on
earth
by
two
silent
melancholy
bodies
incapable
of
touching
each
other
however
close
they
might
be
raoul
here
murmured
he
oh
grimaud
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
grimaud
shook
his
head
and
made
no
reply
but
taking
dartagnan
by
the
hand
he
led
him
to
the
coffin
and
showed
him
under
the
thin
windingsheet
the
black
wounds
by
which
life
had
escaped
the
captain
turned
away
his
eyes
and
judging
it
was
useless
to
question
grimaud
who
would
not
answer
he
recollected
that
m
de
beauforts
secretary
had
written
more
than
he
dartagnan
had
had
the
courage
to
read
taking
up
the
recital
of
the
affair
which
had
cost
raoul
his
life
he
found
these
words
which
ended
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
letter
monseigneur
le
duc
has
ordered
that
the
body
of
monsieur
le
vicomte
should
be
embalmed
after
the
manner
practiced
by
the
arabs
when
they
wish
their
dead
to
be
carried
to
their
native
land
and
monsieur
le
duc
has
appointed
relays
so
that
the
same
confidential
servant
who
brought
up
the
young
man
might
take
back
his
remains
to
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
and
so
thought
dartagnan
i
shall
follow
thy
funeral
my
dear
boyi
already
oldi
who
am
of
no
value
on
earthand
i
shall
scatter
dust
upon
that
brow
i
kissed
but
two
months
since
god
has
willed
it
to
be
so
thou
hast
willed
it
to
be
so
thyself
i
have
no
longer
the
right
even
to
weep
thou
hast
chosen
death
it
seemed
to
thee
a
preferable
gift
to
life
at
length
arrived
the
moment
when
the
chill
remains
of
these
two
gentlemen
were
to
be
given
back
to
mother
earth
there
was
such
an
affluence
of
military
and
other
people
that
up
to
the
place
of
the
sepulture
which
was
a
little
chapel
on
the
plain
the
road
from
the
city
was
filled
with
horsemen
and
pedestrians
in
mourning
athos
had
chosen
for
his
restingplace
the
little
inclosure
of
a
chapel
erected
by
himself
near
the
boundary
of
his
estates
he
had
had
the
stones
cut
in
1550
brought
from
an
old
gothic
manorhouse
in
berry
which
had
sheltered
his
early
youth
the
chapel
thus
rebuilt
transported
was
pleasing
to
the
eye
beneath
its
leafy
curtains
of
poplars
and
sycamores
it
was
ministered
in
every
sunday
by
the
cure
of
the
neighboring
bourg
to
whom
athos
paid
an
allowance
of
two
hundred
francs
for
this
service
and
all
the
vassals
of
his
domain
with
their
families
came
thither
to
hear
mass
without
having
any
occasion
to
go
to
the
city
behind
the
chapel
extended
surrounded
by
two
high
hedges
of
hazel
elder
and
white
thorn
and
a
deep
ditch
the
little
inclosureuncultivated
though
gay
in
its
sterility
because
the
mosses
there
grew
thick
wild
heliotrope
and
ravenelles
there
mingled
perfumes
while
from
beneath
an
ancient
chestnut
issued
a
crystal
spring
a
prisoner
in
its
marble
cistern
and
on
the
thyme
all
around
alighted
thousands
of
bees
from
the
neighboring
plants
whilst
chaffinches
and
redthroats
sang
cheerfully
among
the
flowerspangled
hedges
it
was
to
this
place
the
somber
coffins
were
carried
attended
by
a
silent
and
respectful
crowd
the
office
of
the
dead
being
celebrated
the
last
adieux
paid
to
the
noble
departed
the
assembly
dispersed
talking
along
the
roads
of
the
virtues
and
mild
death
of
the
father
of
the
hopes
the
son
had
given
and
of
his
melancholy
end
upon
the
arid
coast
of
africa
little
by
little
all
noises
were
extinguished
like
the
lamps
illuminating
the
humble
nave
the
minister
bowed
for
the
last
time
to
the
altar
and
the
still
fresh
graves
then
followed
by
his
assistant
he
slowly
took
the
road
back
to
the
presbytery
dartagnan
left
alone
perceived
that
night
was
coming
on
he
had
forgotten
the
hour
thinking
only
of
the
dead
he
arose
from
the
oaken
bench
on
which
he
was
seated
in
the
chapel
and
wished
as
the
priest
had
done
to
go
and
bid
a
last
adieu
to
the
double
grave
which
contained
his
two
lost
friends
a
woman
was
praying
kneeling
on
the
moist
earth
dartagnan
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
to
avoid
disturbing
her
and
also
to
endeavor
to
find
out
who
was
the
pious
friend
who
performed
this
sacred
duty
with
so
much
zeal
and
perseverance
the
unknown
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands
which
were
white
as
alabaster
from
the
noble
simplicity
of
her
costume
she
must
be
a
woman
of
distinction
outside
the
inclosure
were
several
horses
mounted
by
servants
a
travelling
carriage
was
in
waiting
for
this
lady
dartagnan
in
vain
sought
to
make
out
what
caused
her
delay
she
continued
praying
and
frequently
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
by
which
dartagnan
perceived
she
was
weeping
he
beheld
her
strike
her
breast
with
the
compunction
of
a
christian
woman
he
heard
her
several
times
exclaim
as
from
a
wounded
heart
pardon
pardon
and
as
she
appeared
to
abandon
herself
entirely
to
her
grief
as
she
threw
herself
down
almost
fainting
exhausted
by
complaints
and
prayers
dartagnan
touched
by
this
love
for
his
so
much
regretted
friends
made
a
few
steps
towards
the
grave
in
order
to
interrupt
the
melancholy
colloquy
of
the
penitent
with
the
dead
but
as
soon
as
his
step
sounded
on
the
gravel
the
unknown
raised
her
head
revealing
to
dartagnan
a
face
aflood
with
tears
a
wellknown
face
it
was
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
monsieur
dartagnan
murmured
she
you
replied
the
captain
in
a
stern
voice
you
hereoh
madame
i
should
better
have
liked
to
see
you
decked
with
flowers
in
the
mansion
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
you
would
have
wept
lessand
they
tooand
i
monsieur
said
she
sobbing
for
it
was
you
added
this
pitiless
friend
of
the
deadit
was
you
who
sped
these
two
men
to
the
grave
oh
spare
me
god
forbid
madame
that
i
should
offend
a
woman
or
that
i
should
make
her
weep
in
vain
but
i
must
say
that
the
place
of
the
murderer
is
not
upon
the
grave
of
her
victims
she
wished
to
reply
what
i
now
tell
you
added
he
coldly
i
have
already
told
the
king
she
clasped
her
hands
i
know
said
she
i
have
caused
the
death
of
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
ah
you
know
it
the
news
arrived
at
court
yesterday
i
have
traveled
during
the
night
forty
leagues
to
come
and
ask
pardon
of
the
comte
whom
i
supposed
to
be
still
living
and
to
pray
god
on
the
tomb
of
raoul
that
he
would
send
me
all
the
misfortunes
i
have
merited
except
a
single
one
now
monsieur
i
know
that
the
death
of
the
son
has
killed
the
father
i
have
two
crimes
to
reproach
myself
with
i
have
two
punishments
to
expect
from
heaven
i
will
repeat
to
you
mademoiselle
said
dartagnan
what
m
de
bragelonne
said
of
you
at
antibes
when
he
already
meditated
death
if
pride
and
coquetry
have
misled
her
i
pardon
her
while
despising
her
if
love
has
produced
her
error
i
pardon
her
but
i
swear
that
no
one
could
have
loved
her
as
i
have
done
you
know
interrupted
louise
that
of
my
love
i
was
about
to
sacrifice
myself
you
know
whether
i
suffered
when
you
met
me
lost
dying
abandoned
well
never
have
i
suffered
so
much
as
now
because
then
i
hoped
desirednow
i
have
no
longer
anything
to
wish
for
because
this
death
drags
all
my
joy
into
the
tomb
because
i
can
no
longer
dare
to
love
without
remorse
and
i
feel
that
he
whom
i
loveoh
it
is
but
justwill
repay
me
with
the
tortures
i
have
made
others
undergo
dartagnan
made
no
reply
he
was
too
well
convinced
that
she
was
not
mistaken
well
then
added
she
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
do
not
overwhelm
me
today
i
again
implore
you
i
am
like
the
branch
torn
from
the
trunk
i
no
longer
hold
to
anything
in
this
worlda
current
drags
me
on
i
know
not
whither
i
love
madly
even
to
the
point
of
coming
to
tell
it
wretch
that
i
am
over
the
ashes
of
the
dead
and
i
do
not
blush
for
iti
have
no
remorse
on
this
account
such
love
is
a
religion
only
as
hereafter
you
will
see
me
alone
forgotten
disdained
as
you
will
see
me
punished
as
i
am
destined
to
be
punished
spare
me
in
my
ephemeral
happiness
leave
it
to
me
for
a
few
days
for
a
few
minutes
now
even
at
the
moment
i
am
speaking
to
you
perhaps
it
no
longer
exists
my
god
this
double
murder
is
perhaps
already
expiated
while
she
was
speaking
thus
the
sound
of
voices
and
of
horses
drew
the
attention
of
the
captain
m
de
saintaignan
came
to
seek
la
valliere
the
king
he
said
is
a
prey
to
jealousy
and
uneasiness
saintaignan
did
not
perceive
dartagnan
half
concealed
by
the
trunk
of
a
chestnuttree
which
shaded
the
double
grave
louise
thanked
saintaignan
and
dismissed
him
with
a
gesture
he
rejoined
the
party
outside
the
inclosure
you
see
madame
said
the
captain
bitterly
to
the
young
womanyou
see
your
happiness
still
lasts
the
young
woman
raised
her
head
with
a
solemn
air
a
day
will
come
said
she
when
you
will
repent
of
having
so
misjudged
me
on
that
day
it
is
i
who
will
pray
god
to
forgive
you
for
having
been
unjust
towards
me
besides
i
shall
suffer
so
much
that
you
yourself
will
be
the
first
to
pity
my
sufferings
do
not
reproach
me
with
my
fleeting
happiness
monsieur
dartagnan
it
costs
me
dear
and
i
have
not
paid
all
my
debt
saying
these
words
she
again
knelt
down
softly
and
affectionately
pardon
me
the
last
time
my
affianced
raoul
said
she
i
have
broken
our
chain
we
are
both
destined
to
die
of
grief
it
is
thou
who
departest
first
fear
nothing
i
shall
follow
thee
see
only
that
i
have
not
been
base
and
that
i
have
come
to
bid
thee
this
last
adieu
the
lord
is
my
witness
raoul
that
if
with
my
life
i
could
have
redeemed
thine
i
would
have
given
that
life
without
hesitation
i
could
not
give
my
love
once
more
forgive
me
dearest
kindest
friend
she
strewed
a
few
sweet
flowers
on
the
freshly
sodded
earth
then
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
the
heavily
stricken
lady
bowed
to
dartagnan
and
disappeared
the
captain
watched
the
departure
of
the
horses
horsemen
and
carriage
then
crossing
his
arms
upon
his
swelling
chest
when
will
it
be
my
turn
to
depart
said
he
in
an
agitated
voice
what
is
there
left
for
man
after
youth
love
glory
friendship
strength
and

who

he
hesitated
for
a
moment
with
a
dull
eye
then
drawing
himself
up
forward
still
forward
said
he
when
it
is

will
tell
me
as

epilogue
four
years
after
the
scene
we
have
just
described
two
horsemen
well
mounted
traversed
blois
early
in
the
morning
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
a
hawking
party
the
king
had
arranged
to
make
in
that
uneven
plain
the
loire
divides
in
two
which
borders
on
the
one
side
meung
on
the
other
amboise
these
were
the
keeper
of
the
kings
harriers
and
the
master
of
the
falcons
personages
greatly
respected
in
the
time
of
louis
xiii
but
rather
neglected
by
his
successor
the
horsemen
having
reconnoitered
the
ground
were
returning
their
observations
made
when
they
perceived
certain
little
groups
of
soldiers
here
and
there
whom
the
sergeants
were
placing
at
distances
at
the
openings
of
the
inclosures
these
were
the
kings
musketeers
behind
them
came
upon
a
splendid
horse
the
captain
known
by
his
richly
embroidered
uniform
his
hair
was
gray
his
beard
turning
so
he
seemed
a
little
bent
although
sitting
and
handling
his
horse
gracefully
he
was
looking
about
him
watchfully
m
dartagnan
does
not
get
any
older
said
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
to
his
colleague
the
falconer
with
ten
years
more
to
carry
than
either
of
us
he
has
the
seat
of
a
young
man
on
horseback
that
is
true
replied
the
falconer
i
dont
see
any
change
in
him
for
the
last
twenty
years
but
this
officer
was
mistaken
dartagnan
in
the
last
four
years
had
lived
a
dozen
age
had
printed
its
pitiless
claws
at
each
angle
of
his
eyes
his
brow
was
bald
his
hands
formerly
brown
and
nervous
were
getting
white
as
if
the
blood
had
half
forgotten
them
dartagnan
accosted
the
officers
with
the
shade
of
affability
which
distinguishes
superiors
and
received
in
turn
for
his
courtesy
two
most
respectful
bows
ah
what
a
lucky
chance
to
see
you
here
monsieur
dartagnan
cried
the
falconer
it
is
rather
i
who
should
say
that
messieurs
replied
the
captain
for
nowadays
the
king
makes
more
frequent
use
of
his
musketeers
than
of
his
falcons
ah
it
is
not
as
it
was
in
the
good
old
times
sighed
the
falconer
do
you
remember
monsieur
dartagnan
when
the
late
king
flew
the
pie
in
the
vineyards
beyond
beaugence
ah
dame
you
were
not
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
at
that
time
monsieur
dartagnan
7
and
you
were
nothing
but
undercorporal
of
the
tiercelets
replied
dartagnan
laughing
never
mind
that
it
was
a
good
time
seeing
that
it
is
always
a
good
time
when
we
are
young
good
day
monsieur
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
you
do
me
honor
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
latter
dartagnan
made
no
reply
the
title
of
comte
had
hardly
struck
him
dartagnan
had
been
a
comte
four
years
are
you
not
very
much
fatigued
with
the
long
journey
you
have
taken
monsieur
le
capitaine
continued
the
falconer
it
must
be
full
two
hundred
leagues
from
hence
to
pignerol
two
hundred
and
sixty
to
go
and
as
many
to
return
said
dartagnan
quietly
and
said
the
falconer
is
he
well
who
asked
dartagnan
why
poor
m
fouquet
continued
the
falconer
in
a
low
voice
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
had
prudently
withdrawn
no
replied
dartagnan
the
poor
man
frets
terribly
he
cannot
comprehend
how
imprisonment
can
be
a
favor
he
says
that
parliament
absolved
him
by
banishing
him
and
banishment
is
or
should
be
liberty
he
cannot
imagine
that
they
had
sworn
his
death
and
that
to
save
his
life
from
the
claws
of
parliament
was
to
be
under
too
much
obligation
to
heaven
ah
yes
the
poor
man
had
a
close
chance
of
the
scaffold
replied
the
falconer
it
is
said
that
m
colbert
had
given
orders
to
the
governor
of
the
bastile
and
that
the
execution
was
ordered
enough
said
dartagnan
pensively
and
with
a
view
of
cutting
short
the
conversation
yes
said
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
drawing
towards
them
m
fouquet
is
now
at
pignerol
he
has
richly
deserved
it
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
conducted
there
by
you
he
robbed
the
king
sufficiently
dartagnan
launched
at
the
master
of
the
dogs
one
of
his
crossest
looks
and
said
to
him
monsieur
if
any
one
told
me
you
had
eaten
your
dogs
meat
not
only
would
i
refuse
to
believe
it
but
still
more
if
you
were
condemned
to
the
lash
or
to
jail
for
it
i
should
pity
you
and
would
not
allow
people
to
speak
ill
of
you
and
yet
monsieur
honest
man
as
you
may
be
i
assure
you
that
you
are
not
more
so
than
poor
m
fouquet
was
after
having
undergone
this
sharp
rebuke
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
hung
his
head
and
allowed
the
falconer
to
get
two
steps
in
advance
of
him
nearer
to
dartagnan
he
is
content
said
the
falconer
in
a
low
voice
to
the
musketeer
we
all
know
that
harriers
are
in
fashion
nowadays
if
he
were
a
falconer
he
would
not
talk
in
that
way
dartagnan
smiled
in
a
melancholy
manner
at
seeing
this
great
political
question
resolved
by
the
discontent
of
such
humble
interest
he
for
a
moment
ran
over
in
his
mind
the
glorious
existence
of
the
surintendant
the
crumbling
of
his
fortunes
and
the
melancholy
death
that
awaited
him
and
to
conclude
did
m
fouquet
love
falconry
said
he
oh
passionately
monsieur
repeated
the
falconer
with
an
accent
of
bitter
regret
and
a
sigh
that
was
the
funeral
oration
of
fouquet
dartagnan
allowed
the
illhumor
of
the
one
and
the
regret
of
the
other
to
pass
and
continued
to
advance
they
could
already
catch
glimpses
of
the
huntsmen
at
the
issue
of
the
wood
the
feathers
of
the
outriders
passing
like
shooting
stars
across
the
clearings
and
the
white
horses
skirting
the
bosky
thickets
looking
like
illuminated
apparitions
but
resumed
dartagnan
will
the
sport
last
long
pray
give
us
a
good
swift
bird
for
i
am
very
tired
is
it
a
heron
or
a
swan
both
monsieur
dartagnan
said
the
falconer
but
you
need
not
be
alarmed
the
king
is
not
much
of
a
sportsman
he
does
not
take
the
field
on
his
own
account
he
only
wishes
to
amuse
the
ladies
the
words
to
amuse
the
ladies
were
so
strongly
accented
they
set
dartagnan
thinking
ah
said
he
looking
keenly
at
the
falconer
the
keeper
of
the
harriers
smiled
no
doubt
with
a
view
of
making
it
up
with
the
musketeer
oh
you
may
safely
laugh
said
dartagnan
i
know
nothing
of
current
news
i
only
arrived
yesterday
after
a
months
absence
i
left
the
court
mourning
the
death
of
the
queenmother
the
king
was
not
willing
to
take
any
amusement
after
receiving
the
last
sigh
of
anne
of
austria
but
everything
comes
to
an
end
in
this
world
well
then
he
is
no
longer
sad
so
much
the
better
8
and
everything
begins
as
well
as
ends
said
the
keeper
with
a
coarse
laugh
ah
said
dartagnan
a
second
timehe
burned
to
know
but
dignity
would
not
allow
him
to
interrogate
people
below
himthere
is
something
beginning
then
it
seems
the
keeper
gave
him
a
significant
wink
but
dartagnan
was
unwilling
to
learn
anything
from
this
man
shall
we
see
the
king
early
asked
he
of
the
falconer
at
seven
oclock
monsieur
i
shall
fly
the
birds
who
comes
with
the
king
how
is
madame
how
is
the
queen
better
monsieur
has
she
been
ill
then
monsieur
since
the
last
chagrin
she
suffered
her
majesty
has
been
unwell
what
chagrin
you
need
not
fancy
your
news
is
old
i
have
but
just
returned
it
appears
that
the
queen
a
little
neglected
since
the
death
of
her
motherinlaw
complained
to
the
king
who
answered
herdo
i
not
sleep
at
home
every
night
madame
what
more
do
you
expect
ah
said
dartagnanpoor
woman
she
must
heartily
hate
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
oh
no
not
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
replied
the
falconer
who
then
the
blast
of
a
huntinghorn
interrupted
this
conversation
it
summoned
the
dogs
and
the
hawks
the
falconer
and
his
companions
set
off
immediately
leaving
dartagnan
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
suspended
sentence
the
king
appeared
at
a
distance
surrounded
by
ladies
and
horsemen
all
the
troop
advanced
in
beautiful
order
at
a
foots
pace
the
horns
of
various
sorts
animating
the
dogs
and
horses
there
was
an
animation
in
the
scene
a
mirage
of
light
of
which
nothing
now
can
give
an
idea
unless
it
be
the
fictitious
splendor
of
a
theatric
spectacle
dartagnan
with
an
eye
a
little
just
a
little
dimmed
by
age
distinguished
behind
the
group
three
carriages
the
first
was
intended
for
the
queen
it
was
empty
dartagnan
who
did
not
see
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
by
the
kings
side
on
looking
about
for
her
saw
her
in
the
second
carriage
she
was
alone
with
two
of
her
women
who
seemed
as
dull
as
their
mistress
on
the
left
hand
of
the
king
upon
a
highspirited
horse
restrained
by
a
bold
and
skillful
hand
shone
a
lady
of
most
dazzling
beauty
the
king
smiled
upon
her
and
she
smiled
upon
the
king
loud
laughter
followed
every
word
she
uttered
i
must
know
that
woman
thought
the
musketeer
who
can
she
be
and
he
stooped
towards
his
friend
the
falconer
to
whom
he
addressed
the
question
he
had
put
to
himself
the
falconer
was
about
to
reply
when
the
king
perceiving
dartagnan
ah
comte
said
he
you
are
amongst
us
once
more
then
why
have
i
not
seen
you
sire
replied
the
captain
because
your
majesty
was
asleep
when
i
arrived
and
not
awake
when
i
resumed
my
duties
this
morning
still
the
same
said
louis
in
a
loud
voice
denoting
satisfaction
take
some
rest
comte
i
command
you
to
do
so
you
will
dine
with
me
today
a
murmur
of
admiration
surrounded
dartagnan
like
a
caress
every
one
was
eager
to
salute
him
dining
with
the
king
was
an
honor
his
majesty
was
not
so
prodigal
of
as
henry
iv
had
been
the
king
passed
a
few
steps
in
advance
and
dartagnan
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
fresh
group
among
whom
shone
colbert
goodday
monsieur
dartagnan
said
the
minister
with
marked
affability
have
you
had
a
pleasant
journey
yes
monsieur
said
dartagnan
bowing
to
the
neck
of
his
horse
i
heard
the
king
invite
you
to
his
table
for
this
evening
continued
the
minister
you
will
meet
an
old
friend
there
an
old
friend
of
mine
asked
dartagnan
plunging
painfully
into
the
dark
waves
of
the
past
which
had
swallowed
up
for
him
so
many
friendships
and
so
many
hatreds
m
le
duc
dalmeda
who
is
arrived
this
morning
from
spain
the
duc
dalmeda
said
dartagnan
reflecting
in
vain
here
cried
an
old
man
white
as
snow
sitting
bent
in
his
carriage
which
he
caused
to
be
thrown
open
to
make
room
for
the
musketeer
aramis
cried
dartagnan
struck
with
profound
amazement
and
he
felt
inert
as
it
was
the
thin
arm
of
the
old
nobleman
hanging
round
his
neck
colbert
after
having
observed
them
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
urged
his
horse
forward
and
left
the
two
old
friends
together
and
so
said
the
musketeer
taking
aramiss
arm
you
the
exile
the
rebel
are
again
in
france
ah
and
i
shall
dine
with
you
at
the
kings
table
said
aramis
smiling
yes
will
you
not
ask
yourself
what
is
the
use
of
fidelity
in
this
world
stop
let
us
allow
poor
la
vallieres
carriage
to
pass
look
how
uneasy
she
is
how
her
eyes
dim
with
tears
follow
the
king
who
is
riding
on
horseback
yonder
with
whom
with
mademoiselle
de
tonnaycharente
now
madame
de
montespan
replied
aramis
she
is
jealous
is
she
then
deserted
not
quite
yet
but
it
will
not
be
long
before
she
is
9
they
chatted
together
while
following
the
sport
and
aramiss
coachman
drove
them
so
cleverly
that
they
arrived
at
the
instant
when
the
falcon
attacking
the
bird
beat
him
down
and
fell
upon
him
the
king
alighted
madame
de
montespan
followed
his
example
they
were
in
front
of
an
isolated
chapel
concealed
by
huge
trees
already
despoiled
of
their
leaves
by
the
first
cutting
winds
of
autumn
behind
this
chapel
was
an
inclosure
closed
by
a
latticed
gate
the
falcon
had
beaten
down
his
prey
in
the
inclosure
belonging
to
this
little
chapel
and
the
king
was
desirous
of
going
in
to
take
the
first
feather
according
to
custom
the
cortege
formed
a
circle
round
the
building
and
the
hedges
too
small
to
receive
so
many
dartagnan
held
back
aramis
by
the
arm
as
he
was
about
like
the
rest
to
alight
from
his
carriage
and
in
a
hoarse
broken
voice
do
you
know
aramis
said
he
whither
chance
has
conducted
us
no
replied
the
duke
here
repose
men
that
we
knew
well
said
dartagnan
greatly
agitated
aramis
without
divining
anything
and
with
a
trembling
step
penetrated
into
the
chapel
by
a
little
door
which
dartagnan
opened
for
him
where
are
they
buried
said
he
there
in
the
inclosure
there
is
a
cross
you
see
beneath
yon
little
cypress
the
tree
of
grief
is
planted
over
their
tomb
dont
go
to
it
the
king
is
going
that
way
the
heron
has
fallen
just
there
aramis
stopped
and
concealed
himself
in
the
shade
they
then
saw
without
being
seen
the
pale
face
of
la
valliere
who
neglected
in
her
carriage
at
first
looked
on
with
a
melancholy
heart
from
the
door
and
then
carried
away
by
jealousy
advanced
into
the
chapel
whence
leaning
against
a
pillar
she
contemplated
the
king
smiling
and
making
signs
to
madame
de
montespan
to
approach
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
madame
de
montespan
complied
she
took
the
hand
the
king
held
out
to
her
and
he
plucking
out
the
first
feather
from
the
heron
which
the
falconer
had
strangled
placed
it
in
his
beautiful
companions
hat
she
smiling
in
her
turn
kissed
the
hand
tenderly
which
made
her
this
present
the
king
grew
scarlet
with
vanity
and
pleasure
he
looked
at
madame
de
montespan
with
all
the
fire
of
new
love
what
will
you
give
me
in
exchange
said
he
she
broke
off
a
little
branch
of
cypress
and
offered
it
to
the
king
who
looked
intoxicated
with
hope
humph
said
aramis
to
dartagnan
the
present
is
but
a
sad
one
for
that
cypress
shades
a
tomb
yes
and
the
tomb
is
that
of
raoul
de
bragelonne
said
dartagnan
aloud
of
raoul
who
sleeps
under
that
cross
with
his
father
a
groan
resoundedthey
saw
a
woman
fall
fainting
to
the
ground
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
seen
all
heard
all
poor
woman
muttered
dartagnan
as
he
helped
the
attendants
to
carry
back
to
her
carriage
the
lonely
lady
whose
lot
henceforth
in
life
was
suffering
that
evening
dartagnan
was
seated
at
the
kings
table
near
m
colbert
and
m
le
duc
dalmeda
the
king
was
very
gay
he
paid
a
thousand
little
attentions
to
the
queen
a
thousand
kindnesses
to
madame
seated
at
his
left
hand
and
very
sad
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
time
of
calm
when
the
king
was
wont
to
watch
his
mothers
eyes
for
the
approval
or
disapproval
of
what
he
had
just
done
of
mistresses
there
was
no
question
at
this
dinner
the
king
addressed
aramis
two
or
three
times
calling
him
m
lambassadeur
which
increased
the
surprise
already
felt
by
dartagnan
at
seeing
his
friend
the
rebel
so
marvelously
well
received
at
court
the
king
on
rising
from
table
gave
his
hand
to
the
queen
and
made
a
sign
to
colbert
whose
eye
was
on
his
masters
face
colbert
took
dartagnan
and
aramis
on
one
side
the
king
began
to
chat
with
his
sister
whilst
monsieur
very
uneasy
entertained
the
queen
with
a
preoccupied
air
without
ceasing
to
watch
his
wife
and
brother
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
conversation
between
aramis
dartagnan
and
colbert
turned
upon
indifferent
subjects
they
spoke
of
preceding
ministers
colbert
related
the
successful
tricks
of
mazarin
and
desired
those
of
richelieu
to
be
related
to
him
dartagnan
could
not
overcome
his
surprise
at
finding
this
man
with
his
heavy
eyebrows
and
low
forehead
display
so
much
sound
knowledge
and
cheerful
spirits
aramis
was
astonished
at
that
lightness
of
character
which
permitted
this
serious
man
to
retard
with
advantage
the
moment
for
more
important
conversation
to
which
nobody
made
any
allusion
although
all
three
interlocutors
felt
its
imminence
it
was
very
plain
from
the
embarrassed
appearance
of
monsieur
how
much
the
conversation
of
the
king
and
madame
annoyed
him
madames
eyes
were
almost
red
was
she
going
to
complain
was
she
going
to
expose
a
little
scandal
in
open
court
the
king
took
her
on
one
side
and
in
a
tone
so
tender
that
it
must
have
reminded
the
princess
of
the
time
when
she
was
loved
for
herself
sister
said
he
why
do
i
see
tears
in
those
lovely
eyes
whysire
said
she
monsieur
is
jealous
is
he
not
sister
she
looked
towards
monsieur
an
infallible
sign
that
they
were
talking
about
him
yes
said
she
listen
to
me
said
the
king
if
your
friends
compromise
you
it
is
not
monsieurs
fault
he
spoke
these
words
with
so
much
kindness
that
madame
encouraged
having
borne
so
many
solitary
griefs
so
long
was
nearly
bursting
into
tears
so
full
was
her
heart
come
come
dear
little
sister
said
the
king
tell
me
your
griefs
on
the
word
of
a
brother
i
pity
them
on
the
word
of
a
king
i
will
put
an
end
to
them
she
raised
her
glorious
eyes
and
in
a
melancholy
tone
it
is
not
my
friends
who
compromise
me
said
she
they
are
either
absent
or
concealed
they
have
been
brought
into
disgrace
with
your
majesty
they
so
devoted
so
good
so
loyal
you
say
this
on
account
of
de
guiche
whom
i
have
exiled
at
monsieurs
desire
and
who
since
that
unjust
exile
has
endeavored
to
get
himself
killed
once
every
day
unjust
say
you
sister
so
unjust
that
if
i
had
not
had
the
respect
mixed
with
friendship
that
i
have
always
entertained
for
your
majesty
well
well
i
would
have
asked
my
brother
charles
upon
whom
i
can
always
the
king
started
what
then
i
would
have
asked
him
to
have
had
it
represented
to
you
that
monsieur
and
his
favorite
m
le
chevalier
de
lorraine
ought
not
with
impunity
to
constitute
themselves
the
executioners
of
my
honor
and
my
happiness
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
said
the
king
that
dismal
fellow
is
my
mortal
enemy
whilst
that
man
lives
in
my
household
where
monsieur
retains
him
and
delegates
his
power
to
him
i
shall
be
the
most
miserable
woman
in
the
kingdom
so
said
the
king
slowly
you
call
your
brother
of
england
a
better
friend
than
i
am
actions
speak
for
themselves
sire
and
you
would
prefer
going
to
ask
assistance
there
to
my
own
country
said
she
with
pride
yes
sire
you
are
the
grandchild
of
henry
iv
as
well
as
myself
lady
cousin
and
brotherinlaw
does
not
that
amount
pretty
well
to
the
title
of
brothergermain
then
said
henrietta
act
let
us
form
an
alliance
begin
i
have
you
say
unjustly
exiled
de
guiche
oh
yes
said
she
blushing
de
guiche
shall
return
10
so
far
well
and
now
you
say
that
i
do
wrong
in
having
in
your
household
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
who
gives
monsieur
ill
advice
respecting
you
remember
well
what
i
tell
you
sire
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
some
dayobserve
if
ever
i
come
to
a
dreadful
end
i
beforehand
accuse
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
he
has
a
spirit
that
is
capable
of
any
crime
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
shall
no
longer
annoy
youi
promise
you
that
11
then
that
will
be
a
true
preliminary
of
alliance
sirei
sign
but
since
you
have
done
your
part
tell
me
what
shall
be
mine
instead
of
embroiling
me
with
your
brother
charles
you
must
make
him
a
more
intimate
friend
than
ever
that
is
very
easy
oh
not
quite
so
easy
as
you
may
suppose
for
in
ordinary
friendship
people
embrace
or
exercise
hospitality
and
that
only
costs
a
kiss
or
a
return
profitable
expenses
but
in
political
friendship
ah
its
a
political
friendship
is
it
yes
my
sister
and
then
instead
of
embraces
and
feasts
it
is
soldiersit
is
soldiers
all
alive
and
well
equippedthat
we
must
serve
up
to
our
friends
vessels
we
must
offer
all
armed
with
cannons
and
stored
with
provisions
it
hence
results
that
we
have
not
always
coffers
in
a
fit
condition
for
such
friendships
ah
you
are
quite
right
said
madame
the
coffers
of
the
king
of
england
have
been
sonorous
for
some
time
but
you
my
sister
who
have
so
much
influence
over
your
brother
you
can
secure
more
than
an
ambassador
could
ever
get
the
promise
of
to
effect
that
i
must
go
to
london
my
dear
brother
i
have
thought
so
replied
the
king
eagerly
and
i
have
said
to
myself
that
such
a
voyage
would
do
your
health
and
spirits
good
only
interrupted
madame
it
is
possible
i
should
fail
the
king
of
england
has
dangerous
counselors
counselors
do
you
say
precisely
if
by
chance
your
majesty
had
any
intentioni
am
only
supposing
soof
asking
charles
ii
his
alliance
in
a
war
a
war
yes
well
then
the
kings
counselors
who
are
in
number
sevenmademoiselle
stewart
mademoiselle

mademoiselle
gwyn
miss
orchay
mademoiselle
zunga
miss
davies
and
the
proud
countess
of
castlemainewill
represent
to
the
king
that
war
costs
a
great
deal
of
money
that
it
is
better
to
give
balls
and
suppers
at
hampton
court
than
to
equip
ships
of
the
line
at
portsmouth
and
greenwich
and
then
your
negotiations
will
fail
oh
those
ladies
cause
all
negotiations
to
fall
through
which
they
dont
make
themselves
do
you
know
the
idea
that
has
struck
me
sister
no
inform
me
what
it
is
it
is
that
searching
well
around
you
you
might
perhaps
find
a
female
counselor
to
take
with
you
to
your
brother
whose
eloquence
might
paralyze
the
illwill
of
the
seven
others
that
is
really
an
idea
sire
and
i
will
search
you
will
find
what
you
want
i
hope
so
a
pretty
ambassadress
is
necessary
an
agreeable
face
is
better
than
an
ugly
one
is
it
not
most
assuredly
an
animated
lively
audacious
character
certainly
nobility
that
is
enough
to
enable
her
to
approach
the
king
without
awkwardnessnot
too
lofty
so
as
not
to
trouble
herself
about
the
dignity
of
her
race
very
true
and
who
knows
a
little
english
mon
dieu
why
some
one
cried
madame
like
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
for
instance
oh
why
yes
said
louis
xiv
you
have
hit
the
markit
is
you
who
have
found
my
sister
i
will
take
her
she
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
i
suppose
oh
no
i
will
name
her
seductrice
plenipotentiaire
at
once
and
will
add
a
dowry
to
the
title
that
is
well
i
fancy
you
already
on
your
road
my
dear
little
sister
consoled
for
all
your
griefs
i
will
go
on
two
conditions
the
first
is
that
i
shall
know
what
i
am
negotiating
about
that
is
it
the
dutch
you
know
insult
me
daily
in
their
gazettes
and
by
their
republican
attitude
i
do
not
like
republics
that
may
easily
be
imagined
sire
i
see
with
pain
that
these
kings
of
the
seathey
call
themselves
sokeep
trade
from
france
in
the
indies
and
that
their
vessels
will
soon
occupy
all
the
ports
of
europe
such
a
power
is
too
near
me
sister
they
are
your
allies
nevertheless
that
is
why
they
were
wrong
in
having
the
medal
you
have
heard
of
struck
a
medal
which
represents
holland
stopping
the
sun
as
joshua
did
with
this
legend
the
sun
had
stopped
before
me
there
is
not
much
fraternity
in
that
is
there
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
that
miserable
episode
i
never
forget
anything
sister
and
if
my
true
friends
such
as
your
brother
charles
are
willing
to
second
me
the
princess
remained
pensively
silent
listen
to
me
there
is
the
empire
of
the
seas
to
be
shared
said
louis
xiv
for
this
partition
which
england
submits
to
could
i
not
represent
the
second
party
as
well
as
the
dutch
we
have
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
to
treat
that
question
replied
madame
your
second
condition
for
going
if
you
please
sister
the
consent
of
monsieur
my
husband
you
shall
have
it
then
consider
me
already
gone
brother
on
hearing
these
words
louis
xiv
turned
round
towards
the
corner
of
the
room
in
which
dartagnan
colbert
and
aramis
stood
and
made
an
affirmative
sign
to
his
minister
colbert
then
broke
in
on
the
conversation
suddenly
and
said
to
aramis
monsieur
lambassadeur
shall
we
talk
about
business
dartagnan
immediately
withdrew
from
politeness
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
fireplace
within
hearing
of
what
the
king
was
about
to
say
to
monsieur
who
evidently
uneasy
had
gone
to
him
the
face
of
the
king
was
animated
upon
his
brow
was
stamped
a
strength
of
will
the
expression
of
which
already
met
no
further
contradiction
in
france
and
was
soon
to
meet
no
more
in
europe
monsieur
said
the
king
to
his
brother
i
am
not
pleased
with
m
le
chevalier
de
lorraine
you
who
do
him
the
honor
to
protect
him
must
advise
him
to
travel
for
a
few
months
these
words
fell
with
the
crush
of
an
avalanche
upon
monsieur
who
adored
his
favorite
and
concentrated
all
his
affections
in
him
in
what
has
the
chevalier
been
inconsiderate
enough
to
displease
your
majesty
cried
he
darting
a
furious
look
at
madame
i
will
tell
you
that
when
he
is
gone
said
the
king
suavely
and
also
when
madame
here
shall
have
crossed
over
into
england
madame
in
england
murmured
monsieur
in
amazement
in
a
week
brother
continued
the
king
whilst
we
will
go
whither
i
will
shortly
tell
you
and
the
king
turned
on
his
heel
smiling
in
his
brothers
face
to
sweeten
as
it
were
the
bitter
draught
he
had
given
him
during
this
time
colbert
was
talking
with
the
duc
dalmeda
monsieur
said
colbert
to
aramis
this
is
the
moment
for
us
to
come
to
an
understanding
i
have
made
your
peace
with
the
king
and
i
owed
that
clearly
to
a
man
of
so
much
merit
but
as
you
have
often
expressed
friendship
for
me
an
opportunity
presents
itself
for
giving
me
a
proof
of
it
you
are
besides
more
a
frenchman
than
a
spaniard
shall
we
secureanswer
me
franklythe
neutrality
of
spain
if
we
undertake
anything
against
the
united
provinces
monsieur
replied
aramis
the
interest
of
spain
is
clear
to
embroil
europe
with
the
provinces
would
doubtless
be
our
policy
but
the
king
of
france
is
an
ally
of
the
united
provinces
you
are
not
ignorant
besides
that
it
would
infer
a
maritime
war
and
that
france
is
in
no
state
to
undertake
this
with
advantage
colbert
turning
round
at
this
moment
saw
dartagnan
who
was
seeking
some
interlocutor
during
this
aside
of
the
king
and
monsieur
he
called
him
at
the
same
time
saying
in
a
low
voice
to
aramis
we
may
talk
openly
with
dartagnan
i
suppose
oh
certainly
replied
the
ambassador
we
were
saying
m
dalmeda
and
i
said
colbert
that
a
conflict
with
the
united
provinces
would
mean
a
maritime
war
thats
evident
enough
replied
the
musketeer
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
monsieur
dartagnan
i
think
that
to
carry
on
such
a
war
successfully
you
must
have
very
large
land
forces
what
did
you
say
said
colbert
thinking
he
had
ill
understood
him
why
such
a
large
land
army
said
aramis
because
the
king
will
be
beaten
by
sea
if
he
has
not
the
english
with
him
and
that
when
beaten
by
sea
he
will
soon
be
invaded
either
by
the
dutch
in
his
ports
or
by
the
spaniards
by
land
and
spain
neutral
asked
aramis
neutral
as
long
as
the
king
shall
prove
stronger
rejoined
dartagnan
colbert
admired
that
sagacity
which
never
touched
a
question
without
enlightening
it
thoroughly
aramis
smiled
as
he
had
long
known
that
in
diplomacy
dartagnan
acknowledged
no
superior
colbert
who
like
all
proud
men
dwelt
upon
his
fantasy
with
a
certainty
of
success
resumed
the
subject
who
told
you
m
dartagnan
that
the
king
had
no
navy
oh
i
take
no
heed
of
these
details
replied
the
captain
i
am
but
an
indifferent
sailor
like
all
nervous
people
i
hate
the
sea
and
yet
i
have
an
idea
that
with
ships
france
being
a
seaport
with
two
hundred
exits
we
might
have
sailors
colbert
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
oblong
book
divided
into
two
columns
on
the
first
were
the
names
of
vessels
on
the
other
the
figures
recapitulating
the
number
of
cannon
and
men
requisite
to
equip
these
ships
i
have
had
the
same
idea
as
you
said
he
to
dartagnan
and
i
have
had
an
account
drawn
up
of
the
vessels
we
have
altogetherthirtyfive
ships
thirtyfive
ships
impossible
cried
dartagnan
something
like
two
thousand
pieces
of
cannon
said
colbert
that
is
what
the
king
possesses
at
this
moment
of
five
and
thirty
vessels
we
can
make
three
squadrons
but
i
must
have
five
five
cried
aramis
they
will
be
afloat
before
the
end
of
the
year
gentlemen
the
king
will
have
fifty
ship
of
the
line
we
may
venture
on
a
contest
with
them
may
we
not
to
build
vessels
said
dartagnan
is
difficult
but
possible
as
to
arming
them
how
is
that
to
be
done
in
france
there
are
neither
foundries
nor
military
docks
bah
replied
colbert
in
a
bantering
tone
i
have
planned
all
that
this
year
and
a
half
past
did
you
not
know
it
do
you
know
m
dimfreville
dimfreville
replied
dartagnan
no
he
is
a
man
i
have
discovered
he
has
a
specialty
he
is
a
man
of
geniushe
knows
how
to
set
men
to
work
it
is
he
who
has
cast
cannon
and
cut
the
woods
of
bourgogne
and
then
monsieur
lambassadeur
you
may
not
believe
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
but
i
have
a
still
further
idea
oh
monsieur
said
aramis
civilly
i
always
believe
you
calculating
upon
the
character
of
the
dutch
our
allies
i
said
to
myself
they
are
merchants
they
are
friendly
with
the
king
they
will
be
happy
to
sell
to
the
king
what
they
fabricate
for
themselves
then
the
more
we
buyah
i
must
add
this
i
have
forantdo
you
know
forant
dartagnan
colbert
in
his
warmth
forgot
himself
he
called
the
captain
simply
dartagnan
as
the
king
did
but
the
captain
only
smiled
at
it
no
replied
he
i
do
not
know
him
that
is
another
man
i
have
discovered
with
a
genius
for
buying
this
forant
has
purchased
for
me
350000
pounds
of
iron
in
balls
200000
pounds
of
powder
twelve
cargoes
of
northern
timber
matches
grenades
pitch
tari
know
not
what
with
a
saving
of
seven
per
cent
upon
what
all
those
articles
would
cost
me
fabricated
in
france
that
is
a
capital
and
quaint
idea
replied
dartagnan
to
have
dutch
cannonballs
cast
which
will
return
to
the
dutch
is
it
not
with
loss
too
and
colbert
laughed
aloud
he
was
delighted
with
his
own
joke
still
further
added
he
these
same
dutch
are
building
for
the
king
at
this
moment
six
vessels
after
the
model
of
the
best
of
their
name
destouchesah
perhaps
you
dont
know
destouches
no
monsieur
he
is
a
man
who
has
a
sure
glance
to
discern
when
a
ship
is
launched
what
are
the
defects
and
qualities
of
that
shipthat
is
valuable
observe
nature
is
truly
whimsical
well
this
destouches
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
man
likely
to
prove
useful
in
marine
affairs
and
he
is
superintending
the
construction
of
six
vessels
of
seventyeight
guns
which
the
provinces
are
building
for
his
majesty
it
results
from
this
my
dear
monsieur
dartagnan
that
the
king
if
he
wished
to
quarrel
with
the
provinces
would
have
a
very
pretty
fleet
now
you
know
better
than
anybody
else
if
the
land
army
is
efficient
dartagnan
and
aramis
looked
at
each
other
wondering
at
the
mysterious
labors
this
man
had
undertaken
in
so
short
a
time
colbert
understood
them
and
was
touched
by
this
best
of
flatteries
if
we
in
france
were
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
said
dartagnan
out
of
france
still
less
must
be
known
that
is
why
i
told
monsieur
lambassadeur
said
colbert
that
spain
promising
its
neutrality
england
helping
us
if
england
assists
you
said
aramis
i
promise
the
neutrality
of
spain
i
take
you
at
your
word
colbert
hastened
to
reply
with
his
blunt
bonhomie
and
a
propos
of
spain
you
have
not
the
golden
fleece
monsieur
dalmeda
i
heard
the
king
say
the
other
day
that
he
should
like
to
see
you
wear
the
grand
cordon
of
st
michael
aramis
bowed
oh
thought
dartagnan
and
porthos
is
no
longer
here
what
ells
of
ribbons
would
there
be
for
him
in
these
largesses
dear
porthos
monsieur
dartagnan
resumed
colbert
between
us
two
you
will
have
i
wager
an
inclination
to
lead
your
musketeers
into
holland
can
you
swim
and
he
laughed
like
a
man
in
high
good
humor
like
an
eel
replied
dartagnan
ah
but
there
are
some
bitter
passages
of
canals
and
marshes
yonder
monsieur
dartagnan
and
the
best
swimmers
are
sometimes
drowned
there
it
is
my
profession
to
die
for
his
majesty
said
the
musketeer
only
as
it
is
seldom
in
war
that
much
water
is
met
with
without
a
little
fire
i
declare
to
you
beforehand
that
i
will
do
my
best
to
choose
fire
i
am
getting
old
water
freezes
mebut
fire
warms
monsieur
colbert
and
dartagnan
looked
so
handsome
still
in
quasijuvenile
strength
as
he
pronounced
these
words
that
colbert
in
his
turn
could
not
help
admiring
him
dartagnan
perceived
the
effect
he
had
produced
he
remembered
that
the
best
tradesman
is
he
who
fixes
a
high
price
upon
his
goods
when
they
are
valuable
he
prepared
his
price
in
advance
so
then
said
colbert
we
go
into
holland
yes
replied
dartagnan
only
only
said
m
colbert
only
repeated
dartagnan
there
lurks
in
everything
the
question
of
interest
the
question
of
selflove
it
is
a
very
fine
title
that
of
captain
of
the
musketeers
but
observe
this
we
have
now
the
kings
guards
and
the
military
household
of
the
king
a
captain
of
musketeers
ought
to
command
all
that
and
then
he
would
absorb
a
hundred
thousand
livres
a
year
for
expenses
well
but
do
you
suppose
the
king
would
haggle
with
you
said
colbert
eh
monsieur
you
have
not
understood
me
replied
dartagnan
sure
of
carrying
his
point
i
was
telling
you
that
i
an
old
captain
formerly
chief
of
the
kings
guard
having
precedence
of
the
marechaux
of
francei
saw
myself
one
day
in
the
trenches
with
two
other
equals
the
captain
of
the
guards
and
the
colonel
commanding
the
swiss
now
at
no
price
will
i
suffer
that
i
have
old
habits
and
i
will
stand
or
fall
by
them
colbert
felt
this
blow
but
he
was
prepared
for
it
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
just
now
replied
he
about
what
monsieur
we
were
speaking
of
canals
and
marshes
in
which
people
are
drowned
well
well
if
they
are
drowned
it
is
for
want
of
a
boat
a
plank
or
a
stick
of
a
stick
however
short
it
may
be
said
dartagnan
exactly
said
colbert
and
therefore
i
never
heard
of
an
instance
of
a
marechal
of
france
being
drowned
dartagnan
became
very
pale
with
joy
and
in
a
not
very
firm
voice
people
would
be
very
proud
of
me
in
my
country
said
he
if
i
were
a
marechal
of
france
but
a
man
must
have
commanded
an
expedition
in
chief
to
obtain
the
baton
monsieur
said
colbert
here
is
in
this
pocketbook
which
you
will
study
a
plan
of
campaign
you
will
have
to
lead
a
body
of
troops
to
carry
out
in
the
next
spring
12
dartagnan
took
the
book
tremblingly
and
his
fingers
meeting
those
of
colbert
the
minister
pressed
the
hand
of
the
musketeer
loyally
monsieur
said
he
we
had
both
a
revenge
to
take
one
over
the
other
i
have
begun
it
is
now
your
turn
i
will
do
you
justice
monsieur
replied
dartagnan
and
implore
you
to
tell
the
king
that
the
first
opportunity
that
shall
offer
he
may
depend
upon
a
victory
or
to
behold
me
deador
both
then
i
will
have
the
fleursdelis
for
your
marechals
baton
prepared
immediately
said
colbert
on
the
morrow
aramis
who
was
setting
out
for
madrid
to
negotiate
the
neutrality
of
spain
came
to
embrace
dartagnan
at
his
hotel
let
us
love
each
other
for
four
said
dartagnan
we
are
now
but
two
and
you
will
perhaps
never
see
me
again
dear
dartagnan
said
aramis
if
you
knew
how
i
have
loved
you
i
am
old
i
am
extinctah
i
am
almost
dead
my
friend
said
dartagnan
you
will
live
longer
than
i
shall
diplomacy
commands
you
to
live
but
for
my
part
honor
condemns
me
to
die
bah
such
men
as
we
are
monsieur
le
marechal
said
aramis
only
die
satisfied
with
joy
in
glory
ah
replied
dartagnan
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
assure
you
monsieur
le
duc
i
feel
very
little
appetite
for
either
they
once
more
embraced
and
two
hours
after
separatedforever
the
death
of
dartagnan
contrary
to
that
which
generally
happens
whether
in
politics
or
morals
each
kept
his
promises
and
did
honor
to
his
engagements
the
king
recalled
m
de
guiche
and
banished
m
le
chevalier
de
lorraine
so
that
monsieur
became
ill
in
consequence
madame
set
out
for
london
where
she
applied
herself
so
earnestly
to
make
her
brother
charles
ii
acquire
a
taste
for
the
political
counsels
of
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
that
the
alliance
between
england
and
france
was
signed
and
the
english
vessels
ballasted
by
a
few
millions
of
french
gold
made
a
terrible
campaign
against
the
fleets
of
the
united
provinces
charles
ii
had
promised
mademoiselle
de
keroualle
a
little
gratitude
for
her
good
counsels
he
made
her
duchess
of
portsmouth
colbert
had
promised
the
king
vessels
munitions
victories
he
kept
his
word
as
is
well
known
at
length
aramis
upon
whose
promises
there
was
least
dependence
to
be
placed
wrote
colbert
the
following
letter
on
the
subject
of
the
negotiations
which
he
had
undertaken
at
madrid
monsieur
colberti
have
the
honor
to
expedite
to
you
the
r
p
oliva
general
ad
interim
of
the
society
of
jesus
my
provisional
successor
the
reverend
father
will
explain
to
you
monsieur
colbert
that
i
preserve
to
myself
the
direction
of
all
the
affairs
of
the
order
which
concern
france
and
spain
but
that
i
am
not
willing
to
retain
the
title
of
general
which
would
throw
too
high
a
sidelight
on
the
progress
of
the
negotiations
with
which
his
catholic
majesty
wishes
to
intrust
me
i
shall
resume
that
title
by
the
command
of
his
majesty
when
the
labors
i
have
undertaken
in
concert
with
you
for
the
great
glory
of
god
and
his
church
shall
be
brought
to
a
good
end
the
r
p
oliva
will
inform
you
likewise
monsieur
of
the
consent
his
catholic
majesty
gives
to
the
signature
of
a
treaty
which
assures
the
neutrality
of
spain
in
the
event
of
a
war
between
france
and
the
united
provinces
this
consent
will
be
valid
even
if
england
instead
of
being
active
should
satisfy
herself
with
remaining
neutral
as
for
portugal
of
which
you
and
i
have
spoken
monsieur
i
can
assure
you
it
will
contribute
with
all
its
resources
to
assist
the
most
christian
king
in
his
war
i
beg
you
monsieur
colbert
to
preserve
your
friendship
and
also
to
believe
in
my
profound
attachment
and
to
lay
my
respect
at
the
feet
of
his
most
christian
majesty

aramis
had
performed
more
than
he
had
promised
it
remained
to
be
seen
how
the
king
m
colbert
and
dartagnan
would
be
faithful
to
each
other
in
the
spring
as
colbert
had
predicted
the
land

entered
on
its
campaign
it
preceded
in
magnificent
order
the
court
of
louis
xiv
who
setting
out
on
horseback
surrounded
by
carriages
filled
with
ladies
and
courtiers
conducted
the
elite
of
his
kingdom
to
this
sanguinary
fete
the
officers
of
the
army
it
is
true
had
no
other
music
save
the
artillery
of
the
dutch
forts
but
it
was
enough
for
a
great
number
who
found
in
this
war
honor

m
dartagnan
set
out
commanding
a
body
of
twelve
thousand
men
cavalry
and
infantry
with
which
he
was
ordered
to
take
the
different
places
which
form
knots
of
that
strategic
network
called
la
frise
never
was
an
army
conducted
more
gallantly
to
an
expedition
the
officers
knew
that
their
leader
prudent
and
skillful
as
he
was
brave
would
not
sacrifice
a
single
man
nor
yield
an
inch
of
ground
without
necessity
he
had
the
old
habits
of
war
to
live
upon
the
country
keeping
his
soldiers
singing
and
the
enemy
weeping
the
captain
of

twelve
small
places
within
a
month
he
was
engaged
in
besieging
the
thirteenth
which
had
held
out
five
days
dartagnan
caused
the
trenches
to
be
opened
without
appearing
to
suppose
that
these
people
would
ever
allow
themselves
to
be
taken
the
pioneers
and
laborers
were
in
the
army
of
this
man
a
body
full
of
ideas
and
zeal
because
their
commander
treated
them
like
soldiers
knew
how
to
render
their
work
glorious
and
never
allowed
them
to
be
killed
if

could
help

should
have
been
seen
with
what
eagerness
the
marshy
glebes
of
holland
were
turned
over
those
turfheaps
mounds
of
potters
clay
melted
at
the
word
of
the
soldiers
like
butter
in
the
fryingpans
of
friesland
housewives
m
dartagnan
dispatched
a
courier
to
the
king
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
last
success
which
redoubled
the
good
humor
of
his
majesty
and
his
inclination
to
amuse
the
ladies
these
victories
of
m
dartagnan
gave
so
much
majesty
to
the
prince
that
madame
de
montespan
no
longer
called
him
anything
but
louis
the
invincible
so
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
who
only
called
the
king
louis
the
victorious
lost
much
of
his
majestys
favor
besides
her
eyes
were
frequently
red
and
to
an
invincible
nothing
is
more
disagreeable
than
a
mistress
who
weeps
while
everything
is
smiling
round
her
the
star
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
was
being
drowned
in
clouds
and
tears
but
the
gayety
of
madame
de
montespan
redoubled
with
the
successes
of
the
king
and
consoled
him
for
every
other
unpleasant
circumstance
it
was
to
dartagnan
the
king
owed
this
and
his
majesty
was
anxious
to
acknowledge
these
services
he
wrote
to
m
colbert
monsieur
colbertwe

a
promise
to
fulfil
with
m
dartagnan
who
so
well
keeps
his
this
is
to
inform
you
that
the
time
is
come
for
performing
it
all
provisions
for
this
purpose
you
shall
be
furnished
with
in
due
time
louis
in
consequence
of
this

detaining
dartagnans
envoy
placed
in
the
hands
of
that
messenger
a
letter
from
himself
and
a
small
coffer
of
ebony
inlaid
with
gold
not
very
important
in
appearance
but
which
without
doubt
was
very
heavy
as
a
guard
of
five
men
was
given
to
the
messenger
to
assist
him
in
carrying
it
these
people
arrived
before
the
place
which
dartagnan
was
besieging
towards
daybreak
and
presented
themselves
at
the
lodgings
of
the
general
they
were
told
that
m
dartagnan
annoyed
by
a
sortie
which
the
governor
an
artful
man
had
made
the
evening
before
and
in
which
the
works
had
been
destroyed
and
seventyseven
men
killed
and
the
reparation
of
the
breaches
commenced
had
just
gone
with
twenty
companies
of
grenadiers
to
reconstruct
the
works
m
colberts
envoy
had
orders
to
go
and
seek
m
dartagnan
wherever
he
might
be
or
at
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
he
directed
his
course
therefore
towards
the
trenches
followed
by
his
escort
all
on
horseback
they
perceived
m
dartagnan
in
the
open
plain
with
his
goldlaced
hat
his
long
cane
and
gilt
cuffs
he
was
biting
his
white
mustache
and
wiping
off
with
his
left
hand
the
dust
which
the
passing
balls
threw
up
from
the
ground
they
plowed
so
near
him
they
also
saw
amidst
this
terrible
fire
which
filled
the
air
with
whistling
hisses
officers
handling
the
shovel
soldiers
rolling
barrows
and
vast
fascines
rising
by
being
either
carried
or
dragged
by
from
ten
to
twenty
men
cover
the
front
of
the
trench
reopened
to
the
center
by
this
extraordinary
effort
of
the
general
in
three
hours
all
was
reinstated
dartagnan
began
to
speak
more
mildly
and
he
became
quite
calm
when
the
captain
of
the
pioneers
approached
him
hat
in
hand
to
tell
him
that
the
trench
was
again
in
proper
order
this
man
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
a
ball
took
off
one
of
his
legs
and
he
fell
into
the
arms
of
dartagnan
the
latter
lifted
up
his
soldier
and
quietly
with
soothing
words
carried
him
into
the
trench
amidst
the
enthusiastic
applause
of
the
regiments
from
that
time
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
valorthe
army
was
delirious
two
companies
stole
away
to
the
advanced
posts
which
they
instantly
destroyed
when
their
comrades
restrained
with
great
difficulty
by
dartagnan
saw
them
lodged
upon
the
bastions
they
rushed
forward
likewise
and
soon
a
furious
assault
was
made
upon
the
counterscarp
upon
which
depended
the
safety
of
the
place
dartagnan
perceived
there
was
only
one
means
left
of
checking
his
armyto
take
the
place
he
directed
all
his
force
to
the
two
breaches
where
the
besieged
were
busy
in
repairing
the
shock
was
terrible
eighteen
companies
took
part
in
it
and
dartagnan
went
with
the
rest
within
half
cannonshot
of
the
place
to
support
the
attack
by
echelons
the
cries
of
the
dutch
who
were
being
poniarded
upon
their
guns
by
dartagnans
grenadiers
were
distinctly
audible
the
struggle
grew
fiercer
with
the
despair
of
the
governor
who
disputed
his
position
foot
by
foot
dartagnan
to
put
an
end
to
the
affair
and
to
silence
the
fire
which
was
unceasing
sent
a
fresh
column
which
penetrated
like
a
very
wedge
and
he
soon
perceived
upon
the
ramparts
through
the
fire
the
terrified
flight
of
the
besieged
pursued
by
the
besiegers
at
this
moment
the
general
breathing
feely
and
full
of
joy
heard
a
voice
behind
him
saying
monsieur
if
you
please
from
m
colbert
he
broke
the
seal
of
the
letter
which
contained
these
words
monsieur
dartagnanthe
king
commands
me
to
inform
you
that
he
has
nominated
you
marechal
of
france
as
a
reward
for
your
magnificent
services
and
the
honor
you
do
to
his
arms
the
king
is
highly
pleased
monsieur
with
the
captures
you
have
made
he
commands
you
in
particular
to
finish
the
siege
you
have
commenced
with
good
fortune
to
you
and
success
for
him
dartagnan
was
standing
with
a
radiant
countenance
and
sparkling
eye
he
looked
up
to
watch
the
progress
of
his
troops
upon
the
walls
still
enveloped
in
red
and
black
volumes
of
smoke
i
have
finished
replied
he
to
the
messenger
the
city
will
have
surrendered
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
then
resumed
his
reading
the
coffret
monsieur
dartagnan
is
my
own
present
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
see
that
whilst
you
warriors
are
drawing
the
sword
to
defend
the
king
i
am
moving
the
pacific
arts
to
ornament
a
present
worthy
of
you
i
commend
myself
to
your
friendship

le
marechal
and
beg

colbert
dartagnan
intoxicated
with
joy
made
a
sign
to
the
messenger
who
approached
with
his
coffret
in
his
hands
but
at
the
moment
the
marechal
was
going
to
look
at
it
a
loud
explosion
resounded
from
the
ramparts
and
called
his
attention
towards
the
city
it
is
strange
said
dartagnan
that
i
dont
yet
see
the
kings
flag
on
the
walls
or
hear
the
drums
beat
the
chamade
he
launched
three
hundred
fresh
men
under
a
highspirited
officer
and
ordered
another
breach
to
be
made
then
more
tranquilly
he
turned
towards
the
coffret
which
colberts
envoy
held
out
to
himit
was
his
treasurehe
had
won
it
dartagnan
was
holding
out
his
hand
to
open
the
coffret
when
a
ball
from
the
city
crushed
the
coffret
in
the
arms
of
the
officer
struck
dartagnan
full
in
the
chest
and
knocked
him
down
upon
a
sloping
heap
of
earth
whilst
the
fleurdelised
baton
escaping
from
the
broken
box
came
rolling
under
the
powerless
hand
of
the
marechal
dartagnan
endeavored
to
raise
himself
it
was
thought
he
had
been
knocked
down
without
being
wounded
a
terrible
cry
broke
from
the
group
of
terrified
officers
the
marechal
was
covered
with
blood
the
pallor
of
death
ascended
slowly
to
his
noble
countenance
leaning
upon
the
arms
held
out
on
all
sides
to
receive
him
he
was
able
once
more
to
turn
his
eyes
towards
the
place
and
to
distinguish
the
white
flag
at
the
crest
of
the
principal
bastion
his
ears
already
deaf
to
the
sounds
of
life
caught
feebly
the
rolling
of
the
drum
which
announced
the
victory
then
clasping
in
his
nerveless
hand
the
baton
ornamented
with
its
fleursdelis
he
cast
on
it
his
eyes
which
had
no
longer
the
power
of
looking
upwards
towards
heaven
and
fell
back
murmuring
strange
words
which
appeared
to
the
soldiers
cabalisticwords
which
had
formerly
represented
so
many
things
on
